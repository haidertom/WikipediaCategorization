'''AZUPANE-Lagunillas''' was the first school for children with learning disabilities in the western region of [[Zulia]], Venezuela. The school was inaugurated in [[Lagunillas Municipality, Zulia]] by its founder, [[Betty Cecilia Lugo]], on May 4, 1974. It was later integrated into the government educational program, becoming a public school and renamed as "Institute of Special Education" Jesús Enrique Losada".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;"Inicó actividedes AZUPANE" (AZUPANE started activities), article reviewing the inaugural event of AZUPANE-Lagunillas, published by Maracaibo newspaper "Panorama", May 5, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="noticiaalminuto.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://noticiaalminuto.com/efemerides-20abr-nacio-betty-cecilia-lugo-filantropa-dedicada-al-zulia-y-confundadora-de-la-casa-de-la-misericordia/|title=¡EFEMÉRIDES! #20Abr Nació Betty Cecilia Lugo, filántropa dedicada al Zulia y confundadora de La Casa de la Misericordia - Noticia al Minuto|website=noticiaalminuto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The project==
In the early 1970s the western region of Zulia state included four municipalities and it was the main center of Venezuela's oil industry. Many international corporations, connected to oil and gas, had long time and successful business in the district.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Azupane Lagunillas", article published in "Shell Occidental", monthly local Venezuelan Shell oil Company magazine, June 1975 edition&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite being one of the richest regions in the country, Special Education was not included in the programs followed by local schools. There was not even awareness about the importance of integrating disabled children into the educational system.&lt;ref name="noticiaalminuto.com"/&gt;
[[File:Betty Cecilia Lugo.png|thumb|left|Venezuela philanthropist [[Betty Cecilia Lugo]], founder of AZUPANE-Lagunillas]]
This situation was perceived by philanthropist Betty Cecilia Lugo when she arrived in Lagunillas. Educated in Medicine and Special Education, she started a crusade in order to include special education into the local educational system. That is how the idea of starting a school for children with disabilities was born. The school was created primarily as a place where disabled children could be educated, have special activities outdoors and start to play sports. &lt;ref&gt;Azupane Lagunillas", article published in "Shell Occidental", monthly local Venezuelan Shell oil Company magazine, June 1974 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stages===
Betty Lugo started the project by creating awareness within the local community. She discussed the importance of Special Education with private companies and government institutions and built a fundraising committee. The most important achievement at this stage was to make possible that oil international companies included the project in their donation programs.&lt;ref&gt;“Mayoritario respaldo merece AZUPANE" (Azupane deserves strong support), Betty Lugo interview in the Maracaibo newspaper "Panorama", November 21, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name="noticiaalminuto.com"/&gt;

The second stage focused on the search and selection of teachers, to be chosen into a community where Special Education was an unknown field. Given her academic training on the subject, Betty Lugo took care of the education and guidance of selected teachers, training them as special educators.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The third stage aimed to find an appropriate building to start activities, which took one year of meetings with different public and private companies. The school was inaugurated on May 4, 1974, in a large building donated by Shell Company of Venezuela, located in Ciudad Ojeda, [[Lagunillas Municipality, Zulia]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The building had enough space for classrooms and offices. It also had a large garden, where children could develop psychomotor skills. Furniture and other equipment was purchased with money collected by the fundraising committee. &lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;"Inicó actividedes AZUPANE" (AZUPANE started activities), article reviewing the inaugural event of AZUPANE-Lagunillas, published by Maracaibo newspaper "Crítica", May 5, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

==The school==
[[File:Betty Cecilia Lugo. Charla.png|thumb|right|Betty Cecilia Lugo speaks to representatives of the local community, in order to create awareness about the need for Special Education]]
The name of the school was AZUPANE- Lagunillas ("{{lang|es|Asociación Zuliana de Padres y Amigos de Niños Excepcionales - Lagunillas}}", English: "Zulian Association of Parents and Friends of Exceptional Children" - Lagunillas district). It started with seven pupils while Betty Lugo, together with benefactors and local authorities, continued searching for disabled children within the region. Other cases in need for special education started to show up and the school soon began to increase the number of students. &lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

The school program was planned for children aged six to twelve years, suffering from neurological disorders, motor disabilities and communication and language problems. The main purpose was to create the appropriate atmosphere to grant academic learning, as well as the acquirement of social skills and the improvement of students quality of life.&lt;ref&gt; “Mayoritario respaldo merece AZUPANE" (Azupane deserves strong support), Betty Lugo interview in the Maracaibo newspaper "Panorama", November 21, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents took care of the student’s daily transportation to the school, till Shell Oil Company of Venezuela, one of the greatest benefactors of the project, donated a school bus and provided the gasoline. Betty Lugo donated to the school all her special educational material, acquired during her training years in the United States. This kind of special educational resource was not produced or imported in Venezuela, by the time AZUPANE - Lagunillas started.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Legacy==
While AZUPANE- Lagunillas was raising awareness for the need of special education, Betty Lugo continued her crusade by encouraging private and official organizations to create special schools throughout the region. When she left Lagunillas, at the end of the 1970s, the school had increased the number of students, the local society was attentive to children with special needs and the Ministry of Education was planning to develop similar projects in the area. AZUPANE-Lagunillas was lately absorbed by the government as part of its educational programs, and the school was renamed as Institute of Special Education “Jesús Enrique Lossada”.&lt;ref&gt;Azupane Lagunillas", article published in "Shell Occidental", monthly local Venezuelan Shell oil Company magazine, March 1979 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15385">'''Action painting''', sometimes called "'''gestural abstraction'''", is a style of [[painting]] in which paint is spontaneously dribbled, splashed or smeared onto the canvas, rather than being carefully applied.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting work often emphasizes the physical act of painting itself as an essential aspect of the finished work or concern of its artist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Background ==
The style was widespread from the 1940s until the early 1960s, and is closely associated with [[abstract expressionism]] (some critics have used the terms "action painting" and "[[abstract expressionism]]" interchangeably).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/art-history-definition-action-painting-183188|title=Art History Definition: Action Painting|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison is often drawn between the American action painting and the French [[tachisme]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[New York School (art)|The New York School]] of American Abstract Expressionism (1940s-50s) is also seen as closely linked to the movement.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/action-painting.htm|title=Action Painting Technique: Definition, Characteristics|website=www.visual-arts-cork.com|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined by the American critic [[Harold Rosenberg]] in 1952,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=9798
| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20160410120628/http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=9798

and signaled a major shift in the aesthetic perspective of [[New York School (art)|New York School]] painters and critics. According to Rosenberg the canvas was "an arena in which to act".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artsy.net/gene/action-painting|title=Action Painting {{!}} Artsy|website=www.artsy.net|language=en|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The actions and means for creating the painting were seen, in action painting, of a higher importance than the end result.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While Rosenberg created the term "action painting" in 1952, he began creating his action theory in the 1930s as a critic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slifkin|first=Robert|date=June 2011|title=The Tragic Image: Action Painting Refigured|url=https://cod.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=vth&amp;AN=64112998&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|journal=Oxford Art Journal|volume=34|pages=227–246|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; While abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Franz Kline]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] had long been outspoken in their view of a painting as an arena within which to come to terms with the act of creation, earlier critics sympathetic to their cause, like [[Clement Greenberg]], focused on their works' "objectness." Clement Greenberg was also an influential critic in action painting, intrigued by the creative struggle, which he claimed was evidenced by the surface of the painting.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  To Greenberg, it was the physicality of the paintings' clotted and oil-caked surfaces that was the key to understanding them. "Some of the labels that became attached to Abstract Expressionism, like "informel" and "Action Painting," definitely implied this; one was given to understand that what was involved was an utterly new kind of art that was no longer art in any accepted sense. This was, of course, absurd." &amp;ndash; Clement Greenberg, "Post Painterly Abstraction".

Rosenberg's critique shifted the emphasis from the object to the struggle itself, with the finished painting being only the physical manifestation, a kind of residue, of the actual work of art, which was in the act or process of the painting's creation. The newer research tends to put the exile-surrealist [[Wolfgang Paalen]] in the position of the artist and theoretician who used the term "action" at first in this sense and fostered the theory of the subjective struggle with it. In his theory of the viewer-dependent possibility space, in which the artist "acts" like in an ecstatic ritual, Paalen considers ideas of [[quantum mechanics]], as well as idiosyncratic interpretations of the totemic vision and the spatial structure of native-Indian painting from British Columbia. His long essay ''Totem Art'' (1943) had considerable influence on such artists as [[Martha Graham]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Mark Rothko]]; Paalen describes a highly artistic vision of totemic art as part of a ritual "action" with psychic links to genetic memory and matrilinear ancestor-worship.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Neufert, ''Auf Liebe und Tod, Das Leben des Surrealisten Wolfgang Paalen'', Berlin (Parthas) 2015, S. 494ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next two decades, Rosenberg's redefinition of art as an act rather than an object, as a process rather than a product, was influential, and laid the foundation for a number of major art movements, from [[Happening]]s and [[Fluxus]] to [[Conceptual Art|Conceptual]], [[Performance art]], [[Installation art]] and [[Earth Art]].

== Historical context ==
It is essential for the understanding of action painting to place it in historical context.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The action painting movement took place in the time after World War II ended. With this came a disordered economy and culture in Europe, and in America the government took advantage of their new state of importance.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=Jason Edwards|date=Spring 2008|title=What the Mind's Eye Sees: Action painters were postwar exemplars of American individualism|url=https://cod.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=vth&amp;AN=31308622&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|journal=American Scholar|volume=77|pages=113–117|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; A product of the [[post-World War II]] artistic resurgence of [[expressionism]] in [[United States|America]] and more specifically [[New York City]], action painting developed in an era where [[quantum mechanics]] and [[psychoanalysis]] were beginning to flourish and were changing people's perception of the physical and psychological world; and civilization's understanding of the world through heightened [[self-consciousness]] and awareness.

American action painters pondered the nature of art as well as the reasons for the existence of art often when questioning what the value of action painting is.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The preceding art of [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] had freed itself from the portrayal of objects and instead tried to evoke, address and delineate, through the aesthetic sense, emotions and feelings within the viewer. ''Action painting'' took this a step further, using both [[Jung]] and [[Freud]]’s ideas of the [[subconscious]] as its underlying foundations. Many of the painters were interested in Carl Jung's studies of archetypal images and types, and used their own internal visions to create their paintings.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Along with Jung, Sigmund Freud and Surrealism were also influential to the beginning of action painting.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The paintings of the Action painters were not meant to portray objects per se or even specific emotions. Instead they were meant to touch the observer deep in the subconscious mind, evoking a sense of the [[wikt:primeval|primeval]] and tapping the collective sense of an [[archetype|archetypal]] visual language. This was done by the artist painting "unconsciously," and spontaneously, creating a powerful arena of raw emotion and action, in the moment. Action painting was clearly influenced by the [[surrealist]] emphasis on [[Surrealist automatism|automatism]] which (also) influenced by psychoanalysis claimed a more direct access to the [[subconscious|subconscious mind]]. Important exponents of this concept of art making were the painters [[Joan Miró]] and [[André Masson]]. However the action painters took everything the surrealists had done a step further.

[[Image:Riparian buffer on Bear Creek in Story County, Iowa.JPG|right|thumb|[[Riparian buffer]] lining a creek in [[Iowa]]]]
'''Agricultural wastewater treatment''' is a farm management agenda for controlling pollution from surface runoff that may be contaminated by chemicals in fertiliser, pesticides, animal slurry, crop residues or irrigation water.

==Nonpoint source pollution==
[[Nonpoint source pollution]] from farms is caused by [[surface runoff]] from fields during rain storms.  Agricultural runoff is a major source of [[water pollution|pollution]], in some cases the only source, in many [[drainage basin|watersheds]].&lt;ref name="EPA-fact"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC. [http://www.epa.gov/owow/nps/Ag_Runoff_Fact_Sheet.pdf "Protecting Water Quality from Agricultural Runoff."] March 2005. Document No. EPA 841-F-05-001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sediment runoff===
[[Image:Eroded soils in Iowa.png|right|thumb|Highly erodible soils on a farm in [[Iowa]]]]
[[Soil]] washed off fields is the largest source of agricultural pollution in the United States. Excess sediment causes high levels of [[turbidity]] in water bodies, which can inhibit growth of [[aquatic plant]]s, clog [[fish]] [[gill]]s and smother animal [[larva]]e.&lt;ref name="EPA-fact" /&gt;

Farmers may utilize [[erosion control]]s to reduce runoff flows and retain soil on their fields. Common techniques include:

*[[crop rotation]]
*planting [[perennial]] crops
*installing [[riparian buffer]]s.&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm"&gt;EPA. [http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/agriculture/agmm_index.cfm "National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Agriculture."] July 2003. Document No. EPA-841-B-03-004.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp. 4-95–4-96}}

===Nutrient runoff===
{{main|Nutrient pollution}}
[[Image:Epandeur de Fumier Rolland.JPG|right|thumb|Manure spreader]]
[[Nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] are key pollutants found in runoff, and they are applied to farmland in several ways, such as in the form of commercial [[fertilizer]], animal [[manure]], or municipal or industrial wastewater (effluent) or sludge. These chemicals may also enter runoff from [[crop residue]]s, [[irrigation]] water, [[wildlife]], and [[Deposition (Aerosol physics)|atmospheric deposition]].&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm" /&gt;{{rp|p. 2–9}}

Farmers can develop and implement [[nutrient management]] plans to mitigate impacts on water quality by:
*mapping and documenting fields, crop types, [[soil type]]s, water bodies
*developing realistic [[crop yield]] projections
*conducting [[soil test]]s and nutrient analyses of manures and/or sludges applied
*identifying other significant nutrient sources (e.g., irrigation water)
*evaluating significant field features such as highly erodible soils, subsurface drains, and shallow aquifers
*applying fertilizers, manures, and/or sludges based on realistic yield goals and using [[precision agriculture]] techniques.&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm" /&gt;{{rp|pp. 4-37–4-38}}&lt;ref&gt;NRCS. [ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NHQ/practice-standards/standards/590.pdf "National Conservation Practice Standard: Nutrient Management."]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Code 590. August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pesticides===
[[Image:Crop Duster.jpg|right|thumb|[[Aerial application]] (crop dusting) of [[pesticide]]s over a [[soybean]] field in the U.S.]]
[[Pesticides]] are widely used by farmers to control plant [[pest (organism)|pests]] and enhance [[Agricultural productivity|production]], but chemical pesticides can also cause [[water quality]] problems.  Pesticides may appear in [[surface water]] due to:
*direct application (e.g. aerial spraying or [[broadcast spreader|broadcasting]] over water bodies)
*runoff during rain storms
*aerial drift (from adjacent fields).&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm" /&gt;{{rp|p.2–22}}
Some pesticides have also been detected in [[groundwater]].&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm" /&gt;{{rp|p.2–24}}

Farmers may use [[Integrated Pest Management]] (IPM) techniques (which can include [[biological pest control]]) to maintain control over pests, reduce reliance on chemical pesticides, and protect water quality.&lt;ref&gt;NRCS. [ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NHQ/practice-standards/standards/595.pdf National Conservation Practice Standard: Pest Management."]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Code 595. July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/factsheets/ipm.htm "Integrated Pest Management Principles."] March 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are few safe ways of disposing of pesticide surpluses other than through containment in well managed landfills or by [[incineration]]. In some parts of the world, spraying on land is a permitted method of disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wetlands-preserve.org/phpUpload/uploads/RS%20Smithfield.pdf|title=Boss Hog|last=Tietz|first=Jeff|date=December 14, 2006|website=Wetlands Preserve|access-date=March 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Waste Pesticide Management|url=http://www.deq.state.or.us/lq/pubs/factsheets/hw/WastePesticideManagementHowtoDispose.pdf|website=Oregon.Gov|publisher=State of Oregon Department of Environmental Quality Land Quality Division Hazardous Waste Program|accessdate=5 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202112958/http://www.deq.state.or.us/lq/pubs/factsheets/hw/WastePesticideManagementHowtoDispose.pdf|archive-date=2 February 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{fact|date=April 2012}}

==Point source pollution==
Farms with large [[livestock]] and [[poultry]] operations, such as [[factory farm]]s, can be a major source of [[point source pollution|point source]] wastewater.  In the United States, these facilities are called [[concentrated animal feeding operation]]s or ''confined animal feeding operations'' and are being subject to increasing government [[regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.epa.gov/npdes/animal-feeding-operations-afos |title=Animal Feeding Operations |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-01-17 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal wastes===
[[Image:Confined-animal-feeding-operation.jpg|right|thumb|Confined animal feeding operation in the [[United States]]]]
The constituents of animal wastewater typically contain&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrec.org/pubs/dairy%20waste%20handbook.pdf Dairy Waste Anaerobic Digestion Handbook] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015073309/http://www.mrec.org/pubs/dairy%20waste%20handbook.pdf |date=October 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatanksales.com/agriculturalwaste.html|title=Agricultural Waste|website=usatanksales.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Strong organic content — much stronger than human sewage
*High [[total suspended solids|solids]] concentration
*High [[nitrate]] and phosphorus content
*[[Antibiotics]]
*Synthetic [[hormones]]
*Often high concentrations of [[parasite]]s and their eggs
*Spores of ''[[Cryptosporidiosis|Cryptosporidium]]'' (a protozoan) resistant to drinking water treatment processes
*Spores of ''[[Giardia]]''
*Human pathogenic [[Bacterium|bacteria]] such as ''[[Brucellosis|Brucella]]'' and ''[[Salmonella]]''

Animal wastes from cattle can be produced as solid or semisolid manure or as a liquid [[slurry]]. The production of slurry is especially common in housed dairy cattle.

;Treatment
Whilst solid manure heaps outdoors can give rise to polluting wastewaters from runoff, this type of waste is usually relatively easy to treat by containment and/or covering of the heap.

Animal slurries require special handling and are usually treated by containment in lagoons before disposal by spray or trickle application to grassland. [[Constructed wetland]]s are sometimes used to facilitate treatment of animal wastes, as are [[anaerobic lagoons]]. Excessive application or application to sodden land or insufficient land area can result in direct runoff to watercourses, with the potential for causing severe [[pollution]]. Application of slurries to land overlying [[aquifer]]s can result in direct contamination or, more commonly, elevation of nitrogen levels as [[nitrite]] or nitrate.

The disposal of any wastewater containing animal waste upstream of a drinking water intake can pose serious health problems to those drinking the water because of the highly resistant spores present in many animals that are capable of causing disabling disease in humans. This risk exists even for very low-level seepage via shallow surface drains or from rainfall run-off.

Some animal slurries are treated by mixing with straws and [[Composting|composted]] at high temperature to produce a bacteriologically sterile and friable manure for soil improvement.

===Piggery waste===
[[Image:Hog confinement barn interior.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pig|Hog]] confinement barn or [[piggery]]]]

Piggery waste is comparable to other animal wastes and is processed as for general animal waste, except that many piggery wastes contain elevated levels of [[copper]] that can be toxic in the natural environment. The liquid fraction of the waste is frequently separated off and re-used in the piggery to avoid the prohibitively expensive costs of disposing of copper-rich liquid. [[Ascariasis|Ascarid]] worms and their eggs are also common in piggery waste and can infect humans if wastewater treatment is ineffective.

===Silage liquor===
Fresh or wilted [[grass]] or other green crops can be made into a semi-[[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] product called [[silage]] which can be stored and used as winter forage for cattle and sheep. The production of silage often involves the use of an acid conditioner such as [[sulfuric acid]] or [[formic acid]]. The process of silage making frequently produces a yellow-brown strongly smelling liquid which is very rich in simple [[sugars]], [[alcohol]], short-chain organic acids and silage conditioner. This liquor is one of the most polluting organic substances known. The volume of silage liquor produced is generally in proportion to the moisture content of the ensiled material.

;Treatment
Silage liquor is best treated through prevention by wilting crops well before silage making. Any silage liquor that is produced can be used as part of the food for pigs.
The most effective treatment is by containment in a slurry lagoon and by subsequent spreading on land following substantial dilution with slurry. Containment of silage liquor on its own can cause structural problems in concrete pits because of the acidic nature of silage liquor.

===Milking parlour (dairy farming) wastes===
Although milk is an important food product, its presence in wastewaters is highly polluting because of its organic strength, which can lead to very rapid [[Hypoxia (environmental)|de-oxygenation]] of receiving waters. [[Dairy farming#Milking parlors|Milking parlour]] wastes also contain large volumes of wash-down water, some animal waste together with cleaning and [[disinfection]] chemicals.

;Treatment
Milking parlour wastes are often treated in [[mixture|admixture]] with human sewage in a local [[sewage treatment]] plant. This ensures that disinfectants and cleaning agents are sufficiently diluted and amenable to treatment. Running milking wastewaters into a farm slurry lagoon is a possible option although this tends to consume lagoon capacity very quickly. Land spreading is also a treatment option. ''See also [[Industrial wastewater treatment]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wastewater treatment|url=https://watertreatmentservices.co.uk/wastewater-treatment/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slaughtering waste===
Wastewater from slaughtering activities is similar to milking parlour waste (see above) although considerably stronger in its organic composition and therefore potentially much more polluting.

;Treatment
As for milking parlour waste (see above).

===Vegetable washing water===
Washing of [[vegetable]]s produces large volumes of water contaminated by soil and vegetable pieces. Low levels of pesticides used to treat the vegetables may also be present together with moderate levels of disinfectants such as [[chlorine]].

;Treatment
Most vegetable washing waters are extensively recycled with the solids removed by settlement and filtration. The recovered soil can be returned to the land.

===Firewater===
Although few farms plan for fires, fires are nevertheless more common on farms than on many other industrial premises. Stores of  pesticides, herbicides, fuel oil for farm machinery and fertilizers can all help promote fire and can all be present in environmentally lethal quantities in [[Firewater (fire fighting)|firewater]] from [[firefighting|fire fighting]] at farms.

'''Treatment'''&lt;br /&gt;
All farm environmental management plans should allow for containment of substantial quantities of firewater and for its subsequent recovery and disposal by specialist disposal companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/PMHO600BBUD-e-e.pdf|title=Managing Fire water and major spillages - Environment Agency Guidance note PPG18 ( retrieved 19 April 2009)|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219043323/http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/PMHO600BBUD-e-e.pdf|archivedate=19 December 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concentration and mixture of contaminants in firewater make them unsuited to any treatment method available on the farm. Even land spreading has produced severe taste and odour problems for downstream water supply companies in the past.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3577">[[Image:CARIBU at ATLAS.jpg|thumb|Scientists inspecting the [[surface ionization]] source. The source charges the breeder by providing stable beams.]]
The '''Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System''' ('''ATLAS''') is a scientific user facility at [[Argonne National Laboratory]]. ATLAS is the first [[Superconductivity|superconducting]] [[linear accelerator]] for [[heavy ion]]s at energies in the vicinity of the [[Coulomb barrier]].

The '''ATLAS''' accelerator at Argonne should not be confused with the [[ATLAS experiment]] at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]].

== How ATLAS works ==
Ions are generated from one of two sources: the 9-MV electrostatic tandem [[Van de Graaff generator|Van de Graaff]] accelerator or the Positive Ion Injector, a 12-MV low-velocity [[Linear particle accelerator|linac]] and [[electron cyclotron resonance]] (ECR) ion source. The ions are sent from one of these two into the 20-MV 'booster' linac, then to the 20-MV 'ATLAS' linac section.

The ATLAS linac section contains 62 resonators, each one of seven different type. Each type accelerates ions to a particular velocity. Each resonator is also tunable to allow for a wide range of velocities.

The ions in the ATLAS linac are aligned into a beam which exits the linac into one of three experimental areas. The experiment areas contain [[Scattering#Scattering in particle physics|scattering]] chambers, [[Spectrometer|spectrometers and spectrographs]], [[beamline]]s, a [[gamma-ray]] facility, and [[particle detector]]s.

== What ATLAS is for ==
The energy levels of the ions produces by ATLAS are ideal to study the properties of the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. Specifically, understanding reactions between nuclei from very low energies (typically encountered in burning stars) to the very highest energies (encountered soon after the "Big Bang"). Nuclei with specific properties can be studied to understand fundamental interactions.

== What is ATLAS made of ==
[[Niobium]] is the primary metal used to construct the tubes [http://www.phy.anl.gov/atlas/images/split_loop1.jpg] in the individual in-line resonators. Niobium is used because it is relatively cheap, yet it is a [[Superconducting|superconductor]] at relatively high temperatures. The difficulties is in its malleability, which is quite poor making it difficult to construct the shapes needed for the resonators. The machinists working at ATLAS are some of the only people in the world able to work with niobium to the degree necessary for construction and repair of the ATLAS parts.&lt;ref name="DWest"&gt;{{cite speech

'''Centro de Estudios Científicos''' ('''CECs'''; Center for Scientific Studies) is a [[Privately-held company|private]], [[non-profit]] [[corporation]] based in [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]], [[Chile]], devoted to the development, promotion and diffusion of [[scientific research]]. CECs research areas include [[biophysics]], [[molecular physiology]], [[theoretical physics]], [[glaciology]] and [[climate change]]. The centre was created in 1984 as Centro de Estudios Científicos de Santiago, with a grant of 150,000 dollars a year (for three years) from the [[Tinker Foundation]] of [[New York City]]. In 2004-2005 glaciologists from CECs organized the [[Chilean South Pole Expedition]] in collaboration with the [[Chilean Navy]] and [[Instituto Antártico Chileno]]. CECs was founded in Santiago but is since 2000 housed in the recently modernized, German-style Hotel Schuster located by [[Valdivia River]]. [[Claudio Bunster]], a physicist and winner of Chile's [[National Prize for Exact Sciences (Chile)|National Prize for Exact Sciences]], is the director of CECs.

In 2014 CECs discovered what would be a [[subglacial lake]] in the [[West Antarctica]], They investigated and concluded after a year that it is a lake, which was named [[Lake CECs]] in honor of the institution. The conclusion was published in ''[[Geophysical Research Letters]]'' on May 22, 2015. 
The authors of the discovery are Andrés Rivera, Jose Uribe, Rodrigo Zamora and Jonathan Oberreuter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CECs Article|url=http://www.CECs.cl/website/index.php/en/menu-noticias/1092-cientificos-del-CECs-descubren-nuevo-lago-subglacial-en-la-antartica-occidental}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Classical music''' is [[art music]] produced or rooted in the traditions of [[Western culture]], including both [[Religious music|liturgical]] (religious) and [[secular music|secular]] music. While a more precise term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]]), this article is about the broad span of time from before the 6th century AD to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods.&lt;ref name="Music 2007"&gt;"Classical", ''The Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music'', ed. Michael Kennedy, (Oxford, 2007), ''Oxford Reference Online''. Retrieved July 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the [[common practice period|common-practice period]]. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:
* the [[ancient music]] period, before 500 AD
* the [[early music]] period, which includes
** the [[Medieval music|Medieval]] (500–1400) including

European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European classical and some [[popular music]]al forms by its system of [[musical notation|staff notation]], in use since about the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Notation, §III, 1(vi): Plainchant: Pitch-specific notations, 13th–16th centuries|author1=Geoffrey Chew|author2=Richard Rastall|last-author-amp=yes|access-date=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}}&lt;!--Says absolutely nothing at all about European art music, let alone what may or may not distinguish it from other types of music. Moreover, III, 1(vi) is specifically addressed to developments in the 13th-to-16th centuries, saying nothing about the origins of staff notation.--&gt; Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern European musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] (which form the [[melody|melodies]], [[bassline]]s and [[Chord (music)|chords]]), [[tempo]], [[Metre (music)|metre]] and [[rhythm]]s for a piece of music.{{clarify |date=April 2017|reason=Staff notation merely indicates pitches and durations. It does not by itself indicate whether these result in melody, bassline, chords}} This can leave less room for practices such as [[musical improvisation|improvisation]] and ''[[ad libitum]]'' [[Ornament (music)|ornamentation]], which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Japan, §III, 1: Notation systems: Introduction|author=Malm, W.P.|author2=Hughes, David W.|access-date=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify |date=April 2017|reason=The article states that improvisation "hardly exists in Japanese music."}}&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Notation, §I: General|author=Ian D.

Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song ([[strophic]]) form or a derivation of this form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the [[symphony]], [[concerto]], [[fugue]], [[sonata]], and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as [[opera]], [[cantata]], and [[Mass (music)|mass]].&lt;ref name="Julian Johnson 2002 p. 63"&gt;Julian Johnson (2002) ''Who Needs Classical Music?: Cultural Choice and Musical Value'': p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "classical music" did not appear until the early 19th century, in an attempt to distinctly canonize the period from [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] to [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] as a golden age.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rushton, Julian]], ''Classical Music'', (London, 1994), 10&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to "classical music" recorded by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is from about 1829.&lt;ref name="Music 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OED_Online_Classical"&gt;{{cite web|author=The Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=The OED Online|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50040930?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=classical&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10|accessdate=May 10, 2007|title=classical, a.|year=2007|quote=1829   V.

Novello Mozart Pilgrimage (1955) 181   This is the place I should come to every Sunday when I wished to hear classical music correctly and judiciously performed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}}
Given the wide range of styles in European classical music, from Medieval [[plainchant]] sung by monks to Classical and Romantic symphonies for orchestra from the 1700s and 1800s to avant-garde [[atonal]] compositions for solo piano from the 1900s, it is difficult to list characteristics that can be attributed to all works of that type. However, there are characteristics that classical music contains that few or no other genres of music contain,&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (2006), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; such as the use of [[music notation]]{{clarify |date=April 2017|reason=If "classical music" began in 500, then at least five centuries of it were without notation.}} and the performance of complex forms of solo instrumental works (e.g., the [[fugue]]). Furthermore, while the symphony did not exist prior to the late 18th century, the [[Orchestra|symphony ensemble]]—and the [[Symphony|works written for it]]—have become a defining feature of classical music.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Literature===
The key characteristic of European classical music that distinguishes it from [[popular music]] and [[folk music]] is that the repertoire tends to be written down in [[musical notation]], creating a musical part or [[Sheet music|score]]. This score typically determines details of rhythm, pitch, and, where two or more musicians (whether singers or instrumentalists) are involved, how the various parts are coordinated. The written quality of the music has enabled a high level of complexity within them: [[fugue]]s, for instance, achieve a remarkable marriage of boldly distinctive melodic lines weaving in [[counterpoint]] yet creating a coherent [[Diatonic function|harmonic logic]] that would be difficult to achieve in the heat of live improvisation.&lt;ref name="Knud Jeppesen 2007"&gt;[[Knud Jeppesen]]: "Bach's music grows out of an ideally harmonic background, against which the voices develop with a bold independence that is often breath-taking." Quoted from Adele Katz (1946; reprinted 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify |date=April 2017|reason=Jeppesen says this as a comparison between Palestrina's contrapuntal writing and Bach's harmonic conception, but this has nothing to do with improvisation, nor with notation.}} The use of written notation also preserves a record of the works and enables Classical musicians to perform music from many centuries ago. Musical notation enables 2000s-era performers to sing a choral work from the 1300s Renaissance era or a 1700s Baroque concerto with many of the features of the music (the melodies, lyrics, forms, and rhythms) being reproduced.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

That said, the score does allow the interpreter to make choices on how to perform a historical work.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} For example, if the tempo is written with an Italian instruction (e.g., Allegro), it is not known exactly how fast the piece should be played. As well, in the Baroque era, many works that were designed for [[basso continuo]] accompaniment do not specify which instruments should play the accompaniment or exactly how the chordal instrument (harpsichord, lute, etc.) should play the chords, which are not notated in the part{{clarify|date=April 2017|reason=Does this uncertainty determine whether the music is "classical" or not?}} (only a [[figured bass]] symbol in the bass part is used to guide the chord-playing performer). The performer and the conductor have a range of options for musical expression and interpretation of a scored piece, including the phrasing of melodies, the time taken during [[fermata]]s (held notes) or pauses, and the use (or choice not to use) of effects such as vibrato or glissando (these effects are possible on various stringed, brass and woodwind instruments and with the human voice).

Although Classical music in the 2000s has lost most of its tradition for [[musical improvisation]], from the Baroque era to the Romantic era, there are examples of performers who could improvise in the style of their era. In the Baroque era, organ performers would improvise [[prelude (music)|preludes]], keyboard performers playing [[harpsichord]] would improvise [[chord (music)|chords]] from the [[figured bass]] symbols beneath the bass notes of the basso continuo part and both vocal and instrumental performers would improvise [[musical ornament]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Solis, Bruno Nettl. ''Musical Improvisation: Art, Education, and Society.'' University of Illinois Press, 2009. p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Johann Sebastian Bach was particularly noted for his complex improvisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.middlebury.edu/~harris/MusicPapers/baroque.html |title=On Baroque Improvisation |publisher=Community.middlebury.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Classical era, the composer-performer Mozart was noted for his ability to improvise melodies in different styles.&lt;ref&gt;David Grayson. Mozart: Piano Concertos Nos. 20 and 21. Cambridge University Press, 1998. p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; During the Classical era, some virtuoso soloists would improvise the [[cadenza]] sections of a concerto. During the Romantic era, Beethoven would improvise at the piano.&lt;ref&gt;Tilman Skowroneck. ''Beethoven the Pianist''. Cambridge University Press, 2010. p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; For more information, see [[#Improvisation|Improvisation]].

===Instrumentation and vocal practices===
{{See also|Woodwind section|Brass section|String section|Percussion section|Keyboard section}}
The instruments currently used in most classical music were largely invented before the mid-19th century (often much earlier) and systematised in the 18th and 19th centuries. They consist of the instruments found in an [[orchestra]] or in a [[concert band]], together with several other solo instruments (such as the [[piano]], [[harpsichord]], and [[organ (music)|organ]]). The symphony orchestra is the most widely known medium for classical music&lt;ref name="Kirgiss" /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}}&lt;!--There is no mention of orchestras at all on this page.--&gt; and includes members of the [[string instrument|string]], [[woodwind]], [[brass instrument|brass]], and [[percussion]] families of instruments. The concert band consists of members of the woodwind, brass, and percussion families. It generally has a larger variety and number of woodwind and brass instruments than the orchestra but does not have a string section. However, many concert bands use a [[double bass]]. The vocal practices changed over the classical period, from the single line monophonic [[Gregorian chant]] done by monks in the Medieval period to the complex, [[polyphonic]] choral works of the Renaissance and subsequent periods, which used multiple independent vocal melodies at the same time.

====Medieval music====
Many of the instruments used to perform medieval music still exist, but in different forms. Medieval instruments included the [[flute]], the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] and plucked [[string instrument]]s like the [[lute]]. As well, early versions of the [[Organ (music)|organ]] and [[fiddle]] (or [[vielle]]) existed. Medieval instruments in Europe had most commonly been used singly, often self accompanied with a [[drone (music)|drone]] note, or occasionally in parts. From at least as early as the 13th century through the 15th century there was a division of instruments into ''haut'' (loud, shrill, outdoor instruments) and ''bas'' (quieter, more intimate instruments).{{sfn|Bowles|1954|loc=119 et passim}} During the [[Early Middle Ages|earlier medieval period]], the vocal music from the [[liturgy|liturgical]] genre, predominantly [[Gregorian chant]], was [[Monophony|monophonic]], using a single, unaccompanied vocal melody line.&lt;ref name="Hoppin57"&gt;Hoppin (1978) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polyphony|Polyphonic]] vocal genres, which used multiple independent vocal melodies, began to develop during the [[High Middle Ages|high medieval era]], becoming prevalent by the later 13th and early 14th century.

====Renaissance music====
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
Many instruments originated during the Renaissance; others were variations of, or improvements upon, instruments that had existed previously. Some have survived to the present day; others have disappeared, only to be re-created in order to perform music on period instruments. As in the modern day, instruments may be classified as brass, strings, percussion, and woodwind. Brass instruments in the Renaissance were traditionally played by professionals who were members of [[Guild]]s and they included the [[slide trumpet]], the wooden [[cornet]], the valveless [[trumpet]] and the [[sackbut]]. Stringed instruments included the [[viol]], the [[rebec]], the harp-like [[lyre]], the [[hurdy-gurdy]], the [[lute]], the [[guitar]], the [[cittern]], the [[Bandora (instrument)|bandora]], and the [[orpharion]]. Keyboard instruments with strings included the [[harpsichord]] and the [[virginal]]s.{{Clarify|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Isn't the virginals a type of harpichord? If not, then the dedicated article linked here needs to be corrected.--&gt; Percussion instruments include the [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], the [[Jew's harp]], the [[tambourine]], the bells, the rumble-pot, and various kinds of drums. Woodwind instruments included the double reed [[shawm]], the [[reed pipe]], the [[bagpipe]], the [[transverse flute]], the [[Recorder (instrument)|recorder]], the [[dulcian]], and the [[crumhorn]]. Vocal music in the Renaissance is noted for the flourishing of an increasingly elaborate [[polyphony|polyphonic]] style. The principal liturgical forms which endured throughout the entire Renaissance period were masses and motets, with some other developments towards the end, especially as composers of sacred music began to adopt secular forms (such as the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]) for their own designs. Towards the end of the period, the early dramatic precursors of opera such as monody, the [[madrigal comedy]], and the [[intermedio]] are seen. Around 1597, Italian composer [[Jacopo Peri]] wrote ''[[Dafne]]'', the first work to be called an [[opera]] today. He also composed [[Euridice (Peri)|Euridice]], the first opera to have survived to the present day.

====Baroque music====
{{refimprove|section|date=November 2017}}
Baroque instruments included some instruments from the earlier periods (e.g., the hurdy-gurdy and recorder) and a number of new instruments (e.g, the oboe, bassoon, cello, contrabass and fortepiano). Some instruments from previous eras fell into disuse, such as the shawm and the wooden cornet. The key Baroque instruments for strings included the [[Baroque violin|violin]], [[viol]], [[viola]], [[viola d'amore]], [[cello]], [[contrabass]], [[lute]], [[theorbo]] (which often played the [[basso continuo]] parts), [[mandolin]], [[cittern]], [[Baroque guitar]], [[harp]] and hurdy-gurdy. Woodwinds included the [[Baroque flute]], [[Baroque oboe]], [[rackett]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] and the [[bassoon]]. Brass instruments included the [[cornett]], [[natural horn]], [[Baroque trumpet]], [[Serpent (instrument)|serpent]] and the [[trombone]]. Keyboard instruments included the [[clavichord]]&lt;!--the [[tangent piano]] --&gt;, the [[harpsichord]], the [[Organ (music)|pipe organ]], and, later in the period, the [[fortepiano]] (an early version of the piano). Percussion instruments included the [[timpani]], [[snare drum]], [[tambourine]] and the [[castanets]].

One major difference between Baroque music and the classical era that followed it is that the types of instruments used in Baroque ensembles were much less standardized. Whereas a classical era [[string quartet]] consists almost exclusively of two violins, a viola and a cello, a Baroque or Classical-era group accompanying a soloist or opera{{non sequitur |date=June 2018 |reason=comparing a Classical-era string quartet with an orchestra from the same period makes nonsense of the comparison of Baroque and Classical usage of instruments}} could include one of several different types of keyboard instruments (e.g., pipe organ, harpsichord, or clavichord),{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;!--Who claims that clavichords could be used to accompany soloists or operas?--&gt; additional stringed chordal instruments (e.g., a lute) and an unspecified number of bass instruments performing the basso continuo, including bowed strings, woodwinds and brass instruments (e.g., a cello, contrabass, viol, bassoon, serpent, etc.).

Vocal developments in the Baroque era included the development of [[opera]] types such as [[opera seria]] and [[opéra comique]], and related forms such as [[oratorio]]s and [[cantata]]s.&lt;ref name="BritannicaCantata"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cantata|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/cantata-music|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BritannicaOratorio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oratorio|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/oratorio|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Classical music====
{{or-section|date=April 2017}}
The term "classical music" has two meanings: the broader meaning includes all Western art music from the Medieval era to the 2000s, and the specific meaning refers to the [[art music]] from the 1750s to the early 1820s—the period of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Joseph Haydn]], and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. This section is about the more specific meaning. Classical era musicians continued to use many of instruments from the Baroque era, such as the cello, contrabass, recorder, trombone, timpani, fortepiano (the precursor to the modern [[piano]]) and organ. While some Baroque instruments fell into disuse (e.g., the theorbo and rackett), many Baroque instruments were changed into the versions that are still in use today, such as the Baroque violin (which became the [[violin]]), the Baroque oboe (which became the [[oboe]]) and the Baroque trumpet, which transitioned to the regular valved trumpet. During the Classical era, the stringed instruments used in orchestra and [[chamber music]] such as [[string quartet]]s were standardized as the four instruments which form the [[string section]] of the [[orchestra]]: the violin, viola, cello and double bass. Baroque-era stringed instruments such as fretted, bowed [[viol]]s were phased out. Woodwinds included the [[basset clarinet]], [[basset horn]], [[clarinette d'amour]], the Classical [[clarinet]], the [[chalumeau]], the flute, oboe and bassoon. Keyboard instruments included the [[clavichord]] and the [[fortepiano]]. While the [[harpsichord]] was still used in basso continuo accompaniment in the 1750s and 1760s, it fell out of use in the end of the century. Brass instruments included the [[buccin]], the [[ophicleide]] (a replacement for the bass [[serpent (instrument)|serpent]], which was the precursor of the [[tuba]]) and the [[natural horn]].

====Romantic music====
In the Romantic era, the modern [[piano]], with a more powerful, sustained tone and a wider range took over from the more delicate-sounding fortepiano. In the orchestra, the existing Classical instruments and sections were retained ([[string section]], woodwinds, brass and percussion), but these sections were typically expanded to make a fuller, bigger sound. For example, while a Baroque orchestra may have had two double bass players, a Romantic orchestra could have as many as ten. "As music grew more expressive, the standard orchestral palette just wasn't rich enough for many Romantic composers." &lt;ref name="classicfm.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicfm.com/discover/periods/romantic/romantic-music-beginners-guide/#FaXJhIVlfVSph9bq.97 |title=Romantic music: a beginner's guide – Music Periods |publisher=Classic FM |date= |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; New woodwind instruments were added, such as the [[contrabassoon]], [[bass clarinet]] and [[piccolo]] and new percussion instruments were added, including [[xylophone]]s, [[snare drum]]s, [[celesta]]s (a bell-like keyboard instrument), [[bell]]s, and [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangles]],&lt;ref name="classicfm.com"/&gt; large [[orchestral harp]]s, and even [[wind machine]]s for [[sound effect]]s. [[Saxophone]]s appear in some scores from the late 19th century onwards. While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works, for example [[Maurice Ravel]]'s orchestration of [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]'s ''[[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]]'', the saxophone is included in other works, such as Ravel's ''[[Boléro]]'', [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)#Orchestral suites extracted from Romeo and Juliet|Romeo and Juliet Suites 1 and 2]] and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. The [[euphonium]] is featured in a few late [[Romantic music|Romantic]] and [[20th-century classical music|20th-century]] works, usually playing parts marked "tenor tuba", including [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'', and [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]''.

The [[Wagner tuba]], a modified member of the horn family, appears in [[Richard Wagner]]'s cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and several other works by Strauss, [[Béla Bartók]], and others; it has a prominent role in [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 7 in E Major]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wagner-tuba.com/ |title=The Wagner Tuba |publisher=The Wagner Tuba |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornets appear in [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'', [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]'', and several orchestral works by [[Hector Berlioz]].{{clarify|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Why single out these composers in particular? Cornets appear regularly in 19th-century scores, alongside trumpets which were regarded as less agile, at least until the end of the century.--&gt; Unless these instruments are played by members doubling on another instrument (for example, a trombone player changing to euphonium for a certain passage), orchestras will use [[freelance]] musicians to augment their regular rosters.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Modernist music====

[[Modernism (music)|Modernism in music]] is a philosophical and aesthetic stance underlying the period of change and development in musical language that occurred from 1890 to 1930, a period of diverse reactions in challenging and reinterpreting older categories of music, innovations that lead to new ways of organizing and approaching harmonic, melodic, sonic, and rhythmic aspects of music, and changes in aesthetic worldviews in close relation to the larger identifiable period of [[modernism]] in the arts of the time. The operative word most associated with it is "innovation".{{sfn|Metzer|2009|loc=3}} Its leading feature is a "linguistic plurality", which is to say that no single [[music genre]] ever assumed a dominant position.{{sfn|Morgan|1984|loc=443}}

==== Contemporary classical music ====
[[Contemporary classical music]] is the period that came into prominence in the mid-1970s.  It includes different variations of [[Modernism (music)|modernist]], [[Postmodern music|postmodern]], [[Neoromanticism (music)|neoromantic]], and [[Eclecticism in music|pluralist music]].&lt;ref&gt;Botstein "[http://www.grovemusic.com Modernism]" §9: The Late 20th Century (subscription access).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the term may also be employed in a broader sense to refer to all post-1945 musical forms.&lt;ref&gt;"Contemporary" in Du Noyer 2003, 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Postmodern music ====
&lt;!--Everything in this sections is at odds with the linked article on Postmodern music.--&gt;
[[Postmodern music]] is a period of music that began around 1930.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{harvnb|Karolyi|1994|loc=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{harvnb|Meyer|1994|loc=331–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shares characteristics with [[postmodern art|postmodernist art]] – that is, art that comes after and reacts against [[modernism]].

==== Post-postmodern instrumentation ====
Many instruments that in the 2010s are associated with popular music filled important roles in early music, such as [[bagpipes]], [[theorbo]]s, [[vihuela]]s, [[hurdy-gurdy|hurdy-gurdies]] (hand-cranked string instruments), [[accordion]]s, [[alphorn]]s, [[Water organ#Hydraulis|hydraulises]], [[Calliope (music)|calliopes]], [[sistrum]]s, and some woodwind instruments such as [[tin whistle]]s, [[panpipes]], [[shawms]] and [[crumhorn]]s. On the other hand, instruments such as the [[acoustic guitar]], once associated mainly with popular music, gained prominence in classical music in the 19th and 20th centuries in the form of the [[classical guitar]] and [[banjo]]. While [[equal temperament]] gradually became accepted as the dominant [[musical temperament]] during the 19th century, different historical temperaments are often used for music from earlier periods. For instance, music of the [[English Renaissance]] is often performed in [[meantone temperament]]. As well, while professional [[orchestra]]s and pop bands all around the world have tuned to an A fixed at 440&amp;nbsp;Hz since the late 19th century, there was historically a great variety in the tuning pitch, as attested to in historical pipe organs that still exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Story of "A:" More about Baroque pitch|url=http://pbosf.blogspot.ca/2010/01/story-of-more-about-baroque-pitch.html|website=Philadelphia Baroque Orchestra|accessdate=3 November 2017|date=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{reliable source|date=November 2017}}

===Performance===
[[File:Concertband.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Youth [[concert band]] in performance]]

Performers who have studied classical music extensively are said to be "classically trained". This training may come from private lessons from instrument or voice teachers or from completion of a formal program offered by a Conservatory, college or university, such as a [[Bachelor of Music]] or [[Master of Music]] degree (which includes individual lessons from professors). In classical music, "...extensive formal music education and training, often to postgraduate [Master's degree] level" is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inputyouth.co.uk/jobguides/job-classicalmusician.html |title=Job Guide – Classical Musician |publisher=Inputyouth.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance of classical music repertoire requires a proficiency in [[sight-reading]] and [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] playing, [[Harmony|harmonic]] principles, strong [[ear training]] (to correct and adjust pitches by ear), knowledge of [[performance practice]] (e.g., Baroque ornamentation), and a familiarity with the style/musical idiom expected for a given composer or musical work (e.g., a Brahms symphony or a Mozart concerto).{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Some "popular" genre musicians have had significant classical training, such as [[Billy Joel]], [[Elton John]], the [[Van Halen]] brothers, [[Randy Rhoads]], [[Ritchie Blackmore]], and [[Dream Theater]] members.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Moreover, formal training is not unique to the classical genre. Many rock and pop musicians have completed degrees in [[Pop music|commercial music]] programs such as those offered by the [[Berklee College of Music]] and many [[jazz]] musicians have completed degrees in music from universities with jazz programs, such as the [[Manhattan School of Music]] and [[McGill University]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====Gender of performers====
{{Main article|Women in music}}
Historically, major professional [[orchestra]]s have been mostly or entirely composed of musicians who are men. Some of the earliest cases of [[women in music|women being hired in professional orchestras]] was in the position of [[harp]]ist. The [[Vienna Philharmonic]], for example, did not accept women to permanent membership until 1997, far later than the other orchestras ranked among the world's top five by ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' in 2008.&lt;ref name="The world's greatest orchestras"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/editorial/the-world%E2%80%99s-greatest-orchestras |title=The world's greatest orchestras |work=gramophone.co.uk |date= 2012-10-24|accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last major orchestra to appoint a woman to a permanent position was the [[Berlin Philharmonic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James R. Oestreich]], [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/berlin-in-lights-the-woman-question/ "Berlin in Lights: The Woman Question"], Arts Beat, ''The New York Times'', 16 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As late as February 1996, the Vienna Philharmonic's principal flute, Dieter Flury, told ''[[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]]'' that accepting women would be "gambling with the emotional unity ({{Lang|de|emotionelle Geschlossenheit}}) that this organism currently has".&lt;ref name=WDR5&gt;Westdeutscher Rundfunk Radio 5, "Musikalische Misogynie", 13 February 1996, [http://www.osborne-conant.org/wdrgerm.htm transcribed by Regina Himmelbauer]; [http://www.osborne-conant.org/wdr.htm translation by William Osborne]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1996, the orchestra's press secretary wrote that "compensating for the expected leaves of absence" of [[maternity leave]] would be a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osborne-conant.org/posts/schuster.htm |title=The Vienna Philharmonic's Letter of Response to the Gen-Mus List |work=Osborne-conant.org |date=1996-02-25 |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the Vienna Philharmonic was "facing protests during a [US] tour" by the [[National Organization for Women]] and the [[International Alliance for Women in Music]]. Finally, "after being held up to increasing ridicule even in socially conservative Austria, members of the orchestra gathered [on 28 February 1997] in an extraordinary meeting on the eve of their departure and agreed to admit a woman, Anna Lelkes, as harpist."&lt;ref name=JP&gt;Jane Perlez, [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/28/world/vienna-philharmonic-lets-women-join-in-harmony.html "Vienna Philharmonic Lets Women Join in Harmony"], ''The New York Times'', February 28, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the orchestra has six female members; one of them, violinist Albena Danailova became one of the orchestra's [[concertmaster]]s in 2008, the first woman to hold that position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.france24.com/en/20080508-vienna-opera-albena-danailova-first-female-concertmaster-austria&amp;navi= Vienna opera appoints first ever female concertmaster]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[France 24]]&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the orchestra's membership.

In 2013, an article in ''Mother Jones'' stated that while "[m]any prestigious orchestras have significant female membership—women outnumber men in the [[New York Philharmonic]]'s violin section—and several renowned ensembles, including the [[National Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Detroit Symphony]], and the Minnesota Symphony, are led by women violinists", the [[double bass]], brass, and percussion sections of major orchestras "...are still predominantly male."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hannah Levintova |url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/09/women-conductors-gap-charts-marin-alsop-proms |title=Here's Why You Seldom See Women Leading a Symphony |publisher=Mother Jones |date= |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 BBC article stated that the "...introduction of [[Blind audition|'blind' auditions]], where a prospective instrumentalist performs behind a screen so that the judging panel can exercise no gender or racial prejudice, has seen the gender balance of traditionally male-dominated symphony orchestras gradually shift."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burton |first=Clemency |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20130821-why-so-few-women-conductors |title=Culture – Why aren't there more women conductors? |publisher=BBC |date=2014-10-21 |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complexity===
Works of classical repertoire often exhibit complexity in their use of [[orchestration]], [[counterpoint]], [[harmony]], [[musical development]], [[rhythm]], [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], [[Texture (music)|texture]], and [[musical form|form]]. Whereas most popular styles are usually written in [[Ternary form|song form]], classical music is noted for its development of highly sophisticated instrumental musical forms,&lt;ref name="Julian Johnson 2002 p. 63"/&gt; like the [[concerto]], [[symphony]] and [[sonata]]. Classical music is also noted for its use of sophisticated vocal/instrumental forms, such as [[opera]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--Who claims opera is a "sophisticated" form?--&gt; In opera, vocal soloists and choirs perform staged dramatic works with an orchestra providing accompaniment. Longer instrumental works are often divided into self-contained pieces, called [[movement (music)|movements]], often with contrasting characters or moods. For instance, symphonies written during the Classical period are usually divided into four movements: (1) an opening Allegro in [[sonata form]], (2) a slow movement, (3) a minuet or scherzo (in a [[triple metre]], such as 3/4), and (4) a final Allegro. These movements can then be further broken down into a hierarchy of smaller units: first [[Section (music)|sections]], then [[Period (music)|periods]], and finally [[Phrase (music)|phrases]].

{{History of Western art music}}
{{Main article|History of music}}
The major time divisions of classical music up to 1900 are the [[Early music]] period, which includes [[Medieval music|Medieval]] (500–1400) and [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] (1400–1600) eras, and the [[Common practice period]], which includes the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] (1600–1750), [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] (1750–1820) and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] (1810–1910) eras.} The current period encompasses the [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] (1901–2000) and includes most of the Early [[modernism (music)|modern]] musical era (1890–1930), the entire [[high modernism|High modern]] (mid 20th-century), and the first part of the [[Contemporary classical music|Contemporary]] (1945 or 1975–current) or [[postmodern music|Postmodern]] musical era (1930–current). The [[21st-century classical music|21st century]] has so far been a continuation of the same period and the same Contemporary/Postmodern musical era which both began mostly in the 20th-century.

The dates are [[Dates of classical music eras|generalizations]], since the periods and eras overlap and the categories are somewhat arbitrary, to the point that some authorities reverse terminologies and refer to a common practice "era" comprising baroque, classical, and romantic "periods".&lt;ref name="Mode and tempo"&gt;{{cite web |author= Vladimir J. Konecni|title= Mode and tempo in Western classical music of the common-practice era |year=2009 |url= https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/36604/1/EMR000064b_Konecni.pdf|accessdate= 17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the use of [[counterpoint]] and [[fugue]], which is considered characteristic of the Baroque era (or period), was continued by [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], who is classified as typical of the Classical era. [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], who is often described as a founder of the Romantic era, and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], who is classified as Romantic, also used counterpoint and fugue, but the romantic and sometimes yearning qualities of their music define their era.

The prefix ''neo-'' is used to describe a 19th-, 20th-, or 21st-century composition written in the style of an earlier era, such as Classical or Romantic. [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky's]] ''[[Pulcinella (ballet)|Pulcinella]]'', for example, is a [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassical]] composition because it is stylistically similar to works of the Baroque era.{{Clarify|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--So a "Neo-medieval" work might be so-called because it resembles Renaissance music??--&gt;

===Roots===
{{Main article|Ancient music}}

Burgh (2006), suggests that the roots of Western classical music ultimately lie in ancient Egyptian art music via [[cheironomy]] and the ancient Egyptian orchestra, which dates to 2695 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Listening to Artifacts: Music Culture in Ancient Israel/Palestine|first=Theodore W.|last=Burgh|publisher=T. &amp; T. Clark Ltd.|year=2006|isbn=978-0567025524}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of individual tones and scales was made by ancient Greeks such as [[Aristoxenus]] and [[Pythagoras]].&lt;ref name="Grout73p28"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Pythagoras created a tuning system and helped to codify [[musical notation]]. Ancient Greek instruments such as the [[aulos]] (a [[reed instrument]]) and the [[lyre]] (a stringed instrument similar to a small harp) eventually led to the modern-day instruments of a classical orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Grout88|Grout (1988)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The antecedent to the early period was the era of [[ancient music]] before the fall of the [[Roman Empire]] (476 AD).

===Early period===
{{Main article|Medieval music|Renaissance music}}
{{See also|List of Medieval composers|List of Renaissance composers}}

[[File:Vielle.jpg|thumb|Musician playing the [[vielle]] (fourteenth-century [[Medieval]] [[manuscript]])]]

The Medieval period includes music from after the fall of Rome to about 1400. [[Monophony|Monophonic]] chant, also called plainsong or [[Gregorian chant]], was the dominant form until about 1100.&lt;ref name="Grout73p75"/&gt; Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern European musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church.{{sfn|Hall, Neitz, and Battani|2003|p=99}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=3fExcE3ouRYC&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;vq=catholic%20monks%20classical%20music&amp;dq=catholic%20monks%20classical%20music&amp;pg=PA173#v=snippet&amp;q=catholic%20monks%20classical%20music&amp;f=false |title = Making Music and Having a Blast!: A Guide for All Music Students|first1= Bonnie |last1= Blanchard |first2= Cynthia |last2=Blanchard Acree |publisher = Indiana University Press|date = 2009|isbn = 9780-253003355 |page = 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fnu0BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA256&amp;dq=catholic+monks+classical+music#v=onepage&amp;q=catholic+monks+classical+music&amp;f=false|title=The Rough Guide to Classical Music|first=Rough|last=Guides|date=May 3, 2010|publisher=Rough Guides UK|accessdate=June 21, 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=978-1848366770}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polyphony|Polyphonic]] (multi-voiced) music developed from monophonic chant throughout the late [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[Renaissance]], including the more complex voicings of [[motet]]s. The Renaissance era was from 1400 to 1600. It was characterized by greater use of [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]], multiple interweaving melodic lines, and the use of the first [[Bass (sound)|bass instruments]]. Social dancing became more widespread, so musical forms appropriate to accompanying dance began to standardize. It is in this time that the notation of music on a [[staff (music)|staff]] and other elements of [[musical notation]] began to take shape.&lt;ref name="Grout73p61"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; This invention made possible the separation of the [[Musical composition|composition]] of a piece of music from its ''transmission''; without written music, transmission was oral, and subject to change every time it was transmitted. With a [[Sheet music|musical score]], a work of music could be performed without the composer's presence.&lt;ref name="Grout73p75"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of the movable-type [[printing press]] in the 15th century had far-reaching consequences on the preservation and transmission of music.&lt;ref name="Grout73p175"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 175–76&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:white mensural notation.gif|thumb|left|[[Johannes Ockeghem]], Kyrie "Au travail suis" excerpt]]

Typical stringed instruments of the early period include the harp, [[lute]], [[vielle]], and [[psaltery]], while wind instruments included the [[flute]] family (including [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]), [[shawm]] (an early member of the [[oboe]] family), trumpet, and the [[bagpipes]]. Simple [[pipe organ]]s existed, but were largely confined to churches, although there were portable varieties.&lt;ref name="Grout73p72"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 72–74&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the period, early versions of [[keyboard (music)|keyboard]] instruments like the [[clavichord]] and [[harpsichord]] began to appear. Stringed instruments such as the [[viol]] had emerged by the 16th century, as had a wider variety of brass and reed instruments. Printing enabled the standardization of descriptions and specifications of instruments, as well as instruction in their use.&lt;ref name="Grout73p222"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 222–225&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable Medieval composers include [[Hildegard of Bingen]], [[Guillaume de Machaut]], [[Léonin]], [[Pérotin]], [[Philippe de Vitry]], [[Francesco Landini]], and [[Johannes Ciconia]].

Notable Renaissance composers include [[Josquin des Prez]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[John Dunstaple]], [[Johannes Ockeghem]], [[Orlande de Lassus]], [[Guillaume Du Fay]], [[Gilles Binchois]], [[Thomas Tallis]], [[William Byrd]], [[Giovanni Gabrieli]], [[Carlo Gesualdo]], [[John Dowland]], [[Jacob Obrecht]], [[Adrian Willaert]], [[Jacques Arcadelt]], and [[Cipriano de Rore]].

===Common-practice period===
The [[common practice period]] is usually defined as the era between the formation and the dissolution of the hegemony{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} of common-practice [[tonality]].&lt;!-- sentence copied in part from https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Common_practice_period&amp;oldid=799911529--&gt;  The term usually spans roughly two-and-a-half centuries, encompassing the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods.

====Baroque music====
{{Main article|Baroque music}}
{{See also|List of Baroque composers}}

[[File:Baschenis - Musical Instruments.jpg|thumb|Baroque instruments including [[hurdy-gurdy]], [[harpsichord]], [[bass viol]], [[lute]], [[baroque violin|violin]], and [[baroque guitar]]]]

Baroque music is characterized by the use of complex tonal [[counterpoint]] and the use of a [[basso continuo]], a continuous bass line. Music became more complex in comparison with the simple songs of all previous periods.&lt;ref name=Kirgiss&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirgiss|first=Crystal|title=Classical Music|year=2004|page=6|publisher=Black Rabbit Books|isbn=978-1583406748}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginnings of the [[sonata form]] took shape in the [[canzona]], as did a more formalized notion of [[theme and variations]]. The tonalities of [[major and minor]] as means for managing dissonance and [[chromaticism]] in music took full shape.&lt;ref name="Grout73p300"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 300–32&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Baroque era, keyboard music played on the [[harpsichord]] and [[pipe organ]] became increasingly popular, and the violin family of stringed instruments took the form generally seen today. Opera as a staged musical drama began to differentiate itself from earlier musical and dramatic forms, and vocal forms like the [[cantata]] and [[oratorio]] became more common.&lt;ref name="Grout73p341"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 341–55&lt;/ref&gt; Vocalists for the first time began adding extra notes to the music.&lt;ref name=Kirgiss/&gt; Instrumental ensembles began to distinguish and standardize by size{{clarify|date=November 2017|reason=as far as I know, instrumental ensembles were far from being standardized in size by Bach's time}}, giving rise to the early orchestra for larger ensembles, with [[chamber music]] being written for smaller groups of instruments where parts are played by individual (instead of massed) instruments. The [[concerto]] as a vehicle for solo performance{{clarify|date=November 2017|reason=and what of the concerto grosso?}} accompanied by an orchestra became widespread.

The theories surrounding [[equal temperament]] began to be put in wider practice, especially as it enabled a wider range of chromatic possibilities in hard-to-tune keyboard instruments. Although Bach did not use equal temperament, as a modern piano is generally tuned, changes in the temperaments from the [[meantone|meantone system]], common at the time, to various temperaments that made modulation between all keys musically acceptable, made possible Bach's ''[[Well-Tempered Clavier]]''.&lt;ref name="Grout73p378"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;

Important composers of this era include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Antonio Vivaldi]], [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Domenico Scarlatti]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]], [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], and [[Heinrich Schütz]].

====Classical-era (or -period) music====
{{Main article|Classical period (music)}}
{{See also|List of Classical-era composers}}

[[File:Haydnportrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph Haydn]] (1732–1809) c.&amp;nbsp;1770]]

The Classical era, from about 1750 to 1820, established many of the norms of composition, presentation, and style, and was also when the piano became the predominant keyboard instrument. The ''basic'' forces required for an [[orchestra]] became somewhat standardized (although they would grow as the potential of a wider array of instruments was developed in the following centuries). Chamber music grew to include ensembles with as many as 8 to 10 performers for [[serenade#Classical and Romantic eras|serenades]]. [[Opera]] continued to develop, with regional styles in Italy, France, and German-speaking lands. The ''[[opera buffa]]'', a form of comic opera, rose in popularity. The [[symphony]] came into its own as a musical form, and the concerto was developed as a vehicle for displays of virtuoso playing skill. Orchestras no longer required a [[harpsichord]] (which had been part of the traditional ''continuo'' in the Baroque style), and were often led by the lead violinist (now called the [[concertmaster]]).&lt;ref name="Grout73p463"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind instruments became more refined in the Classical era. While [[double reed|double-reed]] instruments like the [[oboe]] and [[bassoon]] became somewhat standardized in the Baroque, the [[clarinet]] family of [[single reed]]s was not widely used until [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] expanded its role in orchestral, chamber, and concerto settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ward Kingdon|first1=Martha|title=Mozart and the clarinet|issue=2|pages=126–153|url=https://academic.oup.com/ml/article-abstract/XXVIII/2/126/1375956?redirectedFrom=PDF|journal=Music and Letters|volume=XXVIII|accessdate=5 November 2017|language=en|doi=10.1093/ml/XXVIII.2.126|date=1 April 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major composers of this period include [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[Luigi Boccherini]], [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], [[Muzio Clementi]], [[Antonio Salieri]], and [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]].

====Romantic-era music====
{{Main article|Romantic music}}
{{See also|List of Romantic-era composers}}

The music of the Romantic era, from roughly the first decade of the 19th century to the early 20th century, was characterized by increased attention to an extended melodic line, as well as expressive and emotional elements, paralleling [[romanticism]] in other art forms. Musical forms began to break from the Classical era forms (even as those were being codified), with free-form pieces like [[nocturne]]s, [[Fantasia (music)|fantasias]], and [[Prelude (music)|preludes]] being written where accepted ideas about the exposition and development of themes were ignored or minimized.&lt;ref name="Swafford200"&gt;[[#Swafford|Swafford]], p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; The music became more chromatic, dissonant, and tonally colorful, with tensions (with respect to accepted norms of the older forms) about key signatures increasing.&lt;ref name="Swafford201"&gt;[[#Swafford|Swafford]], p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; The [[art song]] (or ''Lied'') came to maturity in this era, as did the epic scales of [[grand opera]], ultimately transcended by [[Richard Wagner]]'s [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring cycle]].&lt;ref name="Grout73p595"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 595–612&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, musical institutions emerged from the control of wealthy patrons, as composers and musicians could construct lives independent of the nobility. Increasing interest in music by the growing middle classes throughout western Europe spurred the creation of organizations for the teaching, performance, and preservation of music. The piano, which achieved its modern construction in this era (in part due to industrial advances in [[metallurgy]]) became widely popular with the middle class, whose demands for the instrument spurred a large number of piano builders. Many symphony orchestras date their founding to this era.&lt;ref name="Swafford201"/&gt; Some musicians and composers were the stars of the day; some, like [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Niccolò Paganini]], fulfilled both roles.&lt;ref name="Grout73p543"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], p. 543&lt;/ref&gt;

The family of instruments used, especially in orchestras, grew. A wider array of percussion instruments began to appear. Brass instruments took on larger roles, as the introduction of [[rotary valve]]s made it possible for them to play a wider range of notes. The size of the orchestra (typically around 40 in the Classical era) grew to be over 100.&lt;ref name="Swafford201"/&gt; [[Gustav Mahler]]'s 1906 [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 8]], for example, has been performed with over 150 instrumentalists and choirs of over 400.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pitcher|first=John|date=January 2013|title=Nashville Symphony|url=|journal=American Record Guide|volume=76, no. 1|pages=8–10|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European cultural ideas and institutions began to follow colonial expansion into other parts of the world. There was also a rise, especially toward the end of the era, of [[nationalism in music]] (echoing, in some cases, political sentiments of the time), as composers such as [[Edvard Grieg]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], and [[Antonín Dvořák]] echoed traditional music of their homelands in their compositions.&lt;ref name="Grout73p634"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 634, 641–42&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent composers of this era include [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Frédéric Chopin]], [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Richard Wagner]], [[Johannes Brahms]], and [[Johann Strauss II]].

Prominent composers of the early 20th century include [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Claude Debussy]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Anton Webern]], [[Alban Berg]], [[Aram Khachaturian]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Edvard Grieg]], and [[Béla Bartók]]. Although composers of this time can be considered Romantic, usually their works are not in the style of the period.{{Clarify|date=November 2017}}

{{See also| High modernism|List of 20th-century classical composers|List of 21st-century classical composers}}

Encompassing a wide variety of [[Post-romanticism|post-Romantic]] styles composed through the year 2000, 20th-century classical music includes late romantic, impressionist, neoclassical, neoromantic, neomedieval, and postmodern styles of composition. [[Modernism (music)|Modernism]] (1890–1930) marked an era when many composers rejected certain values of the common practice period, such as traditional tonality, melody, instrumentation, and structure. The high-modern era saw the emergence of neo-classical and [[serial music]]. A few authorities have claimed high-modernism as the beginning of [[postmodern music]] from about 1930.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Karolyi says nothing at all about high modernism, let along equate it with the postmodern era, the beginning of which he plants firmly in 1930.--&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Meyer does not equate high modernism with post-modernism.--&gt; Others have more or less equated postmodern music with the "contemporary music" composed from the late 20th century through to the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan 1995, 217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beard and Gloag|2005|loc=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in classical music===
{{see also|Women in classical music}}
Almost all of the composers who are described in music textbooks on classical music and whose works are widely performed as part of the [[Western canon|standard concert repertoire]] are male composers, even though there has been a [[List of female composers|large number of women composers]] throughout the classical music period. Musicologist [[Marcia Citron]] has asked "[w]hy is [[Women in music|music composed by women]] so marginal to the standard 'classical' repertoire?"&lt;ref name=Citron&gt;Citron, Marcia J. "Gender and the Musical Canon." CUP Archive, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Citron "examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received '[[Western canon|canon]]' of performed musical works." She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote [[art song]]s for performance in small recitals rather than [[symphony|symphonies]] intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers.&lt;ref name=Citron /&gt; In the "...''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann|Clara S[c]humann]] is one of the only{{sic}} female composers mentioned."&lt;ref name=rvanews&gt;{{cite web|author=Abbey Philips|url=http://rvanews.com/features/spacebomb-truth-lies-somewhere-in-between/49992|title=The history of women and gender roles in music|publisher=Rvanews.com|date=2011-09-01|accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbey Philips states that "[d]uring the 20th century the women who were composing/playing gained far less attention than their male counterparts."&lt;ref name=rvanews /&gt;

==Significance of written notation==

===Literalist view of the significance of the score===
While there are differences between particular performances of a classical work, a piece of classical music is generally held to transcend any interpretation of it. The use of musical notation is an effective method for transmitting classical music, since the written music contains the technical instructions for performing the work.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The written [[sheet music|score]], however, does not usually contain explicit instructions as to how to interpret the piece in terms of production or performance, apart from directions for [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[tempo]] and expression (to a certain extent). This is left to the discretion of the performers, who are guided by their personal experience and musical education, their knowledge of the work's idiom, their personal artistic tastes, and the accumulated body of historic performance practices.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Criticism of the literalist view===
All critics express the opinion that it is only from the mid-19th century, and especially in the 20th century, that the score began to hold such a high significance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Previously, improvisation (in preludes, cadenzas and ornaments), rhythmic flexibility (e.g., [[tempo rubato]]), improvisatory deviation from the score and [[oral tradition]] of playing was integral to the style.{{Clarify|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Which "style"? The "Neoromanticism" of Berlioz? The Romanticism of Schubert? Notre Dame organum?--&gt; Classical musicians tend to use scores and the parts extracted from them to play music. Yet, even with notation providing the key elements of the music, there is considerable latitude in the performance of the works. Some of this latitude results from the inherent limitations of musical notation, though attempts to supplement traditional notation with signs and annotations indicating more subtle nuances tend to overwhelm and paralyse the performer.

Some quotes that highlight a criticism of overvaluing of the score:
* "... one of the most stubborn modern misconceptions concerning baroque music is that a metronomic regularity was intended" (Baroque Interpretation in [[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|''Grove'' 5th edition]] by [[Robert Donington]])
* "Too many teachers, conditioned to 20th century ideas, teach Bach and other Baroque music exactly the wrong way. This leads to what musicologist [[Sol Babitz]] calls 'sewing machine Bach'."{{clarify|date=July 2016}}&lt;!--What has this quote to do with over-valuing scores?--&gt;&lt;ref name=conservatories_kill_expression /&gt;
* "... tendency to look alike, sound alike and think alike. The conservatories are at fault and they have been at fault for many years now. Any sensitive musician going around the World has noted the same thing. The conservatories, from Moscow and Leningrad to Juilliard, Curtis and Indiana, are producing a standardized product.&lt;br /&gt;[...] clarity, undeviating rhythm, easy technique, 'musicianship'. I put the word musicianship in quotes, because as often as not, it is a false kind of musicianship—a musicianship that sees the tree and not the forest, that takes care of the detail but ignores the big picture; a musicianship that is tied to the printed note rather than to emotional meaning of a piece.&lt;br /&gt;The fact remains that there is a dreadful uniformity today and also an appalling lack of knowledge about the culture and performance traditions of the past." ("Music Schools Turning out Robots?"&lt;ref name=conservatories_kill_expression&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1873&amp;dat=19691019&amp;id=dpMeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ncsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=874,4160516 "Music Schools Turning out Robots?"] by [[Harold C. Schonberg]]; ''Daytona Beach Morning Journal'' – October 19, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Harold C. Schonberg]])

===Improvisation===
{{Essay|section|date=July 2016}}
[[musical improvisation|Improvisation]] once played an important role in classical music. A remnant of this improvisatory tradition in classical music can be heard in the [[cadenza]], a passage found mostly in concertos and solo works, designed to allow skilled performers to exhibit their virtuoso skills on the instrument. Traditionally this was improvised by the performer; however, it is often written for (or occasionally by) the performer beforehand. Improvisation is also an important aspect in authentic performances of operas of Baroque era and of bel canto (especially operas of [[Vincenzo Bellini]]), and is best exemplified by the ''[[da capo aria]]'', a form by which famous singers typically perform variations of the thematic matter of the aria in the recapitulation section ('B section' / the 'da capo' part). An example is [[Beverly Sills]]' complex, albeit pre-written, variation of "Da tempeste il legno infranto" from Händel's ''[[Giulio Cesare]]''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Its{{Clarify|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--This seems to be referring to improvisation, but that seems contradictory.--&gt; written transmission, along with the veneration bestowed on certain classical works, has led to the expectation that performers will play a work in a way that realizes in detail the original intentions of the composer. During the 19th century the details that composers put in their scores generally increased. Yet the opposite trend—admiration of performers for new "interpretations" of the composer's work—can be seen, and it is not unknown for a composer to praise a performer for achieving a better realization of the original intent than the composer was able to imagine. Thus, classical performers often achieve high reputations for their musicianship, even if they do not compose themselves. Generally however, it is the composers who are remembered more than the performers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The primacy of the composer's written score has also led, today, to a relatively minor role played by improvisation in classical music, in sharp contrast to the practice of musicians who lived during the medieval, renaissance, baroque and early romantic eras. Improvisation in classical music performance was common during both the Baroque and early romantic eras, yet lessened strongly during the second half of the 20th century. During the classical era, Mozart and Beethoven often improvised the cadenzas to their [[piano concerto]]s (and thereby encouraged others to do so), but for violin concertos they provided written cadenzas for use by other soloists.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--The quotation from Maria Callas does not support this claim.--&gt; In opera, the practice of singing strictly by the score, i.e. ''come scritto'', was famously propagated by soprano [[Maria Callas]], who called this practice 'straitjacketing' and implied that it allows the intention of the composer to be understood better, especially during studying the music for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;"In other words, exactly as it's written, nothing more and nothing less, which is what I call straitjacketing." quoted in [[Arianna Huffington|Huffington, Arianna]] (2002). ''Maria Callas: The Woman behind the Legend'', p. 76. Cooper Square. {{ISBN|978-1461624295}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to other music traditions==

===Popular music===
Classical music has often incorporated elements or material from popular music of the composer's time. Examples include occasional music such as Brahms' use of student drinking songs in his ''[[Academic Festival Overture]]'', genres exemplified by [[Kurt Weill]]'s ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', and the influence of jazz on early and mid-20th-century composers including [[Maurice Ravel]], exemplified by the movement entitled "Blues" in his sonata for violin and piano.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Ravel, Maurice, §3: 1918–37|author=Kelly, Barbara L.|access-date=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Postmodern music|postmodern]], [[Minimalist music|minimalist]] and [[Postminimalism|postminimalist]] classical composers acknowledge a debt to popular music.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{GroveOnline|title=Nyman, Michael|author=Siôn, Pwyll Ap|access-date=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}}&lt;!--A single instance cannot verify a broader claim.--&gt;

Numerous examples show influence in the opposite direction, including popular songs based on classical music, the use to which ''[[Pachelbel's Canon#Pachelbel's canon in popular culture|Pachelbel's Canon]]'' has been put since the 1970s, and the musical [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] phenomenon, where classical musicians have achieved success in the popular music arena.&lt;ref&gt;Notable examples are the ''[[Hooked on Classics]]'' series of recordings made by the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] in the early 1980s and the classical crossover violinists [[Vanessa Mae]] and [[Catya Maré]].&lt;/ref&gt; In [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], a number of [[lead guitarist]]s (playing [[electric guitar]]), including [[Ritchie Blackmore]] and [[Randy Rhoads]], modeled their playing styles on Baroque or Classical-era instrumental music.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Folk music===
Composers of classical music have often made use of [[folk music]] (music created by musicians who are commonly not classically trained, often from a purely oral tradition). Some composers, like [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]] and [[Bedřich Smetana|Smetana]],&lt;ref name="Yeomans2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yeomans|first=David|title=Piano Music of the Czech Romantics: A Performer's Guide|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0253218452|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; have used folk themes to impart a nationalist flavor to their work, while others like [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]] have used specific themes lifted whole from their folk-music origins.&lt;ref name="Stevens129"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stevens|first=Haley|author2=Gillies, Malcolm|title=The Life and Music of Béla Bartók|year=1993|isbn=978-0198163497|page=129|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercialization==
Certain staples of classical music are often used commercially (either in advertising or in movie soundtracks). In television commercials, several passages have become [[cliché]]d, particularly the opening of [[Richard Strauss]]' ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' (made famous in the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'') and the opening section "[[O Fortuna]]" of [[Carl Orff]]'s ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]''; other examples include the "[[Dies irae]]" from the [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] [[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]], [[Edvard Grieg]]'s "[[In the Hall of the Mountain King]]" from ''[[Peer Gynt (Grieg)|Peer Gynt]]'', the opening bars of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s "[[Ride of the Valkyries]]" from ''[[Die Walküre]]'', [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s "[[Flight of the Bumblebee]]", and excerpts of [[Aaron Copland]]'s ''[[Rodeo (ballet)|Rodeo]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Several works from the [[Golden age of American animation|Golden Age of Animation]] matched the action to classical music. Notable examples are [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', [[Tom and Jerry]]'s ''[[Johann Mouse]]'', and [[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[Rabbit of Seville]]'' and ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]''

Similarly, movies and television often revert to standard, clichéd excerpts of classical music to convey refinement or opulence: some of the most-often heard pieces in this category include [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]´s [[Cello Suites (Bach)|Cello Suite No. 1]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Eine kleine Nachtmusik]]'', [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]]'s ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|Four Seasons]]'', [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Night on Bald Mountain]]'' (as orchestrated by Rimsky-Korsakov), and [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s "[[William Tell Overture|''William Tell'' Overture]]". The same passages are often used by telephone call centres to induce a sense of calm in customers waiting in a queue.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Shawn Vancour argues that the commercialization of classical music in the early 20th century may have harmed the music industry through inadequate representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vancour|first=Shawn|title=Popularizing the Classics: Radio's Role in the Music Appreciation Movement 1922–34.|journal=Media, Culture and Society|date=March 2009|volume=31|issue=2|page=19|doi=10.1177/0163443708100319|url=http://0-web.ebscohost.com.maurice.bgsu.edu/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;hid=15&amp;sid=44993088-138c-40ef-9fd0-95f42cce6fce%40sessionmgr14&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=a9h&amp;AN=37178702|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the range of production of classical music is from the 14th century to 21st century, most of this music (14th to early 20th century) belongs to the [[public domain]], mainly [[sheet music]] and [[tablature]]s. Some projects like [[Musopen]] and [[Open Goldberg Variations]] were created to produce musical audio files of high quality and release them into the public domain, most of them are available at the [[Internet Archive]] website.

The Open Goldberg Variations project released a [[braille]] format into the public domain that can be used to produce paper or electronic scores, [[Braille e-book]]s, for blind people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengoldbergvariations.org/braille-edition-open-goldberg-variations Braille edition of the Open Goldberg Variations] ny robertDouglass, Open Goldberg Variations, 23 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, several research papers and popular books wrote on what came to be called the "[[Mozart effect]]": an observed temporary, small elevation of scores on certain tests as a result of listening to Mozart's works. The approach has been popularized in a book by Don Campbell, and is based on an experiment published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' suggesting that listening to Mozart temporarily boosted students' [[IQ]] by 8 to 9 points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v400/n6747/abs/400827a0.html Prelude or requiem for the 'Mozart effect'?] ''Nature'' '''400''' (August 26, 1999): 827.&lt;/ref&gt; This popularized version of the theory was expressed succinctly by the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' music columnist [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]]: "researchers... have determined that listening to Mozart actually makes you smarter."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alex Ross (music critic)|Ross, Alex]]. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05EFDF1239F93BA1575BC0A962958260 "Classical View; Listening To Prozac... Er, Mozart"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 28, 1994. Retrieved on May 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Promoters marketed CDs claimed to induce the effect. Florida passed a law requiring toddlers in state-run schools to listen to classical music every day, and in 1998 the governor of Georgia budgeted $105,000 per year to provide every child born in Georgia with a tape or CD of classical music. One of the co-authors of the original studies of the Mozart effect commented "I don't think it can hurt. I'm all for exposing children to wonderful cultural experiences. But I do think the money could be better spent on [[music education]] programs."&lt;ref&gt;Goode, Erica. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E0D81131F930A3575BC0A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=3 "Mozart for Baby? Some Say, Maybe Not"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 3, 1999. Retrieved on May 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996/97, a research study was conducted on a population of preschool through college students in the [[Cherry Creek School District]] in Denver, Colorado, US. The study showed that students who actively listen to classical music before studying had higher academic scores. The research further indicated that students who listened to the music prior to an examination also had positively elevated achievement scores. Students who listened to [[rock-and-roll]] or [[Country music]] had moderately lower scores. The study further indicated that students who used classical music during the course of study had a significant leap in their academic performance; whereas, those who listened to other types of music had significantly lowered academic scores. The research was conducted over several schools within the Cherry Creek School District and was conducted through the [[University of Colorado]]. This study is reflective of several recent studies (i.e. Mike Manthei and Steve N. Kelly of the University of Nebraska at Omaha; Donald A. Hodges and Debra S. O'Connell of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro; etc.) and others{{Full citation needed|date=September 2016}} who had significant results through the [[discourse]] of their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.issaquah.wednet.edu/documents/highschool/Schedule/Arts/Achievement.pdf |title=The Impact of Music Education on Academic Achievement |accessdate=1 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916075557/http://www.issaquah.wednet.edu/documents/highschool/Schedule/Arts/Achievement.pdf |archivedate=September 16, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4787">'''Clinical pastoral education''' (CPE) is [[education]] to teach [[pastoral care]] to [[clergy]] and others. CPE is the primary method of training hospital and hospice [[chaplains]] and spiritual care providers in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt; Cobb, Puchalski and Rumbold (eds.), ''Oxford Textbook of Spirituality in Healthcare'', 2012, p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; CPE is both a [[multicultural]] and [[interfaith]] experience that uses real-life ministry encounters of students to improve the ministry and pastoral care provided by caregivers.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.acpe.edu/faq.htm |title =Frequently Asked Questions about ACPE Clinical Pastoral Education |work =The Association for Clinical Pastoral Education, Inc |at = See section [http://www.acpe.edu/faq.htm#faq1 What is Clinical Pastoral Education?] |accessdate = 2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Theory==
An underpinning theory of education that structures clinical pastoral education is the "[[Reflective Practice|Action-Reflection]]" mode of learning. CPE students typically compose "verbatims" of their pastoral care encounters in which they are invited to reflect upon what occurred and draw insight from these reflections that can be implemented in future pastoral care events.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, Puchalski and Rumbold (eds.), ''Oxford Textbook of Spirituality in Healthcare'', 2012, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Although the practice of pastoral care has a long tradition in Christianity and to some extent in other faith traditions, the systematic analysis of pastoral practice associated with clinical pastoral education had its beginnings in the early 20th century. In 1925, [[Richard Clarke Cabot|Richard Cabot]], a physician and adjunct lecturer at the [[Harvard Divinity School]], published an article in ''[[Survey Graphic]]'' suggesting that every candidate for ministry receive clinical training for pastoral work similar to the clinical training offered to medical students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Stokoe |first=Rodney J.R. |year=2005 |origyear=1974 |title=Clinical Pastoral Education |type=Reprint |journal=The Nova Scotia Medical Bulletin |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=26–28 |issn=0029-5094 |url=http://www.cappe.org/association/download/cpehistory_stokoe.pdf |accessdate=2011-10-20 |format=pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929171141/http://www.cappe.org/association/download/cpehistory_stokoe.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }} The reprint is available as part of the project: {{cite web |url=http://www.cappe.org/mem/index.html |title=Living Human Memories |work=CASC/ACSS The Canadian Association for Spiritual Care |accessdate=2011-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622230836/http://www.cappe.org/mem/index.html |archivedate=2011-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, the Rev. [[Anton Boisen]] placed theological students at the [[Chicago Theological Seminary]] in supervised contact with patients in mental hospitals, a flagship program that later resulted in the forming of the ACPE.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090403034355/http://www.aapc.org/content/brief-history-pastoral-counseling American Association of Pastoral Counselors/History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accrediting bodies==

CPE in Australia and New Zealand is conducted by six CPE accrediting associations that consult together for common curricula and standards of practice under an umbrella association, the Australia New Zealand Association of Clinical Pastoral Education (ANZACPE).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aspea.org.au/anzacpe.php&lt;/ref&gt; The six constituent associations are: [[New South Wales College of Clinical Pastoral Education]] (New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory); Queensland Institute of Clinical Pastoral Education; Association for Supervised Pastoral Education in Australia (Victoria and Tasmania); Association for Clinical Pastoral Education in Western Australia; South Australia and Northern Territory Association for Clinical Pastoral Education; and New Zealand Association for Clinical Pastoral Education.

In the United States, the Association for Clinical Pastoral Education is recognized as an [[education accreditation|accrediting]] organization for CPE programs by the [[U.S. Department of Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg7.html|title =Specialized Accrediting Agencies| publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate = 2013-07-04}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, all CPE training and accreditation is done through [http://www.spiritualcare.ca/ CASC], the Canadian Association of Spiritual Care / Association Canadienne de Soins Spirituels.

[[Image:Diamond Core.jpeg|thumb|right|300px|Rock core samples, the product of a [[Drilling rig#Diamond core drilling|diamond rig]]. A [[pied butcherbird]] perches nearby.]]
A '''core sample''' is a cylindrical section of (usually) a naturally occurring substance. Most core samples are obtained by drilling with special drills into the substance, for example sediment or rock, with a hollow [[steel]] tube called a [[core drill]]. The hole made for the core sample is called the "core bowling". A variety of core samplers exist to sample different media under different conditions. More continue to be invented on a regular basis. In the coring process, the sample is pushed more or less intact into the tube. Removed from the tube in the laboratory, it is inspected and analyzed by different techniques and equipment depending on the type of data desired. 

Core samples can be taken to test the properties of [[manmade]] materials, such as [[concrete]], [[ceramic]]s, some [[metal]]s and alloys, especially the softer ones. Core samples can also be taken of living things, including human beings, especially of a person's bones for microscopic examination to help diagnose diseases.  

== Methods ==
[[Image:Granitic_core_Stillwater.jpg|thumb|60px|Granitic rock core from [[Stillwater igneous complex]], Montana (from a spoil pile).]]
The composition of the subject materials can vary from almost liquid to the strongest materials found in nature or technology, and the location of the subject materials can vary from on the laboratory bench to over 10&amp;nbsp;km from the surface of the Earth in a borehole. The range of equipment and techniques applied to the task is correspondingly great. Core samples are most often taken with their long axis oriented roughly parallel to the axis of a borehole, or parallel to the gravity field for the gravity-driven tools. However it is also possible to take core samples from the wall of an existing borehole. Taking samples from an exposure, albeit an overhanging rock face or on a different planet, is almost trivial. (The Mars Exploration Rovers carry a [[Rock Abrasion Tool]], which is logically equivalent to the "rotary sidewall core" tool described below.)

Some common techniques include:
* ''gravity coring'', in which the core sampler is dropped into the sample, usually the bed of a water body, but essentially the same technique can also be done on soft materials on land. The penetration forces, if recorded, give information about the strength of different depths in the material, which may be the only information required, with samples as an incidental benefit. This technique is common in both civil engineering site investigations (where the techniques tend towards into [[pile driving]]) and geological studies of recent aquatic deposits. The low strength of the materials penetrated means that cores have to be relatively small.
* ''vibracoring'', in which the sampler is vibrated to allow penetration into [[thixotropic]] media. Again, the physical strength of the subject material limits the size of core that can be retrieved.
* ''drilling'' [[exploration diamond drilling]] where a rotating annular tool backed up by a cylindrical core sample storage device is pressed against the subject materials to cut out a cylinder of the subject material. A mechanism is normally needed to retain the cylindrical sample in the coring tool. Depending on circumstances, particularly the consistency and composition of the subject materials, different arrangements may be needed within the core tools to support and protect the sample on its way to surface; it is often also necessary to control or reduce the contact between the [[drilling fluid]] and the core sample, to reduce changes from the coring process. The mechanical forces imposed on the core sample by the tool frequently lead to fracture of the core and loss of less-competent intervals, which can greatly complicate interpretation of the core. Cores can routinely be cut as small as a few [[millimeter]]s in diameter (in wood, for [[dendrochronology]]) up to over 150 millimeters in diameter (routine in [[oil exploration]]). The lengths of samples can range from less than a meter (again, in wood, for [[dendrochronology]]) up to around 200 metres in one run, though 27m to 54m is more usual (in [[oil exploration]]), and many runs can be made in succession if "quick look" analysis in the field suggests that the zone of interest is continuing.
* ''percussion sidewall coring'' uses robust cylindrical "bullets" explosively propelled into the wall of a borehole to retrieve a (relatively) small, short core sample. These tend to be heavily shattered, rendering [[porosity]]/ [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] measurements dubious, but are often sufficient for [[petrography|lithological]] and [[micropaleontology|micropalaeontological]] study. Many samples can be attempted in a single run of the tools, which are typically configured with 20 to 30 "bullets" and propulsive charges along the length of a tool. Several tools can often be ganged together for a single run. The success rates for firing a particular bullet, it penetrating the borehole wall, the retention system recovering the bullet from the borehole wall, and the sample being retained in the bullet are all relatively low, so it is not uncommon for only half the samples attempted to be successful. This is an important consideration in planning sample programmes.
* ''rotary sidewall coring'' where a miniaturised automated rotary drilling tool is applied to the side of the borehole to cut a sample similar in size to a percussion sidewall core (described above). These tend to suffer less deformation than percussion cores. However the core-cutting process takes longer and jams are common in the ancillary equipment which retrieves the sample from the drill bit and stores it within the tool body. This complicates the planning of a coring programme.

==Management of cores and data==
Although often neglected, core samples always degrade to some degree in the process of cutting the core, handling it, and studying it. Non-destructive techniques are increasingly common (e.g. the use of [[MRI]] scanning to characterize grains, pore fluids, pore spaces ([[porosity]]) and their interactions (constituting part of [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]]) but such expensive subtlety is likely wasted on a core that has been shaken on an unsprung lorry for 300&amp;nbsp;km of dirt road.  What happens to cores between the retrieval equipment and the final laboratory (or archive) is an often neglected part of record keeping and core management.

[[File:Cut Bakken Core samples.jpg|thumb|Cut [[Bakken formation|Bakken]] Core samples]]Coring has come to be recognized as an important source of data, and more attention and care is being put on preventing damage to the core during various stages of it transportation and analysis. The usual way to do this is to freeze the core completely using liquid nitrogen, which is cheaply sourced. In some cases, special polymers are also used to preserve and seat/cushion the core from damage.

Equally, a core sample which cannot be related to its context (where it was before it became a core sample) has lost much of its benefit. The identification of the borehole, and the position and orientation ("way up") of the core in the borehole is critical, even if the borehole is in a tree trunk - [[dendrochronology|dendrochronologists]] always try to include a bark surface in their samples so that the date of most-recent growth of the tree can be unambiguously determined.

If these data become separated from core samples, it is generally impossible to regain that data. The cost of a coring operation can vary from a few currency units (for a hand-caught core from a soft soil section) to tens of millions of currency units (for sidewall cores from a remote-area offshore borehole many kilometres deep). Inadequate recording of such basic data has ruined the utility of both types of core.

Different disciplines have different local conventions of recording these data, and the user should familiarize themselves with their area's conventions. For example, in the oil industry, orientation of the core is typically recorded by marking the core with two longitudinal colour streaks, with the red one on the right when the core is being retrieved and marked at surface. Cores cut for mineral mining may have their own, different, conventions. Civil engineering or soil studies may have their own, different, conventions as their materials are often not competent enough to make permanent marks on.

[[File:Bakken Core samples under a black light.jpg|thumb|Bakken Core samples under a black light]]It is becoming increasingly common to retain core samples in cylindrical packaging which forms part of the core-cutting equipment, and to make the marks of record on these "inner barrels" in the field prior to further processing and analysis in the laboratory.  Sometimes core is shipped from the field to the laboratory in as long a length as it comes out of the ground; other times it is cut into standard lengths (5m or 1m or 3&amp;nbsp;ft) for shipping, then reassembled in the laboratory. Some of the "inner barrel" systems are capable of being reversed on the core sample, so that in the laboratory the sample goes "wrong way up" when the core is reassembled. This can complicate interpretation. [[File:Oriented Core Goniometer commonly used when logging core.JPG|thumb|Goniometers are used to measure angles of fractures and other features in a core sample relative to its standard orientation.]]

If the borehole has [[petrophysics|petrophysical]] measurements made of the wall rocks, and these measurements are repeated along the length of the core then the two data sets correlated, one will almost universally find that the depth "of record" for a particular piece of core differs between the two methods of measurement. Which set of measurements to believe then becomes a matter of policy for the client (in an industrial setting) or of great controversy (in a context without an overriding authority. Recording that there are discrepancies, for whatever reason, retains the possibility of correcting an incorrect decision at a later date ; destroying the "incorrect" depth data makes it impossible to correct a mistake later. Any system for retaining and archiving data and core samples needs to be designed so that dissenting opinion like this can be retained.

If core samples from a campaign are competent, it is common practice to "slab" them - cut the sample into two or more samples longitudinally - quite early in laboratory processing so that one set of samples can be archived early in the analysis sequence as a protection against errors in processing. "Slabbing" the core into a 2/3 and a 1/3 set is common. It is also common for one set to be retained by the main customer while the second set goes to the government (who often impose a condition for such donation as a condition of exploration/ exploitation licensing). "Slabbing" also has the benefit of preparing a flat, smooth surface for examination and testing of profile permeability, which is very much easier to work with than the typically rough, curved surface of core samples when they're fresh from the coring equipment. Photography of raw and "slabbed" core surfaces is routine, often under both natural and ultra-violet light.
[[File:Pulling the Bakken Core out of the core barrell.JPG|thumb|Pulling the Bakken Core out of the core barrell]]

A unit of length occasionally used in the literature on seabed cores is ''cmbsf'', an abbreviation for centimeters below sea floor.

==History of coring==
The technique of coring long predates attempts to drill into the [[Earth]]’s [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] by the [[Deep Sea Drilling Program]]. The value to oceanic and other [[geologic history]] of obtaining cores over a wide area of [[sea floor]]s soon became apparent. Core sampling by many scientific and exploratory organizations expanded rapidly. To date hundreds of thousands of core samples have been collected from floors of all the planet’s [[ocean]]s and many of its [[inland water]]s. 
Access to many of these samples is facilitated by the [[Index to Marine &amp; Lacustrine Geological Samples]],
:"A collaboration between twenty institutions and agencies that operate geological repositories."
The above agency keeps a record of the samples held in the repositories of its member organizations. Data includes

[[File:Lower Bakken-3 Forks Transition.JPG|thumb|Lower Bakken-3 Forks Transition]]
==Informational value of core samples==

Coring began as a method of sampling surroundings of ore deposits and oil exploration. It soon expanded to [[ocean]]s, [[lake]]s, [[Ice core|ice]], [[mud]], [[soil]] and [[Dendrochronology|wood]]. Cores on very old [[tree]]s give information about their growth rings without destroying the tree. 

Cores indicate variations of [[climate]], [[species]] and [[sediment]]ary composition during geologic history. The dynamic phenomena of the Earth’s surface are for the most part cyclical in a number of ways, especially [[temperature]] and [[rainfall]].

There are many ways to date a core. Once dated, it gives valuable information about changes of climate and [[terrain]]. For example, cores in the ocean floor, soil and ice have altered the view of the geologic history of the [[Pleistocene]] entirely.

The '''Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science''' ('''DIMACS''') is a collaboration between [[Rutgers University]], [[Princeton University]], and the research firms [[AT&amp;T]], [[Bell Labs]], Applied Communication Sciences, and [[NEC Corporation|NEC]].  It was founded in 1989 with money from the [[National Science Foundation]].  Its offices are located on the Rutgers campus, and 250 members from the six institutions form its permanent members.

DIMACS is devoted to both theoretical development and practical applications of discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science. It engages in a wide variety of evangelism including encouraging, inspiring, and facilitating researchers in these subject areas, and sponsoring conferences and workshops.

Fundamental research in discrete mathematics has applications in diverse fields including Cryptology, Engineering, Networking, and Management Decision Support.

The current director of DIMACS is Rebecca Wright.  Past directors were [[Fred S. Roberts]], [[Daniel Gorenstein]] and [[András Hajnal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.rutgers.edu/docs/history.html A history of mathematics at Rutgers], Charles Weibel.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The DIMACS Challenges==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8182">The term '''"Dialect comedy"''' was coined by David Marc in his essay, ''Origins of the genre''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sitcom Reader, The: America Viewed and Skewed|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=s8ARc_7-NtUC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=David+Marc+origins+of+the+genre&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=A-iN8mGvz1&amp;sig=88fLvYj63QkjEDFx1bh8SxHfrAM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj64dm5k8PJAhXGXD4KHQk0A68Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=David%2520Marc%2520origins%2520of%2520the%2520genre&amp;f=false|publisher = SUNY Press|date = 2012-02-01|isbn = 9780791482636|first = Mary M.|last = Dalton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dialect comedies are a genre of radio (and later television) sitcoms that were popular between the 1920s and the 1950s. They relied on the exaggerated and highly stylized portrayal of stereotypes, usually based on [[ethnic humor]]. The genre has its roots on the vaudeville stage and in the minstrel shows that became popular in the 19th century. The ethnicities of the actual actors portraying the dialects did not have to match the characters; while much Jewish dialect comedy was created and portrayed by actual Jews, other dialect comedies, such as those involving [[blackface]], were often not.

	One of the most notable dialect comedies was [[The Goldbergs (broadcast series)|The Goldbergs]], the brain child of creator/star, [[Gertrude Berg]] about a Jewish family living in the Bronx. After its debut in 1929, the series had several incarnations in radio, television and a musical on Broadway. Berg continued to play the character of Molly Goldberg until 1955. In an article in the May 1936 issue of Radio Mirror, in a piece called ''Ghetto guides the Goldbergs'', writer Dan Wheeler describes Berg’s “double life." Berg, the successful actress and business woman takes the reporter to a Jewish Ghetto on New York’s lower East Side where she spends a few hours a week, Gabbing in Yiddish with the old Yentas of the neighborhood about their children and pouring over the vegetable carts that line the streets. This is her inspiration for her characters; Berg emphasized both realism and being a positive role model in portraying the lead character as a [[Jewish mother stereotype|Jewish mother]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Radio Mirror (May-Oct 1936)|url = https://archive.org/stream/radiomi00macf#page/n155/mode/2up|website = archive.org|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Probably the most enduring program in this genre, [[Amos N Andy]] had two feet planted firmly in the [[Minstrel show|minstrel]] tradition. In 1928, Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll, two white performers took their blackface act, Sam N Henry, which they did not have the rights to and changed it to Amos N Andy, which became one of the most popular shows of the time. In 1948 Variety proclaimed the show “a national habit, almost as familiar as radio itself.”
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Variety (October 1948)|url = https://archive.org/stream/variety172-1948-10#page/n95/mode/2up|website = archive.org|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon transitioning the show to television, Gosden and Correll took on the role of producers and hired a black cast including Alvin Childress (Amos), Spencer Williams (Andy) and Tim Moore (as King Fisher); Gosden and Correll had appeared as their characters in blackface on-screen in the 1930 talkie film ''[[Check and Double Check]]'', which received poor reception.
By the time of its final broadcast in 1960, the show had been renamed Amos N Andy Music Hall.

	[[Life with Luigi]] premiered on CBS in 1948 and centered around Luigi Basco, an Italian immigrant living in Chicago. Many of the plots were either about Luigi attending “citizenship classes” and the wacky immigrants he meets there or about his cranky landlord trying to convince Luigi to marry his overweight daughter. The TV version premiered in 1952 and was cancelled shortly after. It was cancelled due to the bumbling helpless portrayal of a character often referred to as “the little immigrant” who didn’t understand how banks work even though there are probably banks in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = St. Petersburg Times - Google News Archive Search|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=19521004&amp;id=FQ4kAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Kk8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5001,1528184&amp;hl=en|website = news.google.com|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:J. Carrol Naish Life With Luigi 1950.JPG|thumb|J. Carrol Naish in Life With Luigi 1950]]
[[Mama (TV series)|Mama]] (alternately “I Remember Mama”) was a series about a Norwegian family living in San Francisco, CA starring Peggy Wood, Judson Laire and Rosemary Rice.

''[[Beulah (series)|Beulah]]'' was a radio series on CBS from 1945–1954 and a TV show on ABC from 1950-1952. It was the first series to feature an African American woman in the main role. Beulah drew much of the same criticism from the black community as Amos N Andy. The show was criticized for its portrayal of the “[[Mammy archetype|Mammy]]” or the happy go lucky black servant who wanted nothing more from life than to serve white folks. When it first hit the radio waves, the character of Beulah was voiced by her creator, [[Marlin Hurt]], a white male; the character was originally introduced nationwide as a supporting character on ''[[Fibber McGee and Molly]]'' before getting her own show. After Hurt's unexpected death in 1946, the character of Beulah was played by Bob Corley, another white man. In 1947, African American actress Hattie McDaniel took over, followed by two beautiful African American sisters Lillian Randolph and later Amanda Randolph. The TV version of Beulah was portrayed by Ethel Waters and Louise Beavers.

	Jewish performers such as [[George Burns]], [[Jack Benny]] and [[Milton Berle]] had shows that were arguably forms of dialect comedy. Each of these comedians used cultural markers of Jewishness such as incorporating [[Yiddish]] words and phrases into their dialogue and referencing places that were known for being Jewish neighborhoods such as New York’s East side. Comedians like Berle and others had come out of the same vaudeville tradition as the minstrel performers and as such did their shows in a classic variety format which included characters who were often based on racial and ethnic stereotypes. As late as the 1990s, the work of [[Jerry Seinfeld]] was seen as having a distinctly New York Jewish flavor to it, which initially hindered his show ''[[Seinfeld]]'' (which later became a smash hit) from being picked up as a series.&lt;ref name=SeinfeldMemo&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Seinfeld-Research-Memo-1083639.aspx|work=[[TV Guide]]|author=Battaglio, Stephen|date=June 27, 2014|title=On ''Seinfeld's'' 25th anniversary an exclusive look at the memo that almost killed the show|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often overlooked in modern times were regional dialects that were not directly based on ethnic humor. [[Hillbilly]] humor was a somewhat common form of dialect comedy during the radio era, with shows such as ''[[Lum and Abner]]'' using the genre to full effect. Southerners (especially haughty aristocrats from the South and their distinctive accents) were another target of dialect comedy, with one of the most famous examples being fictional U.S. Senator [[Senator Claghorn|Beauregard Claghorn]] from ''[[Town Hall Tonight|The Fred Allen Show]]''.

Occasional use of dialect comedy continued even after [[political correctness]] led to the dramatic decline of its usage in the 1950s. [[José Jiménez (character)|José Jiménez]], a fictional Bolivian immigrant who was created by non-Hispanic comedian [[Bill Dana]], remained popular as a guest act well into the 1960s; Dana never intended the character to be offensive and [[kill off|killed him off]] in the late 1970s, complete with a mock funeral. The 1980s sitcom ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' included Swedish dialect humor in the form of [[Betty White]]'s [[Rose Nylund]] character, who fit early 20th-century stereotypes of the good-hearted but dense Swede.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13860">The '''double diversion''' is two-part theory about environmental harm that was developed by [[William Freudenburg]] and colleagues beginning in the 1990s, and focusing on "disproportionality" and "distraction."  The concept of disproportionality involves the observation that, rather than being a reflection of overall levels of [[economic activity]], the majority of [[environmental destruction]] is actually due to a relatively small number of economic actors, which enjoy privileged access to [[natural resource]]s, “diverting” those resources for the private benefit of the few.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freudenburg's original work on this concept was carried out in conjunction with his colleague from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Peter Nowak.  The reference to the "double" diversion reflects the argument that this first diversion is made possible in large part by the second—the diversion of attention, or distraction, often ironically relying on the widespread but empirically inaccurate belief that environmental harm is economically beneficial to the population as a whole.

== Historical emphasis on individual factors ==
The double diversion differs from previous theories about responsibility for environmental harm, which tend to focus on overall or average levels of environmental harm.  The most notable example is [[Garret Hardin]]’s 1968 article ''[[The Tragedy of the Commons]]'', which focuses on the conflict between individual self-interest and what benefits the society as a whole.  Hardin illustrates this concept through an example of [[herder]]s sharing an open stretch of [[Arable land|farmland]], which results in each individual developing an incentive to increase his individual number of [[cow]]s.  Hardin argued that as a result, all of the individual herders ignore long-term benefits that result from environmental [[environmental protection|conservation]], resulting in “individual [[rationality]] leading to a collective tragedy”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hardin|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tendency to focus on overall impacts continued into the 1970s and 1980s with the development of the [[I&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;PAT]] equation by [[Barry Commoner]], [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] and [[John Holdren]].  The formula states that human impact on the environmental equals the product of population, affluence, and technology,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ehrlich|Holdren|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; without considering that all individuals do not have equal environmental impacts.  This is similarly true in the case of [[William R. Catton, Jr.|William Catton]]’s 1980 book ''Overshoot: the Ecological Basis of Revolutionary Change'', in which Catton emphasizes the argument that all of us have lifestyles that are based upon a time when our [[carrying capacity]] exceeded human load.  He argues that because we have been unwilling to modify our lifestyles as carrying capacities have been exceeded, subsequent generations are destined to inherit a world of increasing conflict for finite resources &lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Catton|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also integral to the individual-emphasis from the writing of this period is the notion of the conflict between economic protection and [[economic growth]].  The typical feeling of this period is articulated through O’Connor (1988, 1991), who sees [[capitalism]] as relying on prosperity for the legitimization of economic expansion.  What occurs as a result, according to O’Connor, is an ever-increasing exploitation of both the environment and workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Berry|2008|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disproportionality and distraction ==
According to the double diversion hypothesis, the emphasis on overall or average levels of individual impacts, which many 20th century authors stressed, ultimately missed the importance of the disproportionate impacts that economic outliers can have on the environment.  According to [[Lisa Berry]], “For societies where a small fraction of the population consumes many more resources or produces much more [[pollution]] than other members, the I&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;PAT model fails to communicate the vast differences in resource consumption that exist within groups.” &lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Berry|2008|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvp|Freudenburg|2006}} traces this emphasis to the fact that most scientists are trained to focus on statistical means.  However, according to the double diversion hypothesis, rather than being discarded, the extreme cases need to be the focus of the debate.

When this privileged access is threatened, according to Freudenburg, organized producers use distraction, through privileged accounts” largely unchallenged stories and beliefs that divert attention away from their patterns of research use.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These privileged accounts ultimately get repeated so often that they ultimately become “embedded” within our language and thought. If the opposition is still refuses to stay silent and challenges them on their inequitable effects on the environment they engage in a disappearing act, where they do not “respond” why their company has the right enjoy profits of a public good, but instead point to the benefits that the populace supposedly receives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, when laws and policies are created, organized interests can expect to receive tangible rewards from the political system, while the remainder of the citizenry can expect to receive mainly symbolic rewards in the form of rhetoric.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Double diversion in practice==
The double diversion is a sufficiently new theory for it to not have been tested extensively, but several notable studies suggest that it deserves greater attention. Although no notable counter-examples have yet been provided, their existence is entirely possible.

==In agriculture==
A case study of disproportionality in [[agriculture]] is provided by [[Peter Nowak]] and colleagues, who researched the agricultural practices of several thousand farmers in [[Wisconsin]]. They discuss how the trend of subsistence farms developing into livestock ranches, where the reuse of manure is discouraged, has increased disproportionality of negative environmental practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nowak|Bowen|Cabot|2005|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowak ''et al.'' found that a small number of farmers using non-normative practices had a significantly greater responsibility for environmental damage.  This was true regarding the amount of [[fertilizer]] used, the degree of erosion from the production of croplands, and the amount of [[phosphorus]] that accumulated in watersheds.  The majority of the soil test results are in the high or excessively high range for phosphorus values, with a clear sub-set of outliers that have values up to 900% above the sample mean.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nowak|Bowen|Cabot|2005|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because environmental regulations were crafted for the “average” rather than the exceptional farms, the policies did little to curb the runoff from the few farms that created significantly more than “their share” of the phosphorus problem. Nowak et al. concludes that “we are suggesting that indicators of environmental degradation in this situation […] failed to decrease during the 1976–1994 period because of the increasing important of disproportionate contributions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nowak|Bowen|Cabot|2005|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;   	
Disproportionality in agriculture has also been observed in water use, with farmers and organized farm interests in dry western states of the U.S. commonly using 80&amp;nbsp;percent of those state’s water, while only having an economic relevance of 1–3&amp;nbsp;percent of the total economy.&lt;ref name="Freudenburg_2006_15"&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This disproportionate effect signifies that twenty thousand times as many jobs would be created if this same amount of water was used in industry.  Nevertheless, the top four percent of all farmers received 55&amp;nbsp;percent of all federal [[crop subsidies]], with this trend of this disproportionality increasing into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reluctance to challenge this status quo can be explained through diversion via the [[Social Multiplier Effect|social multiplier effect]]: even if a given individual does not work in a given industry, that person’s attitudes may be affected by whether his or her friends and relatives do.  Therefore, it makes sense that rural resident would be especially reluctant to criticize the industries or facilities they see as providing jobs for their friends and neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In industry==
Disproportionate effects have also been observed within the [[industry|industrial]] setting in cases of both between and within-group comparisons. These inequalities can be measured using the [[Gini coefficient]], (which ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher number signifying greater inequality.) {{harvp|Freudenburg|2006}} uses this coefficient to establish both between and in-group comparisons of industry toxicity, finding that chemical companies had a level 0.865 in comparison to other industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in-group disproportionality between individual chemical companies was even more substantial, with the 62 chemical company facilities he analyzed producing a Gini coefficient of 0.975. These results are consistent with the [[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test]], which finds that expectations for proportionate relationships between economic activity and environmental harm can consistently be rejected at very high levels of significance.&lt;ref name="Freudenburg_2006_15"/&gt;

==Automobile pollution==
Disproportionality has also been observed by [[A. Kurniawan]] and [[A. Schmidt-Ott]], who developed a new sensing method in order to measure emissions of individual cars.  As in previous studies by [[Beaton (scientist)|Beaton]] ''et al.'' (1995) and [[Bishop &amp; Stedman]], (1996) they found that contrary to popular belief, a small group of “super polluters” is actually responsible for a disproportionate amount of total emissions.  In this particular study, Kurniawan ''et al.'' found that 5&amp;nbsp;percent of the total vehicles accounted for 43&amp;nbsp;percent of emissions.&lt;ref name="Kurniawan_1"&gt;{{harvp|Kurniawan|Schmidt-Ott|2006|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From these findings, they conclude that “properly maintained vehicles of any age are relatively small contributors to exhaust pollution and that most of the pollution is cause by a small percentage of badly maintained cars.”&lt;ref name="Kurniawan_1"/&gt; Given these results, they suggest that unlike the current policies of most industrialized countries, the best solution is a targeted repair program that focuses on disproportionate polluters.  The benefits of such a policy is demonstrated through are demonstrated by Netherlands where it has been implemented, and the contribution of super-polluters has been greatly diminished.  Nonetheless, the failure of other countries to follow their lead has meant that “about half of the present particulate pollution by passenger cars would be avoidable if adequate monitoring would enable enforcement of existing laws”&lt;ref name="Kurniawan_1"/&gt;

==Multimedia instructional design principles==

Beginning with [[Cognitive load|cognitive load theory]] as their motivating scientific premise, researchers such as [[Richard E. Mayer]], [[John Sweller]], and Roxana Moreno established within the scientific literature a set of multimedia instructional design principles that promote effective learning.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R. E., &amp; Moreno, R., "Nine ways to reduce cognitive load in multimedia learning." Educational psychologist, 38(1), 43-52, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moreno, R., &amp; Mayer, R, "Interactive multimodal learning environments." Educational Psychology Review, 19(3), 309-326, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, R. C., Nguyen, F., &amp; Sweller, J., "Efficiency in learning: Evidence-based guidelines to manage cognitive load." John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these principles have been "field tested" in everyday learning settings and found to be effective there as well.&lt;ref&gt;Harskamp, E. G., Mayer, R. E., &amp; Suhre, C., "Does the modality principle for multimedia learning apply to science classrooms?" Learning and Instruction, 17(5), 465-477, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chang, C. C., &amp; Yang, F. Y., "Exploring the cognitive loads of high-school students as they learn concepts in web-based environments," Computers &amp; Education, 55(2), 673-680, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Issa, N., Mayer, R. E., Schuller, M., Wang, E., Shapiro, M. B., &amp; DaRosa, D. A., "Teaching for understanding in medical classrooms using multimedia design principles," Medical education, 47(4), 388-396, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of this body of research has been performed using university students given relatively short lessons on technical concepts with which they held low prior knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=Visual feasts of the mind: matching how we teach to how we learn {{!}} David Roberts {{!}} TEDxLoughboroughU|date=2016-12-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJyhTg26w-A&amp;index=5&amp;list=PLoI1XyYg-D9WW51FPWUWLi4ZEp_mVZv5c|accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, David Roberts has tested the method with students in nine social science disciplines including sociology, politics and business studies. His longitudinal research programme over 3 years established a clear improvement in levels of student engagement and in the development of active learning principles among students exposed to a combination of images and text, over students exposed only to text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://inspiringsocsci.pressbooks.com/chapter/life-after-death-by-powerpoint/|title=Life after Death by PowerPoint {{!}} Inspire – teaching and learning in the Social Sciences|website=inspiringsocsci.pressbooks.com|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other studies have shown these principles to be effective with learners of other ages and with non-technical learning content.&lt;ref&gt;Mousavi, S. Y., Low, R., &amp; Sweller, J., "Reducing cognitive load by mixing auditory and visual presentation modes," Journal of educational psychology, 87(2), 319, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerven, P. W., Paas, F., Merriënboer, J. J., Hendriks, M., &amp; Schmidt, H. G., "The efficiency of multimedia learning into old age," British Journal of Educational Psychology, 73(4), 489-505, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Research using learners who have greater prior knowledge in the lesson material sometimes finds results that contradict these design principles. This has led some researchers to put forward the "expertise effect" as an instructional design principle unto itself.&lt;ref&gt;Spanjers, I. A. E., Wouters, P., Van Gog, T., &amp; Van Merriënboer, J. J. G., "An expertise reversal effect of segmentation in learning from animations," Computers in Human Behavior, 27, 46-52, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spanjers, I. A., Wouters, P., Van Gog, T., &amp; Van Merrienboer, J. J., "An expertise reversal effect of segmentation in learning from animated worked-out examples," Computers in Human Behavior, 27(1), 46-52, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blayney, P., Kalyuga, S., &amp; Sweller, J. "Interactions between the isolated–interactive elements effect and levels of learner expertise: Experimental evidence from an accountancy class," Instructional Science, 38(3), 277-287, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kalyuga, S., Chandler, P., &amp; Sweller, J., "Incorporating learner experience into the design of multimedia instruction," Journal of Educational Psychology, 92, 126–136, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The underlying theoretical premise, cognitive load theory, describes the amount of mental effort that is related to performing a task as falling into one of three categories: germane, intrinsic, and extraneous.&lt;ref&gt;Sweller, J (June 1988). "Cognitive load during problem solving: Effects on learning". Cognitive Science 12 (2): 257–285.&lt;/ref&gt; Germane cognitive load is the mental effort required to process the task's information, make sense of it, and access and/or store it in long-term memory (for example, seeing a math problem, identifying the values and operations involved, and understanding that your task is to solve the math problem). Intrinsic cognitive load is the mental effort required to perform the task itself (for example, actually solving the math problem). Extraneous cognitive load is the mental effort imposed by the way that the task is delivered, which may or may not be efficient (for example, finding the math problem you are supposed to solve on a page that also contains advertisements for books about math).

The multimedia instructional design principles identified by Mayer, Sweller, Moreno, and their colleagues are largely focused on minimizing extraneous cognitive load and managing intrinsic and germane loads at levels that are appropriate for the learner. Examples of these principles in practice include 
* Reducing extraneous load by eliminating visual and auditory effects and elements that are not central to the lesson, such as [[seductive details]] (the coherence principle)&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R.E., Bove, W., Bryman, A., Mars, R., &amp; Tapangco, L., "When less is more: Meaningful learning from visual and verbal summaries of science textbook lessons." Journal of Educational Psychology, 88, 64–73, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harp, S.F., &amp; Mayer, R.E. "How seductive details do their damage: A theory of cognitive interest in science learning." Journal of Educational Psychology, 90, 414–434, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reducing germane load by delivering verbal information through audio presentation (narration) while delivering relevant visual information through static images or animations (the modality principle)&lt;ref&gt;Mousavi, S. Y., Low, R., &amp; Sweller, J., "Reducing cognitive load by mixing auditory and visual presentation modes." Journal of educational psychology, 87(2), 319, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R.E., &amp; Moreno, R., "A split-attention effect in multimedia learning: Evidence for dual coding hypothesis." Journal of Educational Psychology, 83, 484–490, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Controlling intrinsic load by breaking the lesson into smaller segments and giving learners control over the pace at which they move forward through the lesson material (the segmenting principle).&lt;ref name="Moreno, R. 2007"&gt;Moreno, R., "Optimizing learning from animations by minimizing cognitive load: Cognitive and affective consequences of signaling and segmentation methods." Applied Cognitive Psychology, 21, 765–781, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spanjers, I. A., van Gog, T., Wouters, P., &amp; van Merriënboer, J. J., "Explaining the segmentation effect in learning from animations: The role of pausing and temporal cueing." Computers &amp; Education, 59(2), 274-280, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Florax, M., &amp; Ploetzner, R., "What contributes to the split-attention effect? Role of text segmentation, picture labeling, and spatial proximity." Learning and Instruction, 20, 216–224, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive load theory (and by extension many of the multimedia instructional design principles) is based in part on a model of [[working memory]] by [[Alan Baddeley]] and [[Graham Hitch]] who proposed that working memory has two largely independent, limited capacity sub-components that tend to work in parallel – one visual and one verbal/acoustic.&lt;ref name="Baddeley" /&gt; This gave rise to [[dual-coding theory]], first proposed by [[Allan Paivio]] and later applied to multimedia learning by [[Richard E. Mayer|Richard Mayer]]. According to Mayer,&lt;ref name=Mayer2001 /&gt; separate channels of working memory process auditory and visual information during any lesson. Consequently, a learner can use more cognitive processing capacities to study materials that combine auditory verbal information with visual graphical information than to process materials that combine printed (visual) text with visual graphical information. In other words, the multi-modal materials reduce the cognitive load imposed on working memory.

In a series of studies, Mayer and his colleagues tested Paivio's [[dual-coding theory]], with multimedia lesson materials. They repeatedly found that students given multimedia with animation and narration consistently did better on transfer questions than those who learn from animation and text-based materials. That is, they were significantly better when it came to applying what they had learned after receiving multimedia rather than mono-media (visual only) instruction. These results were then later confirmed by other groups of researchers.

The initial studies of multimedia learning were limited to logical scientific processes that centered on cause-and-effect systems like automobile braking systems, how a bicycle pump works or cloud formation. However, subsequent investigations found that the [[modality effect]] extended to other areas of learning.

===Empirically established principles===
* '''Multimedia principle:''' Deeper learning is observed when words and relevant graphics are both presented than when words are presented alone (also called the multimedia effect).&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Ruth C.|last2=Mayer|first2=Richard E.|title=E-learning and the science of instruction: Proven guidelines for consumers and designers of multimedia learning.|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, the three most common elements in multimedia presentations are relevant graphics, audio narration, and explanatory text. Combining any two of these three elements works better than using just one or all three.
* '''Modality principle:'''  native speakers of the narration language, or when only printed words appear on the screen.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt; Generally speaking, audio narration leads to better learning than the same words presented as text on the screen. This is especially true for walking someone through graphics on the screen, and when the material to be learned is complex or the terminology being used is already understood by the student (otherwise see "pre-training"). One exception to this is when the learner will be using the information as a reference and will need to look back to it again and again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic principles for online and multimedia learning|url=http://www.edgurus.com/the-basics.html|website=www.edgurus.com|publisher=EdGurus.com|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Coherence principle:''' Avoid using unnecessary content (irrelevant video, graphics, music, stories, narration, etc.) in order to minimize cognitive load imposed on memory during learning by irrelevant and possibly distracting content.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt; Basically, the less learners know about the lesson content, the easier it is for them to get distracted by anything shown that is not directly relevant to the lesson. For learners with greater prior knowledge, however, some motivational imagery may increase their interest and learning effectiveness just a bit.&lt;ref&gt;Park, B., Moreno, R., Seufert, T., &amp; Brü., "Does cognitive load moderate the seductive details effect? A multimedia study." Computers in Human Behavior, 27(1), 5-10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magner, U. I., Schwonke, R., Aleven, V., Popescu, O., &amp; Renkl, A., "Triggering situational interest by decorative illustrations both fosters and hinders learning in computer-based learning environments." Learning and Instruction, 29, 141-152, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Contiguity principle:''' Keep related pieces of information together. Deeper learning occurs when relevant text (for example, a label) is placed close to graphics or when spoken words and graphics are presented at the same time, or when feedback is presented next to the answer given by the learner.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt;
* '''Segmenting principle:''' Deeper learning occurs when content is broken into small chunks.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt; Break down long lessons into several shorter lessons.  Break down long text passages into multiple shorter ones.
* '''Signalling principle:''' The use of visual, auditory, or temporal cues to draw attention to critical elements of the lesson. Common techniques include arrows, circles, highlighting or bolding text, and pausing or vocal emphasis in narration.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crooks, S. M., Cheon, J., Inan, F., Ari, F., &amp; Flores, R. "Modality and cueing in multimedia learning: Examining cognitive and perceptual explanations for the modality effect." Computers in Human Behavior, 28(3), 1063-1071, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Ending lesson segments after the critical information has been given may also serve as a signalling cue.&lt;ref&gt;Ibrahim, M., Antonenko, P. D., Greenwood, C. M., &amp; Wheeler, D. "Effects of segmenting, signalling, and weeding on learning from educational video." Learning, Media and Technology, 37(3), 220-235, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Learner control principle: ''' Deeper learning occurs when learners can control the rate at which they move forward through segmented content.&lt;ref name="Moreno, R. 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hasler, B. S., Kersten, B., &amp; Sweller, J., "Learner control, cognitive load and instructional animation." Applied cognitive psychology, 21(6), 713-729, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Savoji 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savoji|first1=A.P.|last2=Hassanabadi|first2=H.|last3=Fasihipour|first3=Z.|title=The modality effect in learner-paced multimedia learning.|journal=Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences|date=2011|volume=30|pages=1488–1493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learners tend to do best when the narration stops after a short, meaningful segment of content is given and the learner has to click a "continue" button in order to start the next segment. Some research suggests not overwhelming the learner with too many control options, however. Giving just pause and play buttons may work better than giving pause, play, fast forward, reverse buttons.&lt;ref name="Savoji 2011" /&gt; Also, high prior-knowledge learners may learn better when the lesson moves forward automatically, but they have a pause button that allows them to stop when they choose to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Khacharem, A., Spanjers, I. A., Zoudji, B., Kalyuga, S., &amp; Ripoll, H., "Using segmentation to support the learning from animated soccer scenes: An effect of prior knowledge." Psychology of Sport and Exercise, 14(2), 154-160, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spanjers, I. A., Wouters, P., Van Gog, T., &amp; Van Merrienboer, J. J., "An expertise reversal effect of segmentation in learning from animated worked-out examples." Computers in Human Behavior, 27(1), 46-52, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hatsidimitris, G., &amp; Kalyuga, S., "Guided self-management of transient information in animations through pacing and sequencing strategies." Educational Technology Research and Development, 61(1), 91-105, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Personalization principle:''' Deeper learning in multimedia lessons occur when learners experience a stronger social presence, as when a conversational script or learning agents are used.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt; The effect is best seen when the tone of voice is casual, informal, and in a 1st person ("I" or "we") or 2nd person ("you") voice.&lt;ref&gt;Kartal, G., "Does language matter in multimedia learning? Personalization principle revisited." Journal of Educational Psychology, 102(3), 615, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, of the following two sentences, the second version conveys more of a casual, informal, conversational tone: 
::A. The learner should have the sense that someone is talking directly to them when they hear the narration.
::B. Your learner should feel like someone is talking directly to them when they hear your narration.
:Also, research suggests that using a polite tone of voice ("You may want to try multiplying both sides of the equation by 10.") leads to deeper learning for low prior knowledge learners than does a less polite, more directive tone of voice ("Multiply both sides of the equation by 10."), but may impair deeper learning in high prior knowledge learners.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, N., Johnson, W. L., Mayer, R. E., Rizzo, P., Shaw, E., &amp; Collins, H., "The politeness effect: Pedagogical agents and learning outcomes." International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 66(2), 98-112, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLaren, B.M., DeLeeuw, K.E., &amp; Mayer, R.E. (2011). A politeness effect in learning with web-based intelligent tutors. International Journal of Human Computer Studies, 69, 70–79, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, adding pedagogical agents (computer characters) can help if used to reinforce important content. For example, have the character narrate the lesson, point out critical features in on-screen graphics, or visually demonstrate concepts to the learner.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R.E., Dow, G., &amp; Mayer, S., "Multimedia learning in an interactive self-explaining environment: What works in the design of agent-based microworlds?" Journal of Educational Psychology, 95, 806–813, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moreno, R., Mayer, R.E., Spires, H., &amp; Lester, J., "The case for social agency in computer-based teaching: Do students learn more deeply when they interact with animated pedagogical agents?" Cognition and Instruction, 19, 177–214, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, R.K. (2002). Optimizing learning from examples using animated pedagogical agents. Journal of Educational Psychology, 94, 416–427, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R. E., &amp; DaPra, C. S., "An embodiment effect in computer-based learning with animated pedagogical agents." Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 18(3), 239, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moreno, R., Reislein, M., &amp; Ozogul, G., "Using virtual peers to guide visual attention during learning." Journal of Media Psychology: Theories, Methods, and Applications, 22(2), 52-60, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Pre-training principle:''' Deeper learning occurs when lessons present key concepts or vocabulary prior to presenting the processes or procedures related to those concepts.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt; According to Mayer, Mathias, and Wetzel,&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R.E., Mathias, A., &amp; Wetzell, K., "Fostering understanding of multimedia messages through pretraining: Evidence for a two-stage theory of mental model construction." Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 8, 147–154, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; "Before presenting a multimedia explanation, make sure learners visually recognize each major component, can name each component and can describe the major state changes of each component. In short, make sure learners build component models before presenting a cause-and-effect explanation of how a system works." However, others have noted that including pre-training content appears to be more important for low prior knowledge learners than for high prior knowledge learners.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, E., Chandler, P., &amp; Sweller, J., "Assimilating complex information." Learning and Instruction, 12, 61–86, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, P., "Impact of reducing intrinsic cognitive load on learning in a mathematical domain." Applied Cognitive Psychology, 20(3), 287-298, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, T., Ayres, P., &amp; Sweller, J., "The impact of sequencing and prior knowledge on learning mathematics through spreadsheet applications." Educational Technology Research and Development, 53(3), 15-24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Redundancy principle:''' Deeper learning occurs when lesson graphics are explained by audio narration alone rather than audio narration and on-screen text.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt; This effect is stronger when the lesson is fast-paced and the words are familiar to the learners. Exceptions to this principle include: screens with no visuals, learners who are not native speakers of the course language, and placement of only a few key words on the screen (i.e., labelling critical elements of the graphic image).&lt;ref&gt;Moreno, R., &amp; Mayer, R.E., "Verbal redundancy in multimedia learning: When reading helps listening." Journal of Educational Psychology, 94, 156–163, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scheiter, K., Schüler, A., Gerjets, P., Huk, T., &amp; Hesse, F. W., "Extending multimedia research: How do prerequisite knowledge and reading comprehension affect learning from text and pictures." Computers in Human Behavior, 31, 73-84, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, P., &amp; Sweller, J., "Cognitive load theory and the format of instruction." Cognition and Instruction, 8, 293-332, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Expertise effect:''' Instructional methods, such as those described above, that are helpful to domain novices or low prior knowledge learners may have no effect or may even depress learning in high prior knowledge learners.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kalyuga, S., Chandler, P., &amp; Sweller, J. "Incorporating learner experience into the design of multimedia instruction." Journal of Educational Psychology, 92, 126–136, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLaren, B.M., DeLeeuw, K.E., &amp; Mayer, R.E. "A politeness effect in learning with web-based intelligent tutors." International Journal of Human Computer Studies, 69, 70–79, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magner, U. I., Schwonke, R., Aleven, V., Popescu, O., &amp; Renkl, A. "Triggering situational interest by decorative illustrations both fosters and hinders learning in computer-based learning environments." Learning and Instruction, 29, 141-152, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such principles may not apply outside of laboratory conditions. For example, Muller found that adding approximately 50% additional extraneous but interesting material did not result in any significant difference in learner performance.&lt;ref name="Muller2008" /&gt; There is ongoing debate concerning the mechanisms underlying these beneficial principles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tabbers, Martens, Merriënboer|title=The modality effect in multimedia instructions|url=http://ou.nl/Docs/Expertise/OTEC/Publicaties/huib%20tabbers/Cognitive%20Science%202001%20Huib%20Tabbers.pdf|publisher=[[Open University of the Netherlands]]|accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on what [[Boundary critique|boundary]] conditions may apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reinwein|title=Does the Modality Effect Exist? and if So, Which Modality Effect?|journal=Journal of Psycholinguistic Research|year=2012|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/w155x19117733217/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Learning theories==

{{Main article|Learning theory (education)}}

Good pedagogical practice has a theory of learning at its core. However, no single best-practice [[e-learning]] standard has emerged. This may be unlikely given the range of learning and teaching styles, the potential ways technology can be implemented and the ways in which [[educational technology]] itself is changing.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith, S. and B. Newton (2003). "Models of eLearning: Technology Promise vs Learner Needs Literature Review." The International Journal of Management Education 3(3).&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[pedagogical]] approaches or [[learning theories]] may be considered in designing and interacting with [[e-learning]] programs.

'''Social-[[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]]'''&amp;nbsp;– this pedagogy is particularly well afforded by the use of discussion forums, blogs, wiki and online collaborative activities. It is a collaborative approach that opens educational content creation to a wider group including the students themselves. The [[One Laptop Per Child|One Laptop Per Child Foundation]] attempted to use a constructivist approach in its project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Constructivism Wiki.Laptop.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laurillard's conversational model'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~rjr/dolweb/docs/laurillardmoddoc.htm Informal description of Laurillard's Model]&lt;/ref&gt; is also particularly relevant to eLearning, and [[Gilly Salmon]]'s Five-Stage Model is a pedagogical approach to the use of discussion boards.&lt;ref&gt;E-moderating: The Key to Teaching and Learning Online&amp;nbsp;– Gilly Salmon, Kogan Page, 2000, {{ISBN|0-7494-4085-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cognitive perspective''' focuses on the cognitive processes involved in learning as well as how the brain works.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B. S., and D. R. Krathwohl. (1956). Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: Handbook 1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emotional perspective''' focuses on the emotional aspects of learning, like motivation, engagement, fun, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Bååth, J. A. (1982) "Distance Students' Learning&amp;nbsp;– Empirical Findings and Theoretical Deliberations"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Behavioural perspective''' focuses on the skills and behavioural outcomes of the learning process. Role-playing and application to on-the-job settings.&lt;ref&gt;Areskog, N-H. (1995) The Tutorial Process&amp;nbsp;– the Roles of Student Teacher and Tutor in a Long Term Perspective&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contextual perspective''' focuses on the environmental and social aspects which can stimulate learning. Interaction with other people, collaborative discovery and the importance of peer support as well as pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Black, J. &amp; McClintock, R. (1995) "An Interpretation Construction Approach to Constructivist Design."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mode neutral''' Convergence or promotion of ‘transmodal’ learning where online and classroom learners can coexist within one learning environment thus encouraging interconnectivity and the harnessing of collective intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Smith B, Reed P &amp; Jones C (2008)  ‘Mode Neutral’ pedagogy. European Journal of Open, Distance and E-learning."&lt;/ref&gt;

For many theorists, it’s the interaction between student and teacher and student and student in the online environment that enhances learning (Mayes and de Freitas 2004). Pask’s theory that learning occurs through conversations about a subject which in turn helps to make knowledge explicit has an obvious application to learning within a  [[Virtual learning environment|VLE]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen, I. E., J. Seaman, et al. (2007). Blending In: The Extent and Promise of Blended Education in the United States. Needham, M.A., The Sloan Consortium.&lt;/ref&gt;

Salmon developed a five-stage model of e-learning and e-moderating that for some time has had a major influence where online courses and online discussion forums have been used.&lt;ref name="Salmon2005"&gt;Salmon, G. (2005). E-moderating, the key to teaching and learning online. Routledge Falmer.&lt;/ref&gt; In her five-stage model, individual access and the ability of students to use the technology are the first steps to involvement and achievement. The second step involves students creating an identity online and finding others with whom to interact; online socialisation is a critical element of the e-learning process in this model. In step 3 students are giving and sharing information relevant to the course to each other. Collaborative interaction amongst students is central to step 4. The fifth step in Salmon’s model involves students looking for benefits from the system and using resources from outside of it to deepen their learning. Throughout all of this, the tutor/teacher/lecturer fulfils the role of moderator or e-moderator, acting as a facilitator of student learning.

Some criticism is now beginning to emerge. Her model does not easily transfer to other contexts (she developed it with experience from an Open University distance learning course). It ignores the variety of learning approaches that are possible within computer mediated communication (CMC) and the range of learning theories that are available (Moule 2007).

===Self-regulation===
[[Self-regulated learning]] refers to several concepts that play major roles in learning, and which have significant relevance in e-learning. Zimmerman (1998){{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;!--recently added "citation" without adequate specifics; is this a reference that's being taken from the Peter Williams book, right below? --&gt; explains that in order to develop self-regulation, learning courses should offer opportunities for students to practice strategies and skills by themselves. Self-regulation is also strongly related to a student's social sources such as parents and teachers. Moreover, Steinberg (1996) found that high-achieving students usually have high-expectation parents who monitor their children closely.&lt;ref name="Williams2004"&gt;Peter E. Williams and Chan M. Hllman(Feb.,2004). Differences in self-regulation for online learning between first-and second-generation college students.''Research in Higher Education'', Vol. 45, No.1, pp. 71-82.https://www.jstor.org/stable/40197287&lt;/ref&gt;

With the academic environment, self-regulated learners usually set their academic goals and monitor and react themselves in process in order to achieve their goals. Schunk argues, "students must regulate not only their actions but also their underlying achievement-related cognitions, beliefs, intentions and effects"(p.&amp;nbsp;359). Moreover, academic self-regulation also helps students develop confidence in their ability to perform well in e-learning courses.&lt;ref name="Williams2004" /&gt;

=== Theoretical framework ===
E-learning literature identifies an ecology of concepts, from  a bibliometric study  were identified the most used concepts associated with the use of computers in learning contexts, e.g. computer assisted  instruction (CAI), computer assisted learning (CAL), computer-based education (CBE), e-learning, learning management systems (LMS), self-directed learning (SDL), and massive open online courses (MOOC). All these concepts have two aspects in common: learning and computers; except the SDL concept, which derives from psychology, and does not necessarily apply to computer usage. These concepts are yet to be studied in scientific research, and stand in contrast to MOOCs. Nowadays, e-learning can also mean massive distribution of content and global classes for all the Internet users. E-learning studies can be focused on three principal dimensions: users, technology, and services. According to Aparicio, Bacao &amp; Oliveira&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aparicio|first=M.|last2=Bacao|first2=F.|last3=Oliveira|first3=T.|date=|year=2016|title=An e-Learning Theoretical Framework|url=http://www.ifets.info/journals/19_1/24.pdf|journal=Educational Technology &amp; Society|publisher=IEEE|volume=19 |issue=1|pages=292–307}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''The e-learning systems' theoretical framework contains the three main components of information systems. These components are people, technologies, and services. People interact with e-learning systems. E-learning technologies enable the direct or indirect interaction of the different groups of users. Technologies provide support to integrate content, enable communication, and provide collaboration tools. E-learning services integrate all the activities corresponding to pedagogical models and to instructional strategies. The complex interaction combination is the direct or indirect action with e-learning systems. At the same time, systems provide services according to the specified strategies for activities. In other words, service specifications are e-learning activities aligned with the e-learning pedagogical models and the instructional strategies''".

==Teacher use of technology==

Computing technology was not created by teachers. There has been little consultation between those who promote its use in schools and those who teach with it. Decisions to purchase technology for education are very often political decisions. Most staff using these technologies did not grow up with them.&lt;ref&gt;Laurillard, D. (2006). Rethinking University Teaching: a framework for the effective use of learning technologies. Abingdon, Oxon., RoutledgeFalmer.&lt;/ref&gt; Training teachers to use computer technology did improve their confidence in its use, but there was considerable dissatisfaction with training content and style of delivery.&lt;ref name="Galanouli2004" /&gt; The communication element, in particular, was highlighted as the least satisfactory part of the training, by which many teachers meant the use of a VLE and discussion forums to deliver online training (Leask 2002). Technical support for online learning, lack of access to hardware, poor monitoring of teacher progress and a lack of support by online tutors were just some of the issues raised by the asynchronous online delivery of training (Davies 2004).

Newer generation [[web 2.0]] services provide customizable, inexpensive platforms for authoring and disseminating multimedia-rich e-learning courses, and do not need specialised [[information technology]] (IT) support.&lt;ref&gt;Tam CW, Eastwood A. Available, intuitive and free! Building e-learning modules using web 2.0 services.Med Teach. 2012;34(12):1078-80. {{DOI|10.3109/0142159X.2012.731105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pedagogical theory may have application in encouraging and assessing online participation.&lt;ref name="Ho2002" /&gt; Assessment methods for on-line participation have reviewed.&lt;ref name="Ho2002" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2103">The '''Elsenburg Agricultural Training Institute''' (officially known, from 1 April 2004, as the '''Cape Institute for Agricultural Training: Elsenburg''') was established in 1898 as the first agricultural [[college]] of its kind in [[South Africa]]. It offers a bachelor's degree in agriculture in association with the Faculty of [[Agriculture]] and Forestry Sciences at the [[University of Stellenbosch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsenburg.com Elsenburg Agricultural Training Institute home page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The college attracted relatively few [[students]] in its first years: having been established in 1898, there were five graduates by June 1899. An average of 44 students per year were enrolled in the years between the turn of the century and the outbreak of World War I, when numbers crashed.{{Tone-inline|date=November 2014}}

An association with the University of Stellenbosch was established in 1926, whereafter a [[diploma]] [[course (education)|course]] was offered to equip prospective [[farmers]].

The [[government]] [[Department of Agriculture (South Africa)|Department of Agriculture]] accepted responsibility for agricultural training at the college from 1973. A significant addition to the academic courses given in this period was a diploma in cellar technology, making the college, since 1976, a major training institution for South African winemakers.

In the post-1994 period, under a new provincial administration in the newly established [[Western Cape|Western Cape Province]], the Elsenburg and Kromme Rhee colleges of agriculture amalgamated. A Centre for Further Education and Training was established to relieve the Department of Agriculture of its responsibilities.

The renewed association with the University of the Stellenbosch was inaugurated on 1 April 2004.

'''Etruscan art''' was produced by the [[Etruscan civilization]] in [[central Italy]] between the 9th and 2nd centuries BC. From around 600 BC it was heavily influenced by [[Greek art]], which was imported by the Etruscans, but always retained distinct characteristics.  Particularly strong in this tradition were figurative sculpture in terracotta (especially life-size on [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] or temples), wall-painting and [[metalworking]] especially in bronze. Jewellery and [[engraved gem]]s of high quality were produced.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 350-351&lt;/ref&gt; 

Etruscan sculpture in cast bronze was famous and widely exported, but relatively few large examples have survived (the material was too valuable, and recycled later).  In contrast to terracotta and bronze, there was relatively little Etruscan sculpture in stone, despite the Etruscans controlling fine sources of marble, including [[Carrara marble]], which seems not to have been exploited until the Romans.  

The great majority of survivals came from tombs, which were typically crammed with [[sarcophagi]] and [[grave goods]], and terracotta fragments of architectural sculpture, mostly around temples.  Tombs have produced all the [[fresco]] wall-paintings, which show scenes of feasting and some narrative mythological subjects. 

[[Bucchero]] wares in black were the early and native styles of fine Etruscan pottery.  There was also a tradition of elaborate [[Etruscan vase painting]], which sprung from its Greek equivalent; the Etruscans were the main export market for [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]].  Etruscan temples were heavily decorated with colourfully painted terracotta [[antefix]]es and other fittings, which survive in large numbers where the wooden superstructure has vanished.  Etruscan art was strongly connected to [[Etruscan religion|religion]]; the afterlife was of major importance in Etruscan art.&lt;ref name="etruscianartmusic"&gt;{{cite book|title=Etruscan Art |first=Nigel |last=Spivey|year=1997 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see|Etruscan history}}
The Etruscans emerged from the preceding [[Villanovan culture]]. Due to the proximity and/or commercial contact to Etruria, other ancient cultures influenced Etruscan art, such as [[Ancient Greek art|Greece]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Assyria]] and the [[Middle East]]. &lt;!--   The apparent simple character in the [[Hellenistic]] era conceals an innovative and unique style whose pinnacle coincided with the [[Archaic period in Greece|Greek archaic period]]. ??? What, if anything, does this mean?--&gt; The Romans would later come to absorb the [[Etruscan society|Etruscan culture]] into theirs but would also be greatly influenced by them and their art.

===Periods===
[[File:A dancing man from the painted walls of the tomb of the Augurs at Tarquinia, 525-500 BCE, Etruscan.jpg|thumb|[[Etruscan Civilization|Etruscan]] dancer in the [[Tomb of the Augurs]], Tarquinia, Italy]]
Etruscan art is usually divided into a number of periods: 

*900 to 675 BC – '''Early Villanovan''' period. Already the emphasis on [[funerary art]] is evident. [[Impasto pottery]] with geometric decoration, or shaped as [[hut urn]]s.  Bronze objects, mostly small except for vessels, were decorated by moulding or by incised lines. Small statuettes were mostly handles or other fittings for vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, 2 (i)&lt;/ref&gt;    
*675–575 BC – '''Oriental''' or Orientalising period.  Foreign trade with established Mediterranean civilizations interested in the metal ores of Etruria and other products from further north led to imports of foreign art, especially that of Ancient Greece, and some Greek artists immigrated.  Decoration adopted a Greek, Egyptian and Near Eastern vocabulary with [[palmette]]s and other motifs, and the foreign [[lion]] was a popular animal to depict. The Etruscan upper class grew wealthy and began to fill their large tombs with [[grave goods]].  A native [[Bucchero]] pottery, now using the [[potter's wheel]], went alongside the start of a Greek-influenced tradition of painted vases, which until 600 drew more from [[Corinth]] than [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;Grove, 2 (ii); Boardman, 349&lt;/ref&gt;   
*575–480 BC – '''Archaic''' period - Prosperity continued to grow, and Greek influence grew to the exclusion of other Mediterranean cultures, despite the two cultures coming into conflict as their respective zones of expansion met each other. The period saw the emergence of the Etruscan temple, with its elaborate and brightly painted [[terracotta]] decorations, and other larger buildings.  Figurative art, including human figures and narrative scenes, grew more prominent.  The Etruscans adopted stories from [[Greek mythology]] enthusiastically.  Paintings in [[fresco]] begin to be found in tombs (which the Greeks had stopped making centuries before), and were perhaps made for some other buildings.  The Persian conquest of [[Ionia]] in 546 saw a significant influx of Greek artist refugees.  Other earlier developments continued, and the period produced much of the finest and most distinctive Etruscan art.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, 2 (iii)&lt;/ref&gt;   
*480–300 BC – '''Classical''' period - The Etruscans had now peaked in economic and political terms, and the volume of art produced reduced somewhat in the 5th century, with prosperity shifting from the coastal cities to the interior, especially the [[Po valley]].  In the 4th century volumes revived somewhat, and previous trends continued to develop without major innovations in the repertoire, except for the arrival of [[red-figure vase painting]], and more sculpture such as sarcophagi in stone rather than terracotta. Bronzes from [[Vulci]] were exported widely within Etruria and beyond.  The Romans were now picking off the Etruscan cities one by one, with [[Veii]] being conquered around 396.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, 2 (iv)&lt;/ref&gt;
*300–50 BC – '''Hellenistic''' or late phase.  Over this period the remaining Etruscan cities were all absorbed into Roman culture, and the extent to which art and architecture should be described as Etruscan or Roman is often difficult to judge. Distinctive Etruscan types of object gradually ceased to be made, with the last painted vases appearing early in the period, and large painted tombs ending in the 2nd century.  Styles continued to follow broad Greek trends, with increasing sophistication and classical realism often accompanied by a loss of energy and character.  [[Bronze]] statues, now increasingly large, were sometimes replicas of Greek models.  The large [[Greek temple]] [[pediment]] groups of sculptures were introduced, but in terracotta.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, 2 (v)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Etruscans were very accomplished sculptors for which notable examples in terracotta and bronze are testimony. Though the renowned "[[Capitoline Wolf]]" (at the [[Capitoline Museums|Capitoline Museum]] of Rome) is now suggested to have been manufactured in the 13th century AD, some of the more famous examples include (in rough chronological order):

*The [[Centaur of Vulci]], 590–580 BC, [[National Etruscan Museum]], from the [[Villa Giulia]]
*the painted terracotta [[Apollo of Veii]], 510–500 BC, from the temple at [[Portanaccio]] attributed to [[Vulca]] at the [[National Etruscan Museum]]

The [[Apollo of Veii]] is a good example of the mastery with which Etruscan artists produced these large art pieces. It was made, along with others, to adorn the temple at [[Portanaccio]]’s roof line. Although its style is reminiscent of the Greek [[Kroisos Kouros]], the notion of having statues on the top of the roof is entirely an Etruscan derivation.&lt;ref name ="Ramage 2009"&gt;(Ramage 2009: 46)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wall-painting==
{{see|Tomb of the Leopards}}
[[File:Tomba del Triclinio SAM 3996.JPG|thumb|Fuller view of the tomb illustrated above]]
[[File:Tomba degli Auguri.jpg|thumb|Rear wall painting in [[Tomb of the Augurs]], Tarquinia, Italy]]
The Etruscan paintings that have survived are almost all wall [[fresco]]es from tombs, mainly located in [[Tarquinia]], and dating from roughly 670 BC to 200 BC, with the peak of production between about 520 and 440 BC.  The Greeks very rarely painted their tombs in the equivalent period, with rare exceptions such as the [[Tomb of the Diver]] in [[Paestum]] and southern Italy, and the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] royal tombs at [[Vergina]].  The whole tradition of Greek painting on walls and panels, arguably the form of art that Greek contemporaries considered their greatest, is almost entirely lost, giving the Etruscan tradition, which undoubtedly drew much from Greek examples, an added importance, even if it does not approach the quality and sophistication of the best Greek masters.  It is clear from literary sources that temples, houses and other buildings also had wall-paintings, but these have all been lost, like their Greek equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;Steingräber, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The Etruscan tombs, which housed the remains of whole lineages, were apparently sites for recurrent family rituals, and the subjects of paintings probably have a more religious character than might at first appear. A few detachable painted terracotta panels have been found in tombs, up to about a metre tall, and fragments in city centres.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 243; Vermeule, 157-162&lt;/ref&gt;

The frescoes are created by applying paint on top of fresh plaster, so that when the plaster dries the painting becomes part of the plaster, and consequently an integral part of the wall. Colors were created from ground up minerals of different colors and were then mixed to the paint. Fine brushes were made of animal hair.

From the mid 4th century BC [[chiaroscuro]] modelling began to be used to portray depth and volume.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 352&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes scenes of everyday life are portrayed, but more often traditional mythological scenes. The depiction of human anatomy never approaches Greek levels. The concept of proportion does not appear in any surviving frescoes and we frequently find portrayals of animals or men out of proportion. One of the best-known Etruscan frescoes is that of the Tomb of the Lioness at Tarquinia.

==Vase painting==

{{main|Etruscan vase painting}}
Etruscan vase painting was produced from the 7th through the 4th centuries BC, and is a major element in Etruscan art. It was strongly influenced by [[Greek vase painting]], followed the main trends in style, especially those of [[Athens]], over the period, but lagging behind by some decades. The Etruscans used the same techniques, and largely the same shapes. Both the [[black-figure vase painting]] and the later [[red-figure vase painting]] techniques were used.  The subjects were also very often drawn from Greek mythology in later periods. 

Besides being producers in their own right, the Etruscans were the main export market for Greek pottery outside Greece, and some Greek painters probably moved to Etruria, where richly decorated vases were a standard element of grave inventories.  It has been suggested that many or most elaborately painted vases were specifically bought to be used in burials, as a substitute, cheaper and less likely to attract robbers, for the vessels in silver and bronze that the elite would have used in life.

More fully characteristic of Etruscan ceramic art are the burnished, unglazed [[bucchero]] terracotta wares, rendered black in a reducing kiln deprived of oxygen. This was an Etruscan development based on the pottery techniques of the Etruscans' Villanovan predecessors.

==Painted terracotta panels==
A few large terracotta [[Pinax|pinakes]] or plaques, much larger than are typical in Greek art, have been found in tombs, some forming a series that creates in effect a portable wall-painting.  The "Boccanera" tomb at the Banditaccia [[necropolis]] at [[Cerveteri]] contained five panels almost a metre high set round the wall, which are now in the [[British Museum]].  Three of them form a single scene, apparently the [[Judgement of Paris]], while the other two flanked the inside of the entrance, with [[sphinx]]es acting as [[tomb guardian]]s. They date to about 560 BC. Fragments of similar panels have been found in city centre sites, presumably from temples, elite houses and other buildings, where the subjects include scenes of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 242-243&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metalwork==
[[File:Etruscan antiquities in the British Museum DSCF0012 02.JPG|thumb|230px|left|Relief mirror-back with "Herekele" ([[Hercules]]) seizing Mlacuch (500–475 BC)]]
The Etruscans were masters of bronze-working as shown by the many outstanding examples in museums, and from accounts of the statues sent to Rome after their conquest. &lt;ref&gt;Ancient Rome as a Museum: Power, Identity, and the Culture of Collecting, Steven Rutledge, OUP Oxford, 26 Apr 2012&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pliny, the Romans looted 2,000 bronze statues from the city of [[Volsinii]] alone after capturing it.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny: Historia Naturalis xxxiv.16&lt;/ref&gt;   

The [[Monteleone chariot]] is one of the finest examples of large bronzework and is the best-preserved and most complete of the surviving works.

The Etruscans had a strong tradition of working in [[bronze]] from very early times, and their small bronzes were widely exported. Apart from cast bronze, the Etruscans were also skilled at the engraving of cast pieces with complex linear images, whose lines were filled with a white material to highlight them; in modern museum conditions with this filling lost, and the surface inevitably somewhat degraded, they are often much less striking and harder to read than would have been the case originally. This technique was mostly applied to the roundish backs of polished bronze mirrors and to the sides of [[cista]]e.  A major centre for cista manufacture was [[Praeneste]], which somewhat like early Rome was an Italic-speaking town in the Etruscan cultural sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 351-352&lt;/ref&gt;  Some mirrors, or mirror covers (used to protect the mirror's reflective surface) are in a low [[relief]].

==Funerary art==
[[File:British Museum Etruscan 8-2.jpg|thumb|Painted terracotta [[Sarcophagus of Seianti Hanunia Tlesnasa]], about 150–130 BCE]]

The Etruscans excelled in portraying humans. Throughout their history they used two sets of burial practices: [[cremation]] and [[inhumation]].&lt;ref&gt;(Turfa 2005: 55)&lt;/ref&gt; Cinerary urns (for cremation) and sarcophagi (for inhumation) have been found together in the same tomb showing that throughout generations, both forms were used at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;(Richter 1940: 56, note 1)&lt;/ref&gt;   
In the 7th century they started depicting human heads on canopic urns and when they started burying their dead in the late 6th century they did so in terracotta sarcophagi.&lt;ref name="Ramage 2009:51"&gt;(Ramage 2009:51)&lt;/ref&gt; These sarcophagi were decorated with an image of the deceased reclining on the lid alone or sometimes with a spouse.  The Etruscans invented the custom of placing figures on the lid which later influenced the Romans to do the same.&lt;ref name="Ramage 2009:51"/&gt; These urns were widely popular in Etruria and, from there, the style made its way to Chiusi. Etruscans made urns using unrefined clay such as impasto. This was discovered due to their almost exact resemblance to one another. They have been identified as far back as the third century B.C. and are technically still used to this day (caskets.) Examples of these pieces can be found today in museums all around the world.

The Hellenistic period funerary urns were generally made in two pieces. The top lid usually depicted a banqueting man or woman (but not always) and the container part was either decorated in relief in the front only or, on more elaborate stone pieces, carved on its sides.&lt;ref&gt;(Maggiani 1985: 34)&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the terracotta urns were being mass-produced using clay in Northern Etruria (specifically in and around [[Chiusi]]).&lt;ref&gt;(Maggiani 1985: 100)&lt;/ref&gt; Often the scenes decorated in relief on the front of the urn were depicting generic Greek influenced scenes.&lt;ref&gt;(Nielsen 1995:328)&lt;/ref&gt; The production of these urns did not require skilled artists and so what we are left with is often mediocre, unprofessional art, made en masse.&lt;ref&gt;(Richter 1940: 50)&lt;/ref&gt; However the color choices on the urns offer evidence as to dating, as colors used changed over time.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Art and religion==
[[Image:5th-4th century BCE Etruscan necklace by Mary Harrsch.jpg|thumb|5th to 4th century BC necklace in gold]]
Etruscan art was often religious in character and, hence, strongly connected to the requirements of [[Etruscan religion]].  The Etruscan afterlife was negative, in contrast to the positive view in [[ancient Egypt]] where it was but a continuation of earthly life, or the confident relations with the gods as in [[ancient Greek religion|ancient Greece]].{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2011}}  Roman interest in Etruscan religion centred on their methods of [[divination]] and propitiating and discovering the will of the gods, rather than the gods themselves, which may have distorted the information that has come down to us.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, 3&lt;/ref&gt; Most remains of Etruscan [[funerary art]] have been found in excavations of cemeteries (as at [[Cerveteri]], [[Tarquinia]], [[Populonia]], [[Orvieto]], [[Vetulonia]], [[Norchia]]), meaning that what we see of Etruscan art is primarily dominated by depictions of religion and in particular the [[funerary cult]], whether or not that is a true reflection of Etruscan art as a whole.

==Museums==
Etruscan tombs were heavily looted from early on, initially for precious metals.  From the Renaissance onwards Etruscan objects, especially painted vases and sarcophagi, were keenly collected. Many were exported before this was forbidden, and most major museum collections of classical art around the world have good selections.  But the major collections remain in Italian museums in Rome, Florence, and other cities in areas that were formerly Etruscan, which include the results of [[modern archaeology]].

Major collections in Italy include the [[National Etruscan Museum]] ({{lang-it|Museo Nazionale Etrusco}}) in the [[Villa Giulia]] in Rome, [[National Archaeological Museum (Florence)|National Archaeological Museum]] in Florence, [[Vatican Museums]], [[Tarquinia National Museum]], and the [[The Archeological Civic Museum (MCA) of Bologna|Archeological Civic Museum]] in [[Bologna]], as well as more local collections near important sites such as [[Cerveteri]], [[Orvieto]] and [[Perugia]].

{{ForensicScience|disciplines|image=Dent cassee sur une roue spiro-conique.jpg}}
'''Forensic engineering''' has been defined as ''"the investigation of failures - ranging from serviceability to catastrophic - which may lead to legal activity, including both civil and criminal".''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forensic Engineering - a professional approach to investigation|last=Neale (Ed)|first=B S|publisher=Thomas Telford|year=1999|isbn=|location=London|pages=i}}&lt;/ref&gt;    It  therefore includes  the investigation of [[material science|materials]], [[product (business)|products]], [[structure]]s or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing [[personal injury]], damage to property or economic loss. The consequences of failure may give rise to action under either criminal or civil law including but not limited to  health and safety legislation, the laws of contract and/or [[product liability]] and the laws of [[Tort|tort.]]  The field also deals with retracing processes and procedures leading to accidents in operation of vehicles or machinery.  Generally, the purpose of a [[Forensics|forensic]] [[engineering]] investigation is to locate cause or causes of failure with a view to improve performance or life of a component, or to assist a court in determining the facts of an [[accident]]. It can also involve investigation of [[intellectual property]] claims, especially [[patent]]s.

==History==
As the field of engineering has evolved over time, so has the field of forensic engineering. Early examples include investigation of [[bridge failure]]s such as the [[Tay Bridge disaster|Tay rail bridge disaster]] of 1879 and the [[Dee bridge disaster]] of 1847. Many early rail accidents prompted the invention of [[tensile test]]ing of samples and [[fractography]] of failed components.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History Of Metallography: The Development Of Ideas On The Structure Of Metals Before 1890 |last=Smith |first=Cyril Stanley|authorlink=Cyril Stanley Smith|origyear=1960|publisher=MIT Press |year=1988|isbn=9780262691208|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
Vital to the field of forensic engineering is the process of investigating and collecting data related to the materials, products, structures or components that failed. This involves inspections, collecting evidence, measurements, developing models, obtaining exemplar products, and performing experiments. Often testing and measurements are conducted in an [[Independent testing laboratory]] or other reputable unbiased laboratory.

==Analysis==
[[Failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA) and [[fault tree analysis]] methods also examine product or process failure in a structured and systematic way, in the general context of [[safety engineering]]. However, all such techniques rely on accurate reporting of [[failure rate]]s, and precise identification, of the failure modes involved.

There is some common ground between forensic science and forensic engineering, such as scene of crime and scene of accident analysis, integrity of the evidence and court appearances. Both disciplines make extensive use of optical and [[scanning electron microscope]]s, for example. They also share common use of [[spectroscopy]] ([[infrared]], [[ultraviolet]], and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]]) to examine critical evidence. [[Radiography]] using [[X-ray]]s (such as [[X-ray computed tomography]]), or [[neutron]]s is also very useful in examining thick products for their internal defects before destructive examination is attempted. Often, however, a simple [[Magnifying glass|hand lens]] may reveal the cause of a particular problem.

[[Trace evidence]] is sometimes an important factor in reconstructing the sequence of events in an accident. For example, tire burn marks on a road surface can enable vehicle speeds to be estimated, when the brakes were applied and so on. Ladder feet often leave a trace of movement of the ladder during a slipaway, and may show how the accident occurred. When a product fails for no obvious reason, [[scanning electron microscope|SEM]] and [[Energy-dispersive X&amp;#8209;ray spectroscopy]] (EDX) performed in the microscope can reveal the presence of aggressive chemicals that have left traces on the fracture or adjacent surfaces. Thus an [[polyoxymethylene plastic|acetal resin]] water pipe joint suddenly failed and caused substantial damages to a building in which it was situated. Analysis of the joint showed traces of chlorine, indicating a [[stress corrosion cracking]] failure mode. The failed fuel pipe junction mentioned above showed traces of [[sulfur]] on the fracture surface from the [[sulfuric acid]], which had initiated the crack.

Extracting physical evidence from digital photography is a major technique used in forensic accident reconstruction. [[Match moving|Camera matching]], [[photogrammetry]], and [[Image rectification|photo rectification]] techniques are used to create three-dimensional and top-down views from the two-dimensional photos typically taken at an accident scene. Overlooked or undocumented evidence for accident reconstruction can be retrieved and quantified as long as photographs of such evidence are available. By using photographs of the accident scene including the vehicle, "lost" evidence can be recovered and accurately determined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veritecheng.com/white-paper-forensic-accident-reconstruction/ Extracting Physical Evidence from Digital Photographs for use in Forensic Accident Reconstruction], David Danaher, P.E., Jeff Ball, Ph.D., P.E., and Mark Kittel, P.E, 6-15-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Forensic materials engineering]] involves methods applied to specific materials, such as [[metal]]s, [[glass]]es, [[ceramic]]s, [[composite material|composites]] and [[polymer]]s.

==Examples==
[[image:Plate7new.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Failed fuel pipe at right from a road traffic accident.]]
[[image:Plate4new.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Close-up of the broken fuel pipe from a road traffic accident.]]
[[Image:Broken fuel pipe.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Close-up of the broken fuel pipe.]]
The broken fuel pipe shown at left caused a serious accident when [[diesel fuel]] poured out from a van onto the road. A following car skidded and the driver was seriously injured when she collided with an oncoming [[lorry]]. [[Scanning electron microscopy]] or SEM showed that the [[nylon]] connector had fractured by [[stress corrosion cracking]] (SCC) due to a small leak of [[battery acid]]. Nylon is susceptible to [[hydrolysis]] when in contact with [[sulfuric acid]], and only a small leak of acid would have sufficed to start a brittle crack in the [[injection moulded]] [[nylon&amp;nbsp;6,6]] connector by  SCC. The crack took about 7 days to grow across the diameter of the tube. The fracture surface showed a mainly brittle surface with striations indicating progressive growth of the crack across the diameter of the pipe. Once the crack had penetrated the inner bore, fuel started leaking onto the road.

The nylon&amp;nbsp;6,6 had been attacked by the following reaction, which was catalyzed by the acid:
:[[image:amide hydrolysis.svg]]

[[Diesel fuel]] is especially hazardous on road surfaces because it forms a thin, oily film that cannot be easily seen by drivers. It is much like [[black ice]] in its slipperiness, so skids are common when diesel leaks occur. The insurers of the van driver admitted liability and the injured driver was compensated.

==Applications==
Most manufacturing models will have a forensic component that monitors early failures to improve quality or efficiencies. Insurance companies use forensic engineers to prove liability or nonliability. Most engineering disasters ([[structural failure]]s such as bridge and building collapses) are subject to forensic investigation by engineers experienced in forensic methods of investigation. [[Rail crashes]], [[aviation accidents and incidents|aviation accidents]], and some [[car accident|automobile accidents]] are investigated by forensic engineers in particular where component failure is suspected. Furthermore, appliances, consumer products, medical devices, structures, industrial machinery, and even simple hand tools such as hammers or chisels can warrant investigations upon incidents causing injury or property damages. The failure of [[medical device]]s is often [[life-critical system|safety-critical]] to the user, so reporting failures and analysing them is particularly important. The environment of the body is complex, and [[implant (medicine)|implants]] must both survive this environment, and not leach potentially toxic impurities. Problems have been reported with [[breast implant]]s, [[heart valve]]s, and [[catheter]]s, for example.

Failures that occur early in the life of a new product are vital information for the manufacturer to improve the product. [[New product development]] aims to eliminate defects by testing in the factory before launch, but some may occur during its early life. Testing products to simulate their behavior in the external environment is a difficult skill, and may involve [[accelerated life testing]] for example. The worst kind of defect to occur after launch is a [[life-critical system|safety-critical]] defect, a defect that can endanger life or limb. Their discovery usually leads to a [[product recall]] or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Product defects often follow the [[bathtub curve]], with high initial failures, a lower rate during regular life, followed by another rise due to wear-out. National standards, such as those of [[ASTM International|ASTM]] and the [[BSI Group|British Standards Institute]], and [[International standard|International Standard]]s can help the designer in increasing product integrity.

==Historic examples==
[[Image:Dee bridge disaster.jpg|thumb|right|350px|[[Dee bridge disaster]].]]
There are many examples of forensic methods used to investigate accidents and disasters, one of the earliest in the modern period being the fall of the [[Dee bridge]] at [[Chester]], [[England]]. It was built using [[cast iron]] [[girder]]s, each of which was made of three very large castings dovetailed together. Each girder was strengthened by [[wrought iron]] bars along the length. It was finished in September 1846, and opened for local traffic after approval by the first Railway Inspector, General Charles Pasley. However, on 24 May 1847, a local train to [[Ruabon]] fell through the bridge. The accident resulted in five deaths (three passengers, the train guard, and the locomotive fireman) and nine serious injuries. The bridge had been designed by [[Robert Stephenson]], and he was accused of negligence by a local [[inquest]].

Although strong in compression, cast iron was known to be brittle in tension or bending. On the day of the accident, the bridge deck was covered with track ballast to prevent the oak beams supporting the track from catching fire, imposing a heavy extra load on the girders supporting the bridge and probably exacerbating the accident. Stephenson took this precaution because of a recent fire on the Great Western Railway at Uxbridge, London, where Isambard Kingdom Brunel's bridge caught fire and collapsed.

One of the first major inquiries conducted by the newly formed [[Railway Inspectorate]] was conducted by Captain Simmons of the [[Royal Engineers]], and his report suggested that repeated flexing of the girder weakened it substantially. He examined the broken parts of the main girder, and confirmed that the girder had broken in two places, the first break occurring at the center. He tested the remaining girders by driving a locomotive across them, and found that they deflected by several inches under the moving load. He concluded that the design was flawed, and that the wrought iron trusses fixed to the girders did not reinforce the girders at all, which was a conclusion also reached by the jury at the inquest. Stephenson's design had depended on the wrought iron trusses to strengthen the final structures, but they were anchored on the cast iron girders themselves, and so deformed with any load on the bridge. Others (especially Stephenson) argued that the train had derailed and hit the girder, the [[impact force]] causing it to [[fracture]]. However, [[Witness|eyewitnesses]] maintained that the girder broke first and the fact that the [[locomotive]] remained on the track showed otherwise.

==Publications==
Product failures are not widely published in the [[academic literature]] or trade literature, partly because companies do not want to advertise their problems. However, it then denies others the opportunity to improve product design so as to prevent further accidents. However, a notable exception to the reluctance to publish is the journal ''Engineering Failure Analysis'', which publishes case studies of a wide range of different products, failing under different circumstances. There are also an increasing number of textbooks becoming available.

Another notable publication, dealing with failures of buildings, bridges, and other structures, is the ''Journal of Performance of Constructed Facilities'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://scitation.aip.org/cfo/ Scitation.aip.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
which is published by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]], under the umbrella of its Technical Council on Forensic Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tcfe.asce.org// tcfe.asce.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Dies Natalis UGM Harian Umum 3 January 1951 p1.jpg|thumb|''Dies Natalis'' celebrations in 1950]]
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Ingang rechtenfaculteit Gadjah Mada Universiteit bij de kraton van de Sultan TMnr 20025548.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance of former campus of the UGM's Faculty of Law near the [[Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat|Sultan's palace]]]]

UGM was the first [[state university]] in [[Indonesia]], established as '''Universiteit Negeri Gadjah Mada (UNGM)''' when Indonesia was still facing threats from the [[Netherlands]], who wanted to regain control. At the time, the capital of Indonesia had moved from [[Jakarta]] to [[Yogyakarta]].&lt;ref name=Bagi&gt;{{cite book |last1=Suwarni |last2=Santoso |first2=Heri |title=60 Tahun Sumbangsih UGM Bagi Bangsa |trans-title=60 Years of Contributions by UGM to the Nation |year=2009 |location=Yogyakarta |publisher=Universitas Gadjah Mada |language=Indonesian |isbn=978-979-420-089-6 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=17 April 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

UGM was established through Government Regulation (PP) No. 23 of 1949, regarding the merger of colleges to form a university. Although the regulations were dated 16 December, UGM's inauguration took place on 19 December, intentionally chosen to coincide with the anniversary of the Dutch invasion of the city of Yogyakarta, exactly one year prior on 19 December 1948. The intentional date was meant to show that one year after the Netherlands had invaded the city, the government would establish a nationwide university there.&lt;ref name=Bagi/&gt;

When it was founded, UGM had six faculties: Medicine, [[Dentistry]], and [[Pharmacy]]; Law, Social and Political Sciences; Engineering; Letters, [[Pedagogy]] and [[Philosophy]]; Agriculture; and [[Veterinary Medicine]].

From 1952 until 1972, the Faculty of Law, Social and Political Sciences was split into two faculties: the [[Surabaya]] branch of the Faculty of Law, Social, and Political Sciences; and the Faculty of Education and Teacher Training, which was integrated into IKIP Yogyakarta (now [[Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta]]).&lt;ref name="History2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ugm.ac.id/en/node/1322-brief.history|title=Gadjah Mada University: History (Logo and Philosophy)|website=Universitas Gadjah Mada |date=22 January 2011 |accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its initial years of Dutch resistance, the university taught literature and law in the buildings and other facilities belonging to the [[Kraton (Indonesia)|palace]] of [[Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX|Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX]], who volunteered his palace for the university’s use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tesoro|first=José Manuel|title=The Invisible Palace: The True Story of a Journalist's Murder in Java|date=2004|publisher=Equinox Publishing|location=Jakarta|isbn=978-9799796479|page=41|edition=First|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yslLeQrRtK4C&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;ots=IbMDOAznAh&amp;dq=mada%20Hamengkubuwono&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q=mada%20Hamengkubuwono&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; UGM gradually established a campus of its own in Bulaksumur, on the northern side of Yogyakarta, and now occupies an area of three square kilometres.&lt;ref name="History2"/&gt;

==Main buildings==
[[Image:Gadjah Mada HeadOffice.jpg|thumb|Balairung, home of the university's central administration offices]]

The UGM main building is called the ''Balairung'' (rectorate building), in [[Sleman Regency|Sleman]]. Nearby is the ''Graha Sabha Pramana'', a large building utilized for graduation ceremonies, with an adjoining square used for sport and recreation.&lt;ref name=Maplandia2005&gt;{{cite web |title=Graha Sabha Pramana Map |website=Maplandia |url=http://www.maplandia.com/indonesia/d-i-yogyakarta/kodya-yogyakarta/yogyakarta/buildings/graha-sabha-pramana/ |date=2005 |accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a university library and a sports center, consisting of a stadium, tennis court, and basketball field.

==Faculties and schools==
The UGM administration is divided into 18 faculties, offering study programs from the undergraduate to doctoral level.&lt;ref name=UGMFaculty/&gt; There is also a vocational school offering vocational study programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vocational School  |url=http://ugm.ac.id/en/academics/1328-vocational.school |year=2013 |website=Universitas Gadjah Mada |accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yogyakarta Principles==
The [[Yogyakarta Principles]], a set of principles launched in [[Geneva, Switzerland]] intended to apply [[international human rights law]] guidelines for the [[human rights]] of [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) people, were developed at Gadjah Mada University.&lt;ref name="YP"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corrêa|first1=Sonia Onufer|last2=Muntarbhorn|first2=Vitit|title=Introduction to the Yogyakarta Principles|url=http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/introduction/|website=Yogyakarta Principles|accessdate=8 August 2017|quote=A distinguished group of human rights experts has drafted, developed, discussed and refined these Principles. Following an experts’ meeting held at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, Indonesia from 6 to 9 November 2006, 29 distinguished experts from 25 countries with diverse backgrounds and expertise relevant to issues of human rights law unanimously adopted the Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISHR"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Narrain|first1=Arvind|last2=Patel|first2=Pooja|title=The Yogyakarta Principles on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity: Establishing the Universality of Human Rights|url=https://www.ishr.ch/news/yogyakarta-principles-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-establishing-universality-human|website=International Service for Human Rights|accessdate=8 August 2017|date=2 November 2016|quote=Ten years ago, a distinguished group of human rights experts from around the world came together at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.

==Controversies==

=== 2017 Alleged Sexual Assault Cover-Up ===
On 5 November 2018, UGM’s [[Student publication|student body publication]], ''Balairung Press'', published an article containing the account, from a female student ("Agni"), of an alleged [[rape]] she experienced at the hands of a male fellow student ("HS") while doing a [[Community service#Colleges|student work experience]] (''Kuliah Kerja Nyata'' – KKN) program in [[Seram Island]], [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]] in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.balairungpress.com/2018/11/nalar-pincang-ugm-atas-kasus-perkosaan/|title=Nalar Pincang UGM atas Kasus Perkosaan {{!}} Balairungpress|date=2018-11-05|work=Balairungpress|access-date=2018-11-14|language=id-ID}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When learning of the rape allegation, UGM–KKN officials chose not to forward Agni's [[Sexual assault|accusation]] to the police. Instead, they were skeptical of Agni's account. Regardless, HS was pulled from the KKN program about a week later because he was deemed to be "incompatible" with other KKN participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/id-id/berita/nasional/mahasiswi-ugm-diperkosa-sesama-mahasiswa-saat-kkn-di-maluku-jadi-polemik-setelah-korban-buka-suara/ar-BBPqv6C|title=Mahasiswi UGM Diperkosa Sesama Mahasiswa saat KKN di Maluku, Jadi Polemik Setelah Korban Buka Suara|website=www.msn.com|language=id-ID|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Agni returned to Yogyakarta in September 2017, she received a [[Grading systems by country|C-grade]] for the program, apparently in retaliation for the shame her allegation had brought upon an official. Agni then filed a formal complaint about her alleged rape to higher-ranking officials at the university, who raised her grade to A/B but still did not report HS to law enforcement. Instead, the university agreed to pay for the counseling Agni had been seeking to deal with her trauma, as well as requiring HS to go to counseling as well. HS was allowed to take part in another KKN program the semester after the alleged rape, and he is expected to graduate soon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_asia/article/yw7z3b/sexual-assault-cover-up-indonesia-university-gadjah-mada-ugm|title=Student Journalists Expose Alleged Sexual Assault Cover-Up at Indonesian University|date=2018-11-07|work=Vice|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en-asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UGM Spokesperson Iva Ariani confirmed the account as told in Balairung Press and says that the university is now taking further steps to investigate the rape allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.tempo.co/read/news/2018/11/14/057923419/A-Year-Old-UGM-Rape-Case-finally-Investigated-by-National-Police|title=A Year-Old UGM Rape Case finally Investigated by National Police|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The case as told in Balairung Press did indeed happen. UGM has extraordinary empathy for the victim, we are also concerned about the incident", she told ''[[Kompas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://regional.kompas.com/read/2018/11/06/21513691/ini-tanggapan-ugm-terkait-dugaan-pelecehan-seksual-saat-kkn|title=Ini Tanggapan UGM Terkait Dugaan Pelecehan Seksual Saat KKN - Kompas.com|last=Media|first=Kompas Cyber|date=2018-11-06|work=KOMPAS.com|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://coconuts.co/jakarta/news/student-newspaper-expose-sexual-assault-puts-prestigious-indonesian-university-center-scandal/|title=Student newspaper exposé on sexual assault puts prestigious Indonesian university at center of scandal {{!}} Coconuts Jakarta|website=coconuts.co|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Utrecht]], [[Museum Catharijneconvent]]. The orb, or the globe of the world, is almost exclusively associated with the Father in depictions of the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref name="George Ferguson page 222"&gt;George Ferguson, 1996 ''Signs &amp; symbols in Christian art'' {{ISBN|0-19-501432-4}} page 222&lt;/ref&gt;]]
For about a thousand years, in obedience to interpretations of specific [[Bible]] passages, pictorial '''depictions of God in Western Christianity''' had been avoided by [[Christian]] artists. At first only the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]], often emerging from a cloud, was portrayed.  Gradually, portrayals of the head and later the whole figure were depicted, and by the time of the [[Renaissance]] artistic representations of [[God the Father]] were freely used in the Western Church.&lt;ref&gt;George Ferguson, 1996 ''Signs &amp; symbols in Christian art'', {{ISBN|0-19-501432-4}} page 92&lt;/ref&gt;

God the Father can be seen in some late Byzantine [[Cretan School]] icons, and ones from the borders of the Catholic and Orthodox worlds, under Western influence, but after the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] came down firmly against depicting him in 1667, he can hardly be seen in Russian art.  Protestants generally disapprove of the depiction of God the Father, and originally did so strongly.

==Background and early history==
Early Christians believed that the words of [[Book of Exodus]] 33:20 "Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see Me and live" and of the [[Gospel of John]] 1:18: "No man hath seen God at any time" were meant to apply not only to the Father, but to all attempts at the depiction of the Father.&lt;ref name="James Cornwell page 2"&gt;James Cornwell, 2009 ''Saints, Signs, and Symbols: The Symbolic Language of Christian Art'' {{ISBN|0-8192-2345-X}} page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Enluminure Drogon c.jpg|thumb|The [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] symbol in the [[Ascension of Christ|Ascension]] from the [[Drogo Sacramentary]], c. 850]]
The [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]], an artistic metaphor, is found several times in the only ancient [[synagogue]] with a large surviving decorative scheme, the [[Dura Europos Synagogue]] of the mid-3rd century, and was probably adopted into [[Early Christian art]] from [[Jewish art]]. It was common in [[Late Antique]] art in both East and West, and remained the main way of depicting the actions or approval of God the Father in the West until about the end of the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque period]]. It also represents the ''[[bath Kol]]'' (literally "daughter of a voice") or voice of God,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;A matter disputed by some scholars&lt;/ref&gt; similar to Jewish depictions.

Historically considered, God the Father is more frequently manifested in the [[Old Testament]], while the Son is manifested in the [[New Testament]]. Hence it might be said that the Old Testament refers more especially to the history of the Father and the New Testament to that of the Son. Yet, in early depictions of scenes from the Old Testament, artists used the conventional [[depiction of Jesus]] to represent the Father,&lt;ref&gt;Adolphe Napoléon Didron, 2003 ''Christian iconography: or The history of Christian art in the middle ages, Volume 1'' {{ISBN|0-7661-4075-X}} pages 167&lt;/ref&gt; especially in depictions of the story of [[Adam and Eve]], the most frequently depicted Old Testament narrative shown in Early Medieval art, and one that was felt to require the depiction of a figure of God "walking in the garden" (Genesis 3:8).

The account in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] naturally credits the [[Creation according to Genesis|Creation]] to the single figure of God, in Christian terms, God the Father.  However the first person plural in Genesis 1:26 "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness", and New Testament references to Christ as Creator (John 1:3, Colossians 1:15) led Early Christian writers to associate the Creation with the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]], or pre-existing Christ, [[God the Son]].  From the 4th century the church was also keen to affirm the doctrine of [[consubstantiality]] confirmed in the [[Nicene Creed]] of 325.


It was therefore usual to have depictions of Jesus as Logos taking the place of the Father and creating the world alone, or commanding [[Noah's Ark|Noah]] to construct the ark or speaking to Moses from the [[Burning bush]].&lt;ref&gt;Adolphe Napoléon Didron, 2003 ''Christian iconography: or The history of Christian art in the middle ages, Volume 1'' {{ISBN|0-7661-4075-X}} pages 167-170&lt;/ref&gt;  There was also a brief period in the 4th century when the [[Trinity]] were depicted as three near-identical figures, mostly in depicting scenes from Genesis; the [[Dogmatic Sarcophagus]] in the Vatican is the best known example.  In isolated cases this iconography is found throughout the Middle Ages, and revived somewhat from the 15th century, though it [[Trinity#Less common types of depiction|attracted increasing disapproval]] from church authorities.  A variant is [[Enguerrand Quarton]]'s contract for the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] requiring him to represent the Father and Son of the Holy Trinity as identical figures.&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Thiébaut: "Enguerrand Quarton", Grove Art Online. Oxford University Press, 2007, [http://www.groveart.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

One scholar has suggested that the enthroned figure in the centre of the [[apse]] mosaic of [[Santa Pudenziana]] in Rome of 390-420, normally regarded as Christ, in fact represents [[God the Father]].&lt;ref&gt;Suggestion by F.W. Sclatter, see review by W. Eugene Kleinbauer of ''The Clash of Gods: A Reinterpretation of Early Christian Art'', by Thomas F. Mathews, ''Speculum'', Vol. 70, No. 4 (Oct., 1995), pp. 937-941, Medieval Academy of America, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2865390 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In situations, such as the [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]], where a specific representation of God the Father was indicated, the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] was used, with increasing freedom from the [[Carolingian art|Carolingian period]] until the end of the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]].  This motif now, since the discovery of the 3rd-century [[Dura Europos synagogue]], seems to have been borrowed from [[Jewish art]], and is found in Christian art almost from its beginnings.

The use of religious images in general continued to increase up to the end of the 7th century, to the point that in 695, upon assuming the throne, [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian II]] put an image of Christ on the obverse side of his gold coins, resulting in a rift which ended the use of [[Byzantine]] coin types in the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Cormack, 1985 ''Writing in Gold, Byzantine Society and its Icons'', {{ISBN|0-540-01085-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the increase in religious imagery did not include depictions of God the Father. For instance, while the eighty second canon of the [[Council of Trullo]] in 692 did not specifically condemn images of The Father, it suggested that icons of [[Christ]] were preferred over Old Testament shadows and figures.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Bigham, 1995 ''Image of God the Father in Orthodox Theology and Iconography'' {{ISBN|1-879038-15-3}} page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of the 8th century witnessed the suppression and destruction of religious icons as the period of [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] (literally ''image-breaking'') started. Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] (717&amp;ndash;741), suppressed the use of icons by [[emperor|imperial]] [[edict]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]], presumably due to a military loss which he attributed to the undue veneration of icons.&lt;ref&gt;According to accounts by Patriarch Nikephoros and the chronicler Theophanes&lt;/ref&gt; The edict (which was issued without consulting the Church) forbade the veneration of religious images but did not apply to other forms of art, including the image of the emperor, or religious symbols such as the cross.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Treadgold, A History of the Byzantine State and Society, Stanford University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Theological arguments against icons then began to appear with [[iconoclasm|iconoclasts]] arguing that icons could not represent both the divine and the human natures of Jesus at the same time. In this atmosphere, no public depictions of God the Father were even attempted and such depictions only began to appear two centuries later.

==The end of iconoclasm==
[[File:Gottvater thronend Westfalen 15 Jh.jpg|thumb|240px|God the Father on a throne, with the [[Virgin Mary]] and Jesus, [[Westphalia]], Germany, late 15th century.]]
The [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787 effectively ended the first period of [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] and restored the honouring of icons and holy images in general.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gibbon, 1995 ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' {{ISBN|0-679-60148-1}} page 1693&lt;/ref&gt; However, this did not immediately translate into large scale depictions of God the Father. Even supporters of the use of icons in the 8th century, such as Saint [[John of Damascus]], drew a distinction between images of God the Father and those of Christ.

In his treatise ''On the Divine Images'' John of Damascus wrote: "In former times, God who is without form or body, could never be depicted. But now when God is seen in the flesh conversing with men, I make an image of the God whom I see".&lt;ref&gt;St. John of Damascus, ''Three Treatises on the Divine Images'' {{ISBN|0-88141-245-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implication here is that insofar as God the Father or the Spirit did not become man, visible and tangible, images and portrait icons can not be depicted. So what was true for the whole [[Trinity]] before Christ remains true for the Father and the [[Holy Spirit|Spirit]] but not for the Word. John of Damascus wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Steven Bigham, 1995 ''Image of God the Father in Orthodox Theology and Iconography'' {{ISBN|1-879038-15-3}} page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"If we attempt to make an image of the invisible God, this would be sinful indeed. It is impossible to portray one who is without body:invisible, uncircumscribed and without form."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Around 790 [[Charlemagne]] ordered a set of four books that became known as the [[Libri Carolini]] (i.e. "Charles' books") to refute what his court mistakenly understood to be the iconoclast decrees of the Byzantine [[Second Council of Nicaea]] regarding sacred images. Although not well known during the Middle Ages, these books describe the key elements of the Catholic theological position on sacred images. To the [[Western Church]], images were just objects made by craftsmen, to be utilized for stimulating the senses of the faithful, and to be respected for the sake of the subject represented, not in themselves.

The [[Council of Constantinople (869)]] (considered ecumenical by the Western Church, but not the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Church]]) reaffirmed the decisions of the Second Council of Nicaea and helped stamp out any remaining coals of [[iconoclasm]]. Specifically, its third canon required the image of Christ to have veneration equal with that of a Gospel book:&lt;ref&gt;Gesa Elsbeth Thiessen, 2005 ''Theological aesthetics'' {{ISBN|0-8028-2888-4}} page 65&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We decree that the sacred image of our Lord Jesus Christ, the liberator and Savior of all people, must be venerated with the same honor as is given the book of the holy Gospels. For as through the language of the words contained in this book all can reach salvation, so, due to the action which these images exercise by their colors, all wise and simple alike, can derive profit from them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But images of God the Father were not directly addressed in Constantinople in 869. A list of permitted icons was enumerated at this Council, but images of God the Father were not among them.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Bigham, 1995 ''Image of God the Father in Orthodox Theology and Iconography'' {{ISBN|1-879038-15-3}} page 41&lt;/ref&gt; However, the general acceptance of icons and holy images began to create an atmosphere in which God the Father could be depicted.{{cn|date=June 2016|reason=this was before the schism between Catholic and Orthodox}}

==Middle ages to the Renaissance==
[[File:God the Father with His Right Hand Raised in Blessing.jpg|thumb|240px|''God the Father with His Right Hand Raised in Blessing'', with a triangular halo representing the Trinity, [[Girolamo dai Libri]] c. 1555.]]
Prior to the 10th century no attempt was made to represent a separate depiction as a full human figure of [[God the Father]] in [[Western art]].&lt;ref name="James Cornwell page 2"/&gt; Yet, Western art eventually required some way to illustrate the presence of the Father, so through successive representations a set of artistic styles for the depiction of the Father in human form gradually emerged around the 10th century AD.

It appears that when early artists designed to represent God the Father, fear and awe restrained them from a delineation of the whole person. Typically only a small part would be represented, usually the hand, or sometimes the face, but rarely the whole person.  In many images, the figure of the Son supplants the Father, so a smaller portion of the person of the Father is depicted.&lt;ref&gt;Adolphe Napoléon Didron, 2003 ''Christian iconography: or The history of Christian art in the middle ages'' {{ISBN|0-7661-4075-X}} pages 169&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 12th century depictions of God the Father had started to appear in French [[illuminated manuscript]]s, which as a less public form could often be more adventurous in their iconography, and in [[stained glass]] church windows in England. Initially the head or bust was usually shown in some form of frame of clouds in the top of the picture space, where the Hand of God had formerly appeared; the [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]] on the famous [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège|baptismal font in Liège]] of [[Rainer of Huy]] is an example from 1118 (a Hand of God is used in another scene).  Gradually the amount of the body shown can increase to a half-length figure, then a full-length, usually enthroned, as in [[Giotto]]'s [[fresco]] of c. 1305 in [[Padua]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arena Chapel]], at the top of the triumphal arch, ''God sending out the angel of the Annunciation''. See Schiller, I, fig 15&lt;/ref&gt;   In the 14th century the [[Naples Bible]] carried a depiction of God the Father in the [[Burning bush]]. By the early 15th century, the [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]] has a considerable number of images, including an elderly but tall and elegant full-length figure walking in the [[Garden of Eden]] (gallery), which show a considerable diversity of apparent ages and dress.  The [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)#Lorenzo Ghiberti|"Gates of Paradise" of the Florence Baptistry]] by [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], begun in 1425 show a similar tall full-length Father.  The [[Rohan Book of Hours]] of about 1430 also included depictions of God the Father in half-length human form, which were now becoming standard, and the Hand of God becoming rarer.  At the same period other works, like the large Genesis [[altarpiece]] by the Hamburg painter [[Meister Bertram]], continued to use the old depiction of Christ as ''Logos'' in Genesis scenes.  In the 15th century there was a brief fashion for depicting all three persons of the Trinity as [[Trinity#Less common types of depiction|similar or identical figures with the usual appearance of Christ]].

[[File:Andrea_del_Verrocchio,_Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_Baptism_of_Christ_-_Uffizi.jpg|thumb|left|Two "''Hands of God''" (relatively unusual) and the [[Holy Spirit]] as a dove in [[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|''Baptism of Christ'', by Verrocchio]], 1472.]]
[[File:Damian. The Ancient of Days.jpg|thumb|''The Ancient of Days'', a 14th-century fresco from [[Ubisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].]]
In an early Venetian school ''[[Coronation of the Virgin]]'' by [[Giovanni d'Alemagna]] and [[Antonio Vivarini]], (c. 1443) (see gallery below) The Father is shown in the representation consistently used by other artists later, namely as a patriarch, with benign, yet powerful countenance and with long white hair and a beard, a depiction largely derived from, and justified by, the description of the [[Ancient of Days]] in the [[Old Testament]], the nearest approach to a physical description of God in the Old Testament:&lt;ref&gt;Bigham Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;. ...the Ancient of Days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. ([[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 7:9) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the ''Annunciation'' by [[Benvenuto di Giovanni]] in 1470, God the Father is portrayed in the red robe and a hat that resembles that of a Cardinal. However, even in the later part of the 15th century, the representation of the Father and the Holy Spirit as "hands and dove" continued, e.g. in [[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|Verrocchio's ''Baptism of Christ'']] in 1472.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur de Bles, 2004 ''How to Distinguish the Saints in Art by Their Costumes, Symbols and Attributes'' {{ISBN|1-4179-0870-X}} page 32&lt;/ref&gt;

In Renaissance paintings of the adoration of the Trinity, God may be depicted in two ways, either with emphasis on The Father, or the three elements of the Trinity. The most usual depiction of the Trinity in Renaissance art depicts God the Father as an old man, usually with a long beard and patriarchal in appearance, sometimes with a triangular halo (as a reference to the Trinity), or with a papal tiara, specially in Northern Renaissance painting. In these depictions The Father may hold a globe or book. He is behind and above Christ on the Cross in the [[Throne of Mercy]] iconography. A dove, the symbol of the [[Holy Spirit]] may hover above. Various people from different classes of society, e.g. kings, popes or martyrs may be present in the picture. In a Trinitarian [[Pietà]], God the Father is often shown wearing a papal dress and a papal tiara, supporting the dead Christ in his arms. They float in heaven with angels who carry the [[instruments of the Passion]].&lt;ref&gt;Irene Earls, 1987 ''Renaissance art: a topical dictionary'' {{ISBN|0-313-24658-0}} pages 8 and 283&lt;/ref&gt;

The orb, or the globe of the world, is rarely shown with the other two persons of the Trinity and is almost exclusively restricted to God the Father, but is not a definite indicator since it is sometimes used in depictions of Christ. A book, although often depicted with the Father is not an indicator of the Father and is also used with Christ.&lt;ref name="George Ferguson page 222"/&gt;

==From Renaissance to Baroque==
Representations of God the Father and the Trinity were attacked both by Protestants and within Catholicism, by the [[Jansenist]] and [[Baianist]] movements as well as more orthodox theologians.  As with other attacks on Catholic imagery, this had the effect both of reducing Church support for the less central depictions, and strengthening it for the core ones.  In the [[Western Church]], the pressure to restrain religious imagery resulted in the highly influential decrees of the final session of the [[Council of Trent]] in 1563. The Council of Trent decrees confirmed the traditional Catholic doctrine that images only represented the person depicted, and that veneration to them was paid to the person, not the image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct25.html Text of the 25th decree of the Council of Trent]&lt;/ref&gt;

Artistic depictions of God the Father were uncontroversial in Catholic art thereafter, but less common depictions of the [[Trinity]] were condemned.  In 1745 [[Pope Benedict XIV]] explicitly supported the [[Throne of Mercy]] depiction, referring to the "Ancient of Days", but in 1786 it was still necessary for [[Pope Pius VI]] to issue a [[papal bull]] condemning the decision of an Italian church council to remove all images of the Trinity from churches.&lt;ref&gt;Bigham, 73-76&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dividing Light from Darkness.jpg|thumb|302x302px|''[[Separation of Light from Darkness]]'', by [[Michelangelo]], c.first half of 1512.]]
God the Father appears in several Genesis scenes in [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], most famously ''[[The Creation of Adam]]''. God the Father is depicted as a powerful figure, floating in the clouds in ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|Titian's Assumption of the Virgin]]'' (see gallery below) in the [[Frari of Venice]], long admired as a masterpiece of [[High Renaissance]] art.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Lohr Martz, 1991 ''From Renaissance to baroque: essays on literature and art'' {{ISBN|0-8262-0796-0}} page 222&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Church of the Gesù]] in Rome includes a number of 16th-century depictions of [[God the Father]]. In some of these paintings the [[Trinity]] is still alluded to in terms of three angels, but  [[Giovanni Battista Fiammeri]] also depicted God the Father riding on a cloud, above the scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Gauvin A. Bailey, 2003 ''Between Renaissance and Baroque: Jesuit art in Rome'' {{ISBN|0-8020-3721-6}} page 233&lt;/ref&gt;

In both the ''Last Judgment'' and the ''Coronation of the Virgin'' paintings by [[Rubens]] (see gallery below) he depicted God the Father in the form that by then had become widely accepted, as a bearded patriarchal figure above the fray.  In the 17th century, the two Spanish artists [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]] (whose father-in-law [[Francisco Pacheco]] was in charge of the approval of new images for the Inquisition) and [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] both depicted God the Father as a patriarchal figure with a white beard (see gallery below) in a purple robe.

While representations of God the Father were growing in Italy, Spain, Germany and the Low Countries, there was resistance elsewhere in Europe, even during the 17th century. In 1632 most members of the [[Star Chamber]] court in England (except the [[Archbishop of York]]) condemned the use of the images of the Trinity in church windows, and some considered them illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Winston, 1847 ''An Inquiry Into the Difference of Style Observable in Ancient Glass Paintings, Especially in England'' {{ISBN|1-103-66622-3}}, (2009) page 229&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 17th century [[Sir Thomas Browne]] wrote that he considered the depiction of God the Father as an old man "a dangerous act" that might lead to Egyptian symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Thomas Browne's Works, 1852, {{ISBN|0559376871}}, 2006 page 156&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, Charles Winston was still critical of such images as a "''[[Romish|Romish trend]]''" (a term used to refer to [[Roman Catholic (term)|Roman Catholics]]) that he considered best avoided in England.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Winston, 1847 ''An Inquiry Into the Difference of Style Observable in Ancient Glass Paintings, Especially in England'' {{ISBN|1-103-66622-3}}, (2009) page 230&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1667 the 43rd chapter of the [[Moscow Sobor of 1666–1667|Great Moscow Council]] specifically included a ban on a number of depictions of God the Father and the Holy Spirit, which then also resulted in a whole range of other icons being placed on the forbidden list,&lt;ref&gt;Oleg Tarasov, 2004 ''Icon and devotion: sacred spaces in Imperial Russia'' {{ISBN|1-86189-118-0}} page 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://genuineorthodoxchurch.com/moscow_1666.htm Orthodox church web site]&lt;/ref&gt; mostly affecting Western-style depictions which had been gaining ground in Orthodox icons. The Council also declared that the person of the Trinity who was the "Ancient of Days" was Christ, as ''Logos'', not God the Father. However some icons continued to be produced in Russia, as well as [[Greece]], [[Romania]], and other Orthodox countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20411">The '''history of the social sciences''' has origin in the common stock of Western philosophy and shares various precursors, but began most intentionally in the early 19th century with the [[positivist]] [[philosophy of science]]. Since the mid-20th century, the term "[[social science]]" has come to refer more generally, not just to [[sociology]], but to all those disciplines which analyse society and culture; from [[anthropology]] to [[linguistics]] to [[media studies]].

The idea that society may be studied in a standardized and objective manner, with scholarly rules and methodology, is comparatively recent. While there is evidence of early [[sociology in medieval Islam]], and while philosophers such as [[Confucius]] had long since theorised on topics such as [[social role]]s, the scientific analysis of "Man" is peculiar to the intellectual break away from the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and toward the discourses of [[Modernity]]. Social sciences came forth from the [[moral philosophy]] of the time and was influenced by the [[Age of Revolution]]s, such as the [[Industrial revolution]] and the [[French revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Kuper and Jessica Kuper, ''The Social Science Encyclopedia'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; The beginnings of the social sciences in the 18th century are reflected in the grand encyclopedia of [[Diderot]], with articles from [[Rousseau]] and other pioneers.

Around the start of the 20th century, Enlightenment philosophy was challenged in various quarters. After the use of classical theories since the end of the scientific revolution, various fields substituted mathematics studies for experimental studies and examining equations to build a theoretical structure. The development of social science subfields became very quantitative in methodology. Conversely, the interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary nature of scientific inquiry into human behavior and social and environmental factors affecting it made many of the natural sciences interested in some aspects of social science methodology.&lt;ref name="web-miner.com"&gt;Vessuri, Hebe. (2000). "Ethical Challenges for the Social Sciences on the Threshold of the 21st Century". ''Current Sociology'' 50, no. 1 (January): 135–150. [http://www.web-miner.com/socsciethics.htm], Social Science Ethics: A Bibliography, Sharon Stoerger MLS, MBA&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of boundary blurring include emerging disciplines like social studies of medicine, [[sociobiology]], [[neuropsychology]], [[Bioeconomics (biophysical)|bioeconomics]] and the [[history of science|history]] and [[sociology of science]]. Increasingly, quantitative and qualitative methods are being integrated in the study of human action and its implications and consequences. In the first half of the 20th century, statistics became a free-standing discipline of applied mathematics. Statistical methods were used confidently.

In the contemporary period, there continues to be little movement toward consensus on what methodology might have the power and refinement to connect a proposed "grand theory" with the various midrange theories that, with considerable success, continue to provide usable frameworks for massive, growing data banks. See [[consilience]].

===Antiquity===
[[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' is an influential treatise on [[political philosophy]] and the just life.

[[Aristotle]] published several works on social organization, such as his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', and ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of the Athenians]]''.

===Islamic developments===
{{Main|Islamic sociology|Early Muslim sociology}}

Significant contributions to the social sciences were made in Medieval [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]]. [[Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī|Al-Biruni]] (973–1048) wrote detailed comparative studies on the [[anthropology]] of peoples, religions and cultures in the [[Middle East]], [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and [[South Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Walbridge (1998). "Explaining Away the Greek Gods in Islam", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' '''59''' (3), p. 389–403.&lt;/ref&gt; Biruni has also been praised by several scholars for his [[Islam]]ic anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;"Islamic Anthropology" and the "Anthropology of Islam", ''Anthropological Quarterly'' '''68''' (3), Anthropological Analysis and Islamic Texts, p. 185–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is best known for his ''[[Muqaddimah]]''.

===Modern period===

=== Early modern ===
{{Main|Age of Enlightenment}}
Near the [[Renaissance]], which began around the 14th century, Buridanus and Oresmius wrote on money. In the 15th century St. Atonine of Florence wrote of a comprehensive economic process. In the 16th century Leonard de Leys (Lessius), Juan de Lego, and particularly Luis Molina wrote on economic topics. These writers focused on explaining property as something for "public good".&lt;ref name=Schumpeter1954&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en | title = History of economic analysis | year = 1954 | pages = 70–142 |author = Schumpeter JA. | accessdate = 2009-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative figures of the 17th century include [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]], Hugo Grotius, [[Thomas Hobbes]], John Locke, and Samuel von Putendorf. Thomas Hobbes argued that [[deductive reasoning]] from [[axiom]]s created a scientific framework, and hence his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' was a scientific description of a political [[commonwealth]]. In the 18th century, social science was called moral philosophy, as contrasted from natural philosophy and mathematics, and included the study of natural theology, natural ethics, natural jurisprudence, and policy ("police"), which included economics and finance ("revenue"). Pure philosophy, logic, literature, and history were outside these two categories. [[Adam Smith]] was a professor of moral philosophy, and he was taught by [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]]. Figures of the time included [[François Quesnay]], Rousseau, [[Giambattista Vico]], [[William Godwin]], [[Gabriel Bonnet de Mably]], and [[Andre Morellet]]. The [[Encyclopédie]] of the time contained various works on the social sciences.&lt;ref name=Schumpeter1954/&gt;

=== Late modern ===
This unity of science as descriptive remains, for example, in the time of [[Thomas Hobbes]] who argued that deductive reasoning from axioms created a scientific framework, and hence his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' was a scientific description of a political commonwealth. What would happen within decades of his work was a revolution in what constituted "science", particularly the work of [[Isaac Newton]] in physics. Newton, by revolutionizing what was then called "natural philosophy", changed the basic framework by which individuals understood what was "scientific".

While he was merely the archetype of an accelerating trend, the important distinction is that for Newton, the mathematical flowed from a presumed reality independent of the observer, and working by its own rules. For philosophers of the same period, mathematical expression of philosophical ideals was taken to be symbolic of natural human relationships as well: the same laws moved physical and spiritual reality. For examples see [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]] and [[Johannes Kepler]], each of whom took mathematical examples as models for human behavior directly. In Pascal's case, the famous wager; for Leibniz, the invention of binary computation; and for Kepler, the intervention of angels to guide the planets (citation needed).

In the realm of other disciplines, this created a pressure to express ideas in the form of mathematical relationships. Such relationships, called "Laws" after the usage of the time (see [[philosophy of science]]) became the model which other disciplines would emulate.

==== 19th century ====
{{See also|History of sociology|19th century}}
The term "social science" first appeared in the 1824 book ''An Inquiry into the Principles of the Distribution of Wealth Most Conducive to Human Happiness; applied to the Newly Proposed System of Voluntary Equality of Wealth'' by [[William Thompson (philosopher)|William Thompson]] (1775–1833). [[Auguste Comte]] (1797–1857) argued that ideas pass through three rising stages, [[theological]], [[philosophical]] and [[scientific]]. He defined the difference as the first being rooted in assumption, the second in [[critical thinking]], and the third in positive observation. This framework, still rejected by many, encapsulates the thinking which was to push [[economic]] study from being a descriptive to a mathematically based discipline. [[Karl Marx]] was one of the first writers to claim that his methods of research represented a [[science|scientific]] view of history in this model. With the late 19th century, attempts to apply equations to statements about [[human behavior]] became increasingly common. Among the first were the "Laws" of [[philology]], which attempted to map the change over time of sounds in a [[language]].

Sociology was established by Comte in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Sociology,'' Article: Comte, Auguste&lt;/ref&gt; He had earlier used the term "social physics", but that had subsequently been appropriated by others, most notably the Belgian statistician [[Adolphe Quetelet]]. Comte endeavoured to unify history, psychology and economics through the scientific understanding of the social realm. Writing shortly after the malaise of the [[French Revolution]], he proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological [[positivism]], an epistemological approach outlined in ''The Course in Positive Philosophy'' [1830–1842] and ''[[A General View of Positivism]]'' (1844). Comte believed a [[Law of three stages|positivist stage]] would mark the final era, after conjectural [[theological]] and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] phases, in the progression of human understanding.&lt;ref name="comte"&gt;''Dictionary of the Social Sciences'', Article: Comte, Auguste&lt;/ref&gt;

It was with the work of [[Charles Darwin]] that the descriptive version of [[social theory]] received another shock. [[Biology]] had, seemingly, resisted mathematical study, and yet the [[Natural Selection|theory of natural selection]] and the implied idea of [[genetic inheritance]]—later found to have been enunciated by [[Gregor Mendel]], seemed to point in the direction of a scientific biology based, like [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], on mathematical relationships. In the first half of the 20th century, [[statistics]] became a free-standing discipline of [[applied mathematics]]. Statistical methods were used confidently, for example in an increasingly statistical view of [[biology]]. The first thinkers to attempt to combine inquiry of the type they saw in Darwin with exploration of human relationships, which, evolutionary theory implied, would be based on selective forces, were [[Freud]] in Austria and [[William James]] in the United States. Freud's theory of the functioning of the mind, and James' work on experimental psychology would have enormous impact on those that followed. Freud, in particular, created a framework which would appeal not only to those studying psychology, but artists and writers as well.

Though Comte is generally regarded as the "Father of Sociology",&lt;ref name="comte"/&gt; the discipline was formally established by another French thinker, [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917), who developed positivism in greater detail. Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1895, publishing his ''[[Rules of the Sociological Method]]''. In 1896, he established the journal ''[[Année Sociologique|L'Année Sociologique]]''. Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a case study of suicide rates among [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations, distinguished sociological analysis from [[psychology]] or [[philosophy]]. It also marked a major contribution to the concept of [[structural functionalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Gianfranco Poggi (2000). ''Durkheim.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press. Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Durkheim, Marx and [[Max Weber]] are typically cited as the three principal architects of social science in the ''science of society'' sense of the term.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weber/ "Max Weber". ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; "Social science", however, has since become an umbrella term to describe all those disciplines, outside of physical science and art, which analyse human societies.

==== 20th century ====
{{See also|20th century}}
In the first half of the 20th century, [[statistics]] became a free-standing discipline of [[applied mathematics]]. Statistical methods were used confidently, for example in an increasingly statistical view of biology.

The first thinkers to attempt to combine inquiry of the type they saw in Darwin with exploration of human relationships, which, [[evolution]]ary theory implied, would be based on selective forces, were [[Freud]] in Austria and [[William James]] in the [[United States]]. Freud's theory of the functioning of the [[mind]], and James' work on experimental [[psychology]] would have enormous impact on those that followed. Freud, in particular, created a framework which would appeal not only to those studying psychology, but artists and writers as well.

One of the most persuasive advocates for the view of scientific treatment of philosophy would be [[John Dewey]] (1859–1952). He began, as Marx did, in an attempt to weld [[Hegelian]] [[idealism]] and [[logic]] to experimental science, for example in his ''Psychology'' of 1887. However, he abandoned Hegelian constructs. Influenced by both [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[William James]], he joined the movement in America called [[pragmatism]]. He then formulated his basic doctrine, enunciated in essays such as "The Influence of Darwin on Philosophy" (1910).

This idea, based on his theory of how [[organism]]s respond, states that there are three phases to the process of inquiry:
# Problematic Situation, where the typical response is inadequate.
# Isolation of Data or subject matter.
# Reflective, which is tested empirically.

With the rise of the idea of quantitative measurement in the physical sciences, for example [[Lord Rutherford]]'s famous maxim that any knowledge that one cannot measure numerically "is a poor sort of knowledge", the stage was set for the conception of the humanities as being precursors to "social science."

This change was not, and is not, without its detractors, both inside of academia and outside. The range of critiques begin from those who believe that the [[physical sciences]] are qualitatively different from social sciences,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} through those who do not believe in statistical science of any kind,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} through those who disagree with the [[methodology]] and kinds of conclusion of social science,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} to those who believe the entire framework of scientificizing these disciplines is mostly from a desire for prestige.

In 1924, prominent social scientists established the [[Pi Gamma Mu]] honor society for the social sciences. Among its key objectives were to promote interdisciplinary cooperation and develop an integrated theory of human personality and organization. Toward these ends, a journal for interdisciplinary scholarship in the various social sciences and lectureship grants were established.

==== Interwar period ====
[[Theodore Porter]] argued in ''The Rise of Statistical Thinking'' that the effort to provide a synthetic social science is a matter of both administration and discovery combined, and that the rise of social science was, therefore, marked by both pragmatic needs as much as by theoretical purity. An example of this is the rise of the concept of [[IQ|Intelligence Quotient]], or IQ. It is unclear precisely what is being measured by IQ, but the measurement is useful in that it predicts success in various endeavors.

The rise of [[industrialism]] had created a series of [[social]], [[economic]], and [[political]] problems, particularly in managing supply and demand in their political economy, the [[Resource management|management of resources]] for [[military]] and developmental use, the creation of mass [[education system]]s to train individuals in symbolic reasoning and problems in managing the effects of [[industrialization]] itself. The perceived senselessness of the "Great War" as it was then called, of 1914–18, now called [[World War I]], based in what were perceived to be "emotional" and "irrational" decisions, provided an immediate impetus for a form of decision making that was more "scientific" and easier to manage. Simply put, to manage the new multi-national enterprises, private and governmental, required more data. More data required a means of reducing it to information upon which to make decisions. Numbers and charts could be interpreted more quickly and moved more efficiently than long texts. Conversely, the interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary nature of scientific inquiry into human behavior and social and environmental factors affecting it have made many of the so-called hard sciences dependent on social science methodology. Examples of boundary blurring include emerging disciplines like social studies of [[medicine]], [[neuropsychology]], [[Bioeconomics (biophysical)|bioeconomics]] and the history and sociology of science. Increasingly, quantitative and qualitative methods are being integrated in the study of human action and its implications and consequences.

In the 1930s this new model of managing decision making became cemented with the [[New Deal]] in the US, and in Europe with the increasing need to manage industrial production and governmental affairs. Institutions such as [[The New School for Social Research]], [[International Institute of Social History]], and departments of "social research" at prestigious universities were meant to fill the growing demand for individuals who could quantify human interactions and produce models for decision making on this basis.

Coupled with this pragmatic need was the belief that the clarity and simplicity of mathematical expression avoided systematic errors of holistic thinking and logic rooted in traditional argument. This trend, part of the larger movement known as [[modernism]] provided the rhetorical edge for the expansion of social sciences.

=== Contemporary developments ===
There continues to be little movement toward consensus on what methodology might have the power and refinement to connect a proposed "grand theory" with the various midrange theories which, with considerable success, continue to provide usable frameworks for massive, growing data banks (see [[consilience]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwp.uni-linz.ac.at/lxe/sektktf/gg/GeertzTexts/Empowering_Aristotle.htm Clifford Geertz, "Empowering Aristotle", ''Science'', vol. 293, July 6, 2001, p. 53.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531195118/http://www.iwp.uni-linz.ac.at/lxe/sektktf/gg/GeertzTexts/Empowering_Aristotle.htm |date=May 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The institute was established by Karachi University's Department of Mathematics in 1994.&lt;ref name="Faiza Illyas of Dawn Newspapers, Dawn Media Group"&gt;{{Cite web

  | doi = 
  | accessdate = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established as an autonomous research institute with the idea for a space science astrophysics programme and an astronomical observatory was conceived right at the inception of the Karachi University.&lt;ref name="Faiza Illyas of Dawn Newspapers, Dawn Media Group"/&gt; However, the trace of establishing such institute came in place in 1960, when Professor A.B.A Haleem, Professor of Political Science and Vice-Chancellor of the Karachi University, first obtained and procured the powerful astronomical telescope with relevant equipment from a West-German company.&lt;ref name="Faiza Illyas of Dawn Newspapers, Dawn Media Group"/&gt; Known as [[KU Observatory|Karachi University Astrophysics Observatory]], an astronomical observatory was initiated under the administrative supervision of the Department of Mathematics of the Karachi University.&lt;ref name="Faiza Illyas of Dawn Newspapers, Dawn Media Group"/&gt; Later in time, the Federal [[Government of Pakistan]] built a building to install the observatory which initially belonged to the Department of Mathematics.&lt;ref name="Faiza Illyas of Dawn Newspapers, Dawn Media Group"/&gt; In 1994, the building and the observatory became a part of the ISPA with Prof. Dr. Jawaid Quamar as its first founding director.&lt;ref name="Faiza Illyas of Dawn Newspapers, Dawn Media Group"/&gt;

Prof. Dr. Jawaid Quamar is credited for leading the institute at an academic and international level as he had attracted many students to do their research under his supervision and he also introduced new programmes in the relevant field in the country. The new metallic dome of the observatory was an evidence of Dr. Quamar’s hard work and dedication.

Later, after the retirement of Dr. Quamar, Mr. M. Shahid Qureshi took charge of the institute in 2002. He regularized the academic programs at ISPA and lead the institute till 2010. Mr Qureshi earned his PhD from the same institute under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Nasiruddin Khan (of department of Mathematics, UOK). In Fact Dr. Qureshi was the third PhD of the institute, first being Prof. Dr. M. Ayub Khan Yousufzai, second Prof. Dr. M. Jawed Iqbal (the current Director of ISPA).

On June 4, 2015, a brief inaugural session took place at ISPA where, Prof. Dr. Jawaid Quamar inaugurate the ISPA Seminar Library in the memory of "Prof. Dr. Irshad Ahmed Khan Afridi", who was involved in the foundation of ISPA. The new name of ISPA seminar library (Dr. Irshad Ahmed Khan Afridi Seminar Library) was approved by the Syndicate of Karachi University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jogss.org/conference/Abstracts%20Booklet%20of%203rd%20National%20Conference%2001-10-2015.pdf|title=Inaugrial of Dr. Irshad Ahmed Khan Afridi Seminar Library, University of Karachi|last=|first=|date=31 May 2017|website=|publisher=Institute of Space &amp; Planetary Astrophysics (ISPA), University of Karachi|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''instrumental temperature record''' provides the [[temperature]] of Earth's [[climate|climate system]] from the historical network of [[in situ]] measurements of surface air temperatures and ocean surface temperatures. Data are collected at thousands of meteorological stations, buoys and ships around the globe. The longest-running temperature record is the [[Central England temperature]] data series, which starts in 1659. The longest-running quasi-global record starts in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brohan, P., J.J. Kennedy, I. Harris, S.F.B. Tett, P.D.

== Total warming and trends ==

The global average and combined land and ocean surface temperature, show a warming of 0.85 [0.65 to 1.06] °C, in the period 1880 to 2012, based on multiple independently produced datasets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=IPCC AR5|title=Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis, IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (WGI AR5)|url=[http://www.climatechange2013.org/ WGI AR5]  [http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_ALL_FINAL.pdf Full Report PDF, p.5]|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives a trend of 0.064 ± 0.015&amp;nbsp;°C per decade over that period. The trend is faster for land than ocean, faster for Arctic regions, and faster since the 1970s than the longer period.

=== Warming in the instrumental temperature record ===

Most of the observed warming occurred in two periods: around 1900 to around 1940 and around 1970 onwards;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter02_FINAL.pdf IPCC AR5 Chapter 2 page 193]&lt;/ref&gt; the cooling/plateau from 1940 to 1970 has been mostly attributed to [[Sulfate#Environmental effects|sulphate aerosol]].&lt;ref&gt;

Attribution of the temperature change to natural or anthropogenic (i.e., [[Anthropogenic climate change|human-induced]]) factors is an important question: see [[global warming]] and [[attribution of recent climate change]].

Land air temperatures are rising faster than sea surface temperatures. Over 1979 to 2012 the trend for land was about 0.254 ± 0.050&amp;nbsp;°C per decade per CruTemp4 or 0.273 ± 0.047 per GHCN while the trend for sea surface temperatures is about 0.072 ± 0.024&amp;nbsp;°C per decade per HadISST to 0.124 ± 0.030&amp;nbsp;°C per decade per HadSST3.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter02_FINAL.pdf IPCC AR5 WG1 Chapter 2 page 187 and page 192]&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1979 to 2012, the linear warming trend for combined land and sea temperatures has been 0.155&amp;nbsp;°C [0.122 to 0.188&amp;nbsp;°C] per decade according to AR5.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter02_FINAL.pdf IPCC AR5 WG1 Chapter 2 p193]&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report found that the instrumental temperature record for the past century included urban heat island effects but that these were primarily local, having a negligible influence on global temperature trends (less than 0.006&amp;nbsp;°C per decade over land and zero over the oceans).&lt;ref name="trenberth summary of observations"&gt;

==Influences on global temperature==

{{Main article|Global warming|Attribution of recent climate change}}

[[Greenhouse gas]]es trap outgoing radiation warming the atmosphere which in turn warms the land.

[[El Niño]] generally tends to increase global temperatures. [[La Niña]], on the other hand, usually causes years which are cooler than the short-term average.&lt;ref name="NOAA"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/2014/13 | title = NOAA National Climatic Data Center, State of the Climate: Global Analysis for Annual 2014 | accessdate = 2015-01-21 | publisher = [[NOAA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Niño is the warm phase of the [[El Niño Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) and La Niña the cold phase.

[[Aerosols]] diffuse incoming radiation generally cooling the planet. Volcanoes are the largest source but there are also anthropogenic sources. There are several other effects such as clouds. Some aerosols like carbon black have warming effects.

[[Land use]] change like deforestation can increase greenhouse gases through burning [[biomass]]. [[Albedo]] can also be changed.

[[Solar irradiance|Incoming solar radiation]] varies very slightly, with the main variation controlled by the approximately 11-year [[Solar cycle|solar magnetic activity cycle]].

==Absolute temperatures v. anomalies==

Records of global average surface temperature are usually presented as [[:wikt:anomaly|anomalies]] rather than as absolute temperatures. A temperature anomaly is measured against a reference value or long-term average.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if the reference value is 15&amp;nbsp;°C, and the measured temperature is 17&amp;nbsp;°C, then the temperature anomaly is +2&amp;nbsp;°C (i.e., 17&amp;nbsp;°C −15&amp;nbsp;°C).

Temperature anomalies are useful for deriving average surface temperatures because they tend to be highly correlated over large distances (of the order of 1000&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, anomalies are representative of temperature changes over large areas and distances. By comparison, absolute temperatures vary markedly over even short distances.

The Earth's average surface absolute temperature for the 1961–1990 period has been derived by spatial interpolation of average observed near-surface air temperatures from over the land, oceans and sea ice regions, with a best estimate of 14&amp;nbsp;°C (57.2&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name="jonesreview"&gt;
{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones PD, New M, Parker DE, Martin S, Rigor IG |date=1999 |title=Surface air temperature and its changes over the past 150 years |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1029/1999RG900002/abstract |journal=Reviews of Geophysics |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=173–199 |doi=10.1029/1999RG900002 |bibcode=1999RvGeo..37..173J }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The estimate is uncertain, but probably lies within 0.5&amp;nbsp;°C of the true value.&lt;ref name="jonesreview" /&gt; Given the difference in uncertainties between this absolute value and any annual anomaly, it's not valid to add them together to imply a precise absolute value for a specific year.&lt;ref&gt;http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/abs_temp.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global record from 1850 ==

The period for which reasonably reliable instrumental records of near-surface temperature exist with quasi-global coverage is generally considered to begin around 1850. Earlier records exist, but with sparser coverage and less standardized instrumentation.

The temperature data for the record come from measurements from land stations and ships. On land, temperature sensors are kept in a [[Stevenson screen]] or a [[MMTS (meteorology)|maximum minimum temperature system]] (MMTS). The sea record consists of surface ships taking sea temperature measurements from engine inlets or buckets. The land and marine records can be compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/fig2-6.htm | title=Climate Change 2001: Working Group I: The Scientific Basis – Figure 2.6 | publisher=[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] | author=[[John T.

Most meteorological observations are taken for use in weather forecasts. Centers such as [[European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts|ECMWF]] show [http://www.ecmwf.int/products/forecasts/d/overview/monitoring/coverage/dcover!ssmi!00!pop!od!oper!w_coverage!latest!obs/ instantaneous map of their coverage]; or the Hadley Centre show the coverage for the [http://www.meto.gov.uk/research/hadleycentre/CR_data/Annual/HadCRUTanm_2000.gif average of the year 2000]. Coverage for earlier in the 20th and 19th centuries would be significantly less. While temperature changes vary both in size and direction from one location to another, the numbers from different locations are combined to produce an estimate of a global average change.

This view ignores the presence of internal climate variability.&lt;ref name="scott variability p1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="met office internal variability"/&gt; Internal climate variability is a result of complex interactions between components of the climate system, such as the [[coupling (physics)|coupling]] between the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] and [[ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1997–98 El Niño event|El Niño in 1998]] was particularly strong, possibly one of the strongest of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="scott variability p1"/&gt;

Cooling between 2006 and 2008, for instance, was likely driven by La Niña, the opposite of El Niño conditions.&lt;ref name="scott variability p3"&gt;Edited quote from public-domain source: {{Cite journal

Temperature trends from 1901 are positive over most of the world's surface except for Atlantic Ocean south of Greenland, the [[southeastern United States]], and parts of [[Bolivia]]. Warming is strongest over inland areas in Asia and North America as well as south-eastern Brazil and some areas in the South Atlantic and Indian oceans.

Since 1979 temperature increase is considerably stronger over land while cooling has been observed over some oceanic regions in the Pacific Ocean and Southern Hemisphere; the spatial pattern of ocean temperature trend in those regions is possibly related to the [[Pacific Decadal Oscillation]] and [[Antarctic oscillation|Southern Annular Mode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter3.pdf|format=PDF|title=IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, Chapter 3|accessdate=2009-03-14|date=2007-02-05|pages=250–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seasonal temperature trends are positive over most of the globe but weak cooling is observed over the mid latitudes of the southern ocean but also over eastern Canada in spring because of strengthening of the [[North Atlantic Oscillation]]. Warming is stronger over northern Europe, China and North America in winter, Europe and Asia interior in spring, Europe and north Africa in summer and northern North America, Greenland and eastern Asia in autumn.
Enhanced warming over north Eurasia is partly linked to the [[Arctic oscillation|Northern Annular Mode]],&lt;ref name="Polyakov 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Polyakov |first=I.V. |first2=R.V. |last2=Bekryaev |first3=U.S. |last3=Bhatt |first4=R.L. |last4=Colony |first5=A.P. |last5=Maskshtas |first6=D. |last6=Walsh |first7=R.V. |last7=Bekryaev |first8=G.V. |last8=Alekseev |year=2003 |title=Variability and trends of air temperature in the Maritime Arctic |journal=J.

The most recent climate model simulations give a range of results for changes in global-average temperature. Some models show more warming in the troposphere than at the surface, while a slightly smaller number of simulations show the opposite behaviour. There is no fundamental inconsistency among these model results and observations at the global scale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/tmlw0602.pdf Temperature Trends in the Lower Atmosphere – Understanding and Reconciling Differences]&lt;/ref&gt;

The satellite records used to show much smaller warming trends for the troposphere which were considered to disagree with model prediction; however, following revisions to the satellite records, the trends are now similar.

The IPCC fifth assessment report concluded "assessment of the large body of studies comparing various long-term radiosonde and MSU products since AR4 is hampered by data set version changes, and inherent data uncertainties. These factors substantially limit the ability to draw robust and consistent inferences from such studies about the true long-term trends or the value of different data products".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter02_FINAL.pdf IPCC 5AR WG1 Chapter 2 page 196]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{third-party|date=November 2015}}
'''Ishikism''', [pron: 'Ishik-ism] ({{lang-tr|Işıkçılık}}) or '''Ishik Alevism''' (''{{lang|tr|Işık Aleviliği}}''), also known as '''Chinarism''' (''{{lang|tr|Çınarcılık}}''), is a [[new religious movement|new]] [[syncretism|syncretic]] religious movement among [[Alevism|Alevis]] who have developed an alternative understanding of [[Alevism]] and its history. These alternative interpretations and beliefs were inspired by Turkish writer Erdoğan Çınar with the publication of his book ''Aleviliğin Gizli Tarihi'' (''The Secret History of Alevism'') in 2004.

==Işık faith==
While mainstream Alevis believe the term ''"Alevi"'' means  "follower of [[Ali]]", as in the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word [[‘Alawī]] (علوي), and consider themselves followers of the teachings and practices of 13th-century Alevi saint [[Haji Bektash Veli]], Ishik believe differently. The Ishik movement claim that the term "Alevi" is derived from the old [[Anatolia]]n [[Luvians]], claiming that the word "Luvi" means "People of light" in the [[Hittite language]]. Some [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] documents from the 16th century refer to the ancestors of today's Alevis as "Işık Taifesi", meaning "People of Light". This is, according to Ishikīs, a proof of the connection between the Luvians and Alevis.

The Ishik Alevis have been likened to the Kurdish [[Yezidi]]s, as part of a wider monotheistic tradition called [[Yazdanism]].  A shared cultural history of that nature relates to common folklore describing the invention of agriculture by plant domestication.  Wheat is assumed to have been first cultured in the northern part of the Middle East; and likewise, regional peoples shared a culinary tradition in the types of vegetables they consume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pieroni | first1 = Andrea | first2 = Hiwa M. | last2 = Ahmed | first3 = Hawre | last3 = Zahir| title = The spring has arrived: traditional wild vegetables gathered by Yarsanis (Ahl-e Haqq) and Sunni Muslims in Western Hawraman, SE Kurdistan, Iraq | journal = history | volume = 86| issue =1 | year = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-image===
Ishikīs consider themselves to be [[Esotericism|esotericists]], claiming that Alevism is Esotericism itself, meaning that they identify themselves with every type of esotericism in history (e.g. [[Jewish]] esotericists, [[Christian]] esotericists, [[Islam]]ic and [[Pagan]] esotericism etc.)

They claim that [[Alevism]] is the oldest religion in the world, that has changed shapes throughout time. This "First and True Religion" of the world, is claimed to have been the main source for all other religions and beliefs in the world:

{{quote|It has now been brought into the open with all its truth, that Alevism, with its tens of thousands of years of history, has influenced all beliefs and has been the Original Source (the so-called "Serçeşme" - meaning "Beginning Spot of Fountain") of the celestial religions.| Erdoğan Çınar in: ''Aleviliğin Gizli Tarihi'', 2004.&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|tr|Aleviliğin, on binlerce yıllık geçmişten gelen, bütün inanışları etkilemiş, semavi dinlere başlangıç oluşturmuş asıl kaynak, "Serçeşme", olduğunu bütün gerçekliğiyle ortaya çıkartıyor.}}" in: {{harvnb|Çınar|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Ishikīs also claim that the religious ceremonies practiced by [[Alevis]] were practiced as early as by the [[Hittites]] and even by the [[Sumer]]ians. According to Ishikīs, medieval [[Christian]] sects as [[Paulicianism]], [[Bogomilism]] etc. were also [[Alevis]]. A good example of this belief can be found in the translation of the book ''The Cathars: The Most Successful Heresy of the Middle Ages''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Sean Martin (writer and director)|Sean Martin]]|title=The Cathars: The Most Successful Heresy of the Middle Ages |year=2005 |publisher=Pocket Essentials}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2005) by [[Sean Martin (writer and director)|Sean Martin]]. Even though the original [[English language|English]] version does not contain the word "Alevi", the Turkish translator has translated the title of the book as ''Ortaçağ'da Avrupa'da Alevi Hareketi - Katharlar'' (An Alevi Movement in The Middle Ages – The Cathars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sean Martin |title=Ortaçağ'da Avrupa'da Alevi Hareketi – Katharlar |trans-title=An Alevi Movement in The Middle Ages – The Cathars |year=2005 |publisher=Kalkedon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical beliefs===
Compared to traditional [[Alevism]], the most striking differences of the Ishik movement are their interpretation of history. The Ishik movement claims that [[Alevis]] have changed their apparent identity several times in history in order to survive. According to Ishikī belief, [[heretic]] sects like the Paulicians and Bogomils were actually [[Alevis]] compelled to appear as [[Christian]]s because of the [[Byzantine]] oppression. Likewise the modern [[Alevis]] have gained an Islamic appearance because of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] oppression.

Ishikī thought is convinced that most [[heterodox]] groups are inventions as a result of oppression, meaning that groups like the [[Nizārī Ismā'īlī]], [[Bektashism and folk religion|Bektashism]], [[Ibn Nusayr|Nusayrī]] [[Alawism]], [[Ghulāt]] and [[Ahl-e Haqq]] are in reality separate from real [[Islam]].
 	
==Criticism==
The Ishikī versus Traditionalist split has caused a deep gap in [[Alevi]] society. This is the first time in centuries that [[Alevis]] have experienced such a great split in terms of beliefs.

*Traditionalist [[Alevis]] have strongly opposed the Ishikīs, who they consider as people who are creating a completely new religion, or sometimes as undercover agents, trying to disrupt [[Alevi]] unity. Ishikīs are also criticized for being extremely political and for abandoning fundamental [[Alevi]] sources, such as the [[Buyruks]], one of the most known written source among [[Alevis]].
*The Alevi historian, Hamza Aksüt, responded to the works of Erdoğan Çınar in several articles, criticizing him for being intentionally manipulative and highly conspirational. were officially given as a reply to the interview with Erdoğan Çınar: ''Çınar'dan uyarı: 'Her flörtün sonu evlilikle bitmez''' (Notice from Çınar: 'Not all flirts end with marriage').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hamza Aksüt |title=Çınar'dan uyarı: 'Her flörtün sonu evlilikle bitmez' |publisher=renkhaber |date=9 March 2009 |url=http://www.renkhaber.com/haberler/Roportaj.56/Cinar_dan_uyari___Her_flortun_sonu_evlilikle_bitmez_/8270.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319080118/http://www.renkhaber.com/haberler/Roportaj.56/Cinar_dan_uyari___Her_flortun_sonu_evlilikle_bitmez_/8270.html |archivedate=19 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another writer, Ünsal Öztürk has also criticized Erdoğan Çınar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ünsal Öztürk |title=Yazın hayatının tanımadığı bir facia: Erdoğan Çınar |publisher=renkhaber |date=10 March 2009 |url=http://www.renkhaber.com/haberler/Yorum_Analiz.39/Yazin_hayatinin_tanimadigi_bir_facia__Erdogan_Cinar/8316.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121042710/http://www.renkhaber.com/haberler/Yorum_Analiz.39/Yazin_hayatinin_tanimadigi_bir_facia__Erdogan_Cinar/8316.html |archivedate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Hamza Aksüt, Hasan Harmancı and Ünsal Öztürk went together in publishing the book ''Alevi Tarih Yazımında Skandal – Erdoğan Çınar Örneği'' (A Scandal in Alevi History Writing – The Erdoğan Çınar Example), which is an analysis and explaining of the claimed manipulation and "tampering"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harmancı |first=Hamza |title=Alevi Tarih Yazımında Skandal |publisher=Yurt Kitap Yayın |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; made by Erdoğan Çınar.
*''Erdoğan Çınar'' received lots of criticism from [[Alevi]]s and Alevi [[Dede (religious figure)|Dedes]] (for example Baki Güngör dede&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|3G5xw_AD8WM}}&lt;/ref&gt;), who claim that Çınar's book is full of misconceptions and contradictions and consider it as yet another attempt of ''"Yol-Yezidiler" (enemies of the path of their tariqa)'' to assimilate the [[Alevi]]s and to separate them from the mystic teachings of [[Haji Bektash Veli]], [[Pir Sultan Abdal]], [[Yunus Emre]] and [[The Twelve Imams]].
*Some traditionalists have even gone so far as to demand that Ishikī dedes like ''Hasan Kılavuz'' should get the penalty of social exclusion which in reality does not correspond with the actual welcoming nature of Alevisim.

==Ishikī Dedes==
Even though most [[dedes]] are still traditionalists, some of them have eventually adopted Ishikī thought. The first dedes who openly declared their non-traditionalist beliefs were Ali Haydar Cilasun, with the publication of his book ''Alevilik Bir Sır Değildir'' (Alevism is Not a Secret) in 1995, and Hasan Kılavuz in 2003. The latter is now one of the prominent figures in the Alevi Confederation of Europe (AABK) and its television channel YOL TV.

==Ishikī organizations==
The Ishik movement have succeeded in becoming very influential in important and powerful [[Alevi]] organizations.{{dubious|date=November 2015}} The Alevi Confederation of Europe (AABK) for instance, has abandoned its traditional Alevi beliefs in 2006, which it replaced with a marginal Ishikī type{{Original research inline|date=November 2015}} of understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AABF ve AABK yeni proğram değişikliği ile Aleviliği kuşa çevirmeye devam ediyor! |publisher=Alevi Yolu |date=15 January 2007 |url=http://www.aleviyolu.net/15-01-2007/aabf-ve-aabk-yeni-program-degisikligi-ile-aleviligi-kusa-cevirmeye-devam-ediyor.html

The '''Master of Accountancy''' ('''M.Acc.''' or '''M.Acy.'''), alternatively '''Master of Science in Accountancy''' ('''M.S.Acy.''') or '''Master of Professional Accountancy''' ('''M.P.Acy.''') is a graduate [[professional degree]] designed to prepare students for public accounting and to provide them with the 150 credit hours of classroom, but mostly clinical hours, required by most states before taking the [[Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination]]. 

Similar graduate programs exist in [[Canada]], where certain [[universities in Canada|universities]] such as [[University of Waterloo]]'s [[University of Waterloo School of Accounting and Finance|School of Accounting and Finance]], or [[Carleton University]]'s [[Sprott School of Business]], offer the MAcc and waive all education requirements up until the [[Uniform Evaluation|Common Final Examination]] (CFE) in order to become a [[Chartered Professional Accountant|Canadian CPA]]. 

A Master of Professional Accounting can also be obtained from [[Australia|Australian]] universities to qualify for the [[CPA Australia|Australian CPA]], [[Institute of Public Accountants|IPA]] or [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia|CA]].

This specialty program usually runs one to two years in length and contains from ten to twelve three semester credit courses (30 to 36 semester hours total). The program may consist of all graduate accounting courses or a combination of graduate accounting courses, graduate management, tax, leadership and other graduate business electives. The program is designed to not only prepare students for the CPA examination but also to provide a strong knowledge of accounting principles and business applications. 

Graduates entering corporate accounting or [[consulting firm|consulting]] often additionally (alternatively) pursue the [[Certified Management Accountant]] (CMA), [[Certified Internal Auditor]] (CIA) or other certifications.  

Note that in other countries, the degree's purpose may differ.  Where the [[Bachelor of Accountancy]] is the prerequisite for professional practice, for example in [[South Africa]], the Master of Accountancy then comprises specialized [[coursework]] in a [[Accounting#Topics|specific area of accountancy]] ([[Computer-aided audit tools|computer auditing]], taxation...), as opposed to CPA preparation as above. It may also be offered as a research based program,&lt;ref&gt; For example: [http://econ.ufs.ac.za/content.aspx?id=176 Free State University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129153153/http://econ.ufs.ac.za/content.aspx?id=176 |date=2014-11-29 }}, [http://academic.sun.ac.za/accounting/prospective.html Stellenbosch University], [http://www.unisa.ac.za/qualificationsMD/index.asp?link=http://www.unisa.ac.za/qualificationsMD/qualifications/98656.html UNISA] .&lt;/ref&gt; granting access to doctoral programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5740">'''Master of Commerce''' ('''MCom''' or '''M Comm'''; sometimes ''[[Magister (degree)|Magister]] Commercii'') is a [[postgraduate]] [[master's degree]] focusing on  [[commerce]]-, [[accounting]]-, [[management]]- and [[economics]]-related subjects. Like the undergraduate [[Bachelor of Commerce]], the degree is offered in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations.

The Master of Commerce typically requires two years of full-time study.  The [[Curriculum of the Waldorf schools|&lt;u&gt;curriculum&lt;/u&gt;]] is generally concentrated on one subject area, see aside, and emphasizes underlying [[theory]]. Relatedly, programs usually include a [[thesis]] component,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120125035948/http://www.wits.ac.za/academic/clm/sebs/newsebswebsite/postgraduateprogrammes/14707/masters_amp%3B_phd.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and may be exclusively research based.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100124080827/http://www.ucc.ie/en/study/postgrad/research/masters/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131212232222/http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&amp;ContentID=26738]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessandeconomics.mq.edu.au/postgraduate_coursework_programs/master_of_commerce |title=Master of Commerce |website=Macquarie University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given this structure, the MCom differs from other business and management degrees: 
*Its concentration on one area distinguishes it from generalist degrees, such as the [[MBA]]. Some universities offer the MCom in [[management|general management]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150124141612/http://www.uj.ac.za/EN/Faculties/management/departments/bit/coursesandprogrammes/Postgraduate/Documents/MCOM%20BROCHURE%20AND%20APPLICATION%20FORM.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; although this is more similar to the [[Master of Management]] than to the MBA;&lt;ref name="financialmail1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090924015943/http://secure.financialmail.co.za/09/0918/cover/coverstory.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  see also [[Master of Business]]. 
*As compared to specialised [[Professional degree]]s - such as the [[Master of Science in Finance]] or [[Master of Accounting]] - the MCom places more emphasis on theory; see also [[Master of Science in Management]]. 

Admission to the MCom usually requires completion of a [[Bachelor of Commerce]], or similar compatible degree; often, an [[Honours Bachelor of Commerce|"Honours degree"]] will be required.  Depending on the degree focus, a related undergraduate major and / or a fairly strong quantitative background may also be a prerequisite.  Some MCom programs admit students from science or [[engineering]] backgrounds - these programs usually require that students complete a bridging course, &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110509063150/http://www.uj.ac.za/EN/Faculties/management/departments/infoman/coursesandprogrammes/Postgraduate/Pages/MComBusManIKM.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; or undertake an extended program.&lt;ref name="uq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uq.edu.au/study/program.html?acad_prog=5165 |title=Master of Commerce |website=The University of Queensland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Matthew Pilkington''' (1701–1774), [[Church of Ireland]] priest, writer, and art historian, was the author of a standard text on painters that became known as ''Pilkington's Dictionary''. His first wife was the poet and memoirist [[Laetitia Pilkington]] and their second son was the singer and writer [[John Carteret Pilkington]].

==Career==
Born in 1701 in [[County Offaly|King's County]], his parents were William Pilkington, originally a watchmaker who later kept a Dublin alehouse and died in 1748, and his wife Alice, who died in 1749. He entered [[Trinity College, Dublin]], where he was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College, Dublin|elected a Scholar]] in 1721 and graduated [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1722, and was ordained a [[deacon]] in the Church of Ireland in 1723. By 1725, when he qualified for an [[Master of Arts|MA]], he was a [[reader (liturgy)|reader]] in [[St Andrew's Church, Dublin (Church of Ireland)|St Andrew's Church, Dublin]] and was courting a parishioner, Laetitia van Lewen. The pair married on 31 May and both became friends of [[Jonathan Swift]], the [[Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin]], who encouraged their gifts for poetry and satire and introduced them to other Irish literary figures such as [[Mary Barber (poet)|Mary Barber]], [[Constantia Grierson]] and [[Patrick Delany (theologian)|Patrick Delany]].&lt;ref name = "Elias"&gt;{{cite book|first = A.C.|last = Elias, Jr.|article= Pilkington, Matthew (1701–1774) |title = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (subscription or UK public library membership required)|year= 2004|url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22276|access-date = 14 September 2014|publisher= Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through Swift's influence, Matthew obtained the post of chaplain to the [[Lord Mayor of London]] in 1732 and, leaving Laetitia in Dublin, mixed with leading figures on the English theatrical and literary scene, including [[Alexander Pope]]. However, he also antagonised influential people and was imprisoned in 1734. Going quietly back to Dublin after his release, he had lost the support of most Irish literary figures, including Swift, and instead associated with such characters as the rascally painter [[James Worsdale]] and [[Edward Walpole]], the prime minister's dissolute son. There followed a very public rupture with Laetitia, ending in an [[ecclesiastical court|ecclesiastical]] divorce in 1738 that left him as the supposed innocent party with custody of their children.&lt;ref name = "Elias"/&gt;

Though living in Dublin, he then obtained church posts in villages outside and devoted himself to art history. In this endeavour he enjoyed the continued support of [[Charles Cobbe]], [[Archbishop of Dublin]] from 1743 to 1765, and then of his son Thomas Cobbe, acting as their secretary and using his knowledge of paintings to help build their collection at [[Newbridge Estate|Newbridge House]]. Despite a modest income, he also acquired some significant works for himself. In 1770 he saw published the major work for which he is remembered: ''The Gentleman's and Connoisseur's Dictionary of Painters''. He died in Dublin on 18 July 1774, his second wife living on until 1785.&lt;ref name = "Elias"/&gt;

==Family==
His first wife Laetitia van Lewen, born about 1709 in [[County Cork|Cork]] and like him diminutive, was the eldest child of a prominent Dublin obstetrician, Dr John van Lewen. Three of their children died in infancy and the later life of their daughter Betty is unclear. Of the two surviving sons, William the elder became a Church of Ireland clergyman holding rural livings, while Jack (John Carteret Pilkington) had a short but colourful career as singer, soldier, actor and writer in Ireland and in England.&lt;ref name = "Elias"/&gt; Jack was an ancestor of [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st_Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]].

After divorcing Laetitia in 1738, Matthew took Nancy Sandes as his mistress, marrying her on 27 Aug 1750 less than a month after Laetitia's death. Neither of the two children they had survived infancy. In his will of 14 Feb 1754, since destroyed, though he owned houses he had inherited from his parents and valuable artworks, he left his eldest son only five pounds while the estranged Jack and Betty were left one shilling each.&lt;ref name = "Elias"/&gt;

==Works==
Some of Pilkington's published works were anonymous or pseudonymous, but his authorship is either obvious or generally recognised. It is however possible that other works under so far unattributed pseudonyms were by him as well. The book which made his name, however, was ''The Gentleman's and Connoisseur's Dictionary of Painters'', which was regularly  expanded, revised, and retitled through many editions, being renamed ''A Dictionary of Painters'' in the 1805 and 1810 versions of [[Henry Fuseli]], and then ''A General Dictionary of Painters'' after 1824, commonly known as ''Pilkington's Dictionary''.&lt;ref name = "Elias"/&gt; His works were not free of controversy, some of which he sought, and an example is his contribution to [[Rapin de Thoyras]]' ''Impartial History'' (1784) which has been described as, "an extreme falsification of his life".&lt;ref name="Sorensen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/pilkingtonm.htm|title=Pilkington, Matthew|last=Sorensen|first=Lee|date=27 November 2000|work=Dictionary of Art Historians|accessdate=2009-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21261">'''Microbial biodegradation''' is the use of [[bioremediation]] and [[biotransformation]] methods to harness the naturally occurring ability of microbial [[xenobiotic metabolism]] to degrade, transform or accumulate environmental pollutants, including [[hydrocarbon]]s (e.g. oil), [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs), [[polyaromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), [[heterocyclic compounds]] (such as [[pyridine]] or [[quinoline]]), pharmaceutical substances, [[radionuclide]]s and metals.

Interest in the microbial biodegradation of [[pollutant]]s has intensified in recent years,&lt;ref name= KoukkouA-I&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Koukkou |editor1-first=Anna-Irini |year=2011 |title=Microbial Bioremediation of Non-metals: Current Research |publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] |isbn=978-1-904455-83-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Diaz&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Díaz |editor1-first=Eduardo |title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology |edition=1st |publisher=Caister Academic Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-904455-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recent major methodological breakthroughs have enabled detailed genomic, metagenomic, proteomic, bioinformatic and other high-throughput analyses of environmentally relevant [[microorganism]]s, providing new insights into biodegradative pathways and the ability of organisms to adapt to changing environmental conditions.

Biological processes play a major role in the removal of [[contaminant]]s and take advantage of the catabolic versatility of microorganisms to degrade or convert such compounds.  In environmental [[microbiology]], [[genome]]-based global studies are increasing the understanding of metabolic and regulatory networks, as well as providing new information on the evolution of degradation pathways and molecular adaptation strategies to changing environmental conditions.

==Aerobic biodegradation of pollutants==
The increasing amount of bacterial genomic data provides new opportunities for understanding the genetic and molecular bases of the degradation of organic [[pollutant]]s. [[Aromatic compounds]] are among the most persistent of these pollutants and lessons can be learned from the recent genomic studies of ''[[Burkholderia xenovorans]]'' LB400 and ''[[Rhodococcus]]'' sp. strain RHA1, two of the largest bacterial genomes completely sequenced to date. These studies have helped expand our understanding of bacterial [[catabolism]], non-catabolic physiological adaptation to [[organic compound]]s, and the evolution of large bacterial [[genome]]s. First, the [[metabolic pathway]]s from phylogenetically diverse isolates are very similar with respect to overall organization. Thus, as originally noted in [[pseudomonadaceae|pseudomonads]], a large number of "peripheral aromatic" pathways funnel a range of natural and [[xenobiotic]] compounds into a restricted number of "central aromatic" pathways. Nevertheless, these pathways are genetically organized in genus-specific fashions, as exemplified by the b-ketoadipate and Paa pathways. Comparative genomic studies further reveal that some pathways are more widespread than initially thought. Thus, the Box and Paa pathways illustrate the prevalence of non-oxygenolytic ring-cleavage strategies in aerobic aromatic degradation processes. Functional genomic studies have been useful in establishing that even organisms harboring high numbers of [[homologous enzymes]] seem to contain few examples of true redundancy. For example, the multiplicity of ring-cleaving dioxygenases in certain rhodococcal isolates may be attributed to the cryptic aromatic catabolism of different terpenoids and steroids. Finally, analyses have indicated that recent genetic flux appears to have played a more significant role in the evolution of some large genomes, such as LB400's, than others. However, the emerging trend is that the large gene repertoires of potent pollutant degraders such as LB400 and RHA1 have evolved principally through more ancient processes. That this is true in such phylogenetically diverse species is remarkable and further suggests the ancient origin of this catabolic capacity.&lt;ref name=chapter1&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=McLeod MP, Eltis LD|lastauthoramp=yes | year=2008|chapter=Genomic Insights Into the Aerobic Pathways for Degradation of Organic Pollutants|title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anaerobic biodegradation of pollutants==
[[Anaerobic organism|Anaerobic]] [[microbial]] mineralization of recalcitrant organic [[pollutant]]s is of great environmental significance and involves intriguing novel biochemical reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jugder|first=Bat-Erdene|last2=Ertan|first2=Haluk|last3=Lee|first3=Matthew|last4=Manefield|first4=Michael|last5=Marquis|first5=Christopher P.|date=2015|title=Reductive Dehalogenases Come of Age in Biological Destruction of Organohalides|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2015.07.004|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|volume=33|issue=10|pages=595–610|doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2015.07.004|issn=0167-7799|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[hydrocarbon]]s and halogenated compounds have long been doubted to be degradable in the absence of oxygen, but the isolation of hitherto unknown anaerobic hydrocarbon-degrading and reductively dehalogenating [[bacteria]] during the last decades provided ultimate proof for these processes in nature. While such research involved mostly [[chlorinated]] compounds initially, recent studies have revealed reductive dehalogenation of [[bromine]] and [[iodine]] moieties in aromatic pesticides.&lt;ref name="Cupples, A. M. 2005"&gt;Cupples, A. M., R. A. Sanford, and G. K. Sims.  2005. Dehalogenation of Bromoxynil (3,5-Dibromo-4-Hydroxybenzonitrile) and Ioxynil (3,5-Diiodino-4-Hydroxybenzonitrile) by [[Desulfitobacterium chlororespirans]].  Appl. Env. Micro. 71(7):3741-3746.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other reactions, such as biologically induced [[abiotic]] reduction by soil minerals,&lt;ref&gt;Tor, J., C. Xu, J. M. Stucki, M. Wander, G. K. Sims. 2000. Trifluralin degradation under micro-biologically induced nitrate and Fe(III) reducing conditions.  Env. Sci. Tech. 34:3148-3152.&lt;/ref&gt; has been shown to deactivate relatively persistent aniline-based herbicides far more rapidly than observed in aerobic environments.  Many novel biochemical reactions were discovered enabling the respective metabolic pathways, but progress in the molecular understanding of these bacteria was rather slow, since genetic systems are not readily applicable for most of them. However, with the increasing application of [[genomics]] in the field of [[environmental microbiology]], a new and promising perspective is now at hand to obtain molecular insights into these new metabolic properties. Several complete genome sequences were determined during the last few years from bacteria capable of anaerobic organic pollutant degradation. The ~4.7 Mb [[genome]] of the facultative denitrifying ''[[Aromatoleum aromaticum]]'' strain EbN1 was the first to be determined for an anaerobic hydrocarbon degrader (using [[toluene]] or [[ethylbenzene]] as [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]]s). The [[genome sequence]] revealed about two dozen [[gene cluster]]s (including several [[paralog]]s) coding for a complex catabolic network for anaerobic and aerobic degradation of aromatic compounds. The genome sequence forms the basis for current detailed studies on regulation of pathways and [[enzyme]] structures. Further genomes of anaerobic hydrocarbon degrading bacteria were recently completed for the iron-reducing species ''[[Geobacter metallireducens]]'' (accession nr. NC_007517) and the perchlorate-reducing ''[[Dechloromonas aromatica]]'' (accession nr. NC_007298), but these are not yet evaluated in formal publications. Complete genomes were also determined for bacteria capable of anaerobic degradation of halogenated hydrocarbons by [[halorespiration]]: the ~1.4 Mb genomes of ''[[Dehalococcoides ethenogenes]]'' strain 195 and ''[[Dehalococcoides]]'' sp. strain CBDB1 and the ~5.7 Mb genome of ''[[Desulfitobacterium hafniense]]'' strain Y51. Characteristic for all these bacteria is the presence of multiple paralogous genes for reductive dehalogenases, implicating a wider dehalogenating spectrum of the organisms than previously known. Moreover, genome sequences provided unprecedented insights into the evolution of reductive dehalogenation and differing strategies for niche adaptation.&lt;ref name=chapter2&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Heider J, Rabus R|lastauthoramp=yes |year=2008|chapter=Genomic Insights in the Anaerobic Biodegradation of Organic Pollutants|title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, it has become apparent that some organisms, including ''Desulfitobacterium chlororespirans'', originally evaluated for halorespiration on chlorophenols, can also use certain brominated compounds, such as the herbicide [[bromoxynil]] and its major metabolite as electron acceptors for growth.  Iodinated compounds may be dehalogenated as well, though the process may not satisfy the need for an electron acceptor.&lt;ref name="Cupples, A. M. 2005"/&gt;

==Bioavailability, chemotaxis, and transport of pollutants==
[[Bioavailability]], or the amount of a substance that is physiochemically accessible to [[microorganism]]s is a key factor in the efficient [[biodegradation]] of pollutants.  O'Loughlin ''et al.'' (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Loughlin | first1 = E. J | last2 = Traina | first2 = S. J. | last3 = Sims | first3 = G.

Toxicol. and Chem | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 2168–2174 | doi=10.1002/etc.5620190904}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that, with the exception of [[kaolinite]] clay, most soil clays and cation exchange resins attenuated biodegradation of [[2-picoline]] by ''[[Arthrobacter]]'' sp. strain R1, as a result of adsorption of the substrate to the clays.  [[Chemotaxis]], or the directed movement of motile organisms towards or away from chemicals in the environment is an important physiological response that may contribute to effective catabolism of molecules in the environment. In addition, mechanisms for the intracellular accumulation of aromatic molecules via various transport mechanisms are also important.&lt;ref name=chapter6&gt;{{cite book  |vauthors=Parales RE, etal |year=2008|chapter=Bioavailability, Chemotaxis, and Transport of Organic Pollutants|title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil biodegradation==
[[File:Biodegradation of Pollutants.png|thumb|General overview of microbial biodegradation of petroleum oil by microbial communities. Some microorganisms, such as ''A. borkumensis'', are able to use hydrocarbons as their source for carbon in metabolism. They are able to oxidize the environmentally harmful hydrocarbons while producing harmless products, following the general equation C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In the figure, carbon is represented as yellow circles, oxygen as pink circles, and hydrogen as blue circles. This type of special metabolism allows these microbes to thrive in areas affected by oil spills and are important in the elimination of environmental pollutants.]]
[[Petroleum]] oil  contains aromatic compounds that are toxic to most life forms. Episodic and chronic [[pollution]] of the environment by oil causes major disruption to the local ecological environment. Marine environments in particular are especially vulnerable, as oil spills near coastal regions and in the open sea are difficult to contain and make mitigation efforts more complicated. In addition to pollution through human activities, approximately 250 million litres of petroleum enter the marine environment every year from natural seepages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Cholesterol biodegradation==
Many synthetic steroidic compounds like some sexual hormones frequently appear in municipal and industrial wastewaters, acting as environmental pollutants with strong metabolic activities negatively affecting the ecosystems. Since these compounds are common carbon sources for many different microorganisms their aerobic and anaerobic mineralization has been extensively studied. The interest of these studies lies on the biotechnological applications of sterol transforming enzymes for the industrial synthesis of sexual hormones and corticoids. Very recently, the catabolism of cholesterol has acquired a high relevance because it is involved in the infectivity of the pathogen ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' (''Mtb'').&lt;ref name="KoukkouA-I"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wipperman|first1=Matthew, F.|last2=Sampson|first2=Nicole, S.|last3=Thomas|first3=Suzanne, T.|title=Pathogen roid rage: Cholesterol utilization by Mycobacterium tuberculosis|journal=Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol|date=2014|doi=10.3109/10409238.2014.895700|pmid=24611808|volume=49|issue=4|pages=269–93|pmc=4255906}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mtb'' causes [[tuberculosis]] disease, and it has been demonstrated that novel enzyme architectures have evolved to bind and modify steroid compounds like cholesterol in this organism and other steroid-utilizing bacteria as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=S.T.|last2=Sampson|first2=N.S.|title=Mycobacterium tuberculosis utilizes a unique heterotetrameric structure for dehydrogenation of the cholesterol side chain|journal=Biochemistry|date=2013|volume=52|issue=17|pages=2895–2904|doi=10.1021/bi4002979|pmid=23560677|pmc=3726044}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wipperman|first1=M.F.|last2=Yang|first2=M.|last3=Thomas|first3=S.T.|last4=Sampson|first4=N.S.|title=Shrinking the FadE Proteome of ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'': Insights into Cholesterol Metabolism through Identification of an α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Heterotetrameric Acyl Coenzyme A Dehydrogenase Family|journal=J.

==Analysis of waste biotreatment==
Sustainable development requires the promotion of environmental management and a constant search for new technologies to treat vast quantities of wastes generated by increasing [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] activities. Biotreatment, the processing of wastes using living organisms, is an environmentally friendly, relatively simple and cost-effective alternative to physico-chemical clean-up options. Confined environments, such as [[bioreactors]], have been engineered to overcome the physical, chemical and biological limiting factors of biotreatment processes in highly controlled systems. The great versatility in the design of confined environments allows the treatment of a wide range of wastes under optimized conditions. To perform a correct assessment, it is necessary to consider various microorganisms having a variety of [[genome]]s and expressed transcripts and proteins. A great number of analyses are often required. Using traditional genomic techniques, such assessments are limited and time-consuming. However, several high-throughput techniques originally developed for medical studies can be applied to assess biotreatment in confined environments.&lt;ref name=chapter10&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Watanabe K, Kasai Y|lastauthoramp=yes |year=2008|chapter=Emerging Technologies to Analyze Natural Attenuation and Bioremediation|title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metabolic engineering and biocatalytic applications==
The study of the fate of persistent organic chemicals in the environment has revealed a large reservoir of enzymatic reactions with a large potential in preparative organic synthesis, which has already been exploited for a number of [[oxygenase]]s on pilot and even on industrial scale. Novel catalysts can be obtained from [[metagenomic]] libraries and [[DNA sequence]] based approaches. Our increasing capabilities in adapting the catalysts to specific reactions and process requirements by rational and random [[mutagenesis]] broadens the scope for application in the fine chemical industry, but also in the field of [[biodegradation]]. In many cases, these catalysts need to be exploited in whole cell [[bioconversion]]s or in [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]]s, calling for system-wide approaches to understanding strain physiology and metabolism and rational approaches to the engineering of whole cells as they are increasingly put forward in the area of systems [[biotechnology]] and synthetic biology.&lt;ref name=chapter12&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Meyer A, Panke S|lastauthoramp=yes |year=2008|chapter=Genomics in Metabolic Engineering and Biocatalytic Applications of the Pollutant Degradation Machinery|title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fungal biodegradation==
In the ecosystem, different substrates are attacked at different rates by consortia of organisms from different kingdoms. ''[[Aspergillus]]'' and other [[mould]]s play an important role in these consortia because they are adept at recycling starches, hemicelluloses, celluloses, pectins and other sugar polymers. Some aspergilli are capable of degrading more refractory compounds such as fats, oils, chitin, and keratin. Maximum decomposition occurs when there is sufficient nitrogen, phosphorus and other essential inorganic nutrients. Fungi also provide food for many soil organisms.&lt;ref name="MachidaMGomiK"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Machida |editor1-first=Masayuki |editor2-last=Gomi |editor2-first=Katsuya |year=2010 |title=''Aspergillus'': Molecular Biology and Genomics |publisher=Caister Academic Press |isbn=978-1-904455-53-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''Aspergillus'' the process of degradation is the means of obtaining nutrients. When these moulds degrade human-made substrates, the process usually is called biodeterioration. Both paper and textiles (cotton, jute, and linen) are particularly vulnerable to ''Aspergillus'' degradation. Our artistic heritage is also subject to ''Aspergillus'' assault. To give but one example, after Florence in Italy flooded in 1969, 74% of the isolates from a damaged Ghirlandaio fresco in the Ognissanti church were ''Aspergillus versicolor''.&lt;ref name="Bennettjw"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bennett JW |year=2010 |chapter=An Overview of the Genus ''Aspergillus'' |chapter-url=http://www.open-access-biology.com/aspergillus/aspergillusch1.pdf |title=''Aspergillus'': Molecular Biology and Genomics |publisher=Caister Academic Press |isbn=978-1-904455-53-0 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617021430/http://www.open-access-biology.com/aspergillus/aspergillusch1.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mining engineering''' is an [[engineering]] discipline that applies science and technology to the extraction of [[mineral]]s from the earth. Mining engineering is associated with many other disciplines, such as [[geology]], [[mineral processing]] and [[metallurgy]], [[geotechnical engineering]] and [[surveying]]. A mining engineer may manage any phase of mining operations – from exploration and discovery of the mineral resource, through [[feasibility study]], mine design, development of plans, [[production (economics)|production]] and operations to [[mine closure]].

With the process of [[Mineral extraction]], some amount of [[waste]] and uneconomic material are generated which are the primary source of [[pollution]] in the vicinity of mines. Mining activities by their nature cause a disturbance of the [[natural environment]] in and around which the [[minerals]] are located. [[Mining]] engineers must therefore be concerned not only with the production and processing of mineral [[commodities]], but also with the mitigation of damage to the environment both during and after mining as a result of the change in the mining area.

==History of mining engineering==
From [[prehistoric]] times to the present, [[mining]] has played a significant role in the existence of the [[human race]]. Since the beginning of civilization people have used [[Rock (geology)|stone]] and [[ceramic]]s and, later, [[metal]]s found on or close to the [[Earth|Earth's]] surface. These were used to manufacture early [[tool]]s and [[weapon]]s. For example, high quality [[flint]] found in northern [[France]] and southern [[England]] were used to set [[fire]] and break rock.&lt;ref&gt;Hartman, Howard L. ''SME Mining Engineering Handbook'', Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration Inc, 1992, p3.&lt;/ref&gt; Flint mines have been found in [[chalk]] areas where seams of the stone were followed underground by shafts and galleries. The oldest known mine on archaeological record is the "Lion Cave" in [[Swaziland]]. At this site, which [[radiocarbon dating]] indicates to be about 43,000 years old, [[paleolithic]] humans mined mineral [[hematite]], which contained [[iron]] and was ground to produce the red [[pigment]] [[ochre]].&lt;ref&gt;Swaziland Natural Trust Commission, "Cultural Resources – Malolotja Archaeology, Lion Cavern," Retrieved Aug. 27, 2007, {{cite web|url=http://www.sntc.org.sz/cultural/malarch.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221001/http://www.sntc.org.sz/cultural/malarch.asp |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peace Parks Foundation, "Major Features: Cultural Importance." Republic of South Africa: Author. Retrieved Aug. 27, 2007, [http://www.peaceparks.org/story.php?mid=168&amp;pid=148].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] were innovators of [[mining]] engineering. They developed large scale mining methods, such as the use of large volumes of water brought to the minehead by numerous [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] for [[hydraulic mining]]. The exposed rock was then attacked by [[fire-setting]] where fires were used to heat the rock, which would be quenched with a stream of water. The [[thermal shock]] cracked the rock, enabling it to be removed. In some mines the Romans utilized water-powered machinery such as [[reverse overshot water-wheel]]s. These were used extensively in the [[copper]] mines at [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] in Spain, where one sequence comprised 16 such wheels arranged in pairs, lifting water about {{convert|80|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romans-in-britain.org.uk/raw_mining.htm ''The Romans in Britain: mining''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720073131/http://www.romans-in-britain.org.uk/raw_mining.htm |date=2010-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[gun powder|Black powder]] was first used in mining in [[Banská Štiavnica]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (present-day [[Slovakia]]) in 1627.&lt;ref&gt;Heiss, A.G. &amp; Oeggl, K. (2008). Analysis of the fuel wood used in Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age copper mining sites of the Schwaz and Brixlegg area (Tyrol, Austria). ''Vegetation History and Archaeobotany'' 17(2):211–221, Springer Berlin / Heidelberg, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-007-0096-8].&lt;/ref&gt;  This allowed blasting of rock and earth to loosen and reveal ore veins, which was much faster than fire-setting. The [[Industrial Revolution]] saw further advances in mining technologies, including improved explosives and [[Steam engine|steam-powered]] pumps, lifts, and drills as long as they remained safe.

==Education==
[[File:Coloradosm.png|1,200 × 800 px|thumb|Students outside [[Colorado School of Mines]] campus]]

Some Mining Engineers go on to pursue [[Doctorate]] degree programs such as [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D., DPhil), [[Doctor of Engineering]] (D.Eng., Eng.D.) these programs involve a very significant original research component and are usually seen as entry points into [[Academia]].

==Salary and statistics==
Mining salaries are usually determined by the level of skill required, where the position is, and what kind of organization the engineer is working for.{{cn|date=May 2017}} When comparing salaries from one region to another, cost of living and other factors need to be taken into consideration.

Mining engineers in [[India]] earn relatively high salaries in comparison to many other professions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://careerminer.infomine.com/geologist-and-mining-engineer-salaries-in-india/ |title=Geologist and Mining Engineer salaries in India}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an average salary of $15,250. However, in comparison to mining engineer salaries in other regions, such as Canada, the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom, Indian salaries are low.  In the [[United States]], there are an estimated 6,150 employed mining engineers, with a mean yearly salary of U.S. $103,710.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes172151.htm |title=Occupational Employment and Wages, May 2017 – 17-2151 Mining and Geological Engineers, Including Mining Safety Engineers |date=May 20, 2018 |work=Occupational Employment Statistics |publisher=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] |accessdate=May 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-mining==
[[File:The Prospector NC Wyeth.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Prospector'' by [[N. C. Wyeth]], 1906]]
Mineral exploration is the process of finding [[ore]]s (commercially viable concentrations of minerals) to [[mining|mine]]. Mineral exploration is a much more intensive, organized and professional form of mineral [[prospecting]] and, though it frequently uses the services of prospecting, the process of mineral exploration on the whole is much more involved.

The foremost stage of mining starts with the process of finding and exploration of the mineral deposit. In the initial process of mineral exploration, however, the role of [[geologists]] and [[surveying|surveyors]] is prominent in the [[pre-feasibility study]] of the future mining operation. Mineral exploration and estimation of reserve through various prospecting methods are done to determine the method and type of mining in addition to profitability condition.

===Mineral discovery===
Once a mineral discovery has been made, and has been determined to be of sufficient economic quality to mine, mining engineers will then work on developing a plan to mine this effectively and efficiently.

The discovery can be made from research of mineral maps, academic geological reports or local, state, and national geological reports. Other sources of information include property assays, well drilling logs, and local word of mouth. Mineral research may also include satellite and airborne photographs. Unless the mineral exploration is done on public property, the owners of the property may play a significant role in the exploration process, and may be the original discoverer of the mineral deposit.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Wiliam C, SME: Mining Engineering Handbook, 2nd edition, Volume 1, C1992, "Geologic Prospecting and Exploration," pgs. 221–225, {{ISBN|0-87335-100-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mineral determination===
After a prospective mineral is located, the mining geologist and/or mining engineer then determines the ore properties. This may involve chemical analysis of the ore to determine the composition of the sample. Once the mineral properties are identified, the next step is determining the quantity of the ore. This involves determining the extent of the deposit as well as the purity of the ore.&lt;ref&gt;Gumble, Gordon E, Et al. SME: Mining Engineering Handbook, 2nd edition, Volume 1, C1992, "Sample Preparation and Assaying", pgs 327–332, {{ISBN|0-87335-100-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geologist drills additional core samples to find the limits of the deposit or seam and calculates the quantity of valuable material present in the deposit.

===Feasibility study===
{{Main|Mining feasibility study}}
Once the mineral identification and reserve amount is reasonably determined, the next step is to determine the [[feasibility study|feasibility]] of recovering the mineral deposit. A preliminary study shortly after the discovery of the deposit examines the market conditions such as the supply and demand of the mineral, the amount of ore needed to be moved to recover a certain quantity of that mineral as well as analysis of the cost associated with the operation. This pre-feasibility study determines whether the mining project is likely to be profitable; if it is then a more in-depth analysis of the deposit is undertaken. After the full extent of the ore body is known and has been examined by engineers, the feasibility study examines the cost of initial capital investment, methods of extraction, the cost of operation, an estimated length of time to payback, the gross revenue and net [[profit margin]], any possible resale price of the land, the total life of the reserve, the total value of the reserve, investment in future projects, and the property owner or owners' contract. In addition, environmental impact, reclamation, possible legal ramifications and all government permitting are considered.&lt;ref&gt;Gentry Donald W., SME: Mining Engineering Handbook, 2nd edition, Volume 1, C1992, "Mine Evaluation and Investment Analysis", pgs 387–389, {{ISBN|0-87335-100-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Hara, T. Alan and Stanley C. Suboleski, SME: Mining Engineering Handbook, 2nd edition, Volume 1, C1992, "Costs and Cost Estimation", pgs 405–408, {{ISBN|0-87335-100-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These steps of analysis determine whether the mine company should proceed with the extraction of the minerals or whether the project should be abandoned. The mining company may decide to sell the rights to the reserve to a third party rather than develop it themselves, or the decision to proceed with extraction may be postponed indefinitely until market conditions become favorable.

==Mining operation==
Mining engineers working in an established mine may work as an engineer for operations improvement, further [[mineral exploration]], and operation capitalization by determining where in the mine to add equipment and personnel. The engineer may also work in supervision and management, or as an equipment and mineral salesperson. In addition to engineering and operations, the &lt;nowiki&gt;mining engineer&lt;/nowiki&gt; may work as an environmental, health and safety manager or design engineer.

The act of mining required different methods of extraction depending on the [[mineralogy]], [[geology]], and location of the resources. Characteristics such as [[mineral hardness]], the mineral [[stratum|stratification]], and access to that mineral will determine the method of extraction.

Generally, mining is either done from the surface or underground. Mining can also occur with both surface and underground operations taking place on the same reserve. Mining activity varies as to what method is employed to remove the mineral.

===Surface mining===
[[Surface mining]] comprises 90% of the world's mineral tonnage output. Also called [[Open-pit mining|open pit mining]], surface mining is removing minerals in formations that are at or near the surface. Ore retrieval is done by material removal from the land in its natural state. Surface mining often alters the land characteristics, shape, [[topography]], and geological make-up.

Surface mining involves quarrying which is excavating minerals by means of machinery such as cutting, cleaving, and breaking. [[Explosives]] are usually used to facilitate breakage. Hard rocks such as limestone, sand, gravel, and slate are generally quarried into a series of benches.

Strip mining is done on softer minerals such as clays and phosphate are removed through use of mechanical shovels, track dozers, and front end loaders. Softer Coal seams can also be extracted this way.

With [[placer mining]], minerals can also be removed from the bottoms of lakes, rivers, streams, and even the ocean by dredge mining. In addition, [[in-situ]] mining can be done from the surface using dissolving agents on the ore body and retrieving the ore via pumping. The pumped material is then set to leach for further processing. Hydraulic mining is utilized in forms of water jets to wash away either overburden or the ore itself.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Bohnet, SME: Mining Engineering Handbook, 2nd edition, Volume 2, C1992, "Surface Mining: Comparison of Methods", pgs 1529–1538, {{ISBN|0-87335-100-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mining process===
Blasting:&lt;br&gt;
[[Explosive]]s are used to break up a rock formation and aid in the collection of [[ore]] in a process called [[Rock blasting|blasting]].  Blasting utilizes the heat and immense pressure of the detonated explosives to shatter and fracture a rock mass. The type of explosives used in mining are [[Explosive material#High explosives|high explosives]] which vary in composition and performance properties.  The mining engineer is responsible for the selection and proper placement of these explosives, in order to maximize efficiency and safety.  Blasting occurs in many phases of the mining process, such as development of infrastructure as well as production of the ore.

Leaching:&lt;br&gt;
[[Leaching (metallurgy)|Leaching]] is the loss or extraction of certain materials from a carrier into a liquid (usually, but not always a solvent). Mostly used in rare-earth metals extraction.

Flotation:&lt;br&gt;
[[Froth flotation#Mining|Flotation]] (also spelled floatation) involves phenomena related to the relative buoyancy of minerals.It is the most widely used metal separate method.

Electrostatic separation:&lt;br&gt;
[[Electrostatic separator|Separating]] minerals by electro-characteristic differences.

Gravity separation:&lt;br&gt;
[[Gravity separation]] is an industrial method of separating two components, either a suspension, or dry granular mixture where separating the components with gravity is sufficiently practical.

Magnetic separation:&lt;br&gt;
[[Magnetic separation]] is a process in which magnetically susceptible material is extracted from a mixture using a magnetic force. 

Hydraulic separation:&lt;br&gt;
[[Hydraulic separation]] is a process that using the density difference to separate minerals. Before hydraulic separation, minerals were crushed into uniform size; because minerals have uniform size and different density will have different settling velocities in water, and that can be used to separate target minerals.

==Mining health and safety==
{{globalize/USA|date=December 2010}}
{{Main|Mine Safety and Health Administration}}
Legal attention to Mining Health and Safety began in the late 19th century and in the subsequent 20th century progressed to a comprehensive and stringent codification of enforcement and mandatory health and safety regulation. A mining engineer in whatever role they occupy must follow all federal, state, and local mine safety laws.

===United States===
{{Main|Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977}}
The United States Congress, through the passage of the Federal [[Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977]], known as the Miner's Act, created the [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA) under the [[US Department of Labor]].

This comprehensive Act provides miners with rights against retaliation for reporting violations, consolidated regulation of coal mines with metallic and nonmetallic mines, and created the independent [[Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission]] to review MSHA's reported violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msha.gov/MSHAINFO/MSHAINF2.HTM|title=History of Mine Safety and Health Legislation|author=|date=|website=www.msha.gov|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act as codified in Code of Federal Regulations § 30 (CFR § 30) covers all miners at an active mine. When a mining engineer works at an active mine he or she is subject to the same rights, violations, mandatory health and safety regulations, and mandatory training as any other worker at the mine. The mining engineer can be legally identified as a "miner."&lt;ref&gt;20 CFR § 46.2(g)(1)(i)(ii)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act establishes the rights of miners. The miner may report at any time a hazardous condition and request an inspection. The miners may elect a miners' representative to participate during an inspection, pre-inspection meeting, and post-inspection conference. The miners and miners' representative shall be paid for their time during all inspections and investigations.&lt;ref&gt;The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, § 103(f) and (g)(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mining and the environment==
===United States===
{{globalize/USA|date=December 2010}}

Land reclamation is regulated for surface and underground mines according to the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. The law creates as a part of the Department of Interior, the Bureau of Surface Mining (OSM). OSM states on their website, “OSM is charged with balancing the nation’s need for continued domestic coal production with protection of the environment.”

The law requires that states set up their own Reclamation Departments and legislate laws related to reclamation for coal mining operations. The states may impose additional regulations and regulate other minerals in addition to coal for land reclamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osmre.gov/AboutUs.htm|title=Your Page Was Not Found on the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement Website|author=|date=|website=www.osmre.gov|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nutrient management''' is the science and practice directed to link [[soil]], [[crop]], [[weather]], and [[hydrologic]] factors with cultural, [[irrigation]], and [[soil conservation|soil]] and [[water conservation]] practices to achieve optimal nutrient use efficiency, [[crop yield]]s, crop quality, and [[economic returns]], while reducing off-site transport of [[soil nutrient|nutrients]] ([[fertilizer]]) that may [[environmental impact of agriculture|impact the environment]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=627Qopsj7bsC&amp;pg=PA1157 Delgado and Lemunyon. “Nutrient Management.” In Encyclopedia of Soil Science (Vol 2). Ed. Rattan Lal. CRC Press, 2006. pp 1157 – 1160.]&lt;/ref&gt; It involves matching a specific field soil, climate, and crop management conditions to rate, source, timing, and place (commonly known as the '''4R nutrient stewardship''') of nutrient application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nutrientstewardship.com/ 4R Nutrient Stewardship]&lt;/ref&gt;

Important factors that need to be considered when managing nutrients include (a) the application of nutrients considering the achievable optimum yields and, in some cases, crop quality; (b) the management, application, and timing of nutrients using a budget based on all sources and sinks active at the site; and (c) the management of soil, water, and crop to minimize the off-site transport of nutrients from nutrient leaching out of the root zone, [[surface runoff]], and volatilization (or other gas exchanges).

There can be potential interactions because of differences in nutrient pathways and dynamics. For instance, practices that reduce the off-site surface transport of a given nutrient may increase the leaching losses of other nutrients. These complex dynamics present nutrient managers the difficult task of achieve the best balance for [[profit maximization|maximizing profit]] while contributing to the conservation of our [[biosphere]].

==Nutrient management plan==
[[Image:Epandeur de Fumier Rolland.JPG|right|thumb|[[Manure spreader]]]]
A crop '''nutrient management plan''' is a tool that [[farmer]]s can use to increase the efficiency of all the nutrient sources a crop uses while reducing production and [[environmental risk]], ultimately increasing [[profit (economics)|profit]]. It is generally agreed that there are ten fundamental components of a Crop Nutrient Management Plan. Each component is critical to helping analyze each field and improve nutrient efficiency for the crops grown. These components include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://extension.psu.edu/plants/nutrient-management/educational/nutrient-management-general/nutrient-management-planning-an-overview Nutrient Management Planning: An Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Field map]]: The map, including general reference points (such as streams, residences, wellheads etc.), number of acres, and soil types is the base for the rest of the plan.
;[[Soil test]]:  How much of each nutrient (N-P-K and other critical elements such as pH and organic matter) is in the soil profile? The soil test is a key component needed for developing the nutrient rate recommendation.
;[[Crop sequence]]:  Did the crop that grew in the field last year (and in many cases two or more years ago) fix nitrogen for use in the following years? Has long-term no-till increased organic matter? Did the end-of-season stalk test show a [[Plant nutrition#Nutrient deficiency|nutrient deficiency]]? These factors also need to be factored into the plan.
;Estimated yield:  Factors that affect yield are numerous and complex. A field’s soils, [[drainage]], insect, [[weed]] and [[plant disease|crop disease]] pressure, rotation and many other factors differentiate one field from another. This is why using historic yields is important in developing yield estimates for next year. Accurate yield estimates can improve nutrient use efficiency.
;Sources and forms:  The sources and forms of available nutrients can vary from farm-to-farm and even field-to-field. For instance, [[manure]] fertility analysis, storage practices and other factors will need to be included in a nutrient management plan. Manure nutrient tests/analysis are one way to determine the fertility of it. [[Nitrogen fixation|Nitrogen fixed]] from a previous year’s [[legume]] crop and residual affects of manure also effects rate recommendations. Many other nutrient sources should also be factored into this plan. 
;Sensitive areas:  What’s out of the ordinary about a field’s plan? Is it irrigated? Next to a stream or lake? Especially sandy in one area? Steep slope or low area? Manure applied in one area for generations due to proximity of dairy barn? Extremely productive—or unproductive—in a portion of the field? Are there buffers that protect streams, drainage ditches, wellheads, and other [[water collection]] points? How far away are the neighbors? What’s the general wind direction? This is the place to note these and other special conditions that need to be considered.
;Recommended rates: Here’s the place where science, technology, and art meet. Given everything you’ve noted, what is the optimum rate of N, P, K, lime and any other nutrients? While science tells us that a crop has changing nutrient requirements during the growing season, a combination of technology and farmer’s management skills assure optimum nutrient availability at all stages of growth. No-till corn generally requires starter [[fertilizer]] to give the seedling a healthy start.
;Recommended timing: When does the soil temperature drop below 50 degrees? Will a N stabilizer be used? What’s the tillage practice? Strip-till corn and no-till often require different timing approaches than seed planted into a field that’s been tilled once with a field cultivator. Will a starter fertilizer be used to give the seedling a healthy start? How many acres can be covered with available labor (custom or hired) and equipment? Does manure application in a farm depend on a custom applicator’s schedule? What agreements have been worked out with neighbors for manure use on their fields? Is a neighbor hosting a special event? All these factors and more will likely figure into the recommended timing.
;Recommended methods: Surface or injected? While injection is clearly preferred, there may be situations where injection is not feasible (i.e. pasture, grassland). Slope, rainfall patterns, soil type, crop rotation and many other factors determine which method is best for optimizing nutrient efficiency (availability and loss) in farms. The combination that’s right in one field may differ in another field even with the same crop.
;Annual review and update: Even the best managers are forced to deviate from their plans. What rate was actually applied? Where? Using which method? Did an unusually mild winter or wet spring reduce soil nitrate? Did a dry summer, disease, or some other unusual factor increase nutrient carryover? These and other factors should be noted. It’s easier to make notes throughout the year than to remember back six to 10 months.

When such a plan is designed for [[animal feeding operations]] (AFO), it may be termed a "manure management plan." In the United States, some regulatory agencies recommend or require that farms implement these plans in order to prevent [[water pollution]]. The U.S. [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] (NRCS) has published guidance documents on preparing a comprehensive nutrient management plan (CNMP) for AFOs.&lt;ref&gt;NRCS. Beltsville, MD. [https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/afo/pdf/CNMPFactSheet.pdf "Comprehensive Nutrient Management Plans."] Fact Sheet. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NRCS. [https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/afo/cnmp_guide_index.html "National Planning Procedures Handbook: Draft Comprehensive Nutrient Management Planning Technical Guidance."] Subpart E, Parts 600.50-600.54 and Subpart F, Part 600.75. December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Plant Nutrition Institute has published a 4R [[plant nutrition]] manual for improving the management of plant nutrition. The manual outlines the scientific principles behind each of the four R’s or “rights” (right source of nutrient, right application rate, right time, right place) and discusses the adoption of 4R practices on the farm, approaches to nutrient management planning, and measurement of sustainability performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipni.net/article/IPNI-3255 4R Plant Nutrition Manual]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nitrogen management==
Of the 16 essential plant nutrients, nitrogen is usually the most difficult to manage in field crop systems. This is because the quantity of plant-available nitrogen can change rapidly in response to changes in soil water status. Nitrogen can be lost from the plant-soil system by one or more of the following processes: [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]]; [[surface runoff]]; [[soil erosion]]; [[Ammonia volatilization from urea|ammonia volatilization]]; and [[denitrification]].&lt;ref name=Davis2007&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=John|title=Nitrogen Efficiency and Management|url=https://directives.sc.egov.usda.gov/OpenNonWebContent.aspx?content=18563.wba|publisher=USDA NRCS|accessdate=19 December 2017|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nitrogen Management Practices that Improve Nitrogen Efficiency===

Nitrogen management aims to maximize the efficiency with which crops use applied N. Improvements in N use efficiency are associated with decreases in N loss from the soil. Although losses cannot be avoided completely, significant improvements can be realized by applying one or more of the following management practices in the cropping system.&lt;ref name=Davis2007/&gt;

====Reduction of N loss in runoff water and eroded soil====
* [[No-till]], [[conservation tillage]] and other [[surface runoff|runoff]] control measures reduce N loss in surface runoff and [[Soil erosion|eroded soil material]].
* The use of daily estimates of [[Water content|soil moisture]] and crop needs to [[Irrigation scheduling|schedule irrigation]] reduces the risk of [[surface runoff]] and [[soil erosion]].

====Reduction of the [[volatilization]] of N as ammonia gas====
* Incorporation and/or injection of urea and ammonium-containing fertilizers decreases ammonia volatilization because good soil contact buffers pH and slows the generation of [[ammonia]] gas from [[ammonium]] ions.
* [[Urease]] inhibitors temporarily block the function of the urease enzyme, maintaining urea-based fertilizers in the non-volatile urea form, reducing [[Ammonia volatilization from urea|volatilization]] losses when these fertilizers are surface applied; these losses can be meaningful in high-residue, conservation tillage systems.

====Prevention of the build-up of high soil nitrate concentrations====
Nitrate is the form of nitrogen that is most susceptible to loss from the soil, through [[denitrification]] and [[leaching (agriculture)|leaching]]. The amount of N lost via these processes can be limited by restricting soil nitrate concentrations, especially at times of high risk. This can be done in many ways, although these are not always cost-effective.

=====''Nitrogen Rates''=====
Rates of N application should be high enough to maximize profits in the long term and minimize residual (unused) nitrate in the soil after harvest.
* The use of local research to determine recommended nitrogen application rates should result in appropriate N rates.
* Recommended N application rates often rely on an assessment of yield expectations - these should be realistic, and preferably based on accurate yield records.
* Fertilizer N rates should be corrected for N that is likely to be [[Mineralization (soil science)|mineralized]] from [[soil organic matter]] and crop residues (especially legume residues).
* Fertilizer N rates should allow for N applied in manure, in irrigation water, and from atmospheric deposition.
* Where feasible, appropriate [[soil test]]s can be used to determine residual soil N.

=====''Soil Testing for N''=====
* Preplant soil tests provide information on the soil’s N-supply power.
* Late spring or pre-side-dress N tests can determine if and how much additional N is needed.
* New soil test and sampling procedures, such as amino sugar tests, grid mapping, and real-time sensors can refine N requirements.
* Post-harvest soil tests determine if N management the previous season was appropriate.

=====''Crop Testing for N''=====
* Plant tissue tests can identify N deficiencies.
* Sensing variations in plant chlorophyll content facilitates variable rate N applications in-season.
* Post-black-layer corn stalk nitrate tests help to determine if N rates were low, optimal, or excessive in the previous crop, so that management changes can be made in following crops.

=====''[[Precision agriculture]]''=====
* Variable rate applicators, combined with intensive soil or crop sampling, allow more precise and responsive application rates.&lt;ref name="Basso2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Basso|first1=Bruno|last2=Dumont|first2=Benjamin|last3=Cammarano|first3=Davide|last4=Pezzuolo|first4=Andrea|last5=Marinello|first5=Francesco|last6=Sartori|first6=Luigi|title=Environmental and economic benefits of variable rate nitrogen fertilization in a nitrate vulnerable zone|journal=Science of the Total Environment|date=March 2016|volume=545-546|pages=227–235|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.12.104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Timing of N Applications''=====
* Apply N close to the time when crops can utilize it.
* Make side-dress N applications close to the time of most rapid N uptake.
* Split applications, involving more than one application, allow efficient use of applied N and reduce the risk of N loss to the environment.

=====''N Forms, including Slow or Controlled Release Fertilizers and Inhibitors''=====
* Slow or controlled release fertilizer delays the availability of nitrogen to the plant until a time that is more appropriate for plant uptake - the risk of N loss through denitrification and leaching is reduced by limiting nitrate concentrations in the soil.
* Nitrification inhibitors maintain applied N in the ammonium form for a longer period of time, thereby reducing leaching and denitrification losses.

=====''N capture''=====
* Particular crop varieties are able to more efficiently extract N from the soil and improve N use efficiency. Breeding of crops for efficient N uptake is in progress.
* Rotation with deep-rooted crops helps capture nitrates deeper in the soil profile.
* Cover crops capture residual nitrogen after crop harvest and recycle it as plant biomass.
* Elimination of restrictions to [[subsoil]] root development; subsoil [[soil compaction|compaction]] and subsoil acidity prevent root penetration in many subsoils worldwide, promoting build-up of subsoil nitrate concentrations which are susceptible to denitrification and leaching when conditions are suitable.
* Good agronomic practice, including appropriate plant populations and spacing and good weed and pest management, allows crops to produce large root systems to optimse N capture and crop yield.

====Water management====
=====''Conservation tillage''=====
* Conservation tillage optimizes soil moisture conditions that improve water use efficiency; in water-stressed conditions, this improves crop yield per unit N applied.

=====''N Fertilizer Application Method and Placement''=====
* In ridged crops, placing N fertilizers in a band in ridges makes N less susceptible to leaching.
* Row fertilizer applicators, such as injectors, which form a compacted soil layer and surface ridge, can reduce N losses by diverting water flow.

=====''Good [[irrigation]] management can dramatically improve N-use efficiency''=====
* Scheduled irrigation based on soil moisture estimates and daily crop needs will improve both water-use and N-use efficiency.
* Sprinkler irrigation systems apply water more uniformly and in lower amounts than furrow or basin irrigation systems.
* Furrow irrigation efficiency can be improved by adjusting set time, stream size, furrow length, watering every other row, or the use of surge valves.
* Alternate row irrigation and fertilization minimizes water contact with nutrients.
* Application of N fertilizer through irrigation systems ([[fertigation]]) facilitates N supply when crop demand is greatest.
* [[Polyacrylamide]] (PAM) treatment during furrow irrigation reduces sediment and N losses.

=====''Drainage Systems''=====
* Some [[subirrigation]] systems recycle nitrate leached from the soil profile and reduce nitrate lost in drainage water.
* Excessive drainage can lead to rapid through-flow of water and N [[leaching (agriculture)|leaching]], but restricted or insufficient drainage favors [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] conditions and [[denitrification]].

====Use of simulation models====
Short-term changes in the plant-available N status make accurate seasonal predictions of crop N requirement difficult in most situations. However, models (such as NLEAP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrient Management -- Nitrogen {{!}} NRCS|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detailfull/national/technical/ecoscience/mnm/?cid=stelprdb1044740|website=www.nrcs.usda.gov|accessdate=19 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adapt-N]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sela|first1=Shai|last2=van Es|first2=Harold M.|last3=Moebius-Clune|first3=Bianca N.|last4=Marjerison|first4=Rebecca|last5=Moebius-Clune|first5=Daniel|last6=Schindelbeck|first6=Robert|last7=Severson|first7=Keith|last8=Young|first8=Eric|title=Dynamic Model Improves Agronomic and Environmental Outcomes for Maize Nitrogen Management over Static Approach|journal=Journal of Environment Quality|date=2017|volume=46|issue=2|page=311|doi=10.2134/jeq2016.05.0182}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that use soil, weather, crop, and field management data can be updated with day-to-day changes and thereby improve predictions of the fate of applied N. They allows farmers to make adaptive management decisions that can improve N-use efficiency and minimize N losses and environmental impact while maximizing profitability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saol|first1=T.

===Additional measures to minimize environmental impact===

====Conservation Buffers====
* Buffers trap sediment containing ammonia and organic N.
* Nitrate in subsurface flow is reduced through denitrification enhanced by carbon energy sources contained in the soil associated with buffer vegetation.
* Buffer vegetation takes up nitrogen, other nutrients, and reduces loss to water.

====Constructed Wetlands====
* Constructed wetlands located strategically on the landscape to process drainage effluent reduces sediment and nitrate loads to surface water.

An unpublished manuscript entitled "Ordenanzas del Baratillo de México"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Ordenanzas del baratillo de México dadas por vía de exortación o consejo a sus doctores compuestas por don Pedro Anselmo Chreslos Jache
|publisher=Biblioteca Nacional de España}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Decrees of the Baratillo of Mexico) was signed and dated in 1754 by Pedro Anselmo Chreslos Jache, likely a pseudonym for an educated Spaniard.  It is a satirical piece of eighteenth-century colonial literature written in [[New Spain]] (modern day Mexico), which sought to offer an alternative view of life in colonial [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Julie Greer|title=Satire in Colonial America: Turning the New World Upside Down|year=1993|publisher=University of Texas|location=Austin|isbn=978-0-292-72980-3|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

The Baratillo was an infamous market in [[Mexico City]] known for the sale of used items, many of which had been stolen and were cheaply priced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ortega|first=Sandra|title=La Plaza Mayor, tres siglos de dominación española|url=http://www.guiadelcentrohistorico.mx/kmcero/1-el-centro-fondo/la-plaza-mayor-tres-siglos-de-dominaci-n-espa-ola|publisher=Nueva Guia del Centro Histórico de México|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a place for the poor and lower class of Mexico, usually racially mixed people, to mingle and purchase items for subsistence.

Ordenanzas, or official decrees, were established to regulate New Spanish society in general. The author’s 377 ordenanzas mimicked the official statutes, but would completely reverse the power system based on the [[Casta|sistema de castas]]. In effect, Chreslos Jache mocks the [[limpieza de sangre]] by creating a separate system of classification for Spaniards. For example, “medio Españoles” (half-Spanish) and “cuartilla de Español” (one-quarter Spanish) were parodies of terms to identify persons of mixed race, like “[[mestizo]]”, “[[castiza]]”, “[[Zambo|lobo]]”, and countless others.

The purpose of this manuscript was to show a chaotic view of life in Mexico in which the castas used a variety of strategies to substantiate their control over society and that the casta system itself is self-regulating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katzew|first=Ilona Katzew|title=Casta Painting|year=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0-300-10971-7|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chreslos Jache pokes fun at this idea of self-regulation by making up ridiculous names that are impossible to adequately translate for the terminology of the sistema de castas. The manuscript states that the sistema de castas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ruffin II|first=Herbert G.|title=Blackpast.org: Remembered and Reclaimed.|publisher=Blackpast.org|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was also mocked by the formation of the Baratillo “brotherhood” which was composed exclusively of non-whites, mainly [[mulatto]]s. This brotherhood banned membership to Spaniards and their descendants, and instead made them targets of the brotherhood’s scams. By using the Baratillo brotherhood, Chreslos Jache inverts the traditional racial attitude of the time where Spaniards and [[Criollo people|creole]]s dominated the system.

==Impact==

The manuscript reinforced race as a category of power differentiation within New Spain because it was a text that circulated among the educated elite in a time when primarily upper class people were literate. The significance of this satirical manuscript in relation to [[Casta]] paintings is that, much like the manuscript, the paintings reflect racial debate and also contribute to the interpretation of racial culture during the second half of the eighteenth-century in New Spain.

{{About||a comparison of parables with other stories|Traditional story|a geometrical figure with a similar name|Parabola}}

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn - Return of the Prodigal Son - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[The Return of the Prodigal Son]], by [[Rembrandt]].]]
A '''parable''' is  a succinct, [[Didacticism|didactic]] story, in [[prose]] or [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] that illustrates one or more instructive lessons or principles. It differs from a [[fable]] in that fables employ animals, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature as characters, whereas parables have human characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Difference Between Fable and Parable|url=http://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-fable-and-vs-parable/|website=DifferenceBetween.com|publisher=Difference Between|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A parable is a type of [[analogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VSjRcQSE2uQC&amp;pg=PA99 |title=What are they saying about the parables |author=David B. Gowler |year=2000 |work= What are they saying about the parables |pages=99,137,63,132,133, }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars of the [[canonical gospels]] and the [[New Testament]] apply the term "parable" only to the [[parables of Jesus]],&lt;ref name="Die Gleichnisreden Jesu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A Marginal Jew"&gt;[[John P. Meier]], ''[[A Marginal Jew]]'', volume II, Doubleday, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; though that is not a common restriction of the term. Parables such as "[[Parable of the Prodigal Son|The Prodigal Son]]" are central to Jesus's teaching method in the [[Biblical canon#New Testament|canonical narratives]] and the [[apocrypha]].

==Etymology==
The word ''parable'' comes from the  [[Greek language|Greek]] παραβολή (''parabolē''), meaning "comparison, illustration, analogy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dparabolh%2F παραβολή], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; It was the name given by Greek [[rhetorician]]s to an illustration in the form of a brief fictional [[narrative]].

==History==
Parables are often used to explore ethical concepts in [[Spirituality|spiritual]] texts. The [[Bible]] contains numerous parables in the [[Gospel]]s section of the [[New Testament]] ([[Parables of Jesus|Jesus's parables]]). These are believed by some scholars (such as [[John P. Meier]]) to have been inspired by [[Mashal (allegory)|mashal]]im, a form of Hebrew comparison.&lt;ref name="A Marginal Jew"/&gt; Examples of Jesus' parables include the [[Good Samaritan]] and the [[Prodigal Son]]. Mashalim from the [[Old Testament]] include the parable of the ewe-lamb (told by [[Nathan (Prophet)|Nathan]] in 2 Samuel 12:1-9&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=289892665 2 Samuel 12:1–9]&lt;/ref&gt;) and the parable of the woman of Tekoah (in 2 Samuel 14:1-13 &lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=2898925961 Samuel 14:1–13]&lt;/ref&gt;).

Parables also appear in [[Islam]].  In [[Sufi]] tradition, parables are used for imparting lessons and values. Recent authors such as [[Idries Shah]] and [[Anthony de Mello]] have helped popularize these stories beyond Sufi circles.

Modern parables also exist.  A mid-19th-century example, the [[Parable of the broken window]], criticises a part of [[Economics|economic]] thinking.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Jan Wijnants - Parable of the Good Samaritan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Parable of the Good Samaritan]], by [[Jan Wijnants]] (1670).]]

A parable is a short tale that illustrates a  universal truth; it is a simple [[narrative]]. It sketches a setting, describes an [[Action (philosophy)|action]], and shows the results. It may sometimes be distinguished from  similar narrative types, such as the [[allegory]] and the [[apologue]].&lt;ref name="fowler558"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of Modern English Usage |last=Fowler |first=H.W.|year=1965 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=London|page=558}} See entry at '''simile and metaphor'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A parable often involves a character who faces a [[morality|moral]] dilemma or one who makes a bad decision and then suffers the [[unintended consequences]]. Although the meaning of a parable is often not explicitly stated, it is not intended to be hidden or secret but to be quite straightforward and obvious.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Fyler Townsend]], in his translator's preface to ''[[Aesop's Fables]]'' (Belford, Clarke &amp; Co., 1887), defined the parable as being "purposely intended to convey a hidden and secret meaning other than that contained in the words themselves, and which may or may not bear a special reference to the hearer or reader." However, Townsend may have been influenced by the 19th century expression, "to speak in parables", connoting obscurity.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defining characteristic of the parable is the presence of a [[subtext]] suggesting how a person should behave or what he should believe. Aside from providing guidance and suggestions for proper conduct in one's life, parables frequently use [[metaphor]]ical language which allows people to more easily discuss difficult or complex ideas. Parables express an [[Abstract and concrete|abstract argument]] by means of using a concrete narrative which is easily understood.

The allegory is a more general narrative type; it also employs [[metaphor]]. Like the parable, the allegory makes a single, unambiguous point. An allegory may have multiple noncontradictory interpretations and may also have implications that are ambiguous or hard to interpret. As [[H.W. Fowler]] put it, the object of both parable and allegory "is to enlighten the hearer by submitting to him a case in which he has apparently no direct concern, and upon which therefore a disinterested judgment may be elicited from him, ..."&lt;ref name="fowler558"/&gt; The parable is more condensed than the allegory: it rests upon a single [[principle]] and a single moral, and it is intended that the reader or listener shall conclude that the moral applies equally well to his own concerns.

===Jesus' parables===
{{Main article|Parables of Jesus}}
[[Middle Ages|Medieval]] interpreters of the Bible often treated [[Jesus]]' parables as allegories, with symbolic [[correspondence (theology)|correspondence]]s found for every element in his parables. But modern scholars, beginning with [[Adolf Jülicher]], regard their interpretations as incorrect.&lt;ref name="Die Gleichnisreden Jesu"&gt;Adolf Jülicher, ''Die Gleichnisreden Jesu'' (2 vols; Tübingen: Mohr [Siebeck], 1888, 1899).&lt;/ref&gt; Jülicher held that Jesus' parables are intended to make a single important point, and most recent scholarship agrees.&lt;ref name="A Marginal Jew"/&gt;

[[Gnosticism|Gnostics]] suggested that Jesus kept some of his teachings secret within the circle of his disciples and that he deliberately obscured their meaning by using parables. For example, in [[Gospel of Mark|Mark 4:11–12]]:

{{Quotation|And he said to them, “To you has been given the secret of the [[kingdom of God]], but for those outside, everything comes in parables; in order that ‘they may indeed look, but not perceive, and may indeed listen, but not understand; so that they may not turn again and be [[Forgiveness|forgiven]].’” ([[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]])}}

===Other figures of speech===
The parable is related to [[Figure of speech|figures of speech]] such as the metaphor and the simile, but it should not be identified with them.

A parable is  like a metaphor in that it uses concrete, perceptible phenomena to illustrate abstract ideas. It may be said that a parable is a metaphor that has been extended to form a brief, coherent narrative.

A parable also resembles a [[simile]], i.e., a metaphorical construction in which something is said to be "like" something else (e.g., "The just man is like a tree planted by streams of water"). However, unlike the meaning of a simile, a parable's meaning is implicit (although not secret).

{{Spirituality sidebar |western}}
'''Perennial philosophy''' ({{lang-la|philosophia perennis}}),{{refn|group=note| more fully, ''philosophia perennis et universalis''; sometimes shortened to ''sophia perennis'' or ''religio perennis''}} also referred to as '''perennialism''' and '''perennial wisdom''', is a perspective in modern spirituality that views each of the world's religious traditions as sharing a single, metaphysical truth or origin from which all esoteric and exoteric knowledge and doctrine has grown.

Perennialism has its roots in the Renaissance interest in [[neo-Platonism]] and its [[Theory of Forms|idea]] of [[Neo-Platonism#The One|The One]], from which all existence emanates. [[Marsilio Ficino]] (1433–1499) sought to integrate ''[[Corpus Hermeticum|Hermeticism]]'' with Greek and Jewish-Christian thought,{{sfn|Slavenburg|Glaudemans|1994|p=395}} discerning a [[Prisca theologia]] which could be found in all ages.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=508}} [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] (1463–94) suggested that truth could be found in many, rather than just two, traditions. He proposed a harmony between the thought of Plato and Aristotle, and saw aspects of the ''Prisca theologia'' in [[Averroes]], the [[Koran]], the [[Kabbalah|Cabala]] and other sources.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=513}} [[Agostino Steuco]] (1497–1548) coined the term ''philosophia perennis''.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966}}

A more popular interpretation argues for [[universalism]], the idea that all religions, underneath seeming differences point to the same Truth. In the early 19th century the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalists]] propagated the idea of a metaphysical Truth and universalism, which inspired the [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], who proselytized among Indian elites. Towards the end of the 19th century, the [[Theosophical Society]] further popularized universalism, not only in the western world, but also in western colonies. In the 20th century universalism was further popularized in the English-speaking world through the [[neo-Vedanta]] inspired Traditionalist School, which argues for a metaphysical, single origin of the orthodox religions, and by [[Aldous Huxley]] and his book ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]'', which was inspired by [[neo-Vedanta]] and the Traditionalist School.

==Definition==

===Renaissance===
The idea of a perennial philosophy originated with a number of [[Renaissance]] theologians who took inspiration from [[neo-Platonism]] and from the [[theory of Forms]]. [[Marsilio Ficino]] (1433–1499) argued that there is an underlying unity to the world, the soul or love, which has a counterpart in the [[Theory of Forms|realm of ideas]].{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p= 508}} According to [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] (1463–1494), a student of Ficino, truth could be found in many, rather than just two, traditions.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p= 513}} According to [[Agostino Steuco]] (1497–1548) there is "one principle of all things, of which there has always been one and the same knowledge among all peoples."{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p= 517}}

===Traditionalist School===
The contemporary, scholarly oriented [[Traditionalist School]] continues this metaphysical orientation. According to the Traditionalist School, the perennial philosophy is "absolute Truth and infinite Presence."{{sfn|Lings|Minnaar|2007|p=xii}} Absolute Truth is "the perennial wisdom (''sophia perennis'') that stands as the transcendent source of all the intrinsically orthodox religions of humankind."{{sfn|Lings|Minnaar|2007|p=xii}} Infinite Presence is "the perennial religion (''religio perennis'') that lives within the heart of all intrinsically orthodox religions."{{sfn|Lings|Minnaar|2007|p=xii}} The Traditionalist School discerns a transcendent and an immanent dimension, namely the discernment of the Real or [[absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]], c.q. that which is permanent; and the intentional "mystical concentration on the Real."{{sfn|Lings|Minnaar|2007|p=xiii}}

According to Soares de Azevedo, the perennialist philosophy states that the universal truth is the same within each of the world's orthodox religious traditions, and is the foundation of their religious knowledge and doctrine. Each world religion is an interpretation of this universal truth, adapted to cater for the psychological, intellectual, and social needs of a given culture of a given period of history. This perennial truth has been rediscovered in each epoch by [[Mysticism|mystics]] of all kinds who have revived already existing religions, when they had fallen into empty platitudes and hollow ceremonialism.{{sfn|Soares de Azevedo|2005}}{{page needed|date=February 2017}}

Shipley further notes that the Traditionalist School is oriented on orthodox traditions, and rejects modern syncretism and universalism, which creates new religions from older religions and compromise the standing traditions.{{sfn|Shipley|2015|p=84}}

===Aldous Huxley and mystical universalism===
One such universalist was Aldous Huxley,{{sfn|Shipley|2015|p=84}} who propagated a universalist interpretation of the world religions, inspired by Vivekananda's [[neo-Vedanta]]. According to Aldous Huxley, who popularized the idea of a perennial philosophy with a larger audience,
{{quote|The Perennial Philosophy is expressed most succinctly in the Sanskrit formula, [[tat tvam asi]] ('That thou art'); the Atman, or immanent eternal Self, is one with Brahman, the Absolute Principle of all existence; and the last end of every human being, is to discover the fact for himself, to find out who he really is.{{sfn|Huxley|1945}}}}

In Huxley's 1944 essay in ''Vedanta and the West'', he describes ''The Minimum Working Hypothesis''; the basic outline of the perennial philosophy found in all the mystic branches of the religions of the world:

{{quote| That there is a Godhead or Ground, which is the unmanifested principle of all manifestation.

That the Ground is transcendent and immanent.

That it is possible for human beings to love, know and, from virtually, to become actually identified with the Ground.

That to achieve this unitive knowledge, to realize this supreme identity, is the final end and purpose of human existence.

That there is a Law or Dharma, which must be obeyed, a Tao or Way, which must be followed, if men are to achieve their final end.|}}

==Origins==
{{Main|Neo-Platonism|Agape}}

The perennial philosophy originates from a blending of neo-Platonism and [[Christianity]]. Neo-Platonism itself has diverse origins in the syncretic culture of the [[Hellenistic period]], and was an influential philosophy throughout the Middle Ages.

===Classical world===

====Hellenistic period: religious syncretism====
{{See also|Religious syncretism}}

During the [[Hellenistic period]], [[Alexander the Great]]'s [[Wars of Alexander the Great|campaigns]] brought about exchange of cultural ideas on its path throughout most of the known world of his era. The Greek [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] and [[Dionysian Mysteries]] mixed with such influences as the [[Cult of Isis]], [[Mithraism]] and [[Indo-Greeks|Hinduism]], along with some Persian influences. Such [[cross-cultural]] exchange was not new to the Greeks; the [[Egyptian god]] Osiris and the [[Greek god]] Dionysus had been equated as [[Osiris-Dionysus]] by the historian Herodotus as early as the 5th century BC (see [[Interpretatio graeca]]).{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1966|p=188-192}}{{sfn|McEvilley|2002}}

====Roman world: Philo of Alexandria====
[[Philo]] of Alexandria (c.25 BCE – c.50 CE) attempted to reconcile Greek Rationalism with the Torah, which helped pave the way for Christianity with [[Neo-Platonism]], and the adoption of the Old Testament with Christianity, as opposed to Gnostic Marcion roots of Christianity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Philo translated [[Judaism]] into terms of [[Stoicism|Stoic]], [[Platonism|Platonic]] and [[Neopythagorean]] elements, and held that God is "supra rational" and can be reached only through "ecstasy." He also held that the [[oracles]] of God supply the material of moral and religious knowledge.

====Neo-Platonism====
{{Main|Neoplatonism}}

Neoplatonism arose in the 3rd century CE and persisted until shortly after the closing of the [[Platonic Academy]] in Athens in AD 529 by [[Justinian I]]. Neoplatonists were heavily influenced by [[Plato]], but also by the Platonic tradition that thrived during the six centuries which separated the first of the Neoplatonists from Plato. The work of Neoplatonic philosophy involved describing the derivation of the whole of reality from a single principle, "the One." It was founded by [[Plotinus]],&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/neoplato/ ''IEP'']&lt;/ref&gt; and has been very influential throughout history. In the [[Middle Ages]], Neoplatonic ideas were integrated into the philosophical and theological works of many of the most important medieval Islamic, Christian, and Jewish thinkers.

===Renaissance===

====Ficino and Pico della Mirandola====
[[Marsilio Ficino]] (1433–1499) believed that [[Hermes Trismegistos]], the supposed author of the ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]'', was a contemporary of Mozes and the teacher of [[Pythagoras]], and the source of both Greek and Jewish-Christian thought.{{sfn|Slavenburg|Glaudemans|1994|p=395}} He argued that there is an underlying unity to the world, the soul or love, which has a counterpart in the realm of ideas. Platonic Philosophy and Christian theology both embody this truth. Ficino was influenced by a variety of philosophers including Aristotelian [[Scholasticism]] and various pseudonymous and mystical writings. Ficino saw his thought as part of a long development of philosophical truth, of ancient pre-Platonic philosophers (including [[Zoroaster]], [[Hermes Trismegistus]], [[Orpheus]], Aglaophemus and [[Pythagoras]]) who reached their peak in Plato. The [[Prisca theologia]], or venerable and ancient theology, which embodied the truth and could be found in all ages, was a vitally important idea for Ficino.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=508}}

[[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] (1463–94), a student of Ficino, went further than his teacher by suggesting that truth could be found in many, rather than just two, traditions. This proposed a harmony between the thought of Plato and Aristotle, and saw aspects of the ''Prisca theologia'' in [[Averroes]], the [[Koran]], the [[Kabbalah|Cabala]] among other sources.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=513}} After the deaths of Pico and Ficino this line of thought expanded, and included [[Symphorien Champier]], and [[Francesco Giorgio]].

====Steuco====

=====De perenni philosophia libri X=====
The term ''perenni philosophia'' was first used by [[Agostino Steuco]] (1497–1548) who used it to title a treatise, ''De perenni philosophia libri X'', published in 1540.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966}} ''De perenni philosophia'' was the most sustained attempt at philosophical synthesis and harmony.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=515}} Steuco represents the liberal wing of 16th-century Biblical scholarship and theology, although he rejected Luther and Calvin.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=516}} ''De perenni philosophia'', is a complex work which only contains the term philosophia perennis twice. It states that there is "one principle of all things, of which there has always been one and the same knowledge among all peoples."&lt;ref&gt;''De perenni philosophia Bk 1'', Ch 1; folio 1 in Schmitt (1966) P.517&lt;/ref&gt; This single knowledge (or sapientia) is the key element in his philosophy. In that he emphasises continuity over progress, Steuco's idea of philosophy is not one conventionally associated with the [[Renaissance]]. Indeed, he tends to believe that the truth is lost over time and is only preserved in the [[Prisca theologia|prisci theologica]]. Steuco preferred Plato to Aristotle and saw greater congruence between the former and Christianity than the latter philosopher. He held that philosophy works in harmony with religion and should lead to knowledge of God, and that truth flows from a single source, more ancient than the Greeks. Steuco was strongly influenced by [[Iamblichus]]'s statement that knowledge of God is innate in all,&lt;ref&gt;''Jamblichi De mysteriis liber'', ed. Gustavus Parthey (Berlin), I, 3; 7-10&lt;/ref&gt; and also gave great importance to Hermes Trismegistus.

=====Influence=====
Steuco's perennial philosophy was highly regarded by some scholars for the two centuries after its publication, then largely forgotten until it was rediscovered by Otto Willmann in the late part of the 19th century.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=516}} Overall, ''De perenni philosophia'' wasn't particularly influential, and largely confined to those with a similar orientation to himself. The work was not put on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index]] of works banned by the Roman Catholic Church, although his ''Cosmopoeia'' which expressed similar ideas was. Religious criticisms tended to the conservative view that held Christian teachings should be understood as unique, rather than seeing them as perfect expressions of truths that are found everywhere.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=527}} More generally, this philosophical [[syncretism]] was set out at the expense of some of the doctrines included within it, and it is possible that Steuco's critical faculties were not up to the task he had set himself. Further, placing so much confidence in the prisca theologia, turned out to be a shortcoming as many of the texts used in this school of thought later turned out to be bogus.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=524}} In the following two centuries the most favourable responses were largely Protestant and often in England.

[[Gottfried Leibniz]] later picked up on Steuco's term. The German philosopher stands in the tradition of this concordistic philosophy; his [[Pre-established harmony|philosophy of harmony]] especially had affinity with Steuco's ideas. Leibniz knew about Steuco's work by 1687, but thought that ''De la Verite de la Religion Chretienne'' by Huguenot philosopher [[Phillippe du Plessis-Mornay]] expressed the same truth better. Steuco's influence can be found throughout Leibniz's works, but the German was the first philosopher to refer to the perennial philosophy without mentioning the Italian.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=530-531}}

==Popularisation==

===Transcendentalism and Unitarian Universalism===

[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (1803–1882) was a pioneer of the idea of spirituality as a distinct field.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Leigh Eric. ''Restless Souls : The Making of American Spirituality''. San Francisco: Harper, 2005. {{ISBN|0-06-054566-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the major figures in [[Transcendentalism]], an early 19th-century [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Protestant]] movement, which was rooted in English and German [[Romanticism]], the Biblical criticism of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Schleiermacher]], and the [[skepticism]] of [[David Hume|Hume]].&lt;ref group=web name="Stanford"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/transcendentalism/ Stanford Encyclopdeia of Philosophy, ''Transcendentalism'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Transcendentalists emphasised an intuitive, experiential approach of religion.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis"&gt;[http://www.transcendentalists.com/what.htm Jone John Lewis, ''What is Transcendentalism?"]&lt;/ref&gt; Following Schleiermacher,{{sfn|Sharf|1995}} an individual's intuition of truth was taken as the criterion for truth.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis" /&gt; In the late 18th and early 19th century, the first translations of Hindu texts appeared, which were also read by the Transcendentalists, and influenced their thinking.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis" /&gt; They also endorsed [[Universalism|universalist]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarianist]] ideas, leading to [[Unitarian Universalism]], the idea that there must be truth in other religions as well, since a loving God would redeem all living beings, not just Christians.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis" /&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="Andrews"&gt;[http://archive.uua.org/re/other/andrews.html Barry Andrews, ''THE ROOTS OF UNITARIAN UNIVERSALIST SPIRITUALITY IN NEW ENGLAND TRANSCENDENTALISM ''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054734/http://archive.uua.org/re/other/andrews.html |date=2013-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theosophical Society===
{{main|Theosophical Society}}

By the end of the 19th century, the idea of a perennial philosophy was popularized by leaders of the Theosophical Society such as [[H. P. Blavatsky]] and [[Annie Besant]], under the name of "Wisdom-Religion" or "Ancient Wisdom".&lt;ref name="key"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Theosophical Society took an active interest in Asian religions, subsequently not only bringing those religions under the attention of a western audience but also influencing Hinduism and Buddhism in Sri Lanka and Japan.

===Neo-Vedanta===
{{Main|Advaita Vedanta|Neo-Vedanta|Hinduism in the West|Neo-Advaita}}

Many perennialist thinkers (including Armstrong, Huston Smith and [[Joseph Campbell]]) are influenced by Hindu reformer [[Ram Mohan Roy]] and Hindu mystics [[Ramakrishna]] and [[Swami Vivekananda]],&lt;ref&gt;Prothero p.166&lt;/ref&gt; who themselves have taken over western notions of universalism.{{sfn|King|2002}} They regarded Hinduism to be a token of this perennial philosophy. This notion has influenced thinkers who have proposed versions of the perennial philosophy in the 20th century.{{sfn|King|2002}}

The unity of all religions was a central impulse among Hindu reformers in the 19th century, who in turn influenced many 20th-century perennial philosophy-type thinkers. Key figures in this reforming movement included two Bengali Brahmins. [[Ram Mohan Roy]], a philosopher and the founder of the modernising [[Brahmo Samaj]] religious organisation, reasoned that the divine was beyond description and thus that no religion could claim a monopoly in their understanding of it.

The mystic [[Ramakrishna]]'s spiritual ecstasies included experiencing the sameness of Christ, Mohammed and his own Hindu deity. Ramakrishna's most famous disciple, [[Swami Vivekananda]], travelled to the United States in the 1890s where he formed the [[Vedanta Society]].

Roy, Ramakrishna and Vivekananda were all influenced by the Hindu school of [[Advaita Vedanta]],&lt;ref&gt;Prothero, Stephen (2010) ''God is Not One: The Eight Rival Religions That Run the World—and Why Their Differences Matter'', p. 165-6, HarperOne, {{ISBN|0-06-157127-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they saw as the exemplification of a Universalist Hindu religiosity.{{sfn|King|2002}}

===Traditionalist School===
{{Main|Traditionalist School}}

The Traditionalist School was a group of 20th century thinkers concerned with what they considered to be the demise of traditional forms of knowledge, both aesthetic and spiritual, within Western society. The principal thinkers in this tradition are [[René Guénon]], [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] and [[Frithjof Schuon]].  Other important thinkers in this tradition include [[Titus Burckhardt]], [[Martin Lings]], [[Jean-Louis Michon]], [[Marco Pallis]], [[Huston Smith]], [[Hossein Nasr]], [[Jean Borella]], [[Elémire Zolla]]. According to the Traditionalist School, orthodox religions are based on a singular metaphysical origin. According to the Traditionalist School, the "philosophia perennis" designates a worldview that is opposed to the [[scientism]] of modern [[secular]] societies and which promotes the rediscovery of the wisdom traditions of the pre-secular [[developed world]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} This view is exemplified by [[Rene Guenon]] in his ''magnum opus'' and one of the founding works of the [[traditionalist school]], ''[[The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times]]''.

According to [[Frithjof Schuon]]:
{{quote|It has been said more than once that total Truth is inscribed in an eternal script in the very substance of our spirit; what the different Revelations do is to "crystallize" and "actualize", in different degrees according to the case, a nucleus of certitudes which not only abides forever in the divine Omniscience, but also sleeps by refraction in the "naturally supernatural" kernel of the individual, as well as in that of each ethnic or historical collectivity or of the human species as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;''The Essential Writings of Frithjof Schuon,'' Suhayl Academy, Lahore, 2001, p.67.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Aldous Huxley===
{{See also|The Perennial Philosophy}}

The term was popularized in more recent times by [[Aldous Huxley]], who was profoundly influenced by [[Swami Vivekananda|Vivekananda's]] [[Neo-Vedanta]] and [[Universalism]].{{sfn|Roy|2003}} In his 1945 book ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]'' he defined the perennial philosophy as:
{{quote|... the [[metaphysic]] that recognizes a divine Reality substantial to the world of things and lives and minds; the [[psychology]] that finds in the soul something similar to, or even identical to, divine Reality; the [[ethic]] that places man's final end in the knowledge of the [[Immanence|immanent]] and [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] [[Ground of being|Ground of all being]]; the thing is immemorial and universal. Rudiments of the perennial philosophy may be found among the traditional lore of primitive peoples in every region of the world, and in its fully developed forms it has a place in every one of the higher religions.{{sfn|Huxley|1945|p=vii}}}}

In contrast to the Traditionalist school, Huxley emphasized [[mystical experience]] over metaphysics:
{{quote|The Buddha declined to make any statement in regard to the ultimate divine Reality. All he would talk about was Nirvana, which is the name of the [[Phenomenology of religion|experience that comes to]] the totally selfless and one-pointed [...] Maintaining, in this matter, the attitude of a strict operationalist, the Buddha would speak only of the spiritual experience, not of the metaphysical entity presumed by the theologians of other religions, as also of later Buddhism, to be the object and (since in contemplation the knower, the known and the knowledge are all one) at the same time the subject and substance of that experience.{{sfn|Huxley|1945}}}}

According to Aldous Huxley, in order to apprehend the divine reality, one must choose to fulfill certain conditions: "making themselves loving, pure in heart and poor in spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Aldous. The perennial philosophy . [1st ed. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1945. p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley argues that very few people can achieve this state.  Those who have fulfilled these conditions, grasped the universal truth and interpreted it have generally been given the name of saint, prophet, sage or enlightened one.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Aldous. The perennial philosophy . [1st ed. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1945. p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley argues that those who have, "modified their merely human mode of being," and have thus been able to comprehend "more than merely human kind and amount of knowledge" have also achieved this enlightened state.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Aldous. The perennial philosophy . [1st ed. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1945. p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Age===
{{Main|New Age|New Age Movement}}

The idea of a perennial philosophy is central to the New Age Movement. The New Age movement is a [[Western culture|Western]] [[spirituality|spiritual]] movement that developed in the second half of the 20th century. Its central precepts have been described as "drawing on both Eastern and Western spiritual and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] traditions and infusing them with influences from [[self-help]] and motivational [[psychology]], [[holistic health]], [[parapsychology]], consciousness research and [[quantum physics]]".{{sfn|Drury|2004|p=12}} The term ''New Age'' refers to the coming [[astrological age|astrological]] [[Age of Aquarius]].&lt;ref group=web name="JGMelton"/&gt;

The New Age aims to create "a spirituality without borders or confining dogmas" that is inclusive and [[religious pluralism|pluralistic]].{{sfn |Drury|2004 | p=8}} It holds to "a holistic worldview",{{sfn |Drury|2004 | p=11}} emphasising that the [[dialectical monism|Mind, Body and Spirit]] are interrelated&lt;ref group=web name="JGMelton"&gt;Melton, J. Gordon – Director Institute for the Study of American Religion. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060614001357/http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/newage.html New Age Transformed], retrieved 2006-06&lt;/ref&gt; and that there is a form of [[monism]] and unity throughout the universe.&lt;ref name="Langone"&gt;Michael D. Langone, Ph.D. Cult Observer, 1993, Volume 10, No. 1. [http://www.csj.org/rg/rgessays/rgessay_newage.htm What Is "New Age"?], retrieved 2006-07&lt;/ref&gt; It attempts to create "a worldview that includes both science and spirituality"{{sfn |Drury|2004 | p=10}} and embraces a number of forms of [[mainstream science]] as well as other forms of science that are considered [[Fringe science|fringe]].

==Academic discussions==

===Mystical experience===
{{Main|Mystical experience}}

The idea of a perennial philosophy, sometimes called perennialism, is a key area of debate in the academic discussion of mystical experience. Huston Smith notes that the Traditionalist School's vision of a perennial philosophy is not based on mystical experiences, but on metaphysical intuitions.{{sfn|Smith|1987|p=554}} The discussion of mystical experience has shifted the emphasis in the perennial philosophy from these metaphysical intuitions to religious experience{{sfn|Smith|1987|p=554}} and the notion of [[nonduality]] or [[altered state of consciousness]].

[[William James]] popularized the use of the term "religious experience" in his ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]''.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}} It has also influenced the understanding of mysticism as a distinctive experience which supplies knowledge.&lt;ref group=web name="StanfordMysticism"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mysticism/ Gellman, Jerome, "Mysticism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)]&lt;/ref&gt; Writers such as [[Walter Terence Stace|WT Stace]], [[Huston Smith]], and [[Robert K.C. Forman|Robert Forman]] argue that there are core similarities to mystical experience across religions, cultures and eras.&lt;ref&gt;Wildman, Wesley J. (2010) ''Religious Philosophy as Multidisciplinary Comparative Inquiry: Envisioning a Future for the Philosophy of Religion'', p. 49, SUNY Press, {{ISBN|1-4384-3235-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Stace the universality of this core experience is a necessary, although not sufficient, condition for one to be able to trust the cognitive content of any religious experience.{{sfn|Prothero|2010|p=6}}{{check source|date=February 2017}}

[[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of "religious experience" further back to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of "religious experience" was used by Schleiermacher to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique. It was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p=271}}

Critics point out that the emphasis on "experience" favours the atomic individual, instead of the community. It also fails to distinguish between episodic experience, and mysticism as a process, embedded in a total religious matrix of liturgy, scripture, worship, virtues, theology, rituals and practices.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=4-5}} Richard King also points to disjunction between "mystical experience" and social justice:{{sfn|King|2002|p=21}}
{{quote|The privatisation of mysticism - that is, the increasing tendency to locate the mystical in the psychological realm of personal experiences - serves to exclude it from political issues such as social justice. Mysticism thus comes to be seen as a personal matter of cultivating inner states of tranquility and equanimity, which, rather than serving to transform the world, reconcile the individual to the status quo by alleviating anxiety and stress.{{sfn|King|2002|p=21}}}}

===Religious pluralism===
{{Main|Religious pluralism}}

[[Religious pluralism]] holds that various world religions are limited by their distinctive historical and cultural contexts and thus there is no single, true religion.  There are only many equally valid religions. Each religion is a direct result of humanity's attempt to grasp and understand the incomprehensible divine reality. Therefore, each religion has an authentic but ultimately inadequate perception of divine reality, producing a partial understanding of the universal truth, which requires syncretism to achieve a complete understanding as well as a path towards salvation or spiritual enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Livingston, James. "Religious Pluralism and the Question of Religious Truth in Wilfred C. Smith." The Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory 4, no. 3 (2003): pp.58-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although perennial philosophy also holds that there is no single true religion, it differs when discussing divine reality. Perennial philosophy states that the divine reality is what allows the universal truth to be understood.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden, John Stephen. "Perennial Philosophy and Christianity." In Christianity: the complete guide . London: Continuum, 2005. pp.1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each religion provides its own interpretation of the universal truth, based on its historical and cultural context.  Therefore, each religion provides everything required to observe the divine reality and achieve a state in which one will be able to confirm the universal truth and achieve salvation or spiritual enlightenment.

A '''prank call''' (also known as a '''crank call''', '''phony call''' or '''hoax call''') is a telephone [[practical joke]]. Prank phone calls began to gain a worldwide following since the invention of telephones, as they became a staple of the obscure and amusing [[cassette tape]]s traded among musicians, [[sound engineer]]s, and media traders beginning in the late 1970s. Among the most famous and earliest recorded prank calls are the [[Tube Bar prank calls]] tapes, which centered on [[Louis "Red" Deutsch]]. Comedian [[Jerry Lewis]] was an incorrigible phone prankster, and recordings of his hijinks, dating from the 1960s and possibly earlier, still circulate to this day.

Very prominent people have fallen victim to prank callers, for example [[Elizabeth II]], who was fooled by Canadian DJ [[Pierre Brassard]] posing as Canadian Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]], asking her to record a speech in support of Canadian unity ahead of the [[1995 Quebec referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | author2= | title=Hoaxing: A national pastime | date=2000-01-25 |publisher=BBC | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/618065.stm | work =BBC News | accessdate = 2007-09-15 | quote = In 1995, Canadian DJ Pierre Brassard got through to [[Buckingham Palace]] pretending to be Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien. He chatted to the Queen for 15 minutes on air – eliciting a promise that she would try to influence [[Quebec]]'s [[referendum]] on proposals to break away from Canada – and she never realised it was a hoax.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other notable examples of prank calls were made by the Miami-based radio station [[WLZL|Radio El Zol]]. In one, they telephoned Venezuelan president [[Hugo Chávez]], and spoke to him pretending to be Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Chavez falls for Castro hoax | date=2003-01-08 &lt;!-- 02:57 GMT --&gt; | publisher=BBC | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2637395.stm | work =BBC News | accessdate = 2007-09-15 | quote = A radio station in the American state of Florida Hasplayed a practical joke on President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela with a hoax phone call he believed was from his friend and ally, the Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Two presenters at Radio El Zol, in Miami, called Mr. Chavez on a private line and used taped extracts of Mr Castro's voice to make him think it was the communist leader himself on the phone.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They later reversed the prank, calling Castro and pretending to be Chávez. Castro began swearing at the pranksters live on air after they revealed themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/fidel/transcript.htm|title=Transcript of Castro's prank call|first=Tony de la|last=Cova|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anonymity ==
Prank callers can now be easily found through [[Caller ID]], so it is often asserted that since the 1990s, prank calls have been harder to accomplish and thus waning in popularity.&lt;ref name="vanishing"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2014/06/14/the-vanishing-underappreciated-prank-call/yNo0aIoOo5yXeadKt8EmsI/story.html|title=The vanishing, underappreciated prank call - The Boston Globe|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most telephone companies permit callers to withhold the identifying information from calls using the [[vertical service code]] [[*67]] that blocks the caller's ID (141 in the UK), but potential victims may be reluctant to answer a call from an ID-blocked number.&lt;ref name="vanishing" /&gt; [[Wiretapping]] by several governments have also made prank calls easier to trace. Callers can also call from [[payphones]] in order to hide their identity, although this is becoming less common as pay phones are beginning to phase out starting in the late 2000s. The advent and advancements in digital switching technologies such as those found in [[Signalling System No. 7|SS7]], unspoofable [[Automatic number identification|ANI]], as well as outbound and inbound calls being logged at [[telephone exchange|carrier exchange]] equipment, further complicate the pranksters will to remain anonymous while carrying out such activities.

Another increasingly popular option is to use some form of [[VoIP]]. With some VoIP services, the telephone number will simply not exist. These calls are extremely difficult to trace since they may pass through servers and routers operated by multiple corporations or entities in various countries. Although law enforcement agencies may theoretically be able to find where a [[VoIP]] call originates from if they tried, in practice the amount of time, effort, and resources required would be too great to use on ordinary prank calls.

== Political leaders ==
Sometimes, prank callers are able to connect with political leaders. In December 2005, a commercially operated radio station in Spain ([[COPE (radio station)|COPE]] – owned by a series of institutions affiliated with the Catholic Church) played a prank on Bolivian president-elect [[Evo Morales]]. The hoaxster pretended to be Spanish Prime Minister [[José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero]], congratulating Morales on his election&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quepasa.com/english/news/latinamerica/Zapatero.Morales.prank/406542.html |title=Prank call to Evo Morales |access-date=September 10, 2016}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}{{dead link|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and saying things like, "I imagine the only one not to have called you was George Bush. I've been here two years and he still hasn't called me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informativos.telecinco.es/cope/zapatero/broma_morales/dn_17521.htm|title=Noticias, última hora en Informativos Telecinco|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prank calls and the Internet ==
Ever since the opportunity has been available, there have been multiple internet radio stations dedicated to prank calls. Most of them feature a so-called "rotation" of prank calls, which is a constant broadcast of various prank calls submitted by the community, usually streamed from a [[SHOUTcast]] server host. Software such as [[Ventrilo]] has allowed prank calls to be carried out to a more private user-base, however, in real-time.

The internet has allowed many people to share their own personal prank calls and develop into communities. Prank calls can be carried out in many ways; live or pre-recorded. Sites such as [[Stickam]] and [[Ustream]] allow hosts to carry out prank calls live to thousands of listeners, who can also chat and discuss on-goings in real-time. The use of [[social networking]] and the popularity of [[user generated content]] also allows these prank calls to spread and popularity to grow. 

== Legal issues ==
Some prank calls are criminalized in many jurisdictions, for instance if the call involves calling the emergency services, while others may be protected as [[freedom of expression]].  For example, in the US, for a prank call to fall afoul of the Telecommunications Act, {{uscsub|47|223|a|1}}, the call must be done with the intent to "abuse, threaten, or harass". In Australia, the 2Day FM incident is alleged by ACMA to have violated Australian law, but on the grounds that the recorded call was publicly broadcast without the other party's consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=India-born nurse's death: Watchdog finds radio station guilty | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-09-20/other-news/42251296_1_radio-station-mel-greig-jacintha-saldanha | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130927161026/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-09-20/other-news/42251296_1_radio-station-mel-greig-jacintha-saldanha | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2013-09-27 | work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudimentary criminal 'pranks' may range from simple [[telephone harassment]] to [[bomb threats]]. One such hoax call occurred in [[Perth]], Western Australia, on New Year's Eve 2002, when a drunk teenager called the new anti-terrorist hot line to report a bomb threat against the New Year's Eve fireworks celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ag.gov.au/agd/WWW/attorneygeneralHome.nsf/Page/Media_Releases_2003_January_2003_WA_man_charged_over_hoax_hotline_call_(1_January_2003) |title= Perth, Australia bomb threat hoax |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504182614/http://www.ag.gov.au/agd/WWW/attorneygeneralHome.nsf/Page/Media_Releases_2003_January_2003_WA_man_charged_over_hoax_hotline_call_(1_January_2003) |archivedate=May 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The threat was taken seriously, and the celebrations were about to be cancelled when police discovered that no such threat existed. The teenager was then arrested for the false report.

More elaborate pranks rely on tricking the recipient into harmful behavior. An example of these was the 1996–2004 [[strip search phone call scam]], in which a prankster posing as a police officer was able to cause store managers to [[strip search]] female employees. More recently, the [[Pranknet]] [[virtual community]] has been credited for causing tens of thousands of dollars in damage to many hotels and [[fast food restaurant]]s. Posing as [[Authority|authority figures]], such as [[fire alarm]] company representatives and hotel corporate managers, Pranknet participants called unsuspecting employees and customers in the United States via [[Skype]] and tricked them into damaging property, setting off [[fire sprinkler]]s and other humiliating acts such as disrobing. They also post fraudulent ads on [[Craigslist]], and then shout racial epithets and make violent threats of rape and murder against the people who call them to respond to the ads. Pranknet members listen in real-time and discuss the progress together in a private [[chat room]]. The group, who flaunted their anonymity, were outed when editors of ''[[The Smoking Gun]]'', posing as journalists, persuaded them to visit unique URLs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2009/0803091pranknet1.html Telephone Terrorist] The Smoking Gun, August 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of prank calls by Joseph Sherer led to convictions and a twenty-year prison sentence for impersonating a physician, criminal endangerment, and [[aggravated assault]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-01-21/news/0001201213_1_mutilation-mclane-bozeman|title=Caller Prompted Mutilation, Police Say |newspaper=Sun-Sentinel |location=Ft.

The victim's obedient actions flowed directly from Sherer's instructions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/mt-supreme-court/1314983.html|title=STATE of Montana, Plaintiff and Respondent, v.

Until his death in 2011, Oklahoma construction worker Frank Garrett was prank called and recorded countless times for his vitriolic reactions. The [[Soundboard (computer program)|soundboard]] community that followed him caused at least three known incidents with the law: two in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] and a third in [[Houston]]; both were for threats of violence against residents and the police with his name being used in the process. Both incidents were covered by local [[FOX News]] stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|title=Frank Garrett (Aka Duncan) has died July 3, 2011|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmb5775DLGQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.examiner.net/article/20100223/NEWS/302239712|last=Glover|first=Michael|title=Angry, threatening calls alarm Sugar Creek|date=February 23, 2010|accessdate=January 22, 2014|publisher=[[GateHouse Media]]|newspaper=[[The Examiner (Missouri)|The Examiner]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202104541/http://www.myfoxhouston.com/story/18232189/caller-threatens-to-blow-up-hpd|url=http://www.myfoxhouston.com/story/18232189/caller-threatens-to-blow-up-hpd|title=Caller Threatens to Blow Up HPD|date=April 26, 2011| accessdate=January 22, 2014|archivedate=February 2, 2014|publisher=[[KRIV (TV)|Fox 26 News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pulley|first=Mary|title=Man makes repeated threatening, obscene phone calls to people in Independence|url=http://fox4kc.com/2014/12/08/woman-worried-by-threatening-obscene-phone-calls-made-to-her-home/|publisher=[[WDAF-TV|Fox 4KC]]|date=December 9, 2014|accessdate=September 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{Main|Suicide of Jacintha Saldanha}}

In 2012, Jacintha Saldanha, a nurse at [[King Edward VII's Hospital Sister Agnes|King Edward VII hospital]] who was attending a pregnant [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]], was deceived into transferring a prank call from [[Mel Greig]] and [[Mike Christian]], the hosts of the ''[[Hot30 Countdown]]'' radio program broadcast on [[2Day FM]] in Sydney, Australia, who were impersonating [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]. The hoaxsters were able to ask the duty nurse questions about the duchess' health, making the answers public. Saldanha was later found dead in a suspected suicide. The incident and the following death received intense media coverage and triggered an investigation, but no charges were laid.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9731359/Cruel-hospital-hoax-still-playing-on-radio.html |title='Cruel' hospital hoax still playing on radio|author=Gordon Rayner |work=The Daily Telegraph |date= 8 December 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20130202StuffCoNz&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/europe/8254302/No-charges-for-royal-hoaxters |title=No charges for royal hoaxters |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=2 February 2013 | accessdate=2 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prank calls frequently appear in many earlier episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', as [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] calls [[Moe's Tavern]] asking for people whose names are actually double entendres. Examples include "Mike Rotch" (my crotch), "Bea O'Problem" ([[Body odor|B.O.]] problem), "Al Coholic" (alcoholic), "Amanda Hugginkiss" (a man to hug and kiss), and "Anita Bath" (I need a bath). [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]] then asks his clientele if the person is present, embarrassing himself in the process. However, in the episode "[[Flaming Moe's]]", Bart's prank call backfires when he calls up asking for a "Hugh Jass" (huge ass), only for a man with the same name to answer. And in "[[Donnie Fatso]]", [[Fat Tony (The Simpsons)|Fat Tony]] accidentally calls Moe asking for his business partner, "Yuri Nator" (urinator).

[["Weird Al" Yankovic]]'s song "Phony Calls" (a parody of "[[Waterfalls (TLC song)|Waterfalls]]" by [[TLC (group)|TLC]], featured on his 1996 album ''[[Bad Hair Day]]'') deals with prank phone calls. Specifically, it talks about the "Is your refrigerator running?" gag and the "Do you have Prince Albert in a can?" gag. It also incorporates Bart Simpson's aforementioned "Mike Rotch" prank phone call. 

On an episode of ''[[Pee-Wee's Playhouse]]'', the mischievous Randy makes a prank call (the classic "Is your refrigerator running? Then you better catch it!" gag) and talks Pee-Wee into doing so also. The recipient of the call is irritated and gets her husband on the phone, who happens to be a police officer. The officer sternly warns Pee-Wee that making prank calls is against the law and that it can result in going to jail and a lifetime criminal record.

The [[Cartoon Network]] series ''[[Regular Show]]'' featured an episode centered around prank calls in its first season, entitled "Prank Callers". Inspired by watching online videos of the "world's best prank caller", the show's protagonists, Mordecai and Rigby, attempt to make several prank calls of their own. After the two fail to prank the world's best prank caller, they are sent back in time to 1982, and are later joined by the rest of the show's main cast. The episode then focuses on the group's efforts to return to their proper time period, by pranking the aforementioned prank caller. in the episode entitled "House Rules" Benson decrees a series of dubious rules. one of which forbids the use of making prank calls, causing Mordecai and Rigby to abandon him of their own free will. Later on, Mordecai receives a prank call(the classic, but derogatory "Loser says what?" prank). Mordecai attempts to dismiss the caller, but inadvertently falls for it.

In John Carpenter's spooky thriller, ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', during the scene when [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] appears before Lynda while disguising himself as her boyfriend, Bob, in a ghost costume, and she teases him before calling Laurie, during which Michael strangles her, Laurie thinks it's just Annie making another prank call. 

Prank calls are common in morning radio talk shows with a comedy theme, radio broadcasts a Carmen Prank Call will occur, where "Carmen" calls random people and annoys them to the point of them hanging up, irritated, once, and after a second call, twice. Prank calls are generally done for the amusement of the pranksters (and their listening audiences). Some performers such as [[The Jerky Boys]], [[Tom Mabe]] and [[Roy D. Mercer]] made a name for themselves producing albums of their recorded prank calls.

The [[Nickelodeon]] series ''[[Spongebob SquarePants]]'' features an episode in which SpongeBob is distracted by a prank call, before realizing he could fly as a result of his hair dryer being stuck in his pants. SpongeBob receives a prank call from someone asking for "The Birdman of Bikini Bottom", before asking SpongeBob if he lived in a birdcage, annoying him to the point of asking him who's calling him, before being given a joke name (The Classic "Joe Mama" gag), before SpongeBob admonishes the caller and hangs up.

[[Sal "the Stockbroker" Governale]] and [[Richard Christy]], writers on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', have made various prank calls to [[public access]] shows, [[talk radio]], radio stations, and normal people at home. They also have a fictional radio show called the "Jack and Rod show" where they call a major celebrity for an interview and prank them with sound effects or fake guests such as [[Bruce Morrow|Cousin Brucie]] (where Howard imitates a famous radio host while using an exaggerated version of his signature speech patterns) and many other pranks.

The television show ''[[Crank Yankers]]'' is a series of real-life prank calls made by celebrities and re-enacted on-screen by [[puppet]]s for a humorous effect.

''[[Fonejacker]]'', a show started on April 5, 2007 on [[E4 (channel)|E4]], stars [[Kayvan Novak]] performing prank calls to the general public and being shown with animated pictures in a [[Monty Python]] style with their mouths moving and live recordings as the victim receives the call.

Beginning in early 2011, the image board [[4chan]] organized a prank calling of the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], location of the popular television show ''[[Pawn Stars]]''. The callers repeatedly asked the employees if they sold ''[[Battletoads]]'', a video game for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] notorious for its difficulty. This call led Rick, star of ''Pawn Stars'' and owner of the store, to repeatedly swear and yell at the prank callers. The 4chan callers recorded this and uploaded it to [[YouTube]], and subsequently many videos related to prank callers dialing random establishments and asking about ''Battletoads'' have been uploaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ReadyToPrank|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpmWNpUZmcA|website=YouTube|publisher=ReadyToPrank|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=PrankCallsByReV|title=Prank Call ReV Calls (Pawn Stars) Rick Harrison Cellphone # "Battletoads"|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ3yTVkL7bQ|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prank Website|url=https://www.ownagepranks.com|website=OwnagePranks|publisher=OwnagePranks|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Swanage Punch &amp; Judy.JPG|thumb|A traditional Punch and Judy booth, at [[Swanage]], Dorset, England]]

'''Punch and Judy''' is a traditional [[puppet]] show featuring Mr. Punch and his wife Judy. The performance consists of a sequence of short scenes, each depicting an interaction between two characters, most typically Mr. Punch and one other character who usually falls victim to Punch's slap stick. It is often associated with traditional [[British culture]].&lt;ref name="British seaside" /&gt; The various episodes of Punch comedy—often provoking shocked laughter—are dominated by the clowning of Mr. Punch.&lt;ref name="350 years"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mr Punch celebrates 350 years of puppet anarchy|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17895716|agency=BBC|date=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show is performed by a single puppeteer inside the booth, known since Victorian times as a "professor" or "punchman", and assisted sometimes by a "bottler" who corrals the audience outside the booth, introduces the performance, and collects the money ("the bottle"). The bottler might also play accompanying music or sound effects on a drum or guitar, and engage in back chat with the puppets, sometimes repeating lines that may have been difficult for the audience to understand. In Victorian times, the drum and [[pan pipe]]s were the instruments of choice. Today, the audience is also encouraged to participate, calling out to the characters on the stage to warn them of danger or clue them in to what is going on behind their backs. Also nowadays, most professors work solo, since the need for a bottler became less important when [[busking]] with the show gave way to paid engagements at private parties or public events.

The Punch and Judy show has roots in the 16th-century Italian [[commedia dell'arte]]. The figure of Punch is derived from the [[Naples|Neapolitan]] stock character of [[Pulcinella]], which was [[anglicized]] to ''Punchinello''.&lt;ref name="eb1911-punch"&gt;{{cite EB1911|last=Wheeler|first=R. Mortimer|wstitle=Punch (puppet)|title=Punch|volume=22|pages=648–649}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a manifestation of the [[Lord of Misrule]] and [[Trickster]] figures of deep-rooted mythologies. Punch's wife was originally called "Joan."
[[File:Punch Plaque Covent Garden.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Plaque commemorating the first recorded performance of Punch and Judy on [[St Paul's, Covent Garden|St Paul's]] in [[Covent Garden]]]]

The figure who later became Mr. Punch made his first recorded appearance in England on 9 May 1662, which is traditionally reckoned as Punch's UK birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Watson. [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2141622/Thats-way-Mr-Punch-celebrates-350-years-recorded-time-diary-Samuel-Pepys.html "That's the way to do it! Mr Punch celebrate 350 years since being recorded for the first time in the diary of Samuel Pepys"], ''The Daily Mail''&lt;/ref&gt; The diarist [[Samuel Pepys]] observed a [[marionette]] show featuring an early version of the Punch character in [[Covent Garden]] in London. It was performed by Italian puppet showman Pietro Gimonde, a.k.a. "Signor Bologna." Pepys described the event in his diary as "an Italian puppet play, that is within the rails there, which is very pretty."

In the British Punch and Judy show, Punch wears a brightly coloured [[jester]]'s [[motley]] and [[Capotain|sugarloaf hat]] with a tassel. He is a [[hunchback]] whose hooked nose almost meets his curved, jutting chin. He carries a stick (called a slapstick) as large as himself, which he freely uses upon most of the other characters in the show. He speaks in a distinctive squawking voice, produced by a contrivance known as a ''[[swazzle]]'' or ''swatchel'' which the professor holds in his mouth, transmitting his gleeful cackle. This gives Punch a vocal quality as though he were speaking through a [[kazoo]]. So important is Punch's signature sound that it is a matter of some controversy within Punch and Judy circles as to whether a "non-swazzled" show can be considered a true Punch and Judy Show. Other characters do not use the swazzle, so the Punchman has to switch back and forth while still holding the device in his mouth.

In the early 18th century, the marionette theatre starring Punch was at its height, with showman [[Martin Powell (puppetry)|Martin Powell]] attracting sizable crowds at both his ''Punch's Theatre'' at Covent Garden and earlier in provincial [[Bath, Somerset]].&lt;ref name="eb1911-punch"/&gt; Powell has been credited with being "largely responsible for the form taken by the drama of Punch and Judy".&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{DNB|prescript=|wstitle=Powell, Martin|first=Thomas| last=Seccombe|authorlink=Thomas Seccombe|volume=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1721, a puppet theatre opened in [[Dublin]] that ran for decades. The cross-dressing actress [[Charlotte Charke]] ran the successful but short-lived Punch's Theatre in the Old Tennis Court at [[St. James's]], [[Westminster]], presenting adaptations of [[Shakespeare]] as well as plays by herself, her father [[Colley Cibber]], and her friend [[Henry Fielding]]. Fielding eventually ran his own puppet theatre under the pseudonym Madame de la Nash to avoid the censorship concomitant with the Theatre [[Licensing Act of 1737]].

Punch was extremely popular in [[Paris]] and, by the end of the 18th century, he was also playing in Britain's American colonies,&lt;!---By the end of the 18th century, Britain didn't HAVE any American colonies---&gt; where even [[George Washington]] bought tickets for a show. However, marionette productions were expensive and cumbersome to mount and transport, presented in empty halls, the back rooms of [[taverns]], or within large tents at England's yearly agricultural events at [[Bartholomew Fair]] and [[Mayfair]]. In the latter half of the 18th century, marionette companies began to give way to glove-puppet shows, performed from within a narrow, lightweight booth by one puppeteer, usually with an assistant, or "bottler," to gather a crowd and collect money. These shows might travel through country towns or move from corner to corner along busy London streets, giving many performances in a single day. The character of Punch adapted to the new format, going from a stringed comedian who might say outrageous things to a more aggressive glove-puppet who could do outrageous—and often violent—things to the other characters. About this time, Punch's wife's name changed from "Joan" to "Judy."
[[File:Punch and Judy Thornton Hough.jpg|thumb|left|A Punch and Judy show attracts a family audience In [[Thornton Hough]], Merseyside, England]]

The mobile puppet booth of the late 18th- and early 19th-century Punch and Judy [[Hand puppet|glove-puppet]] show was originally covered in checked bed ticking or whatever inexpensive cloth might come to hand. Later Victorian booths were gaudier affairs, particularly those used for Christmas parties and other indoor performances. In the 20th century, however, red-and-white-striped puppet booths became iconic features on the beaches of many English seaside and summer holiday resorts. Such striped cloth is the most common covering today, wherever the show might be performed.

A more substantial change came over time to the show's [[target audience]]. The show was originally intended for adults, but it changed into primarily a children's entertainment in the late Victorian era. Ancient members of the show's cast ceased to be included, such as the [[Devil]] and Punch's mistress "Pretty Polly," when they came to be seen as inappropriate for young audiences.

The story changes, but some phrases remain the same for decades or even centuries. For example, Punch dispatches his foes each in turn and still squeaks his famous catchphrase: "''That's'' the way to do it!"&lt;ref name="350 years" /&gt; The term "pleased as Punch" is derived from Punch and Judy; specifically, Mr. Punch's characteristic sense of gleeful self-satisfaction.

Modern British performances of Punch and Judy are no longer exclusively the traditional [[seaside resort|seaside]] children's entertainments which they had become. They can now be seen at carnivals, festivals, birthday parties, and other celebratory occasions.

==Characters==
[[File:Islington Punch and Judy.JPG|thumb|Punch and Judy, taken in [[Islington]], north London.]]
The characters in a Punch and Judy show are not fixed. They are similar to the cast of a [[soap opera]] or a [[Folklore|folk tale]] such as [[Robin Hood]]: the principal characters must appear, but the lesser characters are included at the discretion of the performer. New characters may be added and older characters dropped as the tradition changes.

Along with Punch and Judy, the cast of characters usually includes their baby, a hungry crocodile, a clown, an officious policeman, and a prop string of sausages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.speckinspace.com/whatsit/history/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123140814/http://www.speckinspace.com/whatsit/history/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 November 2010 |title=A Brief History of Punch and Judy (with an introduction to the characters) |publisher=Speckinspace.com |date= |accessdate=2 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The devil and the generic hangman [[Jack Ketch]] may still make their appearances but, if so, Punch will always get the better of them. The cast of a typical Punch and Judy show today will include:
* Mr. Punch
* Judy
* The Baby
* The Constable
* Joey the Clown
* The Crocodile
* The Skeleton
* The Doctor

Characters once regular but now occasional include:
* Toby the Dog
* The Ghost
* The Lawyer
* Hector the Horse
* Pretty Polly
* The Hangman (a.k.a. Jack Ketch)
* The Devil
* The Beadle
* Jim Crow  ('The black man')
* Mr. Scaramouche
* The Servant (or 'The Minstrel')
* The Blind Man

Other characters included Boxers, Chinese Plate Spinners, topical figures, a trick puppet with an extending neck (the "Courtier"), and a monkey. A live Dog Toby was once a regular featured novelty routine, sitting on the playboard and performing 'with' the puppets.

==Story==
Glyn Edwards has likened the story of Punch and Judy to the story of [[Cinderella]].&lt;ref name="Edwards Glyn Successful"&gt;Edwards, Glyn. (2000) ''Successful Punch and Judy'', Second Edition 2011. Worthing: The Fedora Group. {{ISBN|9780956718914}}. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; He points out that there are parts of the Cinderella story which everyone knows, namely the cruel step sisters, the invitation to the ball, the handsome prince, the fairy godmother, Cinderella's dress turning to rags at midnight, the glass slipper left behind, the prince searching for its owner, and the happy ending. None of these elements can be omitted and the famous story still be told. The same principle applies to Punch and Judy. Everyone knows that Punch mishandles the baby, that Punch and Judy quarrel and fight, that a policeman comes for Punch and gets a taste of his stick, that Punch has a gleeful run-in with a variety of other figures and takes his stick to them all, that eventually he faces his final foe (which might be a hangman, the devil, a crocodile, or a ghost). Edwards contends that a proper Punch and Judy show requires these elements or the audience will feel let down.&lt;ref name="Edwards Glyn Successful" /&gt;

Peter Fraser writes, "the drama developed as a succession of incidents which the audience could join or leave at any time, and much of the show was impromptu."&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Peter (1970) ''Punch and Judy''. London: B.T Batsford. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold Company. {{ISBN|0-7134-2284-X}}. Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 71-110085. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This was elaborated by [[George Speaight]], who explained that the plotline "is like a story compiled in a parlour game of [[Consequences (game)|Consequences]]&amp;nbsp;... the show should, indeed, not be regarded as a story at all but a succession of encounters."&lt;ref&gt;Speaight, George. (1955) ''Punch and Judy: A History'', Revised Edition 1970. London: Studio Vista Ltd. {{ISBN|0-289-79785-3}}. p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Leach makes it clear that "the story is a conceptual entity, not a set text: the means of telling it, therefore, are always variable."&lt;ref&gt;Leach, Robert. (1985) ''The Punch &amp; Judy Show: History, Tradition and Meaning''. London: Batsford Academic and Educational; Athens, Georgia: University of Georgia Press. {{ISBN|0713447842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosalind Crone asserts that the story needed to be episodic so that passersby on the street could easily join or leave the audience during a performance.&lt;ref name="Crone, Rosalind 2006"&gt;Crone, Rosalind (2006). "Mr and Mrs Punch in Nineteenth-Century England." ''The Historical Journal'', 49(4) pp. 1055–1082.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much emphasis is often placed on the first printed script of Punch and Judy, in 1827. It was based on a show by travelling performer Giovanni Piccini, illustrated by [[George Cruikshank]], and written by [[John Payne Collier]]. This is the only surviving script of a performance, and its accuracy is questioned. The performance was stopped frequently to allow Collier and Cruikshank to write and sketch and, in the words of Speaight, Collier is someone of whom "the full list of his forgeries has not yet been reckoned, and the myths he propagated are still being repeated. (His) 'Punch and Judy' is to be warmly welcomed as the first history of puppets in England, but it is also sadly to be examined as the first experiment of a literary criminal."&lt;ref&gt;Speaight (1970), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale of Punch and Judy varies from puppeteer to puppeteer, as previously with Punchinello and Joan, and it has changed over time. Nonetheless, the skeletal outline is often recognizable. It typically involves Punch behaving outrageously, struggling with his wife Judy and the baby, and then triumphing in a series of encounters with the forces of law and order (and often the supernatural), interspersed with jokes and songs.

===Typical 21st-century performance===
A typical show as performed currently in the UK will start with the arrival of Mr. Punch, followed by the introduction of Judy. They may well kiss and dance before Judy requests Mr. Punch to look after the baby. Punch will fail to carry out this task appropriately. It is rare for Punch to hit his baby these days, but he may well sit on it in a failed attempt to "babysit", or drop it, or even let it go through a sausage machine. In any event, Judy will return, will be outraged, will fetch a stick, and the knockabout will commence. A policeman will arrive in response to the mayhem and will himself be felled by Punch's slapstick. All this is carried out at breakneck farcical speed with much involvement from a gleefully shouting audience. From here on anything goes.

Joey the Clown might appear and suggest, "It's dinner time." This will lead to the production of a string of sausages, which Mr. Punch must look after, although the audience will know that this really signals the arrival of a crocodile whom Mr. Punch might not see until the audience shouts out and lets him know. Punch's subsequent comic struggle with the crocodile might then leave him in need of a Doctor who will arrive and attempt to treat Punch by walloping him with a stick until Punch turns the tables on him. Punch may next pause to count his "victims" by laying puppets on the stage, only for Joey the Clown to move them about behind his back in order to frustrate him. A ghost might then appear and give Mr. Punch a fright before it too is chased off with a [[slapstick]].

In less squeamish times, a hangman would arrive to punish Mr. Punch, only to himself be tricked into sticking his head in the noose. "Do you do the hanging?" is a question often asked of performers. Some will include it where circumstances warrant (such as for an adult audience) but most do not. Some will choose to include it whatever the circumstances and will face down any critics. Finally, the show will often end with the Devil arriving for Mr. Punch (and possibly to threaten his audience as well). Punch—in his final gleefully triumphant moment—will win his fight with the Devil, bring the show to a rousing conclusion, and earn a round of applause.

===Plots reflect their own era===

[[File:Hitler Punch and Judy Show.jpg|thumb|A traditional Punch and Judy show dating from [[World War II]] with the addition of a [[Hitler]] Character as a figure of derision to reflect the times. Taken at the [[History On Wheels Museum]], [[Eton Wick]], UK.]]
Punch and Judy might follow no fixed storyline, as with the tales of Robin Hood, but there are episodes common to many recorded versions. It is these set piece encounters or "routines" which are used by performers to construct their own Punch and Judy shows. A visit to a Punch and Judy Festival at Punch's "birthplace" in London's Covent Garden will reveal a whole variety of changes that are wrung by puppeteers from this basic material. Scripts have been published at different times since the early 19th century, but none can be claimed as the definitive traditional script of Punch and Judy. Each printed script reflects the era in which it was performed and the circumstances under which it was printed.

The various episodes of the show are performed in the spirit of outrageous comedy—often provoking shocked laughter—and are dominated by the anarchic clowning of Mr. Punch. Just as the Victorian version of the show drew on the morality of its day, so also the Punch &amp; Judy College of Professors considers that the 20th- and 21st-century versions of the tale have changed into something akin to a primitive version of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', in which a bizarre family is used as a vehicle for grotesque visual comedy and a sideways look at contemporary society.

{{quote|In my opinion the street Punch is one of those extravagant reliefs from the realities of life which would lose its hold upon the people if it were made moral and instructive. I regard it as quite harmless in its influence, and as an outrageous joke which no one in existence would think of regarding as an incentive to any kind of action or as a model for any kind of conduct. It is possible, I think, that one secret source of pleasure very generally derived from this performance… is the satisfaction the spectator feels in the circumstance that likenesses of men and women can be so knocked about, without any pain or suffering.|[[Charles Dickens]]|Letter to Mary Tyler, 6 November 1849, from ''The [[Letters of Charles Dickens]] Vol V, 1847–1849''}}

An awareness of the prevalence of domestic abuse, and how Punch and Judy could be seen to make light of this, threatened Punch and Judy performances in the UK and other English-speaking countries for a time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Puppet show faces knockout punch? |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/502752.stm |accessdate=3 September 2008 |date=8 November 1999 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the show is having one of its cyclical recurrences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.punchandjudyworld.org/wwfbloggem/?itemid=134 |title=around the world with mr. punch » Silly-Season-On-Sea |publisher=Punchandjudyworld.org |date=14 August 2008 |accessdate=2 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223201406/http://www.punchandjudyworld.org/wwfbloggem/?itemid=134 |archivedate=23 February 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can now be seen in [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Ireland]]—and also in [[Canada]], the [[United States]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[Puerto Rico]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[South Africa]]. In 2001, the characters were honoured in the UK with a set of [[Great Britain commemorative stamps 2000–09|British commemorative postage stamps]] issued by the [[Royal Mail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1500372.stm |title="Stamp of Approval for Punch and Judy", BBC News, 20 August 2001 |publisher=BBC News |date=20 August 2001 |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 UK poll, the public voted Punch and Judy onto the list of icons of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New icons of Englishness unveiled|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/4952920.stm|agency=BBC News|issue=27 April 2006|date=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comedy==
Despite Punch’s unapologetic murders throughout the performances, it is still a comedy. The humour is aided by a few things. Rosalind Crone (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;1065) suggests that, since the puppets are carved from wood, their facial expressions cannot change, but are stuck in the same exaggerated pose, which helps to deter any sense of realism and to distance the audience.&lt;ref name="Crone, Rosalind 2006" /&gt; The use of the swazzle also helps to create humour, and that the swazzled sound of Punch's voice takes the cruelty out of Punch.&lt;ref&gt;Proschan, Frank (1981). "Puppet Voices and Interlocutors: Language in Folk Puppetry." ''The Journal of American Folklore'', Vol. 94, No. 374, Folk Drama (Oct.–Dec. 1981), pp.527–555. The American Folklore Society.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Crone, a third aspect that helped make the violence humorous was that Punch's violence toward his wife was prompted by her own violence toward him.&lt;ref name="Crone, Rosalind 2006" /&gt; In this aspect, he retains some of his previous hen-pecked persona. This would suggest that, since Punch was merely acting violently out of self-defence, it was okay. This is a possible explanation for the humour of his violence toward his wife, and even towards others who may have somehow "had it coming."&lt;ref name="Crone, Rosalind 2006" /&gt; This suggestion better explains the humour of the violence toward the baby. Other characters that had to incur the wrath of Punch varied depending on the punchman, but the most common were the foreigner, the blind man, the publican, the constable, and the devil.&lt;ref name="Crone, Rosalind 2006"/&gt;

==Published scripts==
Punch is primarily an oral tradition, adapted by a succession of exponents from live performances rather than authentic scripts, and in constant evolution. There exist, however, some early published scripts of varying authenticity.

In 1828, the critic [[John Payne Collier]] published a Punch and Judy script under the title ''The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Punch and Judy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spyrock.com/nadafarm/html/punch_pdf.html |title=Punch &amp; Judy: 1832 Book pdf file |publisher=Spyrock.com |date= |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script was illustrated by the well-known caricaturist [[George Cruikshank]]. Collier said his script was based on the version performed by the "professor" Giovanni Piccini in the early 19th century, and Piccini himself had begun performing in the streets of London in the late 18th century. The Collier/Cruickshank ''Punch'' has been republished in facsimile several times. Collier's later career as a literary forger has cast some doubt on the authenticity of the script, which is rather literary in style and may well have been tidied up from the rough-and-tumble street-theatre original. 

A transcript of a typical Punch and Judy show in [[London]] of the 1840s can be found in [[Henry Mayhew]]'s ''London Labour and the London Poor''.

[[Image:roberto busa e index thomisticus.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Roberto Busa - 2006 - In the background the Index Thomisticus]]

==Biography==
Born in [[Vicenza]], the second of five children, he attended primary school in [[Bolzano]] and grammar school in [[Verona]] and in [[Belluno]]. In 1928 he entered the Episcopal Seminary of Belluno, completing high school there, and took the first two-year course of Theology with Albino Luciani, the future [[Pope John Paul I]]. In 1933 he joined the [[Society of Jesus]], where he got a diploma in Philosophy in 1937 and one in Theology in 1941 and where he was ordained priest in 1940. From 1940 till 1943 he was an auxiliary army chaplain in the National Army and later in the partisan forces. In 1946 he graduated in Philosophy at the Papal Gregorian University of Rome with a degree thesis entitled "The Thomistic Terminology of Interiority", which was published in 1949. He was full professor of [[Ontology]], [[Theodicy]] and [[Scientific methodology|Scientific Methodology]] and, for some years, a librarian in the "Aloisianum" Faculty of Philosophy of [[Gallarate]].

==The ''Index Thomisticus''==
In 1946 he planned the ''Index Thomisticus'', as a tool for performing text searches within the massive corpus of Aquinas's works. In 1949 he met with [[Thomas J. Watson]], the founder of [[IBM]], and was able to persuade him to sponsor the ''Index Thomisticus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project lasted about 30 years, and eventually produced in the 1970s the 56 printed volumes of the ''Index Thomisticus''. In 1989, a CD-ROM version was produced. In addition, in 2005 a [http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/it/index.age web-based version] made its debut, sponsored by the Fundación Tomás de Aquino and CAEL; the design and programming of this version were carried about by E. Alarcón and E. Bernot, in collaboration with Busa. In 2006 the [http://itreebank.marginalia.it ''Index Thomisticus'' Treebank] project (directed by Marco Passarotti) started the syntactic annotation of the entire corpus.

==The Busa Prize==
The [[Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations]] (ADHO) awards the "Busa Prize", which honors leaders in the field of [[digital humanities|humanities computing]]. The
first Busa Prize was awarded in 1998 to Busa himself. Later winners include:  

* John Burrows (Australia) (presented in 2001, New York, New York, USA)
* [[Susan Hockey]] (UK) (presented in 2004, Gothenburg, Sweden)
* Wilhelm Ott (Germany) (2007, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, USA)
* Joseph Raben (USA) (2010, Kings College London, UK)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8287">The '''Sippewissett Salt Marsh''' is located along the lower eastern [[Buzzards Bay]] shoreline of [[Cape Cod]], about 5 miles north of [[Woods Hole]] and 1 mile southwest of West [[Falmouth, Massachusetts]], in the United States. The marsh has two regions, the Great Sippewisset Marsh to the north and Little Sippewisset Marsh to the south, separated from each other by a narrow tongue of land (Saconesset Hills). The marsh extends into an [[estuary]] in which the [[intertidal zone]] provides a dynamic environment that supports a diverse ecology, including threatened and endangered species such as the roseate tern (''[[Sterna dougallii]]'').&lt;ref name="United State Fish and Wildlife Service"&gt;{{cite journal|last=United States Fish and Wildlife Service|title=Northeast Coastal Areas Study Significant Coastal Habitats (Sippewisset Marshes)|journal=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Conservation Library|url=http://library.fws.gov/pubs5/necas/web_link/35_sippewisset.htm|accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecology of the salt marsh is based in and supported by the [[microbial mats]] which cover the ground of the marsh.

==Description==
[[File:Sippewissett Marsh.png|thumb|The Great Sippewissett Salt Marsh]]
The Sippewissett Salt Marsh houses a diverse, laminated intertidal [[microbial mat]] around 1&amp;nbsp;cm thick. The mat is characterized by regular influx of sea water, high amounts of sulfide and iron, and the production of methane. The mat contains four or five distinctly colored layers. The color of each layer can be attributed to the microbial community composition and the biogeochemical processes they perform at each of the layers. The mats are often coated by green macro- and microalgae that adhere to the surface.&lt;ref name=Teal/&gt; The top, green-brown layer is composed of [[cyanobacteria]] and [[diatom]] species. A blue-green intermediate layer is formed by ''[[Oscillatoria]]'' species. [[Purple sulfur bacteria]] are found in the pink central layer. Below the pink layer, an orange-black layer is formed predominately by a single species of purple sulfur bacteria, ''Thiocapsa pfennigii,'' and [[spirochetes]]. The thin, bottom layer is made up of [[green sulfur bacteria]] belonging to the ''Prosthecochloris'' genus, though this layer is not always present. Below the mat is iron sulfide-rich sediments and remnants of decaying mats.&lt;ref name=nicholson&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0378-1097(87)90021-8 |title=Structure of a microbiol mat at Great Sippewissett Marsh, Cape Cod, Massachusetts |year=1987 |last1=Nicholson |first1=J |journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

===Green layer===
The top 1&amp;nbsp;mm of the green layer is often gold due to the dominant cyanobacteria and diatom species.  Specific cyanobacteria identified are ''[[Lyngbya]]'', a sheeted cyanobacterium, and ''[[Nostoc]]'' and ''Phormidium'', which are filamentous cyanobacteria, and ''Spirulina'' spp. Diatom species identified include ''Navicula''. Below this top gold layer extends 5&amp;nbsp;mm and is dominated by ''[[Lyngbya]]'' and ''[[Oscillatoria]]'' species&lt;ref name=Buckley&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01517.x |title=Vertical distribution of methane metabolism in microbial mats of the Great Sippewissett Salt Marsh |year=2008 |last1=Buckley |first1=Daniel H. |last2=Baumgartner |first2=Laura K. |last3=Visscher |first3=Pieter T. |journal=Environmental Microbiology |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=967–77 |pmid=18218028}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The green layer is also composed of green sulfur bacteria which oxidize sulfur during their growth and are strict photolithotrophs.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Pink layer===
The pink layer extends 3&amp;nbsp;mm below the green layer. The color is due to the presence of carotinoids which are the primary pigments of the phototrophic purple sulfur bacteria.&lt;ref name="Woods Hole"&gt;{{cite web |first=Woods |last=Hole |title=Microbial Diversity Course |url=http://user.uni-frankfurt.de/~schauder/mats/microbial_mats.html |year=1997 |accessdate=17 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128071902/http://user.uni-frankfurt.de/~schauder/mats/microbial_mats.html |archivedate=28 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Amoebobacter, Thiocapsa, Chromatium,'' and ''Thiocystis'' are among the species of purple sulfur bacteria identified.&lt;ref name=nicholson/&gt; Purple sulfur bacteria can use a number of different electron donors for their anaerobic phototrophic growth, including: hydrogen sulfide, sulfur, thiosulfate, and molecular hydrogen.  Their diverse use of many electron donors makes this layer stand out in the microbial mat community.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Black layer===
The bottom layer makes up the lower 2&amp;nbsp;mm of the mat before the depth drops below the [[chemocline]]. The black color is due to the high amounts of iron sulfide generated by the green sulfur-reducing bacteria.&lt;ref name=Buckley/&gt; The layer consists mostly of green sulfur bacteria belonging to the ''Prosthecochloris'' genus, which are a small group of [[prosthecate bacteria]] containing many knobby projections.&lt;ref name=nicholson/&gt; Organisms in this layer decompose organic matter formed by the upper layers, thus recycling the matter.&lt;ref name="Woods Hole"/&gt;

===Gray layer===
The thin, bottommost layer lies below the chemocline and contains fewer organisms than the slightly thicker black layer. The gray color is due to the presence of pyrite. Here, the empty shells of diatoms can be found. Microbial species here are dominated by methylotrophic methanogens which generate the methane observed in the salt marsh. This layer is not active year round; the organisms are largely dormant in the winter.&lt;ref name=Buckley/&gt;

==Metabolism==
The metabolism of the organisms throughout each layer of the microbial mats are tightly coupled to each other and play important roles in providing nutrients for the plants and animals that live in the marsh. The cyanobacteria and diatom algae present in the mat are [[aerobic organism|aerobic]] [[photoautotrophs]] whose energy is derived from the light with oxygen as the [[electron acceptor]] and use hydrogen gas and iron as [[electron donors]].

Purple sulfur bacteria are [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] or [[microaerophilic]] photoautotrophs, and use hydrogen sulfide, sulfur, thiosulfate, and molecular hydrogen as electron donors.

Spirochaetes in the orange-black layer are [[chemoheterotrophic]] and use iron as an electron donor.&lt;ref name=Zaar&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12610722 |year=2003 |last1=Zaar |first1=A |last2=Fuchs |first2=G |last3=Golecki |first3=JR |last4=Overmann |first4=J |title=A new purple sulfur bacterium isolated from a littoral microbial mat, ''Thiorhodococcus drewsii'' sp. nov |volume=179 |issue=3 |pages=174–83 |doi=10.1007/s00203-002-0514-3 |journal=Archives of Microbiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The Sippewissett Salt Marsh has served as a hallmark for studies done on estuarine environments. Scientists at the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]],
the Boston University Marine Program, and the Marine Biological Laboratory have been studying Great Sippewissett Salt Marsh extensively since 1970 to gain a better understanding of microbial diversity and the effects they have on geochemical cycling and nutrient cycling for other organisms.&lt;ref name=Teal&gt;{{cite book |last=Teal |first=J.M. |title=The Ecology of Regularly Flooded Salt Marshes of New England: A Community Profile |series=Biological Reports |year=1986 |volume=85 |issue=7.4 |url=http://library.fws.gov/BiologicalReports/85_7.4.pdf |accessdate=16 May 2012 |oclc=13823654}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sippewissett salt marsh is of particular importance for research, as it is one of the few generally undisturbed salt marshes in New England.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3487">'''Tacpac''' (Touch and Communication Pac) is a sensory communication resource using touch and music to align the [[sense]]s and develop [[communication skills]]. It helps those who have any kind of [[Sensory processing disorder|sensory impairment]] or communication difficulties. It can also help those who have [[tactile defensiveness]], profound and multiple [[Learning impairment|learning difficulties]], [[autism]], [[Down syndrome]], and [[dementia]].

Tacpac uses specially composed music that matches the texture of the object for each activity so that those who are receiving Tacpac have an aligned experience. Over time, users can employ this to help them communicate. 

Tacpac comes in the form of a subscription which is accessed both on the website and also on the app for phones and tablets. The resources include the full music tracks, instruction videos for each activity, and downloadable/printable records that keep sheets and instruction sheets. The app enables users to play full music tracks without an [[internet connection]].

Through repetition of activities in the Tacpac repertoire, a receiver learns to show responses that can be understood: e.g., those manifesting like/dislike; want/rejection; and know/nescient. Users can begin to move in response to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], anticipate activities, and relate to the helper. These primal responses that comprise pre-intentional and [[Affect (psychology)|affectiv]]e communication can be crucial steps toward more clearly defined intentional communication and even [[language acquisition]].

As one researcher writes{{ref|pease}}: "One of the most effective ways of establishing contact with [[Deafblindness|deafblind]] children and so encouraging a communicative response is to share activities with a high levels of [[physical contact]] and pleasant sensations. These include [...] Tacpac, a package where taped music is linked to a range of [[tactile sense|tactile sensations]]."

The number of research projects around Tacpac is growing{{ref|panter}}{{ref|serpa}}{{ref|spevi}}. It has found support from the [[Royal National Institute of Blind People]] in the UK, and has growing followers amongst multi-sensory impairment networks.

'''''The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia''''' is a 1974 [[utopian]] [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], set in the same [[fictional universe]] as that of ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' (the [[Hainish Cycle]]). The book won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1974,&lt;ref name="WWE-1974"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received a nomination for the [[John W. Campbell]] Memorial Award in 1975.&lt;ref name="WWE-1975"/&gt; It achieved a degree of literary recognition unusual for science fiction works due to its exploration of many themes, including anarchism and revolutionary societies, capitalism and individualism and collectivism.

It features the development of the mathematical theory underlying the fictional [[ansible]], an instantaneous communications device that plays a critical role in Le Guin's Hainish Cycle. The invention of the ansible places the novel first in the [[Hainish Cycle#Novels|internal chronology of the Hainish Cycle]], although it was the fifth Hainish novel published.&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[The Word for World is Forest]]'', the newly created ansible is brought to Athshe, a planet being settled by [[Earth]]-[[humans]]. In other tales in the Hainish Cycle, the ansible already exists. The word "ansible" was coined in ''[[Rocannon's World]]'' (first in order of publication but third in internal chronology), where it is central to the plot.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bquote|''The Dispossessed'' started as a very bad short story, which I didn’t try to finish but couldn’t quite let go. There was a book in it, and I knew it, but the book had to wait for me to learn what I was writing about and how to write about it. I needed to understand my own passionate opposition to the war that we were, endlessly it seemed, waging in Vietnam, and endlessly protesting at home. If I had known then that my country would continue making aggressive wars for the rest of my life, I might have had less energy for protesting that one. But, knowing only that [[Down by the Riverside|I didn’t want to study war no more]], I studied peace. I started by reading a whole mess of utopias and learning something about pacifism and [[Gandhi]] and [[nonviolent resistance]]. This led me to the nonviolent anarchist writers such as [[Peter Kropotkin]] and [[Paul Goodman]]. With them I felt a great, immediate affinity. They made sense to me in the way [[Lao Tzu]] did. They enabled me to think about war, peace, politics, how we govern one another and ourselves, the value of failure, and the strength of what is weak.

So, when I realised that nobody had yet written an anarchist utopia, I finally began to see what my book might be. And I found that its principal character, whom I’d first glimpsed in the original misbegotten story, was alive and well—my guide to Anarres. &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.tor.com/2017/08/30/introduction-from-ursula-k-le-guin-the-hainish-novels-stories-volume-one/ “Introduction” from Ursula K. Le Guin: The Hainish Novels &amp; Stories, Volume One], retrieved 9/8/2017 &lt;/ref&gt;}}

Le Guin's parents, academic anthropologists [[Alfred L. Kroeber|Alfred]] and [[Theodora Kroeber]], were friends with [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]; Le Guin stated that Oppenheimer was the model for Shevek, the book's protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spivack|first=Charlotte|title=Ursula K. Le Guin|year=1984|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=Boston|isbn=0805773932}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

==Setting==

''The Dispossessed'' is set on [[Anarres]] and [[Urras (fictional planet)|Urras]], the twin inhabited worlds of [[Tau Ceti in fiction|Tau Ceti]]. Urras is divided into several [[State (polity)|states]] and dominated by its two largest, the rivals A-Io and Thu. The former has a [[capitalism|capitalist]] economy and [[patriarchy|patriarchal system]], and the latter is an authoritarian system that claims to rule in the name of the [[proletariat]]. A-Io has oppositional [[left-wing]] parties, one of which is closely linked to the rival society Thu.

The other world, Anarres, represents a third ideological structure: [[anarcho-syndicalism]]. Its society has weakened influence due to their ancestors' self-imposed exile from Urras. Some citizens of A-Io contact the Anarresti protagonist Shevek, chiding him for betraying his beliefs by working at the university and accepting the government's hospitality.

A revolution sparks in the major, yet undeveloped third area of Benbili. A-Io invades the Thu-supported revolutionary area, generating a [[proxy war]]. Although there are a wide variety of political parties in A-Io, there are none on Anarres.

== Plot summary ==
The chapters alternate between the two planets and in time. The even-numbered chapters, which are set on Anarres, take place first chronologically and are followed by  the odd-numbered chapters, which take place on Urras. The only exceptions occur in the first and last chapters, which take place in both worlds.

In order to forestall an [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] rebellion, the major Urrasti states gave the revolutionaries (inspired by a visionary named Odo) the right to live on Anarres, along with a guarantee of non-interference, approximately two hundred years before the events of ''The Dispossessed''. (The story is told in Le Guin's "[[The Day Before the Revolution]]".)  Before this, Anarres had had no permanent settlements, apart from some mining facilities.

The economic and political situation of Anarres and its relation to Urras is ambiguous. The people of Anarres consider themselves as being free and independent, having broken off from the political and social influence of the old world. However, the powers of Urras consider Anarres as being essentially their mining colony, as the annual consignment of Anarres' [[precious metals]] and their distribution to major powers on Urras is a major economic event of the old world.

===Anarres (chapters 1,2,4,6,8,10,12,13)===
Chapter One begins in the middle of the story. The protagonist Shevek is a physicist attempting to develop a General Temporal Theory. The physics of the book describes time as having a much deeper, more complex structure than we understand it. It incorporates not only mathematics and physics, but also philosophy and ethics. Shevek finds his work blocked by a jealous superior, as his theories conflict with the prevailing political philosophy and are thus distrusted by the society. His work is further disrupted by his obligation to perform manual labor during a drought in this anarchist society; in order to ensure survival in a harsh environment, the people of Anarres must put the needs of  society ahead of their own personal desires, so Shevek performs hard agricultural labor in a dusty desert instead of working on his research. He arranges to go to Urras to finish and publish his theory.

===Urras (chapters 1,3,5,7,9,11,13)===
Arriving on Urras, Shevek is feted. Shevek soon finds himself disgusted with the social, sexual and political conventions of the hierarchical capitalist society of Urras. He joins in a labor protest that is violently suppressed, but he escapes to safety. Finally, he is sponsored by ambassadors of Terra who provide him safe passage back to Anarres.

==Themes==

=== Symbolism ===
The ambiguity of Anarres' economic and political situation in relation to Urras is symbolically manifested in the low wall surrounding Anarres' single spaceport. This wall is the only place on the [[anarchist]] planet where "No Trespassing!" signs may be seen, and it is where the book begins and ends. The people of Anarres believe that the wall divides a free world from the corrupting influence of an oppressor's ships. On the other hand, the wall could be a prison wall keeping the rest of the planet imprisoned and cut off. Shevek's life attempts to answer this question.

In addition to Shevek's journey to answer questions about his society's true level of freedom, the meaning of his theories themselves weave their way into the plot; they not only describe abstract physical concepts, but they also reflect ups and downs of the characters' lives, and the transformation of the Anarresti society. An oft-quoted saying in the book is "true journey is return."&lt;ref&gt;Said by Shevek near the end of Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of Shevek's theories—which deal with the nature of time and simultaneity—have been subject to interpretation. For example, there have been interpretations that the non-linear nature of the novel is a reproduction of Shevek's theory.&lt;ref&gt;Rigsby, Ellen M. (2005), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anarchism and capitalism ===
Le Guin's foreword to the novel notes that her anarchism is closely akin to that of [[Peter Kropotkin]], whose ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution|Mutual Aid]]'' closely assessed the influence of the natural world on competition and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Kropotkin]], ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution|Mutual Aid]]'' (1902).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many conflicts occur between the freedom of anarchism and the constraints imposed by authority and society, both on Anarres and Urras. These constraints are both physical and social. Physically, Odo was imprisoned in the Fort for nine years. Socially speaking, 'time after time the question of who is being locked out or in, which side of the wall one is on, is the focus of the narrative.' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/7/barbour7art.htm|title=Wholeness and Balance|last=Barbour|first=Douglas|publisher=Science Fiction Studies (1975)|accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Tunik emphasises that ''the wall'' is the dominant metaphor for these social constraints. Shevek hits ‘the wall of charm, courtesy, indifference.” He later notes that he let a “wall be built around him” that kept him from seeing the poor people on Urras. He had been co-opted, with walls of smiles of the rich, and he didn’t know how to break them down. Shevek at one point speculates that the people on Urras are not truly free, precisely because they have so many walls built between people and are so possessive. He says, “You are all in jail. Each alone, solitary, with a heap of what he owns. You live in prison, die in prison. It is all I can see in your eyes – the wall, the wall!” ‘ &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/7017991/The_New_Utopian_Politics_of_Ursula_K._Le_Guins_The_Dispossessed|title=The Need for Walls: Privacy, Community, and Freedom in The Dispossessed|last=Tunik|first=Mark|publisher=Lexington Books (2005)|accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not just the state of mind of those inside the prisons that concerns Shevek, he also notes the effect on those outside the walls. Steve Grossi says, ‘by building a physical wall to keep the bad in, we construct a mental wall keeping ourselves, our thoughts, and our empathy out, to the collective detriment of all." Shevek himself later says, “those who build walls are their own prisoners.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevegrossi.com/on/the-dispossessed|title=The Dispossessed|last=Grossi|first=Steve|publisher=Steve Grossi (2013)|accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Le Guin makes this explicit in chapter two, when the schoolchildren construct their own prison and detain one of their own inside. The deleterious effect on the children outside parallels the effect on the guards in the [[Stanford Prison Experiment]] of 1971 (three years before ''The Dispossessed'' was published).&lt;ref name="paul_brians2"&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/science_fiction/dispossessed.html "Study Guide for Ursula LeGuin: '''The Dispossessed''' (1974)" - Paul Brians] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107225601/http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/science_fiction/dispossessed.html |date=2005-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://doukhobor666.wordpress.com/2015/12/20/the-dispossessed/|title=The Dispossessed|publisher=Samizdat (2015)|accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language spoken on Anarres also reflects anarchism. [[Pravic]] is a [[constructed language]] in the tradition of [[Esperanto]]. Pravic reflects many aspects of the philosophical foundations of utopian anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence, Davis and Peter G. Stillman. ''The New Utopian Politics of Ursula K. Le Guin's The Dispossessed'', Lexington Books (2005). Pp. 287-298.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the use of the [[possessive case]] is strongly discouraged, a feature that also is reflected by the novel's title.&lt;ref&gt;Conley, Tim and Stephen Cain. ''Encyclopedia of Fictional and Fantastic Languages''. Greenwood Press, Westport (2006). Pp. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Children are trained to speak only about matters that interest others; anything else is "egoizing" (pp.&amp;nbsp;28–31). There is no property ownership of any kind. Shevek's daughter, upon meeting him for the first time, tells him, "You can share the handkerchief I use"&lt;ref name="Dispossessed2"&gt;Ursula K. Le Guin, ''The Dispossessed'', p.69.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than "You may borrow my handkerchief", thus conveying the idea that the handkerchief is not owned by the girl, but is merely used by her.&lt;ref name="Burton-19852"&gt;Burton (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Utopianism ===
The work is sometimes said to represent one of the few modern revivals of the [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|utopian genre]].&lt;ref name="Davis-20052"&gt;Davis and Stillman (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; When first published, the book included the tagline: "The magnificent epic of an ambiguous utopia!" which was shortened by fans to "An ambiguous utopia" and adopted as a subtitle in certain editions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://io9.gizmodo.com/5607981/ursula-le-guins-the-dispossessed-when-you-want-to-like-a-book-but-dont Book review discussing meanings]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20719930?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Penn State University Press listing]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many characteristics of a utopian novel found in this book. For example, Shevek is an outsider when he arrives on Urras, which capitalizes on the utopian and scientific fiction theme of the "estrangement-setting".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/7/bierman7art.htm|title=Judah Bierman- Ambiguity in Utopia: The Dispossessed|website=www.depauw.edu|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Guin's utopianism, however, differs from the traditional "anarchist commune." Whereas most utopian novels attempt to convey a society that is absolutely good, this world differs as it is portrayed only as "ambiguously good."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Feminism ===
There is some disagreement as to whether ''The Dispossessed'' should be considered a [[Feminism|feminist]] utopia or a [[feminist science fiction]] novel. According to Mary Morrison of the State University of New York at Buffalo, the anarchist themes in this book help to promote feminist themes as well. Other critics, such as William Marcellino of SUNY Buffalo and Sarah Lefanu, writer of "Popular Writing and Feminist Intervention in Science Fiction," argue that there are distinct anti-feminist undertones throughout the novel.

Morrison argues that Le Guin's portrayed ideals of [[Taoism]], the celebration of labor and the body, and desire or sexual freedom in an anarchist society contribute greatly to the book's feminist message. Taoism, which rejects dualisms and divisions in favor of a [[Yin and Yang]] balance, brings attention to the balance between not only the two planets, but between the male and female inhabitants. The celebration of labor on Anarres stems from a celebration of a mother's labor, focusing on creating life rather than on building objects. The sexual freedom on Anarres also contributes to the book's feminist message.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Mary I. Anarcho-Feminism and Permanent Revolution in Ursula K. Le Guin's ‘‘The Dispossessed’’, State University of New York at Buffalo, Ann Arbor, 2011, ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses A&amp;I; ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Global, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search.proquest.com/docview/878894517&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some critics believe that Le Guin's feminist themes are either weak or not present. Some believe that the Taoist interdependence between the genders actually weakens Le Guin's feminist message. Marcellino believes that the anarchist themes in the novel take precedence and dwarf any feminist themes.&lt;ref&gt;Marcellino, William. "Shadows to Walk: Ursula Le Guin's Transgressions in Utopia." The Journal of American Culture, vol. 32, no. 3, 2009, pp. 203-213, Music Periodicals Database; Performing Arts Periodicals Database, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search.proquest.com/docview/200658410&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Lefanu adds that there is a difference between the feminist messages that the book explicitly presents and the anti-feminist undertones. For example, the book says that women created the society on Anarres. However, female characters seem secondary to the male protagonist, who seems to be a traditional male hero; this subversion weakens any feminist message that Le Guin was trying to convey.&lt;ref&gt;Lefanu, Sarah. "Popular Writing and Feminist Intervention in Science Fiction." Gender, Genre and Narrative Pleasure. Ed. Derek Longhurst. Vol. 9. New York: Routledge, 2012. 177-92. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title==
It has been suggested that Le Guin's title is a reference to [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoyevsky's]] novel about anarchists, ''[[Demons (Dostoyevsky novel)|Demons]]'' ({{lang-ru|Бесы}}, ''Bésy''), one popular English-language translation of which is titled ''The Possessed''.&lt;ref name="paul_brians2"/&gt; Much of the philosophical underpinnings and ecological concepts came from [[Murray Bookchin]]'s ''[[Post-Scarcity Anarchism]]'' (1971), according to a letter Le Guin sent to Bookchin.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Biehl, Bookchin biographer; letter in UKL archive&lt;/ref&gt; Anarres citizens are ''dispossessed'' not just by political choice, but by the very lack of actual resources to possess. Here, again, Le Guin draws a contrast with the natural wealth of Urras, and the competitive behaviors this fosters.&lt;ref&gt;Mathiesen.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposed time ==
In the last chapter of ''The Dispossessed'', we learn that the Hainish people arrived at Tau Ceti 60 years previously, which is more than 150 years after the secession of the Odonians from Urras and their exodus to Anarres. [[Terra (Hainish cycle)|Terrans]] are also there, and the novel occurs some time in the future, according to an elaborate chronology worked out by science fiction author [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]] in 1975: "the baseline date of AD 2300 for The Dispossessed is taken from the description of Earth in that book (§11) as having passed through an ecological and social collapse with a population peak of 9 billion to a low-population but highly centralized recovery economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Ian |last= Watson | title= Le Guin's ''Lathe of Heaven'' and the Role of Dick: The False Reality as Mediator| publisher= Science Fiction Studies # 5 = Volume 2, Part 1 | date=March 1975 | accessdate=2017-02-26 |url= http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/5/watson5art.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same article, Watson assigns a date of  AD 4870 to [[The Left Hand of Darkness]]; both dates are problematic — as Watson says himself, they are contradicted by "Genly Ai's statement that Terrans 'were ignorant until about three thousand years ago of the uses of zero' ".

==Reception==
The novel received generally positive reviews. [[Baird Searles]] characterized the novel as an "extraordinary work", saying Le Guin had "created a working society in exquisite detail" and "a fully realized hypothetical culture [as well as] living breathing characters who are inevitable products of that culture".&lt;ref&gt;"The Dispossessed: Visit from A Small Planet", ''[[Village Voice]]'', November 21, 1974, pp.56, 58&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald Jonas, writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', said that "Le Guin's book, written in her solid, no-nonsense prose, is so persuasive that it ought to put a stop to the writing of prescriptive Utopias for at least 10 years".&lt;ref&gt;"Of Things to Come", ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', October 26, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodore Sturgeon]] praised ''The Dispossessed'' as "a beautifully written, beautifully composed book", saying "it performs one of [science fiction's] prime functions, which is to create another kind of social system to see how it would work. Or if it would work."&lt;ref&gt;

"Galaxy Bookshelf", ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'', June 1974, pp.97-98&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lester del Rey]], however, gave the novel a mixed review, citing the quality of Le Guin's writing but claiming that the ending "slips badly", a ''[[deus ex machina]]'' that "destroy[s] much of the strength of the novel".&lt;ref&gt;"Reading Room", [[If (magazine)|''If'']], August 1974, pp.144-45&lt;/ref&gt;

The College of Behavioral and Social Sciences began as "The School of Liberal Arts" in 1919, and was headquartered in [[Morrill Hall (University of Maryland)|Morrill Hall]]; Frederic E. Lee served as the school's first dean. In the 1920s, it became "The College of Arts and Sciences," with five separate divisions. In 1936, the college moved into the newly completed College of Arts and Sciences Building, which was renamed Francis Scott Key Hall in 1955. In the 1940s, the departments of Economics, Geography and Government &amp; Politics moved into The College of Business and Public Administration.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsos.umd.edu/about-us/history.aspx |title=College of Behavioral and Social Sciences - History |publisher=Bsos.umd.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Business and Public Administration combined to become the new "Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences", one of five divisions in the university. In 1986, the five divisions split into fourteen colleges, and The College of Behavioral and Social Sciences was formed. The college has been headquartered in Millard E. Tydings Hall since 1993.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Undergraduate opportunities==

===CIVICUS===
{{Original research|section|date=December 2013}}CIVICUS is a two-year living and learning undergraduate program in the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences, which links academic coursework together with participation in internships and community service to provide an experience of civil service engagement for participants (known as CIVICUS Associates). CIVICUS Associates live together in Somerset Hall (located in the North Hill Community), which was renovated in 1999 for the CIVICUS Living and Learning Program. Somerset Hall also houses the program's offices and hosts CIVICUS classes. The hall is designed with several study and social lounges to enhance students' living and learning experience. Somerset is located centrally on campus making the walk to classes, the dining hall, McKeldin Library, and the Stamp Student Union quick and convenient. All the rooms in Somerset are air conditioned and each student has his/her own internet, phone, and cable jack. Most of the rooms are doubles with a few triples and quads scattered throughout the building. There are also some singles. In addition, there is a computer lab and laundry facility located on the ground floor. Each floor also has one or two small kitchenettes with a microwave and a sink.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.civicus.umd.edu/somerset.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

For students entering CIVICUS in the fall of their freshman year, the CIVICUS classes students are required to take in their first semester consist of a 1-credit class called CIVICUS Student and the University (BSCV181) and a 3-credit class called Introduction to CIVICUS (BSCV191). In their second semester, students take a 1-credit class called CIVICUS and Service Learning (BSCV182) and a 3 credit class called Introduction to Contemporary Social Problems (SOCY105). In their third semester in the CIVICUS program, students take a 3-credit class called Leadership in a Multicultural Society. In the last semester in the program students take the CIVICUS Capstone 3 credit class (BSCV302) that gives them academic credit for their CIVICUS Internship. A student can take a 1 credit class instead if the student is getting academic credit from another academic program.  The creator and current director of the program is Dr. Sue Briggs, who teaches the majority of the required courses, as well as provides assistance and information regarding all aspects of the program.

In addition to the in-class requirements, CIVICUS associates are responsible for completing four service projects per semester, a long term service project, and an internship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civicus.umd.edu/somerset.htm CIVIUS Website, Somerset Hall] Retrieved 2010-7-8&lt;/ref&gt; Associates also participate in an additional two community days of service, once per semester. Students are able to participate in wide variety of service activities, ranging from those on campus, to those in the surrounding counties and Washington, D.C. The program is based on the five principles of civil society: citizenship, leadership, community building in a diverse society, scholarship, and community service-learning. CIVICUS is a program for enthusiastic, motivated, and dedicated students who want to get involved with the campus and local community to make a positive difference. CIVICUS comprises a diverse group of student leaders whose distinct personalities, perspectives, and backgrounds enrich class discussions, service projects, and the conversations throughout the halls of Somerset. This camaraderie continues even after CIVICUS students have completed their citation, as many CIVICUS juniors and seniors return regularly to Somerset and remain involved with the program. In addition to being involved with the CIVICUS community, many of the students are actively involved in the university and local communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.civicus.umd.edu/associates.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

University of Maryland freshmen applicants whose application materials suggest they possess significant levels of leadership, involvement, and motivation are invited to join the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civicus.umd.edu/faq.htm#1 CIVICUS Website, FAQ] Retrieved 2010-7-8&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 130 associates are in the program at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:International Association for World Englishes.jpg|thumb|380px|alt=International Association for World Englishes|International Association for World Englishes]]

'''World Englishes''' is a term for emerging localized or [[Indigenous language|indigenized]] varieties of English, especially varieties that have developed in territories influenced by the United Kingdom or the United States. The study of World Englishes consists of identifying varieties of English used in diverse sociolinguistic contexts globally and analyzing how sociolinguistic histories, multicultural backgrounds and contexts of function influence the use of English in different regions of the world.

The issue of World Englishes was first raised in 1978 to examine concepts of regional Englishes globally. Pragmatic factors such as appropriateness, comprehensibility and interpretability justified the use of English as an international and intra-national language. In 1988, at a [[TESOL Inc.|Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL)]] conference in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], the International Committee of the Study of World Englishes (ICWE) was formed. In 1992, the ICWE formally launched the International Association for World Englishes (IAWE) at a conference of "World Englishes Today", at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago|University of Illinois]], USA.&lt;ref name="web"&gt;International Association of World Englishes [http://www.iaweworks.org/history.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214100854/http://www.iaweworks.org/history.php# |date=2010-12-14 }}, Retrieved on 18 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There is now an academic journal devoted to the study of this topic, titled ''World Englishes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1467971x|title=World Englishes - Wiley Online Library|website=onlinelibrary.wiley.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there are approximately 75 territories where English is spoken either as a [[first language]] (L1) or as an unofficial or institutionalized [[second language]] (L2) in fields such as government, law and education. It is difficult to establish the total number of Englishes in the world, as new varieties of English are constantly being developed and discovered.&lt;ref name="Crystal"&gt;Crystal, D. (2007). ''English as a Global Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==World English vs. World Englishes vs. Global Englishes==
The notions of [[International English|World English]] and World Englishes are far from similar, although the terms are often mistakenly {{Citation needed|reason=How does one know this isn't just some arbitrary distinction just on Wikipedia?|date=December 2014}} used interchangeably. ''World English'' refers to the English language as a [[lingua franca]] used in business, trade, diplomacy and other spheres of global activity, while ''World Englishes'' refers to the different varieties of English and [[English-based creole languages|English-based creoles]] developed in different regions of the world. Alternatively, the term ''Global Englishes'' has been used by scholars in the field to emphasise the more recent spread of English due to [[globalization]], which has resulted in increased usage of [[English as a lingua franca]].&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, N. &amp; Rose, H. (2015). ''Introducing Global Englishes.'' Arbingdon, UK: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paradowski|first=Michał B.|title=Barbara Seidlhofer: Understanding English as a Lingua Franca: A Complete Introduction to the Theoretical Nature and Practical Implications of English used as a Lingua Franca (Review article)|url=https://www.academia.edu/3318842|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==

===History of English===
{{Main|History of the English language}}

'''English''' is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] that originated from the [[Anglo-Frisian]] [[dialect]]s brought by [[Germanic tribes|Germanic invaders]] into [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Initially, [[Old English]] was a diverse group of dialects, reflecting the varied origins of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdoms of England. Eventually, one of these dialects, [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|Late West Saxon]], came to dominate.&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;Baugh, A. C. and Cable. T. (1993). ''A History of the English Language''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original [[Old English language]] was then influenced by two further waves of invasion: the first by speakers of the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian branch]] of the Germanic language family, who conquered and colonized parts of Britain in the 8th and 9th centuries; the second by the [[Norman conquest of England|Normans in the 11th century]], who spoke [[Old Norman]] and ultimately developed a Norman variety called [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]. For two centuries after the Norman Conquest, [[French language|French]] became the language of everyday life among the upper classes in England. Although the language of the masses remained English, the [[bilingual]] character of England in this period was thus formed.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

During the [[Middle English]] period, France and England experienced a process of separation. This period of conflicting interests and feelings of resentment was later termed the [[Hundred Years' War]]. By the beginning of the 14th century, English had regained universal use and become the principal tongue of all England, but not without having undergone significant change.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], patriotic feelings regarding English brought about the recognition of English as the national language of England. The language was advocated as acceptable for learned and literary use. With the [[Great Vowel Shift]], the language in this period matured to a standard and differed significantly from the [[Middle English]] period, becoming recognizably "[[Early Modern English|modern]]".&lt;ref&gt;Stockwell, R. (2002). "How much shifting actually occurred in the historical English vowel shift?", Minkova, Donka; Stockwell, Robert. ''Studies in the History of the English Language: A Millennial Perspective''. Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Modern English|18th century]], three main forces were driving the direction of the English language: (1) to reduce the language to rule and effect a standard of correct usage; (2) to refine the language by removing supposed defects and introducing certain improvements; and (3) to fix English permanently in the desired form. This desire for system and regularity in the language contrasted with the individualism and spirit of independence characterized by the previous age.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

By the 19th century, the expansion of the [[British Empire]], as well as global trade, had led to the spread of English around the world. The rising importance of some of England's larger colonies and former colonies, such as the rapidly developing United States, enhanced the value of the English varieties spoken in these regions, encouraging the belief, among the local populations, that their distinct varieties of English should be granted equal standing with the standard of [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

===Global spread of English===
;The First dispersal: English is transported to the 'new world'
The first [[diaspora]] involved relatively large-scale [[Human migration|migrations]] of mother-tongue English speakers from [[England]], Scotland and Ireland predominantly to [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean]], Australia, [[South Africa]] and New Zealand. Over time, their own English dialects developed into modern American, Canadian, West Indian, South African, Australian, and [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]] Englishes. In contrast to the [[British English|English of Great Britain]], the varieties spoken in modern North America and Caribbean, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand have been modified in response to the changed and changing sociolinguistic contexts of the migrants, for example being in contact with indigenous [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], [[Khoisan]] and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]], [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] or [[Māori people|Maori]] populations in the colonies.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins"&gt;[[Jenkins, Jennifer]]. (2003). ''World Englishes: A Resource Book for Students.'' London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

;The Second dispersal: English is transported to Asia and Africa
The second [[diaspora]] was the result of the colonization of Asia and Africa, which led to the development of '[[New Englishes]]', the second-language varieties of English. In [[colonial Africa]], the history of English is distinct between West and East Africa. English in [[West Africa]] began with trade. particularly the [[slave trade]]. English soon gained official status in what are today [[Gambia]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]], and some of the [[pidgin]] and [[creole language|creoles]] which developed from English contact, including [[Krio language|Krio]] (Sierra Leone) and [[Cameroon Pidgin]], have large numbers of speakers now.

As for [[East Africa]], extensive British settlements were established in what are now [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Malawi]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], where English became a crucial language of the government, education and the law. From the early 1960s, the six countries achieved independence in succession; but English remained the official language and had large numbers of second language speakers in Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi (along with [[Chewa language|Chewa]]).

English was formally introduced to the sub-continent of [[South Asia]] (India, [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]]) during the second half of the eighteenth century. In India, English was given status through the implementation of Macaulay 'Minute' of 1835, which proposed the introduction of an English educational system in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frances Pritchett |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/txt_minute_education_1835.html |title=Minute on Education (1835) by Thomas Babington Macaulay |publisher=Columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the process of '[[Indianisation (British India)|Indianisation]]' led to the development of a distinctive national character of English in the Indian sub-continent.

British influence in [[South-East Asia]] and the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] began in the late eighteenth century, involving primarily the territories now known as [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Hong Kong]]. [[Papua New Guinea]], also a [[British protectorate]], exemplified the English-based [[pidgin]] - [[Tok Pisin]].

The Americans came late in [[South-East Asia]] but their influence spread like wildfire as their reforms on education in the [[Philippines]] progressed in their less than half a century colonization of the islands. English has been taught since the American period and is one of the official languages of the Philippines. Ever since English became the official language, a localized variety gradually emerged - [[Philippine English]]. Lately, linguist Wilkinson Daniel Wong Gonzales &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wilkinson_Daniel_Wong_Gonzales?ev=hdr_xprf&amp;_sg=mCNszti2YtJXBcgvTb_FFtSXL3-s4zdYcFDgMf1MYf5IPlslU5e-unjgtlDoLAPc|title=Wilkinson Daniel Wong Gonzales {{!}} Master of Arts, English Language and Linguistics {{!}} National University of Singapore, Singapore {{!}} NUS {{!}} Department of English Language &amp; Literature {{!}} ResearchGate|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that this variety has in itself more varieties, suggesting that we move towards [[Philippine Englishes]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307896694|title=a to A��o Social Salesiana em rede... {{!}} Browse publications|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; paradigm to progress further in Schneider's dynamic model after gathering evidences of such happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Villanueva|first=Rey John Castro|title=The Features of Philippine English across Regions|date=2016|url=http://lynchlibrary.pssc.org.ph/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=2750&amp;shelfbrowse_itemnumber=6284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, English is also learnt in other countries in neighbouring areas, most notably in [[Taiwan]], Japan and [[Korea]], with the latter two having begun to consider the possibility of making English their official second language.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt;

==Classification of Englishes==
The spread of English around the world is often discussed in terms of three distinct groups of users, where English is used respectively as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Jennifer|title=World englishes : a resource book for studens|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-25806-7|pages=14–15|edition=1. edition, 3. reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# a [[native language]] (ENL); the [[primary language]] of the majority population of a country, such as in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia.
# a [[second language]] (ESL); an additional language for ''intra''national as well as ''inter''national communication in communities that are [[multilingual]], such as in India, [[Nigeria]], and [[Singapore]]. Most of these Englishes developed as a result of imperial expansion that brought the language to various parts of the world.
# a [[foreign language]] (EFL); used almost exclusively for international communication, such as in Japan.

===Kachru's Three Circles of English===
[[File:Kachru's three circles of English.jpg|thumb|alt=Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English|Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English''.]] The most influential model of the spread of English is [[Braj Kachru]]'s model of World Englishes. In this model the diffusion of English is captured in terms of three Concentric Circles of the language: The Inner Circle, the Outer Circle, and the Expanding Circle.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. (1992). ''The Other Tongue: English across cultures''. University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Inner Circle''''' refers to English as it originally took shape and was spread across the world in the first [[diaspora]]. In this transplantation of English, speakers from England carried the language to Australia, New Zealand and North America. The Inner Circle thus represents the traditional historical and sociolinguistic bases of English in regions where it is now used as a primary language: the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, anglophone Canada and [[South Africa]], and some of the [[Caribbean]] territories. English is the [[native language]] or [[mother tongue]] of most people in these countries. The total number of English speakers in the inner circle is as high as 380 million, of whom some 120 million are outside the United States.

The '''''Outer Circle''''' of English was produced by the second [[diaspora]] of English, which spread the language through imperial expansion by [[Great Britain]] in [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. In these regions, English is not the native tongue, but serves as a useful [[lingua franca]] between [[ethnic]] and language groups. Higher education, the [[legislature]] and [[judiciary]], national commerce and so on may all be carried out predominantly in English. This circle includes [[India]], [[Nigeria]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Malaysia]], [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], non-Anglophone [[South Africa]], the [[Philippines]] (colonized by the US) and others. The total number of English speakers in the outer circle is estimated to range from 150 million to 300 million.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, Y. (2006). ''World Englishes in Asian Contexts''. (Larry E. Smith Eds.) Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Singapore]], while in the Outer Circle, may be drifting into the Inner Circle as English becomes more often used as a home language (see [[Languages of Singapore]]), much as Ireland did earlier. Countries where most people speak an [[English-based creole]] and retain standard English for official purposes, such as [[Jamaica]] and [[Papua New Guinea]], are also in the Outer Circle.

Finally, the '''''Expanding Circle''''' encompasses countries where English plays no historical or governmental role, but where it is nevertheless widely used as a medium of international communication. This includes much of the rest of the world's population not categorized above, including territories such as China, Russia, Japan, non-Anglophone [[Europe]] (especially the [[Netherlands]] and [[Nordic countries]]), [[South Korea]], [[Egypt]] and [[Indonesia]]. The total in this expanding circle is the most difficult to estimate, especially because English may be employed for specific, limited purposes, usually in a business context. The estimates of these users range from 100 million to one billion.

The inner circle (UK, US etc.) is 'norm-providing'; that means that English language [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] are developed in these countries. The outer circle (mainly [[Commonwealth countries|New Commonwealth countries]]) is 'norm-developing'. The expanding circle (which includes much of the rest of the world) is 'norm-dependent', because it relies on the standards set by [[native speakers]] in the inner circle.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. (1992). World Englishes: approaches, issues and resources. ''Language Teaching'', 25: 1-14. Cambridge UP''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schneider's Dynamic Model of Postcolonial Englishes===
{{Main|Schneider's Dynamic Model}}
Edgar Werner Schneider tries to avoid a purely geographical and historical approach evident in the 'circles' models and incorporates [[sociolinguistic|sociolinguistic concepts]] pertaining to acts of [[Identity (social science)|identity]].&lt;ref name="y2"&gt;Le Page, R. B. and Tabouret-Keller, A. (1985). ''Acts of identity: Creole-based approaches to language and ethnicity''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
He outlines five characteristic stages in the spread of English:

'''''Phase 1 - Foundation''''': This is the initial stage of the introduction of English to a new territory over an extended period of time. Two linguistic processes are operative at this stage: (a) [[language contact]] between English and [[indigenous language]]s; (b) contact between different [[dialects of English]] of the settlers which eventually results in a new stable [[dialect]] (see [[Koiné language|koiné]]). At this stage, [[bilingualism]] is marginal. A few members of the local populace may play an important role as interpreters, translators and guides. Borrowings are limited to lexical items; with local place names and terms for local fauna and flora being adopted by the English.&lt;ref name="y5"&gt;Schneider, E. W. (2007). ''Postcolonial English: Varieties around the world''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phase 2 - Exonormative stabilization''''': At this stage, the settler communities tend to stabilize politically under British rule. English increases in prominence and though the [[colloquial]] English is a colonial [[Koiné language|koiné]], the speakers look to England for their formal norms. Local vocabulary continues to be adopted. Bilingualism increases amongst the [[indigenous population]] through education and increased contacts with English settlers. Knowledge of English becomes an asset, and a new indigenous [[elite]] develops.&lt;ref name="y5" /&gt;

'''''Phase 3 - Nativisation''''': According to Schneider, this is the stage at which a transition occurs as the English settler population starts to accept a new [[identity (social science)|identity]] based on present and local realities, rather than sole allegiance to their 'mother country'. By this time, the indigenous strand has also stabilized an [[Second language|L2]] system that is a synthesis of substrate effects, interlanguage processes and features adopted from the settlers' [[Koiné language|koiné]] English. [[Neologisms]] stabilize as English is made to adapt to local sociopolitical and cultural practices.&lt;ref name="y5" /&gt;

'''''Phase 4 - Endonormative stabilization''''': This stage is characterized by the gradual acceptance of local [[Norms (sociology)|norms]], supported by a new locally rooted linguistic self-confidence. By this time political events have made it clear that the settler and indigenous strands are inextricably bound in a sense of [[nation]]hood independent of Britain. Acceptance of local English(es) expresses this new [[identity (social science)|identity]]. National dictionaries are enthusiastically supported, at least for new [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] (and not always for localized grammar). [[Literary genre|Literary creativity]] in local English begins to flourish.&lt;ref name="y1"&gt;Mesthrie, Rajend and Bhatt, Rakesh M. (2008). ''World Englishes: The Study of New Linguistic Varieties''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phase 5 - Differentiation''''': At this stage there is a change in the dynamics of [[identity (social science)|identity]] as the young nation sees itself as less defined by its differences from the [[British Empire|former colonial power]] as a composite of subgroups defined on regional, social and ethnic lines. Coupled with the simple effects of time in effecting [[language change]] (with the aid of [[social differentiation]]) the new English [[Koiné language|koiné]] starts to show greater differentiation.&lt;ref name="y1" /&gt;

===Other models of classification===
====Strevens's world map of English====
The oldest map of the spread of English is Strevens's world map of English.  His world map, even predating that of Kachru's three circles, showed that since American English became a separate variety from British English, all subsequent Englishes have had affinities with either one or the other.&lt;ref name="y3"&gt;Strevens, P. (1980). ''Teaching English as an International Language''. Oxford: Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====McArthur's circle of World English====
McArthur's "wheel model" has an idealized central variety called "World Standard English," which is best represented by "written international English." The next circle is made of regional standards or standards that are emerging. Finally, the outer layer consists of localized varieties which may have similarities with the regional standards or emerging standards.

Although the model is neat, it raises several problems. Firstly, the three different types of English&amp;nbsp;— ENL, [[ESL]] and [[English as a foreign or second language|EFL]], are conflated in the second circle. Secondly, the multitude of Englishes in Europe are also missing in this layer. Finally, the outside layer includes [[pidgins]], [[creole language|creoles]] and [[Second language|L2]] Englishes. Most scholars would argue that [[Pidgin English|English pidgins]] and [[English creoles|creoles]] do not belong to one family: rather they have overlapping multiple memberships.&lt;ref&gt;McArthur, A. (1987). "The English Languages?" ''English Today'': 11:9-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Görlach's circle model of English====
Manfred Görlach's and McArthur's models are reasonably similar. Both exclude English varieties in Europe. As Görlach does not include [[English as a foreign or second language|EFL]]s at all, his model is more consistent, though less comprehensive. Outside the circle are mixed varieties ([[pidgins]], [[creole language|creoles]] and mixed languages involving English), which are better categorized as having partial membership.&lt;ref&gt;Görlach, M. (1990).''Studies in the History of the English Language''. Heidelberg: Carl Winter.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modiano's model of English====
In Modiano's model of English, the center consists of users of English as an International Language, with a core set of features which are comprehensible to the majority of native and competent [[non-native speakers]] of English. The second circle consists of features which may become internationally common or may fall into obscurity. Finally, the outer area consists of five groups ([[American English]], [[British English]], other major varieties, local varieties, foreign varieties) each with features peculiar to their own speech community and which are unlikely to be understood by most members of the other four groups.&lt;ref&gt;Modiano, M. (1999). "Standard English(es) and educational practices for the world's lingua franca". ''English Today'': 15/4: 3-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations and varieties==
 {{main|List of dialects of the English language}}

The World Englishes paradigm is not static, and neither are rapidly changing realities of language use worldwide. The use of English in the Outer and Expanding Circle societies (refer to '''Kachru's Three Circles of English''') continues its rapid spread, while at the same time new patterns of [[language contact]] and variety differentiation emerge. The different varieties range from English in the Inner circle societies such as the United States, Canada, [[South Africa]], Australia and New Zealand, to the Outer circle post-colonial societies of [[Asia]] and [[Africa]].
The World Englishes initiative, in recognizing and describing the New Englishes of the [[Caribbean English|Caribbean]], [[African English|Africa]] and [[Asia]], has been partly motivated by a consideration of the local linguistic factors and partly by a consideration of the wider [[cultural]] and [[political]] contexts of [[language acquisition]] and use. This, in turn, has involved the creative rewriting of discourses towards a recognition of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]] and multiple possibilities for scholarship. The notion of varieties in this context is similarly dynamic, as new contexts, new realities, new discourses, and new varieties continue to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. B., Kachru, Y. and Nelson, C. (2009). ''The Handbook of World Englishes''. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''[[language]]'' and ''[[dialect]]'' are not easily defined concepts. It is often suggested that languages are [[Autonomous language|autonomous]], while dialects are [[Heteronomous language|heteronomous]]. It is also said that dialects, in contrast with languages, are mutually intelligible, though this is not always the case. Dialects are characteristically spoken, do not have a codified form and are used only in certain domains.&lt;ref name ="Melchers"&gt;Melchers, G. and Shaw, P. (2003) World Englishes. ''The English Language Series''. Department of English, Stockholm University, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to avoid the difficult dialect-language distinction, linguists tend to prefer a more neutral term, ''variety'', which covers both concepts and is not clouded by popular usage. This term is generally used when discussing World Englishes.

==The future of World Englishes==
Two scenarios have been advanced about English's future status as the major [[world language]]: it  will ultimately fragment into a large number of [[mutually unintelligible]] varieties (in effect, [[languages]]), or it will converge so that differences across groups of speakers are largely eliminated.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;

===English as the language of 'others'===
If English is, numerically speaking, the language of 'others', then the center of gravity of the language is almost certain to shift in the direction of the 'others'. In the words of [[Henry Widdowson|Widdowson]], there is likely to be a paradigm shift from one of language distribution to one of language spread:&lt;ref&gt;Widdowson, H. G. (1997). "EIL, ESL, EFL: Global Issues and Local Interests". ''World Englishes'', 16: 135–146.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|When we talk about the spread of English, then, it is not that the conventionally coded forms and meanings are transmitted into different environments and different surroundings, and taken up and used by different groups of people. It is not a matter of the actual language being distributed but of the virtual language being spread and in the process being variously actualized. The distribution of the actual language implies adoption and conformity. The spread of virtual language implies adaptation and nonconformity. The two processes are quite different.}}

In this new paradigm, English spreads and adapts according to the linguistic and cultural preferences of its users in the Outer and Expanding circles (refer to Kachru's Three Circles of English). However, if English is genuinely to become the language of 'others', then the 'others' have to be accorded&amp;nbsp;– or perhaps more likely, accord themselves&amp;nbsp;– at least the same English language rights as those claimed by mother-tongue speakers.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paradowski, M.B. 2008, Apr. Winds of change in the English language&amp;nbsp;– Air of peril for native speakers? Novitas-ROYAL (Research on Youth and Language) 2(1), 92–119. http://www.novitasroyal.org/paradowski.pdf However, it remains to be seen whether such a [[paradigm shift]] will take place.&lt;/ref&gt;

===A different world language===
The other potential shift in the linguistic center of gravity is that English could lose its [[International English|international role]] altogether, or come to share it with a number of equals. Although this would not happen mainly as a result of native-speaker resistance to the spread of non-native speaker Englishes and the consequent abandoning of English by large numbers of non-native speakers, the latter could play a part.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;

As evidence that English may eventually give way to another language (or languages) as the world's [[lingua franca]], [[David Crystal]] cites [[Internet]] data:&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, D. (2001) Language and the Internet. Cambridge UP.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|When the internet started it was of course 100 percent English because of where it came from, but since the 1980s that status has started to fall away. By 1995, it was down to about 80 per cent present of English on the internet, and the current figures for 2001 are that it is hovering somewhere between 60 percent and 70 percent, with a significant drop likely over the next four or five years.}}
On the other hand, there are at least 1500 languages present on the internet now and that figure is likely to increase.  Nevertheless, Crystal predicts that English will retain its dominant presence.

The '''World Ocean Conference 2009''' ('''WOC''') is an international conference to develop a common understanding and firm commitment to address the adverse impact of [[climate change]] on the state of the world’s [[ocean]]s, and increase understanding on the role of the oceans as ‘climate moderator’. This conference includes diplomats and heads of state from a number of countries.  It took place in May 2009 in [[Manado]], [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Ocean Conference 2009 Digelar di Manado |url=http://edukasi.kompas.com/read/2008/11/27/17355392/world.ocean.conference.2009.digelar.di.manado |publisher=[[Kompas]]|accessdate=6 July 2017|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its topic is the threat to various nations from rising oceans due to [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Ocean Conference Bulletin|url=http://enb.iisd.org/oceans/woc2009/html/ymbvol162num5e.html |publisher=[[International Institute for Sustainable Development]]|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference was scheduled to be held from 11 - 14 May, included hundreds of officials and experts from over 74 countries.&lt;ref name="development_bank_1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Asian Development Bank|2009|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is seen as a prelude to talks in December 2009 regarding a successor agreement to the [[Kyoto Protocol]].&lt;ref name="nations_23"&gt;{{Harvnb|United Nations|2009|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The 1982 [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS), as the instrument that sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out, the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) and its Kyoto Protocol, the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD), and the [[Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter]], 1972, and its 1996 Protocol.&lt;ref name="nations_23"&gt;{{Harvnb|United Nations|2009|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982|url=http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_overview_convention.htm |publisher=[[United Nations]]|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognises that oceans and coasts provide valuable resources and services to support human populations, particularly coastal communities that heavily depend on them. Sustainable use of marine living resources will enhance global [[food security]] and reduce poverty for present and future generations. The declaration will be put forward to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UN FCCC]] and hopefully adopted at the [[Copenhagen Accord|COP 15]] in [[Copenhagen]] at the end of the year.&lt;ref name="mangroves"&gt;{{cite news|title=World Ocean Conference|url=https://www.mangrovesforthefuture.org/news-and-media/events/indonesia/2009/world-ocean-conference/ |publisher=Mangroves for the Future|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mod"&gt;{{cite news|title=Manado Ocean Declaration Adopted at World Ocean Conference - Ocean States Eye Copenhagen|url=http://www.cep.unep.org/news-and-events/manado-ocean-declaration-adopted-at-world-ocean-conference-ocean-states-eye-copenhagen|publisher=Caribbean Environment Programme|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Realizing the detrimental effects and importance of climate change, The WOC  agreed to discuss the commitments on how to increase the role ocean in reducing the impact of climate change. The WOC have three main interests of states:&lt;ref name="world bank"/&gt;
* SIDS - very concern on [[sea-level rise]] (Indonesia is the largest archipelagical country in the world). Climate change is particularly threatening to Indonesia as sea level rise would adversely affect many Indonesia's low lying coastal areas.&lt;ref name="vaughn_19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughn|2010|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tropical developing states - on adaptation measures, food security, and livelihood
* Developed states - observing the possibility that the ocean could function as "Carbon Sink"

==Objectives==
The main purpose of the WOC 2009 is to adoption of [[Manado Ocean Declaration]] (MOD).&lt;ref name="mod"/&gt; The declaration consists of 14 core opening paragraphs and 21 points of operative agreement. The contents of the declaration include the commitment to long-term conservation, management, and sustainable use of marine living resources, establish national strategies to sustainably manage marine and coastal ecosystems and enhance their resilience, reduce land- and sea-based pollution, and also to increase understanding and information exchange on coasts, oceans and climate change, particularly in developing countries.&lt;ref name="world bank"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deklarasi Kelautan Manado Disepakati 75 Negara|url=http://sains.kompas.com/read/2009/05/14/18203851/Deklarasai.Kelautan.Manado.Disepakati.75.Negara|publisher=[[Kompas]]|accessdate=6 July 2017|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite criticism the MOD was not strong enough to push the international community to help developing nations deal with the impacts of climate change, Indonesian Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Minister [[Freddy Numberi]], chairman of the conference, said the WOC had put oceans center stage in world attention and raised awareness of the importance of oceans in climate change. But representatives from both developed and developing countries expressed satisfaction with the results.&lt;ref name="mod"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FINAL Press Release: Laporan Capaian Panitia Penyelenggara WOC 2009 dan CTI Summit serta Langkah Menuju ke COP-15 UNFCCC Kopenhagen|url=http://beritamanado.com/final-press-release-laporan-capaian-panitia-penyelenggara-woc-2009-dan-cti-summit-serta-langkah-menuju-ke-cop-15-unfccc-kopenhagen/|publisher=PT BMCOM|accessdate=6 July 2017|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
