The APEX Business-IT Global Case Challenge is an annual event held in May which typically lasts for 4 or 5 days. Each year, the competition features a unique, “live” case which highlights genuine challenges that businesses face. Participating teams compete in a 24-hour deliberation to develop and present integrated solutions that use [[IT]] to address these challenges and meet business needs.&lt;ref name="SMU hosts inaugural international business-IT competition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apex.smu.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SMU-hosts-inaugural-intl-business-IT-competition.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023054924/http://apex.smu.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SMU-hosts-inaugural-intl-business-IT-competition.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 October 2014 |title=SMU hosts inaugural international business-IT competition |last=Zhang |first=Y |publisher=The Business Times |date=4 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the competition, participants also partake in a topical workshop held by industry experts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8256">An '''allele-specific oligonucleotide''' ('''ASO''') is a short piece of synthetic [[DNA]] complementary to the sequence of a variable target DNA. It acts as a [[Hybridization probe|probe]] for the presence of the target in a [[Southern blot]] assay or, more commonly, in the simpler [[Dot blot]] assay. It is a common tool used in [[genetic testing]], [[forensics]], and [[Molecular Biology]] research.

An ASO is typically an [[oligonucleotide]] of 15–21 [[nucleotide|nucleotide bases]] in length. It is designed (and used) in a way that makes it specific for only one version, or [[allele]], of the DNA being tested. The length of the ASO, which strand it is chosen from, and the conditions by which it is [[Nucleic acid hybridization|bound to]] (and washed from) the target DNA all play a role in its specificity. These probes can usually be designed to detect a difference of as little as 1 base in the target's genetic sequence, a basic ability in the assay of [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs), important in [[genotype|genotype analysis]] and the [[Human Genome Project]]. To be detected after it has bound to its target, the ASO must be labeled with a radioactive, enzymatic, or fluorescent tag. The [[Illumina Methylation Assay]] technology takes advantage of ASO to detect one base pair difference (cytosine versus thymine) to measure methylation at a specific CpG site.

==Example==
[[File:Allele-specific oligonucleotide (sample).jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Binding of the "S" ASO probe to "S" DNA (top) or "A" DNA (bottom).&lt;/center&gt;]]
The human disease [[sickle-cell disease|sickle cell anemia]] is caused by a genetic [[mutation]] in the [[codon]] for the sixth [[amino acid]] of the blood protein [[HBB|beta-hemoglobin]]. The normal DNA sequence G-A-G codes for the amino acid [[glutamate]], while the mutation changes the middle [[adenine]] to a [[thymine]], leading to the sequence G-T-G (G-U-G in the [[messenger RNA|mRNA]]). This altered sequence substitutes a [[valine]] into the final protein, distorting its structure.

To test for the presence of the mutation in a DNA sample, an ASO probe would be synthesized to be complementary to the altered sequence,&lt;ref name="Studencki"&gt;Studencki AB, Conner BJ, Impraim CC, Teplitz RL, and Wallace RB "Discrimination among the human beta A, beta S, and beta C-globin genes using allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization probes." Am J Hum Genet vol. 37(1), pp. 42–51 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; here labeled as "S". As a control, another ASO would be synthesized for the normal sequence "A". Each ASO is fully complementary to its target sequence (and will bind strongly), but has a single mismatch against its non-target allele (leading to weaker interaction). The first diagram shows how the "S" probe is fully complementary to the "S" target (top), but is partially mismatched against the "A" target (bottom).

[[image:DotBlotDemo.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Schematic of dot-blots using the "A" or "S" ASO probes.&lt;/center&gt;]]
A segment of the beta-hemoglobin genes in the sample DNA(s) would be amplified by PCR, and the resulting products applied to duplicate support membranes as [[Dot blot]]s. The sample's DNA strands are separated with alkali, and each ASO probe is applied to a different blot. After hybridization, a washing protocol is used which can discriminate between the fully complementary and the mismatched hybrids. The mismatched ASOs are washed off of the blots, while the matched ASOs (and their labels) remain.

In the second diagram, six samples of amplified DNA have been applied to each of the two blots. [[Autoradiography|Detection]] of the ASO label that remains after washing allows a direct reading of the [[genotype]] of the samples, each with two copies of the beta-hemoglobin gene. Samples 1 and 4 only have the normal "A" allele, while samples 3 and 5 have both the "A" and "S" alleles (and are therefore [[Zygosity#Heterozygous|heterozygous]] [[Genetic carrier|carriers]] of this [[Dominance relationship#Recessive allele|recessive mutation]]). Samples 2 and 6 have only the "S" allele, and would be affected by the disease. The small amount of 'cross hybridization' shown is typical, and is considered in the process of interpreting the final results.

==Alternatives==
ASO analysis is only one of the methods used to detect genetic polymorphisms. Direct [[DNA sequencing]] is used to initially characterize the mutation, but is too laborious for routine screening. An earlier method, [[Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism]] (RFLP) didn't need to know the sequence change beforehand, but required that the mutation affect the cleavage site of a [[Restriction Enzyme]]. The RFLP assay was briefly adapted to the use of oligonucleotide [[Oligomer restriction|probes]],&lt;ref name="Saiki1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/ebind2html/pcr/034 |title=Enzymatic amplification of beta-globin genomic sequences and restriction site analysis for diagnosis of sickle cell anemia |last=Saiki |first=RK |author2=Scharf S |author3=Faloona F |author4=Mullis KB |author5=Horn GT |author6=Erlich HA |author7=Arnheim N |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=20 Dec 1985 |volume=230 |issue=4732 |pages=1350–4 |doi=10.1126/science.2999980 |pmid=2999980 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this technique was quickly supplanted by ASO analysis of [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) amplified DNA. The PCR technique itself has been adapted to detect polymorphisms, as [[Variants of PCR|allele-specific PCR]]. However, the simplicity and versatility of the combined PCR/ASO method has led to its continued use, including with non-radioactive labels, and in a "reverse dot blot" format where the ASO probes are bound to the membrane and the amplified sample DNA is used for [[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridization]].

==History==
The use of synthetic oligonucleotides as specific probes for genetic sequence variations was pioneered by R. Bruce Wallace, working at the [[City of Hope National Medical Center]] in [[Duarte, California]]. In 1979 Wallace and his coworkers reported the use of ASO probes to detect variations in a single-stranded bacterial virus,&lt;ref&gt;Wallace RB, Shaffer J, Murphy RF, Bonner J, Hirose T, and Itakura K "Hybridization of synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides to Phi-X 174 DNA: the effect of single base pair mismatch." Nucleic Acids Research, vol. 6(11), pp. 3543–3558 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; and later applied the technique to cloned human genes. In 1983&lt;ref&gt;Conner BJ, Reyes AA, Morin C, Itakura K, Teplitz RL, and Wallace RB "Detection of sickle cell beta S-globin allele by hybridization with synthetic oligonucleotides." Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. vol. 80(1), pp. 278–282 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; and 1985&lt;ref name="Studencki"/&gt; Wallace's lab reported the detection of the mutation for [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle cell anemia]] in samples of whole genomic DNA, although this application was hampered by the small amount of label that could be carried by the ASO.&lt;ref name="Studencki"/&gt;

Fortunately PCR, a method to greatly amplify a specific segment of DNA, was also reported in 1985.&lt;ref name="Saiki1"/&gt; In less than a year PCR had been paired with ASO analysis.&lt;ref name="Saiki2"&gt;Saiki RK, Bugawan TL, Horn GT, Mullis KB, and Erlich HE "Analysis of enzymatically amplified beta-globin and HLA-DQ DNA with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes" Nature vol. 324(6093) pp. 163–166 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; This combination solved the problem of ASO labeling, since the amount of target DNA could be amplified over a million-fold. Also, the specificity of the PCR process itself could be added to that of the ASO probes, greatly reducing the problem of spurious binding of the ASO to non-target sequences. The combination was specific enough that it could be used in a simple [[Dot blot]], avoiding the laborious and inefficient [[Southern blot]] method.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23320">{{Anti-consumerism}}

'''Anti-consumerism''' is a [[sociopolitical]] [[ideology]] that is opposed to [[consumerism]], the continual buying and consuming of material possessions.  Anti-consumerism is concerned with the private actions of business corporations in pursuit of financial and economic goals at the expense of the public welfare, especially in matters of [[environmental protection]], [[social stratification]], and [[ethics]] in the governing of a society. In politics, anti-consumerism overlaps with [[environmental activism]], [[anti-globalization]], and [[animal-rights]] activism; moreover, a conceptual variation of anti-consumerism is ''[[post-consumerism]]'', living in a material way that transcends consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postconsumers.com |title=Postconsumers |publisher=Postconsumers |date=2018-06-13 |accessdate=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-consumerism arose in response to the problems caused by the long-term mistreatment of human consumers and of the animals consumed, and from the incorporation of [[consumer education]] to school [[curriculum|curricula]]; examples of anti-consumerism are the book ''[[No Logo]]'' (2000) by [[Naomi Klein]], and documentary films such as ''[[The Corporation (2003 film)|The Corporation]]'' (2003), by [[Mark Achbar]] and [[Jennifer Abbott]], and ''[[Surplus (film)|Surplus: Terrorized into Being Consumers]]'' (2003), by [[Erik Gandini]]; each made [[anti-corporate activism]] popular as an ideologically accessible form of civil and political action.

The criticism of [[economic materialism]] as a dehumanizing behaviour that is destructive of the Earth, as [[biosphere|human habitat]], comes from [[religion]] and [[social activism]]. The religious criticism asserts that materialist consumerism interferes with the connection between the individual and God, and so is an inherently [[immoral]] style of life; thus the German historian [[Oswald Spengler]] (1880–1936) said that "Life in America is exclusively economic in structure, and lacks depth."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Stearns, Peter. ''Consumerism in World History''. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; From the Roman Catholic perspective, [[Thomas Aquinas]] said that "Greed is a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things"; in that vein, [[Francis of Assisi]], [[Ammon Hennacy]], and [[Mohandas Gandhi]] said that spiritual inspiration guided them towards [[simple living]].

From the secular perspective, social activism indicates that from consumerist materialism derive [[crime]] (which originates from the [[poverty]] of [[economic inequality]]), industrial [[pollution]] and the consequent [[environmental degradation]], and [[war]] as a business. About the societal discontent born of [[malaise]] and [[hedonism]], [[Pope Benedict XVI]] said that the philosophy of materialism offers no ''[[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]]'' for human existence;&lt;ref&gt;Web log. 17 July 2008. http://babs22.wordpress.com/2008/07/17/australia-pope-attacks-consumerism/&lt;/ref&gt; likewise, the writer [[Georges Duhamel]] said that "American materialism [is] a beacon of mediocrity that threatened to eclipse French civilization".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Background==
Anti-consumerism originated from criticism of consumption, starting with [[Thorstein Veblen]], who, in the book ''[[Theory of the Leisure Class|The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions]]'' (1899), indicated that [[consumerism]] dates from the [[cradle of civilization]]. The term ''consumerism'' also denotes economic policies associated with [[Keynesian economics]], and the belief that the free choice of consumers should dictate the economic structure of a society (cf. [[producerism]]).

==Politics and society==
[[File:Anticonsumismo.JPG|thumb|250px|An anti-consumerist [[stencil graffiti]] saying "Consuming consumes you"]]
Many [[anti-corporate activist]]s believe the rise of large-business corporations poses a threat to the legitimate authority of [[nation states]] and the public sphere.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} They feel corporations are invading people's [[privacy]], manipulating politics and governments, and creating false needs in consumers.  They state evidence such as invasive advertising [[adware]], [[spam (electronic)|spam]], [[telemarketing]], child-targeted advertising, aggressive [[guerrilla marketing]], massive corporate campaign contributions in political elections, interference in the policies of sovereign nation states ([[Ken Saro-Wiwa]]), and news stories about [[corporate corruption]] ([[Enron]], for example).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Anti-consumerism protesters point out that the main responsibility of a corporation is to answer only to [[shareholders]], giving [[human rights]] and other issues almost no consideration.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The management does have a primary responsibility to their shareholders, since any [[philanthropic]] activities that do not directly serve the business could be deemed to be a [[Position of trust|breach of trust]].  This sort of financial responsibility means that multi-national corporations will pursue strategies to intensify labor and reduce costs. For example, they will attempt to find low wage economies with laws which are conveniently lenient on human rights, the [[natural environment]], [[trade union]] organization and so on (see, for example, [[Nike, Inc.#Human rights concerns|Nike]]).

An important contribution to the critique of consumerism has been made by French philosopher [[Bernard Stiegler]], arguing modern capitalism is governed by consumption rather than production, and the advertising techniques used to create [[consumer behaviour]] amount to the destruction of psychic and collective [[individuation]].  The diversion of libidinal energy toward the consumption of consumer products, he argues, results in an addictive cycle of consumption, leading to hyper consumption, the exhaustion of desire, and the reign of symbolic misery.

In art, [[Banksy]], influential British graffiti master, painter, activist, filmmaker and all-purpose provocateur&lt;ref name="Kakutani"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/books/banksy-the-man-behind-the-wall-by-will-ellsworth-jones.html|title=‘Banksy: The Man Behind the Wall,’ by Will Ellsworth-Jones|last=Kakutani|first=Michiko|date=2013-02-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; has made statements in public works about the consumerist society. Working undercover, the secretive street artist challenges social ideas and goads viewers into rethinking their surroundings, to acknowledge the absurdities of closely held preconceptions.&lt;ref name="Kakutani"/&gt; Quote from Banksy: “You owe the companies nothing. Less than nothing, you especially don’t owe them any courtesy. They owe you. They have re-arranged the world to put themselves in front of you. They never asked for your permission, don’t even start asking for theirs.” After 2003, Banksy wrote the ''New Yorker'' by e-mail: “I give away thousands of paintings for free. I don’t think it’s possible to make art about world poverty and trouser all the cash.” Banksy believes that there is a consumerist shift in art, and for the first time, the bourgeois world of art belongs to the people. On his [http://www.banksy.co.uk/menu.asp website], he provides high-resolution images of his work for free downloading.

===Conspicuous consumption===

In many critical contexts,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} the term describes the tendency of people to identify strongly with products or services they consume, especially with commercial [[brand]] names and obvious [[status symbol|status-enhancing]] appeal, such as a brand of expensive automobiles or [[jewelry]]. It is a pejorative term which most people deny, having some more specific excuse or [[rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]] for consumption other than the idea that they are "compelled to consume". A culture that has a high amount of consumerism is referred to as a [[consumer culture]].

To those who embrace the idea of consumerism, these products are not seen as valuable in themselves, but rather as social signals that allow them to identify like-minded people through consumption and display of similar products. Few would yet go so far, though, as to admit that their relationships with a product or brand name could be substitutes for healthy human relationships that sometimes lack in a dysfunctional modern [[society]].

The older term ''conspicuous consumption'' described the [[United States]] in the 1960s, but was soon linked to larger debates about [[media influence]], [[culture jamming]], and its corollary [[productivism]]. 
[[File:BarsStencil.jpg|thumb|Anti-consumerist [[stencil]] art]]
The term and concept of ''conspicuous consumption'' originated at the turn of the 20th century in the writing of economist [[Thorstein Veblen]]. The term describes an apparently irrational and confounding form of economic behaviour. Veblen's scathing proposal that this unnecessary consumption is a form of status display is made in darkly humorous observations like the following:
{{quote |It is true of dress in even a higher degree than of most other items of consumption, that people will undergo a very considerable degree of privation in the comforts or the necessaries of life in order to afford what is considered a decent amount of wasteful consumption; so that it is by no means an uncommon occurrence, in an inclement climate, for people to go ill clad in order to appear well dressed.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]], 1899&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1955, economist [[Victor Lebow]] stated (as quoted by [[William E. Rees (academic)|William Rees]], 2009):
{{quote |Our enormously productive economy demands that we make consumption our way of life, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek our spiritual satisfaction and our ego satisfaction in consumption. We need things consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.}}

According to archaeologists, evidence of conspicuous consumption up to several millennia ago has been found, suggesting that such behavior is inherent to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Consumerism and advertising===
Anti-consumerists believe [[advertising]] plays a huge role in human life by informing values and assumptions of the cultural system, deeming what is acceptable and determining social standards.&lt;ref name="World. Dir 1997"&gt;[ Advertising and the End of the World. Dir. Sut Jhally. Perf. [[Sut Jhally]]. DVD. Media Education Foundation, 1997.]&lt;/ref&gt;  They declare that ads create a hyper-real world where commodities appear as the key to securing happiness.  Anti-consumerists cite studies that find that individuals believe their quality of life improves in relation to social values that lie outside the capability of the market place.  Therefore, advertising attempts to equate the social with the material by utilizing images and slogans to link commodities with the real sources of human happiness, such as meaningful relationships.  Ads are then a detriment to society because they tell consumers that accumulating more and more possessions will bring them closer to self-actualization, or the concept of a complete and secure being.  "The underlying message is that owning these products will enhance our image and ensure our popularity with others".&lt;ref&gt;[Tim Kasser, "The High Price of Materialism", 2002, p.9, Achorn Graphic Services]&lt;/ref&gt; And while advertising promises that a product will make the consumer happy, advertising simultaneously depends upon the consumer never being ''truly'' happy, as then the consumer would no longer feel the need to consume needless products.

Anti-consumerists claim that in a consumerist society, advertisement images disempower and objectify the consumer.&lt;ref name="Rumbo"&gt;Joseph D. Rumbo, "Consumer Resistance in a World of Advertising Clutter: The Case of Adbusters", Psychology and Marketing, Vol.19(2), February 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  By stressing individual power, choice and desire, advertising falsely implies the control lies with the consumer.  Because anti-consumerists believe commodities only supply short-term gratification, they detract from a sustainably happy society.  Further, advertisers have resorted to new techniques of capturing attention, such as the increased speed of ads and [[product placement]]s.&lt;ref name="World. Dir 1997"/&gt;  In this way, commercials infiltrate the consumerist society and become an inextricable part of culture.  Anti-consumerists condemn advertising because it constructs a simulated world that offers fantastical [[escapism]] to consumers, rather than reflecting actual reality.  They further argue that ads depict the interests and lifestyles of the elite as natural; cultivating a deep sense of inadequacy among viewers.&lt;ref name="Rumbo" /&gt;  They denounce use of beautiful models because they glamorize the commodity beyond reach of the average individual.

In an opinion segment of ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine published in August 2009, reporter Andy Coghlan cited [[William E. Rees (academic)|William Rees]] of the [[University of British Columbia]] and [[Epidemiology|epidemiologist]] [[Warren Hern]] of the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], saying that human beings, despite considering themselves civilized thinkers, are "subconsciously still driven by an impulse for survival, domination and expansion... an impulse which now finds expression in the idea that inexorable economic growth is the answer to everything, and, given time, will redress all the world's existing inequalities." According to figures presented by Rees at the annual meeting of the [[Ecological Society of America]], human society is in a "global overshoot", consuming 30% more material than is sustainable from the world's resources. Rees went on to state that at present, 85 countries are exceeding their domestic "bio-capacities", and compensate for their lack of local material by depleting the stocks of other countries.

===Alternatives to mainstream economic concepts===
{{confusing|section|date=August 2013}}
Throughout the ages, various movements have tried to model alternatives to consumerism while remaining in the capitalist society. [[Intentional community|Intentional communities]] provide an example of this, as do monastic orders, barter movements and technology-driving sharing or exchange mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ic.org/directory/bruderhof/|title=Bruderhof - Fellowship for Intentional Community|work=Fellowship for Intentional Community|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, an intentional community called the Bruderhof has a system of sharing within the community, and no money is used by the members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/bruderhof-christians-beliefs-set/2015/05/07/id/643320/|title=5 Beliefs That Set the Bruderhof Apart From Other Christians|work=Newsmax|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bruderhof runs a successful manufacturing business that allows it to trade in the capitalistic society, but without the members indulging in consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communityplaythings.com/about-us/history|title=communityplaythings.com - Our History|website=www.communityplaythings.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such anti-consumerist, anti-capitalist notions are not without their detractors. New thought and theory has spurred movements to alter world economic climate. Green movements and some other thinkers are opposed to the focus put on economics. The need for terminology has created familiar ideas such as [[carrying-capacity]], and [[ecological footprint]].

[[David Ricardo]], an early economist, had ideas that state the finitude of growth, rather than the opposite; his ideas were similar to those of [[Mark Twain]], when he said "Buy land, they don't make it anymore." To Ricardian logic, land was a limiting factor.

==Austrian economics==

Some{{who|date=December 2017}} adherents to the Austrian economic philosophy advocate against consumerism due to its effect of contributing to "debt slavery." Austrian economic advocates focus on the entrepreneur, promoting a productive lifestyle rather than a materialistic one wherein the individual is defined by things and not himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/consumerism-defense|title=Consumerism: A Defense - Tibor R. Machan|first=|last=kanopiadmin|date=27 October 2000|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Many{{who|date=October 2015}} have accused anti-consumerists of opposing [[modernity]] or [[utilitarianism]]. Right-wing critics see anti-consumerism as rooted in socialism. In 1999, the [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] magazine [[Reason (magazine)|''Reason'']] attacked anti-consumerism, claiming [[marxism|Marxist]] academics are repackaging themselves as anti-consumerists. [[James B. Twitchell]], a professor at the [[University of Florida]] and popular writer, referred to anti-consumerist arguments as "Marxism Lite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Twitchell |first1=James B. |title=In Praise of Consumerism |date=August 2000 |website=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/27795.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been socialist critics of anti-consumerism who see it as a form of anti-modern "reactionary socialism", and state that anti-consumerism has also been adopted by ultra-conservatives and [[fascism|fascists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Varul |first1=Matthias Zick |title=Towards a consumerist critique of capitalism: A socialist defence of consumer culture |journal=Ephemera: Theory &amp; Politics in Organization |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=293–315 |date=May 2013 |url=http://www.ephemerajournal.org/contribution/towards-consumerist-critique-capitalism-socialist-defence-consumer-culture |issn=1473-2866 |isbn=9781906948177 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular media==
In [[Fight Club]], the protagonist, finds himself participating in terroristic acts against corporate society and consumer culture.

In [[Mr. Robot]], Elliot Anderson, a young cybersecurity engineer, joins a hacker group known as fsociety, which aims to crash the U.S. economy, eliminating all debt.

In the novel [[American Psycho]] by [[Bret Easton Ellis]], the protagonist Patrick Bateman criticizes the consumerist society of America in the 1980s of which he is a personification. Later on he goes on a killing spree  without any consequences, suggesting that the people around him are so self-absorbed and focused on consuming that they either don't see or don't care about his acts.

'''Ant–fungus mutualism''' is a [[symbiosis]] seen in certain [[ant]] and [[fungus|fungal]] species, in which ants actively cultivate fungus much like humans farm [[agriculture|crop]]s as a food source. In some species, the ants and fungi are dependent on each other for survival. The [[leafcutter ant]] is a well-known example of this symbiosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Types==
There are five main types of agriculture that fungus-growing ants practice:&lt;ref name="Mehdiabdi and Schultz 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mehdiabadi, N. J.  |author2=T. R. Schultz|year=2009|title=Natural history and phylogeny of the fungus-farming ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Myrmicinae: Attini)|journal=Myrmecological News|volume=13|pages=37–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; lower, [[coral fungi]], [[yeast]], generalized higher, and leafcutter agricultural systems.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Schultz and Brady 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Yeast agriculture is practiced by 18 species of ''[[Cyphomyrmex]] rimosus''. The ''C. rimosus'' group is hypothesized to have evolved growing fungus in a yeast form between 5 and 25 million years ago.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Generalized higher agriculture is practiced by 63 species in two genera and refers to the condition of highly domesticated fungus.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The fungi used in higher agriculture cannot survive without its agriculturalists to tend it and has phenotypic changes that allow for increased ease of ant harvesting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Leafcutter agriculture, which is a more highly derived form of higher agriculture, is practiced by 40 species in two genera and has the most recent evolution, originating between 8 and 12 million years ago.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Leaf cutters use living biomass as the substrate to feed their fungi, whereas in all other types of agriculture, the fungus requires dead biomass.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==The attines==
The ants of the [[Attini]] tribe (subfamily Myrmicinae) are obligatory fungicultivists. Attini form twelve genera with over 200 species, which for the most part cultivate [[Lepiotaceae]] fungi of the tribe [[Leucocoprineae]].&lt;ref name=Mueller2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=chapela /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weber N. A. 1972. Gardening ants: The attines. Philadelphia (PA): American Philosophical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;
These ants are typically subdivided into the "lower" and "higher" attines. One of the more distinguishing factors between these two subgroups is their respective cultivars and cultivar substrates. Lower attines have less specialized cultivars that more closely resemble ''Leucocoprineae'' found in the wild and use "ancestral substrates" composed of plant, wood, arthropod, and flower detritus. The higher attines, on the other hand, use freshly cut grass, leaves, and flowers as their fungi substrate (hence the common name "leafcutter ants") and cultivate highly derived fungi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schultz | first1 = T.

==Secondary symbiotic relationships==
There are additional symbiotic relationships that affect fungal agriculture. The fungus ''[[Escovopsis]]'' is a [[parasitism|parasite]] in ant colonies, and the bacterium ''[[Pseudonocardia]]'' has a [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship with ants. ''Pseudonocardia'' resides on the ants' integuments and assists in defending the ants from ''Escovopsis'' through the production of [[secondary metabolites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Partner fidelity==
Partner fidelity can be witnessed through vertical gene transmission of fungi when a new colony is begun.&lt;ref name="Mikheyev 1777–1782"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mikheyev|first=A |title=Convergent coevolution in the domestication of coral mushrooms by fungus-growing ants.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=271|issue=1550|pages=1777–1782|doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.2759|pmid=15315892|pmc=1691797|year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the queen must mate with several males to inseminate her many eggs before she flies off to a different location to begin a new colony. As she leaves, she takes with her a cluster of mycelium (the vegetative portion of the fungus) and actually begins a new fungal garden at her resting point using this mycelium. This grows to become the new fungal farm complete with the genes of the original cultivar preserved for another generation of ants. The relationship between attine ants and the Lepiotaceae fungus is so specialized that in many cases the Lepiotaceae is not even found outside of ant colony nests. It is clear that evolutionary pressure has been exerted on these ants to develop such an organized system in which to feed the fungus and continue its reproduction.

Studies done (with the concept of the [[prisoner's dilemma]] in mind) to test what further drives partner fidelity among species have shown that external factors are an even greater driving force. The effects of cheating ants (ants who did not bring plant biomass for fungal food) had a much smaller effect on the fitness of the relationship than when the fungi cheated by not providing gongylidia. Both effects were exacerbated in the presence of infection by escovopsis, resulting in close to a 50% loss in fungal biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Little|first=Ainslie|author2=Cameron Currie |title=Parasites may help stabilize cooperative relationships|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|pages=120–124 |year=2009|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-9-124|volume=9|pmid=19486536|pmc=2701933}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that the risk of infection from parasites is a driving external factor in keeping these two species loyal to one another. Though external factors play a large role in maintaining fidelity between the mutualists, genetic evidence of vertical transmission of partner fidelity has been found among asexual, fungus cultivating ant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kellner|first=K|title=Co-evolutionary patterns and diversification of ant–fungus associations in the asexual fungus-farming ant ''Mycocepurus smithii'' in Panama|journal=Evolutionary Biology|volume=26|issue=6|pages=1353–1362 |year=2013|doi=10.1111/jeb.12140|pmid=23639137|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors such as vertical transmission do not play as strong a role as environmental factors in maintaining fidelity, as cultivar switching among ant species is not a highly uncommon practice.&lt;ref name="Mikheyev 1777–1782"/&gt;

==Evolution==
Given the exclusive [[New World]] distribution of the over 200 [[fungus-growing ant|fungus-growing]] ant species,&lt;ref name=mueller&gt;{{cite journal|author1=U.G. Mueller |author2=T.R.

The species ''[[Cyatta abscondita]]'' is considered the most recent ancestor of all leaf-cutting ants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/5408/20131223/ghost-ant-new-species-living-fossil-ancient-fungus-farming-ants.htm| title = The Ghost Ant: New Species is a Living Fossil of Ancient Fungus-Farming Ants |publisher =Nature World News| date=Dec 23, 2013|accessdate = 24 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the ants are [[monophyletic]], their symbionts are not. They fall roughly into three major groups, only G1 having [[evolved]] [[gongylidia]]. Some G2 species grow long hyphae that form a protective cover over the nest. Those in G3 are [[paraphyletic]], the most heteregenous, and form the most loose relationships with their cultivators.&lt;ref name=chapela/&gt; Studies now show that the fungi themselves may not be completely dependent on the ants. The fungi were earlier thought to be propagated by ants purely through clonal (vegetative) means. However considerable genetic variation in the fungi suggests that this may not be the case.&lt;ref name="Mikheyev, S., U.G. Mueller, P. Abbott 2006 10702–10706"/&gt; It is hypothesized that fungi have evolved to make themselves more attractive to ant species through the development of enzymes that allow the ants to access nutrition in the fungal mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = The prominent role of fungi and fungal enzymes in the Ant–fungus biomass conversion symbiosi|publisher =National Center for Biotechnology Information| date=Apr 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ARCADIA''' ('''ARC'''HITECTURE '''A'''NALYSIS &amp; '''D'''ESIGN '''I'''NTEGRATED '''A'''PPROACH) is a [[Systems engineering|system]] and [[Software engineering|software]] architecture engineering [[Method engineering|method]], based on architecture-centric and [[model-driven engineering]] activities.

== History ==

In the development cycle of a system, former practices focused more on the definition of [[requirement]]s, their allocation to each component of the system component and associated traceability. Current approaches rather focus on [[functional analysis]], [[Systems design|system design]], justification of architectural choices and verification steps. In addition, the design takes into account not only the [[Function model|functional]] point of view, but also other points of view, which affect the definition and breakdown of the system. For example, [[Constraint (computer-aided design)|constraints]] relating to system integration, [[Product lining|product line]] management, [[safety]], [[performance]] and [[Logical possibility|feasibility]]. Systems engineering is therefore not just about managing the system requirements, but is a complex design activity.

As an answer to this challenge, the ARCADIA method was created by [[Thales Group|Thales]] in 2007, placing  [[Systems architecture|architecture]] and [[collaboration]] at the center of systems engineering practices.

The vision for ARCADIA was to break the "walls" between different engineering specializations including [[Architectural engineering|architects]], development teams, Specialists, [[Integration testing|IVVQ]] Teams, Customer and external partners.

== Normalization ==
The ARCADIA method is about to be standardized as an [[AFNOR]] experimental norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://norminfo.afnor.org/norme/pr-xp-z67-140/technologies-de-linformation-arcadia-methode-pour-lingenierie-des-systemes-soutenue-par-son-langage-de-modelisation/123795|title=Norme PR XP Z67-140 {{!}} Norm'Info|website=norminfo.afnor.org|language=fr|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been published on Mars 7, 2018.

== Context ==

The ARCADIA method applies to the design of [[Complex system|complex]] and [[Life-critical system|critical]] systems, and more generally architectures that are subject to multiple [[Non-functional requirement|functional and non-functional constraints]], including software, electronic, electrical architectures, and industrial processes. It defines a set of practices that guides needs analysis and design to meet an operational requirement. At the same time it is adaptable to the processes and constraints linked to various types of life cycles such as [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up approach]], application reuse, incremental, iterative and partial development.

== Objectives and action means ==

ARCADIA is a structured engineering method to identify and check the architecture of complex systems. It promotes collaborative work among all stakeholders during many of the engineering phases of the system. It allows iterations during the definition phase that help the architects to converge towards satisfaction of all identified needs.

Even if textual requirements are kept as a support for part of customer need capture, ARCADIA favors functional analysis as the major way to formalize the need and solution behavior. This includes operational, functional and non-functional aspects, along with resulting definition of the architecture, based on – and justified against – this functional analysis.

ARCADIA is based on the following general principles:
* All engineering stakeholders share the same language, method set of engineering artifacts and information, description of the need and the product itself as a shared model;
* Each set of constraints (e.g. safety, performance, cost, mass, etc.) is formalized in a "viewpoint" against which each candidate architecture will be checked;
* Architecture verification rules are established and the model is challenged against them, so as to check that architecture definition meets expectations, as early as possible in the process;
* Co-engineering between the different levels of engineering is supported by the joint development of models. Models of various levels of the architecture and trade-offs are deduced, validated and/or connected with each other.

The ARCADIA method is tooled through [[Capella (engineering)|Capella]], a modeling tool that meets full-scale deployment constraints in an operational context. Capella is available free of charge from the engineering community under open source.

== Feature summary ==

The ARCADIA method: 
* Covers all structured engineering activities, from capturing customer operational needs to system integration verification validation (IVV); 
* Takes into account multiple engineering levels and their effective collaboration (system, subsystem, software, hardware, etc.); 
* Integrates co-engineering with specialty engineering (safety, security, performance, interfaces, logistics ...) and IVV; 
* Provides the ability not only to share descriptive models but also to collaboratively validate properties of the definition and the architecture;
* Is field-tested in full-scale industrial applications, and is currently deployed on dozens of major projects in several countries and divisions of Thales.

== Methodological approach ==

One of the difficulties frequently encountered in the development of complex systems comes from the superposition of several partially independent functional chains using shared resources (including but not limited to computing resources). The ARCADIA method and the underlying tools are used to identify functional chains, their overlapping scenarios and desired performance, along with their support by the architecture. Starting with the first level of system analysis, they ensure traceability throughout the process definition and check each proposed architectural design against expected performance and constraints.

The non-functional properties expected from the system solution are also formalized in 'viewpoints'. Each viewpoint captures constraints that the system should face or meet (feared events, security threats, latency expectations, product line or reuse constraints, power consumption or cost issues, and more). Then the architecture model is automatically analyzed to verify that it meets these constraints, thanks to dedicated expert rules (performance computation, resource consumption, safety or security barriers, etc.). This analysis can be done very early in the development cycle, detecting design issues as soon as possible ("early validation").

As a summary, the approach to characterization by views (or "viewpoints") cross-checks that the proposed architecture is capable of providing the required functions with the desired level of performance, security, dependability, mass, scalability, environments, mass, interfaces, etc. ensuring the consistency of engineering decisions, because all engineering stakeholders share the same engineering information, and can apply his/her own views and checks to them, so as to secure the common definition.

== Presentation of the approach and key concepts ==

The first level views used to elaborate and share the architecture model are described below:

* "Define the Problem – Customer Operational Need Analysis", 
The first step focuses on analysing the customer needs and goals, expected missions and activities, far beyond System/SW requirements. This is expected to ensure good adequacy of System/SW definition with regards to its real operational use – and define IVVQ conditions.
Outputs of this step consist mainly in an "operational architecture" describing and structuring this need, in terms of actors/users, their operational capabilities and activities, operational use scenarios giving dimensioning parameters, operational constraints including safety, security, lifecycle, etc.

* "Formalisation of System/SW Requirements – System/SW Need Analysis",
The second step focuses now on the system/SW itself, in order to define how it can satisfy the former operational need, along with its expected behaviour and qualities: system/SW functions to be supported and related exchanges, non functional constraints (safety, security...), performances allocated to system boundary, role sharing and interactions between system and operators.
It also checks for feasibility (including cost, schedule and technology readiness) of customer requirements, and if necessary gives means to renegotiate their contents. To do this, a first early system/SW architecture (architectural design model) is sketched, from system/SW functional need; then requirements are examined against this architecture in order to evaluate their cost and consistency.
Outputs of this step mainly consist of system/SW functional Need description, interoperability and interaction with the users and external systems (functions, exchanges plus non-functional constraints), and system/SW requirements.

Note that these two steps, which constitute the first part of Architecture building, "specify" the further design, and therefore should be approved/validated with the customer.

* "Development of System/SW Architecture – Logical Architecture", 
The third step intends to identify the system/SW parts (hereafter called components), their contents, relationships and properties, excluding implementation or technical/technological issues. This constitutes the system/SW logical architecture.
In order for this breakdown in components to be stable in further steps, all major [non-functional] constraints (safety, security, performance, IVV, Cost, non technical, etc.) are taken into account and compared to each other's so as to find the best compromise between them. 
This method is described as "Viewpoints-driven", viewpoints being the formalization of the way these constraints impact the system/SW architecture.
Outputs of this step consist of the selected logical architecture: components and interfaces definition, including formalization of all viewpoints and the way they are taken into account in the components design. 
Since the architecture has to be validated against Need, links with requirements and operational scenarios are also produced.

* "Development of System/SW Architecture – Physical Architecture",
The fourth step has the same intents as logical architecture building, except that it defines the "final" architecture of the system/SW at this level of engineering, ready to develop (by lower engineering levels). Therefore, it introduces rationalization, architectural patterns, new technical services and components, and makes the logical architecture evolve according to implementation, technical and technological constraints and choices (at this level of engineering). 
Note that the same "Viewpoints-driven" method as for logical architecture building is used for physical architecture definition.
Outputs of this step consist of the selected physical architecture: components to be produced, including formalization of all viewpoints and the way they are taken into account in the components design. Links with requirements and operational scenarios are also produced.

* "Formalize Components Requirements – Contracts for Development and IVVQ",
The fifth and last step is a contribution to EPBS (End-Product Breakdown Structure) building, taking benefits from the former architectural work, to enforce components requirements definition, and prepare a secured IVVQ.
All choices associated to the system/SW chosen architecture, and all hypothesis and constraints imposed to components and architecture to fit need and constraints, are summarized and checked here.
Outputs from this step are mainly "component Integration contract" collected all necessary expected properties for each component to be developed.

The following figure shows a global view summarizing the recommended technical process, featuring the three elements of the engineering triptych, and their production activities all along the definition and design process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32620">'''Arts-based environmental education''' (AEE) brings [[art education]] and [[environmental education]] together in one undertaking. The approach has two essential characteristics. The first is that it refers to a specific kind of environmental education that starts off from an artistic approach. Different from other types of [[Outdoor education|outdoor]] or environmental education which offer room for aesthetic experiences, AEE turns the tables in a fundamental way. Art is not an added quality, the icing on the cake; it is rather the point of departure in the effort to find ways in which people can connect to their environment. A second fundamental characteristic is that AEE is one of the first contemporary approaches of bringing together artistic practice and environmental education in which practitioners also made an attempt to formulate an [[epistemology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/janvanboeckel/docs/jvanboeckel-attheheartofart-def_low/1 van Boeckel, J. (2013). At the Heart of Art and Earth: An Exploration of Practices in Arts-based Environmental Education. Helsinki: Aalto University, School of Arts, Design and Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The roots of arts-based environmental education as it was developed in Finland ==

The term "arts-based environmental education" (AEE) was first coined by Finnish art educator Meri-Helga Mantere in the 1990s. Mantere describes AEE as a form of learning that aims to develop environmental understanding and responsibility “by becoming more receptive to sense perceptions and observations and by using artistic methods to express personal environmental experiences and thoughts”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturearteducation.org/Articles/Foreword%20to%20Image%20of%20the%20Earth.pdf Mantere, M.-H. (1995). Foreword. In M.-H. Mantere (Ed.), Image of the Earth: Writings on art-based environmental education. (M. Barron, Trans.). (pp. 1-2). Helsinki: University of Art of Design], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Artistic experiences improve one's ability to see; they help one in knowing and understanding. Therefore, she maintains that these can be of high value in learning about the environment. Mantere's description of her method of art-based environmental education can be taken as a first attempt at a definition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"What do I do as an environmentalist and as an art teacher? To put it rather simply: I try to support fresh perception, the nearby, personal enjoyment and pleasure of perceiving the world from the heart. To achieve that, it is necessary to stop, be quiet, have time and feel psychologically secure in order to perceive the unknown, the sometimes wild and unexpected. At times conscious training of the senses, decoding the stereotype, is needed. I aim at an openness to sensitivity, new and personal ways to articulate and share one’s environmental experiences which might be beautiful, disgusting, peaceful or threatening. I support and facilitate the conversation with the environment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturearteducation.org/Articles/Art%20and%20the%20environment.pdf Mantere, M.-H. (1998). Art and the environment: An art-based approach to environmental education. In L. Rubinstein Reich (Ed.), Rapporter om utbildning, 3 (pp. 30-35). Malmö, Sweden: Lärarhögskolan.], p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In short, Mantere's conception of AEE is grounded on the belief that sensitivity to the environment can be developed by artistic activities.&lt;ref&gt;Mantere, M.-H. (1995). Foreword. In M.-H. Mantere (Ed.), Image of the Earth: Writings on art-based environmental education. (M. Barron, Trans.). (pp. 1-2). Helsinki: University of Art of Design, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; As an artist, and as a teacher and therapist, she came to find it more and more important to go back to the basics of the process and skill of perception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturearteducation.org/Articles/Coming%20Back%20to%20the%20Senses.pdf Mantere, M.-H. (2004). Coming back to the senses: An artistic approach to environmental education.]&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the question of how we perceive and how we receive or reject the messages of the environment is central. Important to underline - because it counters possible allegations of embracing a too Romantic view of nature – is that there is also room for the “shadow” side of experience, for feelings of disgust, fear and agony.

=== Early years of development ===

The historical antecedents of arts-based environmental education as it was developed in [[Finland]] go back to 1971, the year that the first European regional InSEA congress was held in that country. Finnish art educators had pooled their efforts to arrange this meeting
with the overarching theme “Environmental Protection in Art Education.” Pirkko Pohjakallio is a specialist on multidisciplinary approaches to environmental education in the context of Finnish art education since the 1970s. Quoting Kauppinen (1972), she provides the rationale for the congress at the time: “One reason for making the theme was the wish to emphasize the manifoldness and diversity of our environmental problems – [they] are not purely biological, economic and social ones but also aesthetic ones, and are consequently part of art education, not only as separate subjects of study but also as integrated parts of other subjects dealing with our living environment” (Kauppinen,&lt;ref&gt;Kauppinen, H. (1972). Preface (VII). In H. Kauppinen (Ed.), Environment and art education. InSEA 1971. Helsinki: Finnish Art Teachers’ Association.&lt;/ref&gt; cited in Pohjakallio, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturearteducation.org/Articles/Pohjakallio.pdf Pohjakallio, P. (2007). Mapping environmental education approaches in Finnish art education.]&lt;/ref&gt; Already at that time, as Meri-Helga Mantere, notes, attention was paid to aesthetic and critical observation of the environment, both in the education of art teachers and in the curricula of Finnish schools. In the first decade, the focus of the kind of environmental education, practiced in Finland as part of art education, was on the man-made environment. Subjects were environmental pollution and the exploitation of nature. Problems of the environment were visually approached in teaching by identifying, classifying and listing the types and degrees of damages. As Mantere summarizes, “the emphasis was not so much on the environment as it was on politics”.&lt;ref&gt;Pohjakallio, P. (2007). Mapping environmental education approaches in Finnish art education, p. 95]&lt;/ref&gt;).

Similarly, also Pirkko Pohjakallio notes that in the early 1970s, the prevailing interest in art teacher education and in visual arts first was in cultural studies and in linguistic and conceptual directions. The emphasis was on interpretations of expressions
of visual communication and on investigating if these revealed ideology and relations of power. It was a progressive move away from integrating art with crafts in the curriculum. Environmental education, at the time, concentrated on problems, and this was reflected in the images that were created in art classes, representing “dying nature, spoilt built environments, factories that polluted, and chaotic traffic jams”.&lt;ref&gt;Pohjakallio, P. (2007). Mapping environmental education approaches in Finnish art education, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In these times of social activism, practicing and becoming art teachers read the ecological and political pamphlets of the time. However, when they tried to address the themes and questions during art lessons, these proved so wide and difficult, that neither pupils nor teacher could envisage any solutions, leading to feelings of despair rather than empowerment. Ultimately this led to a dead end: “the use of conscious, threatening environmental scenarios and political topicalities as intellectual fuel proved to be a questionable idea”.

=== Change in the 1980s ===

The 1980s saw a change in Finland. From first being a subject that was limited to environmentally conscious groups and individuals interested in nature conservation, the earth's ecological state started to capture the interest of the general public. Art teaching gravitated to assisting learners in acquiring skills in reading and evaluating the language of the man-made environment. Parallel to that, in teacher education, issues stemming from environmental psychology and environmental aesthetics were discussed. Towards the end of the decade, new trends emerged. Art educators began to develop activities that were strongly influenced by down-to-earth phenomena in
environmental art and the new ecological awareness. A key figure in this development of a new approach to environmental education in the 1980s, as Pirkko Pohjakallio notes, was Meri-Helga Mantere. To the latter, an artistically oriented environmental education would be at its best when the artistic and creative perspective would run through the teaching project, from the stage of its planning to the evaluation of its results. Effectively, what this implied was that in the entire environmental education process the emphasis would be on the manner of observing, experiencing and thinking that is customary to art.&lt;ref&gt;Pohjakallio, P. (2007). Mapping environmental education approaches in Finnish art education&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas before, art students, on basis of the prevailing orientation at the time of linguistic methods and critical theory, typically used collage of media images rather than personal and intimate contact with the actual environment, this now all began to change. To be sure, students were taken outdoors before by art educators as well, taking their pencils, drawing pads and brushes along. Here's the contrast, in Mantere's own words: "Now the purpose is to search for a more direct connection with the materiality as well as spirituality of nature. Sand, water, or any other environmental material became tools for reflection and expression. Also allusions to the mythical meanings of nature could be a starting point in the art exercises given to students."&lt;ref&gt;Mantere, M.-H. (1992). Phenomena of the 80’s: Post-modern art education? Images in time: Essays on art education in Finland (pp. 89-97). Helsinki: University of Art of Design.&lt;/ref&gt;

When in the 1980s new expressionist painting, earth and environmental art emerged in society, these “were greeted as a breath of fresh air by art educators after the threatening images of the 1970s that had failed to empower those who had created them.”.&lt;ref&gt;Pohjakallio, P. (2007). Mapping environmental education approaches in Finnish art education, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Art students participated in courses on environmental pedagogy and camp schools were organized in “unspoilt” environments such as the Finnish archipelago and Lapland. Pohjakallio lists the following sources of inspiration for the new activities: deep ecology, gestalt therapy, experimental learning theories, and environmental aesthetics. Mantere notes that the ability and experience of Finnish art teachers to work in environmental education through artistic means began to draw the interest of environmental educators in general. What was attractive to them was this insight: “Attitudes and values do not seem to change through teaching that emphasizes scientific facts”.&lt;ref&gt;Mantere, M.-H. (1992). Phenomena of the 80’s: Post-modern art education? Images in time: Essays on art education in Finland (pp. 89-97). Helsinki: University of Art of Design.&lt;/ref&gt; By consequence, she adds, emotional, aesthetic and practical methods became more and more appreciated. What came into focus was the pupil's own relationship with nature and the environment, which implied a holistic and hermeneutic approach to environmental issues. Pohjakallio adds that in the newly emerging arts-based environmental education, the life-world approach came to stand central. Through that emphasis on the idea that the environment is, first of all, ''inhabited'' by persons and not something remote or detached, aspects were taken up that had been mostly neglected in art education's earlier bearings in formalist and semiotic approaches. Characteristically, the inhabitant's relationship with the environment was participatory rather than solely informed by focused attention. It involved a two-way influence and identification:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In this approach, the environment is as much a drama and narrative as a set of critical insights and political views. In life-world, environmental aesthetics, all the senses contribute to understanding, so that the environment is as much felt as understood. It is partly a tacit affair – but not, as a consequence, beyond theorizing."&lt;ref&gt;Pohjakallio, P. (2007). Mapping environmental education approaches in Finnish art education, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We thus see that the 1980s were in many respects a turning point. It saw the genesis of, what Mantere termed, the new environmental education (through art). A movement had emerged in art education, in which, according to Mantere, the freedom and courage to have confidence in “art as art” was central. Concomitantly, the word “process” became nothing less than essential, and the artistic process came to be seen not only as a psychically integrative, individual experience but also as a (if not the most)legitimate basis for the teaching of art. The ideas of Jung and art therapy in general influenced and inspired many Finnish art teachers. As Mantere puts it, “one could hardly talk about the soul in public, [but] one could at least talk about some kind of spirituality”.&lt;ref&gt;Mantere, M.-H. (1992). Phenomena of the 80’s: Post-modern art education? In M. Laukka, M. Lähteenaho, &amp; P. Pohjakallio (Eds.), Images in time: Essays on art education in Finland (pp. 89-97). Helsinki: Faculty of Art Education, University of Industrial Arts, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical of the time was that many teachers began to discuss their own situation as artists.

An important parallel development was the emergence in Finland of special art schools for children. In contrast to the compulsory comprehensive schools, these provided a new opportunity to develop artistically demanding and at cases long-term projects.

=== The importance of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit and the rise of the concept of sustainability ===

In 1992, a little more than twenty years after the landmark 1971 InSEA conference in Helsinki, the [[Earth Summit]] took place in Rio de Janeiro, the big UN Conference on Environment and Development. Again, an InSEA conference was held in Finland. At this occasion, Mantere articulated the specific Finnish approach to an international readership more fully in her seminal article “Ecology, Environmental Education and Art Teaching” (which appeared in the InSEA publication ''Power of Images'', 1992).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturearteducation.org/Articles/Ecology,%20Environmental%20Education%20and%20Art%20Teaching.pdf Mantere, M.-H. (1992). Ecology, environmental education and art teaching. In L. Piironen (Ed.), Power of images, Helsinki: InSEA-Finland.]&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote that, in her view, ecological thinking and action should be regarded as a guiding principle of all education. Furthermore, art education could play an important
role in the development of new forms of environmental education. To her, a genuine appreciation of nature and motivation to act for the good of the environment are based above all on positive and valued experiences and these are often of an aesthetic nature. Such experiences, she went on to say, can be generated by open and immediate contact with the phenomena of nature and the often new and fresh view of these phenomena that art provides. To her, to perceive “better” is the necessary starting point to creative change
in personal and collective decision making and lifestyles.

Mantere presents several arguments to support her claim that art education can play an important role in the new environmental education. All of these rely, as she puts it in her article in ''Power of Images'', on “the artistic apprehension” of life and the environment, and on the opportunities that lend themselves to artistic influence.&lt;ref&gt;Mantere, M.-H. (1992). Ecology, environmental education and art teaching. In L. Piironen (Ed.), Power of images, Helsinki: InSEA-Finland, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; To begin with, she emphasizes that appreciating one's experiences, emotional expressions and subjective processing of things is at the core of art education. For that reason, aesthetic practice could be an extremely valuable contribution to experiential learning in environmental education (which she held as the latter's most fruitful and functional principle). In artmaking, participants learn by doing. Everything begins with personal experience. Simultaneously, art teaching encourages participants to discover, unearth and also to lend weight to their own mental images. These two combined, mean that art education can offer a mode in which learners can engage with their experiences and observations of the environment through artistic activity. This can be done by working with mental images, tangible pictorial expressions, etc., and by bringing to bear matured levels of reflection and conceptualization. As such, artistic activity actually constitutes cognitive action and learning in its own right.

Secondly, Mantere also underscores the need to create positive visions and concepts for the future. Sustainable development is not only about conservation but also about creating the new: better environments, objects and lifestyles. It is in the design of these that art education can play a vital role. Moreover, it is of great value if pupils become active themselves on behalf of the environment, in short, that a change of attitude is brought about. Finally, Mantere calls attention in her article to the critical insight that when an ecological lifestyle is primarily seen in terms of restriction and austerity, then it is more likely that change will only be accepted as a last resort. Through art, “it is also possible to develop the mythical, metaphorical and deep-level psychological levels of man’s relationship with nature into a constructive resource, in which factual information achieves deeper meanings”.&lt;ref&gt;Mantere, M.-H. (1992). Ecology, environmental education and art teaching. In L. Piironen (Ed.), Power of images, Helsinki: InSEA-Finland, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; For Mantere, art is often therapeutic, but this aspect is seldom mentioned.

=== AEE and environmental art ===
In his article “From Environmental Art to Environmental Education,”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturearteducation.org/Articles/From%20environmental%20art%20to%20environmental%20education_Timo%20Jokela.pdf Jokela, T. (1995). From environmental art to environmental education. In M.-H. Mantere (Ed.), Image of the earth: Writings on art-based environmental education (pp. 18-28). Helsinki: University of Art and Design.]&lt;/ref&gt; Timo Jokela, professor in art education at the University of Lapland, claims that the visual arts can offer elements to environmental education that are lacking in other fields. To him, “artistic-aesthetic learning” involves observation, experience and increasing awareness. Art sharpens our schemes of observation and activity, and thus facilitates bringing the phenomena to our consciousness. Art continuously creates new ways of observing. Even more so, visual art can be understood as actually being a history of evolving and varying schemes of observation. Previous learning experiences dominate the way in which we subsequently observe and describe our environment, says Jokela. He underpins this claim by quoting [[Arnold Berleant]], as follows: “environments are not physical places but perceptual ones that we collaborate in making, and it is perceptually that we determine their identity and extent”.&lt;ref&gt;Berleant, quoted in Jokela, T. (1995). From environmental art to environmental education. In M.-H. Mantere (Ed.), Image of the earth: Writings on art-based environmental education (pp. 18-28). Helsinki: University of Art and Design, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

For Jokela, the “environmental world” and the “art world” share an educational task. [[Environmental art]], for him, is first and foremost art that is defined by the place it is made; it is created, as it were, by the environment. Its historical antecedents go back
to the 1960s (e.g. the practices of “[[earth art]]” and “[[land art]]”). The Finnish art educator goes on to list four types of exercises that illustrate how environmental art can be a method of environmental education. On the one hand, these exercises are faithful to the practice of environmental art and as such they are a basic part of art education. On the other hand, they are also methods for increasing one's sensitivity towards the environment. In the latter sense, they are essentially environmental education. These are the categories that Jokela provides:

•  Exercises on focusing your observations and perceiving them more sensitively;

•  Exercises which bring forward the processes happening in nature, and help one in perceiving them more sensitively: growth and decay, the flow of water, the turning of day and night, the changes of light, the wind, etc.;

•  Exercises which aim to alter set ways of viewing the environment;

•  Exercises which test the scale of the environment and human “limits.” The starting point is a large amount of material and the aim is a clear change in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Jokela, T. (1995). From environmental art to environmental education. In M.-H. Mantere (Ed.), Image of the earth: Writings on art-based environmental education (pp. 18-28). Helsinki: University of Art and Design, p. 25-36&lt;/ref&gt;

A binding factor in Jokela's categories is the implicit driving force: they are exercises that work towards achieving or accomplishing a pre-established goal; they “aim at.” Mantere makes an illuminating distinction between (a) seeing art as a tool of environmental education, (b) seeing art itself as a form of environmental education and (c) seeing environmental education as a form of art. Each alternative, she says, is possible and tones the content and activity in a different way.&lt;ref&gt;Mantere, M.-H. (1995). Tracking a course in the landscape of environmental education. In M.-H. Mantere (Ed.), Image of the Earth: Writings on art-based environmental education. (M. Barron, Trans.). (pp. 3-17). Helsinki: University of Art of Design&lt;/ref&gt;

=== AEE: nor 'pure' environmental education, nor 'pure' arts education ===
A composite approach such as arts-based environmental education inevitably always seems to fall between two stools: it is neither environmental education proper (because it starts off from an arts- rather than science-based perspective), nor can it convincingly be classified as a subfield of art education, as it moves away from artmaking as primarily a self-referential discipline (“l’art pour l’art”). In fact, one could say that two rather separate communities of art educators and environmental educators exist, often not understanding (or more often not aware of) each other's discourse, hence bringing along the problem of incommensurability of the paradigms from which they each approach education.

In an interview that Jan van Boeckel held with Mantere in 2007, he invited her to expand further on her conceptualization of the combining of art education and environmental education, and the way she considered that participants learn about the environment through art:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"One learns by observing the connection between outer and inner. One learns by using the senses. One gets sensitive when one learns that all the senses are (or can be) involved. When they are involved or enlivened or opened, you also get more original feelings or observations. The observations that one makes of art, of nature, of other people and one’s self, the environment or whatever, can be led by knowledge, learning theories, and so on, and that is one way to observe. In such cases one already has some kind of frame or concepts. But in this case the learning comes from being open to, and learning through, one’s senses. At those moments there are no ready-made words, concepts and structures. The artistic learning, or the artistic approach, goes to the basics of senses and feelings, to the fresh contact and presence. An artistic approach includes the sensitivity of one’s body movement and senses. Via sight or touch you study the environment, but if you hurry to name it you lose the newness. You get a touch, you get a smell, you get movement, you hear your environment. And when this happens without naming and ready-made concepts and repetitions, you always get a new experience. It is possible to get fresh, nonverbal information all the time. So the senses and observations can be creative and they kind of bring up your own images, words and conceptualizations."&lt;ref&gt;M.-H. Mantere, cited in van Boeckel, J. (2013). At the Heart of Art and Earth: An Exploration of Practices in Arts-based Environmental Education. Helsinki: Aalto University, School of Arts, Design and Architecture, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here, Mantere touches upon two contrasting forces within AEE: the more passive not-knowing while being open to one's senses, and the more active learning that takes place when integrating the new information. One has to shift, as it were, from one state of mind to the other.

One way to understand an AEE activity is to see it as a facilitated effort in which participants are encouraged to open their senses and to connect to and learn from their environment. The pedagogical point of departure in this is artistic practice rather than science-based learning. This orientation, however, should not be seen as being in opposition to other approaches of learning and acquiring knowledge. Instead, artmaking is conceived of as a (as of yet highly undervalued) way of learning and understanding in itself, complementary to other modes.

As we saw, Mantere herself emphasizes in her texts the value of experiential subjective learning processes, which she contrasts with science-based experimental knowledge. At the same time, she underlines that an art educator needs to know the scientific ecological basics like cycles of water and energy and materials used; he or she needs to be aware of the ecological threats of today: “I think that to plan an AEE workshop or lesson not knowing or caring about the ecological aspects is not environmental education at all and thus not AEE as I understand it”.&lt;ref&gt;M.-H. Mantere, cited in van Boeckel, J. (2013). At the Heart of Art and Earth: An Exploration of Practices in Arts-based Environmental Education. Helsinki: Aalto University, School of Arts, Design and Architecture, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in her view, art educators ought to be able to explain in what ways the arts and aesthetics may contribute to enhancing the aims of EE as a whole, in cases where they work together with science teachers.

Nevertheless, she also holds that AEE methods, in the effort to support perceiving the world from the heart, can only achieve such fresh perception through a stop. For it is at that point that learners begin to be receptive and “to perceive the unknown, the
delicate, the sometimes wild and unexpected”.&lt;ref&gt;Mantere, M.-H. (1998). Art and the environment: An art-based approach to environmental education. In L. Rubinstein Reich (Ed.), Rapporter om utbildning, 3 (pp. 30-35). Malmö, Sweden: Lärarhögskolan, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; When, through conscious training in the senses, the predominant cultural and personal stereotypes are decoded, not only the participant's perception becomes very different, but also his or her articulation of these in words and picture. When the subjective is both supported and facilitated by the art teacher, “more and more unconventional conversations with the environment follow”.&lt;ref&gt;Mantere, M.-H. (2004). Coming back to the senses: An artistic approach to environmental education.&lt;/ref&gt; From her background in art, Mantere has tried to meet the challenges posed by the environmental imperatives of today. She did this by using strategies and methods that are derived from experience and knowledge of art and art education and even the world of art therapy. She mentions that important sources of inspiration were some of the Finnish traditions connected with the forest and the international field of environmental art. Further, philosopher [[Arne Næss|Arne Naess]] and psychologist [[James Hillman]] were important mentors to her. Art touches the heart and it is the speech of soul, she quotes the latter saying.&lt;ref&gt;Mantere, M.-H. (2004). Coming back to the senses: An artistic approach to environmental education.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Summary ===
In this overview of the way in which a specific form of arts-based environmental education developed in Finland the following core traits to be distinguished. First, one has to distinguish between the first phase of AEE in the 1970s which focused on visual imagery of the ecological crisis, and its second phase, when this perspective was complemented – if not to some extent replaced – by a more sensorially-grounded approach in which personal direct experiences of both the natural and built environment became characteristic. It is to this second phase of AEE, which emerged in the 1980s, that my attention is mostly focused, the idea that a relationship with nature can be built through the senses: the art teacher puts his or her trust in experiential learning and the teaching can move out of the classroom. The pupils are encouraged to open their senses by artistic practices, which can be almost anything from drawing and building out of natural materials to making conceptual art. Through these practices it is hoped that the pupils recognize and study their own relationship with the surrounding environment. In this, the artistic result is less important. The goal for art education is to emotionally involve pupils and to develop their ability to see the traces we leave in the landscape.

Part of this is to see the environment through art, and art through the environment.  People would be educated by that environmental art or sculpture and it is a good approach to do art-base environmental education.&lt;ref&gt;M. Marks, L. Chandler &amp; C. Baldwin (2016): Environmental art as an innovative medium for environmental education in Biosphere Reserves, Environmental Education Research, DOI: 10.1080/13504622.2016.1214864
&lt;/ref&gt; A forest, for example, can provide the materials for making art – interpreted by traditional techniques or through conceptual art. Part of the focus is to train the students’ artistic view, so that they see and express aesthetic qualities and values in both the built and natural environment. Distinctive to the Finnish approach is an inclination to keep the process open-ended and not to work necessarily towards reaching a preconceived and –defined goal, and the other is that practitioners of the teaching of AEE tend to see the importance of (and actively engage in) the unpacking of the epistemological foundations of their work. In her foreword to the book ''Image of the Earth, Writing on Art-based Environmental Education'', Mantere speaks of a “we,” that is a group of Finnish artists and art teachers at the university level. Though she grants that the book is not a comprehensive account of AEE, the opening lines do have an authoritative and programmatic ring to them:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We believe that it is possible to develop environmental understanding and responsibility by becoming more receptive to sense perceptions and observations, and by using artistic methods to express personal environmental experiences and thoughts. Artistic experiences and activities improve one’s ability to see; they help one in knowing and understanding. The issues of values and lifestyle, raised by the ecological crisis, can be approached by artistic methods, reaching otherwise unattainable areas of experience."&lt;ref&gt;Mantere, M.-H. (1995).

[[File:Space zucchini.jpg|thumb|A zucchini being grown on the International Space Station]]'''Astrobotany''' is an applied sub-discipline of [[botany]] that is the study of plants in space environments. It is a branch of [[astrobiology]] and botany.

It has been a subject of study that [[plants]] may be grown in [[outer space]] typically in a weightless but pressurized controlled environment in specific space gardens.&lt;ref name="Mizuna"&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/10-074.html NASA - Growing Plants and Vegetables in a Space Garden]&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of human spaceflight, they can be consumed as food and/or provide a refreshing atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/spacelife/topics/plants/index.html NASA - Plants in Space]&lt;/ref&gt; Plants can metabolize carbon dioxide in the air to produce valuable oxygen, and can help control cabin humidity.&lt;ref name=zvet/&gt; Growing plants in space may provide a psychological benefit to human spaceflight crews.&lt;ref name=zvet/&gt;

The first challenge in growing plants in space is how to get plants to grow without gravity.&lt;ref name="root"&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/tages.html NASA - Getting to The Root of Plant Growth Aboard The Space Station]&lt;/ref&gt; This runs into difficulties regarding the effects of gravity on root development, providing appropriate types of lighting, and other challenges. In particular, the nutrient supply to root as well as the nutrient biogeochemical cycles, and the microbiological interactions in soil-based substrates are particularly complex, but have been shown to make possible [[space farming]] in hypo- and micro-gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.asr.2010.07.012|title = Martian base agriculture: The effect of low gravity on water flow, nutrient cycles, and microbial biomass dynamics| journal=Advances in Space Research| volume=46| issue=10| pages=1257–1265|year = 2010|last1 = Maggi|first1 = Federico| last2=Pallud| first2=Céline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2010.09.025. | doi=10.1016/j.pss.2010.09.025| title=Space agriculture in micro- and hypo-gravity: A comparative study of soil hydraulics and biogeochemistry in a cropping unit on Earth, Mars, the Moon and the space station| journal=Planetary and Space Science| volume=58| issue=14–15| pages=1996–2007| year=2010| last1=Maggi| first1=Federico| last2=Pallud| first2=Céline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extraterrestrial vegetation ==
[[File:Exoplanet Surface Water Life Exomoon.png|thumb|Astobotany has been the investigation of the idea that alien plant life may exist on other planets. Here an artist has envisioned alien plants on shores of an exomoon exosea]]
The search for vegetation on other planets began with Gavriil Tikhov, who attempted to detect extraterrestrial vegetation via analyzing the wavelengths of a planet's reflected light, or [[planetshine]]. Photosynthetic pigments, like chlorophylls on Earth, reflect light spectra that spike in the range of 700-750&amp;nbsp;nm. This pronounced spike is referred to as "vegetation's red edge."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seager|first=S.|last2=Turner|first2=E.l.|last3=Schafer|first3=J.|last4=Ford|first4=E.b.|date=2005-06-01|title=Vegetation's Red Edge: A Possible Spectroscopic Biosignature of Extraterrestrial Plants|journal=Astrobiology|volume=5|issue=3|pages=372–390|doi=10.1089/ast.2005.5.372|pmid=15941381|issn=1531-1074|arxiv=astro-ph/0503302|bibcode=2005AsBio...5..372S}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was thought that observing this spike in a reading of planetshine would signal a surface covered in green vegetation.

==Growing plants in space==
The study of plant response in space environments is another subject of astrobotany research. In space, plants encounter unique environmental stressors not found on Earth including [[microgravity]], ionizing radiation, and oxidative stress.&lt;ref&gt;http://astrobotany.com/plants-and-spaceflight/ | Challenges of Growing Plants in Space&lt;/ref&gt;  Experiments have shown that these stressors cause genetic alterations in plant metabolism pathways. Changes in genetic expression have shown that plants respond on a molecular level to a space environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s11431-016-0232-7|title = The impact of space environment on gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings| journal=Science China Technological Sciences| volume=60| issue=6| pages=902–910|year = 2017|last1 = Li|first1 = Huasheng| last2=Lu| first2=Jinying| last3=Zhao| first3=Hui| last4=Sun| first4=Qiao| last5=Yu| first5=Futong| last6=Pan| first6=Yi| last7=Chen| first7=Yu| last8=Su| first8=Liang| last9=Liu| first9=Min}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astrobotanical research has been applied to the challenges of creating life support systems both in space and on other planets, primarily Mars.

==History==
Russian scientist [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] was one of the first people to discuss using photosynthetic life as a resource in space agricultural systems. Speculation about plant cultivation in space has been around since the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/opag.2017.2.issue-1/opag-2017-0002/opag-2017-0002.pdf  | Agriculture for Space: People and Places Paving the Way&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''astrobotany'' was first used in 1945 by Russian astronomer and astrobiology pioneer [[Gavriil Adrianovich Tikhov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Briot, Danielle|year=2013|title=The Creator of Astrobotany, Gavriil Adrianovich Tikhov|journal=Astrobiology, History, and Society|page=175|bibcode=2013ahs..book..175B|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-35983-5_8|series=Advances in Astrobiology and Biogeophysics|isbn=978-3-642-35982-8}}  | The Creator of Astrobotany, Gavriil Adrianovich Tikhov&lt;/ref&gt; Tikhov is considered to be the father of astrobotany.

=== Seeds ===
The first organisms in space were "specially developed strains of seeds" launched to {{convert|134|km|mi|abbr=on}} on 9 July 1946 on a U.S. launched [[V-2 rocket]]. These samples were not recovered. The first seeds launched into space and successfully recovered were [[maize]] seeds launched on 30 July 1946. Soon followed [[rye]] and [[cotton]]. These early [[suborbital]] biological experiments were handled by [[Harvard University]] and the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] and were concerned with [[Ionizing radiation|radiation exposure]] on living tissue.&lt;ref name=Beischer1962&gt;{{cite journal |author=Beischer, DE |author2=Fregly, AR |title=Animals and man in space.

=== Plants for life support in space ===
[[File:Growing Plants and Vegetables in a Space Garden.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Growing%20Plants%20and%20Vegetables%20in%20a%20Space%20Garden.jpg|thumb|Lettuce being grown and harvested in the International Space Station before being frozen and returned to Earth.]]
Algae was the first candidate for human-plant life support systems. Initial research in the 1950s and 1960s used ''Chlorella, Anacystis, Synechocystis, Scenedesmus, Synechococcus,'' and ''Spirulina'' species to study how photosynthetic organisms could be used for O2 and CO2 cycling in closed systems.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wheeler|first=Ray|date=2011-01-01|title=Plants for human life support in space: From Myers to Mars|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228484167|journal=Gravitational and Space Biology|volume=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later research through Russia’s BIOS program and USA’s CELSS program investigated the use of higher plants to fulfill the roles of atmospheric regulators, waste recyclers, and food for sustained missions. The crops most commonly studied include starch crops such as wheat, potato, and rice; protein-rich crops such as soy, peanut, and common bean; and a host of other nutrition-enhancing crops like lettuce, strawberry, and kale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wheeler|first=Ray|last2=Sager|first2=John|date=2018-04-08|title=Crop Production for Advanced Life Support Systems|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27237666|journal=Technical Reports}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests for optimal growth conditions in closed systems have required research both into environmental parameters necessary for particular crops (such as differing light periods for short-day versus long-day crops) and cultivars that are a best-fit for life support system growth.

Tests of human-plant life support systems in space are relatively few compared to similar testing performed on Earth and micro-gravity testing on plant growth in space. The first life support systems testing performed in space included gas exchange experiments with wheat, potato, and giant duckweed (''Spyrodela polyrhiza''). Smaller scale projects, sometimes referred to as "salad machines", have been used to provide fresh produce to astronauts as a dietary supplement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Future studies have been planned to investigate the effects of keeping plants on the mental well-being of humans in confined environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elib.dlr.de/94135/|title=Demonstration test of electrical lighting systems for plant growth in HI-SEAS analog mars habitat|last=Lucie|first=Poulet,|last2=D.|first2=Massa, G.|date=2014|website=elib.dlr.de|language=en|access-date=2018-04-08|last3=R.|first3=Wheeler,|last4=T.|first4=Gill,|last5=R.|first5=Morrow,|last6=C.|first6=Steele,|last7=T.|first7=Swarmer,|last8=K.|first8=Binsted,|last9=J.|first9=Hunter,}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent research has been focused on extrapolating these life support systems to other planets, primarily Martian bases. Interlocking closed systems called "modular biospheres" have been prototyped to support four- to five-person crews on the Martian surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003-01-01|title=Development and research program for a soil-based bioregenerative agriculture system to feed a four person crew at a Mars base|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117702006610|journal=Advances in Space Research|language=en|volume=31|issue=1|pages=69–75|doi=10.1016/S0273-1177(02)00661-0|issn=0273-1177|bibcode=2003AdSpR..31...69S|last1=Silverstone|first1=S|last2=Nelson|first2=M|last3=Alling|first3=A|last4=Allen|first4=J}}&lt;/ref&gt; These encampments are designed as inflatable greenhouses and bases.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050182966.pdf#page=130|title=Mars Greenhouses: Concepts and Challenges|last=Wheeler|first=R.M.|publisher=NASA|year=2000|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are anticipated to use Martian soils for growth substrate and wastewater treatment, and crop cultivars developed specifically for extraplanetary life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003-01-01|title=Advantages of using subsurface flow constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment in space applications: Ground-based mars base prototype|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117703000139|journal=Advances in Space Research|language=en|volume=31|issue=7|pages=1799–1804|doi=10.1016/S0273-1177(03)00013-9|issn=0273-1177|bibcode=2003AdSpR..31.1799N|last1=Nelson|first1=M|last2=Alling|first2=A|last3=Dempster|first3=W.

== Plant research==
The study of plant research has yielded information useful to other areas of botany and horticulture. Extensive research into hydroponics systems was fielded successfully by NASA in both the CELSS and ALS programs, as well as the effects of increased photoperiod and light intensity for various crop species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Research also led to optimization of yields beyond what had been previously achieved by indoor cropping systems. Intensive studying of gas exchange and plant volatile concentrations in closed systems led to increased understanding of plant response to extreme levels of gases such as carbon dioxide and ethylene. Usage of LEDs in closed life support systems research also prompted the increased use of LEDs in indoor growing operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morrow|first=Robert C.|date=2008-12-01|title=LED Lighting in Horticulture|url=http://hortsci.ashspublications.org/content/43/7/1947|journal=HortScience|language=en|volume=43|issue=7|pages=1947–1950|issn=0018-5345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several experiments have been focused on how plant growth and distribution compares in micro-gravity, space conditions versus Earth conditions. This enables scientists to explore whether certain plant growth patterns are innate or environmentally driven. For instance, Allan H. Brown tested seedling movements aboard the [[Space Shuttle Columbia]] in 1983. Sunflower seedling movements were recorded while in orbit. They observed that the seedlings still experienced rotational growth and circumnation despite lack of gravity, showing these behaviors are built-in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chamovitz|first1=Daniel|title=What a plant knows : a field guide to the senses|date=2012|publisher=Scientific American/Farrar, Straus and Giroux|location=New York|isbn=978-0-374-28873-0|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other experiments have found that plants have the ability exhibit [[gravitropism]], even in low-gravity conditions. For instance, the ESA's European Modular Cultivation System&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jost|first1=Ann-Iren Kittang|last2=Hoson|first2=Takayuki|last3=Iversen|first3=Tor-Henning|title=The Utilization of Plant Facilities on the International Space Station—The Composition, Growth, and Development of Plant Cell Walls under Microgravity Conditions|journal=Plants|date=20 January 2015|volume=4|issue=1|pages=44–62|doi=10.3390/plants4010044|issn=2223-7747|pmc=4844336|pmid=27135317}}&lt;/ref&gt; enables experimentation with plant growth; acting as a miniature [[greenhouse]], scientists aboard the [[International Space Station]] can investigate how plants react in variable-gravity conditions.The Gravi-1 experiment (2008) utilized the EMCS to study [[lentil]] seedling growth and amyloplast movement on the calcium-dependent pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Driss-Ecole|first1=Dominique|last2=Legué|first2=Valérie|last3=Carnero-Diaz|first3=Eugénie|last4=Perbal|first4=Gérald|title=Gravisensitivity and automorphogenesis of lentil seedling roots grown on board the International Space Station|journal=Physiologia Plantarum|date=1 September 2008|volume=134|issue=1|pages=191–201|doi=10.1111/j.1399-3054.2008.01121.x|issn=1399-3054|pmid=18429941}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this experiment found that the plants were able to sense the direction of gravity even at very low levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific objectives|url=https://lensesinspace.wordpress.com/objectives-of-the-gravi-experiment-2/|website=Plants in space: GRAVI-2 experiment|date=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later experiment with the EMCS placed 768 lentil seedlings in a centrifuge to stimulate various gravitational changes; this experiment, Gravi-2 (2014), displayed that plants change calcium signalling towards root growth while being grown in a several gravity levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A decade of plant biology in space|url=https://phys.org/news/2016-07-decade-biology-space.html|publisher=European Space Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many experiments have a more generalized approach in observing overall plant growth patterns as opposed to one specific growth behavior. One such experiment from the [[Canadian Space Agency]], for example, found that [[white spruce]] seedlings grew differently in the anti-gravity space environment compared with Earth-bound seedlings;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA - Advanced Plant Experiment - Canadian Space Agency 2|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/70.html|website=www.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; the space seedlings exhibited enhanced growth from the shoots and needles, and also had randomized [[amyloplast]] distribution compared with the Earth-bound control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rioux|first1=Danny|last2=Lagacé|first2=Marie|last3=Cohen|first3=Luchino Y.|last4=Beaulieu|first4=Jean|title=Variation in stem morphology and movement of amyloplasts in white spruce grown in the weightless environment of the International Space Station|journal=Life Sciences in Space Research|date=1 January 2015|volume=4|pages=67–78|doi=10.1016/j.lssr.2015.01.004|pmid=26177622|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221455241500005X|bibcode=2015LSSR....4...67R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12558">'''Biocultural anthropology''' can be defined in numerous ways. It is the [[scientific]] exploration of the relationships between [[human biology]] and [[culture]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~kelso/Biologicalanth.html|title=Principles of Biocultural Anthropology|website=spot.colorado.edu|access-date=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Instead of looking for the biology underlying biological roots of human behavior, biocultural anthropology attempts to understand how culture affects our biological capacities and limitations."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
[[Biological anthropology|Physical anthropologists]] throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] perspective; that is, from the assumption that [[Typology (anthropology)|typological]] human biological differences lead to cultural differences.&lt;ref name="Biocult_syn"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Goodman |editor-first=Alan H. |editor2=Thomas L.

The shift towards understanding the role of culture to human biology led to the development of [[Dual inheritance theory]] in the 1960s. In relation to, and following the development of Dual-inheritance theory, [[biocultural evolution]] was introduced and first used in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bioculturalevolution.net/biocultural-overview/|title=Biocultural Evolution–An Overview|date=2013-05-22|newspaper=The Biocultural Evolution Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biocultural methods focus on the interactions between humans and their environment to understand human biological [[adaptation]] and [[Human genetic variation|variation]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0095.xml|title=Biocultural Anthropology - Anthropology - Oxford Bibliographies - obo|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary biocultural anthropologists view culture as having several key roles in human biological variation:
* Culture is a major human adaptation, permitting individuals and populations to adapt to widely varying local [[ecologies]].
* Characteristic human biological or biobehavioral features, such as a large [[frontal cortex]] and intensive [[parenting]] compared to other primates, are viewed in part as an [[adaptation]] to the complex social relations created by culture.&lt;ref name=Geary_Flinn&gt;{{cite journal

* Culture shapes the [[political economy]], thereby influencing what resources are available to individuals to feed and shelter themselves, protect themselves from disease, and otherwise maintain their health.&lt;ref name=Biocult_syn /&gt;
* Culture shapes the way people think about the world, altering their biology by influencing their behavior (e.g., food choice) or more directly through [[psychosomatic]] effects (e.g., the biological effects of [[Stress (medicine)|psychological stress]]).&lt;ref name=Hruschka_et_al&gt;{{cite journal

While biocultural anthropologists are found in many academic anthropology departments, usually as a minority of the faculty, certain departments have placed considerable emphasis on the "biocultural synthesis".  Historically, this has included [[Emory University]], the [[University of Alabama]], [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|UMass Amherst]] (especially in biocultural [[bioarchaeology]]) [http://www.umass.edu/bioarchaeology] [https://web.archive.org/web/20141030031504/http://www.umass.edu/anthro/faculty/permanent.html], and the [[University of Washington]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20090415073607/http://depts.washington.edu/anthweb/programs/biocultural.php], each of which built [[Ph.D.]] programs around biocultural anthropology; [[Binghamton University]], which has a [[Master of Science|M.S.]] program in biomedical anthropology; [[Oregon State University]], University of Kentucky and others. [[Paul T. Baker|Paul Baker]], an anthropologist at [[Penn State]] whose work focused upon human adaptation to environmental variations, is credited with having popularized the concept of "biocultural" anthropology as a distinct subcategory of [[anthropology]] in general.&lt;ref name=Bindon&gt;{{cite journal

== Controversy == 
{{unclear|section|date=February 2018}}
Other anthropologists, both [[biological anthropology|biological]] and [[cultural anthropology|cultural]], have criticized the biocultural synthesis, generally as part of a broader critique of "[[four-field holism]]" in U.S. anthropology (see [[anthropology]] main article).  Typically such criticisms rest on the belief that biocultural anthropology imposes holism upon the biological and cultural subfields without adding value, or even destructively.  For instance, contributors in the edited volume ''Unwrapping the Sacred Bundle: Reflections on the Disciplining of Anthropology''&lt;ref name=Sacred_bundle&gt;{{cite book |last=[http://pzacad.pitzer.edu/%7Edsegal/ Segal] |first=Daniel A. |editors=Sylvia J.

Some departments of anthropology have fully split, usually dividing [[scientific]] from humanistic anthropologists, such as [[Stanford|Stanford's]] highly publicized 1998 division into departments of "Cultural and Social Anthropology" and "Anthropological Sciences".  Underscoring the continuing controversy, this split is now being reversed over the objections of some faculty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2007/february14/anthsci-021407.html Anthropology departments instructed to form combined unit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Other departments, such as at [[Harvard]], have distinct biological and sociocultural anthropology "wings" not designed to foster cross subdisciplinary interchange.

Biocultural approaches were derived from [[biology]] and science yet social theorists {{who|date=February 2018}} are feeling encroached upon.{{weasel-inline|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; {{deadlink|date=February 2018}} The Biocultural approach has also not been a central concern to anthropologists {{dubious|date=February 2018}} which is a contributor to the splitting of the approach into [[sociocultural anthropology]] and biosocial anthropology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Biocult_syn" /&gt; Biocultural research has shown to contain a few challenges to the researcher.  "In general we are much more experienced in measuring the biological than the cultural. It is also difficult to precisely define what is meant by constructs such as socioeconomic status, poverty, rural, and urban. Operationalizing key variables so that they can be measured in ways that are enthnographically valid as well as replicable. Defining and measuring multiple causal pathways."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

However, the cleaner fish may sometimes cheat and consume mucus or tissue, thus creating a form of [[parasitism]].&lt;ref name=Gingins2013&gt;Gingins, S (2013) [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1761/20130553.full.pdf+html "Power and temptation cause shifts between exploitation and cooperation in a cleaner wrasse mutualism"], ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B'', '''280''' (1761): 20130553. {{doi|10.1098/rspb.2013.0553}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide variety of fish including [[wrasse]], [[cichlid]]s, [[catfish]], [[pipefish]], and [[goby|gobies]] display cleaning behaviors. Similar behavior is found in other groups of animals, such as [[cleaner shrimp]]s.

Cleaner fish advertise their services with [[animal coloration|conspicuous coloration]], often displaying a brilliant blue stripe that spans the length of the body. This adaptation has evolved independently in different species of cleaner fish, making it an example of [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, K.L., [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982209013037 "Blue and Yellow Signal Cleaning Behavior in Coral Reef Fishes"], "Current Biology", 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Other species of fish, called mimics, imitate the behavior and phenotype of cleaner fish to gain access to client fish tissue. This is another example of convergent evolution.&lt;ref name=Cheney2005&gt;Cheney, K.L. (2005) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1559983/ "Frequency-dependent success of aggressive mimics in a cleaning symbiosis"], ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B'', '''272''' (1581): 2635-2639.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diversity of cleaner fish==

===Marine fishes===
[[File:Arothron hispidus is being cleaned by Hawaiian cleaner wrasses, Labroides phthirophagus 1.jpg|thumb|A [[disruptive coloration|disruptively patterned]] [[white-spotted puffer]] being cleaned by a conspicuously coloured [[Hawaiian cleaner wrasse]]]]
[[File:Elacatinus evelynae.jpg|thumb|Caribbean cleaning goby ''[[Elacatinus evelynae]]'']]
[[File:Marine Iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) feeding underwater off Fernandina Island, Galápagos Islands.jpg|thumb|The cleaning recipient is typically another fish, but it can also involve other groups, like this [[Cortez rainbow wrasse]] cleaning a [[marine iguana]]]]

The best known cleaner fish are the [[bluestreak cleaner wrasse|cleaner wrasse]]s of the genus ''[[Labroides]]'' found on coral reefs in the [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]. These small fish maintain so-called [[cleaning stations]] where other fish, known as hosts, congregate and perform specific movements to attract the attention of the cleaner fish. Remarkably, these small cleaner fish safely clean large predatory fish that would otherwise eat small fish such as these.&lt;ref&gt;Helfman G., Collette B., &amp; Facey D.: The Diversity of Fishes, Blackwell Publishing, p 380, 1997, {{ISBN|0-86542-256-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While they derive the majority of their nutrients by removing ectoparasites, cleaner fish also feed on the mucus and tissue of the client fish, as these food sources have greater nutritional value. There is however a risk of terminating the cleaning interaction if the cleaner is too aggressive,  taking too much mucus and tissue. Because of this, cleaners seek a balance in feeding between ectoparasites and mucus or tissue.&lt;ref name=Gingins2013 /&gt;

Cleaning behaviors have been observed in a number of other fish groups. Neon [[Goby|gobies]] of the genera ''[[Gobiosoma]]'' and ''[[Elacatinus]]'' provide a cleaning service similar to the cleaner wrasses, though this time on reefs in the [[Atlantic Ocean|western Atlantic]], providing a good example of [[convergent evolution]]. Unlike the cleaner wrasses, they also eat a variety of small animals as well being cleaner fish, and generally do well in aquaria.&lt;ref name="fenner"&gt;Fenner, Robert M (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=9BA-PgAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22The+Conscientious+Marine+Aquarist%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ibeJUsXsDoPAkgW-mYCIBA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA ''The Conscientious Marine Aquarist''] TFH Publications, pp 282-283. {{ISBN|1-890087-02-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Caribbean cleaning goby]] (''Elacatinus evelynae'') gladly eat scales and mucus from the host when the ectoparasites it normally feeds on are scarce, making the relationship somewhat less than mutually beneficial. The [[symbiosis]] does not break down because the abundance of these parasites varies significantly seasonally and spatially, and the overall benefit to the larger fish outweighs any cheating on the part of the smaller.&lt;ref name = CheneyCote2005&gt;Cheney, K.L. and M. Côté (2005) [http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/2/162.full.pdf+html "Mutualism or parasitism? The variable outcome of cleaning symbioses"] ''Biology Letters'', '''1'''(2): 162-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brackish water fish===
An interesting example of a cleaning symbiosis has been observed between two [[brackish water]] [[Cichlidae|cichlids]] of the genus ''[[Etroplus]]'' from [[South Asia]]. The small species ''[[Etroplus maculatus]]'' is the cleaner fish, and the much larger ''[[Etroplus suratensis]]'' is the host that receives the cleaning service.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Wyman and Jack A. Ward (1972). A Cleaning Symbiosis between the Cichlid Fishes Etroplus maculatus and Etroplus suratensis. I. Description and Possible Evolution.

===Freshwater fish===
Cleaning has infrequently been observed in fresh waters compared to marine waters, but at least in part this is possibly related to fewer observers (such as divers) in the former habitat compared to the latter.&lt;ref name=Carvalho2007&gt;{{cite book | author1=Carvalho, L.N. | author2=J.

==Mimicry==

[[File:Plagiotremus rhinorhynchos (Blue-lined Sabertooth Blenny).jpg|thumb|right|The [[bluestriped fangblenny]] is an [[aggressive mimicry|aggressive mimic]] of the cleaner wrasse.]]

Mimic species have evolved body forms, patterns, and colors which imitate other species to gain a competitive advantage.&lt;ref name=Cheney2008&gt;Cheney, K.L. (2008) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17986437 "Facultative mimicry: cues for colour change and colour accuracy in a coral reef fish"], ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B'', ''' 275''' (1631): 117–122.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most studied examples of mimicry on coral reefs is the relationship between the [[aggressive mimicry|aggressive mimic]] ''Plagiotremus rhinorhynchos'' (the [[bluestriped fangblenny]]) and the cleaner wrasse model ''[[Labroides dimidiatus]]''. By appearing like ''L. dimidiatus'', ''P. rhinorhynchos'' is able to approach and subsequently feed on the tissue and scales of client fish while posing as a cleaner.&lt;ref name=Cheney2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cheney2012&gt;Cheney, K.L. (2012) [http://171.66.127.192/content/early/2011/08/16/rsbl.2011.0687.full.pdf+html "Cleaner wrasse mimics inflict higher costs on their models when they are more aggressive towards signal receivers"] ''Biology Letters'', {{doi|10.1098/rsbl.2011.0687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of the cleaner mimic, ''P. rhinorhynchos'', has a negative impact on the foraging success of the cleaner model ''L. dimidiatus''.&lt;ref name=Cheney2012 /&gt; ''P. rhinorhynchos'' feeds by eating the tissue and scales of client fish, making client fish much more cautious while at cleaning stations. More aggressive mimics have a greater negative impact on the foraging rate and success of the cleaner fish.&lt;ref name=Cheney2012 /&gt; When mimics appear in higher densities relative to cleaners, there is a significant decline in the success rate of the cleaner fish. The effects of the mimic/model ratio are susceptible to dilution, whereby an increase in client fish allows both the mimics and the models to have more access to clients, thus limiting the negative effects that mimics have on model foraging success.&lt;ref name=Cheney2005 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, K.L.

'''Community-supported agriculture''' ('''CSA model''') is a system that connects the producer and consumers within the [[Food systems|food system]] more closely by allowing the consumer to subscribe to the harvest of a certain farm or group of farms. It is an alternative socioeconomic model of [[agriculture]] and food distribution that allows the producer and consumer to share the risks of farming.&lt;ref name="Galt 341–365"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galt|first=Ryan E.|date=2013-10-01|title=The Moral Economy Is a Double-edged Sword: Explaining Farmers’ Earnings and Self-exploitation in Community-Supported Agriculture|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecge.12015/abstract|journal=Economic Geography|language=en|volume=89|issue=4|pages=341–365|doi=10.1111/ecge.12015|issn=1944-8287}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model is a subcategory of [[civic agriculture]] that has an overarching goal of strengthening a sense of [[community]] through local markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Obach|first=Brian K.|last2=Tobin|first2=Kathleen|date=2014-06-01|title=Civic agriculture and community engagement|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10460-013-9477-z|journal=Agriculture and Human Values|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=307–322|doi=10.1007/s10460-013-9477-z|issn=0889-048X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In return for subscribing to a harvest, subscribers receive either a weekly or bi-weekly box of produce or other farm goods. This includes in-season fruits and vegetables and can expand to dried goods, eggs, milk, meat, etc. Typically, farmers try to cultivate a relationship with subscribers by sending weekly letters of what is happening on the farm, inviting them for harvest, or holding an open-farm event. Some CSAs provide for contributions of labor in lieu of a portion of subscription costs.&lt;ref name="usda"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/afsic/pubs/csa/csadef.shtml | title=Defining Community Supported Agriculture | publisher=United States Department of Agriculture | date=September 1993 | accessdate=28 February 2015 | author=DeMuth, Suzanne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term CSA is mostly used in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], but a variety of similar production and economic sub-systems are in use worldwide.

==History==

The term "community-supported agriculture" was coined in the northeastern United States in the 1980s, influenced by European [[biodynamic agriculture]] ideas formulated by [[Rudolf Steiner]].&lt;ref name="McFadden"&gt;[http://www.newfarm.org/features/0104/csa-history/part1.shtml "History of Community Supported Agriculture, Part 1"] (2005), Rodale Institute, accessed 05-15-2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Two European farmers, Jan Vander Tuin from Switzerland and Trauger Groh from Germany, brought European biodynamic farming ideas to the United States in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="McFadden" /&gt; Vander Tuin had co-founded a community-supported agricultural project named Topinambur located near Zurich, Switzerland. Coinage of the term "community-supported agriculture" stems from Vander Tuin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/PDF/csa.pdf |title=Community Supported Agriculture |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This influence led to the separate and simultaneous creation of two CSAs in 1986. The CSA Garden at Great Barrington was created in Massachusetts by [[Jan Vander Tuin]], Susan Witt, and [[Robyn Van En]].  The Temple-Wilton Community Farm was created in New Hampshire by Anthony Graham, Trauger Groh, and Lincoln Geiger.&lt;ref name="McFadden" /&gt;
[[File:Mustard Seed Farms Oregon CSA.jpg|alt=Field of lettuce and other vegetables at Mustard Seed Farms, an organic CSA in Oregon|thumb|Mustard Seed Farms, an organic CSA farm in Oregon]]

The CSA Garden at Great Barrington remained together until 1990 when many members left to form the Mahaiwe Harvest CSA. One of the original founders, Robyn Van En, became incredibly influential in the CSA movement in America and founded [[CSA North America]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="McFadden" /&gt; The Temple-Wilton Community Garden was more successful and still operates as a CSA today. It became an important member of the Wilton community and it receives funding from state, federal, and local sources.&lt;ref name="McFadden" /&gt;

A parallel model called [[Teikei]] existed in Japan as early as the mid 1960s. Similarly, Dr. [[Booker T. Whatley]], a professor of agriculture in Alabama, advocated for Clientele Membership Clubs as early as the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.motherearthnews.com/organic-gardening/csas-rooted-in-black-history-zbcz1502.aspx | publisher = motherearthnews.com | title = CSAs Rooted in Black History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, community supported farms have been organized throughout North America — mainly in New England, the Northwest, the Pacific coast, the Upper-Midwest and [[Canada]]. [[North America]] now has at least 13,000 CSA farms of which 12,549 are in the US according to the US Department of Agriculture in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2007/Full_Report/Volume_1,_Chapter_2_US_State_Level/st99_2_044_044.pdf |title=USDA 2007 Agricultural Census Table 44 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of CSAs seems to be correlated with the increase in awareness of the [[environmental movement in the United States]]. Some examples of larger and well established CSAs in the US are [[Angelic Organics]], Golden Earthworm Organic Farm &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.honeybrookorganicfarm.com/index.html Honeybrook Organic Farm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523190211/http://honeybrookorganicfarm.com/index.html |date=2010-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phillies Bridge Farm]], and Roxbury Farm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roxburyfarm.com/ Roxbury farm.com] Roxbury Farm&lt;/ref&gt;  CSAs have even become popular in urban environments as proven by the [[New York City Coalition Against Hunger (NYCCAH)|New York City Coalition Against Hunger]]'s own CSA program that maintains locations in all five boroughs of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyccah.org/our-work/direct-food-access/farm-fresh/farm-fresh-project Farm-fresh project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503222324/http://www.nyccah.org/our-work/direct-food-access/farm-fresh/farm-fresh-project |date=May 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest subscription CSA with over 13,000 families is Farm Fresh To You in [[Capay Valley]], California.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Anderson (22 August 2010). [http://bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2010/08/23/story3.html Capay farm, distributor buys West Sac warehouse.] ''Sacramento Business Journal''&lt;/ref&gt; The Québec CSA network (17 years old in 2012) is one of the larger in the world. It is a unique system where a non-profit organization reach the customers for the farmers and provide these farmers with technical support. More than one hundred farms are part of this network.  Some CSAs are used by farmers, such as [[Sugar Mountain Farm]] in Vermont, to finance improvements and new infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.uvm.edu/newfarmer/business/finance-guide/Farm-Case-Studies.pdf |chapter=Chapter 8: The “Multi-Year CSA” Financing Model Farm Case Study: Sugar Mountain Farm, West Topsham, Vt.  |title=The Guide to Financing the Community Supported Farm-Ways for Farms to Acquire Capital from Communities |publisher=University of Vermont Extension-UVM Center for Sustainable Agriculture |accessdate=2015-05-05 |year=2012 |pages=43–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, the international CSA network Urgenci has been coordinating dissemination and exchange programmes that have resulted in the creation of dozens of small-scale CSA in Central and Eastern Europe.

== Socio-economic model ==
CSAs create direct connections between producers and consumers through [[alternative markets]] and the members and farmers share the risk of farming.&lt;ref name="Galt 341–365"/&gt;  The goals of the first CSA model in the US were to have the producer and consumer to come into the market as equals and make an exchange with fair prices and fair wages.&lt;ref name="Galt 341–365"/&gt;

The consumer pays for things such as transparency, environmental stewardship, producer relationships, etc. The farmers engaged in CSAs do so to fulfill goals other than income and are not compensated fairly in these exchanges.&lt;ref name="Galt 341–365"/&gt; This kind of market holds ‘economic rents’ where the consumer surplus comes from the consumers’ willingness to pay for something further than the product as well as for the products inputs themselves.&lt;ref name="Galt 341–365"/&gt; Although these markets still exist within a larger capitalist economy, they are able to exist because of the ‘economic rents’ that are collected.

==CSA system==
CSAs generally focus on the production of high quality foods for a local community, often using [[Organic farming|organic]] or [[biodynamic agriculture|biodynamic farming]] methods, and a shared risk membership–marketing structure. This kind of farming operates with a much greater degree of involvement of consumers and other stakeholders than usual — resulting in a stronger consumer-producer relationship.&lt;ref name="csa21"&gt;{{cite book|author=Committee on Twenty-First Century Systems Agriculture, Board on Agriculture and Natural Resources, Division on Earth and Life Sciences |title=Toward Sustainable Agricultural Systems in the 21st Century|year=2010|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9780309148962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wdm4qMW1azgC&amp;lpg=PT227&amp;dq=CSA%20consumer%20farmer%20relationship&amp;pg=PT227#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core design includes developing a cohesive consumer group that is willing to fund a whole season's budget in order to get quality foods. The system has many variations on how the farm budget is supported by the consumers and how the producers then deliver the foods. CSA theory purports that the more a farm embraces whole-farm, whole-budget support, the more it can focus on quality and reduce the risk of food waste.

===Structure===
Community-supported agriculture farms in the United States today share three common characteristics: an emphasis on community and/or local produce, share or subscriptions sold prior to season, and weekly deliveries to members/subscribers. Though CSA operation varies from farm to farm and has evolved over time, these three characteristics have remained constant.&lt;ref name="2009survey"&gt;[http://api.ning.com/files/3FyohVhrK-m5eIn2G2jfkF2vpDUXaYlfQtSpRUvy4u2WE1tMaovZ673Tnfo*fd8T3ysBa9ncJb4Z81pTNEIQUaoTvYJIe6Qs/NESAWGCSA2001.pdf 2009 Survey of Community Supported Agriculture Producers], University of Kentucky, accessed 05-15-2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The functioning of a CSA also relies on four practical arrangements: for farmers to know the needs of a community, for consumers to have the opportunity to express to farmers what their needs and financial limitations are, for commitments between farmers and consumers to be consciously established, and for farmers needs to be recognized.&lt;ref name="Lamb"&gt;[http://www.thecenterforsocialresearch.org/sites/default/files/assests/csr/about/csa.pdf "Community Supported Agriculture"]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, The Center for Social Research. Accessed 05-15-2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

From this base, four main types of CSAs have been developed:

* Farmer managed: A farmer sets up and maintains a CSA, recruits subscribers, and controls management of the CSA.
* Shareholder/subscriber: Local residents set up a CSA and hire a farmer to grow crops, and shareholders/subscribers control most management.
* Farmer cooperative: Multiple farmers develop a CSA program.
* Farmer-shareholder cooperative: Farmers and local residents set up and cooperatively manage a CSA.&lt;ref name="CSA"&gt;[http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/rbs/CDP-TN20.PDF "Community Supported Agriculture"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823234251/http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/rbs/CDP-TN20.PDF |date=2012-08-23 }}, Technotes: Office of Community Development, US Department of Agriculture, accessed 05-15-2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most original CSAs, a core group of members existed.  This core group of members helped to make decisions about and run the CSA including marketing, distribution, administrative, and community organization functions.  CSAs with a core group of members are most profitable and successful.  However, in 1999, 72 percent of CSAs did not have a core group of members.  CSAs with a core group of members operate more successfully as a farmer-shareholder cooperative and CSAs without a group of core members rely much more on subscriptions and run most prominently as shareholder/subscriber CSAs.&lt;ref name="survey1999"&gt;[http://www.cias.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/csaacross.pdf] "CSA Across the Nation" Center for Integrated Agricultural Services. Accessed 05-22-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ideology===

Community-supported agriculture in America was influenced by the ideas of [[Rudolf Steiner]], an Austrian philosopher. He developed the concepts of [[anthroposophy]] and [[biodynamic agriculture]]. The Temple-Wilton Community Farm used his ideas to develop three main goals of CSAs:

* New forms of property ownership: the idea that land should be held in common by a community through a legal trust, which leases the land to farmers
* New forms of cooperation: the idea that a network of human relationships should replace the traditional system of employers and employees
* New forms of economy: that the economy should not be based on increasing profit, but should be based on the actual needs of the people and land involved in an enterprise&lt;ref name="McFadden" /&gt;

As CSAs have increased in both number and size since they were first developed, they have also changed ideologically.  While original CSAs and some more current CSAs are still philosophically oriented, most CSAs today are commercially oriented and community-supported agriculture is predominantly seen as a beneficial marketing strategy.&lt;ref name="McFadden" /&gt; This has led to three ideologically based types of CSAs.  The first type is instrumental, the CSA is considered a market in the traditional sense, instead of an alternative form of economy and relationship. The second type is functional; there is a relationship of solidarity between the farmer and the subscribers, but this extends mostly to social functions, not managerial or administrative functions. This is the most common type of CSA.  The final type is collaborative; this is the closest to the original aims of CSAs where the relationship between the farmer and the subscribers is seen as a partnership.&lt;ref name="Devon"&gt;[https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10460-008-9154-9.pdf "Devon Acres CSA: local struggles in a global food system"] (2008), retrieved 04-11-2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution and marketing methods===

Shares of a CSA originally and predominantly consist of produce. In more recent years, shares have diversified and include non-produce products including eggs, meat, flowers, honey, dairy and soaps.&lt;ref name="2009survey" /&gt;  Share prices vary from CSA to CSA.  Shares are sold as full shares, which feed 2 to 5 people, and half shares, which feed 1 to 3 people.  Prices range from $200 to $500 per season.  Full shares are sold at a median of $400 and half shares are sold at a median of $250.&lt;ref name="2001summary"&gt;[http://www.cias.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/csa_survey_01.pdf]"Community Supported Agriculture Entering the 21st Century". Accessed 23 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Share prices are mostly determined by overhead costs of production, but are also determined by share prices of other CSAs, variable costs of production, market forces, and income level of the community.&lt;ref name="2009survey" /&gt; Many CSAs have payment plans and low-income options.

Shares are distributed in several different ways.  Shares are most often distributed weekly. Most CSAs allow share pick up at the farm.  Shares are also distributed through regional dropoff, direct home or office dropoff, farmers' markets, and community center/church dropoff.&lt;ref name="2009survey" /&gt; For example, the new "Farmie Markets" of upstate New York&lt;ref name="farmies"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hudsonvalley.farmiemarket.com/ | title=Farmie Markets of Upstate NY | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131110210351/http://hudsonvalley.farmiemarket.com/ | archivedate=2013-11-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; take orders online and have a number of farmers who send that week's orders to a central point in a limited region, for distribution by the organizers.

CSAs market their farms and shares in different ways.  CSAs employ different channels of marketing to diversify their sales efforts and increase subscriptions.  CSAs use local farmers' markets, restaurants, on-farm retail, wholesale to natural food stores, and wholesale to local groceries in addition to their CSAs to market shares. One problem that CSAs encounter is over-production, so CSAs often sell their produce and products in ways other than shares. Often, CSA farms also sell their products at local farmers' markets. Excess products are sometimes given to foods banks.&lt;ref name="2009survey" /&gt;

=== Challenges for farmers ===
Many CSA farmers can capitalize on a closer relationship between customers and their food, since some customers will pay more if they know where it is coming from, who is involved, and have special access to it; for more information, see [[economic rent]].&lt;ref name="Galt 341–365"/&gt; However, some farmers participating in community-supported agriculture do not experience the economic benefits that they are perceived to obtain by participating in an alternative community-based arrangement. Galt's 2013 study of CSA farmers found that many farmers exploited themselves, charging lower fees and prices for their goods than would provide them with financial security.&lt;ref name="Galt 341–365"/&gt; This study suggested that farmers may charge less than they need to earn fair wages due to undervaluing their expenses and to offset the high costs of CSA products and make it more affordable for customers; see [[moral economy]].&lt;ref name="Galt 341–365"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28630">'''Computational electromagnetics''', '''computational electrodynamics''' or '''electromagnetic modeling''' is the process of modeling the interaction of [[electromagnetic field]]s with physical objects and the environment.

It typically involves using computationally efficient approximations to [[Maxwell's equations]] and is used to calculate [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] performance, [[electromagnetic compatibility]], [[radar cross section]] and electromagnetic [[wave propagation]] when not in free space.

A specific part of computational electromagnetics deals with [[electromagnetic radiation]] [[light scattering by particles|scattered and absorbed by small particles]].

==Background==
&lt;!-- ''Why do electromagnetic modeling?   is being modeled?  What are the computational issues?''  {{Expand section|date=October 2008}} --&gt;
Several real-world electromagnetic problems like [[Scattering#Electromagnetic scattering|electromagnetic scattering]], [[electromagnetic radiation]], modeling of [[waveguide]]s etc., are
not analytically calculable, for the multitude of irregular geometries found in actual devices. Computational numerical techniques can overcome the inability to derive closed form solutions of Maxwell's equations under various [[constitutive relation]]s of media, and [[boundary condition]]s. This makes ''computational electromagnetics'' (CEM) important to the design, and modeling of antenna, radar, [[communication satellite|satellite]] and other communication systems, [[nanophotonic]] devices and high speed [[silicon]] electronics, [[medical imaging]], cell-phone antenna design, among other applications.

CEM typically solves the problem of computing the ''E'' (electric) and ''H'' (magnetic) fields across the problem domain (e.g., to calculate antenna [[radiation pattern]] for an arbitrarily shaped antenna structure). Also calculating power flow direction ([[Poynting vector]]), a waveguide's [[normal mode]]s, media-generated wave dispersion, and scattering can be computed from the ''E'' and ''H'' fields. CEM models may or may not assume [[symmetry]], simplifying real world structures to idealized [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]s, [[sphere]]s, and other regular geometrical objects. CEM models extensively make use of symmetry, and solve for reduced dimensionality from 3 spatial dimensions to 2D and even 1D.

An [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|eigenvalue]] problem formulation of CEM allows us to calculate steady state normal modes in a structure. [[Transient response]] and impulse field effects are more accurately modeled by CEM in time domain, by [[FDTD]]. Curved geometrical objects are treated more accurately as finite elements [[Finite element method|FEM]], or non-orthogonal grids. [[Beam propagation method]] (BPM) can solve for the power flow in waveguides. CEM is application specific, even if different techniques converge to the same field and power distributions in the modeled domain.

==Overview of methods==
One approach is to discretize the space in terms of grids (both orthogonal, and non-orthogonal) and solving Maxwell's equations at each point in the grid. Discretization consumes computer memory, and solving the equations takes significant time. Large-scale CEM problems face memory and CPU limitations. As of 2007, CEM problems require supercomputers,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} high performance clusters,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} vector processors and/or [[parallel computer|parallelism]]. Typical formulations involve either time-stepping through the equations over the whole domain for each time instant; or through banded [[matrix inversion]] to calculate the weights of basis functions, when modeled by finite element methods; or matrix products when using transfer matrix methods; or calculating [[integral]]s when using [[Boundary element method|method of moments]] (MoM); or using [[fast fourier transform]]s, and time iterations when calculating by the split-step method or by BPM.

==Choice of methods==
Choosing the right technique for solving a problem is important, as choosing the wrong one can either result in incorrect results, or results which take excessively long to compute. However, the name of a technique does not always tell one how it is implemented, especially for commercial tools, which will often have more than one solver.

Davidson&lt;ref name="davidson" /&gt; gives two tables comparing the FEM, MoM and FDTD techniques in the way they are normally implemented. One table is for both open region (radiation and scattering problems) and another table is for guided wave problems.

==Maxwell's equations in hyperbolic PDE form==
Maxwell's equations can be formulated as a [[hyperbolic system]] of [[partial differential equation]]s.  This gives access to powerful techniques for numerical solutions.

It is assumed that the waves propagate in the (''x'',''y'')-plane and restrict the direction of the magnetic field to be parallel to the ''z''-axis and thus the electric field to be parallel to the (''x'',''y'') plane. The wave is called a transverse magnetic (TM) wave.  In 2D and no polarization terms present, Maxwell's equations can then be formulated as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\bar{u} + A\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\bar{u} + B\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\bar{u} +C\bar{u} = \bar{g}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''u'', ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{u}=\left(\begin{matrix} E_x \\ E_y \\ H_z \end{matrix}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A=\left(\begin{matrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{1}{\epsilon} \\ 0 &amp; \frac{1}{\mu} &amp; 0 \end{matrix}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B=\left(\begin{matrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{-1}{\epsilon} \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ \frac{-1}{\mu} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{matrix}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C=\left(\begin{matrix} \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon} &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{matrix}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

In this representation, &lt;math&gt;\bar{g}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[forcing function (differential equations)|forcing function]], and is in the same space as &lt;math&gt;\bar{u}&lt;/math&gt;.  It can be used to express an externally applied field or to describe an optimization [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]].  As formulated above:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{g}=\left(\begin{matrix} E_{x, constraint} \\ E_{y, constraint} \\ H_{z, constraint} \end{matrix}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\bar{g}&lt;/math&gt; may also be explicitly defined equal to zero to simplify certain problems, or to find a [[Generalized eigenvector|characteristic solution]], which is often the first step in a method to find the particular inhomogeneous solution.

==Integral equation solvers==

===The discrete dipole approximation===
The [[discrete dipole approximation]] is a flexible technique for computing scattering and absorption by targets of arbitrary [[geometry]]. The formulation is based on integral form of Maxwell equations. The DDA is an approximation of the continuum target by a finite array of polarizable points. The points acquire [[Magnetic moment|dipole moment]]s in response to the local electric field. The dipoles of course interact with one another via their electric fields, so the DDA is also sometimes referred to as the coupled [[dipole]] approximation. The resulting linear system of equations is commonly solved using [[conjugate gradient]] iterations. The discretization matrix has symmetries (the integral form of Maxwell equations has form of convolution) enabling [[Fast Fourier Transform]] to multiply matrix times vector during conjugate gradient iterations.

===Method of moments element method ===
The method of moments (MoM)&lt;ref&gt;Roger F. Harrington (1968). Field Computation by Moment Methods. Latest printing by IEEE Press in 1993, {{ISBN|0780310144}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[boundary element method]] (BEM) is a numerical computational method of solving linear partial differential equations which have been formulated as [[integral equation]]s (i.e. in ''boundary integral'' form). It can be applied in many areas of engineering and science including [[fluid mechanics]], [[acoustics]], [[electromagnetics]], [[fracture mechanics]], and [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]].

MoM has become more popular since the 1980s. Because it requires calculating only boundary values, rather than values throughout the space, it is significantly more efficient in terms of computational resources for problems with a small surface/volume ratio. Conceptually, it works by constructing a "mesh" over the modeled surface.  However, for many problems, BEM are significantly computationally less efficient than volume-discretization methods ([[finite element method]], [[finite difference method]], [[finite volume method]]).  Boundary element formulations typically give rise to fully populated matrices. This means that the storage requirements and computational time will tend to grow according to the square of the problem size.  By contrast, finite element matrices are typically banded (elements are only locally connected) and the storage requirements for the system matrices typically grow linearly with the problem size.  Compression techniques (''e.g.'' multipole expansions or adaptive cross approximation/hierarchical matrices) can be used to ameliorate these problems, though at the cost of added complexity and with a success-rate that depends heavily on the nature and geometry of the problem.

BEM is applicable to problems for which [[Green's function]]s can be calculated.  These usually involve fields in [[linear]] [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] media.  This places considerable restrictions on the range and generality of problems suitable for boundary elements.  Nonlinearities can be included in the formulation, although they generally introduce volume integrals which require the volume to be discretized before solution, removing an oft-cited advantage of BEM.

===Fast multipole method ===
The [[fast multipole method]] (FMM) is an alternative to MoM or Ewald summation. It is an accurate simulation technique and requires less memory and processor power than MoM. The FMM was first introduced by [[Leslie Greengard|Greengard]] and [[Vladimir Rokhlin (American scientist)|Rokhlin]]&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Greengard and Vladimir Rokhlin (1987). "A Fast Algorithm for Particle Simulations." J. Computational Physics Vol. 73, No. 2, pp 325-348.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Rokhlin (1985). "Rapid Solution of Integral Equations of Classic Potential Theory." J. Computational Physics Vol. 60, pp. 187-207.&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on the [[multipole expansion]] technique. The first application of the FMM in computational electromagnetics was by Engheta et al.(1992).&lt;ref&gt;Nader Engheta, William D. Murphy, Vladimir Rokhlin, and Marius Vassiliou (1992), "The Fast Multipole Method for Electromagnetic Scattering Computation," IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation 40, 634-641.&lt;/ref&gt;  FMM can also be used to accelerate MoM.

===Plane wave time-domain ===
While the fast multipole method is useful for accelerating MoM solutions of integral equations with static or frequency-domain oscillatory kernels, the '''plane wave time-domain (PWTD)''' algorithm employs similar ideas to accelerate the MoM solution of time-domain integral equations involving the [[retarded potential]]. The PWTD algorithm was introduced in 1998 by Ergin, Shanker, and Michielssen.&lt;ref&gt;Ergin, A. A., Shanker, B., &amp; Michielssen, E. (1998). Fast evaluation of three-dimensional transient wave fields using diagonal translation operators. Journal of Computational Physics, 146(1), 157-180.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partial element equivalent circuit method===
The [[partial element equivalent circuit]] (PEEC) is a 3D full-wave modeling method suitable for combined [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] and [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] analysis. Unlike MoM, PEEC is a full [[spectrum]] method valid from [[Direct current|dc]] to the maximum [[frequency]] determined by the meshing. In the PEEC method, the [[integral equation]] is interpreted as [[Kirchhoff's voltage law]] applied to a basic PEEC cell which results in a complete circuit solution for 3D geometries. The equivalent circuit formulation allows for additional [[SPICE]] type circuit elements to be easily included. Further, the models and the analysis apply to both the time and the frequency domains. The circuit equations resulting from the PEEC model are easily constructed using a modified [[loop analysis]] (MLA) or [[modified nodal analysis]] (MNA) formulation. Besides providing a direct current solution, it has several other advantages over a MoM analysis for this class of problems since any type of circuit element can be included in a straightforward way with appropriate matrix stamps. The PEEC method has recently been extended to include nonorthogonal geometries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1200853 A. E. Ruehli, G. Antonini, J. Esch, J. Ekman, A. Mayo, A. Orlandi, "Nonorthogonal PEEC formulation for time- and frequency-domain EM and circuit modeling," IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility, vol. 45, no. 2, pp. 167–176, May 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt; This model extension, which is consistent with the classical [[orthogonal]] formulation, includes the Manhattan representation of the geometries in addition to the more general [[quadrilateral]] and [[hexahedral]] elements. This helps in keeping the number of unknowns at a minimum and thus reduces computational time for nonorthogonal geometries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sm.luth.se/~jekman/PEEC/Program/ Partial Element Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differential equation solvers==

===Finite-difference time-domain ===
[[Finite-difference time-domain]] (FDTD) is a popular CEM technique. It is easy to understand. It has an exceptionally simple implementation for a full wave solver. It is at least an order of magnitude less work to implement a basic FDTD solver than either an FEM or MoM solver. FDTD is the only technique where one person can realistically implement oneself in a reasonable time frame, but even then, this will be for a quite specific problem.&lt;ref name="davidson"&gt;David B. Davidson, ''Computational Electromagnetics for RF and Microwave Engineering'', Second Edition, Cambridge University Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is a time-domain method, solutions can cover a wide frequency range with a single simulation run, provided the time step is small enough to satisfy the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]] for the desired highest frequency.

FDTD belongs in the general class of grid-based differential time-domain numerical modeling methods. [[Maxwell's equations]] (in [[Partial differential equation|partial differential]] form) are modified to central-difference equations, discretized, and implemented in software. The equations are solved in a cyclic manner:  the [[electric field]] is solved at a given instant in time, then the [[magnetic field]] is solved at the next instant in time, and the process is repeated over and over again.

The basic FDTD algorithm traces back to a seminal 1966 paper by Kane Yee in [[IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation]]. [[Allen Taflove]] originated the descriptor "Finite-difference time-domain" and its corresponding "FDTD" acronym in a 1980 paper in IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility. Since about 1990, FDTD techniques have emerged as the primary means to model many scientific and engineering problems addressing electromagnetic wave interactions with material structures. An effective technique based on a time-domain finite-volume discretization procedure was introduced by Mohammadian et al. in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Alireza H. Mohammadian, Vijaya Shankar, and William F. Hall (1991). "Computation of Electromagnetic Scattering and Radiation Using a Time-Domain Finite-Volume Discretization Procedure. Computer Physics Communications Vol. 68, No. 1, 175-196.&lt;/ref&gt;  Current FDTD modeling applications range from near-DC (ultralow-frequency geophysics involving the entire Earth-[[ionosphere]] waveguide) through [[microwave]]s (radar signature technology, antennas, wireless communications devices, digital interconnects, biomedical imaging/treatment) to visible light ([[photonic crystal]]s, nanoplasmonics, [[soliton]]s, and [[biophotonics]]).  Approximately 30 commercial and university-developed software suites are available.

===Multiresolution time-domain===
MRTD is an adaptive alternative to the finite difference time domain method (FDTD) based on [[wavelet]] analysis.

===Finite element method ===
The [[finite element method]] (FEM) is used to find approximate solution of [[partial differential equation]]s (PDE) and [[integral equation]]s.  The solution approach is based either on eliminating the time derivatives completely (steady state problems), or rendering the PDE into an equivalent [[ordinary differential equation]], which is then solved using standard techniques such as [[finite difference]]s, etc.

In solving [[partial differential equation]]s, the primary challenge is to create an equation which approximates the equation to be studied, but which is [[numerically stable]], meaning that errors in the input data and intermediate calculations do not accumulate and destroy the meaning of the resulting output. There are many ways of doing this, with various advantages and disadvantages. The finite element method is a good choice for solving partial differential equations over complex domains or when the desired precision varies over the entire domain.

===Finite integration technique ===
The finite integration technique (FIT) is a spatial discretization scheme to numerically solve electromagnetic field problems in time and frequency domain. It preserves basic [[topological]] properties of the continuous equations such as conservation of charge and energy. FIT was proposed in 1977 by [[w:de:Thomas Weiland|Thomas Weiland]] and has been enhanced continually over the years.&lt;ref&gt;
T. Weiland, A Discretization Method for the Solution of Maxwell's Equations for Six-Component Fields, Electronics and Communications AEUE, vol. 31, no. 3, pp. 116–120, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; This method covers the full range of electromagnetics (from static up to high frequency) and optic applications and is the basis for commercial simulation tools.&lt;ref&gt;
CST Studio Suite developed by [[Computer Simulation Technology]] (CST AG).&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;
Electromagnetic Simulation solutions developed by [[Nimbic]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2013}}

The basic idea of this approach is to apply the Maxwell equations in integral form to a set of staggered grids. This method stands out due to high flexibility in geometric modeling and boundary handling as well as incorporation of arbitrary material distributions and material properties such as [[anisotropy]], non-linearity and dispersion. Furthermore, the use of a consistent dual orthogonal grid (e.g. [[Cartesian grid]]) in conjunction with an explicit time integration scheme (e.g. leap-frog-scheme) leads to compute and memory-efficient algorithms, which are especially adapted for transient field analysis in [[radio frequency]] (RF) applications.

===Pseudo-spectral time domain ===
This class of marching-in-time computational techniques for Maxwell's equations uses either discrete Fourier or [[discrete Chebyshev transform]]s to calculate the spatial derivatives of the electric and magnetic field vector components that are arranged in either a 2-D grid or 3-D lattice of unit cells. PSTD causes negligible numerical phase velocity anisotropy errors relative to FDTD, and therefore allows problems of much greater electrical size to be modeled.&lt;ref&gt;
For a recent comprehensive summary of PSTD techniques for Maxwell's equations, see Q. Liu and G. Zhao "Advances in PSTD Techniques," Chapter 17 in Computational Electrodynamics: The Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method, A. Taflove and S. C. Hagness, eds., Boston: [[Artech House]], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pseudo-spectral spatial domain ===
PSSD solves Maxwell's equations by propagating them forward in a chosen spatial direction. The fields are therefore held as a function of time, and (possibly) any transverse spatial dimensions. The method is pseudo-spectral because temporal derivatives are calculated in the frequency domain with the aid of FFTs. Because the fields are held as functions of time, this enables arbitrary dispersion in the propagation medium to be rapidly and accurately modelled with minimal effort.&lt;ref&gt;
J.C.A. Tyrrell et al., [[Journal of Modern Optics]] 52, 973 (2005); {{doi|10.1080/09500340512331334086}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the choice to propagate forward in space (rather than in time) brings with it some subtleties, particularly if reflections are important.&lt;ref&gt;P. Kinsler, [[Phys. Rev. A]]81, 013819 (2010); {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevA.81.013819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmission line matrix ===
[[Transmission line matrix method|Transmission line matrix]] (TLM) can be formulated in several means as a direct set of lumped elements solvable directly by a circuit solver (ala SPICE, [[HSPICE]], et al.), as a custom network of elements or via a [[scattering matrix]] approach.  TLM is a very flexible analysis strategy akin to FDTD in capabilities, though more codes tend to be available with FDTD engines.

===Locally one-dimensional  ===

This is an implicit method. In this method, in two-dimensional case, Maxwell equations  are computed in two steps, whereas in three-dimensional case Maxwell equations are divided into three spatial coordinate directions. Stability and dispersion analysis of the three-dimensional LOD-FDTD method have been discussed in detail.&lt;ref&gt;I.Ahmed, E.K.Chua, E.P.Li, Z.Chen., [[IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation]] 56, 3596-3600 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I.Ahmed, E.K.Chua, E.P.Li., [[IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation]] 58, 3983-3989 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other methods==

===EigenMode expansion ===
[[Eigenmode expansion]] (EME) is a rigorous bi-directional technique to simulate electromagnetic propagation which relies on the decomposition of the electromagnetic fields into a basis set of local eigenmodes. The eigenmodes are found by solving Maxwell's equations in each local cross-section. Eigenmode expansion can solve Maxwell's equations in 2D and 3D and can provide a fully vectorial solution provided that the mode solvers are vectorial. It offers very strong benefits compared with the FDTD method for the modelling of optical waveguides, and it is a popular tool for the modelling of [[fiber optics]] and [[silicon photonics]] devices.

===Physical optics ===
[[Physical optics]] (PO) is the name of a [[high frequency approximation]] (short-[[wavelength]] [[approximation]]) commonly used in optics, [[electrical engineering]] and [[applied physics]].  It is an intermediate method between geometric optics, which ignores [[wave]] effects, and full wave [[electromagnetism]], which is a precise [[theory]]. The word "physical" means that it is more physical than [[geometrical optics]] and not that it is an exact physical theory.

The approximation consists of using ray optics to estimate the field on a surface and then [[integral|integrating]] that field over the surface to calculate the transmitted or scattered field. This resembles the [[Born approximation]], in that the details of the problem are treated as a [[perturbation theory|perturbation]].

===Uniform theory of diffraction ===
The [[uniform theory of diffraction]] (UTD) is a [[high frequency]] method for solving [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] [[scattering]] problems from electrically small discontinuities or discontinuities in more than one dimension at the same point.

The [[uniform theory of diffraction]] approximates [[near and far field|near field]] electromagnetic fields as quasi optical and uses ray diffraction to determine diffraction coefficients for each diffracting object-source combination. These coefficients are then used to calculate the field strength and [[phase (waves)|phase]] for each direction away from the diffracting point. These fields are then added to the incident fields and reflected fields to obtain a total solution.

==Validation==
Validation is one of the key issues facing electromagnetic simulation users. The user must understand and master the validity domain of its simulation. The measure is, "how far from the reality are the results?"

Answering  this question involves three steps: comparison between simulation results and analytical formulation, cross-comparison between codes, and comparison of simulation results with measurement.

===Comparison between simulation results and analytical formulation===
For example, assessing the value of the [[radar cross section]] of a plate with the analytical formula:

:: &lt;math&gt;\text{RCS}_\text{Plate} = \frac{4 \pi A^2}{\lambda^2},&lt;/math&gt;

: where '''A''' is the surface of the plate and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength. The next curve presenting the RCS of a plate computed at 35 [[GHz]] can be used as reference example.

===Cross-comparison between codes===
One example is the cross comparison of results from method of moments and asymptotic methods in their validity domains.&lt;ref&gt;
As an illustration, the company [http://www.oktal-se.fr/ OKTAL-SE] made common development and cross comparison with the French research institute [http://www.onera.fr/ ONERA], comparing Method of Moment and Asymptotic methods. The cross comparison helped the validation process of the SE-RAY-EM code of OKTAL-SE. [http://www.oktal-se.fr/website/external/rcs_plate_35ghz.jpg Illustration]{{dead link|date=February 2017}} of the comparison between the SE-RAY-EM code and the ONERA reference code (right image).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison of simulation results with measurement===
The final validation step is made by comparison between measurements and simulation. For example, the RCS calculation&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.oktal-se.fr/ SE-RAY-EM]&lt;/ref&gt; and the measurement&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.fgan.de/ FGAN-FHR]&lt;/ref&gt; of a complex metallic object at 35&amp;nbsp;GHz. The computation implements GO, PO and PTD for the edges.

Validation processes can clearly reveal that  some differences can be explained by the differences between the experimental setup and its reproduction in the simulation environment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013230028/http://www.oktal-se.fr/website/news/pdf/RCS_35GHz_March2007.pdf full article]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Light scattering codes==
There are now many efficient codes for solving electromagnetic scattering problems. They are listed as [[discrete dipole approximation codes]], [[codes for electromagnetic scattering by cylinders]], [[codes for electromagnetic scattering by spheres]]. Solutions which are analytical, such as Mie solution for scattering by spheres or cylinders, can be used to validate more involved techniques.

The '''[[Direct current|DC]] distribution system''' has been proposed, as a replacement for the present [[Alternating current|AC]] power distribution system for ships with electric propulsion.

This concept represents a new way of distributing energy for low-voltage installations on ships. It can be used for any electrical ship application up to 20 megawatts and operates at a nominal voltage of 1000V DC. The DC distribution system is simply an extension of the multiple DC links that already exist in all propulsion and thruster drives, which usually account for more than 80 percent of the electrical power consumption on electric propulsion vessels.

==Benefits==
In addition to boosting efficiency by up to 20 percent, other benefits include space and weight savings of up to 30 percent and flexible placement of electrical equipment.&lt;ref name=20plus&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for significantly more cargo space and a more functional vessel layout where the electrical system is designed around the vessel functions and not vice versa.

The efficiency improvement is mainly achieved from the system no longer being locked at a specific frequency (usually 60&amp;nbsp;Hz on ships), even though a 60&amp;nbsp;Hz power source can also be connected to the grid. This new freedom of being able to control each power source totally independently opens up numerous ways of optimizing fuel consumption.
 
The reduced weight and footprint of the installed electrical equipment will vary depending on the ship type and application. One comparison using the DC distribution system instead of the traditional AC system for a Platform Supply Vessel (PSV), reduced the weight of the electrical system components from {{Convert|115520|kg|lbs}} to {{convert|85360|kg|lbs}}.

On land, the [[solar panel]]s on several buildings in Sweden are connected via DC to smooth production and consumption, bypassing the AC grid and its inverters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/likstrom-vaxlar-upp-ett-steg-till-6846362 |title=Likström växlar upp ett steg till|publisher=[[Ny Teknik]] |accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fuel savings==
The biggest potential for fuel savings lies in the ease with which energy storage devices, such as batteries or super capacitors, can be added to the system. Energy storage will help the engines level out load variations from the thrusters and other large loads.

===Operational optimization===

DC distribution system allows for new ways of thinking regarding operational optimization. The system is flexible and can combine different energy sources such as engines, turbines, and fuel cells. This means that there is the potential to implement an energy management system that takes into account varying fuel prices and the availability of different fuels.

==Challenges==

Because the main AC switchboard with its AC [[circuit breakers]] and protection relays is omitted from the new design, a new protection philosophy that fulfills class requirements is needed for selectivity and equipment protection. ABB has proposed a solution for protecting the DC distribution system using a combination of fuses and controlled turn-off semiconductor power devices. Because all energy-producing components have controllable switching devices, the fault current can be blocked much faster than is possible with traditional circuit breakers with associated protection relays.

'''Decalage''' on a [[fixed-wing aircraft]] is the angle difference between the upper and lower wings of a [[biplane]], i.e. the acute angle contained between the [[Chord (aircraft)|chords]] of the wings in question.

Decalage is said to be positive when the upper wing has a higher [[angle of incidence (aerodynamics)|angle of incidence]] than the lower wing, and negative when the lower wing's incidence is greater than that of the upper wing. Positive decalage results in greater lift from the upper wing than the lower wing, the difference increasing with the amount of decalage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aerade.cranfield.ac.uk/ara/1927/naca-tn-269.pdf NACA technical report No.269] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716225431/http://aerade.cranfield.ac.uk/ara/1927/naca-tn-269.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }} ''The Distribution of Loads Between the Wings of a Biplane Having Decalage'' (November 1927), p.18. Retrieved on 9 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [http://a.moirier.free.fr/Conception/Formules%20sp%E9ciales/Biplans/The%20fine%20old%20art%20of%20rigging%20a%20biplane%2002.pdf survey of representative biplanes], real-life design decalage is typically zero, with both wings having equal incidence.  A notable exception is the Stearman PT-17, which has 4&amp;deg; of incidence in the lower wing, and 3&amp;deg; in the upper wing.  Considered from an aerodynamic perspective, it is desirable to have the forward-most wing stall first, which will induce a pitch-down moment, aiding in stall recovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://booksite.elsevier.com/9780123973085/content/APP-C1-DESIGN_OF_CONVENTIONAL_AIRCRAFT.pdf Appendix C1 to "General Aviation Aircraft Design" by Snorri Gudmundson; section C1.2, p.9]&lt;/ref&gt;  Biplane designers may use incidence to control stalling behavior, but may also use airfoil selection or other means to accomplish correct behavior.

Decalage angle can also refer to the difference in angle of the chord line of the wing and the chord line of the horizontal stabilizer. This is different from the [[angle of incidence (aerodynamics)|angle of incidence]], which refers to the angle of the wing chord to the longitudinal axis of the fuselage, without reference to the horizontal stabilizer.

'''''Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures''''' is an [[encyclopedia]] edited by [[Helaine Selin]] and published by [[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] in 1997, with a second edition in  2008, and third edition in 2016.

==Summary==
From the Preface:
:The purpose of the ''Encyclopaedia'' is to bring together knowledge of many disparate fields in one place to legitimize the study of other cultures' science... The Western academic divisions of science, technology and medicine have been united in the ''Encyclopaedia'' because in ancient cultures these disciplines were connected.
The first edition (1997) has 600 articles by a range of experts. The arrangement is alphabetical from "Abacus" to "Zu Chongzi". It includes an index from page 1079 to page 1117. [[K. V. Sarma]] contributed 35 articles, Greg De Young 13, Boris A. Rosenfeld 12, and Emilia Calvo and Ho Peng Yoke 11 each. [[Fabrizio Pregadio]] contributed 10 articles, Julio Samo wrote 9, and Richard Bertschinger, [[Radha Charan Gupta]] and [[David A. King (historian)|David A. King]] wrote 8 each. Dozens of other contributors wrote fewer articles.

In 2008 the ''Encyclopaedia'' was split into two volumes and extended to 1000 articles for a second edition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/philosophy/epistemology+and+philosophy+of+science/book/978-1-4020-4559-2 Springer]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
* Toby E. Huff (1999) Review: EHSTMNC, [[Isis (journal)|Isis]] 90(2):410,1 {{doi|10.1086/284409}}
: "A splendid piece of joint scholarship, and some would say long overdue."
: Huff counts nine entries on maps and map making, five on geometry, eleven on environment, four on city planning, five on east-west issues, six on colonialism, six on textile technology, ten on weights and measures
* Jensine Andresen (1999) Review: EHSTMNC, [[Zygon (journal)|Zygon]] {{doi|10.1111/0591-2385.00218}}
: Dispels the illusion that "members of non-Western cultures have offered only marginal contributions to the rigorous investigation of the natural world".
: "Catalyzes a thorough reconsideration of the scope of the ideational nexus influencing the interaction between religion and science in the West."
: Andresen characterizes the contributors an "iconoclastic bunch".
* Sujit Sivasundaram (2010) Review: EHSTMNC second edition, [[The British Journal for the History of Science]] {{doi|10.1017/S000708741000049X}}
: "Turning points in the European historical narrative are being contextualized within other senses of chronology and space, and so decentralized from their mythic status as events in the birth of modern science."
: The second edition shifts "from advocacy to analysis". The reviewer considers the term ''Non-Western'' to be outdated, particularly as [[ethnobotany]] regions proliferate, and Europe is excluded except as the colonizer.

[[File:Generic energy system supplying fuels and electricity.svg|thumb|300px|Physical components of a generic energy system supplying fuels and electricity (but not [[district heating|district heat]]) to end-users]]

An '''energy system''' is a system primarily designed to supply [[#Energy-services|energy-services]] to [[end user|end-users]].&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}  Taking a structural viewpoint, the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] defines an energy system as "all components related to the production, conversion, delivery, and use of energy".&lt;ref name="allwood-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|1261}}  The field of [[energy economics]] includes [[energy market]]s and treats an energy system as the technical and economic systems that satisfy [[consumer demand]] for energy in the forms of [[heat]], [[fuel]]s, and [[electricity]].&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}

The first two definitions allow for demand-side measures, including [[daylighting]], retrofitted [[building insulation]], and [[passive solar building design]], as well as socio-economic factors, such as aspects of [[energy demand management]] and even [[telecommuting]], while the third does not.  Neither does the third account for the [[Informal sector|informal economy]] in traditional [[biomass]] that is significant in many [[Developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name="van-ruijven-etal-2008"/&gt;

The analysis of energy systems thus spans the disciplines of [[engineering]] and [[economics]].&lt;ref name="hoffman-and-wood-1976"/&gt;{{rp|1}}  Merging ideas from both areas to form a coherent description, particularly where [[macroeconomic]] dynamics are involved, is challenging.&lt;ref name="boehringer-and-rutherford-2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="herbst-etal-2012"/&gt;

The concept of an energy system is evolving as new regulations, technologies, and practices enter into service – for example, [[emissions trading]], the development of [[smart grid]]s, and the greater use of [[energy demand management]], respectively.

== Treatment ==

{{see also|Energy industry|Energy modeling}}
&lt;!-- {(see also|Energy industry|Energy modeling|Open energy system models}} --&gt;

From a structural perspective, an energy system is like any [[System|general system]] and is made up of a set of interacting component parts, located within an environment.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster-system"/&gt;  These components derive from ideas found in [[engineering]] and [[economics]].  Taking a process view, an energy system "consists of an integrated set of technical and economic activities operating within a complex societal framework".&lt;ref name="hoffman-and-wood-1976"/&gt;{{rp|423}}  The identification of the components and behaviors of an energy system depends on the circumstances, the purpose of the analysis, and the questions under investigation.  The concept of an energy system is therefore an [[Abstraction (software engineering)|abstraction]] which usually precedes some form of computer-based investigation, such as the construction and use of a suitable [[energy modeling|energy model]].&lt;ref name="anandarajah-etal-2009"/&gt;

Viewed in engineering terms, an energy system lends itself to representation as a [[flow network]]: the [[Glossary of graph theory#vertex|vertices]] map to engineering components like [[power station]]s and [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and the [[Glossary of graph theory#edge|edges]] map to the interfaces between these components.  This approach allows collections of similar or adjacent components to be aggregated and treated as one to simplify the model.  Once described thus, flow network algorithms, such as [[minimum-cost flow problem|minimum cost flow]], may be applied.&lt;ref name="quelhas-etal-2007"/&gt;  The components themselves can be treated as simple [[dynamical systems]] in their own right.&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;

Conversely, relatively pure economic modeling may adopt a sectorial approach with only limited engineering detail present.  The sector and sub-sector categories published by the [[International Energy Agency]] are often used as a basis for this analysis.  A 2009 study of the UK residential energy sector contrasts the use of the technology-rich [[Markal model]] with several UK sectoral housing stock models.&lt;ref name="kannan-and-strachan-2007"/&gt;

International [[statistical study of energy data|energy statistics]] are typically broken down by carrier, sector and sub-sector, and country.&lt;ref name="ires-2016"/&gt;  Energy carriers ({{abbr|aka|also known as}} energy products) are further classified as [[primary energy]] and [[primary energy#Conversion to energy carriers (or secondary energy)|secondary]] (or intermediate) energy and sometimes final (or end-use) energy.  Published energy datasets are normally adjusted so that they are internally consistent, meaning that all energy stocks and flows must [[Energy balance (energy economics)|balance]].  The IEA regularly publishes energy statistics and energy balances with varying levels of detail and cost and also offers mid-term projections based on this data.&lt;ref name="iea-2016a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iea-2016b"/&gt;  The notion of an energy carrier, as used in [[energy economics]], is distinct and different from the definition of [[energy]] used in physics.

Energy systems can range in scope, from local, municipal, national, and regional, to global, depending on issues under investigation.  Researchers may or may not include demand side measures within their definition of an energy system.  The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] does so, for instance, but covers these measures in separate chapters on transport, buildings, industry, and agriculture.{{efn|The IPCC chapter on agriculture is titled: Agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU).}}&lt;ref name="allwood-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|1261}}&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|516}}

Household consumption and investment decisions may also be included within the ambit of an energy system.  Such considerations are not common because consumer behavior is difficult to characterize, but the trend is to include human factors in models.  Household decision-taking may be represented using techniques from [[bounded rationality]] and [[Agent-based model|agent-based behavior]].&lt;ref name="wittmann-and-bruckner-2009"/&gt;  The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) specifically advocates that "more attention should be paid to incorporating behavioral considerations other than price- and income-driven behavior into economic models [of the energy system]".&lt;ref name="aaas-2011"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

== Energy-services ==

{{see also|Energy conservation|Efficient energy use}}

The concept of an energy-service is central, particularly when defining the purpose of an energy system:

{{quote|It is important to realize that the use of energy is no end in itself but is always directed to satisfy human needs and desires. Energy services are the ends for which the energy system provides the means.&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}}}

Energy-services can be defined as amenities that are either furnished through energy consumption or could have been thus supplied.&lt;ref name="morrison-etal-2005"/&gt;{{rp|2}}  More explicitly:

{{quote|Demand should, where possible, be defined in terms of energy-service provision, as characterized by an appropriate intensity{{efn|The term ''intensity'' refers to quantities which do not scale with component size.  See [[intensive and extensive properties]].}} – for example, air [[temperature]] in the case of space-heating or [[lux]] levels for [[illuminance]]. This approach facilitates a much greater set of potential responses to the question of supply, including the use of energetically-passive techniques – for instance, retrofitted [[Building insulation|insulation]] and [[daylighting]].&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2003"/&gt;{{rp|156}}}}

A consideration of energy-services per capita and how such services contribute to human welfare and individual quality of life is paramount to the debate on [[sustainable energy]].  People living in poor regions with low levels of energy-services consumption would clearly benefit from greater consumption, but the same is not generally true for those with high levels of consumption.&lt;ref name="haas-etal-2008"/&gt;

The notion of energy-services has given rise to [[energy service company|energy-service companies]] (ESCo) who contract to provide energy-services to a client for an extended period.  The ESCo is then free to choose the best means to do so, including investments in the thermal performance and [[HVAC]] equipment of the buildings in question.&lt;ref name="duplessis-etal-2012"/&gt;

== ISO 13600, 13601, 13602 on technical energy systems ==

ISO{{nnbsp}}13600, ISO{{nnbsp}}13601, and ISO{{nnbsp}}13602 form a set of [[international standard]]s covering technical energy systems (TES).&lt;ref name="iso-13600-1997-main"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13600-1997-corrigendum-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13601-1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13602-2002"/&gt;  Although withdrawn prior to 2016, these documents provide useful definitions and a framework for formalizing such systems.  The standards depict an energy system broken down into supply and demand sectors, linked by the flow of tradable energy commodities (or energywares).  Each sector has a set of inputs and outputs, some intentional and some harmful byproducts.  Sectors may be further divided into subsectors, each fulfilling a dedicated purpose.  The demand sector is ultimately present to supply energyware-based services to consumers (see [[#Energy-services|energy-services]]).

 | quote = Demand should, where possible, be defined in terms of energy-service provision, as characterized by an appropriate intensity – for example, air temperature in the case of space-heating or lux levels for illuminance. This approach facilitates a much greater set of potential responses to the question of supply, including the use of energetically-passive techniques – for instance, retrofitted insulation and daylighting.

 | quote = In energy economics, energy systems are usually defined as technical and economic systems meeting the energy demand.  "However, the energy demand is not a fixed quantity but is subject to various influences, e.g., prices, regulations, and consumer preferences. Thus, the definition of energy systems should provide a much broader, socioeconomic view and refer to the technical and economic side of energy supply as well as the socioeconomic phenomena occurring in a society, which uses energy to enhance its standard of living; furthermore the impact on the natural environment is important. ... It is important to realize that the use of energy is no end in itself but is always directed to satisfy human needs and desires. Energy services are the ends for which the energy system provides the means. (page 941)

 | quote = The energy system consists of an integrated set of technical and economic activities operating within a complex societal framework.  Energy is a vital component in the economic and social well-being of a nation and must be considered explicitly in the formulation of regional, national, and international policy.  As the importance of energy in policy making has become apparent, research and analysis in the field of energy system modeling and forecasting has grown rapidly.  The field has evolved from one almost exclusively the domain of planning groups in the major sectors of the energy industry and of government regulatory agencies to one in which many Federal and State agencies are active in the development and application of energy models and forecasts.  Energy system models are now used extensively for regional, national and international forecasting and for policy formulation and analysis.

It can be a special repetition, arrangement or omission of words with literal meaning, or a phrase with a specialized meaning not based on the literal meaning of the words.{{dubious|date=July 2016}} Figures of speech often provide emphasis, freshness of expression, or clarity. However, clarity may also suffer from their use, as figures of speech can introduce an ambiguity between literal and figurative interpretation.{{dubious|date=July 2016}}

== Four rhetorical operations ==
{{Main|Rhetorical operations}}

[[Classical rhetoric]]ians classified figures of speech into [[rhetorical operations|four categories]] or ''[[quadripartita]] ratio'':&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;Jansen, Jeroen (2008) ''[http://www.verloren.nl/boeken/2086/263/2126/renaissance/imitatio Imitatio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714140654/http://www.verloren.nl/boeken/2086/263/2126/renaissance/imitatio |date=2015-07-14 }}'' {{ISBN|978-90-8704-027-7}} [http://home.medewerker.uva.nl/j.jansen/page1.html Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205211147/http://home.medewerker.uva.nl/j.jansen/page1.html |date=2008-12-05 }} translated to English by Kristine Steenbergh. Quote from the summary: &lt;blockquote&gt;Using these formulas, a pupil could render the same subject or theme in a myriad of ways. For the mature author, this principle offered a set of tools to rework source texts into a new creation. In short, the quadripartita ratio offered the student or author a ready-made framework, whether for changing words or the transformation of entire texts. Since it concerned relatively mechanical procedures of adaptation that for the most part could be learned, the techniques concerned could be taught at school at a relatively early age, for example in the improvement of pupils’ own writing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

* addition (''adiectio''), also called repetition/expansion/superabundance
* omission (''detractio''), also called subtraction/abridgement/lack
* transposition (''transmutatio''), also called transferring
* permutation (''immutatio''), also called switching/interchange/substitution/transmutation

These categories are often still used. The earliest known text listing them, though not explicitly as a system, is the ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'', of unknown authorship, where they are called πλεονασμός (addition), ἔνδεια (omission), μετάθεσις (transposition) and ἐναλλαγή (permutation).&lt;ref&gt;Book V, 21.29, pp.303–5&lt;/ref&gt; Quintillian then mentioned them in ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Institutio Oratoria, Vol. I, Book I, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/1B*.html Chapter 5], paragraphs 6 and 38–41. And also in Book VI [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/6C*.html Chapter 3]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philo of Alexandria]] also listed them as addition (πρόσθεσις), subtraction (ἀφαίρεσις), transposition (μετάθεσις), and transmutation (ἀλλοίωσις).&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4B*.html Rhetorica ad Herennium]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Figures of speech come in many varieties. The aim is to use the language inventively to accentuate the effect of what is being said. A few examples follow:

* "Around the rugged rocks the ragged rascal ran" is an example of [[alliteration]], where the consonant ''r'' is used repeatedly.
:Whereas, "Sister Suzy sewing socks for soldiers" is a particular form of alliteration called [[sibilance]], because it repeats the letter ''s''.
:Both are commonly used in poetry.
* "She would run up the stairs and then a new set of curtains" is a variety of [[zeugma]] called a [[syllepsis]]. ''Run up'' refers to ascending and also to manufacturing. The effect is enhanced by the momentary suggestion, through a [[pun]], that she might be climbing up the curtains. The [[ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]] or omission of the second use of the verb makes the reader think harder about what is being said.
* "Painful pride" is an [[oxymoron]] where two contradictory ideas are placed in the same sentence.
*"An Einstein" is an example of [[synecdoche]], as it uses a particular name to represent a class of people: geniuses.
* "I had butterflies in my stomach" is a [[metaphor]], referring to a nervous feeling as if there were flying insects in one's stomach.
:To say "it was like having some butterflies in my stomach" would be a [[simile]], because it uses the word ''like'' which is missing in the metaphor.
:To say "It was like having a butterfly farm in my stomach", "It felt like a butterfly farm in my stomach", or "I was so nervous that I had a butterfly farm in my stomach" could be a [[hyperbole]], because it is exaggerated.
*"That filthy place was really dirty" is an example of [[Tautology (grammar)|tautology]], as there are the two words ('filthy' and 'dirty') having almost the same meaning and are repeated so as to make the text more emphatic.

Scholars of classical Western rhetoric have divided figures of speech into two main categories: schemes and tropes. ''[[Scheme (linguistics)|Schemes]]'' (from the Greek {{lang|grc-Latn|schēma}}, 'form or shape') are figures of speech that change the ordinary or expected pattern of words. For example, the phrase, "John, my best friend" uses the scheme known as [[apposition]]. ''[[Trope (linguistics)|Tropes]]'' (from Greek {{lang|grc-Latn|trepein}}, 'to turn') change the general meaning of words. An example of a trope is irony, which is the use of words to convey the opposite of their usual meaning ("For Brutus is an honorable man; / So are they all, all honorable men").

During the [[Renaissance]], scholars meticulously enumerated and classified figures of speech. [[Henry Peacham (born 1546)|Henry Peacham]], for example, in his ''The Garden of Eloquence'' (1577), enumerated 184 different figures of speech. Professor Robert DiYanni, in his book "Literature – Reading Fiction, Poetry, Drama and the Essay"&lt;ref&gt;Second Edition, McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0-07-557112-9}}, pp.451&lt;/ref&gt; wrote: "Rhetoricians have catalogued more than 250 different ''figures of speech'', expressions or ways of using words in a nonliteral sense."

For simplicity, this article divides the figures between schemes and tropes, but does not further sub-classify them (e.g., "Figures of Disorder"). Within each category, words are listed alphabetically. Most entries link to a page that provides greater detail and relevant examples, but a short definition is placed here for convenience. Some of those listed may be considered [[rhetorical device]]s, which are similar in many ways.

=== Schemes ===

* [[Accumulation (figure of speech)|accumulation]]: Accumulating arguments in a concise forceful manner.
* [[adnomination]]: Repetition of words with the same [[root word]].
* [[alliteration]]: a literary stylistic device, where a series of words in a row have the same first consonant sound. 
*:(E.g.: "She sells sea shells by the sea shore".
* [[adynaton]]: [[hyperbole]] It is an extreme exaggeration used to make a point. It is like the opposite of "understatement".
*:E.g.: "I've told you a million times." 
* [[anacoluthon]]: Transposition of clauses to achieve an unnatural order in a sentence.

Since health literacy is a primary contributing factor to [[health disparities]], it is a continued and increasing concern for health professionals. The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) conducted by the US Department of Education found that 36% of participants scored as either "basic" or "below basic" in terms of their health literacy and concluded that approximately 80 million Americans have limited health literacy.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Health Literacy of America's Adults: Results From the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy|last=Kutner|first=MA|last2=Greenberg|first2=E|last3=Jin|first3=Y|last4=Paulson|first4=C|publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|year=2006|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals have difficulty with common health tasks including reading the label of a prescribed drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=America's Health Literacy: Why We Need Accessible Health Information|url=http://health.gov/communication/literacy/issuebrief/|website=health.gov|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several factors may influence health literacy. However, the following factors have been shown to strongly increase this risk: age (especially patients 65 years and older), limited English language proficiency or English as a second language, less education, and lower socioeconomic status. Patients with low health literacy understand less about their medical conditions and treatments and overall report worse health status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1999-02-10|title=Health literacy: report of the Council on Scientific Affairs. Ad Hoc Committee on Health Literacy for the Council on Scientific Affairs, American Medical Association|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10022112|journal=JAMA|volume=281|issue=6|pages=552–557|issn=0098-7484|pmid=10022112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various interventions, such as simplifying information and illustrations, avoiding [[jargon]], using "[[The teach-back method|teach-back]]" methods, and encouraging patients' questions, have improved health behaviors in persons with low health literacy. The proportion of adults aged 18 and over in the U.S., in the year 2010, who reported that their health care providers always explained things so they could understand them was about 60.6%.&lt;ref name="healthypeople.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/health-communication-and-health-information-technology/national-snapshot|title=Health Communication and Health Information Technology - Healthy People 2020|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number increased 1% from 2007 to 2010.&lt;ref name="healthypeople.gov" /&gt; The [[Healthy People program#Healthy People 2010 and Healthy People 2020|Healthy People 2020]] initiative of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] has included health literacy as a pressing new topic, with objectives for improving it in the decade to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/overview.aspx?topicid=18|title=Health Communication and Health Information Technology - Healthy People 2020|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Society as a whole is responsible for improving health literacy. Most importantly, improving health literacy is the responsibility of healthcare and public health professionals and systems.

==Characteristics==

=== Plain language ===
In order to have a patient that understands health terms and can make proper health decisions, the language used by health professionals has to be at a level that others who are not in the medical field can understand. Health professionals must know their audience in order to better serve their patients. The language used by these professionals should be [[plain language]]. Plain language is a strategy for making written and oral information easier to understand; it is communication that users can understand the first time they read or hear it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Health Literacy - Fact Sheet: Health Literacy Basics|url = http://health.gov/communication/literacy/quickguide/factsbasic.htm|website = health.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some key elements of plain language include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plainlanguage.gov/howto/guidelines/FederalPLGuidelines/TOC.cfm|title=Federal Plain Language Guidelines: Table of Contents|website=www.plainlanguage.gov|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Organizing information so most important points come first
* Breaking complex information into understandable chunks
* Using simple language and defining technical terms
* Using active voice
* Using lists and tables to make complex material easier to understand

The National Institute of Health (NIH) recommends that patient education materials should be not written higher than a 6th-7th grade reading level; further recommendations provided by the NIH Office of Communications and Public Liaison are published in their [https://www.nih.gov/institutes-nih/nih-office-director/office-communications-public-liaison/clear-communication "Clear Communication" Initiative.]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nih.gov/institutes-nih/nih-office-director/office-communications-public-liaison/clear-communication|title=Clear Communication|work=National Institutes of Health (NIH)|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors ===
Many factors determine the health literacy level of [[health education]] materials or interventions: [[Reading level|readability]] of the text, the patient's current state of health, [[language barrier]]s of the patient, cultural appropriateness of the materials, format and style, sentence structure, use of illustrations, and numerous other factors.

A study of 2,600 patients conducted in 1995 by two US hospitals found that between 26% and 60% of patients could not understand medication directions, a standard [[informed consent]] form, or materials about scheduling an appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=M. V. Williams|year=1995|title=Inadequate functional health literacy among patients at two public hospitals|journal=JAMA|volume=274|issue=21|pages=677–82|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/274/21/1677|accessdate=2006-06-30|doi=10.1001/jama.274.21.1677|pmid=7474271|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) conducted by the US Department of Education found that 36% of participants scored as either "basic" or "below basic" in terms of their health literacy and  concluded that approximately 80 million Americans have limited health literacy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==History==
The young and multidisciplinary field of '''health literacy''' emerged from two groups of experts: physicians, health providers such as nurses,&lt;ref&gt;Dickens, C., and Piano, MR. (2013) "Health literacy and nursing: an update." The American Journal of Nursing.  Jun;113(6):52-7. doi: 10.1097/01.NAJ.0000431271.83277.2f.&lt;/ref&gt; and health educators; and [[Adult Basic Education]] (ABE) and [[English as a second language]] (ESL) practitioners in the field of education. [[Physicians]] and [[nurses]] are a source of patient comprehension and compliance studies. Adult Basic Education / English for Speakers of Languages Other Than English (ABE/ESOL) specialists study and design interventions to help people develop reading, writing, and conversation skills and increasingly infuse curricula with health information to promote better health literacy. A range of approaches to adult education brings health literacy skills to people in traditional classroom settings, as well as where they work and live.

===Biomedical approach===
The [[biomedical approach]] to health literacy that became dominant (in the U.S.) during the 1980s and 1990s often depicted individuals as lacking health literacy or "suffering" from low health literacy. This approach assumed that recipients are passive in their possession and reception of health literacy and believed that models of literacy and health literacy are politically neutral and universally applicable. This approach is found lacking when placed in the context of broader ecological, critical, and cultural approaches to health. This approach has produced, and continues to reproduce, numerous correlational studies.&lt;ref&gt;Pleasant &amp; Kuruvilla, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Level of health literacy is considered adequate when the population has sufficient knowledge, skills, and confidence to guide their own health, and people are able to stay healthy, recover from illness, and/or live with disability or disease.&lt;ref name="McMurray"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne McMurray|title=Community Health and Wellness: A Sociological Approach|location=Brisbane|publisher=Elsevier|year=2007|ISBN=978-0-7295-3788-9|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McMurray states that health literacy is important in a community because it addresses health inequities. It is no coincidence that individuals with lower levels of health literacy live, disproportionally, in communities with lower socio-economic standing. A barrier to achieving adequate health literacy for these individuals is a lack of awareness, or understanding of, information and resources relevant to improving their health. This knowledge gap arises from both patients being unable to understand information presented to them and hospitals' inadequate efforts and materials to address these literacy gaps.

A more robust view of health literacy includes the ability to [[Scientific literacy|understand scientific concepts]], content, and health research; skills in spoken, written, and online communication; critical interpretation of mass media messages; navigating complex systems of health care and governance; knowledge and use of community capital and resources; and using cultural and indigenous knowledge in health decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nutbeam|first=D.|date=2000-09-01|title=Health literacy as a public health goal: a challenge for contemporary health education and communication strategies into the 21st century|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/15.3.259|journal=Health Promotion International|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=259–267|doi=10.1093/heapro/15.3.259|issn=1460-2245}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ratzan|first=S.

This perspective defines health literacy as the wide range of skills, and competencies that people develop over their lifetimes to seek out, comprehend, evaluate, and use health information and concepts to make informed choices, reduce health risks, and increase quality of life.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zarcadoolas|first=Christina|last2=Pleasant|first2=Andrew|last3=Greer|first3=David S.|date=June 2005|title=Understanding health literacy: an expanded model|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15788526|journal=Health Promotion International|volume=20|issue=2|pages=195–203|doi=10.1093/heapro/dah609|issn=0957-4824|pmid=15788526}}&lt;/ref&gt; While various definitions vary in wording, they all fall within this conceptual framework.

Defining health literacy in that manner builds the foundation for a multi-dimensional model of health literacy built around four central domains:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

*fundamental literacy,
*scientific literacy,
*civic literacy, and
*cultural literacy.

There are several tests, which have verified reliability in the academic literature that can be administered in order to test one's health literacy. Some of these tests include the Medical Term Recognition Test (METER), which was developed in the United States (2 minute administration time) for the clinical setting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altin|first1=Sibel|last2=Finke|first2=Isabelle|last3=Kautz-Freimuth|first3=Sibylle|last4=Stock|first4=Stephanie|title=The evolution of health literacy assessment tools: a systematic review|journal=BMC Public Health|date=2014|volume=14|issue=1|page=1207|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-14-1207|pmc=4289240|pmid=25418011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The METER includes many words from the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) test.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The Short Assessment of Health Literacy in Spanish and English populations (SAHL-S&amp;E) uses word recognition and multiple choice questions to test a person's comprehension.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The CHC-Test measures Critical Health Competencies and consists of 72 items designed to test a person's understanding of medical concepts, literature searching, basic statistics, and design of experiments and samples.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==Patient safety and outcomes==
According to an [[Institute of Medicine]] (2004) report, low health literacy negatively affects the treatment outcome and safety of care delivery.&lt;ref&gt;The Institute of Medicine: [http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10883.html#toc Health Literacy: A Prescription to End Confusion] (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of health literacy affects all segments of the population.  However, it is disproportionate in certain demographic groups, such as the [[elderly]], [[ethnic minorities]], recent [[immigrants]], and persons with low general [[literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy [http://nces.ed.gov/NAAL/index.asp?file=AssessmentOf/HealthLiteracy/HealthLiteracyResults.asp&amp;PageID=158 The Health Literacy of America's Adults] Retrieved 9 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These populations have a higher risk of hospitalization, longer hospital stays, are less likely to comply with treatment, are more likely to make errors with medication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Terry C.

The mismatch between a clinician's [[communication]] of content and a patient's ability to understand that content can lead to medication errors and adverse medical outcomes. Health literacy skills are not only a problem in the general population. Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, public health workers) can also have poor health literacy skills, such as a reduced ability to clearly explain health issues to patients and the public.&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Anesthesiology abstracts (October 25, 2005), Aaron M.

In addition to tailoring the content of what health professionals communicate to their patients, a well arranged layout, pertinent illustrations, and intuitive format of written materials can improve the usability of health care literature. This in turn can help in effective communication between healthcare providers and their patients.&lt;ref name="IJGM_Gill2012"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2012|title=Readability Assessment of Concussion and Traumatic Brain Injury Publications by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|journal=[[International Journal of General Medicine]]|volume=5|pages=923–933|doi=10.2147/IJGM.S37110|first1=P.S.|last1=Gill|first2=T.S.|last2=Gill|first3=A.|last3=Kamath|first4=B.|last4=whisnant|url=http://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=14417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk identification===
Identifying a patient as having low health literacy is essential for a healthcare professional to conform their health intervention in a way that the patient will understand. When patients with low health literacy receive care that is tailored to their more limited medical knowledge base, results have shown that health behaviors drastically improve. This has been seen with: correct medication use and dosage, utilizing health screenings, as well as increased exercise and smoking cessation. Effective visual aids have shown to help supplement the information communicated by the doctor in the office. In particular, easily readable brochures and videos have shown to be very effective.&lt;ref&gt;Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: Evidence Report/Technology Assessment: Number 87 [http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/epcsums/litsum.htm Literacy and Health Outcomes]&lt;/ref&gt; Healthcare professionals can use many methods to attain patients' health literacy. A multitude of tests used during research studies and three minute assessments commonly used in doctors offices are examples of the variety of tests healthcare professionals can use to better understand their patients' health literacy.&lt;ref name="TOFLA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Conversation/&gt;&lt;ref name=NPSF/&gt;

The American Medical Association showed that asking simple single item questions, such as "How confident are you in filling out medical forms by yourself?", is a very effective and direct way to understand from a patient's point of view how they feel about interacting with their healthcare provider and understanding their health condition.&lt;ref name=Questions/&gt;

===Intervention===
In order to be understood by patients with insufficient health literacy, health professionals must intervene to provide clear and concise information that can be more easily understood. Avoidance of medical jargon, illustrations of important concepts, and confirming information by a "teach back" method have shown to be effective tools to communicating essential health topics with health illiterate patients.&lt;ref name=Conversation&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/conversation-cultural-competence-cindy-brach-senior-health-policy-researcher-ahrq|title=A Conversation on Cultural Competence With Cindy Brach, Senior Health Policy Researcher, AHRQ|date=2013-04-17|accessdate=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A program called "Ask Me 3"&lt;ref name=NPSF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askme3.org/index.asp|title=National Patient Safety Foundation|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308091008/http://www.askme3.org/index.asp|archivedate=2008-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is designed to bring public and physician attention to this issue, by letting patients know that they should ask three questions each time they talk to a doctor, nurse, or pharmacist:
*What is my main problem?
*What do I need to do?
*Why is it important for me to do this?

There have also been large-scale efforts to improve health literacy. For example, a public information program by the US Department of Health and Human Services encourages patients to improve healthcare quality and avoid errors by asking questions about health conditions and treatment.&lt;ref name=Questions&gt;Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: [http://www.ahrq.gov/questionsaretheanswer/ Questions Are the Answer], retrieved 2008-10-18&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the IROHLA (Intervention Research on Health Literacy of the Ageing population)  project, funded by the European Union (EU), seeks to develop evidence-based guidelines for policy and practice to improve health literacy of the ageing population in EU member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irohla.eu/home/|title=Home|publisher=|access-date=2015-06-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613081655/http://www.irohla.eu/home/|archive-date=2015-06-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has developed a framework and identified and validated interventions which together constitute a comprehensive approach of addressing health literacy needs of the elderly.

===Health illiterate-related diabetes prevalence in Vietnamese-American populations===
Diabetes is a rapidly growing health problem among immigrants—affecting approximately 10 percent of Asian-Americans.  It is the fifth-leading cause of death in Asian-Americans between the ages of 45 and 64.  In addition, type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the disease.  Those who are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes have high levels of blood glucose because the body does not effectively respond to insulin.  It is a lifelong disease with no known cure.  Diabetes is a chronic, debilitating, and costly social burden—costing healthcare systems about $100 billion annually.&lt;ref name="Cabiglio"&gt;Cabiglio, Josie. Diabetes on the rise among Asians.  Nguoi Viet 2. Web. 7 Dec 2010.
{{cite web|url=http://nguoi-viet.com/absolutenm/anmviewer.asp?a%3D41207%26z%3D126|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2011-12-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061126043141/http://www.nguoi-viet.com/absolutenm/anmviewer.asp?a=41207&amp;z=126|archivedate=2006-11-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diabetes disproportionately affects underserved and ethnically diverse populations, such as Vietnamese-American communities.  The relationship between the disease and health literacy level is in part because of an individual's ability to read English, evaluate blood glucose levels, and communicate with medical professionals.  Other studies also suggest lack in knowledge of diabetes symptoms and complications.&lt;ref name="Glazier"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Glazier R.H. | year = 2004 | title = Neighborhood recent immigration and hospitalization in Toronto, Canada | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Public Health | volume = 95 | issue = | pages = 130–134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to an observational cross-sectional study conducted, many Vietnamese-American diabetic patients show signs of poor blood glucose control and adherence due to inadequate self-management knowledge and experience.&lt;ref name="Mull"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mull Dorothy S.

==== Oral health literacy in school teachers of Mangalore, India ====
The problem of low oral health literacy (OHL) is often neglected which may lead to poor oral health outcomes and under utilization of oral care services. A cross-sectional survey of  school teachers working in schools at Mangalore, India was undertaken. Details regarding demographics, medical, and dental history, oral hygiene practices and habits, diet history, and decay promoting the potential of school teachers were obtained using face-to-face interview method. The Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Dentistry-99 (REALD-99) was used to assess their OHL.The OHL was high in the school teachers with the REALD-99 scores ranging from 45 to 95 with a mean score of 75.83 ± 9.94. Th This study found that there was a statistically significant difference between OHL and education, frequency of brushing and the filled teeth. Although this study indicated high OHL levels among school teachers in Mangalore, India the magnitude of dental caries in this population was also relatively high and very few had a healthy periodontium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=Arun K|last2=Rao|first2=Ashwini|last3=Rajesh|first3=GuruRaghavendran|last4=Shenoy|first4=Ramya|last5=Pai|first5=Mithun B.

eHealth literacy describes the relatively modern concept of an individual's ability to search for, successfully access, comprehend, and appraise desired health information from electronic sources and to then use such information to attempt to address a particular health problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jmir.org/2006/2/e9/|title=eHealth Literacy: Essential Skills for Consumer Health in a Networked World|first1=Cameron D|last1=Norman|first2=Harvey A|last2=Skinner|date=1 January 2006|publisher=|volume=8|issue=2|doi=10.2196/jmir.8.2.e9|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|page=e9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the increasing influence of the internet for information-seeking and health information distribution purposes, eHealth literacy has become an important topic of research in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayat|first=T|last2=Brainin|first2=E|last3=Neter|first3=E|date=|title=With Some Help From My Network: Supplementing eHealth Literacy With Social Ties|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=19|issue=3|pages=e98.|doi=10.2196/jmir.6472|via=|pmc=5391437|pmid=28360024|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stellefson (2011) states, "8 out of 10 Internet users report that they have at least once looked online for health information, making it the third most popular Web activity next to checking email and using search engines in terms of activities that almost everybody has done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jmir.org/2011/4/e102/|title=eHealth Literacy Among College Students: A Systematic Review With Implications for eHealth Education|first1=Michael|last1=Stellefson|first2=Bruce|last2=Hanik|first3=Beth|last3=Chaney|first4=Don|last4=Chaney|first5=Bethany|last5=Tennant|first6=Enmanuel Antonio|last6=Chavarria|date=1 January 2011|publisher=|volume=13|issue=4|doi=10.2196/jmir.1703|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|page=e102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though in recent years, individuals may have gained access to a multitude of health information via the Internet, access alone does not ensure that proper search skills and techniques are being used to find the most relevant online and electronic resources. As the line between a reputable medical source and an amateur opinion can often be blurred, the ability to differentiate between the two is important.

Health literacy requires a combination of several different literacy skills in order to facilitate eHealth promotion and care.  Six core skills are delineated by an eHealth literacy model referred to as the Lily model.  The Lily Model's six literacies are organized into two central types: analytic and context-specific.  Analytic type literacies are those skills that can be applied to a broad range of sources, regardless of topic or content (i.e., skills that can also be applied to shopping or researching a term paper in addition to health) whereas context-specific skills are those that are contextualized within a specific problem domain (can solely be applied to health).  The six literacies are listed below, the first three of the analytic type and the latter three of the context-specific:
* Traditional literacy
* Media literacy
* Information literacy
* Computer literacy
* Scientific literacy
* Health literacy

According to Norman (2006), both analytical and context-specific literacy skills are "required to fully engage with electronic health resources."  As the World Wide Web and technological innovations are more and more becoming a part of the healthcare environment, it is important for information technology to be properly utilized to promote health and deliver health care effectively. Furthermore, it was argued by Hayat Brainin &amp; Neter (2017), that digital media fosters the creation of interpersonal ties, that can supplement eHealth literacy. According to Hayat Brainin &amp; Neter (2017), individuals with low eHealth literacy who were able to recruit help when performing online activities demonstrated higher health outcomes compared to similar individuals who did not find help. Also relating to the proliferation of digital media is the fact that many individuals now can create their own ‘media content’ ([[user-generated content]]). This means that the boundary between “information” and “media” content, as proposed by Norman in 2006, now is increasingly blurred, creating additional challenges for health practitioners (Holmberg, 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Holmberg C | year = 2016 | title = If You can't beat It-Use It: why and how clinicians need to consider social media in the treatment of adolescents with obesity | url = | journal = European Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 70 | issue = 9| pages = 977–8 | doi = 10.1038/ejcn.2016.126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that the move towards [[Patient-centred care|patient-centered care]] and the greater use of technology for self-care and self-management requires higher health literacy on the part of the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Henna|last2=Xie|first2=Bo|title=Health literacy in the eHealth era: A systematic review of the literature|journal=Patient Education and Counseling|date=January 2017|doi=10.1016/j.pec.2017.01.015|volume=100|pages=1073–1082}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been noted in several research studies, for example among adolescent patients with obesity.&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, C., Berg, C., Dahlgren, J., Lissner, L., &amp; Chaplin, J. E. (2018). Health literacy in a complex digital media landscape: Pediatric obesity patients’ experiences with online weight, food, and health information. Health Informatics Journal. Mar 1:1460458218759699. doi: 10.1177/1460458218759699&lt;/ref&gt;

== Improvement ==

=== Incorporate information through the university level ===
The [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] created a National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.gov/communication/hlactionplan/pdf/Health_Literacy_Action_Plan.pdf|title=National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy|date=|accessdate=|website=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the goals of the National Action Plan is to incorporate health and science information in childcare and education through the university level. The target is to educate people at an early stage; that way individuals are raised with health literacy and will have a better quality of life. The earlier an individual is exposed to health literacy skills the better for the person and the community.

Programs such as Head Start&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ohs|title=Home - Office of Head Start - Administration for Children and Families|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) - Food and Nutrition Service|url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/women-infants-and-children-wic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have impacted our society, especially the low income population. Head Start provides low-income children and their families early childhood education, nutrition, and health screenings. Health literacy is integrated in the program for both children and parents through the education given to the individuals. WIC serves low-income pregnant women and new mothers by supplying them with food, health care referrals, and nutrition education. Programs like these help improve the health literacy of both the parent and the child, creating a more knowledgeable community with health education.

Although programs like Head Start and WIC have been working with the health literacy of a specific population, much more can be done with the education of children and young adults. Now, more and more adolescents are getting involved with their health care. It is crucial to educate these individuals in order for them to make informed decisions.

Many schools in the country incorporate a health class in their curriculum. These classes provided an excellent opportunity to facilitate and develop health literacy in today's children and adolescents. The skills of how to read food labels, the meaning of common medical terms, the structure of the human body, and education on the most prevalent diseases in the United States should be taught in both private and public schools. This way new generations will grow with health literacy and would hopefully make knowledgeable health decisions.

=== Framework and potential intervention points ===
The National Library of Medicine defines health literacy as:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|title=Health Literacy: A Prescription to End Confustion|last=Nielsen-Bohlmn|first=Lynn|date=2004|journal=Institute of Medicine|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"The degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health literacy
information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions."}}

Based on this clinical definition, health literacy gives
individuals the skills that they need to both understand and effectively
communicate information and concerns. Bridging that gap between literacy skills
and the ability of the individual in health contexts, the ''Health Literacy Framework'' highlights the health outcomes and costs
associated with health contexts including cognitive abilities, social skills,
emotional state, and physical conditions such as visual and auditory contributions.

''Potential Intervention Points'' are illustrated in reflection of the ''Health Literacy Framework.''
While these potential intervention points include interactions such as those of individuals and the education systems
that they are engaged with, their health systems, and societal factors as they
relate to health literacy, these points are not 
components of a causal model.  The three
potential intervention points are culture and society, the health system, and
the education system. Health outcomes and costs are the products of the health
literacy developed during diversity of exposure to these three potential intervention
points.

Referring to shared ideas, meanings, and values that
influence an individual's beliefs and attitudes, cultural and societal
influences are a significant intervention point for health literacy
development. As interactions with healthcare systems often first occur at the
family level, deeply rooted beliefs and values can shape the significance of
the experience. Included components that reflect the development of health
literacy both culturally and societally are native language, socioeconomic status,
gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as mass media exposure. These
are pathways to understanding American life paralleling conquests for a health
literate America.

The health system is an intervention point in the ''Health Literacy Framework''. For the
purposes of this framework, health literacy refers to an individual's
interaction with people performing health-related activities in settings such
as hospitals, clinics, physician's offices, home health care, public health agencies,
and insurers.

In the United States, the education system consists of [[K-12]] curricula. In addition to this standard educational
setting, adult education programs are also environments in which individuals
can develop traditional literacy skills founded in comprehension and real-world
application of knowledge via reading and writing.  Tools for educational development provided by
these systems impact an individual's capacity to obtain specific knowledge
regarding health. Reflecting components of traditional literacy such as
cultural and conceptual knowledge, oral literacy (listening and speaking,)
print literacy (reading and writing,) and numeracy, education systems are also
potential intervention points for health literacy development.

=== Development of a health literacy program ===
A successful health literacy program will have many goals that all work together to improve health literacy. Many people assume these goals should communicate health information to the general public, however in order to be successful the goals should not only communicate with people but also take into account social and environmental factors that influence lifestyle choices.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nutbeam|first=D.|date=2000-09-01|title=Health literacy as a public health goal: a challenge for contemporary health education and communication strategies into the 21st century|url=https://academic.oup.com/heapro/article/15/3/259/551108/Health-literacy-as-a-public-health-goal-a|journal=Health Promotion International|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=259–267|doi=10.1093/heapro/15.3.259|issn=0957-4824}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good example of this is the movement to end smoking. When a health literacy program is put into place where only the negative side effects of smoking are told to the general public it is doomed to fail. However, when there is a larger program put in – one that includes strategies outlining how to quit smoking, raises tobacco prices, reduces access to tobacco by minors, and reflect social a social unacceptability of smoking – it will be much more effective.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services suggests a National Action Plan to implement a comprehensive Health Literacy Program. They include 7 goals:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|first=Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion|date=2010|title=National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy|url=https://health.gov/communication/hlactionplan/pdf/Health_Literacy_Action_Plan.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Develop and disseminate health and safety information that is accurate, accessible, and actionable
# Promote changes in the health care system that improve health information, communication, informed decision making, and access to health services
# Incorporate accurate, standards-based, and developmentally appropriate health and science information and curricula in child care and education through the university level
# Support and expand local efforts to provide adult education, English language instruction, and culturally and linguistically appropriate health information services in the community
# Build partnerships, develop guidance, and change policies
# Increase basic research and the development, implementation, and evaluation of practices and interventions to improve health literacy
# Increase the dissemination and use of evidence-based health literacy practices and interventions
These goals should be taken into account when implementing a health literacy program.

There are also goals for the outcomes of a Health Literacy Program.

''Health Related Goals''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Promoting and protect health and prevent disease
* Understand, interpret, and analyze health information
* Apply health information over a variety of life events and situations
* Navigate the healthcare system 
* Actively participate in encounters with healthcare professionals and workers
* Understand and give consent
* Understand and advocate for rights

===Libraries===
Libraries have increasingly recognised that they can play a role in health literacy since the 2000s, influenced by the [[Medical Library Association]].  Library initiatives have included running education programs, fostering partnerships with health organisations, and using outreach efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=13 June 2016|title=Health literacy and libraries: a literature review|journal=[[Reference Services Review]]|volume=44|issue=2|pages=191–205|doi=10.1108/RSR-02-2016-0005|last1=Barr-Walker|first1=Jill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of the motorcycle''' begins in the second half of the 19th century. [[Motorcycle]]s are descended from the "[[safety bicycle]]," a bicycle with front and rear wheels of the same size and a pedal crank mechanism to drive the rear wheel.&lt;ref name="The Past - 1800s: First motorcycle"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Past - 1800s: First motorcycle | work=The History and Future of Motorcycles and motorcycling - From 1885 to the Future, Total Motorcycle Website | url=http://www.totalmotorcycle.com/future.htm#1800s | accessdate=2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite some early landmarks in its development, the motorcycle lacks a rigid pedigree that can be traced back to a single idea or machine. Instead, the idea seems to have occurred to numerous engineers and inventors around Europe at around the same time.

==Early steam-powered cycles==
[[File:Copeland stoomfiets 1894.jpg|thumb|Lucius Copeland 1894]]
In the 1860s [[Pierre Michaux]], a [[blacksmith]] in Paris, founded 'Michaux et Cie' ("Michaux and company"), the first company to construct [[bicycle]]s with [[bicycle pedal|pedals]] called a [[velocipede]] at the time, or "Michauline".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/page/?o=3Tzut&amp;page_id=40617&amp;v=9j Michauline]&lt;/ref&gt; The first steam powered motorcycle, the [[Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede]], can be traced to 1867, when Pierre's son Ernest Michaux fitted a small steam engine to one of the 'velocipedes'.&lt;ref name="Burgess"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgess Wise|first=David|title=Historic Motor Cycles|publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|isbn=0-600-34407-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design went to America when [[Pierre Lallement]], a Michaux employee who also claimed to have developed the prototype in 1863, filed for the first bicycle patent with the US patent office in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bicycling.about.com/od/thebikelife/ss/History_3.htm|title=The Boneshaker - Invented by Michaux and Lallement|last=Fiedler|first=David|work=About.com|accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868 an American, [[Sylvester H. Roper]] of [[Roxbury, Massachusetts]] developed a twin-cylinder [[Roper steam velocipede|steam velocipede]], with a coal-fired boiler between the wheels. Roper's contribution to motorcycle development ended suddenly when he died demonstrating one of his machines in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] on June 1, 1896.&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt;

Also in 1868, a French engineer [[Louis-Guillaume Perreaux]] patented a similar steam powered single cylinder machine, the [[Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede]], with an alcohol burner and twin belt drives, which was possibly invented independently of Roper's. Although the patent is dated 1868, nothing indicates the invention had been operable before 1871.&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt;

In 1881, [[Lucius Copeland]] of [[Phoenix, Arizona]] designed a much smaller steam boiler which could drive the large rear wheel of an [[American Star Bicycle|American Star]] [[Penny-farthing|high-wheeler]] at 12&amp;nbsp;mph. In 1887 Copeland formed the Northrop Manufacturing Co. to produce the first successful 'Moto-Cycle' (actually a three-wheeler).&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt;

==Experimentation and invention==
[[File:Butler's Patent Velocycle.jpg|left|thumb|Butler's Patent Velocycle]]
The very first commercial design for a self-propelled [[bicycle]] was a three-wheel design called the ''Butler Petrol Cycle'', conceived of and built by [[Edward Butler (inventor)|Edward Butler]] in [[England]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/394358/motorcycle|title=motorcycle (vehicle)|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; He exhibited his plans for the vehicle at the [[Stanley Cycle Show]] in London in 1884, two years earlier than [[Karl Benz]] invented his first automobile who is generally recognized as the inventor of the modern automobile. Butler's vehicle was also the first design to be shown at the 1885 [[International Inventions Exhibition]] in London.

The vehicle was built by the [[Merryweather &amp; Sons|Merryweather Fire Engine]] company in [[Greenwich, England|Greenwich]], in 1888.&lt;ref name="Georgano"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[G.N. Georgano]]|title=Early and Vintage Years, 1885-1930: The Golden Era of Coachbuilding|publisher=Mason Crest Publishers|year=2002|page=22|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1590844912&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Butler '''Petrol Cycle''' (first recorded use of the term)&lt;ref name="Georgano" /&gt; It was a three-wheeled vehicle, with the rear wheel directly driven by a &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;hp (466W) 600 cc (40 in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; 2¼×5-inch {57×127-mm})&lt;ref name="Georgano"/&gt; flat twin [[four stroke]] engine (with [[magneto]] ignition replaced by coil and battery),&lt;ref name="Georgano"/&gt; equipped with [[rotary valves]] and a float-fed [[carburettor]] (five years before [[Wilhelm Maybach|Maybach]]),&lt;ref name="Georgano"/&gt; and [[Ackermann steering geometry|Ackermann steering]],&lt;ref&gt;[[G.N. Georgano]], p.20 cap.&lt;/ref&gt; all of which were state of the art at the time. Starting was by compressed air.&lt;ref name="Georgano"/&gt; The engine was liquid-cooled, with a [[radiator]] over the rear driving wheel. Speed was controlled by means of a [[throttle]] valve lever. No braking system was fitted; the vehicle was stopped by raising and lowering the rear driving wheel using a foot-operated lever; the weight of the machine was then borne by two small castor wheels. The driver was seated between the front wheels.&lt;ref name="Georgano"/&gt; It wasn't, however, a commercial success, as Butler failed to find sufficient financial backing.

[[File:Daimler-1-motorcycle-1.jpg|thumb|Replica of the 1885 Daimler-Maybach [[Daimler Reitwagen|''Reitwagen'']]]]
Another early [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion]], [[petroleum]] fueled motorcycle was the [[Daimler Reitwagen|''Petroleum Reitwagen]]. It was designed and built by the German inventors [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] in [[Bad Cannstatt]], Germany in 1885.&lt;ref name="ThePast1800s"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Past –  1800s: First motorcycle | work=The History and Future of Motorcycles and motorcycling –  From 1885 to the Future, Total Motorcycle Website | url=http://www.totalmotorcycle.com/future.htm#1800s | accessdate=28 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This vehicle was unlike either the [[safety bicycle]]s or the [[Boneshaker (bicycle)|boneshaker]] bicycles of the era in that it had zero degrees of [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry#Steering axis angle|steering axis angle]] and no [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry#Fork offset|fork offset]], and thus did not use the principles of [[bicycle and motorcycle dynamics]] developed nearly 70 years earlier. Instead, it relied on two outrigger wheels to remain upright while turning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Inventing Modern: Growing Up with X-Rays, Skyscrapers, and Tailfins |first=John H. |last=Lienhard |publisher=[[Oxford University Press US]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-19-518951-5 |pages=120&amp;ndash;121 |authorlink=John H.

The inventors called their invention the ''Reitwagen'' ("riding car").

==First commercial products==
In the decade from the late 1880s, dozens of designs and machines emerged, particularly in Germany and in England, and soon spread to America.&lt;ref name="An overview of the British motorcycle industry and its collapse"&gt;{{cite web | title= An overview of the British motorcycle industry and its collapse | author= Ian Chadwick | work= British Motorcycle Manufacturers | date= June 30, 2001 | url= http://www.ianchadwick.com/motorcycles/britbikes/index.html | accessdate= 2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During this early period of motorcycle history there were many manufacturers, since bicycle makers were adapting their designs for the new [[internal combustion engine]].

[[File:1894 Hildebrand &amp; Wolfmüller diagram.png|thumb|left|Diagram of 1894 Hildebrand &amp; Wolfmüller.]]
In 1894 [[Hildebrand &amp; Wolfmüller]] became the first series production motorcycle, and the first to be called a "motorcycle" ({{lang-de|Motorrad}}).&lt;ref name=Setright1979/&gt;&lt;ref name=Falco1999/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Kresnak|first= Bill|year= 2008|title= Motorcycling for Dummies|publisher= [[For Dummies]], [[Wiley Publishing]]|isbn= 0-470-24587-5|location= [[Hoboken, New Jersey]]|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZPgrJByqp4wC|page= |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Brief History of the Marque: Hildebrand &amp; Wolfmuller | work= Hildebrand &amp; Wolfmuller Motorad, European Motorcycle Universe | url= http://www.cybermotorcycle.com/euro/brands/hildebrand_wolfmuller.htm | accessdate= 28 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only a few hundred examples of this motorcycle were ever built. The first instance of the term "motor cycle" also appears in English the same year in materials promoting machines developed by [[E.J. Pennington]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atthecreation.com/first.mc/Worlds.First.Motorcycle.html Wagner,Herbert "The World's First Motorcycle Origin of the Word and Device"]&lt;/ref&gt; although Pennington's motorcycles never progressed past the prototype stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ianchadwick.com/motorcycles/britbikes/brit_p.html Chadwick, Ian. "Pennington" (in list of) British motorcycle manufacturers P:, June 6, 2003], retrieved March 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Excelsior Motor Company]], originally a bicycle-manufacturing company based in [[Coventry]] in Warwickshire ([[England]]), began production of their first motorcycle model in 1896, available for purchase by the public. The first production motorcycle in the US was the Orient-Aster, built by [[Metz Company|Charles Metz]] in 1898 at his factory in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]].

In 1898, [[Peugeot Motocycles]] presents at the [[Paris Motor Show|Paris Motorshow]] the first motorcycle equipped with a Dion-Bouton motor. Peugeot Motocycles remains the oldest motorcycle manufacturer in the world.

In the early period of motorcycle history, many producers of [[bicycle]]s adapted their designs to accommodate the new internal-combustion engine. As the engines became more powerful and designs outgrew the bicycle origins, the number of motorcycle producers increased. Many of the nineteenth-century inventors who worked on early motorcycles often moved on to other inventions. Daimler and Roper, for example, both went on to develop automobiles.

At the turn of the 20th century the first major mass-production firms emerged. [[File:Fn-1913.jpg|thumb|A 1913 FN (Fabrique National), Belgium, 4 cylinders and shaft drive]]
In 1901 English quadricycle- and bicycle-maker [[Royal Enfield]] introduced its first motorcycle, with a 239&amp;nbsp;cc engine mounted in the front and driving the rear wheel through a belt. In 1898 English bicycle-maker [[Triumph Engineering Co Ltd|Triumph]] decided to extend its focus to include motorcycles, and by 1902 the company had produced its first motorcycle—a bicycle fitted with a Belgian-built engine. A year later it was the largest motorcycle-manufacturer, with an annual production of over 500 units. Other British firms included [[Norton Motorcycle Company|Norton]] and [[Birmingham Small Arms Company]] who began motorbike production in 1902 and 1910, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bikes4sale.in/wp/756/history-of-motorbikes/|title= History of Motorbikes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901 the [[Indian (motorcycle)|Indian {{not a typo|Motocycle}} Manufacturing Company]], which had been founded by two former bicycle-racers, designed the so-called "diamond framed" Indian Single, whose engine was built by the Aurora Firm in [[Illinois]] per Indian's specifications. The Single was made available in the deep blue. Indian's production was up to over 500 bikes by 1902, and would rise to 32,000, its best ever, in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink = Mick Walker (motorcycling) |last = Walker |first= Mick |year= 2006 |title= Motorcycle: Evolution, Design, Passion |publisher= JHU Press |isbn= 978-0-8018-8530-3 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AHSlknpjrgAC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=Indian+largest#v=onepage&amp;q= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher= The AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame Museum |title= George Hendee |url= http://www.motorcyclemuseum.org/halloffame/hofbiopage.asp?id=68 |accessdate= 8 August 2009 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090910021152/http://www.motorcyclemuseum.org/halloffame/hofbiopage.asp?id=68 |archivedate= September 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The American company [[Harley-Davidson]] started producing motorcycles in 1903.

During this period, experimentation and innovation were driven by the popular new sport of [[motorcycle racing]], with its powerful incentive to produce tough, fast, reliable machines. These enhancements quickly found their way to the public's machines.&lt;ref name="An overview of the British motorcycle industry and its collapse"/&gt;

Chief [[August Vollmer]] of the [[Berkeley, California]] [[Police Department]] is credited{{by whom|date=October 2017}} with organizing the first official [[police motorcycle]]-patrol in the United States in 1911.&lt;ref name="Our History"&gt;{{cite web | title= Our History | work= Berkeley Police Department Online, City of Berkeley, CA | url= http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/police/history/history.html | accessdate= 2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1914, motorcycles were no longer just bicycles with engines; they had their own technologies, although many still maintained bicycle elements, like the seats and suspension.

==The First World War==
[[File:Triumph 1922 H 1.jpg|thumb|[[Triumph Engineering|Triumph Motorcycles]] [[Triumph Type H|Model H]], was mass-produced for the war effort and notable for its reliability.]]
During the [[First World War]], motorbike production was greatly ramped up for the war effort to supply effective communications with front line troops. Messengers on horses were replaced with [[dispatch rider]]s on motorcycles carrying messages, performing reconnaissance personnel and acting as a military police. American company [[Harley-Davidson]] was devoting over 50% of its factory output toward military contract by the end of the war. The British company [[Triumph Engineering|Triumph Motorcycles]] sold more than 30,000 of its [[Triumph Type H]] model to [[Triple Entente|allied forces]] during the war. With the rear wheel driven by a belt, the Model H was fitted with a 499&amp;nbsp;cc air-cooled [[four-stroke]] single-cylinder engine. It was also the first Triumph not to be fitted with pedals, so was a true motorcycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.triumph1.com/triumph_history.htm |title=Triumph history |accessdate=2009-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229100156/http://www.triumph1.com/triumph_history.htm |archivedate=December 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Model H in particular, is regarded by many as having been the first "modern motorcycle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/689/2598/Motorcycle-Article/Triumph-Motorcycle-History.aspx|title=Triumph Motorcycle History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced in 1915 it had a 550cc side-valve four-stroke engine with a three-speed gearbox and belt transmission. It was so popular with its users that it was nicknamed the "Trusty Triumph."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Triumph Motorcycles timeline|url=http://www.ianchadwick.com/motorcycles/triumph/time01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1920, [[Harley-Davidson]] became the largest manufacturer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pcmotors.com/harley.html|title=History of Harley-Davidson Motor Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; with their motorcycles being sold by dealers in 67 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=HOG WILD; U of T professor Brendan Calder is one of the legions of baby boomers who have helped to ensure the success of the Harley-Davidson brand name, not to mention its bottom line.|first=Sharda |last=Prashad |periodical=Toronto Star |location=Toronto, Ont.|date=16 April 2006 | page=A.16 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/1021570771.html?dids=1021570771:1021570771&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Harley-Davidson at 100 |first=Jeremy |last=Cato |periodical=The Vancouver Sun |location=Vancouver, B.C. |date=8 August 2003 |page=E.1.Fro }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BMW Motorrad|BMW motorcycles]] came on the scene in 1923 with a shaft drive and an [[Flat-twin engine|opposed-twin or "boxer"]] [[Unit construction|engine enclosed with the transmission]] in a single aluminum housing.

By 1931, Indian and Harley-Davidson were the only two American manufacturers producing commercial motorcycles.&lt;ref name="HD History: Timeline - 1930s"&gt;{{cite web|title=HD History: Timeline - 1930s |work=Harley-Davidson USA (2001-2007 H-D) |url=http://www.harley-davidson.com/wcm/Content/Pages/H-D_History/history_1930s.jsp?HDCWPSession=lG1xFnTQTTXKR0p6wpHB1N1cHtzdJ1250h8CvxtWctfBkvrFnRG4!-74508550!1457951189&amp;locale=en_US |accessdate=2007-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002044/http://www.harley-davidson.com/wcm/Content/Pages/H-D_History/history_1930s.jsp?HDCWPSession=lG1xFnTQTTXKR0p6wpHB1N1cHtzdJ1250h8CvxtWctfBkvrFnRG4%21-74508550%211457951189&amp;locale=en_US |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This two-company rivalry in the United States remained until 1953, when the Indian Motorcycle factory in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] closed and [[Royal Enfield]] took over the Indian name.&lt;ref name="Post 1953 Indian Motorcycle History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Post 1953 Indian Motorcycle History |work=www.cycletownusa.com |url=http://www.cycletownusa.com/post1953.html |accessdate=2007-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704104051/http://www.cycletownusa.com/post1953.html |archivedate=July 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were over 80 different makes of motorcycle available in Britain in the 1930s, from the familiar marques like [[Norton (motorcycle)|Norton]], Triumph and [[AJS]] to the obscure, with names like New Gerrard, NUT, SOS, Chell and Whitwood,&lt;ref name="British Motorcycles of the 1930s"&gt;{{cite web | title=British Motorcycles of the 1930s | work=www.webBikeWorld.com, webWorld International, LLC (2001-2007) | url=http://www.webbikeworld.com/books/british-motorcycles-1930.htm | accessdate=2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
about twice as many motorcycle makes competing in the world market during the early 21st century.

In 1937, Joe Petrali set a new [[land speed record]] of 136.183&amp;nbsp;mph (219.165&amp;nbsp;km/h) on a modified Harley-Davidson 61&amp;nbsp;cubic inch (1,000&amp;nbsp;cc) overhead valve-driven motorcycle.&lt;ref name="HD History: Timeline - 1930s"/&gt;
The same day, Petrali also broke the speed record for 45&amp;nbsp;cubic inch (737&amp;nbsp;cc) engine motorcycles.

In Europe, production demands, driven by the buildup to World War II, included motorcycles for military use, and [[Birmingham Small Arms Company#World War II|BSA]] supplied 126,000 [[BSA M20]] motorcycles to the British armed forces, starting in 1937 and continuing until 1950. Royal Enfield also produced motorcycles for the military, including a 125&amp;nbsp;cc lightweight motorcycle that could be dropped (in a parachute-fitted tube cage) from an aircraft.

===After World War II===
[[File:Vespasidecar.JPG|thumb|An original [[Vespa]] with [[sidecar]]]]
After the World War II, some American veterans found a replacement for the camaraderie, excitement, danger and speed of life at war in motorcycles. Grouped into loosely organized clubs, motorcycle riders in the US created a new social institution—the [[motorcyclist]]s or "bikers"—which was later skewed by the "outlaw" persona [[Marlon Brando]] portrayed in the 1953 film ''[[The Wild One]]''.&lt;ref name="Freedom and Postwar Mobility: 1946-1958"&gt;{{cite web |title=Freedom and Postwar Mobility: 1946-1958 | work=[[The Art of the Motorcycle]], Guggenheim Museum | url=http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/motorcycle/motorcycle/1946-1958.html | accessdate=2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, on the other hand, post-war motorcycle producers were more concerned with designing practical, economical transportation than the social aspects, or "biker" image.&lt;ref name="Freedom and Postwar Mobility: 1946-1958"/&gt;
Italian designer [[Piaggio]] introduced the [[Vespa]] in 1946, which experienced immediate and widespread popularity. Imports from the UK, Italy and Germany, thus found a niche in US markets that American bikes did not fill.

The [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA Group]] purchased Triumph Motorcycles in 1951 to become the largest producer of motorcycles in the world claiming "one in four".{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} The German [[NSU Motorenwerke AG|NSU]] was the largest manufacturer from 1955{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} until 1959 when [[Honda]] became the largest manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cases in contemporary strategy analysis |first1= Robert M. |last1= Grant |first2= Kent E. |last2= Neupert |edition= 3rd |publisher= [[Wiley-Blackwell]] |year= 2003 |isbn= 1-4051-1180-1 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XF7V9w8ByrcC&amp;pg=PA172 |accessdate= 2010-11-12 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

[[File:ZweiRadMuseumNSU Triumph Bonneville.JPG|thumb|A 1962 Triumph Bonneville represents the popularity of British motorcycles at that time]]
British manufacturers Triumph, BSA, and [[Norton (motorcycle)|Norton]] retained a dominant position in some markets until the rise of the Japanese manufacturers, led by Honda, in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The role of the motorcycle shifted in the 1960s, from the tool of a life to a toy of a lifestyle. It became part of an image, of status, a cultural icon for individualism, a prop in Hollywood B-movies.&lt;ref name="An overview of the British motorcycle industry and its collapse"/&gt;

The motorcycle also became a recreational machine for sport and leisure, a vehicle for carefree youth, not essential transportation for the mature family man or woman, and the Japanese were able to produce modern designs more quickly, more cheaply, and of better quality than their competitors. Their motorbikes were more stylish and more reliable, so the British manufacturers fell behind as mass-market producers.

Honda, which was officially founded in Japan on September 24, 1948, introduced their [[SOHC]] [[inline-four engine]] [[Honda CB750|CB750]] in 1969, which was inexpensive and immediately successful.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} It established the across-the-frame-four engine configuration as a design with huge potential for power and performance. Shortly after the introduction of the SOHC, Kawasaki demonstrated the potential of the four-stroke four-cylinder engine with the introduction of the [[Kawasaki Z1|KZ900]].

[[Suzuki]], [[Kawasaki motorcycles|Kawasaki]] and the [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] each started producing motorcycles in the 1950s. Meanwhile, the sun was setting on British dominion over the big-displacement motorbike market.

===Japanese dominance===
[[File:Honda CB750a.JPG|thumb|The [[Honda CB750]] revolutionized motorcycle marketing and was emblematic of Japanese dominance]]
The excellence of Japanese motorcycles caused similar effects in all Western markets: many Italian bike firms either went bust or only just managed to survive. As a result, BMW's worldwide sales sagged in the 1960s, but came back strongly with the introduction of a completely redesigned [[BMW R75/5|"slash-5"]] series for model year 1970.

From the 1960s through the 1990s, small two-stroke motorcycles were popular worldwide, partly as a result of the pioneering work of the [[East German]] Daniel Zimmermann (rotary disc valve) and [[MZ Motorrad- und Zweiradwerk|MZ]]'s Walter Kaaden who developed the two-stroke expansion chamber in the 1950s. These ideas were taken up by Suzuki when [[Ernst Degner]], the MZ engineer and rider, defected to the West on 13 September 1961 after retiring from the 125cc Swedish Grand Prix at Kristianstad. Degner, an excellent engineer, immediately joined Suzuki and his knowledge became their technology springboard.

[[Harley-Davidson]] in the US at the time suffered from the same problems as the European firms, but its unique product range, American tariff laws and nationalism-driven customer loyalty allowed it to survive. One alleged flaw, however, was retaining the characteristic Harley-Davidson 45° [[V-twin|engine vee-angle]], which causes [[Engine balance|excess vibration]] as well as the loping Harley-Davidson sound.

A factory full fairing was introduced by BMW motorcycle in the R100RS of 1977, the first factory fairing produced in quantity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/motorcycle-reviews/2008-01-01/bmw-r100rs.aspx|title=1977 BMW R100RS |publisher=Motorcycle Classics|accessdate=2009-08-10|date=January–February 2008|author=Bill Stermer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, BMW stimulated the "adventure touring" category of motorcycling with its [[dual-sport motorcycle|dual-sport]] model, the [[BMW R80G/S|R80G/S]]. In 1988, BMW was the first motorcycle manufacturer to introduce [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock-brakes (ABS)]] on its sporting K100RS-SE and K1 models.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==The present==
[[File:ZX-7RR Wikepedia.jpg|thumb|left|A 2004 [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] ZX-7RR]]
Today the Japanese manufacturers, Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and Yamaha dominate the large motorcycle industry, although [[Harley-Davidson]] still maintains a high degree of popularity, particularly in the United States.

Recent years have seen a resurgence in the popularity around the world of many other motorcycle brands, including BMW, Triumph and [[Ducati]], and the emergence of [[Victory Motorcycles|Victory]] as a second successful mass-builder of big-twin American cruisers.

In November 2006, the Dutch company E.V.A. Products BV Holland announced that the first commercially available [[Diesel motorcycle|diesel-powered motorcycle]], its Track T-800CDI, achieved production status.&lt;ref name="The first commercially-available diesel motorcycle"&gt;{{cite web | title=The first commercially-available diesel motorcycle | work=www.Gizmag.com (November 20, 2006) | url=http://www.gizmag.com/go/6493/ | accessdate=2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Track T-800CDI uses an 800&amp;nbsp;cc three-cylinder Daimler Chrysler diesel engine. However, other manufacturers, including Royal Enfield, had been producing diesel-powered bikes since at least 1965.&lt;ref name="Diesel motorbikes"&gt;{{cite web | title=Diesel motorbikes | work=Journey to Forever | url=http://journeytoforever.org/biodiesel_bikes.html | accessdate=2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the developing world===
[[File:Scooters Bangkok Nana.jpg|thumb|Motorcycle traffic in [[Bangkok]]]]
There is a large demand for small, cheap motorcycles in the developing world, and many of the firms meeting that demand now also compete in mature markets, such as China's [[Hongdou (company)|Hongdou]] which makes a version of Honda's venerable [[Honda CG125|CG125]].&lt;ref name="Hongdou Group: Manufacturer &amp; Exporter . . ."&gt;{{cite web | title=Hongdou Group: Manufacturer &amp; Exporter . . . | work=International Department, Hongdou Motorcycle Co.

'''Hydrogen darkening''' is a physical degradation of the [[Glass#Optical properties|optical properties]] of [[glass]]. Free hydrogen atoms are able to bind to the SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[silica]] glass compound forming [[hydroxyl]] (OH)—a chemical compound that interferes with the passage of light through the glass.

The problem is particularly relevant to [[fiber optic cable]]s—particularly in oil and gas wells where fiber optic cables are used for [[distributed temperature sensing]]. Hydrogen can be present due to the [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] of [[hydrocarbon]]s in the well.  The darkening of the fiber can distort the DTS reading and possibly render the DTS system inoperable due to the [[optical loss budget]] being exceeded.

To prevent this, coatings such as [[carbon]] are applied to the fiber, and hydrogen capturing gels are used to buffer the fiber, and other proprietary techniques may be used to prevent hydrogen atoms from reaching the glass fiber via the [[cable sheath]].

==Tales and myths of impalement==

===Europe===

====Vampires and other undead====
The idea that the vampire "can ''only'' be slain with a stake driven through its heart" has been pervasive in European fiction. Examples such as Bram Stoker's [[Dracula]] and the more recent [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy The Vampire Slayer]] and [[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]] series' all incorporate that idea.&lt;ref&gt;For popularity claim and example:[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2155602/Vampire-skeletons-impaled-iron-stakes-say-arent-just-film-fantasy.html Thought vampires were just film fantasy? Skeletons impaled on iron stakes say otherwise]&lt;/ref&gt; In classic European folklore, it was believed that one method, ''among several'', to "kill" a [[vampire]], or prevent a corpse from rising as a vampire, was to drive a wooden stake through the heart before interment.&lt;ref&gt;''Barber'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In one story, an [[Istria]]n peasant named [[Jure Grando]] died and was buried in 1656. It was believed that he returned as a vampire, and at least one villager tried to drive a stake through his heart, but failed in the attempt. Finally, in 1672, the corpse was [[decapitation|decapitated]], and the vampire terror was put to rest.&lt;ref&gt;''Caron'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Eastern European, in particular Slavic (but also Roumanian), conception of the vampire as an undead creature in which impaling it was central to either destroying it, or at least immobilizing it, is the most well-known European tradition, such traditions can also be found elsewhere in Europe. In Greece, the troublesome undead were usually called a [[vrykolakas]]. The archaeologist Susan-Marie Cronkite&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elementshealthspace.com/masthead/ Bio on Cronkite]&lt;/ref&gt; describes an odd grave found at [[Mytilene]], at [[Lesbos]], a find the archeologists connected with the vrykolakas superstition.&lt;ref&gt;''Cronkite''(2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norse [[draugr]], or haugbui (mound-dweller), was a type of undead typically (but not exclusively) associated with those put (supposedly) to rest in burial mounds/[[tumulus|tumuli]]. The approved methods of killing a draugr are "to sever his head from his body and set the same beneath his rump, or impale his body with a stake or burn it to ashes".&lt;ref&gt;''Andrews'' (1913), p.603. Several examples in the essay on grave robbery and encounters with draugr there and elsewhere&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in modern vampiric lore, the stake is regarded as a very effective tool against the undead, people in pre-modern Europe could have their doubts. [[Edward Payson Evans]] tells the following story, from the city [[Kadaň]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Evans'' (1906), [https://books.google.com/books?id=delFlcGFniYC&amp;pg=PA196 p.196]&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|In 1337, a herdsman near the town of Cadan came forth from his grave every night, visiting the villages, terrifying the inhabitants, conversing affably with some and murdering others. Every person, with whom he associated, was doomed to die within eight days and to wander as a vampire after death. In order to keep him in his grave, a stake was driven through his body, but he only laughed at this clumsy attempt to impale a ghost, saying: "You have really rendered me a great service by providing me with a staff, with which to ward off dogs when I go out to walk"}}

====Literary treatment of impalement====
A graphic description of the vertical impalement of a Serbian rebel by Ottoman authorities can be found in [[Ivo Andrić]]'s novel ''[[The Bridge on the Drina]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt of impalement in book can be accessed here: [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Bridge+on+the+Drina+%28excerpts%29.-a0165021314 The Bridge on the Drina]&lt;/ref&gt; Andrić was later awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] for the whole of his literary contribution, though this novel was the ''magnum opus''.&lt;ref&gt;On status as Nobel Laureate, predominantly on basis of Bridge, see: [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/books/a-reader-s-guide-to-the-balkans.html A Reader's Guide to the Balkans]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anecdotes of the impaled====
Some anecdotes of the behavior and fates of the impaled remain which, if true, would be unique in the history of impalement. The first was narrated as a proof of the efficacy of praying to [[Saint Barbara]]. In the woods of Bohemia around 1552, there was a robber band roaming, plundering and murdering innocent travelers. A manhunt was organized, and the robber chief was apprehended and sentenced to be impaled. While one of his associates, likewise impaled, swiftly expired, the chief was not so lucky.
All day long, he writhed on his stake, begging to be killed, but all in vain. That night, in his despair, he prayed to St. Barbara that he was truly sorry for all his evil doings in life and that all he hoped for was to reconcile with God and to be graced with a good death. Seemingly in response, the man's stake broke, and with great effort and pain, he managed to ''de-impale'' himself. Crawling along, he came to a house, and his cries of help were heard. He was helped into a bed, and a priest was sent for. The former robber chief then gave his death bed confession, grieving over his misspent life, but properly grateful to God and St. Barbara. He then died in peace, his hands folded over his chest.&lt;ref&gt;''Vierholz'' (1737) [https://books.google.com/books?id=jrY_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA493 p.&amp;nbsp;493–95]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another incident, which was, allegedly, partially witnessed by the editor of a "Ladies' Journal", is said to have occurred in Wallachia in the 1770s. He had been present in [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] when 27 robbers had been impaled. It was strictly forbidden to give the impaled persons any water, but one woman took mercy on one of the robbers, and fetched water for him in a kettle. As she was glancing anxiously about to check if anyone took notice of her forbidden act of mercy, the robber smashed her head in with the kettle, killing her on the spot. The editor avers he was present when the robber was asked why he had done such a thing, and he merely replied he had done it on a whim, and just had felt like killing her then and there.&lt;ref&gt;''Damengesellschaft'' (1785) [https://books.google.com/books?id=3pMSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA95 p.&amp;nbsp;95–97]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americas===
In [[British Columbia]], a folk tale from the [[Lillooet people|Lillooet People]] is preserved in which impalement occurs as a central element. A man became suspicious of his wife because she went out each day to gather roots and cedar-bark but hardly ever brought anything home. One day, he spied on her, and discovered that she was cavorting with Lynx, rather than doing her wifely duties. The next day, he asked to accompany her, and they went out in the forest, and came at last to a very tall tree. The man climbed to the top of it, the wife following. The jealous man then sharpened the top of the tree with his knife, and impaled his wife on it. On his way down, he removed the bark of the tree, so it became slick. The woman cried out her pain and her brothers heard her. They and animals they called to help them tried to rescue her, but the stem was too slick for them to climb up to reach her. Then Snail offered to help her, and slowly crawled up the tree. But alas, Snail moved too slowly, and by the time it took him to reach the top of the tree, the woman was dead.&lt;ref&gt;The brothers later on revenged themselves on the husband, through a clever ruse. ''Teit'' (1912), p. 339–40&lt;/ref&gt;

Among tribes living around the [[Titicaca]], tales circulated in the sixteenth century that prior to the [[Incas]], a mysterious group of white men lived there, and their banishment was somehow connected with the birth of the Sun. A sixteenth century tale collected by a Spanish missionary tells of such an individual, called Tanupa or Taapac, who was impaled by other Indians around the Titicaca, and a shrine was set up there to commemorate the events.&lt;ref&gt;''Bandelier'' (1904), impalement incident at p.224&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martyrdom of al-Hallaj===
The renowned Sufi mystic was in AD 922 to be impaled for blasphemy in Baghdad, for having said such things as "I am God". However, the executioners were unable to do so, because al-Hallaj floated in the air just above their reach. Then, al-Hallaj's spirit ascended to Heaven, and conversed with Muhammed, the Prophet of Islam, and al-Hallaj asked the Prophet if he should let himself be impaled. The Prophet acknowledged that al-Hallaj's spiritual state was so heightened that his utterance "I am God" was both just and true, but that for the sake of ordinary people, he should let himself be impaled, because their spiritual state was such that they would be mislead from practical religion if they were to believe in such sayings like "I am God". And thus, for the sake of preserving the religion of ordinary people, al-Hallaj let himself be impaled at last.&lt;ref&gt;Lit.Soc. Bombay (1819), [https://books.google.com/books?id=12soAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA111 p. 111–113]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orientalism===
Tales and anecdotes concerning how dreadfully swift and harsh Ottoman justice was for comparatively trivial offenses abound. [[Dimitrie Cantemir]], a Moldavian noble living in Constantinople at the end of the 17th century, and often engaged in pleas of cases towards Ottoman authorities, narrates a tale from the building of a great mosque there in 1461. The Greek architect was amply rewarded by the sultan, so that a whole street was privileged to the Greek populace in recognition of his efforts. However, some asked the architect if he could even build a greater and more beautiful mosque than the one completed. Incautiously, the architect said sure enough, if I were given the materials. The sultan, upon hearing this, was so fearful that his successors might create an even more beautiful mosque than his own, that just in case, he chose to impale the architect to deprive successors of that genius, commemorating the event by erecting a huge iron spike in the middle of the mosque. Not even bothering to refute this tale of impalement, Cantemir says that he ''does'', however, believe in the grand gift of the street, because he had used the original charter from the sultan to protect the Greek interest when somebody wanted to deprive the Greeks of the privilege. Cantemir won his case.&lt;ref&gt;''Cantemir'' (1734), [https://books.google.com/books?id=q3NUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA109 p.109]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1632, under [[Murad IV]] (r.1623–40), a hapless interpreter in a fierce dispute between the French ambassador and Ottoman authorities was impaled alive for faithfully translating the insolent words of the ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;The French had been accused of bringing a Muslim woman on board a ship, ''Browne'' (1751) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=248&amp;id=XjYLAAAAYAAJ p.248]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Murad IV sought to ban the use of tobacco, and reportedly impaled alive a man and a woman for breaking the law, the one for selling tobacco, the other for using it.&lt;ref&gt;''Sherwood, Jones'' (1825) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=722&amp;id=8esTAAAAIAAJ p.722]&lt;/ref&gt; Another such anecdote, is said to have occurred in 1695 under [[Mustafa II]]: The Grand Vizier prevented access to the sultan to a poor shoemaker who had a petition for his sovereign. Once the sultan learnt of it, he promptly ordered the Grand Vizier to be impaled, although the Grand Vizier was the son of the sultan's favourite concubine.&lt;ref&gt;''Percy'' (1825), [https://books.google.com/books?id=E0k4AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA147 p.147]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian sub-continent===
In the Hindu [[Draupadi]] cult, impalement of animals, demons, and humans is a recurring motif within legends and symbolic re-enactments during holidays/festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alf Hiltebeitel]] (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=diPh4qYtjPUC The Cult of Draupadi]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a [[Shaivite]] story from India, under the old [[Pandyan Dynasty]], ruling from 500 BC-1500 CE, the 7th century King [[Koon Pandiyan]] had 8000 [[Jainism|Jains]] [[Impalement of the Jains in Madurai|impaled in Madurai]]. Some historians regard the story as a legend rather than historically accurate, and that it might have been created by the Shaivites to prove their superiority over the Jains.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sastri|1976|p=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Roy|1984|loc=chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act, legendary or not, is still commemorated in "lurid mural representations" in several Hindu temples in Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Paul Dundas|Dundas]]'' (1992) [https://books.google.com/books?id=5ialKAbIyV4C p.127] The author mentions as an example the temple to the war god [[Murugan]] in [[Kalugumalai]]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such depictions in temples can be found in the [[Meenakshi Amman Temple]] in [[Madurai]], around the holy tank enclosure to the shrine of [[Meenakshi]]. There, a long line of impaled Jaines are depicted, with dogs at their feet, licking up the blood, and crows flying around to pick out their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;''AES'' (1904), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ybyzrkuQaUEC&amp;pg=PA52 p.52]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Representations of impaled members of a different religion than Hinduism seems not to be confined to the Jains, but also to Buddhists. In a temple at Trivatur, not far from Madras (present name [[Chennai]]), for example, the walls "are covered with sculptures representing the execution of Buddhists by the most horrible tortures, the martyrs being impaled alive and left to be devoured by dogs and birds of prey." ''Elliot'' (1869), [https://books.google.com/books?id=NRISAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA109 p.109] This presumably commemorates an alleged persecution of Buddhists in the 2nd century BC under Hindu King [[Pushyamitra Shunga]], as narrated, for example, in 2nd century AD text [[Ashokavadana]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bengal, tales existed about a foolish king in the [[Pala Empire]], Bhava Chandra, and his equally foolish minister. They are a pair not unlike the [[Wise Men of Gotham]], bereft of common sense as a result of a curse laid upon them. In their last judgment, they had condemned two robbers to be impaled, but when the robbers began quarreling about who should get impaled on the longest pole, Bhava Chandra and his minister became deeply intrigued. The robbers told them that whoever died on the longest pole would be reincarnated as the ruler of the Earth, while the other would become his minister. Thinking it unseemly that two mere robbers should gain such a high position in their next life, Bhava Chandra chose to impale himself on the longest pole, while his minister happily chose to die on the shorter.&lt;ref&gt;''[[William Wilson Hunter|Hunter]]'' (1875) [https://archive.org/details/astatisticalacc00unkngoog p.313]&lt;/ref&gt;

The remains of persons impaled have, occasionally, been thought imbued with certain magical properties. For example, the [[Arthashastra]] states that if one wishes to make a fire at one place, and prevent any other fire to be lit there, one could make that fire "by the friction of a black-and-white bamboo stick on the rib bone of the left side of a man who has been slain with a sword, or impaled". Virginia Saunders also mentions from the same text how to become invisible:&lt;ref&gt;''Saunders'' (1922), p.422&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Or if invisibility is desired, having fasted three nights one should, on the day of the star Pushya, sprinkle with the milk of goats and sheep, barley planted in soil placed in the skull of a man who has been killed by a sword or has been impaled.}}
The [[Asceticism|ascetic]] [[Mandavya]], when he was five years old, had amused himself with sticking a reed into a living locust. Lord [[Yama]], the god of death, bided his time to exact what he thought was a proper punishment. As an old man, Mandavya was sitting outside his cave in deep meditation, oblivious to some thieves placing their stolen goods there. Wrongfully believing Mandavya had stolen the goods, the authorities placed Mandavya on trial. He could not answer the judge on how the goods had come to be in his hermitage, so the king declared he was to be impaled. Mandavya seemed unperturbed by the whole affair, and when he was still alive, in deep contemplation, on the stake after 4 years, the king declared Mandavya had to be innocent, and ordered him pulled down. However, the stake broke inside Mandavya's body, and the excruciating pain destroyed Mandavya's trance. In deep bitterness, he asked the gods how he had deserved such a fate, and Yama answered it was because of the locust he had tortured as a young boy. Mandavya became infuriated at Yama and pointed out how disproportionate the punishment had been. He then cursed Yama to be born as a human being, namely as [[Vidura]], the son of a mere serving maid.&lt;ref&gt;Combined from two slightly variant accounts, ''Ward'' (1824), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GlIqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA294 p. 294–95] and ''Garbe'' (1913), p. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt;

A tale from [[Kashmir]] of reincarnation after death on the stake concerns the sage Samdhimati. Samdhimati was minister under King Jayendra, when a mysterious prophecy spread through the populace: "To Samdhimati will belong the kingdom". Jayendra, on hearing of this, threw Samdhimati in prison for 10 years. When the king was on his death bed, he was unwilling to let Samdhimati have the prophecy fulfilled, so he ordered Samdhimati impaled. When Samdhimati's guru Isana heard of this, he went to the cemetery where Samhimati was impaled in order to perform the proper funeral rites. The wolves had devoured all the flesh of the body, and Isana was amazed that the prophecy was inscribed on Samdhimati's skull that he was to inherit the kingdom. Keeping watch, one night Isana saw the graveyard was filled with [[Yogini]]s (female mystics/witches). The Yoginis were drunk and "lustful for a man", and provided the skeleton with flesh (not the least, a penis) from their own bodies. They then captured Samdhimati's spirit, which was still hovering around, within the fleshed skeleton, and "spent the rest of the night sporting with him". As dawn approached, Isana, afraid that Samdhimati's new body should be dissolved by the witches, rushed out from his hiding place, and chased them away. In his new body and life, Samdhimati became known as [[Aryaraja]], and was, indeed, crowned as King of Kashmir, thereby fulfilling the prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;''Brown'' (1919), p. 425–26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Asia===
In the Buddhist conception of the eight Hells, as [[John Bowring]] relates from [[Siam]], those consigned for the Sixth Hell are impaled on spits and roasted. When well roasted, enormous dogs with iron teeth devour them. But, the damned are reborn, and must relive this punishment for 16000 years, over and over again&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;''Bowring'' (1857) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=306&amp;id=7tTzwqKN9RIC p.306]&lt;/ref&gt; Another tale popular in Siam was about [[Devadatta]], a wily antagonist to [[Buddha]] seeking to undermine [[Gautama]]'s position among his followers. For this crime, Devadatta was sent off into the very deepest Hell, the [[Avici]], being impaled on three great iron spears in a sea of flames.&lt;ref&gt;''Bowring'' (1857) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=313&amp;id=7tTzwqKN9RIC p.313] For rather similar, vivid depictions of the sufferings in Hell from Buddhist temples in [[Cambodia]], see ''Vincent Jr.'' (1878), p.237&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illusions of impalement==
The 1980 Italian film, ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'', directed by [[Ruggero Deodato]], graphically depicts impalement.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite interview |last=Deodato |first=Ruggero |subjectlink=Ruggero Deodato |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]]; [[Bob Murawski]] |title=Cult-Con 2000 |location=Tarrytown, New York |date=2000-11-12 |work=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story follows a rescue party searching for a missing documentary film crew in the [[Amazon Rainforest]].&lt;ref name=sergio&gt;{{cite video | people = D'Offizi, Sergio (interviewee) |date = 2003 | title = In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | medium = Documentary | location = Italy | publisher = Alan Young Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's depiction of indigenous tribes, death of animals on set, and the graphic violence (notably the impalement scene) brought on a great deal of controversy, legal investigations, boycotts and protests by concerned social groups, bans in many countries (some of which are still in effect), and heavy censorship in countries where it has not been banned.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.refused-classification.com/Films_C.htm#cannibalholocaust | title=Films C | publisher=Refused-Classification.com | accessdate=2007-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impalement scene was so realistic, that Deodato was charged with murder at one point. Deodato had to produce evidence that the "impaled" actress was alive in the aftermath of the scene, and had to further explain how the [[special effect]] was done: the actress sat on a [[bicycle seat]] mounted to a pole while she looked up and held a short stake of [[balsa]] wood in her mouth. The charges were dropped.&lt;ref name=sergio/&gt;

In stage magic, the ''[[Impaled (illusion)|illusion of impalement]]'' is a popular feat of magic that appears to be an act of impalement.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: [http://www.wellingtonent.com/products/impaled.html Impaled]&lt;/ref&gt; Impaling tricks are not, however, a modern European invention, and some [[dervish]] orders performed such acts already in the 18th century. [[Carsten Niebuhr]], traveling the Middle East 1761–67 on a Danish funded expedition, saw such a display at [[Basra]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Pinkerton'' (1811), [https://books.google.com/books?id=HWEOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA172 p.172]&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|"The scene was in the open air, and in the court of the mosque, which was illuminated with only three lamps. Several Mullahs and dervises began with singing some passages out of the Koran. They continued to sing, with the accompaniment of some drums; and, during the music, the other dervises arose, took the sharp pointed irons, and did as if they were piercing their bodies, and even driving the irons with mallets into their flesh. Next appeared the principal actor, who, assuming an air of inspiration, directed the music to proceed, and to be raised to higher animation, in, order to assist his enthusiasm, or rather to stun the ears of the spectators. In his extacy, he threw up his turban in the air, loosened his hair; for this order of dervises wear their hair; and pierced his body with five lances: then mounting upon a low building, upon which a pole, sixteen feet long, and shod with a sharp iron point, had been set up, he impaled himself upon the pole, and was carried in this condition through the square. It was an affecting sight, to see a lean man, with a long beard, and dishevelled hair, wounded all over with spikes, and then carried about spitted upon a pole. I said, as I went away, to a Mullah of my acquaintance, that the dervise performed his tricks by means of a broad belt which he carried in his long wide drawers. The Mullah replied, that he had suspected some such art, but avoided mentioning his suspicions, lest he might draw upon himself the enmity of the order of [[Sheikh Bedreddin|Bed-reddin]]; for that one of his brethren had experienced great persecution from those dervises, in consequence of presuming to hint his doubts of the reality of their miracles."}}

In engineering, an '''influence line''' graphs the variation of a function (such as the shear felt in a structure member) at a specific point on a [[Beam (structure)|beam]] or [[truss]] caused by a unit load placed at any point along the structure.&lt;ref name="onlinefreeebooks"&gt;Kharagpur.

Influence lines are important in designing beams and trusses used in [[Bridge|bridges]], crane rails, [[conveyor belt]]s, floor girders, and other structures where loads will move along their span.&lt;ref name="Hibbeler"/&gt; The influence lines show where a load will create the maximum effect for any of the functions studied.

Influence lines are both [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] and [[additive map|additive]].&lt;ref name="Hibbeler"/&gt; This means that they can be used even when the load that will be applied is not a unit load or if there are multiple loads applied. To find the effect of any non-unit load on a structure, the ordinate results obtained by the influence line are multiplied by the magnitude of the actual load to be applied. The entire influence line can be scaled, or just the maximum and minimum effects experienced along the line. The scaled maximum and minimum are the critical magnitudes that must be designed for in the beam or truss.

In cases where multiple loads may be in effect, the influence lines for the individual loads may be added together in order to obtain the total effect felt by the structure at a given point. When adding the influence lines together, it is necessary to include the appropriate offsets due to the spacing of loads across the structure. For example,  a truck load is applied to the structure. Rear axle, B, is three feet behind front axle, A, then the effect of A at ''x'' feet along the structure must be added to the effect of B at (''x'' – 3) feet along the structure—not the effect of B at ''x'' feet along the structure.

Many loads are distributed rather than concentrated. Influence lines can be used with either concentrated or distributed loadings. For a concentrated (or point) load, a unit point load is moved along the structure. For a distributed load of a given width, a unit-distributed load of the same width is moved along the structure, noting that as the load nears the ends and moves off the structure only part of the total load is carried by the structure. The effect of the distributed unit load can also be obtained by integrating the point load’s influence line over the corresponding length of the structures.

==Demonstration from Betti's theorem==
Influence lines are based on [[Betti's theorem]].  From there, consider two external force systems, &lt;math&gt;F^P_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F^Q_i&lt;/math&gt;, each one associated with a displacement field whose displacements measured in the force's point of application are represented by &lt;math&gt;d^P_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d^Q_i&lt;/math&gt;.

Consider that the &lt;math&gt;F^P_i&lt;/math&gt; system represents actual forces applied to the structure, which are in equilibrium.  Consider that the &lt;math&gt;F^Q_i&lt;/math&gt; system is formed by a single force, &lt;math&gt;F^Q&lt;/math&gt;.  The displacement field &lt;math&gt;d^Q_i&lt;/math&gt; associated with this forced is defined by releasing the structural restraints acting on the point where &lt;math&gt;F^Q&lt;/math&gt; is applied and imposing a relative unit displacement which is kinematically admissible in the negative direction, represented as &lt;math&gt;d^Q_1 = -1&lt;/math&gt;.  From [[Betti's theorem]], we obtain the following result:

&lt;math&gt;
-F^P_1 + \sum^n_{i=2}F^P_id^Q_i = F^Q\times 0 \iff F^P_1 = \sum^n_{i=2}F^P_id^Q_i
&lt;/math&gt;

==Concept==
When designing a beam or truss, it is necessary to design for the scenarios causing the maximum expected reactions, shears, and moments within the structure members in order to ensure that no member will fail during the life of the structure. When dealing with [[dead and live loads|dead loads]] (loads that never move, such as the weight of the structure itself), this is relatively easy because the loads are easy to predict and plan for. For [[dead and live loads|live loads]] (any load that will be moved during the life of the structure, such as furniture and people), it becomes much harder to predict where the loads will be or how concentrated or distributed they will be throughout the life of the structure.

Influence lines graph the response of a beam or truss as a unit load travels across it. The influence line allows the designers to discover quickly where to place a live load in order to calculate the maximum resulting response for each of the following functions:  reaction, shear, or moment. The designer can then scale the influence line by the greatest expected load to calculate the maximum response of each function for which the beam or truss must be designed.
Influence lines can also be used to find the responses of other functions (such as deflection or axial force) to the applied unit load, but these uses of influence lines are less common.

==Methods for constructing influence lines==
There are three methods used for constructing the influence line. The first is to tabulate the influence values for multiple points along the structure, then use those points to create the influence line.&lt;ref name="Hibbeler"/&gt; The second is to determine the influence-line equations that apply to the structure, thereby solving for all points along the influence line in terms of ''x'', where ''x'' is the number of feet from the start of the structure to the point where the unit load is applied.&lt;ref name="onlinefreeebooks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iastate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theconstructor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foundationcoalition"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hibbeler"/&gt;  The third method is called the [[Müller-Breslau's principle]]. It creates a [[qualitative data|qualitative]] influence line.&lt;ref name="onlinefreeebooks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iastate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hibbeler"/&gt; This influence line will still provide the designer with an accurate idea of where the unit load will produce the largest response of a function at the point being studied, but it cannot be used directly to calculate what the magnitude that response will be, whereas the influence lines produced by the first two methods can.

===Tabulate values===
In order to tabulate the influence values with respect to some point A on the structure, a unit load must be placed at various points along the structure. [[Statics]] is used to calculate what the value of the function (reaction, shear, or moment) is at point A. Typically an upwards reaction is seen as positive. Shear and moments are given positive or negative values according to the same conventions used for [[shear and moment diagram]]s.

R. C. Hibbeler states, in his book ''Structural Analysis'', “All statically determinate beams will have influence lines that consist of straight line segments.”&lt;ref name="Hibbeler"/&gt; Therefore, it is possible to minimize the number of computations by recognizing the points that will cause a change in the slope of the influence line and only calculating the values at those points. The slope of the inflection line can change at supports, mid-spans, and joints.

An influence line for a given function, such as a reaction, axial force, shear force, or bending moment, is a graph that shows the variation of that function at any given point on a structure due to the application of a unit load at any point on the structure.

An influence line for a function differs from a shear, axial, or bending moment diagram. Influence lines can be generated by independently applying a unit load at several points on a structure and determining the value of the function due to this load, i.e. shear, axial, and moment at the desired location. The calculated values for each function are then plotted where the load was applied and then connected together to generate the influence line for the function.

Once the influence values have been tabulated, the influence line for the function at point A can be drawn in terms of ''x''. First, the tabulated values must be located. For the sections in between the tabulated points, interpolation is required. Therefore, straight lines may be drawn to connect the points. Once this is done, the influence line is complete.

===Influence-line equations===
It is possible to create equations defining the influence line across the entire span of a structure. This is done by solving for the reaction, shear, or moment at the point A caused by a unit load placed at ''x'' feet along the structure instead of a specific distance. This method is similar to the tabulated values method, but rather than obtaining a numeric solution, the outcome is an equation in terms of ''x''.&lt;ref name="Hibbeler"/&gt;

It is important to understanding where the slope of the influence line changes for this method because the influence-line equation will change for each linear section of the influence line. Therefore, the complete equation will be a [[piecewise linear function]] which has a separate influence-line equation for each linear section of the influence line.&lt;ref name="Hibbeler"/&gt;

=== Müller-Breslau's Principle===
According to www.public.iastate.edu, “[[Muller-Breslau's principle|The Müller-Breslau Principle]] can be utilized to draw [[qualitative data|qualitative]] influence lines, which are directly proportional to the actual influence line.”&lt;ref name="iastate"/&gt;  Instead of moving a unit load along a beam, the Müller-Breslau Principle finds the deflected shape of the beam caused by first releasing the beam at the point being studied, and then applying the function (reaction, shear, or moment) being studied to that point. The principle states that the influence line of a function will have a scaled shape that is the same as the deflected shape of the beam when the beam is acted upon by the function.

In order to understand how the beam will deflect under the function, it is necessary to remove the beam’s capacity to resist the function. Below are explanations of how to find the influence lines of a simply supported, rigid beam (such as the one displayed in Figure 1).

:* When determining the reaction caused at a support, the support is replaced with a roller, which cannot resist a vertical reaction.&lt;ref name="iastate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hibbeler"/&gt; Then an upward (positive) reaction is applied to the point where the support was. Since the support has been removed, the beam will rotate upwards, and since the beam is rigid, it will create a triangle with the point at the second support. If the beam extends beyond the second support as a cantilever, a similar triangle will be formed below the cantilevers position. This means that the reaction’s influence line will be a straight, sloping line with a value of zero at the location of the second support.

:* When determining the shear caused at some point B along the beam, the beam must be cut and a roller-guide (which is able to resist moments but not shear) must be inserted at point B.&lt;ref name="iastate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hibbeler"/&gt; Then, by applying a positive shear to that point, it can be seen that the left side will rotate down, but the right side will rotate up. This creates a discontinuous influence line which reaches zero at the supports and whose slope is equal on either side of the discontinuity. If point B is at a support, then the deflection between point B and any other supports will still create a triangle, but if the beam is cantilevered, then the entire cantilevered side will move up or down creating a rectangle.

:* When determining the moment caused by at some point B along the beam, a hinge will be placed at point B, releasing it to moments but resisting shear.&lt;ref name="iastate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hibbeler"/&gt; Then when a positive moment is placed at point B, both sides of the beam will rotate up. This will create a continuous influence line, but the slopes will be equal and opposite on either side of the hinge at point B. Since the beam is simply supported, its end supports (pins) cannot resist moment; therefore, it can be observed that the supports will never experience moments in a static situation regardless of where the load is placed.

The Müller-Breslau Principle can only produce qualitative influence lines.&lt;ref name="iastate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hibbeler"/&gt; This means that engineers can use it to determine where to place a load to incur the maximum of a function, but the magnitude of that maximum cannot be calculated from the influence line. Instead, the engineer must use statics to solve for the functions value in that loading case.

==Alternate loading cases==

===Multiple loads===
The simplest loading case is a single point load, but influence lines can also be used to determine responses due to multiple loads and distributed loads. Sometimes it is known that multiple loads will occur at some fixed distance apart. For example, on a bridge the wheels of cars or trucks create point loads that act at relatively standard distances.

In order to calculate the response of a function to all of these point loads using an influence line, the results found with the influence line can be scaled for each load, and then the scaled magnitudes can be summed to find the total response that the structure must withstand.&lt;ref name="Hibbeler"/&gt; The point loads can have different magnitudes themselves, but even if they apply the same force to the structure, it will be necessary to scale them separately because they act at different distances along the structure. For example, if a car's wheels are 10 feet apart, then when the first set is 13 feet onto the bridge, the second set will be only 3 feet onto the bridge. If the first set of wheels is 7 feet onto the bridge, the second set has not yet reached the bridge, and therefore only the first set is placing a load on the bridge.

Also, if, between two loads, one of the loads is heavier, the loads must be examined in both loading orders (the larger load on the right and the larger load on the left) to ensure that the maximum load is found. If there are three or more loads, then the number of cases to be examined will increase.

===Distributed loads===
Many loads do not act as point loads, but instead act over an extended length or area as distributed loads. For example, a tractor with [[continuous track]]s will apply a load distributed over the length of each track.

In order to find the effect of a distributed load, the designer can integrate an influence line, found using a point load, over the affected distance of the structure.&lt;ref name="Hibbeler"/&gt; For example, if a three-foot-long track acts between 5 feet and 8 feet along a beam, the influence line of that beam must be integrated between 5 and 8 feet. The integration of the influence line gives the effect that would be felt if the distributed load had a unit magnitude. Therefore, after integrating, the designer must still scale the results to get the actual effect of the distributed load.

==Indeterminate structures==
While the influence lines of statically determinate structures (as mentioned above) are made up of straight line segments, the same is not true for indeterminate structures. Indeterminate structures are not considered rigid; therefore, the influence lines drawn for them will not be straight lines but rather curves. The methods above can still be used to determine the influence lines for the structure, but the work becomes much more complex as the properties of the beam itself must be taken into consideration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7493">'''Information foraging''' is a theory that applies the ideas from [[optimal foraging theory]] to understand how human users search for information. The theory is based on the assumption that, when searching for information, humans use "built-in" foraging mechanisms that evolved to help our animal ancestors find food.  Importantly, better understanding of human search behaviour can improve the usability of websites or any other user interface.

==History of the theory==

In the 1970s [[optimal foraging theory]] was developed by [[anthropology|anthropologists]] and [[ecology|ecologists]] to explain how animals hunt for food. It suggested that the eating habits of animals revolve around maximizing [[energy]] intake over a given amount of time. For every [[predation|predator]], certain prey are worth pursuing, while others would result in a net loss of energy.

In the early 1990s, [[Peter Pirolli]] and [[Stuart Card]] from [[PARC (company)|PARC]] noticed the similarities between users' information searching patterns and animal food foraging strategies.  Working together with [[psychology|psychologists]] to analyse users' actions and the information landscape that they navigated (links, descriptions, and other data), they showed that information seekers use the same strategies as food foragers.

In the late 1990s, [[Ed H. Chi]] worked with Pirolli, Card and others at [[PARC (company)|PARC]] to further develop information scent ideas and algorithms to actually use these concepts in real interactive systems, including the modeling of web user browsing behavior, the inference of information needs from web visit log files, and the use of information scent concepts in reading and browsing interfaces.

==Details of the theory==

"[[Informavore]]s" constantly make decisions on what kind of information to look for, whether to stay at the current site to try to find additional information or whether they should move on to another site, which path or link to follow to the next information site, and when to finally stop the search. Although human cognition is not a result of evolutionary pressure to improve Web use, survival-related traits to respond quickly on partial information and reduce energy expenditures force them to optimise their searching behaviour and, simultaneously, to minimize the thinking required.

===Information scent===
The most important concept in the information foraging theory is ''information scent''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As animals rely on scents to indicate the chances of finding prey in current area and guide them to other promising patches, so do humans rely on various cues in the information environment to get similar answers. Human users estimate how much useful information they are likely to get on a given path, and after seeking information compare the actual outcome with their predictions. When the information scent stops getting stronger (i.e., when users no longer expect to find  useful additional information), the users  move to a different information source.

===Information diet===
Some tendencies in the behaviour of web users are easily understood from the information foraging theory standpoint. On the Web, each site is a patch and information is the prey. Leaving a site is easy, but finding good sites has not always been as easy. Advanced search engines have changed this fact by reliably providing relevant links, altering the foraging strategies of the users. When users expect that sites with lots of information are easy to find, they have less incentive to stay in one place. The growing availability of broadband connections may have a similar effect: always-on connections encourage this behavior, short online visits to get specific answers.

===Models===
Attempts have been made to develop computational cognitive models to characterize information foraging behavior on the Web.&lt;ref&gt;

These models assume that users perceive relevance of information based on some measures of information scent, which are usually derived based on statistical techniques that extract semantic relatedness of words from large text databases. Recently these information foraging models have been extended to explain social information behavior &lt;ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:Benbadhanabongse.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Prince Benbadhnabongse, the Prince of Phichai]]

In 1902, [[King Chulalongkorn]] attempted to promote the country's silk, silverware, and weaving industries. He hired Dr Kametaro Toyama from the [[University of Tokyo]], to train Siamese students in Japanese silk and weaving crafts.&lt;ref&gt;Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences [http://www.jircas.affrc.go.jp/english/publication/jarq/03-4/03-4-030-033.pdf "A Scientist and a Link of the Chain uniting Thailand and Japan"] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, the School of Sericulture was founded at [[Pathum Wan District|Tambon Thung Saladaeng]], [[Bangkok]] by [[Benbadhanabongse|Prince Benbadhanabongse]], the Director of the Department of Sericulture of the Ministry of Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;กรมหม่อนไหม [http://qsds.go.th/newqsds/inside_page.php?pageid=10 ประวัติกรมหม่อนไหม] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt; The school was renamed the School of Agriculture in 1906.

In 1908, the School of the Ministry of Agriculture was founded at [[Windsor Palace (Thailand)|Windsor Palace]] as the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (Thailand)|Ministry of Agriculture]] merged three schools, the School of Surveying (founded in 1882), the School of Irrigation (founded in 1905), and the School of Agriculture. Thailand's first tertiary-level agriculture curriculum began to offer courses in 1909.

In 1917, Phraya Thepsartsatit and [[Chaophraya Thammasakmontri]] of the Ministry of Education founded the first primary school of agriculture under the Ministry of Agriculture, named the Primary School Agriculture Teacher Training School in [[Pathum Wan District|Tambon Horwang]]. It moved to [[Mueang Nakhon Pathom District|Tambon Phra Prathon]], [[Nakhon Pathom Province]] in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;มหาวิทยาลัยเกษตรศาสตร์ [http://pirun.ku.ac.th/~fedupst/Chapter4.pdf การพัฒนาอาชีวเกษตรกรรม] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, [[Sithiporn Kridakara|Prince Sithiporn Kridakara]] and Chaophraya Thammasakmontri together expanded the school regionally. In the central region, a campus was located in [[Saraburi Province]], in the northern region in [[Chiang Mai Province]], in the northeastern region in [[Nakhon Ratchasima Province]], and in the southern region in [[Songkhla Province]].

[[File:Monuments_of_the_3_Masters_of_Kasetsart_University.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Statue of the Three Masters of Kasetsart University]]

In 1935, the Primary School Agriculture Teacher Training School in each part of the country was closed and merged following the agricultural education policy in that time. Luang Ingkhasikasikan, Luang Suwan Vajokkasikij, and Phra Chuangkasetsinlapakan&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ku.ac.th/about/history_ku.html บุคคลสำคัญของมหาวิทยาลัย] เรียกดูวันที่ 2013-02-21&lt;/ref&gt; together proposed to maintain the Mae Jo School (today's [[Mae Jo University]]) at Chiang Mai Province only and renamed it Secondary-level Agriculture Technical School before it was elevated to the College of Agriculture, under the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.

The Ministry of Agriculture established the Central Agriculture Station or "Kaset Klang", in [[Bang Khen District]], Bangkok. It caused the College of Agriculture to move to Bang Khen District in 1938 and the government office at Chiang Mai Province became [[Mae Jo University|Kasetsart Preparatory School]] to prepare students to study at the College of Agriculture in Bang Khen.

In 1943, [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram|Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] promoted the College of Agriculture and established Kasetsart University as a department of the Ministry of Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;ราชกิจจานุเบกษา [http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2486/A/007/228.PDF พระราชบัญญัติมหาวิทยาลัยเกษตรศาสตร์ พุทธศักราช ๒๔๘๖] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt; The university consisted of four faculties: agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and cooperatives (today's Faculty of Economics and Faculty of Business Administration).&lt;ref&gt;ราชกิจจานุเบกษา [http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2486/A/007/228.PDF พระราชบัญญัติมหาวิทยาลัยเกษตรศาสตร์ พ.ศ. ๒๔๘๖] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Mom Luang Xujati Kambhu, the Fifth President of Kasetsart University, judged the Bang Khen campus too confined and unable to support the education in agricultural sciences called for by the National Social and Economics Development Plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.psd.ku.ac.th/kuout/p013.html ประวัติมหาวิทยาลัย] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kamphaeng Saen District|Kamphaeng Saen campus]] was established on 12 November 1979 as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ku.ac.th/newdesign/content_level.php?menulevel=22 ประวัติมหาวิทยาลัยทศวรรษที่สี่ พ.ศ. 2516-2525] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

The university further expanded by establishing [[Si Racha District|Si Racha campus]], [[Sakon Nakhon Province|Chalermphrakiat Sakon Nakhon Province campus]], [[Suphan Buri Province|Suphan Buri campus]], [[Krabi Province|Krabi campus]] and [[Lopburi Province|Lopburi campus]]. The university already established Si Racha campus in 1989&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.src.ku.ac.th/WebEng/index2.php?iPage=info/abCampus.html History of the Campus] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt; and the Chalermphrakiat Sakon Nakhon Province campus on 15 August 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csc.ku.ac.th/index.php/en/about-us/about-university/about-the-kucsc About KU.CSC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103165335/http://www.csc.ku.ac.th/index.php/en/about-us/about-university/about-the-kucsc |date=3 January 2017 }} Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 July 2015, the Kasetsart University Act B.E. 2558 (2015) transformed it from a [[public university]] to a [[national university]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2558/A/066/1.PDF พระราชบัญญัติมหาวิทยาลัยเกษตรศาสตร์ พ.ศ. ๒๕๕๘] Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nontri tree===
The [[Peltophorum pterocarpum|Nontri tree]] has been a symbol of Kasetsart University since 1963. The [[Bhumibol Adulyadej|king]] and [[Sirikit|queen]] planted nine Nontri trees in the front of Kasetsart University's main auditorium on 29 November 1963 which became historic day for Nisit Kasetsart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ku.ac.th/aboutku/thai/nontri.htm มหาวิทยาลัยเกษตรศาสตร์: ต้นนนทรี] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201082549/http://www.ku.ac.th/aboutku/thai/nontri.htm |date=1 December 2010 }} Retrieved 2017-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nontri is a tree in the [[Fabaceae|Fabaceae family]]. It is a long-lived evergreen with grey-brown bark with upright branches. The leaves are [[bipinnate]] compound and the flowers are yellow, produced in large compound [[racemes]]. Its fruit is a pod containing seeds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8781">Obstetric complications are those complications that develop during pregnancy. A woman may develop an infection, syndrome or complication that is not unique to pregnancy and that may have existed before pregnancy. Pregnancy often is complicated by preexisting and concurrent conditions. Though these pre-existing and concurrent conditions may have great impact on pregnancy, they are not included in the following list.

'''Manchester Digital Music Archive (MDMarchive)''' is an online community archive founded in 2003 by Matthew Norman, Alison Surtees, [https://about.me/abigail_ward Abigail Ward], [[CP Lee]] and Dave Rofe. It was created as a way of celebrating and raising awareness of Greater Manchester's musical heritage and protecting collections of material held by individuals and institutions relating to the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdmarchive.co.uk/about_us.php|title=Manchester District Music Archive: Mission Statement|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of 2015 it became a registered charity.

== Beginnings ==
The archive, originally named Manchester District Music Archive, came about in 2003 after Surtees and Norman had the idea of making a documentary about the Greater Manchester music scene, loosely based on [[CP Lee]]’s book ‘Shake, Rattle and Rain’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Unconvention: Alison Surtees | url= http://unconventionhub.org/alison-surtees | accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Realising the subject was too vast to be contained within a documentary, Surtees and Norman, alongside Dave Rofe and CP Lee, decided to launch a campaign to create a Greater Manchester music museum. Abigail Ward joined the team shortly afterwards and began to develop an online presence for the project. Lee's book covered the history of Manchester music from 1955 - 1995 and contained an extensive band list at the end of the book, which was used a starting point when populating the band list on the Manchester Digital Music Archive website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CerysmaticFactory: Shake Rattle and Rain: Popular Music Making in Manchester 1955 - 1995 by CP Lee | url=http://www.cerysmaticfactory.info/shake_rattle_and_rain.php | accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A seminar was held at [[Urbis]] in 2004 to officially launch the newly constituted organisation with a panel featuring [[Jon Savage]], [[CP Lee]], [[Guy Garvey]], [[Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)|Mark Radcliffe]] and Jan Hargreaves. Hundreds attended the event and it was announced that the intention was to set up a museum where people could donate items of music ephemera to the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=21 September 2004 | title=CerysmaticFactory: Manchester District Music Archive Seminar | url= http://www.cerysmaticfactory.info/mdma_seminar_210904.php | accessdate= 4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The co-founders then spent a number of years trying to create a physical space for the archive but after years of struggling to find something suitable, a website was set up in 2006, which allowed users to upload images of their own personal artefacts, along with associated memories, relating to Greater Manchester music, musicians, DJs and venues. This online archive was developed by Abigail Ward with web designer Ashley Kennerley (Go Bang! Design).

In 2007 and 2014, Manchester Digital Music Archive won the Big Chip best not-for-profit project award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MDMA {{!}} The Big Chip Awards|url = http://bigchipawards.com/MDMA2007|website = bigchipawards.com|access-date = 2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Best Not for Profit Project {{!}} The Big Chip Awards|url = http://bigchipawards.com/BNFPP2014|website = bigchipawards.com|access-date = 2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2015 the site has in excess of 3000 members who have uploaded material relating to more than 3350 bands, 600 DJs and 1000 venues. Users are encouraged to provide memories and anecdotes along with their artefacts and the only stipulation is that items need to be linked to acts or venues from Greater Manchester. All genres of music are covered and as well as an extensive collection of pop memorabilia, the archive includes material relating to the history of the [[Royal Northern College of Music]] and the [[The Hallé|Halle Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Manchester District Music Archive Homepage | url= http://www.mdmarchive.co.uk/ | accessdate= 4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can comment on and discuss items uploaded by others or curate online themed exhibitions using material from the site. The site has a number of these exhibitions on various subjects including [[Moss Side]] and [[Hulme]] club culture, [[City Fun]] fanzine, Manchester's [[LGBT]] music and club culture and [[Royal Northern College of Music]] students who served in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Manchester District Music Archive: Exhibitions | url=http://www.mdmarchive.co.uk/exhibitions.php | accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charitable status ==
In November 2015, the organisation became a registered charity and in June 2017 changed its name to Manchester Digital Music Archive. The board of trustees are Dave Carter, CP Lee, Cathy Brooks, Aidan O'Rourke and Sarah Feinstein.

== Physical Presence ==
The archive exists online but has held numerous events and exhibitions at venues around Greater Manchester. In 2008 it held an event at [[Islington Mill]] which explored the city’s 1980s electro-funk scene, curated by DJ [[Greg Wilson (DJ)|Greg Wilson]]. The event included music and discussion and also showed the premiere of the Tim Forde documentary 'Birth of The British B-Boy', which tells the story of breakdancing in Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Electrofunkroots: Electrospective Press Release | url= http://www.electrofunkroots.co.uk/electrospective-event-press-release | accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, following investment from [[Heritage Lottery Fund]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hlf.org.uk/|title=Heritage Lottery Fund|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; MDMarchive held an exhibition, ''Defining Me: Musical Adventures in Manchester'' ,at The Lowry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Lowry: What’s On – Defining Me: Musical Adventures In Manchester | url= http://www.thelowry.com/event/defining-me-musical-adventures-in-manchester | accessdate = 4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 5-month show co-curated by members of MDMarchive's online community. The exhibition attracted a 32,000 visitors. There were a number of spin-off events featuring Greater Manchester music luminaries in conversation, including [[Barry Adamson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Barry Adamson  - onstage interview &amp; audience Q&amp;A|url = http://www.manchesterhistoriesfestival.org.uk/whatson/barryadamson|website = Manchester Histories|access-date = 2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Cummins (photographer)|Kevin Cummins]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Seven of Kraak Gallery’s best events|url = http://www.timeout.com/manchester/blog/seven-of-kraak-gallerys-best-events-081715|website = Time Out Manchester|access-date = 2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Boon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ever fallen in love with Richard Boon?|url = http://www.northernsoul.me.uk/ever-fallen-in-love-with-richard-boon/|website = Northern Soul|access-date = 2016-01-12|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the project ended with a community concert at [[Band on the Wall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Musical Adventures in Manchester'- featuring The Prospectors with Graham Massey &lt; Events {{!}} Band on the Wall|url = http://bandonthewall.org/events/4292/|website = bandonthewall.org|access-date = 2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring British rave pioneer [[Graham Massey]] in collaboration with The Prospectors, a collective of disabled musicians from [[Stockport]].

The archive also has a regular presence in the ''Louder Than Words'' festival - an annual event focused on literature within the music industry. In 2014 MDMarchive hosted a panel discussion which saw Elbow's Guy Garvey, Jaheda Choudhury-Potter of Ajah UK and [[Everything Everything]]'s Jon Higgs talk about Greater Manchester lyricism in music .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=EnglandEvents.co.uk: Manchester: Hear my voice in your head and think of me kindly | url=http://englandevents.co.uk/manchester-hear-my-voice-in-your-head-and-think-of-me-kindly/35912 | accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year it hosted another session, this time focusing on the work of virtual archives and included panellists from MDMarchive as well as writer [[Anita Sethi]] and Jez Collins from the Birmingham Music Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Louder Than Words: Festival Programme 2015 | url=http://louderthanwordsfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Louder-Than-Words-Events1.pdf | accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Manchester Digital Music Archive won further investment from Heritage Lottery Fund for ''Rebel Music: The Sound of Politics and Protest in Manchester''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hlf.org.uk/our-projects/rebel-music-sound-politics-and-protest-manchester|title=Rebel Music: The Sound of Politics and Protest in Manchester {{!}} Heritage Lottery Fund|website=www.hlf.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mdmarchive.co.uk/news.php?id=209|title=MDMarchive wins Heritage Lottery support for Rebel Music project : MANCHESTER DIGITAL MUSIC ARCHIVE|website=MANCHESTER DIGITAL MUSIC ARCHIVE|language=en|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;'','' a project exploring the intertwined histories of music and political activism across the ten boroughs of the Greater Manchester. The project will focus in particular on the musical achievements of women and the LGBT+ community.

Throughout the project, MDMarchive will be working with teams of volunteers from the two chosen communities (women and LGBT+ people) to co-produce a programme of events, two physical pop-up exhibitions, a series of digital exhibitions, six short films and three guided heritage walks. The volunteers will also access training on how to preserve and share their own musical heritage.

The first physical exhibition, ''Queer Noise: The History of LGBT+ Music &amp; Club Culture in Manchester'', will be held at the [[People's History Museum|People’s History Museum]] from July–September 2017 as part of ''Never Going Underground 2017'', a major exhibition marking 50 years since the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality. The second exhibition, ''Woman: Breaking The Rules'' is slated for February 2018 and will coincide with 100 Years of Women’s Suffrage.

The '''Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Max-Planck-Institut zur Erforschung multireligiöser und multiethnischer Gesellschaften'') is located in [[Göttingen]], [[Germany]]. It is one of 83 institutes in the [[Max Planck Society]] (''Max-Planck-Gesellschaft'').

==History==
The MPI for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity is the successor of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for German History]] previously established in 1917 in [[Berlin]]. Founded in 1956 as the [[Max Planck Institute for History]], the institute  was renamed to its current form based on the decision of the Senate of the [[Max Planck Society]] in March 2007.

==Research==
The Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity is one of the foremost centers for the multi-disciplinary study of diversity, in its multiple forms, in today’s globalizing world. As societies across the globe become ever more diverse, pressing new challenges emerge to the fore, motivating the study of questions such as the relationship between mobility and inequality; the interaction of globalization, religious diversity, and the secular state; the legal boundaries of cultural accommodation; global cities and super-diversity within them; new forms of membership and belonging; and the trans-bordering networking of ethnic and religious minorities. These thematic clusters provide a glimpse into the foundational queries that animate the rigorous scholarly investigation pursued by researchers at the Institute through a variety of disciplinary perspectives, including, but not limited to, anthropology, sociology, political science, and law.

==Departments==

===Ethics, Law and Politics===
The department, led by Ayelet Shachar, focuses on questions of citizenship, identity, and mobility are at the frontiers of scholarly research. Researchers at the department explore these developments and ask foundational questions, cutting across traditional disciplinary lines, with special emphasis placed on three interrelated themes: the relationship between diversity and equality in public law and private dispute resolution; the legal construction of borders and membership boundaries; and the intersection of states and markets in defining “who belongs“ within the political community, according to what criteria, and with what implications for shaping new disparities of mobility and opportunity at a time of profound and rapid migration and globalization pressures. The focus is on cutting-edge theoretical and legal puzzles; comparative approaches and international collaboration are strongly encouraged. 

===Religious Diversity===
The department, led by [[Peter van der Veer]], offers a research program developed within the ideographic tradition of [[anthropology]] and [[religious studies]] and thus allows for quite a variety of individual projects that try to answer questions that are not predetermined by theoretical models but developed in ethnographic or micro-sociological fieldwork. To contain this variety, a regional focus on South, South-East and East Asia has been chosen because of the importance of this region in terms of its share in the world’s population and with the assumption that comparisons can be fruitfully made across this region. This is because common civilizational histories as well as common histories of imperialism and cold war politics have transformed the religious traditions of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Daoism]], [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] into "modern religions" in the Western sense. From the start, concerted efforts have been made to create collaborations with research institutions and researchers in the societies in which fieldwork projects are carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |URL=http://www.mmg.mpg.de/departments/religious-diversity/ |title=Religious diversity - Research focus |author=Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socio-Cultural Diversity===
The department, led by Steven Vertovec, is devoted to comparative empirical investigation and theoretical development surrounding various modes and manifestations of migration-driven diversity and [[superdiversity]]. The categories of diversity most relevant to their research interests are race and ethnicity, religion, gender, class, migration channel and migration status. Moreover, they are particularly interested in the ways and processes by which patterns of migration-driven diversity are related to other modes of increasing social, cultural, economic and political differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |URL=http://www.mmg.mpg.de/departments/socio-cultural-diversity/research-focus/ |title=Socio-cultural diversity - Research focus |author=Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7895">'''Melting curve analysis''' is an assessment of the dissociation characteristics of double-stranded [[DNA]] during heating. As the temperature is raised, the double strand begins to dissociate leading to a rise in the absorbance intensity, [[hyperchromicity]]. The temperature at which 50% of DNA is denatured is known as the [[Nucleic acid thermodynamics#Denaturation|melting temperature]].

The information gathered can be used to infer the presence and identity of [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNP). This is because G-C base pairing have 3 [[hydrogen bonds]] between them while A-T base pairs have only 2. DNA with a higher G-C content, whether because of its source (G-C contents: E. coli 0.50, M. luteus 0.72, poly d(AT) 0.00) or, as previously mentioned, because of SNPs, will have a higher melting temperature than DNA with a higher A-T content.

The information also gives vital clues to a molecule's mode of interaction with DNA. Molecules such as [[Intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalator]]s slot in between base pairs and interact through [[pi stacking]]. This has a stabilizing effect on DNA's structure which leads to a raise in its melting temperature. Likewise, increasing salt concentrations helps diffuse negative repulsions between the phosphates in the DNA's backbone. This also leads to a rise in the DNA's melting temperature. Conversely, pH can have a negative effect on DNA's stability which may lead to a lowering of its melting temperature.

==Implementation==
[[Image:Melting Curve Analysis Graphs.svg|thumb|Graphs to show the relation between fluorescence and temperature for labeled probe designed for a Wt sequence, homozygous Wt, heterozygous and homozygous mutant situations]]
The energy required to break the base-base hydrogen bonding between two strands of DNA is dependent on their length, GC content and their complementarity. By heating a reaction-mixture that contains double-stranded DNA sequences and measuring dissociation against temperature, these attributes can be inferred.

Originally, strand dissociation was observed using UV absorbance measurements,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The temperature-dependent dissociation between two DNA-strands can be measured using a [[Intercalation (biochemistry)|DNA-intercalating]] [[fluorophore]] such as [[SYBR green]], EvaGreen or fluorophore-labelled [[DNA probes]]. In the case of SYBR green (which fluoresces 1000-fold more intensely while intercalated in the minor groove of two strands of DNA), the dissociation of the DNA during heating is measurable by the large reduction in fluorescence that results.&lt;ref name="Hou"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hou, Shaw |title=Biocatalysis and Biomolecular Engineering |date=2010 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=314-317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, juxtapositioned probes (one featuring a fluorophore and the other, a suitable [[quencher (fluorescence)|quencher]]) can be used to determine the complementarity of the probe to the target sequence.&lt;ref name="Hou"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The graph of the negative [[first derivative]] of the melting-curve may make it easier to pin-point the temperature of dissociation (defined as 50% dissociation), by virtue of the peaks thus formed.

SYBR Green enabled product differentiation in the LightCycler in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Ririe, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Hybridization probes (or FRET probes) were also demonstrated to provide very specific melting curves from the single-stranded (ss) probe-to-amplicon hybrid. Idaho Technology and Roche have done much to popularize this use on the LightCycler instrument.

==Applications==

Since the late 1990s product analysis via SYBR Green, other double-strand specific dyes, or probe-based melting curve analysis has become nearly ubiquitous. The probe-based technique is sensitive enough to detect single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and can distinguish between [[homozygous]] [[wildtype]], [[heterozygous]] and homozygous [[mutant]] alleles by virtue of the dissociation patterns produced. Without probes, amplicon melting (melting and analysis of the entire PCR product) was not generally successful at finding single base variants through melting profiles. With higher resolution instruments and advanced dyes, amplicon melting analysis of one base variants is now possible with several commercially available instruments. For example: Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast System and the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System, Idaho Technology's LightScanner (the first plate-based high resolution melting device), Qiagen's Rotor-Gene instruments, and Roche's LightCycler 480 instruments.

Many research and clinical examples&lt;ref&gt;Lay MJ, Wittwer CT. (1997) Real-time fluorescence genotyping of factor V Leiden during rapid-cycle PCR. Clin Chem. 1997 Dec;43(12):2262-7&lt;/ref&gt; exist in the literature that show the use of melting curve analysis to obviate or complement sequencing efforts, and thus reduce costs.

While most [[quantitative PCR]] machines have the option of melting curve generation and analysis, the level of analysis and software support varies. [[High Resolution Melt]] (known as either Hi-Res Melting, or HRM) is the advancement of this general technology and has begun to offer higher sensitivity for SNP detection within an entire dye-stained amplicon. It is less expensive and simpler in design to develop probeless melting curve systems. However, for genotyping applications, where large volumes of samples must be processed, the cost of development may be less important than the total throughput and ease of interpretation, thus favoring probe-based genotyping methods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6923">'''Michael Glykas''' or '''Glycas''' ({{lang-gr|Μιχαὴλ Γλυκᾶς}}) was a 12th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[historian]], [[theologian]], [[mathematician]], [[astronomer]] and [[poet]]. He was probably from [[Corfu]] and lived in [[Constantinople]]. He was a critic of [[Manuel I Komnenos]], and was imprisoned and [[political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blinded]] due to his participation in a conspiracy against the emperor. He is also identified by modern scholarship with '''Michael Sikidites''' (Μιχαὴλ Σικιδίτης), who was condemned as a [[heresiarch]] in 1200.

==Life==
[[File:Manuel I Comnenus.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Manuscript miniature of [[Manuel I Komnenos]], [[Vatican Library]]]]
Glykas was born sometime in the first third of the 12th century,&lt;ref name=ODB&gt;{{ODB|title=Glykas, Michael|last=Kazhdan|first=Alexander|authorlink=Alexander Kazhdan|pages=855–856}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly {{circa|1130}}.&lt;ref name=LexMA&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Glykas Sikidites, Michael|last=Schreiner|first=Peter|at=col. 1519|encyclopedia=[[Lexikon des Mittelalters]]|volume=4|publisher=Artemis &amp; Winkler|location=Munich and Zürich|year=1989|isbn=3-7608-8904-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His probable birthplace was [[Corfu]].&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt;&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt;

He served as imperial secretary (''grammatikos'') under Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] ({{reign|1143|1180}}), before being involved in a conspiracy against the emperor and being [[political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blinded]]. The blinding was probably partial or slight, since he continued his literary activity.&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt;&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt; The exact nature of this conspiracy is unknown, but Otto Kresten suggested a connection with the alleged conspiracy that led to the downfall of Manuel's chief minister [[Theodore Styppeiotes]] in 1158/9.&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt; He remained imprisoned until at least 1164, and his subsequent fate is unknown. Modern scholars commonly support his identity with a certain Michael Sikidites, charged with heresy and magic in {{circa|1200}}.&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt;&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt;

According to [[Niketas Choniates]], this Sikidites "was enrolled among the imperial secretaries" of Manuel I, was known of performing magic spells, conjuring serpents and demons. He preached a doctrine according to which the [[sacraments]] of the [[Eucharist]] were mortal and corruptible, as Christ's own body was. Furthermore, Sikidites and his followers considered a [[bodily resurrection]] impossible, and thought that the dead would be resurrected as ghostly spirits only. The doctrine appears to have enjoyed some support in leading circles, notably of the [[Patriarchs of Constantinople]] [[George II Xiphilinos]] and [[John X Kamateros]], but also aroused passionate opposition; in a [[synod]] in 1200, Sikidites was censured and his teachings declared heretical.&lt;ref name=Sikidites&gt;{{cite book |last=Simpson |first=Alicia |title=Niketas Choniates: A Historiographical Study |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-967071-0 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nePUAAAAQBAJ | pages = 28, 47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
His first known work were his ''Verses from Prison'', a poem of 581 lines in [[political verse]], written during his imprisonment. It contains many elements of the vernacular Greek language of his time (an early form of [[Modern Greek]]), in contrast to the highly stylized and archaic [[Attic Greek]] favoured by Byzantine intellectuals.&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt;&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt; In 1164/65, he composed an ''[[encomium]]'' celebrating Emperor Manuel's Hungarian campaign.&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt; He also wrote a mathematical treatise on the distinction between [[astronomy]] and [[astrology]],&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt; where he severely criticised Manuel I for his fondness for the latter; in the same vein, Glykas strongly rejected the concept of inevitable fate (''ananke'') as a force in history.&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt; 

His chief work is his [[chronicle]] (βίβλος χρονική, ''biblos chronike'') of events from the [[Dating creation|creation of the world]] to the death of [[Alexios I Komnenos]] in 1118.&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt;&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt; His main sources for the chronicle were [[George Monachos]], [[John Skylitzes]] and his continuators, [[John Zonaras]], and [[Constantine Manasses]].&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt; Over half the work is dedicated to the narrative of the creation and early Jewish history.&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt; As a historical source, it contains no new information,&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt; but Glykas displays his opposition to the [[Komnenian dynasty]], and emulates Zonaras in his criticism of Alexios I.&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt; 

Another notable work, which led [[Hans-Georg Beck]] to describe Glykas as the "most original and vivid [[exegete]] of the 12th century", was the collection of 95 replies on theological questions (Εἰς τὰς ἀπορίας τῆς Θείας Γραφῆς κεφάλαια, ''Chapters on the questions on the Holy Scripture''), written in letter form. Among them is a letter where he criticises Manuel I for his incorrect use of passages from the [[Church Fathers]].&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt;

His surviving work, including his letters, is "overtly didactic", promoting Christian virtues, and making extensive use of [[proverbs]] to this end.&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15794">'''Misattribution of arousal''' is a term in [[psychology]] which describes the process whereby people make a mistake in assuming what is causing them to feel [[arousal|aroused]]. For example, when actually experiencing physiological responses related to [[fear]], people mislabel those responses as romantic arousal. The reason physiological symptoms may be attributed to incorrect stimuli is because many stimuli have similar physiological symptoms such as increased [[blood pressure]] or [[shortness of breath]].

One of the initial studies looking into this phenomenon conducted by Schachter and Singer (1962)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schachter|first1=S|last2=Singer|first2=J|title=Cognitive, social, and physiological determinants of emotional state|journal=Psychological Review|date=1962|volume=69|issue=5|pages=379–399|doi=10.1037/h0046234}}&lt;/ref&gt; was based on the idea that the experience of arousal could be ambiguous and therefore misattributed to an incorrect stimulus. Operating under this assumption, the researchers developed the [[two factor theory of emotion]]. Misattribution of arousal, which is an influence on emotion processing, can be found in multiple situations, such as romantic situations and physiological responses from exercise.

An example of the possible effects of misattribution of arousal is perceiving a potential partner as more attractive because of a heightened state of physiological stress. A study done by White et al. (1981)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=G|last2=Fishbein|first2=S|last3=Rutsein|first3=J|title=Passionate love and the misattribution of arousal|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1981|volume=41|pages=56–62|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.41.1.56}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigated this phenomenon and found that those in an unrelated aroused state will rate an attractive confederate more highly than a rater without arousal. The researchers also found that aroused raters would dislike an unattractive confederate more than those without arousal.

== Initial demonstration ==

=== Experiment ===
[[Donald Dutton]] and [[Arthur Aron]]'s  (1974)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dutton|first1=D.G.|last2=Aaron|first2=A. P.|title=Some evidence for heightened sexual attraction under conditions of high anxiety|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1974|volume=30|issue=4|pages=510–517|doi=10.1037/h0037031|pmid=4455773}}&lt;/ref&gt; study to test the causation of misattribution of arousal incorporated an attractive confederate female to wait at the end of a bridge that was either a suspension bridge (that would induce fear) or a sturdy bridge (that would not induce fear). After the males crossed the bridge, they were stopped by a female confederate and took a [[Thematic Apperception Test]] wherein they had to compose a short story based on an ambiguous image; the image chosen was purposefully not sexual at all. Afterward, the story was analyzed for sexual content. The female confederate, who was not aware of the true hypothesis of the experiment, then gave her phone number to the males if they had any more questions about the experiment and the researchers documented how many males called the confederate. As the men finished the survey, the woman explained she would be available to answer any questions regarding her project, giving her [[phone number]] and name to the male subjects. Dutton and Aron wondered if the participants were more likely to call the woman because they were physically attracted to her or not. However, Dutton and Aron had to take into consideration that some factors of the men, such as the possibility of some men already being involved in a relationship or how an individual male interpreted the woman's body gestures.
Therefore, Dutton and Aron had the woman survey the men under two conditions:  immediately after they crossed a {{convert|450|ft|m|sing=on}}-long bridge or after they had crossed and had enough time to rest. In the first condition, the men who were surveyed during their cross over the bridge would have had their arousal level increased as they were speaking to the woman. Conditions such as experiencing winds during their walk and the nervous feeling may have contributed to their fast-paced [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]]s and rapid [[breathing]].

In the other condition, the woman had approached the men after they had crossed the bridge. They had enough time to rest and get their heartbeat and breathing back to normal.

=== Results ===
More males contacted the female experimenter when they had just walked down the suspension bridge, which was thought to be due to their misattribution of their arousal (they believed that they were feeling sexual arousal at the sight of the female instead of feeling the leftover physiological arousal from the fear of walking across the suspension bridge). This was interpreted by the researchers to mean that the men found the woman more attractive when they had more anxiety about crossing the bridge. There were no significant differences on either bridge when the researchers used a male confederate to give the Thematic Apperception Test and his phone number for any further questions about the experiment.

== Subsequent research ==

=== Experiment: expansion on initial demonstration ===

Fear is not the only emotion that can be a result of misattribution of arousal. One of the earlier studies that focused on misattribution of arousal was done by Schachter and Singer in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schachter|first1=S|last2=Singer|first2=J|title=Cognitive, social, and physiological determinants of emotional state|journal=Psychological Review|date=1962|volume=69|issue=5|pages=379–399|doi=10.1037/h0046234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers told the participants in their study that they were testing how their vision responded to a shot of vitamins called Suproxin. Suproxin was actually a shot of epinephrine or a placebo. Epinephrine activated the sympathetic nervous system and produced systems such as an elevated heart rate and blood pressure. The researchers then either told the participants the effects of the epinephrine, said nothing about any potential effects of the epinephrine, or told them they may feel some effects that had nothing to do with the epinephrine (for example, the researchers told the participants they could experience a headache from the shot). The participants were told that they had to wait 20 min for the Suproxin to get into their bloodstreams. While they were waiting, a confederate (a participant who is also covertly collaborating with/an associate of the researchers) who was either euphoric or angry waited with the participant to see if the emotion of the participant could be manipulated by the epinephrine and the emotion of the confederate. The confederate played basketball with pieces of balled up scrap paper while in the euphoric state or had to take a questionnaire and became very angry with the personal questions in the anger state.The participants then were observed to see if they appeared to be angry or euphoric and took a self-reported survey about their mood.

They found that if someone was physiologically aroused without being aware of it, they would attribute their arousal to a recent thought in their memory.The researchers also found that emotions (in this study, euphoria and anger) could be manipulated by providing a participant with a shot of epinephrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schachter|first1=S|last2=Singer|first2=J|title=Cognitive, social, and physiological determinants of emotional state|journal=Psychological Review|date=1962|volume=69|issue=5|pages=379–399|doi=10.1037/h0046234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiment: influence on confidence ===

Misattribution of arousal can also influence how much confidence one feels before completing a task. One study conducted by Savitsky, Medvec, Charlton, and Gilovich&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savitsky|first1=K|last2=Medvec|first2=V|last3=Charlton|first3=A|last4=Gilovich|first4=T|title=What, me worry?' Arousal, misattribution and the effect of temporal distance on confidence|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=1998|volume=24|issue=5|pages=529–536|doi=10.1177/0146167298245008}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on how confidence can be affected by misattribution of arousal. Typically people feel more confident before they are supposed to do a task, but the closer they get to having to perform that task, the less confident they feel, which could be due to the arousal from the expectation of the performance. The researchers told participants that they would be exposed to a subliminal noise and were then asked if they could predict how well they would do on two tasks. After they made their predictions, the researchers either told them that the noise could make them nervous, the noise would have no effect on them, or they were told that they would not have to do the tasks until the next session a month away after they were exposed to the noise. The tasks were to unscramble anagrams or to recall as many nonsense syllables as they could after seeing them briefly. They could earn money for the tasks (more money was earned for each anagram unscrambled or each syllable correctly recalled). The participants then predicted how well they did on the tasks, and how well they believed everyone else did on the task. A second experiment replicated this first experiment.The researchers had participants attribute their arousal to noises that they heard, which resulted in those participants feeling more confident that they did well on the tasks than those that attributed their arousal to the performance anxiety from the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savitsky|first1=K|last2=Medvec|first2=V|last3=Charlton|first3=A|last4=Gilovich|first4=T|title='What, me worry?' Arousal, misattribution and the effect of temporal distance on confidence|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=1998|volume=24|issue=5|pages=529–536|doi=10.1177/0146167298245008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiment: polarity ===
White, Fishbein, and Rutsein generated further research on the misattribution of arousal with their 1981 study, “Passionate Love and the Misattribution of Arousal.” The researchers performed their study using two experiments. In the first experiment, 54 male participants were placed under varying degrees of physical exertion, in order to create a state of arousal. The participants were then asked to view a video of a female confederate either manipulated to be attractive or unattractive. The video was a self-disclosure statement where the female discussed hobbies and other typically dating related material. After completing the video, participants were given thirteen attraction trait criteria on which to rate the female. The experiment confirmed the researcher's hypothesis that individuals in a neutral aroused state were more likely to rate a target as attractive than an unaroused individual.
White, Fishbein, and Rutsein hypothesized that the polarity of an individual's arousal could influence the impact of the misattribution of arousal. To test this hypothesis the researchers created three separate videos to prime the subjects with a positive, negative, or neutral arousal. Sixty six male participants were asked to watch one of the videos and then rate the female as in the first study. The study found that regardless of the stimuli's polarity, the participants in the aroused state found the attractive confederate more attractive and the unattractive confederate as less attractive than the unaroused participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=G|last2=Fishbein|first2=S|last3=Rutsein|first3=J|title=Passionate love and the misattribution of arousal|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1981|volume=41|pages=56–62|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.41.1.56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiment: conditional emotional responses ===

A study done by Loftis and Ross in 1974 looked at the effects of misattribution of arousal upon acquisition and extinction of a conditional emotional response. They conducted two experiments with 89 female undergraduates to show that misattribution procedures can alter physiological response to a conditioned source of a fear or arousal. The results suggested that self perception and attribution play a major role in emotional response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loftis|first=Jack|author2=Ross|title=Effects of misattribution of arousal upon the acquisition and extinction of a conditioned emotional response|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=November 1974|volume=30|issue=5|pages=673–682|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/614269444/|doi=10.1037/h0037414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiment: alternate model ===

Additionally, a study conducted by Allen, Kenrick, Linder and McCall in 1989 suggested an alternative explanation to the misattribution of arousal in terms of attraction-arousal (as there are other types of arousal that can be misattributed). The original model of misattribution of arousal essentially states that the person who is aroused will only be attracted to the target person, so long as they are unaware of the true cause of arousal.  Allen et al. propose a different model called Response-Facilitation, in which they suggest that the subject that is aroused will be more attracted to the target person (compared to people who are unaroused), regardless of if they know the true source of the stimulation. To test this new model, they ran two studies in which they manipulated the type of arousal the participants experienced and the salience (awareness) of the arousal. In one study, they put the participants into three different groups: control (no arousal), arousal-awareness (where they were put in front of an attractive person, but knew what the actual cause of arousal (exercise) was), and arousal-unaware (where they were put in front of an attractive person but didn't realize the true cause of arousal). After conducting the study, the researchers found that regardless of whether the person was aware of the true cause of arousal, they were still more attracted to the target person than those in the control condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=J|last2=Kenrick|first2=D|last3=Linder|first3=D|last4=McCall|first4=M|title=Arousal and attraction: A response-facilitation alternative to misattribution and negative-reinforcement models|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1989|volume=57|issue=2|pages=261–270|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.57.2.261}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, whereas the original theory of misattribution of arousal said that people could only misattribute their arousal if they were unaware of the true cause, the Response-Facilitation model states that it is possible that people could be aware of the true cause of arousal and still find themselves attracted to someone, compared to people who are unaroused.  This demonstrates another potential model that could explain the attraction-arousal component of the misattribution of arousal theory.

'''Myca''' is a [[software development]] company specializing in [[health care|healthcare]]. It is headquartered in [[Quebec City]], [[Quebec|QC]], [[Canada]] with offices in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|NY]], [[United States|USA]].

== History ==

Myca was founded in 2002 by Nathanial B. Findlay. The company's first product was a mobile [[nutrition]] platform called MyFoodPhone. MyFoodPhone is a small [[Mobile software|cell-phone application]] that provides customers with a full nutrition journal and access to a nutrition professional. Customers take a picture of their meals and send them via MyFoodPhone to be analyzed by a personal nutrition coach or advisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/06/AR2005060601686.html|title=The Camera Phone Diet|last=Pegoraro|first=Rob|date=7 June 2005|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/06/71102|title=Camera Phones Help Fight Bulge|last=Metz|first=Rachel|date=27 June 2006|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|publisher=[[Wired News]]|accessdate=2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MyFoodPhone was rebranded as Myca Nutrition in 2007.

== Activities ==

Started in 2007, Myca developed a practice management system that allows physicians to perform remote consultations by using [[videoconferencing]], [[Instant messaging &amp; messengers|instant messaging]], phone, mobile and secure [[E-mail|email]]. With this platform patients can schedule either home, clinic or online appointments with a doctor. The Myca platform provides a full billing back-end service that allows doctors to be reimbursed for their remote visits.

The Myca Platform is commercialized in the [[United States]] under the [[Hello Health]] trademark. Hello Health operates under the software as a service business model so patients sign up online to communicate with their physician.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;Rowland, Kara. "Wireless wellness: If you've got a phone, you've got a diagnostician", ''[[The Washington Times]]'', 2008-06-16, p. B1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Myca launched its first Hello Health clinic in July 2008 in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name=Times /&gt; Dr. Jay Parkinson, MD, MPH, Dr. Sean Khozin, MD, MPH  and Dr. Devlyn Corrigan D.O. were the first Hello Health doctors and operated the Williamsburg clinic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/health/2008/06/09/technodoc-jay-parkinson-says-hello-to-franchising/|title=Health Blog : Technodoc Jay Parkinson Says Hello to Franchising|last=Hensley|first=Scott|date=9 June 2008|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors are highly implicated in the Hello Health product definition as well. The company plan to offer its service elsewhere in the New York area &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/31/32/31_32_jf_hello_health.html|title=The doctor is in — and hip!|last=Firger|first=Jessica|date=15 August 2008|work=The Brooklyn paper|accessdate=2008-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Institute of Pulse Processes and Technologies (IPPT) of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]]''' is a [[research institute]] of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.

In 1959 on an initiative of young enthusiasts and support of the Mykolaiv city authorities there was created a joint laboratory for studying a new phenomenon at that time as high-voltage charge in water (see [[electrohydrodynamics]]) and processes that accompany it.

Institute was established in 1991 on the basis of Planning and Design Bureau of Electrohydraulics of [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]], which existed in Mykolaiv since 1962. It specializes in studies of physical and technical aspects of high-voltage electric discharge in condensed matter, the creation of highly environmentally friendly resource and energy saving pulse technology on its basis.

IPPT is a scientific-industrial complex that includes the  Institute, a research plant and research and development center "VEGA". The structure of the institute - five academic departments (electrophysical studies dept., dept.  of pulse energy conversion processes and their management, dept. of  methods and techniques of pulsed impact onto liquid metals and crystallizing alloys, dept. of the intensification  of production of minerals, dept. of pulse electrical systems), and three engineering department.

More than 1000 technological systems for the foundry, metallurgical, mining and other industries were developed in the IPPT. The following unique facilities were created: Laboratory park for studying the physical processes in the electric explosion, pulsed power capacitors laboratory for the study of processes in the cores of rock at a pressure of 500 atmospheres and temperatures up to 1000 °C and metallographic and metallophysical complexes.

Since 1977 the Institute and its predecessor are publishing a collection of scientific papers.

== Biography ==

Jacobs was born in Montreal on 3 December 1939. His parents were both natives of [[New York City]]: Jacob Joseph Jacobs graduated from New York University as a chemical engineer and Francis Alexander graduated from Barnard College in ancient languages. His interest in nature and the landscape was nurtured during summer family trips to the ocean and others in the northern boreal forest. His commitment to the urban landscape was derived from his experience of the cultural diversity and convivial social energy of Montreal. He is married to Ellen Vineberg Jacobs, distinguished professor emerita of Concordia University in Montreal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.recherche.umontreal.ca/la-recherche-a-ludem/la-vitrine-des-professeurs/informations/chercheur/495/pid/16/|title=Portail de la recherche: Informations|website=www.recherche.umontreal.ca|language=fr-FR|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobs graduated from Antioch College with a bachelor's degree (1961) in engineering and fine arts. He continued his studies at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], where he obtained a Masters of Architecture degree (1964) followed by a Master of Landscape Architecture degree (1968).&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; He then pursued a program of special studies in human ecology at Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archiv.umontreal.ca/P0000/P0397.html|title=P0397 Fonds Peter Jacobs- Université de Montréal – Division de la gestion de documents et des archives|website=www.archiv.umontreal.ca|language=fr|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his studies, Jacobs pursued both an academic and professional career. After first practicing architecture, he concentrated on landscape planning and urban design. In 1971 he was promoted to associate professor and in 1979 to full professor in the School of Landscape Architecture, Universite de Montreal. He was the school's first director (1978) and the first associate dean of research of the Faculte de l’Amenagement (1977–1984).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web |title=P0397 Fonds Peter Jacobs- Université de Montréal – Division de la gestion de documents et des archives|url=http://www.archiv.umontreal.ca/P0000/P0397.html|last=Udem|first=Archives|website=www.archiv.umontreal.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; He was named Emeritus professor in 2016.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Peter Jacobs is Fellow and past president of the [[Canadian Society of Landscape Architects]] (CSLA) (1978–1980), Fellow of the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA), and served as the Canadian delegate to the [[International Federation of Landscape Architects]] (IFLA) (1986–1995). In 2016, he was named Chair of the Montreal Heritage Council.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/article/2016/12/02/peter-jacobs-nomme-a-la-presidence-du-conseil-du-patrimoine-de-montreal/|title=Peter Jacobs nommé à la présidence du Conseil du patrimoine de Montréal|date=2017-03-17|access-date=2017-04-03|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main achievements and contributions ==

=== Pedagogical development of a new field of studies ===
Jcobs' teaching is based on the structure and meaning of the urban and rural landscape as well as the use of criteria such as belonging, equity, and integrity in the design of landscape form. Due to his expertise, Peter Jacobs has been invited to evaluate numerous academic programs in Canada, Israel, Columbia, France, China and Spain. He has also given intensive courses and design studios in more than 50 universities around the world.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

His research and community activities have focused on the sustainable and equitable development and conservation of the landscape in association with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with the Kativik Environmental Quality Commission as Chair of the Commission (KEQC) since 1979,&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mddelcc.gouv.qc.ca/evaluations/cqek.htm|title=Commission de la qualité de l'environnement Kativik (CQEK)|website=www.mddelcc.gouv.qc.ca|language=fr|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as Chair of the Public Advisory Council for the Canadian State of the Environment Report (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The State of Canada's Environment|last=|first=|publisher=Government of Canada, Canada Communication Group|year=1991|isbn=0-660-14237-6|location=the University of California|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early stages of environmental evaluation ===
Jacobs was one of the early participants in a variety of environmental evaluation formats related to urban development and the North, both as a chair and a member of numerous public commissions. He chaired the public consultation process on the future of Lancaster Sound in the Canadian arctic (1980) and has Chaired the Kativik Environmental Quality Commission in [[Nunavik]] (since 1981).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; He also co-Chaired the public hearings related to the environmental impacts of the [[James Bay Hydroelectric Project|Great Whale Hydoelectric Project]] flowing into [[James Bay]], Quebec (1992–1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nunavik : un environnement en évolution|last=Jacobs|first=Peter|last2=Berrouard|first2=Daniel|last3=Paul|first3=Mireille|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=|editor-last=Commission de la qualité de l’environnement Kativik|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the urban context, he has participated as a commissioner for the Bureau de consultation de Montreal and the Office de consultation Publique de Montreal on files related to the development of urban neighborhoods, urban infrastructure, and the planning and design of large metropolitan parks and nature reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ocpm.qc.ca/commissaire/peter-jacobs|title=Peter Jacobs|date=2015-12-14|work=OCPM|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

In 1990, as a member of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Research Council (CEARC), he co-edited and was one of the chief architects of a research report on ''Sustainable Development and Environmental Assessment : Perspectives on Planning for a Common Future''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sustainable Development and Environmental Assessment : Perspectives on Planning for a Common Future|last=Jacobs|first=Peter|last2=Sadler|first2=Barry|publisher=Canadian Environmental Assessment Research Council|year=1988|isbn=|location=Hull, Quebec|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, he has served as a consultant for programs sponsored by [[UNESCO]], MAB, UNU, and [[IUCN protected area categories|IUCN]].

=== Relationship of landscape and culture ===
One of the principal research fields developed by Jacobs is linked to the impact of culture and cultural values to the perception and management of landscapes. Numerous international missions in Africa, Latin America, Australia, and Europe as well as the arctic landscapes of Northern Quebec have provided a rich array of conditions and experiences that contribute to a diversity of cultural perspectives as to how the landscape is perceived and managed.

His prolonged research visits to Dumbarton Oaks as chair of the Senior Fellows of the Landscape and Garden Studies program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doaks.org/research/garden-landscape|title=Garden and Landscape Studies  — Dumbarton Oaks|last=admin|website=www.doaks.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and subsequently as Beatrix Farrand Distinguished Fellow provided further material with which to evaluate the diverse cultural visions of the landscape.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doaks.org/library-archives/dumbarton-oaks-archives/historical-records/oral-history-project/peter-jacobs|title=Peter Jacobs — Dumbarton Oaks|last=gabrielas|website=www.doaks.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community service ===
Jacobs' commitment to the community is marked by his desire to integrate professional practice with academic research in the service of community growth and development. As chair of the Environmental Planning Commission&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; from 1978–1990, he helped formulate nature conservation programs and action plans for numerous countries. His environmental activities have focused on nature conservancy, the preservation of urban open space, and the development of policy, programs, and plans in support of equitable and sustainable development.

He has served as vice-president of the Solomon Schecter Academy (1973–1976), advisor to the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, member of the intercultural advisory committee of the City of Montreal, and president of the Jewish Public Library of Montreal(1996–2000)&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.federationcja.org/media/singles/1191342115.pdf|title=Rapport Annuel|last=Federation CJA|first=|date=2006–2007|website=www.federationcja.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also served as Chair of the community planning and allocations committee and as a Director of the Federation of Jewish Community Agencies, the United Israel Agencies of Canada and the Canadian Jewish National Fund.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Photoperiodism''' is the physiological reaction of organisms to the length of day or night. It occurs in [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s. Photoperiodism can also be defined as the developmental responses of plants to the relative lengths of light and dark periods.
They are classified under three groups according to the photoperiods,they are:
1. Short-day plants
2. Long-day plants
3. Day-neutral plants.

== Plants ==&lt;!-- [[Photoperiodic plant]] redirects here --&gt;
{{anchor|In plants}}
Many [[flowering plant]]s (angiosperms) use a [[photoreceptor protein]], such as [[phytochrome]] or [[cryptochrome]],&lt;ref name=mauseth&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last= Mauseth|first= James D.|title=Botany : An Introduction to Plant Biology |edition=3rd|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7637-2134-3|publisher= Jones and Bartlett Learning|location=Sudbury, MA|pages=422–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; to sense seasonal changes in night length, or photoperiod, which they take as signals to flower. In a further subdivision, ''obligate'' photoperiodic plants absolutely require a long or short enough night before flowering, whereas ''facultative'' photoperiodic plants are more likely to flower under one condition.

Phytochrome comes in two forms: pr and pfr. Red light (which is present during the day) converts phytochrome to its active form (pfr). This then triggers the plant to grow. In turn, far-red light is present in the shade or in the dark and this converts phytochrome from pfr to pr. Pr is the inactive form of phytochrome and will not allow for plant growth. This system of pfr to pr conversion allows the plant to sense when it is night and when it is day.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Pfr can also be convereted back to Pr by a process known as dark reversion, where long periods of darkness trigger the conversion of Pfr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Casal|first=J.J.|date=2014|title=Light perception and signalling by phytochrome A|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=65 (11).|issue=11|pages=2835–2845|doi=10.1093/jxb/ert379}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important in regards to plant flowering. Experiments by Halliday et al. showed that manipulations of the red-to far-red ratio in Arabidopsis can alter flowering. They discovered that plants tend to flower later when exposed to more red light, proving that red light is inhibitory to flowering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Chentao|date=2000|title=Photoreceptors and Regulation of Flowering Time|url=|journal=Plant Physiology|volume=123|issue=1|pages=39–50|doi=10.1104/pp.123.1.39|pmid=10806223|pmc=1539253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other experiments have proven this  by exposing plants to extra red-light in the middle of the night. A short-day plant will not flower if light is turned on for a few minutes in the middle of the night and a long-day plant can flower if exposed to more red-light in the middle of the night.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Cryptochromes are another type of photoreceptor that is important in photoperiodism. Cryptochromes absorb blue light and UV-A. Cryptochromes entrain the circadian clock to light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Chentao|date=2005|title=The cryptochromes|url=|journal= Genome Biology|volume=6|issue=5|pages=220|doi=10.1186/gb-2005-6-5-220|pmid=15892880|pmc=1175950}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that both cryptochrome and phytochrome abundance relies on light and the amount of cryptochrome can change depending on day-length. This shows how important both of the photoreceptors are in regards to determining day-length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mockler|first=Todd|date=2003|title=Regulation of photoperiodic flowering by Arabidopsis photoreceptors|url=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=100 | issue = 4 |pages=2140–2145|doi=10.1073/pnas.0437826100|pmc=149972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, W. W. Garner and H. A. Allard published their discoveries on photoperiodism and felt it was the length of daylight that was critical,&lt;ref name=mauseth /&gt;&lt;ref name=GA&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Capon|first=Brian|title=Botany for Gardeners|year=2005|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0-88192-655-2|publisher=Timber Publishing|location=Portland, OR|pages=148–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was later discovered that the length of the night was the controlling factor.&lt;ref name=h1&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hamner, K.C. |author2=Bonner, J. |year=1938|title=Photoperiodism in relation to hormones as factors in floral initiation and development|journal=Botanical Gazette|volume=100|issue=2|pages=388–431|jstor=2471641|doi=10.1086/334793}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=h2&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hamner, K.C.|year=1940|title=Interrelation of light and darkness in photoperiodic induction|journal=Botanical Gazette|volume=101|issue=3|pages=658–87|jstor=2472399|doi=10.1086/334903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photoperiodic flowering plants are classified as ''long-day plants'' or ''short-day plants'' even though night is the critical factor because of the initial misunderstanding about daylight being the controlling factor. Along with long-day plants and short-day plants, there are plants that fall into a "dual-day length category". These plants are either long-short-day plants (LSDP) or short-long-day plants (SLDP). LSDPs flower after a series of long days followed by short days whereas SLDPs flower after a series of short days followed by long days.&lt;ref name="Taiz"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taiz|first1=Lincoln|last2=Zeiger|first2=Eduardo|last3=Møller|first3=Ian|last4=Murphy|first4=Angus|title=Plant Physiology and Development|date=2015|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc.|location=Sunderland, MA|isbn=978-1-60535-353-1|edition=Sixth}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Each plant has a different length critical photoperiod, or critical night length.&lt;ref name=mauseth /&gt;

Modern biologists believe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Andrés |first=Fernando |last2=Galbraith |first2=David W. |last3=Talón |first3=Manuel |last4=Domingo |first4=Concha |date=2009-08-12 |title=Analysis of PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 Sheds Light on the Role of Phytochromes in Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice |journal=Plant Physiology |volume=151 |issue=2 |pages=681–690 |doi=10.1104/pp.109.139097|pmc=2754645 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that it is the coincidence of the active forms of phytochrome or cryptochrome, created by light during the daytime, with the rhythms of the [[circadian clock]] that allows plants to measure the length of the night. Other than flowering, photoperiodism in plants includes the growth of stems or roots during certain seasons and the loss of leaves. Artificial lighting can be used to induce extra-long days.&lt;ref name=mauseth /&gt;

=== Long-day plants ===
Long-day plants flower when the night length falls below their critical photoperiod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=517|title=Plant Structure and Function|last1=Starr|first1=Cecie|last2=Taggart|first2=Ralph|last3=Evers|first3=Christine|last4=Starr|first4=Lisa|volume=4|edition=13th|publisher=Brooks/Cole|isbn=978-1-111-58068-1|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plants typically flower in the [[northern hemisphere]] during late spring or early summer as days are getting longer. In the northern hemisphere, the longest day of the year (summer solstice) is on or about 21 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gooley|first=Tristan|title=The Natural Navigator|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-7535-2311-7|date=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that date, days grow shorter (i.e. nights grow longer) until 21 December (the winter solstice). This situation is reversed in the southern hemisphere (i.e., longest day is 21 December and shortest day is 21 June).&lt;ref name=mauseth /&gt;&lt;ref name=GA /&gt;

Some long-day obligate plants are:
* [[Dianthus caryophyllus|Carnation]] (''Dianthus'')
* [[Hyoscyamus niger|Henbane]] (''Hyoscyamus'')
* [[Oat]] (''Avena'')

Some long-day facultative plants are:
* [[Pea]] (''Pisum sativum)
* [[Barley]] (''Hordeum vulgare'')
* [[Lettuce]] (''Lactuca sativa'')
* [[Wheat]] (''Triticum aestivum'')

=== Short-day plants ===
Short-day plants flower when the night lengths exceed their critical photoperiod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=BSCS Biology|publisher=BSCS|edition=9|page=519|isbn=978-0-7872-9008-5|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; They cannot flower under short nights or if a pulse of artificial light is shone on the plant for several minutes during the night; they require a continuous period of darkness before floral development can begin. Natural nighttime light, such as moonlight or lightning, is not of sufficient brightness or duration to interrupt flowering.&lt;ref name=mauseth /&gt;&lt;ref name=GA /&gt;

In general, short-day (i.e.long-night) plants flower as days grow shorter (and nights grow longer) after 21 June in the northern hemisphere, which is during summer or fall. The length of the dark period required to induce flowering differs among species and varieties of a species.

Photoperiodism affects flowering by inducing the shoot to produce floral buds instead of leaves and lateral buds.

Some short-day facultative plants are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Hamlyn G.|title=Plants and Microclimate: A Quantitative Approach to Environmental Plant Physiology|page=225|isbn=978-0-521-42524-7|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Day-neutral plants ===
Day-neutral plants, such as [[cucumber]]s, [[rose]]s, and [[tomato]]es, do not initiate flowering based on photoperiodism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meneely|first=Philip|title=Genetic Analysis: Genes, Genomes, and Networks in Eukaryotes|page=373|edition=2|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-968126-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they may initiate flowering after attaining a certain overall developmental stage or age, or in response to alternative environmental stimuli, such as [[vernalisation]] (a period of low temperature).&lt;ref name=mauseth /&gt;&lt;ref name=GA /&gt;

== Animal ==
{{anchor|In animals}}
Daylength, and thus knowledge of the season of the year, is vital to many animals. A number of biological and behavioural changes are dependent on this knowledge. Together with temperature changes, photoperiod provokes changes in the color of fur and feathers, migration, entry into [[hibernation]], [[animal sexual behavior|sexual behaviour]], and even the resizing of sexual organs.

The singing frequency of birds such as the [[Domestic Canary|canary]] depends on the photoperiod. In the spring, when the photoperiod increases (more daylight), the male canary's testes grow. As the testes grow, more androgens are secreted and song frequency increases. During autumn, when the photoperiod decreases (less daylight), the male canary's testes regress and androgen levels drop dramatically, resulting in decreased singing frequency. Not only is singing frequency dependent on the photoperiod but the song repertoire is also. The long photoperiod of spring results in a greater song repertoire. Autumn's shorter photoperiod results in a reduction in song repertoire. These behavioral photoperiod changes in male canaries are caused by changes in the song center of the brain. As the photoperiod increases, the [[high vocal center]] (HVC) and the robust nucleus of the [[archistriatum]] (RA) increase in size. When the photoperiod decreases, these areas of the brain regress.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Randy J. (2005) An Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology (p.189). Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mammals, daylength is registered in the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), which is informed by [[photosensitive ganglion cell|retinal light-sensitive ganglion cells]], which are not involved in vision. The information travels through the [[retinohypothalamic tract]] (RHT). Some mammals are highly seasonal, while humans' seasonality is largely believed to be [[evolutionary baggage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/stories/2009/2762261.htm |title=Extra-retinal photo receptors |accessdate=2010-05-28 |last=Foster |first=Russell |author2=Williams, Robyn |date=5 December 2009 |format=Interview |work=Science Show |publisher=ABC Radio National |quote=...we have the evolutionary baggage of showing seasonality but we're not entirely sure what the mechanism is.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{relevance inline|date=April 2018}}

'''Procatalepsis''', also called '''prolepsis''' or '''prebuttal''', is a [[figure of speech]] in which the speaker raises an objection to their own argument and then immediately answers it. By doing so, they hope to strengthen their argument by dealing with possible counter-arguments before their audience can raise them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dialog Theory for Critical Argumentation|author=Douglas N. Walton|pages=106|publisher=John Benjamins B.V.|isbn=978-90-272-1885-8|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[rhetoric]] anticipating future responses and answering possible objections will set up one's argument for a strong defense. The ''Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' states that there are three distinct theoretical uses of prolepsis: argumentation, literary discussion, and conjunction with narratological analyses of the order of events.&lt;ref name="ColumbiaDict"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Childers|first1=Joseph|last2=Hentzi|first2=Gary|title=The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism|year=1995|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-07243-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2013}}

In argumentation, procatalepsis is used to answer the opponent's possible objections before they can be made. In literary discussion, procatalepsis is used as a figure of speech in which a description is used before it is strictly applicable. Sayings such as "I'm a dead man" exemplify the suggestion of a state that has not yet occurred. In [[Narratology|narratological analyses]] prolepsis can be used with the order of events and presentation of events in texts. This refers to the study of narrative in respect to "flash-forwards" in which a future event serves as an interruption of the present time of the text.&lt;ref name="ColumbiaDict" /&gt;

Example:
* "It is difficult to see how a pilot boat could be completely immune to capsizing or plunging, but pilot boat design criteria must meet the needs of the industry and pilotage authorities."

As a linguistic phenomenon found in both classic and current languages, prolepsis is described as the construction whereby the subject of a subordinate clause occurs by anticipation as an object in the main clause.&lt;ref&gt;Panhuis, Dirk. "Prolepsis in Greek as a Discourse Strategy." ''Glotta'' 62.1/2 (1984): n. pag. JSTOR. Web. 30 Sept. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this definition is strictly technical as used in linguistics, it has also been used to describe the more general phenomenon of objects or phrases appearing earlier than intended or expected. 

==Other examples in rhetoric and argument== 

Procatalepsis as a rhetorical technique is also related to and used in other forms and techniques. A [[hypophora]] is described as a figure of speech in which a speaker raises a question then immediately answers it. Since these questions are often raised as possible dissenting opinions or audience objections, the hypophora can be said to be a use of procatalepsis.

The [[Straw Man]] argument, an informal fallacy in which one misrepresents an opposing argument in order to further one's own, can serve as an example of misused procatalepsis. In this fallacy, the rhetor misconstrues the words, arguments, or views of an opponent, most often on purpose, to facilitate rebuttal or create a false impression on the audience. This, in effect, creates a "straw man" against which the rhetor will then defend and strengthen his or her argument. &lt;ref&gt;Douglas Walton, "The Straw Man Fallacy." ''In Logic and Argumentation'', ed. Johan van Bentham, Frans H. van Eemeren, Rob Grootendorst and Frank Veltman. Amsterdam, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, North-Holland, 1996. pp. 115-128&lt;/ref&gt;

The correct use of procatalepsis is still an effective tactic in an argument, since it allows the rhetor to answer opponents before they have a chance to raise the counterargument themselves. This "inoculation" can be subtle, but also signaled rather obviously (e.g. "Now, my opponent might argue that X. But, as you can see, Y"). The unique benefit to this more overt approach is twofold: The rhetor successfully replies to an opposing argument or audience objection, but also builds a sort of trust and authority with the audience. Then, if the opponent does in fact bring up the argument that the rhetor anticipated, the rhetor appears to be correct not only in the subject matter of the argument but in the general course of the argument itself.

==Inoculation==
Procatalepsis is linked to the rhetorical term [[Inoculation theory|inoculation]]. The ''Encyclopedia of Communication Theory'' describes this rhetorical technique in relation to its medical definition: introducing small doses of viruses to the body in order to build up immunization.&lt;ref name="EnclopedComm"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Littlejohn|first1=Stephen W.|last2=Foss|first2=Karen A.|title=Encyclopedia of Communication Theory|year=2009|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-5937-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2013}} In rhetoric, the small dose of the threat parallels to the awareness of the opposing argument that is used to build up one's argument by defense in prolepsis. William McGuire proposed the Inoculation Theory in 1964 to challenge attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that make an argument more resistant when exposed to counter views in weakened, small doses. Persuasion research in the 1950s found that providing two sides of an issue created a greater resistance to later arguments.&lt;ref name="EnclopedComm" /&gt; This is closely related to the rhetorical use of procatalepsis as an opposing argument to defend the intended view of the argument.

Inoculation and procatalepsis are both present in certain courtroom situations, as described in the ''Encyclopedia of Communication Theory''. An attorney may set up their defense by disclaiming the negative views or classifications of the accused as untrue: "The prosecutor will call Ms. Jones evil, a bad mother, and a poor member of society, but these labels are not true. I will prove to you their inaccuracy." When the prosecutor asserts an attack on Ms. Jones' character, the jury is already prepared and expecting to hear it and they may question or even discount these accusations. The goal is not to overwhelm the audience members with anticipation or the opposing view of the argument, but rather to use the inverse argument to one's advantage through strategic rhetoric.&lt;ref name="EnclopedComm" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3649">{{short description|The rate of generation of biomass in an ecosystem}}
In [[ecology]], '''productivity''' refers to the rate of generation of [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] in an [[ecosystem]].  It is usually expressed in units of [[mass]] per unit surface (or volume) per unit time, for instance [[gram]]s per square metre per [[day]] (g m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; d&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).  The mass unit may relate to [[dry matter]] or to the mass of [[carbon-based life|carbon]] generated.  Productivity of [[autotroph]]s such as [[plant]]s is called '''primary productivity''', while that of [[heterotroph]]s such as [[animal]]s is called '''secondary productivity'''.&lt;ref name=allaby&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=Allaby |title=A Dictionary of Ecology |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t14.e4512 |accessdate=2009-12-03 |edition=Third |year=2006 |origyear=1994 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=978-0-19-860905-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary production==
{{main|Primary production}}
[[Primary production]] is the synthesis of new organic material from inorganic molecules such as [[H2O|{{chem|H|2|O}}]] and [[CO2|{{chem|C|O|2}}]].  It is dominated by the process of [[photosynthesis]] which uses [[sunlight]] to synthesise organic molecules such as [[sugar]]

==Secondary production==
Secondary production is the generation of [[biomass]] of [[heterotroph]]ic (consumer) organisms in a system.  This is driven by the transfer of organic material between [[trophic level]]s, and represents the quantity of new [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] created through the use of [[Assimilation (biology)|assimilated]] food.  Secondary production is sometimes defined to only include consumption of primary producers by [[herbivory|herbivorous]] consumers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filaman.ifm-geomar.de/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=secondary+production&amp;language=english&amp;sc=is |title=Definition of term: "Secondary production" |author= |date= |work=The Glossary Table |publisher=[[FishBase]] |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with tertiary production referring to [[Carnivory|carnivorous]] consumers),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filaman.ifm-geomar.de/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=tertiary+production&amp;language=english&amp;sc=is |title=Definition of term: "Tertiary production" |author= |date= |work=The Glossary Table |publisher=[[FishBase]] |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is more commonly defined to include all biomass generation by heterotrophs.&lt;ref name=allaby/&gt;

Organisms responsible for secondary production include animals, [[protist]]s, [[fungi]] and many bacteria.

Secondary production can be estimated through a number of different methods including increment summation, removal summation, the instantaneous growth method and the Allen curve method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Allen | first=K.R. | year=1951 | title=The Horokiwi Stream: A study of a trout population | journal=New Zealand Marine Department Fisheries Bulletin | volume=10 | pages=1–238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice between these methods will depend on the assumptions of each and the ecosystem under study.  For instance, whether [[generational cohort|cohorts]] should be distinguished, whether linear mortality can be assumed and whether [[Population dynamics|population growth]] is exponential.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14022">'''Protein chemical shift prediction''' is a branch of biomolecular [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] that aims to accurately calculate protein [[chemical shift]]s from protein coordinates. Protein chemical shift prediction was first attempted in the late 1960s using semi-empirical methods applied to protein structures solved by [[X-ray crystallography]].&lt;ref name=pmid21241884 /&gt;  Since that time protein chemical shift prediction has evolved to employ much more sophisticated approaches including [[quantum mechanics]], [[machine learning]] and empirically derived chemical shift hypersurfaces.&lt;ref name=pmid21241884 /&gt; The most recently developed methods exhibit remarkable precision and accuracy.

==Protein chemical shifts==
NMR [[chemical shift]]s are often called the mileposts of [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]]. Chemists have used chemical shifts for more than 50 years as highly reproducible, easily measured parameters to map out the covalent structure of small organic molecules. Indeed, the sensitivity of NMR [[chemical shift]]s to the type and character of neighbouring [[atom]]s, combined with their reasonably predictable tendencies has made them invaluable for both deciphering and describing the structure of thousands of newly synthesized or newly isolated compounds&lt;ref name=pmid21241884&gt;{{cite journal |title=Interpreting protein chemical shift data|last=Wishart|first=DS|journal=Progress in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy|date=Feb 2011|volume=58|pages=62–87|pmid=21241884|doi=10.1016/j.pnmrs.2010.07.004|issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance of protein chemical shift prediction==
Predicted or estimated protein chemical shifts can be used to assist with the chemical shift assignment process. This is especially true if a similar (or identical) protein structure has been solved by X-ray crystallography.  In this case, the three-dimensional structure can be used to estimate what the NMR chemical shifts should be and thereby simplify the process of assigning the experimentally observed chemical shifts.  Predicted/estimated protein chemical shifts can also be used to identify incorrect or mis-assignments, to correct mis-referenced or incorrectly referenced chemical shifts, to optimize protein structures via chemical shift refinement and to identify the relative contributions of different electronic or geometric effects to nucleus-specific shifts.&lt;ref name=pmid21241884 /&gt; Protein chemical shifts can also be used to identify secondary structures, to estimate [[backbone chain|backbone]] torsion angles, to determine the location of [[aromatic rings]], to assess [[cysteine]] oxidation states, to estimate solvent exposure and to measure [[backbone chain|backbone]] flexibility.&lt;ref name=pmid21448735 /&gt;

==Progress in chemical shift prediction programs==
Significant progress in [[chemical shift]] prediction has been made through continuous improvements in our understanding of the key physico-chemical factors contributing to chemical shift changes.  These improvements have also been helped along through significant computational advancements

The first is based on using sequence/structure alignment against protein [[chemical shift]] databases, the second is based on directly calculating shifts from atomic coordinates, and the third is based on using a combination of the two approaches.&lt;ref name=pmid21241884 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid21448735 /&gt;

*Predicting shifts from coordinate data / structure: 
**Semi-classical methods: employ empirical equations derived from [[classical physics]] and experimental data&lt;ref name=pmid21241884 /&gt;
**Quantum mechanical (QM) methods:  employ [[density functional theory]] (DFT)&lt;ref name=pmid21241884 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid12766419 /&gt;
**Empirical methods: rely on using [[chemical shift]] ‘‘hypersurfaces" or related "structure/shift" tables&lt;ref name=pmid21241884 /&gt;
*Hybrid Methods: combining the above two methods&lt;ref name=pmid21241884 /&gt;

==The emergence of hybrid prediction methods==
By early 2000, several research groups realized that protein chemical shifts could be more efficiently and accurately calculated by combining different methods together as shown in Figure 1. This led to the development of several programs and web servers that rapidly calculate protein chemical shifts when provided with protein coordinate data.&lt;ref name=pmid21241884 /&gt; These “hybrid” programs, along with some of their features and URLs, are listed below in Table 1.

==Performance comparison of modern protein chemical shift prediction programs==
This table (Figure 2) lists the correlation coefficients between the experimentally observed backbone chemical shifts and the calculated/predicted backbone shifts for different chemical shift predictors using an identical test set of 61 test proteins.

==Coverage and speed==
Different methods have different levels of coverage and rates of calculation.  Some methods only calculate or predict chemical shifts for backbone atoms (6 atom types).  Some calculate chemical shifts for backbone and certain side chain atoms (C and N only) and still others are able to calculate shifts for all atoms (40 atom types).  For chemical shift refinement there is a need for rapid calculation as thousands of structures are generated during a molecular dynamics or simulated annealing run and their chemical shifts must be calculated equally rapidly.

The '''Society for Research on Biological Rhythms''' ('''SRBR''') is an international [[Chronobiology|chronobiological]] research society with three key goals: (1) to promote the advancement and dissemination of basic and applied research in all aspects of biological rhythms; (2) to enhance the education and training of students and researchers in the field; (3) to foster interdisciplinary communication and an international exchange of ideas.The society holds biennial meetings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/a-blog-around-the-clock/clocks-metabolism-evolution-toward-an-integrative-chronobiology/|title=Clocks, metabolism, evolution - toward an integrative chronobiology|last=Zivkovic|first=Bora|date=May 30, 2013|website=Scientific American|archiveurl=https://archive.is/eNIT4?url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/a-blog-around-the-clock/clocks-metabolism-evolution-toward-an-integrative-chronobiology/|archivedate=May 14, 2017 |deadurl=no |accessdate=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and informal gatherings, and participates in peer-reviewed science and evidence-based policymaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/01/170123094549.htm|title=What is good quality sleep?

The society has its own official journal, the [[Journal of Biological Rhythms]].&lt;ref name="journals.sagepub.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/home/jbr|title=Journal of Biological Rhythms {{!}} SAGE Journals|website=journals.sagepub.com|language=en|accessdate=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through its journal, website, meetings and exchanges the society engages scientists of all backgrounds and nationalities. It advocates the need for funding in research areas in biological rhythms, such as sleep, and supports other research efforts such as the [[National Institutes of Health]] and [[National Science Foundation]].

== Founding and Early History ==
In 1986, Benjamin Rusak founded the ''[[Journal of Biological Rhythms]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Circadian Clock|last=Albrecht|first=Urs|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4419-1261-9|location=|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rusak wanted an accompanying society that would hold meetings concerning research on biological rhythms, so he asked [[Fred W. Turek]] to organize the first meeting.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{Citation|last=ClockTool|title=Interview Fred W Turek|date=2017-01-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCwUUZpYGkc&amp;index=7&amp;list=PLsCe0pip0WjKMWbJUdD_D_71u5yj3Iw0m|accessdate=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society was officially founded on November 12, 1986 by Fred Turek, Dave Hudson, [[Joseph Takahashi|Joe Takahashi]], and [[Gene D. Block|Gene Block]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tenth Meeting, Society for Research on Biological Rhythms: Program and Abstracts.'' 1st ed. Sandestin: SRBR, 2006. Web. 13. Apr. 2017. https://srbr.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SRBR_2006_Program.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The society is sometimes cited as being founded in 1988, as this was when the first meeting occurred.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Colin Pittendrigh]], Turek's Ph.D. adviser, and one of the fathers of the field, was initially opposed to the society, worrying that it would have an isolating effect on the field rather than connecting it to related disciplines. Pittendrigh came around to the idea after the successful first meeting. Turek, however, believed that the field had advanced and diversified enough to justify a meeting that would unify the diverse field. Turek had been involved with the [[Endocrine Society]], a research society that was 70 years old by 1986. He thought about this well established organisation when working in the early phases of SRBR, hoping to create a society with the ability to make a lasting impact.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt; The first meeting was held at the Wild Dunes Resort and Conference Center in Charleston, SC, in May 1988. The Plenary Lecture at the first meeting was given by [[Michael Menaker]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''First Meeting, Society for Research on Biological Rhythms: Program and Abstracts.'' 1st ed. Charleston: SRBR, 1988. Web. 13. Apr. 2017. https://srbr.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SRBR_1988_ProgramAbstracts.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meetings ==
Meetings for the Society of Research on Biological Rhythms occur once every two years, typically in May or June. The location of the meeting is determined by the President of the SRBR with the help of existing members. Meetings typically last four or five days and are open to all registered members. The meetings serve as a forum to share the latest research in biological rhythms, with hundreds of chronobiologist from around the world presenting at poster sessions and lectures. According to 2016 President Paul Hardin, the meeting is "an exceptional forum for hearing the latest cutting-edge research, reengaging with colleagues from years past, and exchanging ideas that will shape the future of the field with a talented and diverse group of chronobiologists from around the globe."&lt;ref&gt;''SRBR 2016.'' 1st ed. Palm Harbor: SRBR, 2016. Web. 13. Apr. 2017. https://srbr.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SRBR-2016-Program-Book-with-abstracts.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The last day of the meeting also features a keynote speaker referred to as the Pittendrigh/Aschoff speaker, named after notable chronobiologist [[Colin Pittendrigh]] and [[Jürgen Aschoff]]. Notable past Pittendrigh/Aschoff speakers include: Fred Turek, Joe Takahashi, and [[Michael W. Young|Michael Young]].

In addition to lectures and poster sessions, the meeting also serves as an opportunity to review the accomplishments of the society and its members over the previous two years, provide updates on the ''Journal for Biological Rhythms'', introduce the incoming administration, and officially transfer the presidency to the president-elect.

==Awards==
The Society for Research on Biological Rhythms offers various awards and fellowships to researchers and trainees with diverse backgrounds from all over the world. Researchers and trainees must be participating in SRBR's biennial meeting to be considered.

===Travel Fellowships &amp; Awards===
* '''International Travel Fellowships''' - This fellowship covers part of the travel costs for selected researchers and trainees from international countries. SRBR believes in the invaluable contributions the participation of a diverse group of researchers brings to its meetings. Trainees from [https://owc.parthenonmgmt.com/owncloud/index.php/s/pM4WZ8IPb85OOHL economically disadvantaged countries] are especially encouraged [https://srbr.org/meetings/upcoming-meeting/awards/ to apply]. 
* '''Diversity Travel Award''' - The SRBR provides awards funded by the [https://www.nih.gov NIH] to cover part of the travel costs for selected researchers and trainees from certain backgrounds. Researchers with disabilities or from underrepresented backgrounds in the chronobiology field are strongly encouraged [https://srbr.org/meetings/upcoming-meeting/awards/ to apply].
* '''Trainee Travel Award''' - The SRBR gives two different awards to trainees based on excellence and merit: the Trainee Research Excellence Award and Trainee Research Merit Award. All submitted abstracts that fulfill criteria are automatically reviewed.

===Junior Faculty Research Award===
This award is given to principal investigators, usually newly independent researchers, for their exemplary work in the [[chronobiology]] field. Those eligible must be principal investigators at the Assistant Professor level (tenure-track) and must have published at least one notable paper on their research as a corresponding author.

Only those nominated by a SRBR member, excluding oneself or former lab members, are considered for this award.

===Directors' Award===
The SRBR gives Directors' Awards to honor those who have made significant contributions to the [[chronobiology]] field through their service, innovative research, and/or mentorship.

== Publications ==

=== Journal of Biological Rhythms ===
The [[Journal of Biological Rhythms]] has been the official journal for the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms since the founding of both in 1986. The JBR publishes scholarly articles, original research, and reviews on a variety of topics all centering around periodicity in organisms. The journal focuses on circadian and seasonal rhythms, but articles about other biological periods are published as well. A variety of approaches are explored by the journal including: genetic, behavioral, modeling, and clinical trials. In 2015 SAGE Publications gave JBR a five-year impact factor of 3.167 and a ranking of 19/86 in biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/journal-of-biological-rhythms/journal200933#description|title=Journal of Biological Rhythms {{!}} SAGE Publications Inc|website=us.sagepub.com |accessdate=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impact rating is a measure of how frequently the average article from the journal is cited. JBR is a member of the [[Committee on Publication Ethics]].&lt;ref name="journals.sagepub.com"/&gt;

=== JBRish ===
[https://srbr.org/publications/jbrish/ JBRish] is a collection of editorials and letters written by Martin Zatz while he was editor of the [[Journal of Biological Rhythms]]. These are not scholarly articles about the science of biological rhythms; instead they focus on various aspects of life in academia and science. Some pieces are comedic or satirical in nature, and others are more serious. The collectors of the pieces, Anna Wirz-Justice and Irving Zucker, describe the selections as, “wistful, others poignant or trenchant, and an occasional one offers advice. They not infrequently document and lampoon trends and human foibles.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://srbr.org/publications/jbrish/|title=JBRish {{!}} SRBR: Society for Research on Biological Rhythms|website=srbr.org|language=en-US|accessdate=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Newsletter ===
The Society for Research on Biological Rhythms publishes a newsletter two to three times a year. It contains a letter from the President of the society, recent developments in the field, and society business. The society business often includes programs for meetings, recent grants, and newsworthy events involving members. Recent newsletters can be viewed by non-members and can be found on the SRBR's [https://srbr.org/publications/newsletter/ website].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://srbr.org/publications/newsletter/|title=Newsletter {{!}} SRBR: Society for Research on Biological Rhythms|website=srbr.org|language=en-US|accessdate=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10172">{{short description|The sixth of 17 Sustainable Development Goals calling for clean water and sanitation for all people by 2030}}
'''Sustainable Development Goal 6''' ('''SDG6''' or '''SDG 6'''), one of 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] established by the UN in 2015. It calls for clean water and [[sanitation]] for all people. The official wording is: "Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all."&lt;ref name="SDG6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-6-clean-water-and-sanitation.html|title=Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal has eight targets to be achieved by at least 2030. Progress toward the targets will be measured by using eleven "indicators."     

SDG6 is closely linked with other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  For example, improving sanitation also helps make cities more sustainable (Goal 11). Sanitation improvements can lead to more jobs (Goal 8) which would also lead to economic growth (Goal 8).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  SDG6 progress improves [[health]] (Goal 3) and [[social justice]] (Goal 16).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/4538pressowg13.pdf|title=Press release – UN General Assembly’s Open Working Group proposes sustainable development goals|date=19 July 2014|website=Sustainabledevelopment.un.org|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Targets==

SDG 6 has eight targets. Six of them are to be achieved by the year 2030, one by the year 2020 and one has no target year.&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-6-clean-water-and-sanitation/targets/|title=Goal 6 Targets|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations Development Programme|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the targets also has one or two indicators which will be used to measure progress. In total there are 11 indicators for SDG6.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg6|title=SDGs|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first three targets relate to drinking [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]]:&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets" /&gt; 

# By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable [[drinking water]] for all
# By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable [[sanitation]] and [[hygiene]] for all and end [[open defecation]], paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations
# By 2030, improve water quality by reducing [[Water pollution|pollution]], eliminating dumping and minimizing release of [[Dangerous goods|hazardous chemicals]] and materials, halving the proportion of untreated [[wastewater]] and substantially increasing [[Reclaimed water|recycling and safe reuse]] globally

Safe drinking water and hygienic [[toilets]] protect people from disease and enable societies to be more productive economically. Attending school and work without disruption supports education and employment, both of which are the foundation of alleviating poverty. Therefore, toilets at school and at the work place are included in the second target ("achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all"). Equitable sanitation and hygiene solutions address the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, such as the elderly or people with disabilities.

Water sources are better preserved if open defecation is ended and sustainable sanitation systems are implemented. Preserving natural sources of water is very important so as to achieve universal access to safe and affordable [[drinking water]]. Therefore, one target aims to reduce [[water pollution]] by eliminating dumping and minimizing the release of hazardous chemicals and untreated [[wastewater]]. The potential for recycling and safe [[Reclaimed water|reuse of wastewater]] is also mentioned.&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets" /&gt;

==Indicators==
[[File:Pit latrines in Zambia (3233256285).jpg|thumb|Unimproved sanitation example: [[pit latrine]] without slab in [[Lusaka]], Zambia]]
The main indicator for the sanitation target is the "Proportion of population using [[Improved sanitation|safely managed sanitation]] services, including a hand-washing facility with soap and water".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The current statistic in the 2017 baseline estimate by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] (JMP) is that 4.5 billion people currently do not have safely managed sanitation.&lt;ref name="JMP2017"&gt;WHO and UNICEF (2017) [https://washdata.org/reports Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines]. Geneva: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  The JMP is a joint program of [[UNICEF]] and [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and compiles data to monitor SDG6 progress. 

The definition of safely managed sanitation service is: "Use of improved facilities that are not shared with other households and where excreta are safely disposed of in situ or transported and treated offsite."&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt;{{rp|6}} Improved sanitation facilities are those designed to hygienically separate excreta from human contact.&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

==Links with other SDGs==
The SDGs are all interlinked. [[WASH]] experts have stated that without progress on Goal 6, the other goals and targets cannot be achieved.&lt;ref name="IPSnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2015/10/opinion-sanitation-water-hygiene-for-all-cannot-wait-for-2030/|title=Opinion: “Sanitation, Water &amp; Hygiene For All” Cannot Wait for 2030|last1=Rao Gupta|first1=Geeta|date=October 2015|website=Inter Press|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="batty"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.devex.com/news/beyond-the-sdgs-how-to-deliver-water-and-sanitation-to-everyone-everywhere-86975|title=Beyond the SDGs: How to deliver water and sanitation to everyone, everywhere|last1=Batty|first1=Margaret|date=25 September 2015|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, accomplishing the other SDGs will require assuring clean water and sanitation for all as stated in SDG6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/susana-publications/details/2859|title=Sustainable sanitation and the SDGs: interlinkages and opportunities|last=SuSanA|first=|date=2017|website=|publisher=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance, Eschborn, Germany|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sanitation systems with a [[Reuse of excreta|resource recovery]] and reuse focus are getting increased attention and can contribute to achieving at least fourteen of the SDGs, especially in an urban context.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.trust.org/item/20170919145350-bovq7|title=The rise of the sanitation economy: how business can help solve a global crisis|last=Paranipe|first=Nitin|date=14 November 2017|website=Thomson Reuters Foundation News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andersson|first=Kim|last2=Dickin|first2=Sarah|last3=Rosemarin|first3=Arno|date=2016-12-08|title=Towards "Sustainable" Sanitation: Challenges and Opportunities in Urban Areas|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/8/12/1289|journal=Sustainability|language=en|volume=8|issue=12|pages=1289|doi=10.3390/su8121289}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Recovering the resources embedded in excreta and wastewater (like nutrients, water and energy) contributes to achieving Goal 12 ([[sustainable consumption]] and [[sustainable production|production]]) and Goal 2 (end hunger). 

Ensuring adequate sanitation and wastewater management along the entire value chain in cities contributes to Goal 11 ([[sustainable cities]] and communities), Goal 1 (no poverty) and Goal 8 (decent work and economic growth).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==Organizations==

The [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] (SuSanA) works on sanitation issues as a global network of 9000 individuals and 300 partner organizations. Global organizations such as [[Oxfam]], [[UNICEF]], [[WaterAid]] and many small NGOs as well as universities, research centres, private enterprises, government-owned entities etc. are all part of SuSanA and are dedicated to achieving SDG6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/about/vision-mission|title=Vision|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/library/details/2715|title=Contribution of sustainable sanitation to the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development - SuSanA Vision Document 2017|last=|first=|date=|year=2017|website=|publisher=SuSanA, Eschborn, Germany|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ending [[open defecation]] will require provision of toilets and sanitation for 2.6 billion people as well as [[Behavior change (public health)|behavior change]] of the population. This will require cooperation between governments, civil society and the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/982187046|title=Beyond the bottom line: integrating sustainability into business and management practice|last=Kellogg|first=Diane M.|publisher=Greenleaf Publishing|others=Gudić, Milenko,, Tan, Tay Keong,, Flynn, Patricia M.,|year=2017|isbn=9781783533275|location=Saltaire, UK|pages=|chapter=The Global Sanitation Crisis: A Role for Business|oclc=982187046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sebastiano del Piombo, The Raising of Lazarus.jpg|thumb|[[Sebastiano del Piombo]]'s ''[[The Raising of Lazarus (Sebastiano del Piombo)|The Raising of Lazarus]]'', transferred from panel to canvas in 1771.&lt;ref name=lazarus/&gt;]]
The practice of conserving an unstable [[panel painting|painting on panel]] by transferring it from its original decayed, worm-eaten, cracked or distorted wood support to canvas or a new panel has been practised since the eighteenth century. It has now been largely superseded by improved methods of  wood conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Structural Conservation of Panel Paintings:Proceedings of a symposium at the J. Paul Getty Museum |editor1-first= Kathleen|editor1-last= Dardes |editor2-first=Andrea|editor2-last= Rothe|publisher=The Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|volume=3|page=189|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/panelpaintings.html#download}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice evolved in [[Naples]] and [[Cremona]] in 1711–1725, and reached France by the middle of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Structural Conservation of Panel Paintings:Proceedings of a symposium at the J. Paul Getty Museum |editor1-first= Kathleen|editor1-last= Dardes |editor2-first=Andrea|editor2-last= Rothe|publisher=The Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|volume=3|pages=268–9|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/panelpaintings.html#download}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was especially widely practiced in the second half of the 19th century. Similar techniques are used to transfer [[fresco]]s. Oil paintings on [[canvas]] often [[Lining of paintings|receive additional support or are transferred to a new backing]].

==Methods==
The process is described by Henry Mogford  in his '' Handbook for the Preservation of Pictures''. Smooth sheets of paper were pasted over the painted surface of the panel, and a layer of [[muslin]] over that. The panel was then fixed, face down, to a table, and the wood planed away from the back  until it was "as thin as a plane may safely go", and the remainder scraped off with a sharp instrument such as a razor. The ground of the painting was then removed by solvents or scraping, until nothing remained but  a thin skin of colour,  pasted over with paper and held together by the muslin. A prepared canvas was then attached to the back of the paint layer, using the same method as was used for lining pictures. When the glue had dried, the  paper and muslin was removed by careful damping.&lt;ref name=mogford&gt;{{cite book|title= Handbook for the Preservation of Pictures|first=Henry|last=Mogford|edition=3rd|year=1851|pages=35–6|publisher= Winsor and Newton|location=London|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leading workshop carrying out the process in Paris in the eighteenth century was that of Jean-Louis Hacquin (d. 1783), who transferred many works in the French royal collection.  Transfers from the workshop have sometimes been found to have a layer of pieces of silk, or of sheets of paper between the paint layer and the new canvas. The workshop  was continued after  Hacquin’s death by his son, François-Toussaint Hacquin (1756–1832),  who transferred many paintings  taken to France from Italy during the Napoleonic period.&lt;ref name=lazarus &gt;{{cite journal|journal=National Gallery Technical Bulletin|volume=30|year=2009|title=Sebastiano del Piombo's Raising of Lazarus: A History of Change|first1=Jill|last1= Dunkerton|first2=Helen|last2= Howard|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/upload/pdf/dunkerton_howard2009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method, used by Hacquin's contemporary,  Jean-Michel Picault, dissolved the ground layer chemically, apparently with  fumes of [[nitrous oxide]], allowing the panel to be removed intact from the paint.&lt;ref name=lazarus/&gt; A later restorer, Marie-Jacob Godefroid is recorded as having achieved similar results by the use of steam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Getty Publications|title=Issues in the Conservation of Paintings|first1=David|last1= Bomford|first2=Mark|last2= Leonard,|year=2004|page=281|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywaDvCzGxpsC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA284&amp;dq|isbn=978-0-89236-781-8}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A less dramatic "partial transfer" tended to be used in Germany and Austria, in which a thin layer of the original wood was retained, and glued onto a new panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Structural Conservation of Panel Paintings:Proceedings of a symposium at the J. Paul Getty Museum |editor1-first= Kathleen|editor1-last= Dardes |editor2-first=Andrea|editor2-last= Rothe|publisher=The Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|volume=3|page=222|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/panelpaintings.html#download}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usuda was the first deep-space antenna constructed with beam-waveguide technology.  Although this construction dramatically simplifies installation and maintenance of electronics, it was previously thought to offer poor noise performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Similar huge antennas are used by the deep space networks of the [[NASA Deep Space Network|USA]], [[Chinese Deep Space Network|China]], [[Soviet Deep Space Network|Russia]], [[ESTRACK|Europe]], and [[Indian Deep Space Network|India]].

Because the 64 meter antenna is getting old, JAXA is building a new antenna nearby.  This antenna will be slightly smaller (54 meters in diameter) but have better surface accuracy and hence be capable of working at the higher Ka-band frequencies.  This will increase the potential data throughput despite the smaller size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Toward a New Era of Deep Space Exploration: Kenji Numata, Project Manager, Ground Station for Deep Space Exploration and Telecommunication Project |url=http://global.jaxa.jp/article/2017/interview/vol98/ |publisher=JAXA |year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vinciane Despret''' is a Belgian [[philosopher of science]], associate professor, at the [[University of Liège]], [[Belgium]].

== Biography ==

Vinciane Despret first graduated in philosophy. She studied psychology and graduated in 1991. She is most known for having provided a reflexive account on [[ethologists]], observing babblers in the [[Negev]] desert and the way they would interpret those birds' complex dance moves.&lt;ref&gt;A short profile introduction is to be found on the website of her editor, "La Découverte", in Paris: http://www.editionsladecouverte.fr/catalogue/index-Les_faiseuses_d_histoires-9782359250473.html&lt;/ref&gt;

She is considered to be a foundational thinker in what has now became the field of [[animal studies]].&lt;ref&gt;For instance, this podcast of Despret interviewing the primatologist [[Thelma Rowell]] — http://backdoorbroadcasting.net/2011/06/vinciane-despret-experimenting-with-politics-and-happiness-through-sheep-cows-and-pigs/&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, at the heart of her work lies the question of the relationship between observers and the observed during the conduct of scientific research.

Despret affiliates herself to such critical thinkers in philosophy and anthropology of science as [[Isabelle Stengers]], [[Donna Haraway]] and [[Bruno Latour]]. She undertakes a critical understanding of how science is fabricated, following scientists doing fieldwork and the way they actively create links and specific relationships to their objects of study.

Although she has mostly published books in French, some of her works are planned to be published in English in the course of late 2012.

'''Zooplankton''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|oʊ|.|ə|ˌ|p|l|æ|ŋ|k|t|ən|,_|ˈ|z|uː|(|ə|)|-|,_|ˈ|z|oʊ|oʊ|-}},{{refn|{{cite web |url=https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/zooplankton |title=zooplankton - definition of zooplankton in English from the Oxford dictionary |publisher=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |access-date=2016-01-20 }}}} {{IPAc-en|ˌ|z|oʊ|.|ə|ˈ|p|l|æ|ŋ|k|t|ən|,_|-|t|ɒ|n}}){{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Zooplankton}}}} are [[heterotroph]]ic (sometimes [[detritivore|detritivorous]]) [[plankton]] (cf. [[phytoplankton]]). Plankton are organisms drifting in [[ocean]]s, [[sea]]s, and bodies of [[fresh water]]. The word ''zooplankton'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] ''zoon'' ({{lang|grc|ζῴον}}), meaning "animal", and ''{{lang|grc-Latn|planktos}}'' ({{lang|grc|πλαγκτός}}), meaning "wanderer" or "drifter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Zooplankton is a categorization spanning a range of [[organism]] sizes including small [[protozoa]]ns and large [[metazoa]]ns.  It includes [[holoplankton]]ic organisms whose complete [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] lies within the plankton, as well as [[meroplankton]]ic organisms that spend part of their lives in the plankton before graduating to either the [[nekton]] or a [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]], [[benthos|benthic]] existence.  Although zooplankton are primarily transported by ambient water currents, many have [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]], used to avoid predators (as in [[diel vertical migration]]) or to increase prey encounter rate.

[[Ecology|Ecologically]] important protozoan zooplankton groups include the [[foraminifera]]ns, [[radiolaria]]ns and [[dinoflagellate]]s (the last of these are often [[mixotroph]]ic).  Important metazoan zooplankton include [[cnidaria]]ns such as [[jellyfish]] and the [[Portuguese Man o' War]]; [[crustacea]]ns such as [[copepod]]s, [[ostracod]]s, [[isopod]]s, [[amphipod]]s, [[mysids]] and [[krill]]; [[Chaetognatha|chaetognath]]s (arrow worms); [[Mollusca|molluscs]] such as [[pteropod]]s; and [[chordate]]s such as [[salp]]s and juvenile fish. This wide [[phylogeny|phylogenetic]] range includes a similarly wide range in feeding behavior: [[filter feeder|filter feeding]], [[predation]] and [[symbiosis]] with [[autotrophic]] [[phytoplankton]] as seen in corals.  Zooplankton feed on [[bacterioplankton]], phytoplankton, other zooplankton (sometimes [[Cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalistically]]), [[detritus]] (or [[marine snow]]) and even nektonic organisms.  As a result, zooplankton are primarily found in surface waters where food resources (phytoplankton or other zooplankton) are abundant.

Just as any species can be limited within a geographical region, so are zooplankton. However, species of zooplankton are not dispersed uniformly or randomly within a region of the ocean.  As with phytoplankton, ‘patches’ of zooplankton species exist throughout the ocean. Though few physical barriers exist above the [[mesopelagic]], specific species of zooplankton are strictly restricted by salinity and temperature gradients; while other species can withstand wide temperature and salinity gradients.&lt;ref name="Lalli and Parsons"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lalli, C.M.  |author2=Parsons, T.R. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Biological Oceanography An Introduction|year=1993|publisher=Elsevier|location=30 Corporate Drive, Burlington, MA 01803|isbn=978-0-7506-3384-0|pages=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zooplankton patchiness can also be influenced by biological factors, as well as  other physical factors.  Biological factors include breeding, predation, concentration of phytoplankton, and vertical migration.&lt;ref name="Lalli and Parsons"/&gt; The physical factor that influences zooplankton distribution the most is mixing of the water column ([[upwelling]] and [[downwelling]] along the coast and in the open ocean) that affects nutrient availability and, in turn, phytoplankton production.&lt;ref name="Lalli and Parsons"/&gt;

Through their consumption and processing of phytoplankton and other food sources, zooplankton play a role in aquatic [[food web]]s, as a resource for consumers on higher [[trophic level]]s (including fish), and as a conduit for packaging the organic material in the [[biological pump]].  Since they are typically small, zooplankton can respond rapidly to increases in phytoplankton abundance,{{Clarify|date=March 2011}} for instance, during the [[spring bloom]].

Zooplankton can also act as a [[infectious disease|disease]] [[natural reservoir|reservoir]].  Crustacean zooplankton have been found to house the bacterium ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', which causes [[cholera]], by allowing the cholera vibrios to attach to their chitinous [[exoskeleton]]s.  This [[symbiotic]] relationship enhances the bacterium's ability to survive in an aquatic environment, as the exoskeleton provides the bacterium with carbon and nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;
