[[File:Catalytic triad of TEV protease.png|thumb|360px|The enzyme [[TEV protease]]{{efn|name=TEV}} contains an example of a catalytic triad of residues (red) in its [[active site]]. The triad consists of an [[aspartate]] ([[acid]]), [[histidine]] ([[Base (chemistry)|base]]) and [[serine]] ([[nucleophile]]). The [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] (black) is bound by the [[binding site]] to orient it next to the triad. {{PDB|1lvm}}]]

A '''catalytic triad''' is a set of three coordinated [[amino acid]]s that can be found in the [[active site]] of some [[enzymes]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="buller1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buller|first=AR|author2=Townsend, CA|date=Feb 19, 2013|title=Intrinsic evolutionary constraints on protease structure, enzyme acylation, and the identity of the catalytic triad|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=110|issue=8|pages=E653–61|bibcode=2013PNAS..110E.653B|doi=10.1073/pnas.1221050110|pmc=3581919|pmid=23382230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catalytic triads are most commonly found in [[hydrolase]] and [[transferase]] enzymes (e.g. [[protease]]s, [[amidase]]s, [[esterase]]s, acylases, [[lipase]]s and [[β-lactamase]]s). An [[Acid]]-[[Base (chemistry)|Base]]-[[Nucleophile]] triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for [[covalent catalysis]]. The [[Amino acid|residues]] form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]], forming a [[covalent]] intermediate which is then [[hydrolysed]] to release the [[Product (chemistry)|product]] and regenerate free enzyme. The nucleophile is most commonly a [[serine]] or [[cysteine]] amino acid, but occasionally [[threonine]] or even [[selenocysteine]]. The [[Protein tertiary structure|3D structure]] of the enzyme brings together the triad residues in a precise orientation, even though they may be far apart in the sequence ([[Protein primary structure|primary structure]]).&lt;ref name = "Stryer_Ch9"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Stryer L, Berg JM, Tymoczko JL | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.H.

As well as [[divergent evolution]] of function (and even the triad's nucleophile), catalytic triads show some of the best examples of [[convergent evolution]].

== Function ==
Enzymes that contain a catalytic triad use it for one of two reaction types: either to [[hydrolysis|split]] a substrate ([[hydrolase]]s) or to transfer one portion of a substrate over to a second substrate ([[transferase]]s). Triads are an inter-dependent set of residues in the [[active site]] of an enzyme and act in concert with other residues (e.g. [[binding site]] and [[oxyanion hole]]) to achieve [[nucleophilic catalysis]]. These triad residues act together to make the [[nucleophile]] member highly [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]], generating a covalent intermediate with the substrate that is then resolved to complete catalysis.

===Mechanism===
Catalytic triads perform [[covalent catalysis]] using a residue as a nucleophile. The reactivity of the nucleophilic residue is increased by the [[functional group]]s of the other triad members. The nucleophile is polarised and oriented by the base, which is itself bound and stabilised by the acid.

Catalysis is performed in two stages. First, the activated nucleophile attacks the [[carbonyl]] carbon and forces the carbonyl oxygen to accept an electron, leading to a tetrahedral [[reaction intermediate|intermediate]]. The build-up of negative charge on this intermediate is typically stabilized by an [[oxyanion hole]] within the active site. The intermediate then collapses back to a carbonyl, ejecting the first half of the substrate, but leaving the second half still covalently bound to the enzyme as an [[acyl-enzyme intermediate]]. The ejection of this first [[leaving group]] is often aided by donation of a proton by the base.

The second stage of catalysis is the resolution of the acyl-enzyme intermediate by the attack of a second substrate. If this substrate is water then the result is hydrolysis; if it is an organic molecule then the result is transfer of that molecule onto the first substrate. Attack by this second substrate forms a new tetrahedral intermediate, which resolves by ejecting the enzyme's nucleophile, releasing the second product and regenerating free enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=PhD Thesis|last=Thomas|first=Shafee,|title=Evolvability of a viral protease: experimental evolution of catalysis, robustness and specificity|date=2014|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Cambridge|url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/245207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wide image|Triad mechanism.svg|1000px|General reaction mechanism of catalysed by a catalytic triad (black): [[nucleophilic substitution]] at a [[carbonyl]] substrate (red) by a second substrate (blue). First, the enzyme's nucleophile (X) attacks the carbonyl to form a covalently linked acyl-enzyme intermediate. This intermediate is then attacked by the second substrate's nucleophile (X'). If the second nucleophile is the hydroxyl of water, the result is hydrolysis, otherwise the result is [[Transferase#Reactions|group transfer]] of X'.}}

==Identity of triad members==
[[File:Triad chemical mech.png|thumb|300px|A catalytic triad charge-relay system as commonly found in proteases. The acid residue (commonly [[glutamate]] or [[aspartate]]) aligns and polarises the base (usually [[histidine]]) which activates the nucleophile (often serine or cysteine, occasionally [[threonine]]). The triad reduces the [[pKa|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] of the nucleophilic residue which then attacks the substrate. An [[oxyanion hole]] of positively charged usually backbone [[amide]]s (occasionally side-chains) stabilise charge build-up on the substrate [[transition state]].]]

===Nucleophile===
The side-chain of the nucleophilic residue performs covalent catalysis on the [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]]. The lone pair of electrons present on the oxygen or sulphur attacks the electropositive [[carbonyl]] carbon.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9"/&gt; The 20 [[amino acid#Standard amino acids|naturally occurring biological amino acids]] do not contain any sufficiently nucleophilic functional groups for many difficult [[catalytic reaction]]s. Embedding the nucleophile in a triad increases its reactivity for efficient catalysis. The most commonly used nucleophiles are the [[hydroxyl]] (OH) of serine and the [[thiol]]/thiolate ion (SH/S&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) of cysteine.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; Alternatively, [[threonine protease]]s use the [[secondary alcohol|secondary hydroxyl]] of threonine, however due to [[steric hindrance]] of the side chain's extra [[methyl group]] such proteases use their [[N-terminal|''N''-terminal]] amide as the base, rather than a separate amino acid.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ekici2023"/&gt;

Use of oxygen or sulphur as the nucleophilic atom causes minor differences in catalysis. Compared to [[Nucleophile#Oxygen|oxygen]], [[Nucleophile#sulphur|sulphur]]’s extra [[d orbital]] makes it larger (by 0.4 Å)&lt;ref name="mcgrath92642"&gt;{{cite journal|last = McGrath|first = ME|author2 = Wilke, ME|author3 = Higaki, JN|author4 = Craik, CS|author5 = Fletterick, RJ|title = Crystal structures of two engineered thiol trypsins.|journal = Biochemistry|date = Nov 28, 1989|volume = 28|issue = 24|pages = 9264–70|pmid = 2611228|doi = 10.1021/bi00450a005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and softer, allows it to form longer bonds (d&lt;sub href="thiol"&gt;C-X&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub href="Nucleophile#Oxygen"&gt;X-H&lt;/sub&gt; by 1.3-fold), and gives it a lower p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; (by 5 units).&lt;ref name="polgár3232"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Polgár|first = L|author2 = Asbóth, B|title = The basic difference in catalyses by serine and cysteine proteinases resides in charge stabilization in the transition state.|journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology|date = Aug 7, 1986|volume = 121|issue = 3|pages = 323–6|pmid = 3540454|doi = 10.1016/s0022-5193(86)80111-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serine is therefore more dependent than cysteine on optimal orientation of the acid-base triad members to reduce its p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="polgár3232" /&gt; in order to achieve concerted [[deprotonation]] with catalysis.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; The low p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of cysteine works to its disadvantage in the resolution of the first [[tetrahedral intermediate]] as unproductive reversal of the original nucleophilic attack is the more favourable breakdown product.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; The triad base is therefore preferentially oriented to [[protonate]] the leaving group amide to ensure that it is ejected to leave the enzyme sulphur covalently bound to the substrate N-terminus. Finally, resolution of the acyl-enzyme (to release the substrate C-terminus) requires serine to be re-protonated whereas cysteine can leave as S&lt;sup href="deprotonation"&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Sterically]], the sulphur of cysteine also forms longer bonds and has a bulkier [[van der Waals radius]]&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; and if [[mutated]] to serine can be trapped in unproductive orientations in the active site.&lt;ref name="mcgrath92642" /&gt;

Very rarely, the [[selenium]] atom of the uncommon amino acid [[selenocysteine]] is used as a nucleophile.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The deprotonated Se&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; state is strongly favoured when in a catalytic triad.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Base===
Since no natural amino acids are strongly nucleophilic, the base in a catalytic triad [[Chemical polarity|polarise]]s and [[deprotonate]]s the nucleophile to increase its reactivity.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9"/&gt; Additionally, it [[protonate]]s the first [[Product (chemistry)|product]] to aid leaving group departure.

The base is most commonly histidine since its p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; allows for effective base catalysis, hydrogen bonding to the acid residue, and deprotonation of the nucleophile residue.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodson|first=G|author2=Wlodawer, A|title=Catalytic triads and their relatives.|journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences|date=September 1998|volume=23|issue=9|pages=347–52|pmid=9787641|doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(98)01254-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[β-lactamase]]s such as [[TEM-1]] use a [[lysine]] residue as the base. Because lysine's p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is so high (p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=11), a glutamate and several other residues act as the acid to stabilise its deprotonated state during the catalytic cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Damblon|first=C|author2=Raquet, X |author3=Lian, LY |author4=Lamotte-Brasseur, J |author5=Fonze, E |author6=Charlier, P |author7=Roberts, GC |author8= Frère, JM |title=The catalytic mechanism of beta-lactamases: NMR titration of an active-site lysine residue of the TEM-1 enzyme|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Mar 5, 1996|volume=93|issue=5|pages=1747–52|pmid=8700829|doi=10.1073/pnas.93.5.1747|bibcode=1996PNAS...93.1747D |pmc=39852}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jelsch|first=C|author2=Lenfant, F |author3=Masson, JM |author4= Samama, JP |title=Beta-lactamase TEM1 of E. coli.

===Acid===
The acidic triad member forms a hydrogen bond with the basic residue. This aligns the basic residue by restricting its side-chain rotation, and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9" /&gt; Two amino acids have acidic [[Amino acid#Side chains|side chains]] at physiological pH (aspartate or glutamate) and so are the most commonly used for this triad member.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9"/&gt; [[Cytomegalovirus]] protease{{efn|name=Cytomegalovirus}} uses a pair of histidines, one as the base, as usual, and one as the acid.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; The second histidine is not as effective an acid as the more common aspartate or glutamate, leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In some enzymes, the acid member of the triad is less necessary and some act only as a dyad. For example, [[papain]]{{efn|Papain {{MEROPS|clan=CA|fam=C1}}|name = papain}} uses [[asparagine]] as its third triad member which orients the histidine base but does not act as an acid. Similarly, [[hepatitis A]] virus protease{{efn|Hepatitis A virus protease {{MEROPS|clan=PA|fam=C3}}}} contains an ordered water in the position where an acid residue should be.

==Examples of triads==

On the left are the nucleophile, base and acid triad members. On the right are different substrates with the cleaved bond indicated by a pair of scissors. Two different bonds in [[beta-lactam]]s can be cleaved (1 by [[penicillin acylase]] and 2 by [[beta-lactamase]]).]]

===Ser-His-Asp===
The Serine-Histidine-Aspartate motif is one of the most thoroughly characterised catalytic motifs in biochemistry.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9"/&gt; The triad is exemplified by [[chymotrypsin]],{{efn|name=Chymotrypsin|Chymotrypsin {{MEROPS|clan=PA|fam=S1}}}} a model serine protease from the [[PA clan|PA superfamily]] which uses its triad to hydrolyse protein backbones. The aspartate is hydrogen bonded to the histidine, increasing the p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of its imidazole nitrogen from 7 to around 12. This allows the histidine to act as a powerful general base and to activate the serine nucleophile. It also has an [[oxyanion hole]] consisting of several backbone amides which stabilises charge build-up on intermediates. The histidine base aids the first leaving group by donating a proton, and also activates the hydrolytic water substrate by abstracting a proton as the remaining OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; attacks the acyl-enzyme intermediate.

The same triad has also convergently evolved in [[α/β hydrolase]]s such as some [[lipase]]s and [[esterase]]s, however [[chirality|orientation]] of the triad members is reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Yueru|last2=Yin|first2=Shuhui|last3=Feng|first3=Yitao|last4=Li|first4=Jie|last5=Zhou|first5=Jiahai|last6=Liu|first6=Changdong|last7=Zhu|first7=Guang|last8=Guo|first8=Zhihong|date=2014-05-30|title=Molecular Basis of the General Base Catalysis of an α/β-Hydrolase Catalytic Triad|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/289/22/15867|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|language=en|volume=289|issue=22|pages=15867–15879|doi=10.1074/jbc.m113.535641|issn=0021-9258|pmid=24737327|pmc=4140940}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rauwerdink|first=Alissa|last2=Kazlauskas|first2=Romas J.|date=2015-10-02|title=How the Same Core Catalytic Machinery Catalyzes 17 Different Reactions: the Serine-Histidine-Aspartate Catalytic Triad of α/β-Hydrolase Fold Enzymes|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.5b01539|journal=ACS Catalysis|volume=5|issue=10|pages=6153–6176|doi=10.1021/acscatal.5b01539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, brain [[acetyl hydrolase]] (which has the same fold as a small [[G-protein]]) has also been found to have this triad. The equivalent Ser-His-''Glu ''triad is used in [[acetylcholinesterase]].

===Cys-His-Asp===
The second most studied triad is the Cysteine-Histidine-Aspartate motif.&lt;ref name="buller1"/&gt; Several families of [[cysteine protease]]s use this triad set, for example TEV protease{{efn|name=TEV|TEV protease {{MEROPS|clan=PA|fam=C4}}}} and [[papain]].{{efn|name=papain|Papain {{MEROPS|clan=CA|fam=C1}}}} The triad acts similarly to serine protease triads, with a few notable differences. Due to cysteine's low p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, the importance of the Asp to catalysis varies and several cysteine proteases are effectively Cys-His dyads (e.g. [[hepatitis A|hepatitis A virus]] protease), whilst in others the cysteine is already deprotonated before catalysis begins (e.g. papain).&lt;ref name="beveridge1355"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beveridge|first=AJ|title=A theoretical study of the active sites of papain and S195C rat trypsin: implications for the low reactivity of mutant serine proteinases|journal=Protein Science|date=July 1996|volume=5|issue=7|pages=1355–65|pmid=8819168|pmc=2143470|doi=10.1002/pro.5560050714}}&lt;/ref&gt; This triad is also used by some amidases, such as [[Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase|''N''-glycanase]] to hydrolyse non-peptide C-N bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The PUB Domain Functions as a p97 Binding Module in Human Peptide ''N''-Glycanase|journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry|year = 2006|issn = 0021-9258|pmid = 16807242|pages = 25502–25508|volume = 281|issue = 35|doi = 10.1074/jbc.M601173200|first = Mark D.|last = Allen|first2 = Alexander|last2 = Buchberger|first3 = Mark|last3 = Bycroft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ser-His-His===
The triad of [[cytomegalovirus]] protease{{efn|name=Cytomegalovirus|Cytomegalovirus protease {{MEROPS|clan=SH|fam=S21}}}} uses histidine as both the acid and base triad members. Removing the acid histidine results in only a 10-fold activity loss (compared to &gt;10,000-fold when aspartate is removed from chymotrypsin). This triad has been interpreted as a possible way of generating a less active enzyme to control cleavage rate.&lt;ref name="ekici2023"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ekici|first=OD|author2=Paetzel, M |author3=Dalbey, RE |title=Unconventional serine proteases: variations on the catalytic Ser/His/Asp triad configuration.|journal=Protein Science|date=December 2008|volume=17|issue=12|pages=2023–37|pmid=18824507|doi=10.1110/ps.035436.108|pmc=2590910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ser-Glu-Asp===
An unusual triad is found in seldolisin proteases.{{efn|Seldolisin protease {{MEROPS|clan=SB|fam=53}}}} The low p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of the glutamate carboxylate group means that it only acts as a base in the triad at very low pH. The triad is hypothesised to be an [[adaptation]] to specific environments like [[acidic]] [[hot spring]]s (e.g. [[kumamolysin]]) or cell [[lysosome]] (e.g. [[tripeptidyl peptidase]]).&lt;ref name="ekici2023"/&gt;

===Cys-His-Ser===
The [[Endothelium|endothelial]] protease [[VASH1|vasohibin]]{{efn|Vasohibin protease {{MEROPS|clan=CA}}|name=Vasohibin}} uses a cysteine as the nucleophile, but a serine to coordinate the histidine base.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanchez-Pulido|first=Luis|last2=Ponting|first2=Chris P.|date=2016-05-15|title=Vasohibins: new transglutaminase-like cysteine proteases possessing a non-canonical Cys-His-Ser catalytic triad|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/10/1441/1742608|journal=Bioinformatics|language=en|volume=32|issue=10|pages=1441–1445|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btv761|issn=1367-4803|pmc=4866520}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sato|first=Yasufumi|last2=Sonoda|first2=Hikaru|date=2007-01-01|title=The Vasohibin Family: A Negative Regulatory System of Angiogenesis Genetically Programmed in Endothelial Cells|url=http://atvb.ahajournals.org/content/27/1/37|journal=Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=37–41|doi=10.1161/01.atv.0000252062.48280.61|issn=1079-5642|pmid=17095714}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the serine being a poor acid, it is still effective in orienting the histidine in the catalytic triad.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Some homologues alternatively have a threonine instead of serine at the acid location.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Thr-Nter, Ser-Nter and Cys-Nter===
Threonine proteases, such as the [[proteasome]] protease subunit{{efn|name=Proteasome|Proteasome {{MEROPS|clan=PB|fam=T1}}}} and [[Glutamate N-acetyltransferase|ornithine acyltransferases]]{{efn|name=OAT|Ornithine acyltransferases {{MEROPS|clan=PE|fam=T5}}}} use the secondary hydroxyl of threonine in a manner analogous to the use of the serine [[primary alcohol|primary hydroxyl]].&lt;ref name="brannigan416"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brannigan|first=JA|author2=Dodson, G |author3=Duggleby, HJ |author4=Moody, PC |author5=Smith, JL |author6=Tomchick, DR |author7= Murzin, AG |title=A protein catalytic framework with an ''N''-terminal nucleophile is capable of self-activation|journal=Nature|date=Nov 23, 1995|volume=378|issue=6555|pages=416–9|pmid=7477383|doi=10.1038/378416a0|bibcode=1995Natur.378..416B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cheng1902"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheng|first=H|author2=Grishin, NV|title=DOM-fold: a structure with crossing loops found in DmpA, ornithine acetyltransferase, and molybdenum cofactor-binding domain.|journal=Protein Science|date=July 2005|volume=14|issue=7|pages=1902–10|pmid=15937278|doi=10.1110/ps.051364905|pmc=2253344}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the steric interference of the extra methyl group of threonine, the base member of the triad is the ''N''-terminal amide which polarises an ordered water which, in turn, [[deprotonates]] the catalytic hydroxyl to increase its reactivity.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ekici2023"/&gt; Similarly, there exist equivalent 'serine only' and 'cysteine only' configurations such as [[penicillin acylase]] G{{efn|Penicillin acylase G {{MEROPS|clan=PB|fam=S45}}}} and [[penicillin acylase]] V{{efn|Penicillin acylase V {{MEROPS|clan=PB|fam=C59}}}} which are evolutionarily related to the proteasome proteases. Again, these use their ''N''-terminal amide as a base.&lt;ref name="ekici2023" /&gt;

===Ser-''cis''Ser-Lys===
This unusual triad occurs only in one superfamily of amidases. In this case, the lysine acts to polarise the middle serine.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shin|first=S|author2=Yun, YS |author3=Koo, HM |author4=Kim, YS |author5=Choi, KY |author6= Oh, BH |title=Characterization of a novel Ser-cisSer-Lys catalytic triad in comparison with the classical Ser-His-Asp triad.|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=Jul 4, 2003|volume=278|issue=27|pages=24937–43|pmid=12711609|doi=10.1074/jbc.M302156200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The middle serine then forms two strong hydrogen bonds to the nucleophilic serine to activate it (one with the side chain hydroxyl and the other with the backbone amide). The middle serine is held in an unusual ''[[Cis–trans isomerism|cis]]'' orientation to facilitate precise contacts with the other two triad residues. The triad is further unusual in that the lysine and ''cis''-serine both act as the base in activating the catalytic serine, but the same lysine also performs the role of the acid member as well as making key structural contacts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cerqueira|first=N.

===Sec-His-Glu===
The rare, but naturally occurring amino acid [[selenocysteine]] (Sec), can also be found as the nucleophile in some catalytic triads.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandt|first=Wolfgang|last2=Wessjohann|first2=Ludger A.|date=2005-02-04|title=The Functional Role of Selenocysteine (Sec) in the Catalysis Mechanism of Large Thioredoxin Reductases: Proposition of a Swapping Catalytic Triad Including a Sec-His-Glu State|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cbic.200400276/abstract|journal=ChemBioChem|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=386–394|doi=10.1002/cbic.200400276|issn=1439-7633}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selenocysteine is similar to cysteine, but contains a [[selenium]] atom instead of a sulphur. An example is in the active site of [[thioredoxin reductase]], which uses the selenium for reduction of disulphide in thioredoxin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Engineered triads===
In addition to naturally occurring types of catalytic triads, [[protein engineering]] has been used to create enzyme variants with non-native amino acids, or entirely synthetic amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toscano|first=Miguel D.|last2=Woycechowsky|first2=Kenneth J.|last3=Hilvert|first3=Donald|date=2007-04-27|title=Minimalist Active-Site Redesign: Teaching Old Enzymes New Tricks|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.200604205/abstract|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|language=en|volume=46|issue=18|pages=3212–3236|doi=10.1002/anie.200604205|issn=1521-3773}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catalytic triads have also been inserted into otherwise non-catalytic proteins, or protein mimics.

==Divergent evolution==
The sophistication of the active site network causes residues involved in catalysis (and residues in contact with these) to be highly [[evolutionarily conserved]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Halabi|first = N|author2 = Rivoire, O|author3 = Leibler, S|author4 = Ranganathan, R|title = Protein sectors: evolutionary units of three-dimensional structure.|journal = Cell|date = Aug 21, 2009|volume = 138|issue = 4|pages = 774–86|pmid = 19703402|doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.07.038|pmc=3210731}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are examples of divergent evolution in catalytic triads, both in the reaction catalysed, and the residues used in catalysis. The triad remains the core of the active site, but it is evolutionarily [[adaptation|adapted]] to serve different functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How far divergent evolution goes in proteins|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X98800730|journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology|date = June 1998|pages = 380–387|volume = 8|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/S0959-440X(98)80073-0|first = Alexey G|last = Murzin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Divergent Evolution of Enzymatic Function: Mechanistically Diverse Superfamilies and Functionally Distinct Suprafamilies|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.biochem.70.1.209|journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry|date = 2001|pmid = 11395407|pages = 209–246|volume = 70|issue = 1|doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.70.1.209|first = John A.|last = Gerlt|first2 = Patricia C.|last2 = Babbitt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some proteins, called [[pseudoenzyme]]s, have non-catalytic functions (e.g. regulation by inhibitory binding) and have accumulated mutations that inactivate their catalytic triad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=JM|last2=Farhan|first2=H|last3=Eyers|first3=PA|year=2017|title=Bio-Zombie: the rise of pseudoenzymes in biology|url=|journal=Biochem Soc Trans|volume=45|issue=|pages=537–544|doi=10.1042/bst20160400|pmid=28408493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reaction changes ===
Catalytic triads perform [[covalent catalysis]] via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. If this intermediate is resolved by water, the result is hydrolysis of the substrate. However, if the intermediate is resolved by attack by a second substrate, then the enzyme acts as a [[transferase]]. For example, attack by an [[acyl]] group results in an [[acyltransferase]] reaction. Several families of transferase enzymes have evolved from hydrolases by adaptation to exclude water and favour attack of a second substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sinapoyltransferases in the light of molecular evolution|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031942209002970|journal = Phytochemistry|date = October 2009|pages = 1652–1662|volume = 70|series = Evolution of Metabolic Diversity|issue = 15–16|doi = 10.1016/j.phytochem.2009.07.023|first = Felix|last = Stehle|first2 = Wolfgang|last2 = Brandt|first3 = Milton T.|last3 = Stubbs|first4 = Carsten|last4 = Milkowski|first5 = Dieter|last5 = Strack|pmid=19695650}}&lt;/ref&gt; In different members of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily, the Ser-His-Asp triad is tuned by surrounding residues to perform at least 17 different reactions.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimitriou|first=Polytimi S.|last2=Denesyuk|first2=Alexander|last3=Takahashi|first3=Seiji|last4=Yamashita|first4=Satoshi|last5=Johnson|first5=Mark S.|last6=Nakayama|first6=Toru|last7=Denessiouk|first7=Konstantin|date=2017-10-01|title=Alpha/beta-hydrolases: A unique structural motif coordinates catalytic acid residue in 40 protein fold families|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prot.25338/abstract|journal=Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics|language=en|volume=85|issue=10|pages=1845–1855|doi=10.1002/prot.25338|issn=1097-0134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these reactions are also achieved with mechanisms that have altered formation, or resolution of the acyl-enzyme intermediate, or that don't proceed via an acyl-enzyme intermediate.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Additionally, an alternative transferase mechanism has been evolved by [[amidophosphoribosyltransferase]]s, which has two active sites.{{efn|amidophosphoribosyltransferase {{MEROPS|clan=PB|fam=C44}}}} In the first active site, a cysteine triad hydrolyses a [[glutamine]] substrate to release free ammonia. The ammonia then diffuses though an [[enzyme tunnel|internal tunnel]] in the enzyme to the second active site, where it is transferred to a second substrate.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Smith JL|title = Glutamine PRPP amidotransferase: snapshots of an enzyme in action|journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology|volume = 8|issue = 6|pages = 686–94|date = Dec 1998|pmid = 9914248|doi = 10.1016/s0959-440x(98)80087-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Smith JL, Zaluzec EJ, Wery JP, Niu L, Switzer RL, Zalkin H, Satow Y|title = Structure of the allosteric regulatory enzyme of purine biosynthesis|journal = Science|volume = 264|issue = 5164|pages = 1427–1433|date = Jun 1994|pmid = 8197456|doi = 10.1126/science.8197456|bibcode = 1994Sci...264.1427S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Divergent evolution of active site residues is slow, due to strong chemical constraints. Nevertheless, some protease [[Protein superfamily|superfamilies]] have evolved from one nucleophile to another. This can be inferred when a superfamily (with the same [[protein structure|fold]]) contains [[protein family|families]] that use different nucleophiles.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Such nucleophile switches have occurred several times during evolutionary history, however the mechanisms by which this happen are still unclear.&lt;ref name="pmid19892822"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Within protease superfamilies that contain a mixture of nucleophiles (e.g. the [[PA clan]]), families are designated by their catalytic nucleophile (C=cysteine proteases, S=serine proteases).

The [[enzymology]] of proteases provides some of the clearest known examples of convergent evolution. The same geometric arrangement of triad residues occurs in over 20 separate enzyme [[Superfamily (proteins)|superfamilies]]. Each of these superfamilies is the result of convergent evolution for the same triad arrangement within a different [[Protein tertiary structure|structural fold]]. This is because there are limited productive ways to arrange three triad residues, the enzyme backbone and the substrate. These examples reflect the intrinsic chemical and physical constraints on enzymes, leading evolution to repeatedly and independently converge on equivalent solutions.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buller1"/&gt;

=== Cysteine and serine hydrolases ===
The same triad geometries been converged upon by serine proteases such as the [[chymotrypsin]]{{efn|name=Chymotrypsin}} and [[subtilisin]] superfamilies. Similar convergent evolution has occurred with cysteine proteases such as viral [[C3 protease]] and [[papain]]{{efn|Papain {{MEROPS|clan=CA|fam=C1}}|name = papain}} superfamilies. These triads have converged to almost the same arrangement due to the mechanistic similarities in cysteine and serine proteolysis mechanisms.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt;

=== Threonine proteases ===
Threonine proteases use the amino acid threonine as their catalytic nucleophile. Unlike cysteine and serine, threonine is a secondary hydroxyl (i.e. has a methyl group). This methyl group greatly restricts the possible orientations of triad and substrate as the methyl clashes with either the enzyme backbone or histidine base.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; When the nucleophile of a serine protease was mutated to threonine, the methyl occupied a mixture of positions, most of which prevented substrate binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pelc|first=Leslie A.|last2=Chen|first2=Zhiwei|last3=Gohara|first3=David W.|last4=Vogt|first4=Austin D.|last5=Pozzi|first5=Nicola|last6=Di Cera|first6=Enrico|date=2015-02-24|title=Why Ser and Not Thr Brokers Catalysis in the Trypsin Fold|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.5b00014|journal=Biochemistry|volume=54|issue=7|pages=1457–1464|doi=10.1021/acs.biochem.5b00014|issn=0006-2960|pmc=4342846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the catalytic residue of a threonine protease is located at it ''N''-terminus.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt;

Two evolutionarily independent [[enzyme superfamilies]] with different protein folds are known to use the ''N''-terminal residue as a nucleophile: Superfamily PB (proteasomes using the Ntn fold)&lt;ref name="brannigan416" /&gt; and Superfamily PE ([[acetyltransferase]]s using the DOM fold)&lt;ref name="cheng1902" /&gt; This commonality of [[active site]] structure in completely different protein folds indicates that the active site evolved convergently in those superfamilies.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ekici2023" /&gt;

Since there is no need to maintain cell viability, toxic proteins can be produced.  

==Introduction==

Common components of a cell-free reaction include a cell extract, an energy source, a supply of [[amino acids]], [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] such as [[magnesium]], and the [[DNA]] with the desired [[genes]]. A cell extract is obtained by [[Lysis|lysing]] the cell of interest and [[Centrifuge|centrifuging]] out the cell walls, DNA [[genome]], and other debris. The remains are the necessary cell machinery including [[ribosomes]], [[aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases]], translation initiation and [[elongation factors]], [[nucleases]], etc.

Two types of DNA can be used in CFPS: [[plasmids]] and [[linear expression templates]] (LETs). Plasmids are circular, and only made inside cells. LETs can be made much more effectively via [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] , which replicates DNA much faster than raising cells in an [[Incubator (culture)|incubator]]. While LETs are easier and faster to make, plasmid yields are usually much higher in CFPS. Because of this, much research today is focused on optimizing CFPS LET yields to approach the yields of CFPS with plasmids.

An energy source is an important part of a cell-free reaction. Usually, a separate mixture containing the needed energy source, along with a supply of amino acids, is added to the extract for the reaction. Common sources are [[Phosphoenolpyruvic acid|phosphoenol pyruvate]], [[acetyl phosphate]], and [[creatine phosphate]].

==Advantages and Applications==

CFPS has many advantages over the traditional ''[[in vivo]]'' synthesis of proteins. Most notably, a cell-free reaction, including extract preparation, usually takes 1 –2 days, whereas ''in vivo'' protein expression may take 1–2 weeks.&lt;ref name="ghoshdastider"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ma Y, Ghoshdastider U, Wang J, Ye W, Dötsch V, Filipek S, Bernhard F, Wang X |title=Cell-free expression of human glucosamine 6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase (HsGNA1) for inhibitor screening |journal=Protein Expr. Purif. |volume=86 |issue=2 |pages=120–6 |year=2012 |pmid=23036358 |doi=10.1016/j.pep.2012.09.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22008973"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carlson ED, Gan R, Hodgman CE, Jewett MC |title=Cell-free protein synthesis: applications come of age |journal=Biotechnol. Adv. |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=1185–94 |year=2012 |pmid=22008973 |pmc=4038126 |doi=10.1016/j.biotechadv.2011.09.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CFPS is an open reaction. The lack of cell wall allows direct manipulation of the chemical environment. Samples are easily taken, concentrations optimized, and the reaction can be monitored. In contrast, once DNA is inserted into live cells, the reaction cannot be accessed until it is over and the cells are lysed.

Another advantage to CFPS is the lack of concern for toxicity. Some desired proteins and labeled proteins are toxic to cells when synthesized.&lt;ref name="Jackson2004"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Jackson AM|title=Cell-free protein synthesis for proteomics|journal=Briefings in Functional Genomics and Proteomics|volume=2|issue=4|year=2004|pages=308–319|issn=1473-9550|doi=10.1093/bfgp/2.4.308}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since live cells are not being used, the toxicity of the product protein is not a significant concern.

A major application of CFPS is incorporation of unnatural amino acids into [[protein structure]]s (see [[expanded genetic code]]). The openness of the reaction is ideal for inserting the modified [[tRNAs]] and unnatural amino acids required for such a reaction.

Synthetic biology has many other uses and is a bright future in fields such as [[protein evolution]], [[nanomachines]], [[nucleic acid circuits]], and synthesis of [[virus]]-like particles for [[vaccines]] and [[drug therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.21716 | doi=10.1002/bit.21716| pmid=18023052| title=Escherichia coli-based cell-free synthesis of virus-like particles| journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering| volume=100| issue=1| pages=28–37| year=2008| last1=Bundy| first1=Bradley C.| last2=Franciszkowicz| first2=Marc J.| last3=Swartz| first3=James R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Patriarchi T, Shen A, He W, Baikoghli M, Cheng RH, Xiang YK, Coleman MA, Tian L|title=Nanodelivery of a functional membrane receptor to manipulate cellular phenotype |journal=Sci.

==Limitations==

One challenge associated with CFPS is the degradation of the DNA by [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] nucleases in the cell extract. This is particularly problematic with LETs. Cells have [[endonucleases]] that attack random sites of a DNA strands; however, much more common are the [[exonucleases]] which attack DNA from the ends. Since plasmids are circular and have no end to which the exonucleases may attach, they are not affected by the latter. LETs, however, are susceptible to both. Because of LET vulnerability, much research today is focused on optimizing CFPS LET yields to approach the yields of CFPS using plasmids.

One example of this improved protection with plasmids is use of the [[Lambda phage|bacteriophage lambda]] [[gam protein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P03702|title=gam - Host-nuclease inhibitor protein gam - Escherichia phage lambda - gam gene &amp; protein|website=www.uniprot.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gam is an inhibitor of [[RecBCD]], an exonuclease found in ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (''E. coli'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Kenan C.|title=The λ Gam Protein Inhibits RecBCD Binding to dsDNA Ends|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022283607006171|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|volume=371|issue=1|pages=19–24|doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2007.05.085}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the use of gam, CFPS yields with LETs were greatly increased, and were comparable to CFPS yields with plasmids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sitaraman|first=Kalavathy|last2=Esposito|first2=Dominic|last3=Klarmann|first3=George|last4=Grice|first4=Stuart F Le|last5=Hartley|first5=James L|last6=Chatterjee|first6=Deb K|title=A novel cell-free protein synthesis system|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168165604001142|journal=Journal of Biotechnology|volume=110|issue=3|pages=257–263|doi=10.1016/j.jbiotec.2004.02.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; PURE extracts can also be made, eliminating the concern of exonucleases. These extracts are expensive to make and are not currently an economical solution to the issue of exogenous DNA degradation.

==Types of Cell-free systems==

Common cell extracts in use today are made from ''E. coli'' (ECE), [[rabbit]] [[reticulocytes]] (RRL), [[wheat germ]] (WGE), and [[insect]] cells (ICE).&lt;ref name="pmid22008973"/&gt; All of these extracts are commercially available.

ECE is the most popular lysate for several reasons. It is the most inexpensive extract and the least time intensive to create. Also, large amounts of ''E. coli'' are easily grown, and then easily lysed through use of a [[homogenizer]]. ECE also provides the highest protein yields. However, high yield production can limit the complexity of the synthesized protein, particularly in post-translational modification. In that regard, the lower efficient [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] systems could be advantageous, provided that modifying [[enzyme]] systems have been maintained in the extracts.

Each eukaryotic system has their advantages and disadvantages. For example, WGE extract produces the highest yields of the three eukaryotic extracts; however, it is not as effective for some post-translational modifications such as [[glycosylation]].&lt;ref name="pmid22008973"/&gt; When choosing an extract, the type of post-translational modification, desired yields, and cost should be taken into account.

==History==
The first elucidation of a [[codon]] was done by [[Marshall Nirenberg]] and [[Heinrich J. Matthaei]] in 1961 at the National Institutes of Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=223178 | year=1961 | author1=Nirenberg | first1=M. W. | title=The Dependence of Cell- Free Protein Synthesis in E. Coli Upon Naturally Occurring or Synthetic Polyribonucleotides | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=47 | issue=10 | pages=1588–1602 | last2=Matthaei | first2=J. H. | bibcode=1961PNAS...47.1588N | doi=10.1073/pnas.47.10.1588 | pmid=14479932}}&lt;/ref&gt; They used a cell-free system to translate a poly-[[uracil]] [[RNA]] sequence (or UUUUU... in [[biochemical]] terms) and discovered that the [[polypeptide]] they had synthesized consisted of only the amino acid [[phenylalanine]]. They thereby deduced from this poly-phenylalanine that the codon UUU specified the amino-acid phenylalanine. Extending this work, Nirenberg and his coworkers were able to determine the nucleotide makeup of each codon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5861">'''Cellular stress response''' is the wide range of [[molecular biology|molecular]] changes that [[cell (biology)|cells]] undergo in response to environmental [[stressor]]s, including extremes of temperature, exposure to toxins, and mechanical damage. The various processes involved in cellular stress responses serve the [[adaptation|adaptive]] purpose of protecting a cell against unfavorable environmental conditions, both through short term mechanisms that minimize acute damage to the cell's overall integrity, and through longer term mechanisms which provide the cell a measure of resiliency against similar adverse conditions.&lt;ref name="Scientific American"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Welch|first=William|title=How Cells Respond to Stress|date=May 1993|pages=56–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== General characteristics ==
Cellular stress responses are primarily mediated through what are classified as ''stress proteins''. Stress proteins often are further subdivided into two general categories: those that only are activated by stress, or those that are involved both in stress responses and in normal cellular functioning. The essential character of these stress proteins in promoting the survival of cells has contributed to them being remarkably well [[Conserved sequence|conserved]] across phyla, with nearly identical stress proteins being expressed in the simplest prokaryotic cells as well as the most complex eukaryotic ones.&lt;ref name="Simon Fraser"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cell Stress Response|publisher=[[Simon Fraser University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stress proteins can exhibit widely varied functions within a cell- both during normal life processes and in response to stress. For example, studies in [[Drosophila]] have indicated that when DNA encoding certain stress proteins exhibit mutation defects, the resulting cells have impaired or lost abilities such as normal [[mitosis|mitotic]] division and [[proteasome]]-mediated protein degradation. As expected, such cells were also highly vulnerable to stress, and ceased to be viable at elevated temperature ranges.&lt;ref name="Scientific American"/&gt;

Although stress response pathways are mediated in different ways depending on the stressor involved, cell type, etc., a general characteristic of many pathways{{spaced ndash}} especially ones where heat is the principle stressor{{spaced ndash}} is that they are initiated by the presence and detection of [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] proteins. Because conditions such as high temperatures often cause proteins to denature, this mechanism enables cells to determine when they are subject to high temperature without the need of specialized thermosensitive proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milisav|first=Irina|title=Cellular Stress Responses|journal=Advances in Regenerative Medicine|url=http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/23657/InTech-Cellular_stress_responses.pdf | format = [[PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, if a cell under normal (meaning unstressed) conditions has denatured proteins artificially injected into it, it will trigger a stress response.

== Response to heat ==
{{main|heat shock}}
[[File:Confocal analysis of dermal fibroblasts after heat shock stress (progeria) CROPPED.jpg|370px|thumbnail|right|Cells subjected to heat shock. Cells in slide 'e' exhibit dysmorphic nuclei as a result of this exposure to stress, however 24 hours later cells largely recovered, as shown in slide 'f'.]]
The heat shock response involves a class of stress proteins called [[heat shock proteins]]. These can help defend a cell against damage by acting as 'chaperons' in protein folding so as to ensure proteins assume their necessary shape and do not become denatured and thus useless to the cell.&lt;ref name="Heat Shock"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richter|first=Klaus |author2=Martin Haslbeck |author3=[[Johannes Buchner]]|title=The Heat Shock Response: Life on the Verge of Death|journal=[[Molecular Cell]]|date=22 October 2010|volume=40|issue=2|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276510007823|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2010.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This role is especially crucial since elevated temperature would, on its own, increase the concentrations of malformed proteins. Heat shock proteins can also participate in marking malformed proteins for degradation via [[ubiquitin]] tags.

== Response to toxins ==
Many toxins end up activating similar stress proteins to heat or other stress-induced pathways because it is fairly common for some types of toxins to achieve their effects - at least in part - by denaturing vital cellular proteins. For example, many heavy metals can react with sulfhydryl groups stabilizing proteins, resulting in conformational changes, and other toxins that either directly or indirectly lead to the release of free radicals can generate misfolded proteins.&lt;ref name="Simon Fraser"/&gt;

== Applications ==
Early research has suggested that cells which are better able to synthesize stress proteins and do so at the appropriate time are better able to withstand damage caused by [[ischemia]] and [[ischemic cascade|reperfusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Majmunda|first=Amar|author2=Waihay J. Wong|author3=M. Celeste Simon|title=Hypoxia-Inducible Factors and the Response to Hypoxic Stress|journal=[[Molecular Cell]]|date=22 October 2010|volume=40|issue=2|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276510007501|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2010.09.022|pmid=20965423|pmc=3143508}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many stress proteins overlap with [[immune system|immune]] proteins. These similarities have medical applications in terms of studying the structure and functions of both immune proteins and stress proteins, as well as the role each plays in combating disease.&lt;ref name="Scientific American"/&gt;

==Appearance==

Carcot-Leyden crystals are composed of an eosinophilic lysophospholipase binding protein called Galectin -10. They vary in size and may be as large as 50&amp;nbsp;µm in length. Charcot–Leyden crystals are slender and pointed at both ends, consisting of a pair of hexagonal pyramids joined at their bases. Normally colorless, they are [[staining (biology)|stained]] purplish-red by [[Masson's trichrome|trichrome]].

==Clinical significance==

They are indicative of a disease involving eosinophilic inflammation or proliferation, such as is found in allergic reactions and parasitic infections like Entamoeba histolytica.

Charcot–Leyden crystals are often seen pathologically in patients with bronchial asthma.

==History==

[[Friedrich Albert von Zenker]] was the first to notice these crystals, doing so in 1851, after which they were described jointly by [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] and [[Charles-Philippe Robin]] in 1853,&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Charcot, C. P. Robin: ''Observation de leucocythémie.'' Comptes rendus de la Société de biologie, Paris, 1853, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; then in 1872 by [[Ernst Viktor von Leyden]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Victor von Leyden: ''Zur Kenntnis des Asthma bronchiale.''

'''Chemical engineering''' is a branch of [[engineering]] that uses principles of [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]], and [[economics]] to efficiently use, produce, transform, and transport chemicals, materials, and energy. A chemical engineer designs large-scale processes that convert chemicals, raw materials, living cells, microorganisms, and energy into useful forms and products.

Chemical engineers are involved in many aspects of plant design and operation, including safety and hazard assessments, process design and analysis, [[control engineering]], [[chemical reaction engineering]], construction specification, and operating instructions.

==Etymology==
[[File:Davis GE.jpg|thumb|150px|[[George E. Davis]]]]

A 1996 ''[[British Journal for the History of Science]]'' article cites James F. Donnelly for mentioning an 1839 reference to chemical engineering in relation to the production of [[sulfuric acid]].{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=172}} In the same paper however, [[George E. Davis]], an English consultant, was credited for having coined the term.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=174}} Davis also tried to found a ''Society of Chemical Engineering'', but instead it was named the [[Society of Chemical Industry]] (1881), with Davis as its first Secretary.&lt;ref name="Swindin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swindin|first1=N.|title=George E.

==History==
{{main|History of chemical engineering}} 
Chemical engineering emerged upon the development of [[unit operations]], a fundamental concept of the discipline of chemical engineering. Most authors agree that Davis invented the concept of unit operations if not substantially developed it.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|pp=172–173}} He gave a series of lectures on unit operations at the [[Manchester Technical School]] (later part of the [[University of Manchester]]) in 1887, considered to be one of the earliest such about chemical engineering.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=175}} Three years before Davis' lectures, [[Henry Edward Armstrong]] taught a degree course in chemical engineering at the [[City and Guilds of London Institute]]. Armstrong's course failed simply because its graduates ... were not especially attractive to employers. Employers of the time would have rather hired chemists and [[mechanical engineers]].{{sfn|Reynolds|2001|p=176}} Courses in chemical engineering offered by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in the United States, [[Owens College, Manchester|Owens College]] in [[Manchester]], England, and [[University College London]] suffered under similar circumstances.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=178}}

[[File:MIT Industrial Chemistry Lab.gif|thumb|Students inside an industrial chemistry laboratory at MIT|250px]]

Starting from 1888,{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=180}} [[Lewis M. Norton]] taught at MIT the first chemical engineering course in the United States. Norton's course was contemporaneous and essentially similar to Armstrong's course. Both courses, however, simply merged chemistry and engineering subjects along with product design. "Its practitioners had difficulty convincing engineers that they were engineers and chemists that they were not simply chemists."{{sfn|Reynolds|2001|p=176}} Unit operations was introduced into the course by [[William Hultz Walker]] in 1905.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=183}} By the early 1920s, unit operations became an important aspect of chemical engineering at MIT and other US universities, as well as at [[Imperial College London]].{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=184}} The [[American Institute of Chemical Engineers]] (AIChE), established in 1908, played a key role in making chemical engineering considered an independent science, and unit operations central to chemical engineering. For instance, it defined chemical engineering to be a "science of itself, the basis of which is ... unit operations" in a 1922 report; and with which principle, it had published a list of academic institutions which offered "satisfactory" chemical engineering courses.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=187}} Meanwhile, promoting chemical engineering as a distinct science in Britain lead to the establishment of the [[Institution of Chemical Engineers]] (IChemE) in 1922.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=189}} IChemE likewise helped make unit operations considered essential to the discipline.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=190}}

===New concepts and innovations===
By the 1940s, it became clear that unit operations alone were insufficient in developing [[chemical reactor]]s. While the predominance of unit operations in chemical engineering courses in Britain and the United States continued until the 1960s, [[Transport phenomena (engineering &amp; physics)|transport phenomena]] started to experience greater focus.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=185}} Along with other novel concepts, such as [[process systems engineering]] (PSE), a "second paradigm" was defined.{{sfn|Ogawa|2007|p=2}}{{sfn|Perkins|2003|p=29}} Transport phenomena gave an [[systems analysis|analytical]] approach to chemical engineering{{sfn|Perkins|2003|p=30}} while PSE focused on its synthetic elements, such as [[control system]] and [[Process design (chemical engineering)|process design]].{{sfn|Perkins|2003|p=31}} Developments in chemical engineering before and after [[World War II]] were mainly incited by the [[petrochemical industry]],{{sfn|Reynolds|2001|p=177}} however, advances in other fields were made as well. Advancements in [[biochemical engineering]] in the 1940s, for example, found application in the [[pharmaceutical industry]], and allowed for the [[mass production]] of various [[antibiotic]]s, including [[penicillin]] and [[streptomycin]].{{sfn|Perkins|2003|pp=32–33}} Meanwhile, progress in [[polymer science]] in the 1950s paved way for the "age of plastics".{{sfn|Kim|2002|p=7S}}

===Safety and hazard developments===
Concerns regarding the safety and environmental impact of large-scale chemical manufacturing facilities were also raised during this period. ''[[Silent Spring]]'', published in 1962, alerted its readers to the harmful effects of [[DDT]], a potent [[insecticide]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} The 1974 [[Flixborough disaster]] in the United Kingdom resulted in 28 deaths, as well as damage to a [[chemical plant]] and three nearby villages.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} The 1984 [[Bhopal disaster]] in India resulted in almost 4,000 deaths.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} These incidents, along with [[List of industrial disasters|other incidents]], affected the reputation of the trade as [[industrial safety]] and [[environmental protection]] were given more focus.{{sfn|Kim|2002|p=8S}} In response, the IChemE required safety to be part of every degree course that it accredited after 1982. By the 1970s, legislation and monitoring agencies were instituted in various countries, such as France, Germany, and the United States.{{sfn|Perkins|2003|p=35}}

===Recent progress===
Advancements in [[computer science]] found applications designing and managing plants, simplifying calculations and drawings that previously had to be done manually. The completion of the [[Human Genome Project]] is also seen as a major development, not only advancing chemical engineering but [[genetic engineering]] and [[genomics]] as well.{{sfn|Kim|2002|p=9S}} Chemical engineering principles were used to produce [[DNA sequences]] in large quantities.{{sfn|American Institute of Chemical Engineers|2003a}}

==Concepts==
{{chemical engineering}}

Chemical engineering involves the application of several principles. Key concepts are presented below.

===Plant design and construction===
Chemical engineering design concerns the creation of plans, specification, and economic analyses for [[pilot plant]]s, new plants or plant modifications. Design engineers often work in a consulting role, designing plants to meet clients' needs. Design is limited by a number of factors, including funding, government regulations and safety standards. These constraints dictate a plant's choice of process, materials and equipment.{{sfn|Towler|Sinnott|2008|pp=2–3}}

Plant construction is coordinated by [[project engineering|project engineers]] and project managers &lt;ref&gt;Herbst, Andrew; Hans Verwijs (Oct. 19-22). "Project Engineering: Interdisciplinary Coordination and Overall Engineering Quality Control". Proc. of the Annual IAC conference of the American Society for Engineering Management 1 ({{ISBN|9781618393616}}): 15–21&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the size of the investment. A chemical engineer may do the job of project engineer full-time or part of the time, which requires additional training and job skills or act as a consultant to the project group. In the USA the education of chemical engineering graduates from the Baccalaureate programs accredited by [[ABET]] do not usually stress project engineering education, which can be obtained by specialized training, as electives, or from [[graduate programs]].  Project engineering jobs are some of the largest employers for chemical engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Do Chemical Engineers Do?|url=http://chemistry.about.com/od/chemistrystudentfaqs/f/chemeng.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process design and analysis===
{{main|Process design}}

A unit operation is a physical step in an individual chemical engineering process. Unit operations (such as [[crystallization]], [[filtration]], [[drying]] and [[evaporation]]) are used to prepare reactants, purifying and separating its products, recycling unspent reactants, and controlling energy transfer in reactors.{{sfn|McCabe|Smith|Hariott|1993|p=4}} On the other hand, a unit process is the chemical equivalent of a unit operation. Along with unit operations, unit processes constitute a process operation. Unit processes (such as [[nitration]] and [[oxidation]]) involve the conversion of material by [[biochemical]], [[thermochemical]] and other means. Chemical engineers responsible for these are called process engineers.{{sfn|Silla|2003|pp=8–9}}

Process design requires the definition of equipment types and sizes as well as how they are connected together and the materials of construction. Details are often printed on a [[Process Flow Diagram]] which is used to control the capacity and reliability of a new or modified chemical factory.

[[Education for Chemical Engineers|Education for chemical engineers]] in the first college degree 3 or 4 years of study stresses the principles and practices of process design. The same skills are used in existing chemical plants to evaluate the [[Economics#Economic efficiency|efficiency]] and make recommendations for improvements.

===Transport phenomena===
{{main|Transport phenomena}}

Modeling and analysis of transport phenomena is essential for many industrial applications. Transport phenomena involve [[fluid dynamics]], [[heat transfer]] and [[mass transfer]], which are governed mainly by [[momentum transfer]], [[energy transfer]] and transport of [[chemical species]] respectively. Models often involve separate considerations for  [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]], [[microscopic scale|microscopic]] and [[molecular]] level phenomena. Modeling of transport phenomena therefore requires an understanding of applied mathematics.{{sfn|Bird|Stewart|Lightfoot|2002|pp=1–2}}

==Applications and practice==
[[File:Chemengg.jpg|thumb|left|Chemical engineers use computers to control automated systems in plants.{{sfn|Garner|2003|pp=47–48}}|alt=Two computer flat screens showing a plant process management application]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1986-0205-015, Chemiekombinat Bitterfeld, Produktion von Weißtönern.jpg|right|thumb|Operators in a chemical plant using an older analog control board, seen in East-Germany, 1986.]]

[[Chemical engineer]]s "develop economic ways of using materials and energy".{{sfn|American Institute of Chemical Engineers|2003|loc=Article III}} Chemical engineers use [[chemistry]] and engineering to turn raw materials into usable products, such as medicine, petrochemicals and plastics on a large-scale, industrial setting. They are also involved in [[waste management]] and research. Both applied and research facets could make extensive use of computers.{{sfn|Garner|2003|pp=47–48}}

Chemical engineers may be involved in industry or university research where they are tasked with designing and performing experiments to create better and safer methods for production, pollution control, and resource conservation. They may be involved in designing and constructing plants as a [[project engineer]]. Chemical engineers serving as project engineers use their knowledge in selecting optimal production methods and plant equipment to minimize costs and maximize safety and profitability. After plant construction, chemical engineering project managers may be involved in equipment upgrades, process changes, troubleshooting, and daily operations in either full-time or consulting roles. {{sfn|Garner|2003|pp=49–50}}

The Co-Managed IT security service model entails security monitoring, event correlation, incident response, system tuning, and compliance support across an organization’s entire IT environment. Co-Management allows organizations to collaborate with their service providers by blending security expertise of the provider with the contextual knowledge of the customer to optimize security posture.

Co-Managed security services also allow for organizations’ critical data and tools to be remotely managed by a team of certified engineers and security analysts from a 24/7/365 [[Information_security_operations_center|Security Operations Center (SOC)]]. This service approach allows for customer data to remain in-house while the [[Security_information_and_event_management|SIEM]] platform is either on-site or cloud-hosted. The service provider’s staff works in conjunction with customer security teams to outline the rules of engagement inside the environment to provide monitoring and respond to alerts in real-time. The Security Operation Center also provide the “care and feeding”, and development of a variety of security solutions. The co-managed approach also allows organizations to focus on emerging internal projects and other critical areas of IT.

According to Gartner’s [https://www.gartner.com/doc/3112220/use-comanaged-siem How and When to Use Co-managed Security Information and Event Management report], “Co-managed SIEM services enable security and risk management leaders to maximize value from SIEM and enhance security monitoring capabilities, while retaining control and flexibility.” and "Co-management is on the rise and expected to grow five-fold by 2020."

''SIEM,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/security-information-and-event-management-siem&lt;/ref&gt; IDS/IPS, Compliance Automation, Network Configuration Management Tools, Advanced Threat Intelligence, Network Access Control, Endpoint Threat Detection and Response, Application Security, File Integrity Monitoring, Forensic Investigation, and Vulnerability Scanning and Assessment'', are all examples of cyber security solutions that co-managed service providers support&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eventtracker.com/campaigns/co-managed-siem/&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4329">'''Conjugate eye movement''' refers to motor coordination of the eyes that allows for bilateral fixation on a single object.  
A conjugate eye movement is a movement of both eyes in the same direction to maintain binocular gaze (also referred to as “yoked” eye movement). This is in contrast to [[vergence]] eye movement, where binocular gaze is maintained by moving eyes in opposite directions, such as going “cross eyed” to view an object moving towards the face. Conjugate eye movements can be in any direction, and can accompany both [[saccade|saccadic]] eye movements and [[smooth pursuit]] eye movements.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, D. (n.d.). The Classification of Eye Movements. Retrieved from [http://www.opt.indiana.edu/v665/CD/CD_Version/CH2/CH2.HTM]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conjugate eye movements are used to change the direction of gaze without changing the depth of gaze. This can be used to either follow a moving object, or change focus entirely. When following a moving object, conjugate eye movements allow individuals to stabilize their perception of the moving object, and focus on the object rather than the rest of the visual world. When changing focus, conjugate eye movements allow for the perception of a stabilized world relative to an individual, rather than the perception of the world “jumping” as the individual’s gaze shifts.  Without conjugate eye movements, there would be no synchronicity of the information obtained by each eye, so an individual would not be able to willingly move their eyes around a scene while still maintaining depth perception and scene or object stability.&lt;ref&gt;Enderle, J. D. (2010). Models of horizontal eye movements: Part I: Early models of
Saccades and smooth pursuit. S.l.: Morgan &amp; Claypool.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several centers in the brainstem are involved. Horizontal conjugate gaze is controlled by the nuclei of the [[Ocular nerve|Ocular Nerve]], CN III, and the [[Abducens nerve]], CN VI, the [[paramedian pontine reticular formation]], and the [[nucleus prepositus hypoglossi]]-medial [[Vestibular nuclei|vestibular nucleus]]. Vertical conjugate gaze is controlled by the nuclei of CN III and the [[Trochlear nerve]], CN IV, the [[rostral interstitial nucleus of medial longitudinal fasciculus]] (riMLF), and the [[interstitial nucleus of Cajal]].&lt;ref&gt;Fine structure of the interstitial nucleus of Cajal of the cat. J Anat. 1995 August; 187(Pt 1): 141–150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opt.indiana.edu/v665/CD/CD_Version/CH2/CH2.HTM|title=Oculomotor Functions &amp; Neurology CD-ROM|last=Hodgson|first=Douglas|date=|year=2004|website=www.opt.indiana.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disorders of conjugate gaze typically consist of the inability to move one or both eyes in the desired direction, or the inability to prevent eyes from making vergence movements.

[[Conjugate gaze palsy]]: Conjugate gaze palsies typically affect horizontal gaze, although some affect upward gaze. Few affect downward gaze. These effects can range in severity from a complete lack of voluntary eye movement to mild impairments in speed, accuracy or range of eye movement.&lt;ref&gt;Ruben, M. (2017, November). Conjugate Gaze Palsies - Neurologic Disorders. Retrieved from
[https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/neurologic-disorders/neuro-ophthalmologic-and-cranial-nerve-disorders/conjugate-gaze-palsies]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Internuclear ophthalmoplegia]]: Internuclear ophthalmoplegia affects horizontal gaze, such that one eye is capable of full horizontal movement, while the other is incapable of gazing in the direction contralateral to the affected eye.&lt;ref&gt;Toral, M., Haugsdal, J., &amp; Wall, M. (2017, June 08). Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia. Retrieved from [https://webeye.ophth.uiowa.edu/eyeforum/cases/252-internuclear-ophthalmoplega.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[One and a half syndrome]]: “One and a half syndrome” also affects horizontal gaze. One eye is completely incapable of horizontal movement, while the other eye is capable of horizontal movement only in one direction away from the midline.&lt;ref&gt;Xue, F., Zhang, L., Zhang, L., Ying, Z., Sha, O., &amp; Ding, Y. (2017). One-and-a-half syndrome with its spectrum disorders. Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery, 7(6), 691-697. doi:10.21037/qims.2017.12.04&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rights}}
The '''cultural rights''' movement has provoked attention to protect the rights of groups of people, or their [[culture]], in similar fashion to the manner in which the [[human rights]] movement has brought attention to the needs of individuals throughout the world.

==Protecting a culture==
Cultural Rights are rights related to art and culture, both understood in a large sense. The objective of these rights is to guarantee that people and communities have an access to culture and can participate in the culture of their selection. Cultural rights are human rights that aim at assuring the enjoyment of culture and its components in conditions of equality, human dignity and non-discrimination. They are rights related to themes such as [[linguistic rights|language]]; cultural and artistic production; participation in cultural life; cultural heritage; intellectual property rights; [[cultural diversity|author’s rights]]; [[minority group|minorities]] and access to culture, among others. Focusing less on the preservation of cultures as an end in itself and more on the realization of "ecological" relations between cultural groups as a condition for equitable interactions and the potential for organic cultural change, Meyjes proposes the interchangeable terms cultural justice &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyjes|1999|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyjes|2012|p=407}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ethno-cultural justice&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyjes|2012|pp=12, 381ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[intercultural justice]] — which he defines as the principle of maximally accommodating the culturally-specific values and practices of minority groups and their members, in the form of rights, within the overall legal, regulatory, or policy limits of the institution, community, or society concerned (also see [[universalization]]).

==Ethnic Groups Cultural preservation==
Cultural rights of groups focus on such things as religious and ethnic minorities and indigenous societies that are in danger of disappearing. Cultural rights include a group’s ability to preserve its way of life, such as child rearing, continuation of [[language]], and security of its economic base in the nation, which it is located. The related notion of indigenous '''''intellectual property rights''''' (IPR) has arisen in attempt to conserve each society’s culture base and essentially prevent [[ethnocide]].

The cultural rights movement has been popularized because much traditional cultural knowledge has commercial value, like ethno-medicine, cosmetics, cultivated plants, foods, [[folklore]], arts, crafts, songs, dances, costumes, and [[rituals]]. Studying ancient cultures may reveal evidence about the history of the human race and shed more light on our origin and successive cultural development. However, the study, sharing and commercialization of such cultural aspects can be hard to achieve without infringing upon the cultural rights of those who are a part of that culture.

Cultural rights should be taken into consideration also by local policies. In that sense, the [[Agenda 21 for culture]], the first document with worldwide mission that advocates establishing the groundwork of an undertaking by cities and local governments for cultural development, includes as cultural rights as one of the principles and states: “''Local governments recognize that cultural rights are an integral part of human rights, taking as their reference the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1948)''”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agenda21culture.net Agenda 21 for culture]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural anthropology==
"Cultural rights are vested not in individuals but in groups, such as religious and ethnic [[minority group|minorities]] and [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] societies." All cultures are brought up differently, therefore cultural rights include a group's ability to preserve its culture, to raise its children in the ways it forebears, to continue its language, and to not be deprived of its economic base by the nation in which it is located." Anthropologists sometimes choose not to study some cultures beliefs and rights, because they believe that it may cause misbehavior, and they choose not to turn against different diversities of cultures. Although anthropologists sometimes do turn away from studying different cultures they still depend a lot on what they study at different archaeological sites.

[[File:EPIC Systems Demonstration Plant.jpg|thumb|right|Demonstration Plant]]

A '''demonstration plant''' is an industrial system used to validate an industrial process for commercialization. It is larger than a [[pilot plant]], and is the final stage in research, development and demonstration of a new process. Demonstration plants are built in a range of sizes, and the term 'demonstration plant' can sometimes be used interchangeably with 'pilot plant.' However, demonstration plants are generally larger than pilot plants are often constructed following a successful trial in a pilot scale size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gertenbach|first1=Dennis|last2=Cooper|first2=Brian|title=SCALEUP ISSUES FROM BENCH TO PILOT|url=http://www.hazenresearch.com/sites/default/files/case-study/scaleup_issues_from_bench_to_pilot.pdf|website=Hazen Research|publisher=AIChE|accessdate=28 March 2016|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstration plants are used to prove a process works at industrial scale, and is financially viable in its intended industry.

==Goals==
The goals of a demonstration plant are generally as follows:
* Prove a new technology using commercially available, pre-tested equipment.
* Show a reasonable [[return on investment]] ROI for the capital that will be invested in a full-scale system, including the operational costs of running such a system.
* In some case, to start bringing product to market in significant enough amounts that production, distribution and target market viability can be established, including finalization of market testing.
* Establish a viable product method that will endure the test of a true manufacturing operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alpert|first1=S.B.|title=DEMONSTRATION PLANTS: ARE THEY NEEDED?|url=https://web.anl.gov/PCS/acsfuel/preprint%20archive/Files/36_1_ATLANTA_04-91_0362.pdf|website=Argonne National Laboratory|publisher=Electric Power Research Institute|accessdate=28 March 2016|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design factors==
Many of the same design techniques that are used for pilot plants are also used when developing demonstration plants. 3D Modeling, chemical similitude studies, mass and energy balances, risk factors, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and mathematical modeling are common techniques used to design demonstration modules before actual fabrication occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schott|first1=John|title=DEMONSTRATION PLANTS|url=https://www.epicmodularprocess.com/systems/pilot-plant/demonstration-plant |website=EPIC Modular Process|publisher=EPIC Systems, Inc.|accessdate=31 May 2016|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emphasis in a demonstration plant is on using industrial equipment, rather than smaller-scale equipment, to prove process viability. A significant amount of product must be produced in equipment that will hold up over a long production lifetime and not be prohibitively expensive. A demonstration plant must show that enough end-product can be created to offset the costs of the commercial system over a period of time.

This demonstrates the crustal spatial evolution at the Earth's surface dictated by plate tectonics. |248x248px]]
'''Crustal evolution''' involves the formation, destruction and renewal of the rocky outer shell at the [[Earth]]'s surface.

The variation in composition within the Earth's crust is much greater than other [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial planets]]. [[Mars]], [[Venus]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and other planetary bodies have relatively quasi-uniform crusts unlike that of the Earth which contains both oceanic and continental plates.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Albarède|first=Francis|last2=Blichert-Toft|first2=Janne|date=2007-12-19|title=The split fate of the early Earth, Mars, Venus, and Moon|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228642761|journal=Geochemistry (Cosmochemistry)|volume=339|issue=14–15|pages=917–927|doi=10.1016/j.crte.2007.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unique property reflects the complex series of crustal processes that have taken place throughout the planet's history, including the ongoing process of [[plate tectonics]].

The proposed mechanisms, regarding Earth's crustal evolution, take a theory-orientated approach. Fragmentary geologic evidence and observations provide the basis for hypothetical solutions to problems relating to the early Earth system. Therefore a combination of these theories creates both a framework of current understanding and also a platform for future study.

== Early crust ==

=== Mechanisms of early crust formation ===
The early Earth was entirely molten. This was due to high temperatures created and maintained by the following processes:

* Compression of the early atmosphere
* Rapid axial rotation
* Regular impacts with neighbouring planetesimals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EIrwxgpc9GsC|title=Historical Geology: Understanding Our Planet's Past|last=Erickson|first=Jon|date=2014-05-14|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438109640|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] remained hotter than modern day temperatures throughout the [[Archean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-07-01|title=A great thermal divergence in the mantle beginning 2.5 Ga: Geochemical constraints from greenstone basalts and komatiites|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674987116000311|journal=Geoscience Frontiers|language=en|volume=7|issue=4|pages=543–553|doi=10.1016/j.gsf.2016.01.006|issn=1674-9871|last1=Condie|first1=Kent C.|last2=Aster|first2=Richard C.|last3=Van Hunen|first3=Jeroen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time the Earth began to cool as [[planetary accretion]] slowed and heat stored within the [[magma ocean]] was lost to space through [[radiation]].

A theory for the initiation of magma solidification states that once cool enough, the cooler base of the magma ocean would begin to crystallise first. This is because pressure of 25GPa at the surface cause the [[Solidus (chemistry)|solidus]] to lower.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2004-09-15|title=Early Earth differentiation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X04004285|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|language=en|volume=225|issue=3–4|pages=253–269|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2004.07.008|issn=0012-821X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of a thin 'chill-crust' at the extreme surface would provide thermal insulation to the shallow sub surface, keeping it warm enough to maintain the mechanism of crystallisation from the deep magma ocean.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;[[File:Phasediagram.png|thumb|310x310px|A phase diagram showing the order of crystallisation within the early mantle to form the early crust. 

An [[Adiabatic process|adiabat]] represents a change of temperature with pressure if no heat was lost through convection.

The early mantle adiabats show crystallisation took place from from the base; above approximately 25GPa (deep mantle) perovskites would begin to crystallise, below 25GPa (upper mantle) olivine would crystallise.]]

The composition of the crystals produced during the crystallisation of the magma ocean varied with depth. Experiments involving the melting of [[peridotite]] magma show that deep in the ocean (&gt;≈700m), the main mineral present would be Mg-[[perovskite]]. Whereas [[olivine]] would dominate in the shallower areas along with its high pressure [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s e.g. [[garnet]] and [[majorite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2004-06-15|title=Melting experiments of mantle materials under lower mantle conditions with implications for magma ocean differentiation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031920104000718|journal=Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors|language=en|volume=143-144|pages=397–406|doi=10.1016/j.pepi.2003.09.016|issn=0031-9201|last1=Ito|first1=E.|last2=Kubo|first2=A.|last3=Katsura|first3=T.|last4=Walter|first4=M.J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contributing theory to the formation of the first continental crust is through intrusive [[pluton]]ic volcanism. The product of these eruptions formed a hot, thick lithosphere which underwent regular cycling with the mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-12-01|title=Generation of felsic crust in the Archean: A geodynamic modeling perspective|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030192681500337X|journal=Precambrian Research|language=en|volume=271|pages=198–224|doi=10.1016/j.precamres.2015.10.005|issn=0301-9268|last1=Sizova|first1=E.|last2=Gerya|first2=T.|last3=Stüwe|first3=K.|last4=Brown|first4=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heat released by this form of volcanism, as well as assisting [[mantle convection]], increased the geothermal gradient of the early crust.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-10-01|title=Early Earth plume-lid tectonics: A high-resolution 3D numerical modelling approach|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264370716300503|journal=Journal of Geodynamics|language=en|volume=100|pages=198–214|doi=10.1016/j.jog.2016.03.004|issn=0264-3707|last1=Fischer|first1=R.|last2=Gerya|first2=T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crustal dichotomy ==
Crustal dichotomy represents the distinct contrast in composition and nature of the oceanic and continental plates, which together form the overall crust.

=== Timing ===
Oceanic and continental crusts are, at the present day, produced and maintained through plate tectonic processes. However the same mechanisms are unlikely to have produced the crustal [[dichotomy]] of the early lithosphere. This is thought to be true on the basis that sections of the thin, low density continental lithosphere could not have been sub-ducted under each other.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Subsequently, a proposed relative timing for crustal dichotomy is put forward stating that dichotomy took place before the commencement of global plate tectonics. This is so a difference in crustal density could be established to facilitate plate subduction.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1980-02-01|title=Crustal evolution of the early earth: The role of major impacts|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0301926880900121|journal=Precambrian Research|language=en|volume=10|issue=3–4|pages=195–216|doi=10.1016/0301-9268(80)90012-1|issn=0301-9268|last1=Frey|first1=Herbert|hdl=2060/19790015389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formation ===
[[File:Complex Impact Crater Formation.png|thumb|Development of a the base of an impact crater on the Earth's surface showing infill of basaltic partial melts from mantle. This solidified to form the early differentiated oceanic crust.|317x317px]]
==== Impact cratering ====
Large and numerous impact craters can be recognised on planetary bodies across the Solar System. These craters are thought to date back to a period where there was an increased frequency and intensity of asteroid impacts with terrestrial planets, known as the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]], which terminated approximately 4Ga.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/collections/pjfmznbgbx|title=Bombardment of the early Solar System : Nature Geoscience|website=www.nature.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal goes on, claiming the Earth would have also sustained the same relative intensity of cratering as other planetesimals in the [[Solar System]]. It is therefore only due to Earth's high erosional rates and constant plate tectonics that the craters are not visible today. By scaling up the number and size of impact craters seen on the Moon to fit the size of Earth, it is predicted that at least 50% of the Earth's initial crust was covered in impact basins.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This estimate provides a lower limit of the effect impact cratering had on the Earth's surface. 

======&lt;small&gt;Effects&lt;/small&gt;======
The main effects of impact cratering on the early lithosphere were:

* Formation of large craters. [[Isostasy|Isostatic rebound]] would adjust the depth of the craters making them relatively shallow in comparison to their diameter;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1977-10-01|title=Origin of the Earth's ocean basins|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103577900641|journal=Icarus|language=en|volume=32|issue=2|pages=235–250|doi=10.1016/0019-1035(77)90064-1|issn=0019-1035|last1=Frey|first1=Herbert}}&lt;/ref&gt; some reaching 4&amp;nbsp;km deep and 1000&amp;nbsp;km in diameter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
*[[Topography|Topographic]] division between the low-lying impact basins and the now elevated surface.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
* Release in pressure at the surface from the removal of [[overburden]]. This produced a greater increase in temperature with depth below the surface. Increased surface temperatures caused the [[partial melting]] of mantle which erupted and deposited within the surface basins. The [[pyrolite]] mantle would have produced [[basalt]]ic partial melts, compositionally contrasting to the existing [[sial]]ic crust.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The magnitude of these impacts is interpreted, with a high level of uncertainty, to have converted roughly half of the 'continental' crust into terrestrial [[Lunar mare|maria]].&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Stuart Ross|date=1989-04-20|title=Growth of planetary crusts|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040195189901510|journal=Tectonophysics|language=en|volume=161|issue=3–4|pages=147–156|doi=10.1016/0040-1951(89)90151-0|issn=0040-1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore providing a method for the formation of crustal dichotomy, as seen today.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Types of crust ==

==== Primordial crust ====
The initial crystallisation of minerals from the [[magma ocean]] formed the primordial crust. 

A potential explanation of this process states the resultant solidification of the mantle edge took place approximately 4.43Ga. This would subsequently produce continents composed of [[komatiite]], an ultramafic rock rich in [[magnesium]] with a high melting point and low [[dynamic viscosity]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nna-Mvondo|first=Delphine|last2=Martinez-Frias|first2=Jesus|date=2007-02-15|title=Review komatiites: from Earth's geological settings to planetary and astrobiological contexts|journal=Earth, Moon, and Planets|language=en|volume=100|issue=3–4|pages=157–179|doi=10.1007/s11038-007-9135-9|issn=0167-9295|hdl=10261/8082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another line of research follows up on this, proposing that differences in the densities of newly formed crystals caused separation of crustal rocks; upper crust largely composed of fractionated [[gabbro]]s and lower crust composed of [[anorthosite]]s.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Santosh|first1=M.|last2=Arai|first2=T.|last3=Maruyama|first3=S.|date=2017-03-01|title=Hadean Earth and primordial continents: The cradle of prebiotic life|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674987116300834|journal=Geoscience Frontiers|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=309–327|doi=10.1016/j.gsf.2016.07.005|issn=1674-9871}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall result of initial crystallisation formed a primordial crust roughly 60&amp;nbsp;km in depth.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The lack of certainty regarding the formation of primordial crust is due to there being no remaining present day examples. This is due to Earth's high erosional rates and the [[subduction]] and subsequent destruction of tectonic plates throughout its 4.5 Ga history.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Furthermore, during its existence the primordial crust is thought to have been regularly broken and re-formed by impacts involving other planetesimals.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This continued for several hundred million years after [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]], which concluded approximately 4.4Ga.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The outcome of this would be the constant alteration in the composition of the primordial crust, increasing the difficulty in determining its nature.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 

==== Secondary crust ====
Recycling of existing primordial crust contributes to the production of secondary crust. Partial melting of the existing crust increases the [[mafic]] content of the melt producing basaltic secondary crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=L8OM3NDrttsC&amp;pg=PA484&amp;lpg=PA484&amp;dq=secondary+crust#v=onepage&amp;q=secondary%20crust&amp;f=false|title=Earth as an Evolving Planetary System|last=Condie|first=Kent C.|date=2011-08-25|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780123852274|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further method of formation due to the decay of [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] elements within the Earth releasing heat energy and eventually causing the partial melting of upper mantle, also producing basaltic lavas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RtC-nQEACAAJ|title=The Continental Crust: Its Composition and Evolution|last=Taylor|first=Stuart Ross|date=1985|publisher=Blackwell Scientific Publications|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, most secondary crust on Earth is formed at [[Mid-ocean ridge|mid ocean ridges]] forming the oceanic crust.

==== Tertiary crust ====
The present day continental crust is an example of a tertiary crust. Tertiary crust is the most differentiated type of crust and so has a composition vastly different to that of the bulk Earth.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=S. R.|last2=McLennan|first2=S. M.|date=1985-01-01|title=The continental crust: Its composition and evolution|language=English|osti=6582885}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tertiary crust contains over 20% of the abundance of [[incompatible element]]s, which are elements a size or charge that prevent them from being included in mineral structure.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This a result of its generation from the subduction and partial melting of secondary crust where it undergoes further [[Fractional crystallization (geology)|fractional crystallisation]]. Two stages of evolution produce an increased proportion of incompatible elements.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Initiation of plate tectonics ==
[[File:Plumeinducedsubduction.png|thumb|357x357px|A schematic evolutionary diagram showing the impact of a mantle plume on the early lithosphere (dark blue) and surface proto-crust (brown). This initiated subduction and subsequent global plate tectonics within a previously unseparated lithosphere that had no lateral surface movement.Modified from &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2008-12-01|title=Subduction initiation by thermal–chemical plumes: Numerical studies|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031920108001581|journal=Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors|language=en|volume=171|issue=1-4|pages=296–312|doi=10.1016/j.pepi.2008.06.032|issn=0031-9201}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Plume induced subduction ===
The formation and development of [[Mantle plume|plumes]] in the early mantle contributed to triggering the lateral movement of crust across the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kröner|first=A.|last2=Layer|first2=P.

The scale of this impact is much less than that exhibited in the Archean eon where mantle temperatures were much greater. Localised areas of hot mantle rose to the surface through a central plume wedge, weakening the damaged and already thin lithosphere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Once the plume head breaks the surface, crust either side of the head is forced downwards through the conservation of mass, initiating subduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-01-01|title=Late Cretaceous plume-induced subduction initiation along the southern margin of the Caribbean and NW South America: The first documented example with implications for the onset of plate tectonics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1342937X14002391|journal=Gondwana Research|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=38–63|doi=10.1016/j.gr.2014.07.011|issn=1342-937X|last1=Whattam|first1=Scott A.|last2=Stern|first2=Robert J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerical modelling shows only strongly energetic plumes are capable of weakening the lithosphere enough to rupture it, such plumes would have been present in the hot Archean mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerya|first=T.

Pre-tectonic subduction can also be inferred from the internal volcanism on Venus. [[Artemis Corona]] is a large plume formed by the upwelling of mantle derived magma and is on a scale potentially comparable to that in the [[Archean]] mantle.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Models using its known characteristics showed that continued magmatism from [[Thermal conduction|conductive]] heat through the plume caused gravitational collapse. The weight of collapse caused the spreading of the surrounding crust outwards and subsequent subduction around the margins.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Kranendonk|first=Martin J|date=2010|title=Two types of Archean continental crust: Plume and plate tectonics on early Earth|url=http://www.ajsonline.org/content/310/10/1187.full.pdf+html|journal=American Journal of Science|volume=310|pages=1187–1209|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[anhydrous]] nature of the crust on Venus prevents it from sliding past each other, whereas through the study of oxygen isotopes, the presence of water on Earth can be confirmed from 4.3Ga.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005-07-15|title=Magmatic δ18O in 4400–3900 Ma detrital zircons: A record of the alteration and recycling of crust in the Early Archean|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X05002773|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|language=en|volume=235|issue=3–4|pages=663–681|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2005.04.028|issn=0012-821X|last1=Cavosie|first1=A.J.|last2=Valley|first2=J.W.|last3=Wilde|first3=S.A.|last4=e.i.m.f}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this model helps provide a mechanism for how plate tectonics could have been triggered on Earth, although it does not demonstrate that subduction was initiated at the earliest confirmed presence of water on Earth. Based on these models, the onset of subduction and plate tectonics is dated at 3.6Ga.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Late Heavy Bombardment ===
Impact cratering also had consequences for both the development of plume-induced subduction and the establishment of global plate tectonics.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The steepening of geothermal gradients could have directly enhanced convective mantle transport which now beneath an increasingly fractured lithosphere could have created stresses great enough to cause rifting and the separation of crust into plates.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Crustal growth rates ==
[[File:Growthcurve.png|thumb|331x331px|Plots showing the rate of continental crustal growth over time as a percentage of the total mass, along with associated thickness of the newly generated crust. The plot of crustal reworking represents the amount of post formational alteration undergone by the crust. The dramatic increase in crustal reworking and reduction in the rate of crustal growth at approximately 3.6Ga represents the onset of subduction and plate tectonics. Modified from &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;]]

=== Lithological dating ===
Crustal growth rates can be used to calculate estimates for the age of the continental crust. This can be done through analysis of [[igneous rock]]s with the same [[Isotope|isotopic]] composition as initial mantle rock. These igneous rocks are dated and assumed to be direct evidence of new continental crust formation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The resulting ages of isotopically juvenile igneous rocks give distinct peaks, representing an increased proportion of igneous rock and therefore increased crust growth, at 2.7, 1.9 and 1.2 Ga. The validity of these results is questioned as the peaks could represent periods of preservation rather than increased continental crust generation. This is reinforced by the fact that such peaks are not observed in recent geologic time where it is given that [[magmatism]] resulting from the plate subduction has strongly contributed to producing new crust.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawkesworth|first=C. J.|last2=Kemp|first2=A. I. S.|date=2006-10-19|title=Evolution of the continental crust|journal=Nature|volume=443|issue=7113|pages=811–817|doi=10.1038/nature05191|issn=1476-4687|pmid=17051208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crustal growth rates from igneous rocks can be compared to the rates generated from [[Radiogenic nuclide|radiogenic]] isotope ratios in sedimentary rocks. Projections of growth rates using these techniques does not produce staggered peaks, instead smooth shallow curves presenting a more constant rate of crustal growth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although representative of large periods of time, limitations are found where samples do not solely represent magmatic production events. Instead samples include the mixing of sediments which produces a mix of original and altered isotope ratios.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Zircon dating ===
[[Zircon]] minerals can be both [[Detritus (geology)|detrital]] grains from sedimentary rocks and crystals in igneous rocks. Therefore, a combination of zircon forms can provide a more accurate estimate of crustal growth rates. Further to this, zircon minerals can be subject to [[Hafnium|Hf]] and [[Oxygen|O]] isotope ratio analysis.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This is important as Hf isotopes indicate whether a rock originates from the mantle or an existing rock. High δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O values of zircons represent rock recycled at the Earth's surface and thus potentially producing mixed samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Condie|first=K. C.|date=2014-06|title=Growth of continental crust: a balance between preservation and recycling|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/minmag/article/78/3/623/85695/growth-of-continental-crust-a-balance-between|journal=Mineralogical Magazine|language=en|volume=78|issue=3|pages=623–637|doi=10.1180/minmag.2014.078.3.11|issn=0026-461X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of this combined analysis is valid zircons showing periods of increased crustal generation at at 1.9 and 3.3Ga, the latter of which representing the time period following the commencement of global plate tectonics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Eye tracking''' is the process of measuring either the point of [[gaze (physiology)|gaze]] (where one is looking) or the motion of an eye relative to the head.  An '''eye tracker''' is a device for measuring eye positions and [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]].  Eye trackers are used in research on the [[visual system]], in psychology, in [[psycholinguistics]], marketing, as an input device for [[human-computer interaction]], and in product design.  There are a number of methods for measuring eye movement.  The most popular variant uses video images from which the eye position is extracted.  Other methods use [[search coil]]s or are based on the [[electrooculography|electrooculogram]].

== History ==
In the 1800s, studies of eye movement were made using direct observations.

In 1879 in Paris, [[Louis Émile Javal]] observed that reading does not involve a smooth sweeping of the eyes along the text, as previously assumed, but a series of short stops (called fixations) and quick [[saccade]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Reported in Huey 1908/1968.&lt;/ref&gt;  This observation raised important questions about reading, questions which were explored during the 1900s: On which words do the eyes stop? For how long? When do they regress to already seen words?

[[File:Reading Fixations Saccades.jpg|thumb|left|320px|An example of fixations and saccades over text. This is the typical pattern of eye movement during reading. The eyes never move smoothly over still text.]]
Edmund Huey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huey|first=Edmund|title=The Psychology and Pedagogy of Reading (Reprint)|publisher=MIT Press 1968 (originally published 1908)}}&lt;/ref&gt; built an early eye tracker, using a sort of contact lens with a hole for the [[pupil]]. The lens was connected to an aluminum pointer that moved in response to the movement of the eye. Huey studied and quantified regressions (only a small proportion of saccades are regressions), and he showed that some words in a sentence are not fixated.

The first non-intrusive eye-trackers were built by Guy Thomas Buswell in Chicago, using beams of light that were reflected on the eye and then recording them on film. Buswell made systematic studies into reading&lt;ref&gt;Buswell (1922, 1937)&lt;/ref&gt; and picture viewing.&lt;ref&gt;(1935)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, [[Alfred L. Yarbus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; did important eye tracking research and his 1967 book is often quoted. He showed that the task given to a subject has a very large influence on the subject's eye movement. He also wrote about the relation between fixations and interest:

:"All the records ... show conclusively that the character of the eye movement is either completely independent of or only very slightly dependent on the material of the picture and how it was made, provided that it is flat or nearly flat."&lt;ref name="Yarbus 1967 190"&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cyclical pattern in the examination of pictures "is dependent on not only what is shown on the picture, but also the problem facing the observer and the information that he hopes to gain from the picture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Yarbus The Visitor.jpg|thumb|right|320px|This study by {{Harvtxt|Yarbus|1967}} is often referred to as evidence on how the task given to a person influences his or her eye movement.]]
:"Records of eye movements show that the observer's attention is usually held only by certain elements of the picture.... Eye movement reflects the human thought processes; so the observer's thought may be followed to some extent from records of eye movement (the thought accompanying the examination of the particular object). It is easy to determine from these records which elements attract the observer's eye (and, consequently, his thought), in what order, and how often."&lt;ref name="Yarbus 1967 190"/&gt;

:"The observer's attention is frequently drawn to elements which do not give important information but which, in his opinion, may do so. Often an observer will focus his attention on elements that are unusual in the particular circumstances, unfamiliar, incomprehensible, and so on."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"... when changing its points of fixation, the observer's eye repeatedly returns to the same elements of the picture. Additional time spent on perception is not used to examine the secondary elements, but to reexamine the most important elements."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, eye-tracking research expanded rapidly, particularly reading research. A good overview of the research in this period is given by [[Dr. Keith Rayner|Rayner]].&lt;ref&gt;Rayner (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Just and Carpenter&lt;ref&gt;Just and Carpenter (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; formulated the influential ''Strong eye-mind hypothesis'', that "there is no appreciable lag between what is fixated and what is processed". If this hypothesis is correct, then when a subject looks at a word or object, he or she also thinks about it (process cognitively), and for exactly as long as the recorded fixation. The hypothesis is often taken for granted by researchers using eye-tracking. However, [[Gaze-contingency paradigm|gaze-contingent techniques]] offer an interesting option in order to disentangle overt and covert attentions, to differentiate what is fixated and what is processed.

During the 1980s, the eye-mind hypothesis was often questioned in light of covert attention,&lt;ref&gt;Posner (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright &amp; Ward (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; the attention to something that one is not looking at, which people often do. If covert attention is common during eye-tracking recordings, the resulting scan-path and fixation patterns would often show not where our attention has been, but only where the eye has been looking, failing to indicate cognitive processing.

The 1980s also saw the birth of using eye-tracking to answer questions related to human-computer interaction.  Specifically, researchers investigated how users search for commands in computer menus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.100.445&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Download Limit Exceeded|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, computers allowed researchers to use eye-tracking results in real time, primarily to help disabled users.&lt;ref name="Download Limit Exceeded"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.100.445&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf%5D,|title=Download Limit Exceeded|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, there has been growth in using eye tracking to study how users interact with different computer interfaces. Specific questions researchers ask are related to how easy different interfaces are for users.&lt;ref name="Download Limit Exceeded"/&gt;  The results of the eye tracking research can lead to changes in design of the interface. Yet another recent area of research focuses on Web development. This can include how users react to drop-down menus or where they focus their attention on a website so the developer knows where to place an advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmi-interaktiv.de/uploads/media/MMI-Interaktiv0303_SchiesslDudaThoelkeFischer.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hoffman,&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 1998&lt;/ref&gt; current consensus is that visual attention is always slightly (100 to 250 ms) ahead of the eye. But as soon as attention moves to a new position, the eyes will want to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T0W-3VXNHBP-10&amp;_user=952938&amp;_coverDate=06%2F30%2F1996&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000049220&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=952938&amp;md5=4f7fbf4f015fde59aa9a39b30154e7f3 | doi=10.1016/0042-6989(95)00294-4 | volume=36 | title=Saccade target selection and object recognition: Evidence for a common attentional mechanism | year=1996 | journal=Vision Research | pages=1827–1837 | last1 = Deubel | first1 = Heiner | pmid=8759451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We still cannot infer specific cognitive processes directly from a fixation on a particular object in a scene.&lt;ref&gt;Holsanova 2007&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a fixation on a face in a picture may indicate recognition, liking, dislike, puzzlement etc. Therefore, eye tracking is often coupled with other methodologies, such as [[Protocol analysis|introspective verbal protocols]].

== Tracker types ==
Eye-trackers measure rotations of the eye in one of several ways, but principally they fall into three categories: (i) measurement of the movement of an object (normally, a special contact lens) attached to the eye; (ii) optical tracking without direct contact to the eye; and (iii) measurement of electric potentials using electrodes placed around the eyes.

=== Eye-attached tracking ===
The first type uses an attachment to the eye, such as a special contact lens with an embedded mirror or magnetic field sensor, and the movement of the attachment is measured with the assumption that it does not slip significantly as the eye rotates. Measurements with tight-fitting contact lenses have provided extremely sensitive recordings of eye movement, and magnetic search coils are the method of choice for researchers studying the dynamics and underlying physiology of eye movement. This method allows the measurement of eye movement in horizontal, vertical and torsion directions.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Robinson: A method of measuring eye movement using a scleral search coil in a magnetic field, IEEE Transactions on Bio-Medical Electronics, October 1963, 137–145 ([http://ebooks.yasse.ir/ebooks/IEEE_Journals/Bio-Medical_Electronics_IRE_T/A_Method_of_Measuring_Eye_Movemnent_Using_a_Scieral_Search_Coil_in_a_Magnetic_Field-274.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Optical tracking ===
[[File:EYE-SYNC eye-tracking analyzer.JPG|thumb|An eye-tracking [[head-mounted display]]. Each eye has an LED light source (gold-color metal) on the side of the display lens, and a camera under the display lens.]]
The second broad category uses some non-contact, optical method for measuring eye motion. Light, typically infrared, is reflected from the eye and sensed by a video camera or some other specially designed optical sensor. The information is then analyzed to extract eye rotation from changes in reflections. Video-based eye trackers typically use the corneal reflection (the first [[Purkinje images|Purkinje image]]) and the center of the pupil as features to track over time. A more sensitive type of eye-tracker, the dual-Purkinje eye tracker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1364/AO.24.000527|last=Crane|first=H.D.|author2=Steele, C.M.|title=Generation-V dual-Purkinje-image eyetracker|journal=Applied Optics|volume=24|issue=4|pages=527–537|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses reflections from the front of the cornea (first Purkinje image) and the back of the lens (fourth Purkinje image) as features to track. A still more sensitive method of tracking is to image features from inside the eye, such as the retinal blood vessels, and follow these features as the eye rotates. Optical methods, particularly those based on video recording, are widely used for gaze-tracking and are favored for being non-invasive and inexpensive.
{{See also|Video-oculography}}

=== Electric potential measurement ===
The third category uses electric potentials measured with electrodes placed around the eyes. The eyes are the origin of a steady electric potential field which can also be detected in total darkness and if the eyes are closed. It can be modelled to be generated by a dipole with its positive pole at the cornea and its negative pole at the retina. The electric signal that can be derived using two pairs of contact electrodes placed on the skin around one eye is called [[EOG|Electrooculogram (EOG)]]. If the eyes move from the centre position towards the periphery, the retina approaches one electrode while the cornea approaches the opposing one. This change in the orientation of the dipole and consequently the electric potential field results in a change in the measured EOG signal. Inversely, by analysing these changes in eye movement can be tracked. Due to the discretisation given by the common electrode setup, two separate movement components – a horizontal and a vertical – can be identified. A third EOG component is the radial EOG channel,&lt;ref&gt;Elbert, T., Lutzenberger, W., Rockstroh, B., Birbaumer, N., 1985. Removal of ocular artifacts from the EEG. A biophysical approach to the EOG. Electroencephalogr Clin Neurophysiol 60, 455-463.&lt;/ref&gt; which is the average of the EOG channels referenced to some posterior scalp electrode. This radial EOG channel is sensitive to the saccadic spike potentials stemming from the extra-ocular muscles at the onset of saccades, and allows reliable detection of even miniature saccades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keren | first1 = A.S. | last2 = Yuval-Greenberg | first2 = S. | last3 = Deouell | first3 = L.Y. | year = 2010 | title = Saccadic spike potentials in gamma-band EEG: Characterization, detection and suppression | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 2248–2263 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.10.057 | pmid=19874901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to potential drifts and variable relations between the EOG signal amplitudes and the saccade sizes, it is challenging to use EOG for measuring slow eye movement and detecting gaze direction. EOG is, however, a very robust technique for measuring [[saccade|saccadic eye movement]] associated with gaze shifts and detecting [[blink]]s. 
Contrary to video-based eye-trackers, EOG allows recording of eye movements even with eyes closed, and can thus be used in sleep research. It is a very light-weight approach that, in contrast to current video-based eye-trackers, requires only very low computational power; works under different lighting conditions; and can be implemented as an embedded, self-contained wearable system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulling|first=A. |author2=Roggen, D. |author3=Tröster, G.|year=2009|title=Wearable EOG goggles: Seamless sensing and context-awareness in everyday environments|journal=Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Smart Environments (JAISE)|volume=1|pages=157–171|issue=2|doi=10.3233/AIS-2009-0020}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus the method of choice for measuring eye movement in mobile daily-life situations and [[rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] phases during sleep.  The major disadvantage of EOG is its relatively poor gaze-direction accuracy compared to a video tracker.  That is, it is difficult to determine with good accuracy exactly where a subject is looking, though the time of eye movements can be determined.

==Technologies and techniques==

The most widely used current designs are video-based eye-trackers. A camera focuses on one or both eyes and records eye movement as the viewer looks at some kind of stimulus. Most modern eye-trackers use the center of the pupil and [[infrared]] / [[near-infrared]] non-collimated light to create [[corneal reflection]]s (CR). The vector between the pupil center and the corneal reflections can be used to compute the point of regard on surface or the gaze direction. A simple calibration procedure of the individual is usually needed before using the eye tracker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Witzner Hansen|first=Dan|author2=Qiang Ji|title=In the Eye of the Beholder: A Survey of Models for Eyes and Gaze|journal=IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell.|date=March 2010|volume=32|issue=3|pages=478–500|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1729561|doi=10.1109/tpami.2009.30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two general types of infrared / near-infrared (also known as active light) eye-tracking techniques are used: bright-pupil and dark-pupil. Their difference is based on the location of the illumination source with respect to the optics. If the illumination is [[coaxial]] with the optical path, then the eye acts as a [[retroreflector]] as the light reflects off the [[retina]] creating a bright pupil effect similar to [[Red-eye effect|red eye]]. If the illumination source is offset from the optical path, then the pupil appears dark because the retroreflection from the retina is directed away from the camera.&lt;ref name=gneo&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gneo|first1=Massimo|last2=Schmid|first2=Maurizio|last3=Conforto|first3=Silvia|last4=D’Alessio|first4=Tommaso|title=A free geometry model-independent neural eye-gaze tracking system|journal=Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation|date=2012|volume=9|issue=1|pages=82|doi=10.1186/1743-0003-9-82}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Bright-pupil tracking creates greater iris/pupil contrast, allowing more robust eye-tracking with all iris pigmentation, and greatly reduces interference caused by eyelashes and other obscuring features.&lt;ref&gt;The Eye: A Survey of Human Vision; Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; It also allows tracking in lighting conditions ranging from total darkness to very bright.

Another, less used, method is known as passive light. It uses visible light to illuminate, something which may cause some distractions to users.&lt;ref name=gneo/&gt; Another challenge with this method is that the contrast of the pupil is less than in the active light methods, therefore, the center of [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is used for calculating the vector instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sigut|first1=J|last2=Sidha|first2=SA|title=Iris center corneal reflection method for gaze tracking using visible light.|journal=IEEE Transactions on Bio-medical Engineering|date=February 2011|volume=58|issue=2|pages=411–9|pmid=20952326|doi=10.1109/tbme.2010.2087330}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This calculation needs to detect the boundary of the iris and the white [[sclera]] ([[Corneal limbus|limbus]] tracking).

Eye-tracking setups vary greatly: some are head-mounted, some require the head to be stable (for example, with a chin rest), and some function remotely and automatically track the head during motion.  Most use a sampling rate of at least 30&amp;nbsp;Hz. Although 50/60&amp;nbsp;Hz is more common, today many video-based eye trackers run at 240, 350 or even 1000/1250&amp;nbsp;Hz, speeds needed in order to capture fixational eye movements or correctly measure saccade dynamics.

Eye movements are typically divided into [[fixation (visual)|fixations]] and saccades – when the eye gaze pauses in a certain position, and when it moves to another position, respectively. The resulting series of fixations and saccades is called a [[scanpath]]. Smooth pursuit describes the eye following a moving object. Fixational eye movements include [[microsaccade]]s: small, involuntary saccades that occur during attempted fixation. Most information from the eye is made available during a fixation or smooth pursuit, but not during a saccade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Purves |first=D |author2=st al. |date=2001 |title=Neuroscience, 2d ed. |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11156/ |location=Sunderland (MA)|publisher=Sinauer Assocs. |page=What Eye Movements Accomplish|isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scanpaths are useful for analyzing cognitive intent, interest, and salience.  Other biological factors (some as simple as gender) may affect the scanpath as well. Eye tracking in [[human–computer interaction]] (HCI) typically investigates the scanpath for usability purposes, or as a method of input in [[gaze-contingency paradigm|gaze-contingent displays]], also known as [[gaze-based interfaces]].&lt;ref&gt;Majaranta, P., Aoki, H., Donegan, M., Hansen, D.W., Hansen, J.P., Hyrskykari, A., Räihä, K.J., ''Gaze Interaction and Applications of Eye Tracking: Advances in Assistive Technologies'', IGI Global, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data presentation ==

Interpretation of the data that is recorded by the various types of eye-trackers employs a variety of software that animates or visually represents it, so that the visual behavior of one or more users can be graphically resumed. The video is generally manually coded to identify the AOIs(Area Of Interests) or recently using artificial intelligence. Graphical presentation is rarely the basis of research results, since they are limited in terms of what can be analysed - research relying on eye-tracking, for example, usually requires quantitative measures of the eye movement events and their parameters, The following visualisations are the most commonly used:

'''Animated representations of a point on the interface'''
This method is used when the visual behavior is examined individually indicating where the user focused their gaze in each moment, complemented with a small path that indicates the previous saccade movements, as seen in the image.

'''Static representations of the saccade path'''
This is fairly similar to the one described above, with the difference that this is static method. A higher level of expertise than with the animated ones is required to interpret this.

'''Heat maps'''
An alternative static representation, used mainly for the agglomerated analysis of the visual exploration patterns in a group of users. In these representations, the ‘hot’ zones or zones with higher density designate where the users focused their gaze (not their attention) with a higher frequency. Heat maps are the best known visualization technique for eyetracking studies.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Jakob. Pernice, Kara. (2010).

'''Blind zones maps, or focus maps'''
This method is a simplified version of the Heat maps where the visually less attended zones by the users are displayed clearly, thus allowing for an easier understanding of the most relevant information, that is to say, we are informed about which zones were not seen by the users.

== Eye-tracking vs. gaze-tracking ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Gaze Tracking Example.jpg|thumb|left|An example of eye gaze trace overlay.]] --&gt;Eye-trackers necessarily measure the rotation of the eye with respect to some frame of reference. This is usually tied to the measuring system. Thus, if the measuring system is head-mounted, as with EOG or a video-based system mounted to a helmet, then eye-in-head angles are measured. To deduce the line of sight in world coordinates, the head must be kept in a constant position or its movements must be tracked as well. In these cases, head direction is added to eye-in-head direction to determine gaze direction.

If the measuring system is table-mounted, as with scleral search coils or table-mounted camera (“remote”) systems, then gaze angles are measured directly in world coordinates. Typically, in these situations head movements are prohibited. For example, the head position is fixed using a bite bar or a forehead support. Then a head-centered reference frame is identical to a world-centered reference frame. Or colloquially, the eye-in-head position directly determines the gaze direction.

Some results are available on human eye movements under natural conditions where head movements are allowed as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Einhäuser | first1 = W | last2 = Moeller | first2 = GU | last3 = Schumann | first3 = F | last4 = Conradt | first4 = J | last5 = Vockeroth | first5 = J | last6 = Bartl | first6 = K | last7 = Schneider | first7 = E | last8 = König | first8 = P | year = 2009 | title = Eye-head coordination during free exploration in human and cat | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1164 | issue = | pages = 353–366 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2008.03709.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Einhäuser W, Schumann F, Bardins S, Bartl K, Böning G, Schneider E and König P (2007).

== Eye tracking in practice ==
A great deal of research has gone into studies of the mechanisms and dynamics of eye rotation, but the goal of eye- tracking is most often to estimate gaze direction. Users may be interested in what features of an image draw the eye, for example. It is important to realize that the eye-tracker does not provide absolute gaze direction, but rather can measure only changes in gaze direction. In order to know precisely what a subject is looking at, some calibration procedure is required in which the subject looks at a point or series of points, while the eye tracker records the value that corresponds to each gaze position. (Even those techniques that track features of the retina cannot provide exact gaze direction because there is no specific anatomical feature that marks the exact point where the visual axis meets the retina, if indeed there is such a single, stable point.) An accurate and reliable calibration is essential for obtaining valid and repeatable eye movement data, and this can be a significant challenge for non-verbal subjects or those who have unstable gaze.

Each method of eye-tracking has advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of an eye-tracking system depends on considerations of cost and application. There are offline methods and online procedures like [[AttentionTracking]]. There is a trade-off between cost and sensitivity, with the most sensitive systems costing many tens of thousands of dollars and requiring considerable expertise to operate properly. Advances in computer and video technology have led to the development of relatively low-cost systems that are useful for many applications and fairly easy to use. Interpretation of the results still requires some level of expertise, however, because a misaligned or poorly calibrated system can produce wildly erroneous data.

===Eye-tracking while driving a car in a difficult situation===

[[Image:Eye movements of drivers.jpg|300px | frame| right |Frames from narrow road eye tracking described in this section&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Werner Hunziker, (2006) Im Auge des Lesers: foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung - vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude [In the eye of the reader: foveal and peripheral perception - from letter recognition to the joy of reading] Transmedia Stäubli Verlag Zürich 2006 {{ISBN|978-3-7266-0068-6}} Based on data from:Cohen, A. S. (1983). Informationsaufnahme beim Befahren von Kurven, Psychologie für die Praxis 2/83, Bulletin der Schweizerischen Stiftung für Angewandte Psychologie&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The eye movement of two groups of drivers have been filmed with a special head camera by a team of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology: Novice and experienced drivers had their eye-movement recorded while approaching a bend of a narrow road.
The series of images has been condensed from the original film frames&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, A. S. (1983). Informationsaufnahme beim Befahren von Kurven, Psychologie für die Praxis 2/83, Bulletin der Schweizerischen Stiftung für Angewandte Psychologie&lt;/ref&gt; to show 2 eye fixations per image for better comprehension.

Each of these stills corresponds to approximately 0.5 seconds in realtime.

The series of images shows an example of eye fixations #9 to #14 of a typical novice and an experienced driver.

Comparison of the top images shows that the experienced driver checks the curve and even has Fixation No. 9 left to look aside while the novice driver needs to check the road and estimate his distance to the parked car.

In the middle images, the experienced driver is now fully concentrating on the location where an oncoming car could be seen. The novice driver concentrates his view on the parked car.

In the bottom image the novice is busy estimating the distance between the left wall and the parked car, while the experienced driver can use his [[peripheral vision]] for that and still concentrate his view on the dangerous point of the curve: If a car appears there, he has to give way, i. e. stop to the right instead of passing the parked car.&lt;ref&gt;Pictures from: Hans-Werner Hunziker, (2006) Im Auge des Lesers: foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung – vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude  [In the eye of the reader: foveal and peripheral perception – from letter recognition to the joy of reading] Transmedia Stäubli Verlag Zürich 2006 {{ISBN|978-3-7266-0068-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eye-tracking of younger and elderly people while walking===

While walking, elderly subjects depend more on foveal vision than do younger subjects. Their walking speed is decreased by a limited [[visual field]], probably caused by a deteriorated peripheral vision.

Younger subjects make use of both their central and peripheral vision while walking. Their peripheral vision allows faster control over the process of walking.&lt;ref&gt;Itoh N, Fukuda T. (2002) [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pms.2002.94.3c.1283 Comparative study of eye movement in extent of central and peripheral vision and use by young and elderly walkers]. ''Percept Mot Skills.'' 2002 Jun;94(3 Pt 2):1283–91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
A wide variety of disciplines use eye-tracking techniques, including [[cognitive science]]; [[psychology]] (notably [[psycholinguistics]]; the visual world paradigm); [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI); [[human factors and ergonomics]]; [[marketing research]] and medical research (neurological diagnosis). Specific applications include the tracking eye movement in [[eye movement in language reading|language reading]], [[eye movement in music reading|music reading]], human [[activity recognition]], the perception of advertising, and the playing of sports.

===Commercial applications===
In recent years, the increased sophistication and accessibility of eye-tracking technologies have generated a great deal of interest in the commercial sector. Applications include [[web usability]], advertising, sponsorship, package design and automotive engineering. In general, commercial eye-tracking studies function by presenting a target stimulus to a sample of consumers while an eye tracker is used to record the activity of the eye. Examples of target stimuli may include websites; television programs; sporting events; films and commercials; magazines and newspapers; packages; shelf displays; consumer systems (ATMs, checkout systems, kiosks); and software. The resulting data can be statistically analyzed and graphically rendered to provide evidence of specific visual patterns. By examining fixations, [[saccades]], pupil dilation, blinks and a variety of other behaviors, researchers can determine a great deal about the effectiveness of a given medium or product. While some companies complete this type of research internally, there are many private companies that offer eye-tracking services and analysis.

One of the most prominent fields of commercial eye-tracking research is web usability.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} While traditional usability techniques are often quite powerful in providing information on clicking and scrolling patterns, eye-tracking offers the ability to analyze user interaction between the clicks and how much time a user spends between clicks, thereby providing valuable insight into which features are the most eye-catching, which features cause confusion and which are ignored altogether. Specifically, eye-tracking can be used to assess search efficiency, branding, online advertisements, navigation usability, overall design and many other site components. Analyses may target a prototype or competitor site in addition to the main client site.

Eye-tracking is commonly used in a variety of different advertising media. Commercials, print ads, online ads and sponsored programs are all conducive to analysis with current eye-tracking technology. For instance in newspapers, eye-tracking studies can be used to find out in what way advertisements should be mixed with the news in order to catch the reader’s eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.looktracker.com/blog/eye-tracking-case-study/eye-tracking-study-the-new-york-times-vs-the-wall-street-journal|title=LookTracker - Eye Tracking Services|website=www.looktracker.com|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analyses focus on visibility of a target product or logo in the context of a magazine, newspaper, website, or televised event. One example is an analysis of eye movements over advertisements in the [[Yellow pages|Yellow Pages]]. The study focused on what particular features caused people to notice an ad, whether they viewed ads in a particular order and how viewing times varied. The study revealed that ad size, graphics, color, and copy all influence attention to advertisements. Knowing this allows researchers to assess in great detail how often a sample of consumers fixates on the target logo, product or ad. As a result, an advertiser can quantify the success of a given campaign in terms of actual visual attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lohse |first=Gerald |last2=Wu |first2=D.

'''Generative art''' refers to [[art]] that in whole or in part has been created with the use of an autonomous system. An autonomous system in this context is generally one that is non-human and can independently determine features of an artwork that would otherwise require decisions made directly by the artist. In some cases the human creator may claim that the [[Generative systems|generative system]] represents their own artistic idea, and in others that the system takes on the role of the creator.

"Generative art" often refers to [[algorithmic art]] (algorithmically determined computer generated artwork), but artists can also make it using systems of [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[mechanics]] and [[robotics]], [[smart materials]], manual [[randomization]], [[mathematics]], [[data mapping]], [[symmetry]], [[Tessellation|tiling]], and more.

== History ==

The use of the word "generative" in the discussion of art has developed over time. The use of "[[Artificial DNA]]" defines a generative approach to art focused on the construction of a system able to generate unpredictable events, all with a recognizable common character. The use of [[autonomous robot|autonomous systems]], required by some contemporary definitions, focuses a generative approach where the controls are strongly reduced. This approach is also named "emergent". [[Margaret Boden]] and Ernest Edmonds have noted the use of the term "generative art" in the broad context of automated computer graphics in the 1960s, beginning with artwork exhibited by [[Georg Nees]] and [[Frieder Nake]] in 1965:&lt;ref name="Boden"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Boden, Margaret |author2=Edmonds, Ernest |author1link=Margaret Boden |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233128802_What_is_generative_art |title=What is Generative Art? |journal=Digital Creativity |date=2009 |volume=20 |issue=1/2 |pages=21–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 {{quotation | The  terms  "generative art"  and  "computer  art"  have been  used  in  tandem,  and  more  or  less interchangeably, since the very earliest days.&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt;}}

The first such exhibition showed the work of Nees in February 1965, which some claim was titled "Generative Computergrafik".&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt; While Nees does not himself remember, this was the title of his doctoral thesis published a few years later.&lt;ref name=Nake12&gt;{{cite web |last=Nake |first=Frieder |title=Georg Nees: Generative Computergrafik |url=http://dada.compart-bremen.de/node/3280 |publisher=University of Bremen |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correct title of the first exhibition and catalog was "computer-grafik".&lt;ref&gt;Ness, Georg; Bense, Max: ''computer-grafik''; Edition Rot 19; Stuttgart, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; "Generative art" and related terms was in common use by several other early computer artists around this time, including [[Manfred Mohr]].&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt; The term "Generative Art" with the meaning of dynamic artwork-systems able to generate multiple artwork-events was clearly used the first time for the "Generative Art" conference in Milan in 1998.

The term has also been used to describe geometric [[abstract art]] where simple elements are repeated, transformed, or varied to generate more complex forms. Thus defined, generative art was practised by the Argentinian artists Eduardo McEntyre and Miguel Ángel Vidal in the late 1960s. In 1972 the Romanian-born Paul Neagu created the Generative Art Group in Britain. It was populated exclusively by Neagu using aliases such as "Hunsy Belmood" and "Edward Larsocchi." In 1972 Neagu gave a lecture titled 'Generative Art Forms' at the [[Queen's University, Belfast]] Festival.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Harold, ed. ''The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Art'', Oxford ; New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, J. A. ''Glossary of art, architecture, and design since 1945 (3rd ed.)'', London; Boston: Library Association Publishing; G.K. Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] created a department called "Generative Systems." As described by [[Sonia Landy Sheridan]] the focus was on art practices using the then new technologies for the capture, inter-machine transfer, printing and transmission of images, as well as the exploration of the aspect of time in the transformation of image information.&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Sonia Landy. ''Generative Systems versus Copy Art: A Clarification of Terms and Ideas'', Leonardo, 16(2), 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 Clauser &lt;ref&gt;Clauser, H. R. ''Towards a Dynamic, Generative Computer Art'', Leonardo, 21(2), 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; identified the aspect of systemic autonomy as a critical element in generative art:

 {{quotation | It should be evident from the above description of the evolution of generative art that process (or structuring) and change (or transformation) are among its most definitive features, and that these features and the very term 'generative' imply dynamic development and motion. ...

(the result) is not a creation by the artist but rather the product of the generative process - a self-precipitating structure. }}

In 1989 Celestino Soddu defined the Generative Design approach to Architecture and Town Design in his book ''Citta' Aleatorie''.&lt;ref&gt;Soddu, C.  Citta' Aleatorie, Masson Publisher 1989 "[http://www.artscience-ebookshop.com/cittaaleatorie_book.htm]"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Franke referred to "generative mathematics" as "the study of mathematical operations suitable for generating artistic images."&lt;ref&gt;Franke, H. W.''Mathematics As an Artistic-Generative Principle'', Leonardo, Supplemental Issue, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-1990s [[Brian Eno]] popularized the terms [[generative music]] and generative systems, making a connection with earlier [[experimental music]] by [[Terry Riley]], [[Steve Reich]] and [[Philip Glass]].&lt;ref&gt;Eno, B. ''[http://www.inmotionmagazine.com/eno1.html  Generative Music]'', In Motion Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

From the end of the 20th century, communities of generative artists, designers, musicians and theoreticians began to meet, forming cross-disciplinary perspectives.  
The first meeting about generative Art was in 1998, at the inaugural International Generative Art conference at Politecnico di Milano University, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Soddu, C. and Colabella, E. ed.s "[http://www.artscience-ebookshop.com/ga98_book.htm Generative Art]", Dedalo&lt;/ref&gt; 
In Australia, the Iterate conference on generative systems in the electronic arts followed in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~iterate/FI/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  
On-line discussion has centred around the eu-gene mailing list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://generative.net/mailman/listinfo/eu-gene |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727083144/http://generative.net/mailman/listinfo/eu-gene |archivedate=2012-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which began late 1999, and has hosted much of the debate which has defined the field.&lt;ref name="Galanter2003" /&gt;{{rp|1}}  These activities have more recently been joined by the [http://www.generatorx.no/generatorx-introduction/ Generator.x] conference in Berlin starting in 2005.
In 2012 the new journal GASATHJ, Generative Art Science and Technology Hard Journal was founded by Celestino Soddu and Enrica Colabella &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gasathj.com  GASATHJ]&lt;/ref&gt; jointing several generative artists and scientists in the Editorial Board.

Some have argued that as a result of this engagement across disciplinary boundaries, the community has converged on a shared meaning of the term.  As Boden and Edmonds&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt; put it in 2011:

{{quotation | Today, the term "Generative Art" is still current within the relevant artistic community. Since 1998  a series  of  conferences  have been  held  in Milan with  that  title (Generativeart.com), and Brian Eno has been inﬂuential in promoting and using generative art methods (Eno, 1996). Both in music and in visual art, the use of the term has now converged on work that has been produced by the activation of a set of rules and where the artist lets a computer system take over at least some of the decision-making (although, of course, the artist determines the rules).}}

In the call of the Generative Art conferences in Milan (annually starting from 1998), the definition of Generative Art by Celestino Soddu:

{{quotation | Generative Art is the idea realized as genetic code of artificial events, as construction of dynamic complex systems able to generate endless variations. Each Generative Project is a concept-software that works producing unique and non-repeatable events, like music or 3D Objects, as possible and manifold expressions of the generating idea strongly recognizable as a vision belonging to an artist / designer / musician / architect /mathematician.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.generativeart.com Generative Art]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Discussion on the eu-gene mailing list was framed by the following definition by [[Adrian Ward (artist)|Adrian Ward]] from 1999:

{{quotation | Generative art is a term given to work which stems from concentrating on the processes involved in producing an artwork, usually (although not strictly) automated by the use of a machine or computer, or by using mathematic or pragmatic instructions to define the rules by which such artworks are executed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000901084825/http://www.generative.net/mailman/listinfo/eu-gene eu-gene mailing list welcome page]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A similar definition is provided by Philip Galanter:&lt;ref name="Galanter2003" /&gt;
{{quotation | Generative art refers to any art practice where the artist creates a process, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is then set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art.}}

==Types==

===Music===
{{Main article|Generative music}}
[[Johann Philipp Kirnberger]]'s "[[Musikalisches Würfelspiel]]" (Musical Dice Game) 1757 is considered an early example of a generative system based on randomness. Dice were used to select musical sequences from a numbered pool of previously composed phrases. This system provided a balance of order and disorder. The structure was based on an element of order on one hand, and disorder on the other.&lt;ref name="Algorithmic"&gt;Nierhaus, Gerhard (2009). ''Algorithmic Composition: Paradigms of Automated Music Generation'', pp. 36 &amp; 38n7. {{ISBN|9783211755396}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fugues]] of [[J.S. Bach]] could be considered generative, in that there is a strict underlying process that is followed by the composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Tim|title=Fugue 9: E Major. Well-Tempered Clavier, book 1. The Fugue is Generative|url=http://bach.nau.edu/clavier/nature/fugues/Fugue09.html|publisher=NAU.edu|accessdate=28 November 2017|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[serialism]] follows strict procedures which, in some cases, can be set up to generate entire compositions with limited human intervention.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Lerdahl|Lerdahl, Fred]]. 1988. "Cognitive Constraints on Compositional Systems". In ''Generative Processes in Music'', ed. John Sloboda. Oxford University Press. Reprinted in ''Contemporary Music Review'' 6, no. 2 (1992):97–121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lerdahl, Fred, and [[Ray Jackendoff]]. 1983. ''A Generative Theory of Tonal Music''. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Composers such as [[John Cage]],&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;[[Christiane Paul (curator)|Christiane Paul]] ''Digital Art'', Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13–15}} [[Farmers Manual]] and [[Brian Eno]]&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt;{{rp|133}} have used [[generative systems]] in their works.

===Visual art===
The artist [[Ellsworth Kelly]] created paintings by using chance operations to assign colors in a grid. He also created works on paper that he then cut into strips or squares and reassembled using chance operations to determine placement.&lt;ref&gt;Yve-Alain Bois, Jack Cowart, Alfred Pacquement ''Ellsworth Kelly: The Years in France, 1948-1954'', Washington DC, National Gallery of Art, Prestel, p. 23-26&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Calmoduline Monument.jpg|thumb|''Calmoduline Monument'', by [[Jean-Max Albert]], 1991]]

Artists such as [[Hans Haacke]] have explored processes of physical and social systems in artistic context.  
[[François Morellet]] has used both highly ordered and highly disordered systems in his artwork.  Some of his paintings feature regular systems of radial or parallel lines to create [[Moiré Patterns]]. In other works he has used chance operations to determine the coloration of grids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue16/colourchart3.htm Tate Online Article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325054818/http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue16/colourchart3.htm |date=2012-03-25 }} about [[François Morellet]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grace Glueck "Francois Morellet, Austere Abtractionism", New York Times, Feb. 22, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sol LeWitt]] created generative art in the form of systems expressed in [[natural language]] and systems of geometric [[permutation]]. [[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]]'s [[AARON]] system is a longstanding project combining software artificial intelligence with robotic painting devices to create physical artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurzweilcyberart.com/aaron/hi_cohenbio.html Biography of Harold Cohen] [[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Steina and Woody Vasulka]] are video art pioneers who used analog video feedback to create generative art. Video feedback is now cited as an example of deterministic chaos, and the early explorations by the Vasulkas anticipated contemporary science by many years.
Software systems exploiting [[evolutionary computing]] to create visual form include those created by [[Scott Draves]] and [[Karl Sims]].
The digital artist [[Joseph Nechvatal]] has exploited models of viral contagion.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Wands ''Art of the Digital Age'', London: Thames &amp; Hudson, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Autopoiesis'' by [[Ken Rinaldo]] includes fifteen musical and [[robotic]] sculptures that interact with the public and modify their behaviors based on both the presence of the participants and each other.&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt;{{rp|144–145}}
[[Jean-Pierre Hebert]] and [[Roman Verostko]] are founding members of the [[Algorists]], a group of artists who create their own algorithms to create art.
[[Michael Noll|A. Michael Noll]], of Bell Telephone Laboratories, Incorporated, programmed computer art using mathematical equations and programmed randomness, starting in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;A. Michael Noll, “The Digital Computer as a Creative Medium,” IEEE Spectrum, Vol. 4, No. 10, (October 1967), pp. 89-95; and “Computers and the Visual Arts,” Design and Planning 2: Computers in Design and Communication (Edited by Martin Krampen and Peter Seitz), Hastings House, Publishers, Inc.: New York (1967), pp. 65-79.&lt;/ref&gt;
The French artist [[Jean-Max Albert]], beside environmental sculptures like ''Iapetus'',&lt;ref&gt;Michel Ragon, Jean-Max Albert «Iapetus», L’art abstrait vol.5, Éditions Maeght, Paris, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and ''O=C=O'',&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Max Albert O=C=O, Franco Torriani, Dalla Land arte alla bioarte, Hopefulmonster editore Torino, 2007, p. 64-70&lt;/ref&gt; developed a project dedicated to the vegetation itself, in terms of biological activity. The ''Calmoduline Monument'' project is based on the property of a protein, [[calmodulin]], to bond selectively to calcium. Exterior physical constraints (wind, rain, etc.) modify the electric potential of the cellular membranes of a plant and consequently the flux of calcium. However, the calcium controls the expression of the calmoduline gene.&lt;ref&gt;Intra-and Intercellular Communications in Plants, Millet &amp; Greppin Editors, INRA, Paris, 1980, p.117.&lt;/ref&gt; The plant can thus, when there is a stimulus, modify its « typical » growth pattern. So the basic principle of this monumental sculpture is that to the extent that they could be picked up and transported, these signals could be enlarged, translated into colors and shapes, and show the plant’s « decisions » suggesting a level of fundamental biological activity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/L_espace_de_profil.html?id=PAlPAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Space in profile/ L'espace de profil,'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maurizio Bolognini]] works with generative machines to address conceptual and social concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Maurizio Bolognini, ''De l'interaction à la démocratie. Vers un art génératif post-digital''  ([http://www.bolognini.org/lectures/amx.htm From interactivity to democracy. Towards a post-digital generative art]), in {{citation|title= Ethique, esthétique, communication technologique dans l’art contemporain|year=2011|author=Actes du Colloque international Artmedia X|language=French|publisher=L’Harmattan|location=Paris|isbn=9782296132306}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Mark Napier (artist)|Mark Napier]] is a pioneer in data mapping, creating works based on the streams of zeros and ones in ethernet traffic, as part of the "Carnivore" project. [[Martin M. Wattenberg|Martin Wattenberg]] pushed this theme further, transforming "data sets" as diverse as musical scores (in "Shape of Song", 2001) and Wikipedia edits ([[History Flow]], 2003, with [[Fernanda Viegas]]) into dramatic visual compositions.
The Canadian artist [[San Base]] developed a "Dynamic Painting" algorithm in 2002. Using computer algorithms as "brush strokes," Base creates sophisticated imagery that evolves over time to produce a fluid, never-repeating artwork.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanbasestudio.com/about.htm San Base: About]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software art===
{{Main article|Software Art}}
For some artists, graphic user interfaces and computer code have become an independent art form in themselves. [[Adrian Ward (artist)|Adrian Ward]] created Auto-Illustrator as a commentary on software and generative methods applied to art and design.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Architecture===
In 1987 [[Celestino Soddu]] created the artificial DNA of Italian Medieval towns able to generate endless [[3D computer graphics|3D]] models of cities identifiable as belonging to the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Celestino Soddu [http://www.soddu.it/progetti/med.htm Soddu: "Italian Medieval Town"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
{{further information|Oulipo|The Eureka|Electronic literature|Spam Lit|Informationist poetry|Language game|Prehistoric Digital Poetry}}

Writers such as [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Brion Gysin]], and [[William Burroughs]] used the [[cut-up technique]] to introduce randomization to literature as a generative system. [[Jackson Mac Low]] produced computer-assisted poetry and used algorithms to generate texts; [[Philip M. Parker#Automatically generated books|Philip M. Parker]] has written software to automatically generate entire books. [[Jason Nelson]] used generative methods with Speech-to-Text software to create a series of digital poems from movies, television and other audio sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Flores |first1=Leonardo |title=The Battery Life of Meaning: Speech to Text Poetry” |url=http://iloveepoetry.com/?p=324 |website=I love E-Poetry |accessdate=9 February 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704155151/http://iloveepoetry.com/?p=324 |archivedate=4 July 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live coding===
{{Main article|Live coding}}
Generative systems may be modified while they operate, for example by using interactive programming environments such as [[Max/MSP]], [[vvvv]], [[Fluxus (programming environment)|Fluxus]], [[Isadora (software)|Isadora]], [[Quartz Composer]] and [[openFrameworks]]. This is a standard approach to programming by artists, but may also be used to create live music and/or video by manipulating generative systems on stage, a performance practice that has become known as [[live coding]]. As with many examples of [[software art]], because live coding emphasises human authorship rather than autonomy, it may be considered in opposition to generative art.&lt;ref name=McLean11&gt;{{cite book |last=McLean |first=Alex |title=Artist-Programmers and Programming Languages for the Arts |year=2011 |publisher=Goldsmiths, University of London (PhD Thesis)|pages=16–17 |url=http://yaxu.org/writing/thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Philip Galanter===

In the most widely cited theory of generative art, in 2003 Philip Galanter&lt;ref name="Galanter2003"&gt;Philip Galanter [http://philipgalanter.com/downloads/ga2003_what_is_genart.pdf ''What is Generative Art? Complexity theory as a context for art theory''], 2003 International Conference on Generative Art&lt;/ref&gt; describes generative art systems in the context of complexity theory. In particular the notion of [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Seth Lloyd]]'s [[effective complexity]] is cited. In this view both highly ordered and highly disordered generative art can be viewed as simple. Highly ordered generative art minimizes [[entropy]] and allows maximal [[data compression]], and highly disordered generative art maximizes entropy and disallows significant data compression. Maximally complex generative art blends order and disorder in a manner similar to biological life, and indeed biologically inspired methods are most frequently used to create complex generative art. This view is at odds with the earlier [[information theory]] influenced views of [[Max Bense]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Bense|Bense, Max]] ''Aesthetica; Einfuehrung in die neue Aesthetik'', Agis-Verlag&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Abraham Moles]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Moles|Moles, Abraham]]. ''Information theory and esthetic perception'', University of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt; where complexity in art increases with disorder.

Galanter notes further that given the use of visual symmetry, pattern, and repetition by the most ancient known cultures generative art is as old as art itself. He also addresses the mistaken equivalence by some that rule-based art is synonymous with generative art. For example, some art is based on constraint rules that disallow the use of certain colors or shapes. Such art is not generative because constraint rules are not constructive, i.e. by themselves they don't assert what is to be done, only what cannot be done.&lt;ref&gt;Galanter, Philip. [http://philipgalanter.com/downloads/vague_terrain_2006.pdf ''Generative art and rules-based art.''], Vague Terrain (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Margaret Boden and Ernest Edmonds===

In their 2009 article, [[Margaret Boden]] and Ernest Edmonds agree that generative art need not be restricted to that done using computers, and that some rule-based art is not generative. They develop a technical vocabulary that includes Ele-art (electronic art), C-art ([[computer art]]), D-art (digital art), CA-art (computer assisted art), G-art (generative art), CG-art (computer based generative art), Evo-art (evolutionary based art), R-art (robotic art), I-art (interactive art), CI-art (computer based interactive art), and VR-art (virtual reality art).&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt;
&lt;!--
In both accounts the term generative art does not describe an [[art movement]], [[ideology]], or theory of [[aesthetics]]. The term refers to how the art is made, and does not take into account why it was made or what the content of the artwork is.--&gt;&lt;!--this is WP:OR, an editor's opinion--&gt;

=== Questions ===

The discourse around generative art can be characterised by the theoretical questions which motivate its development. McCormack et al. propose the following questions, shown with paraphrased summaries, as the most important:&lt;ref name=McC&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCormack |first=Jon |author2=Oliver Bown |author3=Alan Dorin |author4=Jonathan McCabe |author5=Gordon Monro |author6=Mitchell Whitelaw |title=Ten Questions Concerning Generative Computer Art |journal=Leonardo |year=forthcoming |url=http://diotima.infotech.monash.edu.au/~jonmc/sa/news/ten-questions-concerning-generative-computer-art/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121129225520/http://diotima.infotech.monash.edu.au/~jonmc/sa/news/ten-questions-concerning-generative-computer-art/ |archivedate=2012-11-29 |date=2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Can a machine originate anything?  ''Related to [[machine intelligence]] - can a machine generate something new, meaningful, surprising and of value: a poem, an artwork, a useful idea, a solution to a long-standing problem?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What is it like to be a computer that makes art?  ''If a computer could originate art, what would it be like from the computer's perspective?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# Can human aesthetics be formalised?&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What new kinds of art does the computer enable?  ''Many generative artworks do not involve digital computers, but what does generative computer art bring that is new?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# In what sense is generative art representational, and what is it representing?&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What is the role of randomness in generative art? ''For example, what does the use of randomness say about the place of intentionality in the making of art?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What can computational generative art tell us about creativity? ''How could generative art give rise to artefacts and ideas that are new, surprising and valuable?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What characterises good generative art? ''How can we form a more critical understanding of generative art?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;

The '''Harvard College Observatory''' ('''HCO''') is an institution managing a complex of buildings and multiple instruments used for [[astronomy|astronomical]] research by the [[Harvard University]] Department of Astronomy. It is located in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], USA, and was founded in 1839. With the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]], it forms part of the [[Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]].

HCO houses a collection of approximately 500,000 [[Photographic_plate#Astronomy|astronomical plates]] taken between the mid-1880s and 1989 (with a gap from 1953–68).&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Great Refractor.jpg|thumb|Sketch of Harvard's [[Great Refractor]] telescope]]
In 1839, the Harvard Corporation voted to appoint [[William Cranch Bond]], a prominent Boston clockmaker, as "Astronomical Observer to the University" (at no salary). This marked the founding of the Harvard College Observatory. HCO's first telescope, the 15-inch [[Great Refractor]], was installed in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web 
| url = http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hco/grref.html 
| title = The Great Refractor 
| accessdate = 2008-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  That telescope was the largest in the United States from installation until 1867.&lt;ref name=TDA&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drout|first1=Maria|title=A Big Step Backward for Time Domain Astronomy|journal=Astrobites|date=12 November 2012|url=http://astrobites.org/2012/11/12/a-big-step-backward-for-time-domain-astronomy/|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1847 and 1852 Bond and pioneer photographer [[John Adams Whipple]] used the [[Great Refractor]] telescope to produce images of the moon that are remarkable in their clarity of detail and aesthetic power. This was the largest telescope in North America at that time, and their images of the moon took the prize for technical excellence in photography at the 1851 [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] at [[The Crystal Palace]] in [[London]]. On the night of July 16–17, 1850, Whipple and Bond made the first [[daguerreotype]] of a star (Vega).

Harvard College Observatory is historically important to astronomy, as many women including [[Annie Jump Cannon]], [[Henrietta Swan Leavitt]], [[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin]], and [[Williamina Fleming]] performed pivotal [[stellar classification]] research.  Cannon and Leavitt were hired initially  as "[[Harvard Computers|computer]]s" to perform calculations and examine stellar photographs, but later made insightful connections in their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Publications==
From 1898 to 1926, a series of ''Bulletin''s were issued containing many of the major discoveries of the period.  These were then replaced by ''Announcement Card''s which continued to be issued until 1952.

In 1908, the observatory published the [[Harvard Revised Photometry Catalogue]], which gave rise to the ''HR'' star catalogue, now maintained by the [[Yale University Observatory]] as the [[Bright Star Catalogue]].

'''Headphones''' (or '''head-phones''' in the early days of telephony and radio) are a pair of small loudspeaker drivers worn on or around the head over a user's ears. They are [[electroacoustics (acoustical engineering)|electroacoustic]] [[transducer]]s, which convert an [[electrical signal]] to a corresponding [[sound]]. Headphones let a single user listen to an audio source privately, in contrast to a [[loudspeaker]], which emits sound into the open air for anyone nearby to hear.   Headphones are also known as '''earspeakers, earphones'''&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/earphone |title=earphone |accessdate=4 January 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119123425/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/earphone |archivedate=19 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or, [[colloquially]], '''cans'''.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley R. Alten ''Audio Basics'' Cengage 2011 {{ISBN|0-495-91356-1}} page&amp;nbsp;63&lt;/ref&gt; Circumaural ('around the ear') and supra-aural ('over the ear') headphones use a band over the top of the head to hold the speakers in place.  The other type, known as '''earbuds''' or '''earpieces'''&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; consist of individual units that plug into the user's ear canal.  In the context of [[telecommunication]], a [[Headset (audio)|headset]] is a combination of headphone and [[microphone]]. Headphones connect to a signal source such as an audio [[amplifier]], [[radio]], [[CD player]], [[portable media player]], [[mobile phone]], [[video game console]], or [[electronic musical instrument]], either directly using a cord, or using [[wireless]] technology such as [[Bluetooth]], [[DECT]] or [[FM radio]].  The first headphones were developed in the late 19th century for use by [[Switchboard operator|telephone operators]], to keep their hands free. Initially the audio quality was mediocre and a step forward was the invention of [[Hi fi|high fidelity]] headphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stereocompare.com/headphones-buying-guide/#Hi%2520fidelity%2520headphones|title=Headphones : The Ultimate buying guide - Hi-fidelity headphones|website=StereoCompare|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307135117/http://www.stereocompare.com/headphones-buying-guide/#Hi%2520fidelity%2520headphones|archivedate=2016-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Headphones are made in a range of different audio reproduction quality capabilities.  Headsets designed for telephone use typically cannot reproduce sound with the [[high fidelity]] of expensive units designed for music listening by [[audiophile]]s.   Headphones that use cables typically have either a 1/4 inch (6.35mm) or 1/8 inch (3.5mm) [[phone connector (audio)|phone jack]] for plugging the headphones into the audio source. Some stereo earbuds are wireless, using [[Bluetooth]] connectivity to transmit the audio signal by radio waves from source devices like cellphones and digital players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3055208/its-true-apple-will-drop-the-headphone-jack-to-make-the-iphone-7-slimmer-and-simpler |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829052849/http://www.fastcompany.com/3055208/its-true-apple-will-drop-the-headphone-jack-to-make-the-iphone-7-slimmer-and-simpler |archivedate=2016-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Due to the spread of wireless devices in recent years headphones are increasingly used by people in public places such as sidewalks, grocery stores, and public transit.  Headphones are also used by people in various professional contexts, such as [[audio engineer]]s mixing sound for live concerts or [[sound recording]]s and [[DJ]]s, who use headphones to [[cue (audio)|cue]] up the next song without the audience hearing, aircraft pilots and [[call center]] employees. The latter two types of employees use headphones with an integrated microphone.

=={{anchor|history}}History==
[[Image:Brandes Superior Matched Tone c. 1919-21.jpg|thumb|right|Brandes radio headphones, circa 1920]]
Headphones originated from the telephone receiver earpiece, and were the only way to listen to electrical [[audio signal]]s before amplifiers were developed. The first truly successful set was developed in 1910 by [[Nathaniel Baldwin]], who made them by hand in his kitchen and sold them to the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112064674325;view=1up;seq=181|title=Howeth: Chapter XI|date=1963|work=|accessdate=5 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://historytogo.utah.gov/salt_lake_tribune/history_matters/070801.html Utah History To Go. ''Ruin Followed Riches for a Utah Genius'' (Will Bagley for the Salt Lake Tribune, July 8, 2001)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911070726/http://www.historytogo.utah.gov/salt_lake_tribune/history_matters/070801.html |date=September 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These early headphones used [[Moving iron speaker|moving iron drivers]],&lt;ref name="hearthis"/&gt; with either single-ended or balanced armatures.  The common single-ended type used voice coils wound around the poles of a permanent magnet, which were positioned close to a flexible steel diaphragm.  The audio current through the coils varied the magnetic field of the magnet, exerting a varying force on the diaphragm, causing it to vibrate, creating sound waves.  The requirement for high sensitivity meant that no damping was used, so the frequency response of the diaphragm had large peaks due to resonance, resulting in poor [[sound quality]]. These early models lacked padding, and were often uncomfortable to wear for long periods. Their [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] varied; headphones used in [[telegraph]] and telephone work had an impedance of 75&amp;nbsp;[[ohm]]s. Those used with early wireless radio had more turns of finer wire to increase sensitivity. Impedance of 1000 to 2000&amp;nbsp;ohms was common, which suited both crystal sets and [[triode]] receivers.  Some very sensitive headphones, such as those manufactured by Brandes around 1919, were commonly used for early radio work.

In early powered radios, the headphone was part of the [[vacuum tube]]'s [[Plate electrode|plate]] circuit and carried dangerous voltages. It was normally connected directly to the positive high voltage battery terminal, and the other battery terminal was securely grounded. The use of bare electrical connections meant that users could be shocked if they touched the bare headphone connections while adjusting an uncomfortable headset.

In 1958, [[John C. Koss]], an [[audiophile]] and [[jazz musician]] from [[Milwaukee]], produced the first stereo headphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Founded 1958 - World's First SP/3 Stereophone|url=https://www.koss.com/history/|website=koss.com|accessdate=13 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913183148/https://www.koss.com/history/|archivedate=13 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hearthis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Now hear this: the history of headphones|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/30/history-of-headphones|last=Smith|first=Caspar|publisher=The Guardian|date=30 October 2011|accessdate=13 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913182953/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/30/history-of-headphones|archivedate=13 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, headphones were used only by the US navy, telephone and radio operators, and individuals in similar industries.&lt;ref name="hearthis"/&gt;

Smaller earbud type earpieces, which plugged into the user's ear canal, were first developed for [[hearing aids]]. They became widely used with [[transistor radio]]s, which commercially appeared in 1954 with the introduction of the [[Regency TR-1]]. The most popular audio device in history, the transistor radio changed listening habits, allowing people to listen to radio anywhere.  The earbud uses either a moving iron driver or a [[crystal earpiece|piezoelectric crystal]] to produce sound.  The 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm radio and [[Phone connector (audio)|phone connector]], which is the most commonly used in portable application today, has been used at least since the Sony EFM-117J transistor radio, which was released in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sony history 1960s|url=http://www.sony.net/Fun/design/history/1960.html|website=Sony official website|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205195855/http://www.sony.net/Fun/design/history/1960.html|archivedate=2016-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Description of 3.5mm earphone jack in described model: &lt;br&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/vintage-sony-1960-efm-117j-radio-47603127|title=Vintage Sony 1960’S EFM-117J Radio|website=[[WorthPoint]]|accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity was reinforced with its use on the [[Walkman]] portable tape player in 1979.

== Applications ==
Headphones may be used with stationary [[Compact disc player|CD]] and [[DVD player]]s, [[home cinema|home theater]], [[personal computer]]s, or portable devices (e.g., [[digital audio player]]/[[MP3 player]], [[mobile phone]]). [[Cordless]] headphones are not connected to their source by a cable. Instead, they receive a [[radio]] or [[infrared]] signal encoded using a radio or infrared transmission link, such as [[frequency modulation|FM]], [[Bluetooth]] or [[Wi-Fi]]. These are powered receiver systems, of which the headphone is only a component. Cordless headphones are used with events such as a [[Silent disco]] or [[Silent Gig]].
[[File:Headphones-Sennheiser-HD555.jpg|thumb|[[Sennheiser]] HD 555 headphones, used in [[Audio Production|audio production]] environments (2007)]]
In the [[professional audio]] sector, headphones are used in live situations by [[disc jockey]]s with a [[DJ mixer]], and [[sound engineer]]s for monitoring signal sources. In radio studios, [[DJ]]s use a pair of headphones when talking to the microphone while the speakers are turned off to eliminate [[acoustic feedback]] while monitoring their own voice. In studio recordings, musicians and singers use headphones to play or sing along to a backing track or band. In military applications, audio signals of many varieties are monitored using headphones.

Wired headphones are attached to an audio source by a cable. The most common connectors are 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm (¼″) and 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm [[Phone connector (audio)|phone connectors]]. The larger 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm connector is more common on fixed location home or professional equipment. The 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm connector remains the most widely used connector for portable application today. Adapters are available for converting between 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm and 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm devices.

== Electrical characteristics ==
[[Electrical characteristics of dynamic loudspeakers]] may be readily applied to headphones, because most headphones are small dynamic loudspeakers.

=== Impedance ===
Headphones are available with low or high [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] (typically measured at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz). Low-impedance headphones are in the range 16 to 32&amp;nbsp;ohms and high-impedance headphones are about 100-600&amp;nbsp;ohms. As the impedance of a pair of headphones increases, more voltage (at a given current) is required to drive it, and the loudness of the headphones for a given voltage decreases. In recent years, impedance of newer headphones has generally decreased to accommodate lower voltages available on battery powered [[CMOS]]-based portable electronics. This has resulted in headphones that can be more efficiently driven by battery-powered electronics. Consequently, newer amplifiers are based on designs with relatively low output impedance.

The impedance of headphones is of concern because of the output limitations of amplifiers. A modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier, with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger load. Amplifiers are not ideal; they also have some output impedance that limits the amount of power they can provide. To ensure an even frequency response, adequate [[damping factor]], and undistorted sound, an amplifier should have an output impedance less than 1/8 that of the headphones it is driving (and ideally, as low as possible). If output impedance is large compared to the impedance of the headphones, significantly higher distortion is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Siau |first=John |title=The "0-Ohm" Headphone Amplifier |url=http://www.benchmarkmedia.com/discuss/sites/default/files/Headphone-Amplifier-Performance-Part-2.pdf |accessdate=26 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210012625/http://www.benchmarkmedia.com/discuss/sites/default/files/Headphone-Amplifier-Performance-Part-2.pdf |archivedate=10 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, lower impedance headphones tend to be louder and more efficient, but also demand a more capable amplifier. Higher impedance headphones are more tolerant of amplifier limitations, but produce less volume for a given output level.

Historically, many headphones had relatively high impedance, often over 500&amp;nbsp;ohms so they could operate well with high-impedance [[Valve amplifier#Operation|tube amplifiers]]. In contrast, modern transistor amplifiers can have very low output impedance, enabling lower-impedance headphones. Unfortunately, this means that older audio amplifiers or stereos often produce poor-quality output on some modern, low-impedance headphones. In this case, an external [[headphone amplifier]] may be beneficial.

=== Sensitivity ===
Sensitivity is a measure of how effectively an earpiece converts an incoming electrical signal into an audible sound. It thus indicates how loud the headphones are for a given electrical drive level. It can be measured in [[decibel]]s of [[sound pressure]] level per milli[[watt]] (dB (SPL)/mW) or decibels of sound pressure level per [[volt]] (dB (SPL) / V).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gilmore2.chem.northwestern.edu/tech/dbohn1_tech.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608015203/http://gilmore2.chem.northwestern.edu/tech/dbohn1_tech.htm |archivedate=2011-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, both definitions are widely used, often interchangeably.  As the output voltage (but not power) of a headphone amplifier is essentially constant for most common headphones, dB/mW is often more useful if converted into dB/V using [[Ohm's law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{dB (SPL)}/\mathrm{V} = \mathrm{dB (SPL)}/\mathrm{mW} - 10 \cdot \log_{10}{\frac{\mathrm{Impedance}}{1000}}&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, online calculators can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Headphone Sensitivity &amp; Efficiency Calculator|url=http://www.jensign.com/S4/calc.html|accessdate=22 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115085636/http://www.jensign.com/S4/calc.html|archivedate=15 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the sensitivity per volt is known, the maximum volume for a pair of headphones can be easily calculated from the maximum amplifier output voltage.  For example, for a headphone with a sensitivity of 100&amp;nbsp;dB (SPL)/V, an amplifier with an output of 1 [[root mean square]] (RMS) [[voltage]] produces a maximum volume of 100&amp;nbsp;dB.

Pairing high sensitivity headphones with power amplifiers can produce dangerously high volumes and damage headphones.  The maximum [[sound pressure]] level is a matter of preference, with some sources recommending no higher than 110 to 120&amp;nbsp;dB.  In contrast, the American [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] recommends an average SPL of no more than 85&amp;nbsp;dB(A) to avoid long-term hearing loss, while the [[European Union]] standard EN 50332-1:2013 recommends that volumes above 85&amp;nbsp;dB(A) include a warning, with an absolute maximum volume (defined using 40–4000&amp;nbsp;Hz noise) of no more than 100&amp;nbsp;dB to avoid accidental hearing damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BS EN 50332 tests for headphones and earphones with portable music players|accessdate=22 November 2014|ref=http://www.isvr.co.uk/labtests/en50332.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using this standard, headphones with sensitivities of 90, 100 and 110&amp;nbsp;dB (SPL)/V should be driven by an amplifier capable of no more than 3.162, 1.0 and 0.3162 RMS volts at maximum volume setting, respectively to reduce the risk of hearing damage.

The sensitivity of headphones is usually between about 80 and 125&amp;nbsp;dB/mW and usually measured at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding Earphone/Headphone Specifications |url=http://shure.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2991/~/understanding-earphone-%2F-headphone-specifications |work=Shure Customer Help |publisher=Shure |accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Headphone size can affect the balance between fidelity and portability. Generally, headphone form factors can be divided into four separate categories: ''circumaural (over-ear)'', ''supra-aural (on-ear)'', ''earbud'' and ''in-ear''.

=== Circumaural ===
[[Image:Headphones 1.jpg|thumb|Circumaural headphones have large pads that surround the outer ear.]]
'''Circumaural headphones''' (sometimes called '''full size headphones''' or over-ear headphones) have circular or ellipsoid earpads that encompass the ears. Because these headphones completely surround the ear, circumaural headphones can be designed to fully seal against the head to attenuate external noise. Because of their size, circumaural headphones can be heavy and there are some sets that weigh over {{convert|500|g|lb|0}}. Ergonomic headband and earpad design is required to reduce discomfort resulting from weight. These are commonly used by drummers in recording.

=== Supra-aural ===
[[Image:GradoPrestige-HeadphoneArticle.jpg|thumb|A pair of supra-aural (on-ear) headphones]]
'''Supra-aural headphones''' or on-ear headphones have pads that press against the ears, rather than around them. They were commonly bundled with [[personal stereo]]s during the 1980s. This type of headphone generally tends to be smaller and lighter than circumaural headphones, resulting in less attenuation of outside noise. Supra-aural headphones can also lead to discomfort due to the pressure on the ear as compared to circumaural headphones that sit around the ear. Comfort may vary due to the earcup material.

=== Open or closed back ===
Both circumaural and supra-aural headphones can be further differentiated by the type of earcups:

'''Open-back''' headphones have the back of the earcups open. This leaks more sound out of the headphone and also lets more ambient sounds into the headphone, but gives a more natural or speaker-like sound, due to including sounds from the environment.

'''Closed-back''' (or sealed) styles have the back of the earcups closed. They usually block some of the ambient noise. Closed-back headphones usually can produce stronger low frequencies than open-back headphones.

'''Semi-open''' headphones, have a design that can be considered as a compromise between open-back headphones and closed-back headphones. Some{{Who|date=July 2015}} believe the term "semi-open" is purely there for marketing purposes. There is no exact definition for the term semi-open headphone. Where the open-back approach has hardly any measure to block sound at the outer side of the diaphragm and the closed-back approach really has a closed chamber at the outer side of the diaphragm, a semi-open headphone can have a chamber to partially block sound while letting some sound through via openings or vents.

==== In-ear headphones ====
{{Main article|In-ear monitor}}
[[Image:InEarMonitors.jpg|thumb|upright|In-ear monitors extend into the ear canal, providing isolation from outside noise.]]
In-ear headphones, also known as in-ear monitors (IEMs) or canalphones, are small headphones with similar portability to earbuds that are inserted in the [[ear canal]] itself. IEMs are higher-quality in-ear headphones and are used by [[audio engineer]]s and [[musician]]s as well as audiophiles.

The outer shells of in-ear headphones are made up of a variety of materials, such as plastic, [[aluminum]], ceramic and other metal alloys. Because in-ear headphones engage the ear canal, they can be prone to sliding out, and they block out much environmental noise. Lack of sound from the environment can be a problem when sound is a necessary cue for safety or other reasons, as when walking, driving, or riding near or in vehicular traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Headphones as a Driving Distraction|url=https://www.rospa.com/rospaweb/docs/advice-services/road-safety/drivers/headphones-as-a-driver-distraction.pdf|publisher=The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents|format=pdf|accessdate=14 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915023105/https://www.rospa.com/rospaweb/docs/advice-services/road-safety/drivers/headphones-as-a-driver-distraction.pdf|archivedate=15 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generic or custom-fitting ear canal plugs are made from [[silicone]] rubber, [[elastomer]], or foam. Custom in-ear headphones use castings of the ear canal to create custom-molded plugs that provide added comfort and noise isolation.&lt;ref name="timebuds" /&gt;

==== Mixed fitting pivoting earphones ====

This type combines advantages of earbuds and in-ear headphones – depending on the environment and requirements of the user, they provide passive noise reduction for quality mode (conversation or active music listening) or they give control over the sound environment around user in comfort mode (stand by or background voice/music listening).{{cn|date=August 2017}}

=== Headset ===
{{Main article|Headset (audio)}}
[[File:Plantronics headset.jpg|thumb|left|A typical example of a headset used for [[voice chat]]s]]

A headset is a headphone combined with a [[microphone]]. Headsets provide the equivalent functionality of a telephone handset with hands-free operation. Among applications for headsets, besides telephone use, are aviation, theatre or television studio intercom systems, and console or PC gaming. Headsets are made with either a single-earpiece (mono) or a double-earpiece (mono to both ears or stereo). The microphone arm of headsets is either an external microphone type where the microphone is held in front of the user's mouth, or a voicetube type where the microphone is housed in the earpiece and speech reaches it by means of a hollow tube.

==== Telephone headsets ====
[[File:Se bluetooth headset.jpg|thumb|[[Sony Ericsson]] Cordless bluetooth headset]]
Telephone headsets connect to a [[fixed-line]] telephone system. A telephone headset functions by replacing the [[handset]] of a telephone. Headsets for standard corded telephones are fitted with a standard [[4P4C]] commonly called an RJ-9 connector. Headsets are also available with 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm jack sockets for many DECT phones and other applications. Cordless [[bluetooth]] headsets are available, and often used with [[mobile telephone]]s. Headsets are widely used for telephone-intensive jobs, in particular by [[call centre]] workers. They are also used by anyone wishing to hold telephone conversations with both hands free.

For older models of telephones, the headset microphone [[electrical impedance|impedance]] is different from that of the original handset, requiring a telephone amplifier for the telephone headset. A telephone amplifier provides basic pin-alignment similar to a telephone headset adaptor, but it also offers sound [[amplifier|amplification]] for the microphone as well as the loudspeakers. Most models of telephone amplifiers offer volume control for loudspeaker as well as microphone, mute function and switching between headset and handset. Telephone amplifiers are powered by batteries or [[AC adaptor]]s.

== Ambient noise reduction ==
[[File:In-ears-earphones.png|thumb|left|In-ears are among those good for noise isolation]]

Unwanted sound from the environment can be reduced by excluding sound from the ear by passive noise isolation, or, often in conjunction with isolation, by active [[Noise-cancelling headphones|noise cancellation]].

Passive noise isolation is essentially using the body of the earphone, either over or in the ear, as a passive earplug that simply blocks out sound. The headphone types that provide most attenuation are in-ear canal headphones and closed-back headphones, both circumaural and supra aural. Open-back and earbud headphones provide some passive noise isolation, but much less than the others. Typical closed-back headphones block 8 to 12&amp;nbsp;dB, and in-ears anywhere from 10 to 15&amp;nbsp;dB. Some models have been specifically designed for drummers to facilitate the drummer monitoring the recorded sound while reducing sound directly from the drums as much as possible. Such headphones claim to reduce ambient noise by around 25&amp;nbsp;dB.

Active noise-cancelling headphones use a microphone, amplifier, and speaker to pick up, amplify, and play ambient noise in phase-reversed form; this to some extent cancels out unwanted noise from the environment without affecting the desired sound source, which is not picked up and reversed by the microphone. They require a power source, usually a battery, to drive their circuitry. Active noise cancelling headphones can attenuate ambient noise by 20&amp;nbsp;dB or more, but the active circuitry is mainly effective on constant sounds and at lower frequencies, rather than sharp sounds and voices. Some noise cancelling headphones are designed mainly to reduce low-frequency engine and travel noise in aircraft, trains, and automobiles, and are less effective in environments with other types of noise.

== Transducer technology ==
Headphones use various types of [[transducer]] to convert electrical signals to sound.

=== Moving-coil ===
[[Image:Headphone-transducer.jpg|thumb|right|A typical moving-coil headphone transducer]]
The [[Loudspeaker|moving coil driver]], more commonly referred to as a "dynamic" driver is the most common type used in headphones.  It consists of a stationary [[magnet]] element affixed to the frame of the headphone, which sets up a static magnetic field. The magnet in headphones is typically composed of [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] or [[Neodymium magnet|neodymium]].  A [[voice coil]], a light coil of wire, is suspended in the magnetic field of the magnet, attached to a diaphragm, typically fabricated from lightweight, high-stiffness-to-mass-ratio cellulose, polymer, carbon material, paper or the like.   When the varying current of an [[audio signal]] is passed through the coil, it creates a varying magnetic field that reacts against the static magnetic field, exerting a varying force on the coil causing it and the attached diaphragm to vibrate. The vibrating diaphragm pushes on the air to produce [[sound wave]]s.

=== Electrostatic ===
[[Image:Es spk.gif|thumb|right|Electrostatic loudspeaker diagram]]
Electrostatic drivers consist of a thin, electrically charged diaphragm, typically a coated [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] membrane, suspended between two perforated metal plates (electrodes). The electrical sound signal is applied to the electrodes creating an electrical field; depending on the polarity of this field, the diaphragm is drawn towards one of the plates. Air is forced through the perforations; combined with a continuously changing electrical signal driving the membrane, a sound wave is generated. Electrostatic headphones are usually more expensive than moving-coil ones, and are comparatively uncommon. In addition, a special amplifier is required to amplify the signal to deflect the membrane, which often requires electrical potentials in the range of 100 to 1000&amp;nbsp;volts.

Due to the extremely thin and light diaphragm membrane, often only a few micrometers thick, and the complete absence of moving metalwork, the frequency response of electrostatic headphones usually extends well above the audible limit of approximately 20&amp;nbsp;kHz. The high frequency response means that the low midband distortion level is maintained to the top of the audible frequency band, which is generally not the case with moving coil drivers. Also, the frequency response peakiness regularly seen in the high frequency region with moving coil drivers is absent. Well-designed electrostatic headphones can produce significantly better sound quality than other types.{{citation needed|reason=Such broad claims need sources|date=May 2015}}

Electrostatic headphones require a voltage source generating 100&amp;nbsp;V to over 1&amp;nbsp;kV, and are on the user's head. Since the invention of insulators, there's no actual danger. They do not need to deliver significant [[electric current]], which further limits the electrical hazard to the wearer in case of fault.

=== Electret ===
An [[electret]] driver functions along the same electromechanical means as an electrostatic driver. However the electret driver has a permanent charge built into it, whereas electrostatics have the charge applied to the driver by an external generator. Electret and electrostatic headphones are relatively uncommon. Original electrets were also typically cheaper and lower in technical capability and fidelity than electrostatics. Patent applications from 2009-2013 have been approved that show by using different materials, i.e. a "Fluorinated cyclic olefin electret film", Frequency response chart readings can reach 50&amp;nbsp;kHz  at 100db. When these new improved electrets are combined with a traditional dome headphone driver, headphones can be produced that are recognised by the Japan Audio Society as worthy of joining the Hi Res Audio program. US patents 8,559,660 B2. 7,732,547 B2.7,879,446 B2.7,498,699 B2.

===Orthodynamic===

Orthodynamic (also known as Planar Magnetic) headphones use similar technology to electrostatic headphones, with some fundamental differences. They operate similarly to [[Loudspeaker#Ribbon and planar magnetic loudspeakers|Planar Magnetic Loudspeakers]].

An orthodynamic driver consists of a relatively large membrane that contains an embedded wire pattern. This membrane is suspended between two sets of permanent, oppositely aligned, magnets.
A current passed through the wires embedded in the membrane produces a magnetic field that reacts with the field of the permanent magnets to induce movement in the membrane, which produces sound.

=== Balanced armature ===
[[Image:Bal Arm.JPG|thumb|left|Balanced armature transducer with armature balanced and exerting no force on diaphragm]]

A balanced armature is a sound transducer design primarily intended to increase the electrical efficiency of the element by eliminating the stress on the diaphragm characteristic of many other magnetic transducer systems. As shown schematically in the first diagram, it consists of a moving magnetic armature that is pivoted so it can move in the field of the permanent magnet. When precisely centered in the magnetic field there is no net force on the armature, hence the term 'balanced.' As illustrated in the second diagram, when there is [[electric current]] through the coil, it [[Electromagnet|magnetizes]] the armature one way or the other, causing it to rotate slightly one way or the other about the pivot thus moving the [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] to make [[sound]].

[[Image:JH16 Balanced Armatures.jpg|upright|thumb|A custom in-ear monitor which uses 8 balanced armatures in a triple crossover configuration (4 low/2 mid/2 high). Headphone designs often use multiple balanced armatures to provide a higher fidelity sound.]]
The design is not mechanically stable; a slight imbalance makes the armature stick to one pole of the magnet. A fairly stiff restoring force is required to hold the armature in the 'balance' position. Although this reduces its efficiency, this design can still produce more sound from less power than any other{{Clarify|date=January 2014|reason=isn't more sound from less power the definition of high efficiency?}}. Popularized in the 1920s as Baldwin Mica Diaphragm radio headphones, balanced armature transducers were refined during [[World War II]] for use in military [[sound powered telephone]]s. Some of these achieved astonishing electro-acoustic conversion efficiencies, in the range of 20% to 40%, for narrow bandwidth voice signals.

Today they are typically used only in in-ear headphones and hearing aids, where their high efficiency and diminutive size is a major advantage.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
They generally are limited at the extremes of the hearing spectrum (e.g. below 20&amp;nbsp;Hz and above 16&amp;nbsp;kHz) and require a better seal than other types of drivers to deliver their full potential. Higher-end models may employ multiple armature drivers, dividing the frequency ranges between them using a passive crossover network. A few combine an armature driver with a small moving-coil driver for increased bass output.

The earliest loudspeakers for radio receivers used balanced armature drivers for their cones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5IMSAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=earliest+loudspeakers+used+balanced+armature+drivers+for+their+cones.&amp;dq=earliest+loudspeakers+used+balanced+armature+drivers+for+their+cones.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmp-GsiOTXAhWhwFQKHV8fD80Q6AEILjAB|title=A History of Engineering and Science in the Bell System: The early years (1875-1925)|last=Joel|first=Amos E.|last2=Laboratories|first2=Bell Telephone|last3=Schindler|first3=G. E.|date=1975|publisher=The Laboratories|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thermoacoustic technology ===
The thermoacoustic effect generates sound from the audio frequency Joule heating of the conductor, an effect that is not magnetic and does not vibrate the speaker.
In 2013 a carbon nanotube thin-yarn earphone based on the thermoacoustic mechanism was demonstrated by a research group in Tsinghua University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yang Wei |author2=Xiaoyang Lin |author3=Kaili Jiang |author4=Peng Liu |author5=Qunqing Li |author6=Shoushan Fan |title=Thermoacoustic Chips with Carbon Nanotube Thin Yarn Arrays. |journal=Nano Letters |year=2013 |doi=10.1021/nl402408j |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nl402408j |pmid=24041369 |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=4795–801}}&lt;/ref&gt; The as-produced CNT thin yarn earphone has a working element called CNT thin yarn thermoacoustic chip. Such a chip is composed of a layer of CNT thin yarn array supported by the silicon wafer, and periodic grooves with certain depth are made on the wafer by micro-fabrication methods to suppress the heat leakage from the CNT yarn to the substrate.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== Other transducer technologies ===
Transducer technologies employed much less commonly for headphones include the [[Oskar Heil|Heil]] [[Air Motion Transformer]] (AMT); Piezoelectric film; Ribbon planar magnetic; Magnetostriction and [[Plasma speaker|Plasma-ionisation]]. The first [[Air Motion Transformer|Heil AMT]] headphone was marketed by [[ESS Laboratories]] and was essentially an ESS AMT tweeter from one of the company's speakers being driven at full range. Since the turn of the century, only [[Precide]] of Switzerland have manufactured an AMT headphone. Piezoelectric film headphones were first developed by Pioneer, their two models used a flat sheet of film that limited the maximum volume of air movement. Currently, TakeT produces a piezoelectric film headphone shaped similarly to an AMT transducer but, which like the Precide driver, has a variation in the size of transducer folds over the diaphragm. It additionally incorporates a two way design by its inclusion of a dedicated tweeter/supertweeter panel. The folded shape of a diaphragm allows a transducer with a larger surface area to fit within smaller space constraints. This increases the total volume of air that can be moved on each excursion of the transducer given that radiating area.

[[Magnetostriction]] headphones, sometimes sold under the label ''Bonephones'', work by vibrating against the side of head, transmitting sound via [[bone conduction]]. This is particularly helpful in situations where the ears must be unobstructed, or for people who are [[deaf]] for reasons that don't affect the nervous apparatus of [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. Magnetostriction headphones though, are limited in their fidelity compared to conventional headphones that rely on the normal workings of the ear. Additionally, in the early 1990s, a French company called Plasmasonics tried to market a plasma-ionisation headphone. There are no known functioning examples left.

== Benefits and limitations ==
[[Image:Sony MDR-V6 headphones.jpg|thumb|Two [[Sony MDR-V6]] headphones, one folded for travel]]
Headphones can prevent other people from hearing the sound, either for [[privacy]] or to prevent disturbing others, as in listening in a public [[library]]. They can also provide a level of sound fidelity greater than loudspeakers of similar cost. Part of their ability to do so comes from the lack of any need to perform room correction treatments with headphones. High-quality headphones can have an extremely flat low-frequency response down to 20&amp;nbsp;Hz within 3&amp;nbsp;dB. While a loudspeaker must use a relatively large (often 15" or 18") [[speaker driver]] to reproduce low frequencies, headphones can accurately reproduce bass and sub-bass frequencies with speaker drivers only 40-50 millimeters wide (or much smaller, as is the case with [[in-ear monitor]] headphones). Headphones' impressive low-frequency performance is possible because they are so much closer to the ear that they only need to move relatively small volumes of air.

Marketed claims such as 'frequency response 4&amp;nbsp;Hz to 20&amp;nbsp;kHz' are usually overstatements; the product's response at frequencies lower than 20&amp;nbsp;Hz is typically very small.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7612_7-6322607-4.html cnet reviews: Headphone Buying Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820010315/http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7612_7-6322607-4.html |date=2011-08-20 }} "Even the flimsiest, cheap headphones routinely boast extremely low bass-response performance—15 or 20Hz—but almost always sound lightweight and bright."&lt;/ref&gt; 
Headphones are also useful for [[video game]]s that use 3D positional audio processing algorithms, as they allow players to better judge the position of an off-screen sound source (such as the footsteps of an opponent or their gun fire).

Although modern headphones have been particularly widely sold and used for listening to [[Stereophonic sound|stereo recordings]] since the release of the [[Walkman]], there is subjective debate regarding the nature of their reproduction of stereo sound. Stereo recordings represent the position of horizontal depth cues (stereo separation) via volume and phase differences of the sound in question between the two channels. When the sounds from two speakers mix, they create the [[phase (waves)|phase]] difference the brain uses to locate direction. Through most headphones, because the right and left channels do not combine in this manner, the illusion of the phantom center can be perceived as lost. Hard [[Panning (audio)|panned]] sounds are also heard only in one ear rather than from one side.

[[Binaural recording]]s use a different microphone technique to encode direction directly as phase, with very little amplitude difference below 2&amp;nbsp;kHz, often using a [[dummy head recording|dummy head]]. They can produce a surprisingly lifelike spatial impression through headphones. Commercial recordings almost always use stereo recording, rather than binaural, because loudspeaker listening is more common than headphone listening.

It is possible to change the spatial effects of stereo sound on headphones, to better approximate the presentation of speaker reproduction, by using frequency-dependent cross-feed between the channels.

Headsets can have [[ergonomic]] benefits over traditional telephone handsets. They allow [[call centre|call center]] agents to maintain better [[human position|posture]] without needing to hand-hold a [[transceiver#Telephony|handset]] or tilt their head sideways to cradle it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/computerworkstations/checklist.html United States Department of Labor.

Using headphones at a sufficiently high [[volume]] level may cause temporary or permanent [[hearing impairment]] or [[deafness]].

Motorcycle and other power-sport riders benefit by wearing foam earplugs when legal to do so to avoid excessive road, engine, and wind noise, but their ability to hear music and [[intercom]] speech is actually enhanced when doing so. The ear can normally detect 1-billionth of an atmosphere of sound pressure level,&lt;ref&gt;A standard [[threshold of hearing]] at 1000&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] for the human ear is 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] ({{cite web |last=Marsh |first=Andrew |title=Human Ear and Hearing |url=http://www.kemt.fei.tuke.sk/Predmety/KEMT320_EA/_web/Online_Course_on_Acoustics/hearing.html |work=Online Course on Acoustics |publisher=The School of Architecture and Fine Arts, The University of Western Australia |accessdate=23 August 2010 |year=1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721180215/http://www.kemt.fei.tuke.sk/Predmety/KEMT320_EA/_web/Online_Course_on_Acoustics/hearing.html |archivedate=21 July 2010 |df= }}); Standard [[atmospheric pressure]] is 101,325&amp;nbsp;Pa. 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; / 100,000 = 0.2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;, a ratio of less than a billionth.&lt;/ref&gt; hence it is incredibly sensitive. At very high sound pressure levels, muscles in the ear tighten the tympanic membrane and this leads to a small change in the geometry of the ossicles and stirrup that results in lower transfer of force to the oval window of the inner ear (the [[acoustic reflex]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/sound/protect.html#c1|title=The Ear's Protective Mechanisms|work=gsu.edu|accessdate=21 July 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503013758/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/sound/protect.html#c1|archivedate=3 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The risk of hearing damage also depends on the exposure time. The higher the volume, the faster hearing loss occurs. According to [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] work safety guidelines, workers should be exposed to 90dBA noise for a maximum of 8 hours to avoid hearing loss. An increase to just 95dBA cuts the safe exposure to only 4 hours. But there is little specific consensus on the safe level of exposure. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] has an 8-hour recommended exposure limit set to 85dBA. Additionally, an increase to 93dBA instead of 95dBA halves the safe exposure time to 4 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/laboratory/OSHAfactsheet-laboratory-safety-noise.pdf|title=OSHA Fact Sheet Laboratory Safety Noise|last=|first=|date=|website=OSHA.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829231722/https://www.osha.gov/Publications/laboratory/OSHAfactsheet-laboratory-safety-noise.pdf|archive-date=2017-08-29|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have found that people are more likely to raise volumes to unsafe levels while performing strenuous exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Can Loud Noise during Exercise Damage my Hearing?|url=http://www.healthyhearing.com/content/faqs/Hearing-loss/Causes/31070-Loud-noise-during-exercise|website=Healthy Hearing|accessdate=8 November 2014|location=Item 4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109002409/http://www.healthyhearing.com/content/faqs/Hearing-loss/Causes/31070-Loud-noise-during-exercise|archivedate=9 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Finnish study&lt;ref&gt;Airo, Erkko; J.

(1996)&lt;/ref&gt; recommended that exercisers should set their headphone volumes to half of their normal loudness and only use them for half an hour.

Noise cancelling headphones can be considered dangerous because of a lack of awareness the listener may have with their environment. Noise cancelling headphones are so effective that a person may not be able to hear oncoming traffic or pay attention to people around them. There is also a general danger that music in headphones can distract the listener and lead to dangerous situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/w_DietAndFitnessNews/deaf-danger-perils-earbuds-exercising/story?id=13925714#.UcMJhufVDoI |title=Deaf to Danger: The Perils of Earbuds |last1=Greenfield |first1=Paige |date=25 June 2011 |website=ABC News |accessdate=20 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214122323/http://abcnews.go.com/Health/w_DietAndFitnessNews/deaf-danger-perils-earbuds-exercising/story?id=13925714#.UcMJhufVDoI |archivedate=14 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usual way of limiting sound volume on devices driving headphones is by limiting output power. This has the additional undesirable effect of being dependent of the efficiency of the headphones; a device producing the maximum allowed power may not produce adequate volume when paired with low-efficiency, high-impedance equipment, while the same amount of power can reach dangerous levels with very efficient earphones.

The ways in which societies have perceived the [[concept]] of [[creativity]] have changed throughout history, as has the [[terminology|term]] itself.  The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] concept of art (in Greek, "''techne''" — the root of "technique" and "technology"), with the exception of poetry, involved not freedom of action but subjection to ''rules''.  In [[ancient Rome|Rome]], the Greek concept was partly shaken, and [[visual art]]ists were viewed as sharing, with poets, [[imagination]] and [[artistic inspiration|inspiration]].

Under [[medieval]] [[Christianity]], the [[Latin]] "''creatio''" came to designate [[God]]'s act of "''[[creatio ex nihilo]]''" ("creation from nothing"); thus "''creatio''" ceased to apply to human activities.  The Middle Ages, however, went even further than antiquity, when they revoked poetry's exceptional status:  it, too, was an art and therefore craft and not creativity.

[[Renaissance]] men sought to give voice to their sense of their freedom and creativity.  The first to apply the word "creativity," however, was the 17th-century Polish poet [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] — but he applied it only to poetry.  For over a century and a half, the idea of ''human'' creativity met with resistance, because the term "creation" was reserved for creation "from nothing."

In the 19th century, art took its revenge:  now not only was art recognized as creativity, but ''it alone'' was.  When later, at the turn of the 20th century, there began to be discussion as well of creativity in the [[sciences]] and in [[nature]], this was taken as the transference, to the sciences and to nature, of concepts that were proper to art.

==Term and concept==
[[File:Head Platon Glyptothek Munich 548.jpg|thumb|85px|[[Plato]]]]
The [[ancient Greeks]] had no terms corresponding to "to create" or "creator."  The expression "''poiein''" ("to make") sufficed.  And even that was not extended to art in general, but only to ''poiesis'' (poetry) and to the ''poietes'' (poet, or "maker") who ''made'' it.  [[Plato]] asks in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?" and answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."  To the ancient Greeks, the concept of a creator and of creativity implied freedom of action, whereas the Greeks' concept of art involved subjection to laws and rules.  Art (in Greek, "''techne''") was "the making of things, according to rules."  It contained no creativity, and it would have been — in the Greeks' view — a bad state of affairs if it ''had''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''A History of Six Ideas:  an Essay in Aesthetics'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

This understanding of art had a distinct premise:  [[Nature]] is [[perfection|perfect]] and is subject to laws, therefore man ought to discover its laws and submit to them, and not seek freedom, which will deflect him from that ''optimum'' which he can attain.  The artist was a [[discovery (observation)|discoverer]], not an [[inventor]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 245"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sole exception to this Greek view — a ''great'' exception — was poetry.  The poet made new things — brought to life a new world — while the artist merely ''imitated''.  And the poet, unlike the artist, was ''not'' bound by laws.  There were no terms corresponding to "creativity" or "creator," but in reality the poet was understood to be one who creates.  And only he was so understood.  In music, there was no freedom:  melodies were prescribed, particularly for ceremonies and entertainments, and were known tellingly as "''nomoi''" ("laws").  In the [[visual arts]], freedom was limited by the [[Body proportions|proportions]] that [[Polyclitus (sculptor)|Polyclitus]] had established for the human frame, and which he called "the canon" (meaning, "measure").  [[Plato]] argued in ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' that, to execute a good work, one must contemplate an eternal model.  Later the [[Roman Republic|Roman]], [[Cicero]], would write that art embraces those things "of which we have knowledge" ("''quae sciuntur''").&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 245"/&gt;

Poets saw things differently.  Book I of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' asks, "Why forbid the singer to please us with singing ''as he himself will?''"  [[Aristotle]] had doubts as to whether poetry was imitation of reality, and as to whether it required adherence to truth:  it was, rather, the realm of that "which is neither true nor false."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 245–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome, these Greek concepts were partly shaken.  [[Horace]] wrote that not only poets but painters as well were entitled to the privilege of daring whatever they wished to ("''quod libet audendi''").  In the declining period of antiquity, [[Philostratus]] wrote that "one can discover a similarity between poetry and art and find that they have [[imagination]] in common."  [[Callistratos]] averred that "Not only is the art of the poets and [[prose|prosaist]]s inspired, but likewise the hands of [[sculptor]]s are gifted with the blessing of divine [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]]."  This was something new:  [[classical Greece|classical Greeks]] had not applied the [[concept]]s of [[imagination]] and inspiration to the [[visual arts]] but had restricted them to poetry.  [[Latin]] was richer than Greek:  it had a term for "creating" ("''creatio''") and for "''creator''," and had ''two'' expressions — "''facere''" and "''creare''" — where Greek had but one, "''poiein''."  Still, the two Latin terms meant much the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fundamental change, however, came in the Christian period:  "''creatio''" came to designate [[God]]'s act of "creation from nothing" ("''creatio ex nihilo''").  "''Creatio''" thus took on a different meaning than "''facere''" ("to make"), and ceased to apply to human functions.  As the 6th-century Roman official and literary figure [[Cassiodorus]] wrote, "things made and created differ, for we can make, who cannot create."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 247"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside this new, [[religion|religious]] interpretation of the expression, there persisted the ancient view that art is not a domain of creativity. This is seen in two early and influential Christian writers, [[Pseudo-Dionysius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]. Later [[medieval]] men such as [[Hraban the Moor]], and [[Robert Grosseteste]] in the 13th century, thought much the same way.  The [[Middle Ages]] here went even further than [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]; they made no exception of poetry:  it too had its rules, was an art, and was therefore [[craft]] and not creativity.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 247"/&gt;

All this changed in modern times.  [[Renaissance]] men had a sense of their own independence, freedom and creativity, and sought to give voice to this sense of independence and creativity.  The philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] wrote that the artist "thinks up" ("''excogitatio''") his works; the theoretician of architecture and painting, [[Leon Battista Alberti]], that he "preordains" ("''preordinazione''"); [[Raphael]], that he shapes a painting according to his idea; [[Leonardo da Vinci]], that he employs "shapes that do not exist in nature"; [[Michelangelo]], that the artist realizes his vision rather than imitating nature; [[Giorgio Vasari]], that "nature is conquered by art"; the Venetian art theoretician, [[Paolo Pino]], that painting is "inventing what is not"; [[Paolo Veronese]], that painters avail themselves of the same liberties as do poets and madmen; [[Federico Zuccari]] (1542–1609), that the artist shapes "a new world, new paradises"; [[Cesare Cesariano]] (1483–1541), that architects are "demi-gods."  Among musicians, the [[Flanders|Flemish]] composer and musicologist [[Johannes Tinctoris]] (1446–1511) demanded novelty in what a composer did, and defined a composer as "one who produces ''new'' songs."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 247–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still more emphatic were those who wrote about poetry:  [[G.P. Capriano]] held (1555) that the poet's invention springs "from nothing."  [[Francesco Patrizi]] (1586) saw poetry as "fiction," "shaping," "transformation."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 248"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, at long last, someone ventured to use the word, "creation."  He was the 17th-century Polish poet and theoretician of poetry, [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] (1595–1640), known as "the last Latin poet."  In his treatise, ''De perfecta poesi'', he not only wrote that a poet "invents," "after a fashion builds," but also that the poet "''creates anew''" ("''de novo creat''").  Sarbiewski even added:  "in the manner of God" ("''instar Dei''").&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 248"/&gt;

Sarbiewski, however, regarded creativity as the exclusive privilege of poetry; creativity was not open to visual artists.  "Other arts merely imitate and copy but do not create, because they assume the existence of the material from which they create or of the subject."  As late as the end of the 17th century, [[André Félibien]] (1619–75) would write that the painter is "so to speak [a] creator."  The Spanish [[Jesuit]] [[Baltasar Gracián]] (1601–58) wrote similarly as Sarbiewski:  "Art is the completion of nature, as it were ''a second Creator''..."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 248"/&gt;

By the 18th century, the concept of creativity was appearing more often in art theory.  It was linked with the concept of [[imagination]], which was on all lips. [[Joseph Addison]] wrote that the imagination "has something in it like creation."  [[Voltaire]] declared (1740) that "the true poet is creative."  With both these authors, however, this was rather only a ''comparison'' of poet with creator.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 248–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers took a different view.  [[Denis Diderot]] felt that imagination is merely "the memory of forms and contents," and "creates nothing" but only combines, magnifies or diminishes.  It was precisely in 18th-century France, indeed, that the idea of man's creativity met with resistance.  [[Charles Batteux]] wrote that "The human mind ''cannot create'', strictly speaking; all its products bear the stigmata of their model; even monsters invented by an imagination unhampered by laws can only be composed of parts taken from nature."  [[Luc de Clapiers, marquis de Vauvenargues]] (1715–47), and [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]] (1715–80) spoke to a similar effect.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 249"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their resistance to the idea of human creativity had a triple source.  The expression, "creation," was then reserved for creation ''ex nihilo'' ({{lang-la|from nothing}}), which was inaccessible to man.  Second, creation is a mysterious act, and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] psychology did not admit of mysteries.  Third, artists of the age were attached to their rules, and creativity seemed irreconcilable with rules.  The latter objection was the weakest, as it was already beginning to be realized (e.g., by [[Houdar de la Motte]], 1715) that rules ultimately are a ''human invention''.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 249"/&gt;

In the 19th century, art took its compensation for the resistance of preceding centuries against recognizing it as creativity.  Now not only was art regarded as creativity, but ''it alone'' was so regarded. When later, at the turn of the 20th century, there began to be discussion as well of creativity in the [[science]]s (e.g., [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], 1878–1956) and in [[nature]] (e.g., [[Henri Bergson]]), this was generally taken as the transference, to the sciences and to nature, of concepts proper to art.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 249"/&gt;

The start of the ''scientific'' study of creativity is sometimes taken as [[J. P. Guilford]]'s 1950 address to the [[American Psychological Association]], which helped popularize the subject.&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cocreativity.com/handouts/guilford.pdf | title=Guilford's structure of the intellect | publisher=The Co-Creativity Institute | accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other students of creativity have taken a more pragmatic approach, teaching practical [[creativity techniques]]. Three of the best-known are [[Alex Osborn]]'s "[[brainstorming]]" (1950s to present), [[Genrikh Altshuller]]'s Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving ([[TRIZ]], 1950s to present), and [[Edward de Bono]]'s "[[lateral thinking]]" (1960s to present).

[[Image:Gradient2.svg|thumb|300px|Two types of gradients, with blue arrows to indicate the direction of the gradient. Dark areas indicate higher values]]
[[File:Blue-green-gradient.jpg|thumb|300x300px|A blue and green [[color gradient]].]]
An '''image gradient''' is a directional change in the intensity or color in an image. The gradient of the image is one of the fundamental building blocks in [[image processing]]. For example, the [[Canny edge detector]] uses image gradient for [[edge detection]]. In [[graphics software]] for [[digital image editing]], the term gradient or [[color gradient]] is also used for a gradual blend of [[color]] which can be considered as an even [[wiktionary:gradation|gradation]] from low to high values, as used from white to black in the images to the right. Another name for this is ''color progression''.

Mathematically, the [[gradient]] of a two-variable function (here the image intensity function) at each image point is a 2D [[vector (geometric)|vector]] with the components given by the [[derivative]]s in the horizontal and vertical directions. At each image point, the gradient vector points in the direction of largest possible intensity increase, and the length of the gradient vector corresponds to the rate of change in that direction.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, David. "Image gradients." Class Notes for CMSC 426 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the intensity function of a digital image is only known at discrete points, derivatives of this function cannot be defined unless we assume that there is an underlying [[continuous function|continuous]] intensity function which has been sampled at the image points. With some additional assumptions, the derivative of the continuous intensity function can be computed as a function on the sampled intensity function, i.e., the digital image. Approximations of these derivative functions can be defined at varying degrees of accuracy. The most common way to approximate the image gradient is to [[convolution|convolve]] an image with a kernel, such as the [[Sobel operator]] or [[Prewitt operator]].

Image gradients are often utilized in [[map]]s and other visual representations of [[data]] in order to convey additional information. [[Geographic information system|GIS]] tools use color progressions to indicate [[elevation]] and [[population density]], among others.

== Computer vision ==
{{main|Computer vision}}
[[File:Intensity image with gradient images.png|thumb|400px|alt=Left: Black and white picture of a cat. Center: The same cat, displayed in a gradient image in the x direction. Appears similar to an embossed image. Right: The same cat, displayed in a gradient image in the y direction. Appears similar to an embossed image.|On the left, an intensity image of a cat. In the center, a gradient image in the x direction measuring horizontal change in intensity. On the right, a gradient image in the y direction measuring vertical change in intensity. Gray pixels have a small gradient; black or white pixels have a large gradient.]]

Image gradients can be used to extract information from images. Gradient images are created from the original image (generally by convolving with a filter, one of  the simplest being the [[Sobel filter]]) for this purpose. Each pixel of a gradient image measures the change in intensity of that same point in the original image, in a given direction. To get the full range of direction, gradient images in the x and y directions are computed.

One of the most common uses is in edge detection. After gradient images have been computed, pixels with large gradient values become possible edge pixels. The pixels with the largest gradient values in the direction of the gradient become edge pixels, and edges may be traced in the direction perpendicular to the gradient direction. One example of an edge detection algorithm that uses gradients is the [[Canny edge detector]].

Image gradients can also be used for robust feature and texture matching. Different lighting or camera properties can cause two images of the same scene to have drastically different pixel values. This can cause matching algorithms to fail to match very similar or identical features. One way to solve this is to compute texture or feature signatures based on gradient images computed from the original images. These gradients are less susceptible to lighting and camera changes, so matching errors are reduced.

== Math ==
The gradient of an image is a vector of its [[partial derivative|partials]]:&lt;ref name=dip3&gt;{{cite book |last=Gonzalez |first=Rafael |author2=Richard Woods |title=Digital Image Processing |url=http://www.imageprocessingplace.com/DIP-3E/dip3e_main_page.htm |edition=3rd |publisher=Pearson Education, Inc. |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-13-168728-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|165}}

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f=\begin{bmatrix}
g_{x} \\
g_{y}
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;,

where:

:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt; is the derivative with respect to x (gradient in the x direction)

:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}&lt;/math&gt; is the derivative with respect to y (gradient in the y direction).

The [[derivative]] of an image can be approximated by [[finite differences]]. If central difference is used, to calculate &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}&lt;/math&gt; we can apply a 1-dimensional filter to the image &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; by [[Kernel (image processing)#Convolution|convolution]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \begin{bmatrix} 
-1 \\
+1 
\end{bmatrix} * \mathbf{A}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; denotes the 1-dimensional convolution operation. This 2&amp;times;1 filter will shift the image by half a pixel. To avoid this, the following 3&amp;times;1 filter
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} 
-1 \\
0 \\
+1 
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
can be used. The gradient direction can be calculated by the formula:&lt;ref name=dip3 /&gt;{{rp|706}}

:&lt;math&gt;\theta =  \operatorname{tan{^-}{^1}} \left [ \frac{g_{y}}{g_{x}} \right ]&lt;/math&gt;,

'''Intercropping''' is a multiple cropping practice involving growing two or more [[crop]]s in proximity. The most common goal of  intercropping is to produce a greater yield on a given piece of land by making use of resources or ecological processes that would otherwise not be utilized by a single [[crop]].&lt;ref name="sustainable horticulture"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://scihub.org/ABJNA/PDF/2010/5/ABJNA-1-5-1098-1105.pdf |title=Sustainable horticultural crop production through intercropping: The case of fruits and vegetable crops: A review |last=Ouma |first=George |last2=Jeruto |first2=P |journal=Agriculture and Biology Journal of North America |year=2010 |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=1098–1105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential benefits ==

=== Resource partitioning ===
{{further|Resource partitioning}}

Careful planning is required, taking into account the [[soil]], [[climate]], crops, and [[variety (botany)|varieties]]. It is particularly important not to have crops competing with each other for physical space, [[nutrient]]s, [[water]], or [[sunlight]]. Examples of intercropping strategies are planting a deep-[[root]]ed crop with a shallow-rooted crop, or planting a tall crop with a shorter crop that requires partial shade. [[Inga alley cropping]] has been proposed as an alternative to the ecological destruction of [[slash-and-burn farming]].&lt;ref name="Elkan"&gt;Elkan, Daniel. ''Slash-and-burn farming has become a major threat to the world's rainforest'' [[The Guardian]] 21 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

When crops are carefully selected, other agronomic benefits are also achieved.

=== Mutualism ===&lt;!--do not link to Mutualism (biology), that's something else entirely--&gt;

Planting two crops in close proximity can especially be beneficial when the two plants interact in a way that increases one or both of the plant's [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] (and therefore yield). For example, plants that are prone to tip over in wind or heavy rain (lodging-prone plants), may be given structural support by their companion crop.&lt;ref&gt;Trenbath, B.R. 1976. Plant interactions in mixed cropping communities. pp.&amp;nbsp;129–169 in R.I. Papendick, A. Sanchez, G.B. Triplett (Eds.), ''Multiple Cropping''. ASA Special Publication 27. American Society of Agronomy, Madison, WI.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parthenocissus|Climbing plants]] can also benefit from structural support. Some plants are used to suppress weeds or provide nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2006|title=The science behind the Three Sisters mound system: An agronomic assessment of an indigenous agricultural system in the northeast|encyclopedia=Histories of maize: Multidisciplinary approaches to the prehistory, linguistics, biogeography, domestication, and evolution of maize|location=Amsterdam|last=Mt. Pleasant|first=Jane|pages=529–537|editor=John E. Staller|editor2=Robert H. Tykot|editor3=Bruce F. Benz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delicate or light-sensitive plants may be given shade or protection, or otherwise wasted space can be utilized. An example is the tropical multi-tier system where [[coconut]] occupies the upper tier, [[banana]] the middle tier, and [[pineapple]], [[ginger]], or leguminous [[fodder]], [[herbalism|medicinal]] or [[aromatic plants]] occupy the lowest tier.

Intercropping of compatible plants can also encourage [[biodiversity]], by providing a habitat for a variety of [[insect]]s and [[soil biology|soil organisms]] that would not be present in a single-crop environment. These organisms may provide crops valuable nutrients, such as through [[nitrogen fixation]].

=== Pest management ===
{{further|Pest control}}

There are several ways in which increasing crop diversity may help improve pest management. For example, such practices may limit outbreaks of crop [[pest (organism)|pest]]s by increasing predator biodiversity.&lt;ref name="AltieriNicholls2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Miguel Angel Altieri|author2=Clara Ines Nicholls|title=Biodiversity and Pest Management in Agroecosystems, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQI0PCnnbI8C|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, reducing the homogeneity of the crop can potentially increase the barriers against [[biological dispersal]] of pest organisms through the crop.

There are several ways pests can be controlled through intercropping:
* '''[[Trap crop]]ping,''' this involves planting a crop nearby that is more attractive for pests compared to the production crop, the pests will target this crop and not the production crop.
* '''Repellant intercrops,''' an intercrop that has a repellent effect to certain pests can be used. This system involved the repellant crop masking the smell of the production crop in order to keep pests away from it.
* '''Push-pull cropping,''' this is a mixture of trap cropping and repellant intercropping. An attractant crop attracts the pest and a repellant crop is also used to repel the pest away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://learn.uvm.edu/foodsystemsblog/2014/01/09/controlling-pests-with-plants-the-power-of-intercropping/|title=Controlling Pests with Plants: The power of intercropping - UVM Food Feed|date=2014-01-09|newspaper=UVM Food Feed|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The degree of spatial and temporal overlap in the two crops can vary somewhat, but both requirements must be met for a cropping system to be an intercrop. Numerous types of intercropping, all of which vary the temporal and spatial mixture to some degree, have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, D.J., A.H. Kassam. 1976. The importance of multiple cropping in increasing world food supplies. pp.&amp;nbsp;1–10 in R.I. Papendick, A. Sanchez, G.B. Triplett (Eds.), ''Multiple Cropping''. ASA Special Publication 27. American Society of Agronomy, Madison, WI.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Annual intercrops"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lithourgidis|first=A.S.|last2=Dordas |first2=C.A.|last3=Damalas|first3=C.A. |last4=Vlachostergios|first4=D.N.|year=2011|title=Annual intercrops: an alternative pathway for sustainable agriculture |url=http://www.cropj.com/anastasios_5_4_2011_396_410.pdf|journal=Australian Journal of Crop Science|volume=5 |issue=4|pages=396–410}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are some of the more significant types:
* '''Mixed intercropping''', as the name implies, is the most basic form in which the component crops are totally mixed in the available space.
* '''Row cropping''' involves the component crops arranged in alternate rows. Variations include alley cropping, where crops are grown in between rows of trees, and strip cropping, where multiple rows, or a strip, of one crop are alternated with multiple rows of another crop. A new version of this is to intercrop rows of [[solar photovoltaic]] modules with agriculture crops. This practice is called [[agrivoltaics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Dinesh| first = Harshavardhan| last2 = Pearce| first2 = Joshua M.| date = 2016-02-01| title = The potential of agrivoltaic systems| url = https://www.academia.edu/18406368/The_potential_of_agrivoltaic_systems| journal = Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews| volume = 54| pages = 299–308| doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2015.10.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Temporal intercropping''' uses the practice of sowing a fast-growing crop with a slow-growing crop, so that the fast-growing crop is harvested before the slow-growing crop starts to mature. 
* Further temporal separation is found in '''relay cropping''', where the second crop is sown during the growth, often near the onset of reproductive development or [[fruit]]ing, of the first crop, so that the first crop is harvested to make room for the full development of the second.

==== Limitations ====
Intercropping to reduce pest damage in agriculture, has been deployed with varying success. For example, while trap cropping has reduced pest densities at a commercial in experiments, it often fails to decrease pest densities deployed in large scale commercial landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=Ellner|first2=Stephen P.|last3=Lee|first3=Doo-Hyung|last4=Nyrop|first4=Jan P.|last5=Sanderson|first5=John P.|date=2012-06-01|title=Designing an effective trap cropping strategy: the effects of attraction, retention and plant spatial distribution|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02137.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |volume=49|issue=3|pages=715–722|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02137.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, increasing crop diversity through intercropping does not necessarily increase the presence of the predators of crop pests. In a systematic review of the literature, in 2008, in the studies examined, predators of pests tended only increased under crop diversification strategies in 53 percent of studies, and crop diversification only led to increased yield in only 32% of the studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poveda|first=Katja|last2=Gómez|first2=María Isabel|last3=Martínez|first3=Eliana|date=2008-12-01|title=Diversification practices: their effect on pest regulation and production|url=http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0120-04882008000200001&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal=Revista Colombiana de Entomología|volume=34|issue=2|pages=131–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Census of Marine Microbes''' is a field project of the [[Census of Marine Life]] that inventories microbial diversity by cataloging all known diversity of single-cell 
[[organisms]] including [[bacteria]], [[Archaea]], [[Protista]], and associated [[viruses]], exploring and discovering unknown microbial diversity, and placing that knowledge into ecological and evolutionary contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Agence France-Presse|title=Ocean census uncovers microbe world|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-04-19/ocean-census-uncovers-microbe-world/401272|accessdate=31 August 2017|work=ABC News|date=19 April 2010|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Qiu|first1=Jane|title=It's a microbial world|journal=Nature|date=18 April 2010|doi=10.1038/news.2010.190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kinver|first1=Mark|title=Census offers glimpse of oceans' smallest lifeforms|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8622608.stm|accessdate=31 August 2017|agency=BBC News|date=18 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Census of Marine Microbes (ICoMM)|url=http://www.coml.org/projects/international-census-marine-microbes-icomm|publisher=Census of Marine Life|accessdate=31 August 2017|language=coml|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317223727/http://www.coml.org/projects/international-census-marine-microbes-icomm|archivedate=17 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[applied mathematics]], '''lambda-connectedness ''' (or '''&amp;lambda;-connectedness''') deals with partial connectivity for a [[discrete space]].

Assume that a function on a discrete space (usually a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]) is given. A degree of connectivity (connectedness) will be defined to measure the connectedness of the space with respect to the function. It was invented to create a new method for image [[Segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]]. The method has expanded to handle other problems related to uncertainty for incomplete information analysis.  
&lt;ref name="lambda-connectedness"&gt;L. Chen, O. Adjei, D. Cooley, lambda-connectedness: Method and Applications, Proc. IEEE Conf on System, Man and Cybernetics 2000, pp 1157–1562, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lambda-connectedness1"&gt;L. Chen, O. Adjei, lambda-connectedness and its applications, Journal of Scientific and Practical Computing
Vol.3, No.1 (2009) 19–52 .&lt;/ref&gt;

For a digital image and a certain value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, two pixels are called &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-connected if there is a path linking those two pixels and the connectedness of this path is at least &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-connectedness is an equivalence relation.&lt;ref name="fuzzy subfiber"&gt;L. Chen, H.D. Cheng, and J. Zhang, Fuzzy subfiber and its application to seismic lithology classification, Information Sciences: Applications, Vol 1, No 2, pp 77–95, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Connectedness is a basic measure in many areas of mathematical science and social sciences. In graph theory, two vertices are said to be connected if there is a path between them. In [[topology]], two points are connected if there is a continuous
function that could move from one point to another continuously. In management science, for example, in an institution,
two individuals are connected if one person is under the supervision of the other. Such connected relations only describe either full connection or no connection. lambda-connectedness is introduced to measure incomplete or fuzzy relations between two vertices, points, human beings, etc.

In fact, partial relations have been studied in other aspects. [[Random graph]] theory allows one to assign a [[probability]] to each edge of a graph. This method assumes, in most cases, each edge has the same probability. On the other hand, [[Bayesian networks]] are often used for inference and analysis when relationships between each pair of states/events, denoted by vertices, are known. These relationships are usually represented by conditional probabilities
among these vertices and are usually obtained from outside of the system.

&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-connectedness is based on graph theory; however, graph theory only deals with vertices and edges with or without weights. In order to define a partial, incomplete, or fuzzy connectedness, one needs to assign a function on the vertex in the graph. Such a function is called a potential function. It can be used to represent the intensity of an image, the surface of a ''XY''-domain, or the utility function of a management or economic network.

==Basic concepts==

A generalized definition of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-connectedness can be described as follows: a simple system &lt;math&gt;\langle G,\rho\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is called a potential function of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\langle G,\rho\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is an image, then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a 2D or 2D grid space and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is an intensity function. For a color image, one can use &lt;math&gt;f=(\text{red},\text{green},\text{blue})&lt;/math&gt; to represent &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;.
 
A neighbor connectivity will be first defined on a pair of adjacent points. Then one can define the general connectedness for any two points.

Assume &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\rho(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is used to measure the neighbor-connectivity of x,y where x and y are adjacent.
In graph ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''V'',&amp;nbsp;''E''), a finite sequence &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; is called a path, if &lt;math&gt;(x_i,x_{i+1})\in E&lt;/math&gt;.

The path-connectivity &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; of a path &lt;math&gt;\pi=\pi(x_1,x_n)=\{x_1,x_2,...,x_n\}&lt;/math&gt;
is defined as
 
: &lt;math&gt; \beta_\rho(\pi(x_1,x_n)) =  \min \{ \alpha_{\rho}(x_i,x_{i+1}) | i=1,\ldots,n-1 \} &lt;/math&gt;
 
Finally,  the degree of connectedness (connectivity) of two vertices x,y with respect to &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
 
: &lt;math&gt; C_\rho(x,y) = \max \{ \beta(\pi(x,y)) | \pi \text { is a (simple) path}. \}&lt;/math&gt;
 
For a given &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, point &lt;math&gt;p=(x,\rho(x))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q=(y,\rho(y))&lt;/math&gt; are said to be &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-connected if &lt;math&gt;C_{\rho}(x,y)\ge \lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-connectedness is a equivalence relation. It can be used in image segmentation.

[[Image:Phoenix lander illustration 2006.jpg|thumb|Conceptual image of the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)]]]]

The '''Lunar and Planetary Laboratory''' (LPL) is a [[research]] center for [[planetary science]] located in [[Tucson]], [[Arizona]].  It is also a [[graduate school]], constituting the Department of Planetary Sciences at the [[University of Arizona]].  LPL is one of the world's largest programs dedicated exclusively to planetary science in a [[university]] setting.

==Background==

LPL was founded in 1960 by [[astronomer]] [[Gerard Kuiper]].  Kuiper had long been a pioneer in observing the [[solar system]], especially the [[Moon]], at a time when this was unfashionable among astronomers.  Among his contributions are the discovery of [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]] and [[Nereid (moon)|Nereid]], the detection of [[carbon dioxide]] on [[Mars]] and of [[methane]] on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and the prediction of the [[Kuiper Belt]].

Kuiper came to Tucson looking for greater independence than he had enjoyed at the [[University of Chicago]], the chance to build a community dedicated to solar system studies, and also to be closer to [[southern Arizona]]'s many potential sites for world-class [[observatories]], such as [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] (founded in 1958).  LPL was established under the auspices of the [[University of Arizona]], with Kuiper serving as director until his death.

LPL's endeavors are truly [[interdisciplinary]].  The accumulated knowledge and techniques of [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[geophysics]], [[geochemistry]], [[atmospheric science]], and [[engineering]] are all brought to bear upon the single goal of studying [[planetary system]]s.  Many students come to LPL having studied only one or two of these subjects in detail, so a broad-based curriculum is essential.

In 1973, the university established a graduate Department of Planetary Sciences, operating continuously with LPL.  This provided an administrative framework for LPL to admit [[graduate students]] and take a greater role in [[teaching]].  LPL's chief officer is simultaneously "head" of the department and "director" of the laboratory.  The current Head and Director is [[Timothy D. Swindle]].

==Spacecraft missions==
The Lunar and Planetary Laboratory has been involved in almost every interplanetary spacecraft sent. These are some of the major ones that it was or is involved:
* [[OSIRIS-REx]] – [[Asteroid]] – Responsible for the Principal Investigator, building the camera system, science operations, and Education and Public Outreach..
* [[MAVEN]] – [[Mars]] – Dr. Roger Yelle is an interdisciplinary scientist on the mission.
* [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix Scout Mission]] – [[Mars]] – Responsible for the Principal Investigator, building the camera systems and the TEGA instrument, and for science operations on the surface of Mars.
* [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] – [[Mars]] – Responsible for building and operating the [[HiRISE]] camera, the largest aperture camera ever sent to another planet.
* [[Mars Global Surveyor]] – [[Mars]] – Dr. Alfred McEwen is a participating scientist on the Mars Orbital Camera Team. Dr. Steve Bougher is a member of the MGS aerobraking team which is conducting aerobraking exercises (Fall 1997 and Fall 1998).
* [[Deep Space 2]] – [[Mars]] – One of the science team members was from the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory.
* [[2001 Mars Odyssey|Mars Odyssey]] – [[Mars]] – Responsible for the [[Gamma Ray Spectrometer (2001 Mars Odyssey)|Gamma Ray Spectrometer]], for building and maintaining it.

== Astronomical observations ==
The Lunar and Planetary Laboratory is involved with [[Spacewatch]], the program to identify [[near-Earth asteroid]]s, with the Planetary Atmosphere Project to measure the content of the atmospheres of various planets, with [[occultations]], the art of measuring the [[spectrography]] of a [[star]] when it passes behind a [[planet]], to see what a planet's [[atmosphere]] is composed of, with studies of the planet Mercury, with the [[Catalina Sky Survey]], related to the Spacewatch program, as well as interdisciplinary sciences such as Theoretical [[Astrophysics]] and Space Physics, helping to find the answers to such questions as: What is [[Dark matter]]?

==Annual Events== 
The Art of Planetary science is an annual art exhibition run by the LPL to celebrate the beauty and elegance of science.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lpl.arizona.edu/art/&lt;/ref&gt; The art exhibit was founded by graduate students in 2013 as a public outreach program and as a means to bridge the gap between scientific and artistic communities. In 2017, The Art of Planetary Science displayed over 200 pieces of art from approximately 100 artists and scientists, drawing more than 700 guests. Says Geoff Notkin, "It is wonderful to see a real variety and innovative art both inspired by and for inspiring people interested in space, science, and exploration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rouch|first1=Michelle|title=Exploring the Solar System Through Art|url=http://www.thetanqueverdevoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/TVV-01_02-2016-webmag.pdf|accessdate=16 May 2018|work=The Tanque Verde Voice|date=January–February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these include many species not popularly thought of as overly large, such as [[white-tailed deer]] and [[red kangaroo]].

In practice, the most common usage encountered in academic and popular writing describes land mammals roughly larger than a human that are not (solely) domesticated. The term is especially associated with the [[Pleistocene megafauna]] – the land animals often larger than modern counterparts considered archetypical of [[Quaternary glaciation|the last ice age]], such as [[mammoth]]s, the majority of which in northern Eurasia, the Americas and [[Australian megafauna|Australia]] became extinct within the last forty thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/larson/ice_age_animals.html# Ice Age Animals]. Illinois State Museum&lt;/ref&gt; It is also commonly used for the largest [[extant taxon|extant]] wild land animals, especially [[elephant]]s, [[giraffe]]s, [[hippopotamus]]es, [[rhinoceros]]es, and large [[bovines]]. (Of these five categories of large herbivorous mammals, only [[bovine]]s are presently found outside of [[Africa]] and southern [[Asia]], but all the others were formerly more wide-ranging.) Megafauna may be subcategorized by their [[Trophic species|trophic]] position into megaherbivores (e.g., [[elephants]]), megacarnivores (e.g., [[lion]]s), and, more rarely, megaomnivores (e.g., [[bear]]s).

Other common uses are for giant aquatic species, especially [[whales]], any larger wild or domesticated land animals such as larger [[antelope]] and [[cattle]], as well as numerous [[dinosaur]]s and other extinct giant reptilians.

The term is also sometimes applied to animals (usually [[extinction|extinct]]) of great size ''relative to'' a more common or surviving type of the animal, for example [[Meganisoptera|the {{convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} dragonflies]] of the [[Carboniferous]] period.

==Ecological strategy==
Megafauna – in the sense of the largest mammals and birds – are generally [[R/K selection theory|K-strategist]]s, with high longevity, slow population growth rates, low mortality rates, and (at least for the largest) few or no natural predators capable of killing adults.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/science/K-selected-species. ''Britannica.'' Retrieved 2017-4-2.&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics, although not exclusive to such megafauna, make them vulnerable to human [[overexploitation]], in part because of their slow population recovery rates.&lt;ref name="Barnosky2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Barnosky|first1=A.

==Evolution of large body size==
One observation that has been made about the evolution of larger body size is that rapid rates of increase that are often seen over relatively short time intervals are not sustainable over much longer time periods. In an examination of mammal body mass changes over time, the maximum increase possible in a given time interval was found to scale with the interval length raised to the 0.25 power.&lt;ref name = "Evans2012"/&gt; This is thought to reflect the emergence, during a trend of increasing maximum body size, of a series of anatomical, physiological, environmental, genetic and other constraints that must be overcome by evolutionary innovations before further size increases are possible. A strikingly faster rate of change was found for large decreases in body mass, such as may be associated with the phenomenon of [[insular dwarfism]]. When normalized to generation length, the maximum rate of body mass decrease was found to be over 30 times greater than the maximum rate of body mass increase for a ten-fold change.&lt;ref name = "Evans2012"/&gt;

===In terrestrial mammals===
[[File:Patagotitan vs Mammals Scale Diagram SVG Steveoc86.svg|thumb|Large terrestrial mammals compared in size to one of the largest sauropod dinosaurs, ''[[Patagotitan]]'']]
Subsequent to the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] that eliminated the non-avian dinosaurs about {{period start|Paleogene}} [[Megaannum|Ma]] (million years) ago, terrestrial mammals underwent a nearly exponential increase in body size as they diversified to occupy the ecological niches left vacant.&lt;ref name = "F.A.Smith"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Smith|first1=F.

This trend of increasing body mass appears to level off about 40 Ma ago (in the late [[Eocene]]), suggesting that physiological or ecological constraints had been reached, after an increase in body mass of over three orders of magnitude.&lt;ref name = "F.A.Smith"/&gt; However, when considered from the standpoint of rate of size increase per generation, the exponential increase is found to have continued until the appearance of ''[[Indricotherium]]'' 30 Ma ago. (Since generation time scales with ''body mass''&lt;sup&gt;0.259&lt;/sup&gt;, increasing generation times with increasing size cause the log mass vs. time plot to curve downward from a linear fit.)&lt;ref name = "Evans2012"&gt;{{cite journal

Megaherbivores eventually attained a body mass of over 10,000&amp;nbsp;kg. The largest of these, [[indricothere]]s and [[proboscid]]s, have been [[hindgut fermentation|hindgut fermenter]]s, which are believed to have an advantage over [[Foregut fermentation|foregut fermenter]]s in terms of being able to accelerate gastrointestinal transit in order to accommodate very large food intakes.&lt;ref name = "Clauss"&gt;{{cite journal

Among terrestrial mammals, the fastest rates of increase of ''body mass''&lt;sup&gt;0.259&lt;/sup&gt; vs. time (in Ma) occurred in [[perissodactyl]]s (a slope of 2.1), followed by [[rodent]]s (1.2) and proboscids (1.1),&lt;ref name = "Evans2012"/&gt; all of which are hindgut fermenters. The rate of increase for [[artiodactyl]]s (0.74) was about a third that of perissodactyls. The rate for [[carnivora]]ns (0.65) was slightly lower yet, while [[primate]]s, perhaps constrained by their [[arboreal]] habits, had the lowest rate (0.39) among the mammalian groups studied.&lt;ref name = "Evans2012"/&gt;

Terrestrial mammalian carnivores from several [[eutheria]]n groups (the [[artiodactyl]] ''[[Andrewsarchus]]'' - formerly considered a [[mesonychid]], the [[creodont]]s ''[[Megistotherium]]'' and ''[[Sarkastodon]]'', and the carnivorans ''[[Amphicyon]]'' and ''[[Arctodus]]'') all reached a maximum size of about 1000&amp;nbsp;kg&lt;ref name = "F.A.Smith"/&gt; (the carnivoran ''[[Arctotherium]]'' apparently actually got somewhat larger). The largest known [[metatheria]]n carnivore, ''[[Proborhyaenidae|Proborhyaena]] gigantea'', apparently reached 600&amp;nbsp;kg, also close to this limit.&lt;ref name = "Sorkin"/&gt; A similar theoretical maximum size for mammalian carnivores has been predicted based on the metabolic rate of mammals, the energetic cost of obtaining prey, and the maximum estimated rate coefficient of prey intake.&lt;ref name = "Carbone"&gt;{{cite journal

Analysis of the variation of maximum body size over the last 40 Ma suggests that decreasing temperature and increasing continental land area are associated with increasing maximum body size. The former correlation would be consistent with [[Bergmann's rule]],&lt;ref name = "Ashton"&gt;{{cite journal

===In marine mammals===
[[File:Baleen whale sizes.JPG|thumb|Baleen whale comparative sizes]]
Since tetrapods (first [[Marine reptile|reptiles]], later [[Marine mammal|mammals]]) returned to the sea in the Late Permian, they have dominated the top end of the marine body size range, due to the more efficient intake of oxygen possible using lungs.&lt;ref name = "Webb2015"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Webb | first = J. | title = Evolution 'favours bigger sea creatures' | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 2015-02-19 | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-31533744 | accessdate = 2015-02-22 | work = BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Helm2015"&gt;{{cite journal

Following this, the evolution of large body size in cetaceans appears to have come to a temporary halt, and then to have backtracked, although the available fossil records are limited. However, in the period from 31 Ma ago (in the [[Oligocene]]) to the present, cetaceans underwent a significantly more rapid sustained increase in body mass (a rate of increase in ''body mass''&lt;sup&gt;0.259&lt;/sup&gt; of a factor of 3.2 per million years) than achieved by any group of terrestrial mammals.&lt;ref name = "Evans2012"/&gt; This trend led to the largest animal of all time, the modern [[blue whale]]. Several reasons for the more rapid evolution of large body size in cetaceans are possible. Fewer [[Biomechanics|biomechanical]] constraints on increases in body size may be associated with suspension in water as opposed to standing against the force of gravity, and with [[Aquatic locomotion|swimming movements]] as opposed to [[terrestrial locomotion]]. Also, the greater heat capacity and thermal conductivity of water compared to air may increase the [[thermoregulation|thermoregulatory]] advantage of large body size in marine [[endotherm]]s, although diminishing returns apply.&lt;ref name = "Evans2012"/&gt;

Cetaceans are not the only marine mammals to reach unprecedented size in the modern era. The largest [[carnivora]]n of all time is the mostly aquatic modern [[southern elephant seal]].

This is also the period when megafaunal flightless herbivorous [[gastornithid]] birds evolved in the Northern Hemisphere, while flightless [[paleognath]]s evolved to large size on [[Gondwana]]n land masses and [[Europe]]. Gastornithids and at least one lineage of flightless paleognath birds originated in Europe, both lineages dominating niches for large herbivores while mammals remained below 45&amp;nbsp;kg (in contrast with other landmasses like [[North America]] and [[Asia]], which saw the earlier evolution of larger mammals) and were the largest European tetrapods in the [[Paleocene]].&lt;ref name="Buffetaut2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buffetaut|first1=E.|last2=Angst|first2=D.|title=Stratigraphic distribution of large flightless birds in the Palaeogene of Europe and its palaeobiological and palaeogeographical implications|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=138|date=November 2014|pages=394–408|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2014.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flightless paleognaths, termed [[ratite]]s, have traditionally been viewed as representing a lineage separate from that of their small flighted relatives, the [[Neotropic]] [[tinamou]]s. However, recent genetic studies have found that tinamous nest well within the ratite tree, and are the [[sister group]] of the extinct [[moa]] of New Zealand.&lt;ref name = "Mitchell2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Phillips2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Phillips MJ, Gibb GC, Crimp EA, Penny D |title=Tinamous and moa flock together: mitochondrial genome sequence analysis reveals independent losses of flight among ratites |journal=Systematic Biology |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=90–107 |date=January 2010  |pmid=20525622 |doi=10.1093/sysbio/syp079}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Baker2014"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msu153| title = Genomic Support for a Moa-Tinamou Clade and Adaptive Morphological Convergence in Flightless Ratites| journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution| year = 2014| last1 = Baker | first1 = A.

Predatory megafaunal flightless birds were often able to compete with mammals in the early [[Cenozoic]]. Later in the Cenozoic, however, they were displaced by advanced carnivorans and died out. In North America, the [[bathornithids]] ''[[Paracrax]]'' and ''[[Bathornis]]'' were apex predators but became extinct by the [[Early Miocene]]. In South America, the related [[phorusrhacid]]s shared the dominant predatory niches with metatherian [[Sparassodonta|sparassodont]]s during most of the Cenozoic but declined and ultimately went extinct after eutherian predators arrived from North America (as part of the [[Great American Interchange]]) during the [[Pliocene]]. In contrast, large herbivorous flightless ratites have survived to the present.

However, none of the largest predatory (''[[Brontornis]]''), possibly omnivorous (''[[Dromornis]]''&lt;ref name = "Murray 2004"&gt;{{cite book

Some earlier aquatic Testudines, e.g. the marine ''[[Archelon]]'' of the Cretaceous and freshwater ''[[Stupendemys]]'' of the Miocene, were considerably larger, weighing more than 2,000&amp;nbsp;kg.

The [[Holocene extinction]] (see also [[Quaternary extinction event]]), occurred at the end of the [[Last glacial period|last ice age glacial period]] (a.k.a. the [[Würm glaciation]]) when many giant ice age mammals, such as [[woolly mammoth]]s, went extinct in the [[Americas]] and northern [[Eurasia]].

An analysis of ''[[Sporormiella]]'' fungal spores (which derive mainly from the dung of megaherbivores) in swamp sediment cores spanning the last 130,000 years from [[Lynch's Crater]] in [[Queensland]], Australia, showed that the megafauna of that region virtually disappeared about 41,000 years ago, at a time when [[climate change]]s were minimal; the change was accompanied by an increase in charcoal, and was followed by a transition from rainforest to fire-tolerant [[sclerophyll]] vegetation. The high-resolution chronology of the changes supports the hypothesis that human hunting alone eliminated the megafauna, and that the subsequent change in flora was most likely a consequence of the elimination of browsers and an increase in fire.&lt;ref name="Biello"&gt;{{cite web

Continuing human hunting and environmental disturbance has led to additional [[Holocene extinction#Ongoing Holocene extinction|megafaunal extinctions in the recent past]], and has created a [[IUCN Red List critically endangered species|serious danger of further extinctions]] in the near future (see examples below).

A number of other [[Extinction event|mass extinction]]s occurred earlier in Earth's geologic history, in which some or all of the megafauna of the time also died out. Famously, in the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] the non-avian dinosaurs and most other giant reptilians were eliminated. However, the earlier mass extinctions were more global and not so selective for megafauna; i.e., many species of other types, including plants, marine invertebrates&lt;ref name="Alroy"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Consequences of depletion of megafauna===

====Effect on nutrient transport====
Megafauna play a significant role in the lateral transport of mineral nutrients in an ecosystem, tending to translocate them from areas of high to those of lower abundance. They do so by their movement between the time they consume the nutrient and the time they release it through elimination (or, to a much lesser extent, through decomposition after death).&lt;ref name="Wolf2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolf|first1=A.|last2=Doughty|first2=C. E.|last3=Malhi|first3=Y.|authorlink3=Yadvinder Malhi|title=Lateral Diffusion of Nutrients by Mammalian Herbivores in Terrestrial Ecosystems|journal=[[PLoS ONE]]|volume= 8|issue= 8|year= 2013|pages= e71352|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0071352|pmid=23951141|pmc=3739793|bibcode=2013PLoSO...871352W}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South America's [[Amazon Basin]], it is estimated that such lateral diffusion was reduced over 98% following the megafaunal extinctions that occurred roughly 12,500 years ago.&lt;ref name = "Marshall_2013"&gt;{{cite web

====Effect on methane emissions====
Large populations of megaherbivores have the potential to contribute greatly to the atmospheric concentration of [[methane]], which is an important [[greenhouse gas]]. Modern [[ruminant]] [[herbivores]] produce methane as a byproduct of [[foregut fermentation]] in digestion, and release it through belching or flatulence. Today, around 20% of annual [[methane emissions]] come from livestock methane release. In the [[Mesozoic]], it has been estimated that [[sauropod]]s could have emitted 520 million tons of methane to the atmosphere annually,&lt;ref name = "Wilkinson"&gt;{{cite journal

After early humans migrated to the Americas about 13,000 [[Before Present|BP]], their hunting and other associated ecological impacts led to the extinction of many megafaunal species there. Calculations suggest that this extinction decreased methane production by about 9.6 million tons per year. This suggests that the absence of megafaunal methane emissions may have contributed to the abrupt climatic cooling at the onset of the [[Younger Dryas]].&lt;ref name = "Smith"/&gt; The decrease in atmospheric methane that occurred at that time, as recorded in [[ice core]]s, was 2-4 times more rapid than any other decrease in the last half million years, suggesting that an unusual mechanism was at work.&lt;ref name = "Smith"/&gt;

==Examples==
The following are some notable examples of animals often considered as megafauna (in the sense of the "large animal" definition). This list is not intended to be exhaustive:

*Clade [[Synapsida]]
**Class [[Mammalia]] ([[Phylogenetic nomenclature|phylogenetically]], a [[clade]] within Therapsida; see below)
***Infraclass [[Metatheria]]
****Order [[Diprotodontia]]
*****The [[red kangaroo]] (''Macropus rufus'') is the largest living [[Australia]]n mammal and [[marsupial]] at a weight of up to {{convert|85|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. However, its extinct relative, the [[Procoptodon|giant short-faced kangaroo]] ''Procoptodon goliah'' reached {{convert|230|kg|abbr=on}}, while extinct [[diprotodon]]ts attained the largest size of any marsupial in history, up to an estimated {{convert|2750|kg|abbr=on}}. The extinct [[marsupial lion]] (''Thylacleo carnifex''), at up to {{convert|160|kg|lb|abbr=on}} was much larger than any extant carnivorous marsupial.
***Infraclass [[Eutheria]]
****Superorder [[Afrotheria]]
*****Order [[Proboscidea]]
******[[Elephants]] are the largest living land animals. They and their relatives arose in [[Africa]], but until recently had a nearly worldwide distribution. The [[African bush elephant]] (''Loxodonta africana'') has a shoulder height of up to {{convert|4.3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and weighs up to {{convert|10.4|tonnes|ST}}.&lt;ref name=probos_mass&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Larramendi | first1 = A. | year = 2016 | title = Shoulder height, body mass and shape of proboscideans | journal = Acta Palaeontologica Polonica | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 537–574 |jstor =  | doi = 10.4202/app.00136.2014 | url = https://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app61/app001362014.pdf | accessdate = 2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among recently extinct proboscideans, [[mammoth]]s (''Mammuthus'') were close relatives of elephants, while [[mastodon]]s (''Mammut'') were much more distantly related. The [[steppe mammoth]] (''M. trogontherii'') is estimated to have commonly weighed around 10 tonnes, making it possibly the largest [[Proboscidea|proboscid]], which would make it the second largest land mammal after [[Indricotheriinae|indricotherines]].
*****Order [[Sirenia]]
******The largest sirenian at up to {{convert|1500|kg|lb|abbr=on}} is the [[West Indian manatee]] (''Trichechus manatus''). [[Steller's sea cow]] (''Hydrodamalis gigas'') was probably around five times as massive, but was exterminated by humans within 27 years of its discovery off the remote [[Commander Islands]] in 1741. In prehistoric times this sea cow also lived along the coasts of northeastern [[Asia]] and northwestern [[North America]]; it was apparently eliminated from these more accessible locations by aboriginal hunters.
****Superorder [[Xenarthra]]
*****Order [[Cingulata]]
******The [[Glyptodontidae|glyptodonts]] were a group of large, heavily armored [[Ankylosauria|ankylosaur]]-like [[xenarthra]]ns related to living [[armadillos]]. They originated in [[South America]], invaded North America during the [[Great American Interchange]], and went extinct at the end of the [[Pleistocene]] [[Series (stratigraphy)|epoch]].&lt;ref name = "Fariña2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fariña, Richard A.|author2=Vizcaíno, Sergio F.|author3=De Iuliis, Gerry |title=Megafauna: Giant Beasts of Pleistocene South America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kUAKgNfiAvoC&amp;printsec=frontcover|date=22 May 2013|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-00719-3|oclc= 779244424}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*****Order [[Pilosa]]
******[[Ground sloth]]s were another group of slow, terrestrial xenarthrans, related to modern [[sloth|tree sloth]]s. They had a similar history, although they reached North America earlier, and spread farther north (e.g., ''[[Megalonyx]]''). The largest genera, ''[[Megatherium]]'' and ''[[Eremotherium]]'', reached sizes comparable to elephants.&lt;ref name = "Fariña2013" /&gt;
****Superorder [[Euarchontoglires]]
*****Order [[Primates]]
******The largest living primate, at up to {{convert|266|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, is the [[gorilla]] (''[[Gorilla beringei]]'' and ''[[Gorilla gorilla]]'', with three of four subspecies being [[critically endangered]]). The extinct Malagasy [[sloth lemur]] ''[[Archaeoindris]]'' reached a similar size, while the extinct ''[[Gigantopithecus#Gigantopithecus blacki|Gigantopithecus blacki]]'' of [[Southeast Asia]] is believed to have been at least two times larger.

*****Order [[Rodent]]ia
******The extant [[capybara]] (''Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris'') of South America, the largest living rodent, weighs up to {{convert|65|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Several recently extinct North American forms were larger: the capybara ''[[Neochoerus pinckneyi]]'' (another [[Neotropic ecozone|neotropic]] migrant) was about 40% heavier; the [[Castoroides|giant beaver]] (''Castoroides ohioensis'') was similar. The extinct [[blunt-toothed giant hutia]] (''Amblyrhiza inundata'') of several [[Caribbean]] islands may have been larger still. However, several million years ago South America harbored much more massive rodents. ''[[Phoberomys pattersoni]]'', known from a nearly full skeleton, probably reached {{convert|700|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.

The [[southern elephant seal]] (''Mirounga leonina'') of [[Antarctic]] and [[subantarctic]] waters is the largest carnivoran of all time, with bull males reaching a maximum length of {{convert|6|-|7|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and maximum weight of {{convert|5000|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.
*****Order [[Perissodactyla]]
******[[Tapir]]s are browsing animals, with a short prehensile snout and pig-like form that appears to have changed little in 20 million years. They inhabit [[tropical rainforest|tropical forests]] of Southeast Asia and South and Central America, and include the largest surviving land animals of the latter two regions. There are four species.
******[[Rhinoceros]]es are [[odd-toed ungulates]] with horns made of [[keratin]], the same type of [[protein]] composing hair. They are among the second-largest living land mammals at 850-3,800&amp;nbsp;kg. Three of five extant species are [[IUCN Red List critically endangered species (Animalia)#Rhinocerotidae|critically endangered]]. Their extinct [[central Asia]]n relatives the [[Indricotheriinae|indricotherines]] were the largest terrestrial mammals of all time.[[File:Megafauna1.jpg|thumb|Rhinoceros, from [[Dürer's Rhinoceros|Dürer's woodcut]]]]
*****Order [[Artiodactyla]]
******[[Giraffes]] (''Giraffa spp.'') are the tallest living land animals, reaching heights of up to nearly {{convert|6|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The average weight is 1,192&amp;nbsp;kg (2,628&amp;nbsp;lb) for an adult male and 828&amp;nbsp;kg (1,825&amp;nbsp;lb) for an adult female with maximum weights of 1,930&amp;nbsp;kg (4,250&amp;nbsp;lb) and 1,180&amp;nbsp;kg (2,600&amp;nbsp;lb) recorded for males and females, respectively.
******[[Bovinae|Bovine ungulates]] include the largest surviving land animals of [[Europe]] and North America. The [[Wild water buffalo|water buffalo]] (''Bubalis arnee''), [[bison]] (''[[Bison bison]]'' and ''[[Wisent|B. bonasus]]''), and [[gaur]] (''Bos gaurus'') can all grow to weights of over {{convert|1000|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.

Retrieved 2007-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; or more in weight. The [[sperm whale]] (''Physeter macrocephalus'') is the largest [[toothed whale]], (and possibly the largest predator in vertebrate history) as well as the planet's loudest and [[Sperm whale#Brain|brainiest animal]] (with a [[brain]] about five times as massive as a [[human brain|human's]]). The [[killer whale]] (''Orcinus orca'') is the largest dolphin.
**Order [[Pelycosauria]] (traditional; [[paraphyletic]])
***''[[Cotylorhynchus]]'' was a large, big-clawed, herbivorous [[Caseidae|caseid]] of Early [[Permian]] North America, reaching {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} and 2 tonnes.
**Order [[Therapsida]]
*** ''[[Anteosaurus]]'' was a [[headbutting]], semiaquatic, carnivorous [[dinocephalia]]n of Middle Permian South Africa. It reached {{convert|5|–|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, and weighed about {{convert|500|–|600|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palaeos.org/Anteosaurus ''Anteosaurus''].

*Clade [[Sauropsida]]
**Class [[Aves]] (phylogenetically, a clade within [[Coelurosauria]], a [[taxon]] within the order Saurischia; see below)
***Order [[Struthioniformes]]
****The [[ratite]]s are an ancient and diverse group of [[flightless bird]]s that are found on fragments of the former [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. The largest living bird, the [[ostrich]] (''Struthio camelus'') was surpassed by the extinct ''[[Vorombe]]'' of [[Madagascar]], the heaviest of the group at up to ({{convert|860|kg|lb|abbr=on}}), and the extinct [[Dinornis|giant moa]] (''Dinornis'') of [[New Zealand]], the tallest, growing to heights of {{convert|3.4|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The latter two are examples of [[island gigantism]].
***Order [[Gastornithiformes]]
****Extinct [[Dromornithidae|dromornithid]]s of Australia such as ''[[Dromornis]]'' approached the largest ratites in size. (Due to its small size for a continent and its isolation, Australia is sometimes viewed as the [[Australia#Geography and climate|world's largest island]]; thus, these species could also be considered insular giants.)
***Order [[Cathartiformes]]
****The extinct [[condor]]-like [[teratorn]] ''[[Argentavis]]'' of South America had an estimated wing span of {{convert|5|to|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a mass of approximately {{convert|70|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, making it the best example of a megafaunal flying bird.
**Class [[Reptilia]] (traditional; [[paraphyletic]])
***Order [[Saurischia]]
****Saurischian [[dinosaur]]s of the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] include [[Sauropoda|sauropod]]s, the longest (at up to {{convert|40|m|ft|-1|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and most massive terrestrial animals known (''[[Argentinosaurus]]'' reached 80–100&amp;nbsp;[[metric ton]]nes, or 90–110&amp;nbsp;[[short ton|ton]]s), as well as [[Theropoda|theropod]]s, the largest terrestrial carnivores (''[[Spinosaurus]]'' grew to 7–9 tonnes; the more famous ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', to 6.8 tonnes).
***Order [[Pterosauria]]
****The largest [[azhdarchid]] [[pterosaur]]s, such as ''[[Hatzegopteryx]]'' and ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]]'', attained wingspans around {{cvt|11-12|m}} and weights probably in the {{cvt|70-250|kg}} range. The former is thought to have been the apex predator of its [[Hațeg Island|island ecosystem]].
***Order [[Crocodilia]]
****[[Alligators]] and [[crocodiles]] are large semiaquatic reptiles, the largest of which, the [[saltwater crocodile]] (''Crocodylus porosus''), can grow to a weight of {{convert|1360|kg|lb|-2|abbr=on}}. Crocodilians' distant ancestors and their kin, the [[Pseudosuchia#Evolution|pseudosuchians]] (traditional [[crurotarsan]]s), dominated the world in the late [[Triassic]], until the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event]] allowed dinosaurs to overtake them. They remained diverse during the later [[Mesozoic]], when [[Crocodyliformes|crocodyliforms]] such as ''[[Deinosuchus]]'' and ''[[Sarcosuchus]]'' reached lengths of 12 m. Similarly large crocodilians, such as ''[[Mourasuchus]]'' and ''[[Purussaurus]]'', were present as recently as the [[Miocene]] in South America.
***Order [[Squamata]]
****While the largest extant [[lizard]], the [[Komodo dragon]] (''Varanus komodoensis''), another island giant, can reach {{convert|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in length, its extinct Australian relative ''[[Megalania]]'' may have reached more than twice that size. These [[monitor lizard]]s' marine relatives, the [[mosasaur]]s, were [[apex predator]]s in late Cretaceous seas.
****The heaviest extant [[snake]] is considered to be the [[Eunectes murinus|green anaconda]] (''Eunectes murinus''), while the [[Python reticulatus|reticulated python]] (''Python reticulatus''), at up to 8.7 m or more, is considered the longest. An extinct Australian [[Pliocene]] species of ''[[Liasis]]'', the [[Bluff Downs giant python]], reached 10 m, while the [[Paleocene]] ''[[Titanoboa]]'' of South America reached lengths of 12–15 m and an estimated weight of about {{convert|1135|kg|lb|abbr=off|sigfig=2}}.
***Order [[Testudines]]
****The largest turtle is the [[critically endangered]] marine [[leatherback turtle]] (''Dermochelys coriacea''), weighing up to {{convert|900|kg|lb|-2|abbr=on}}. It is distinguished from other [[sea turtle]]s by its lack of a [[bone|bony]] [[exoskeleton|shell]]. The most massive terrestrial chelonians are the [[giant tortoise]]s of the [[Galápagos Islands]] (''[[Chelonoidis nigra]]'') and [[Aldabra|Aldabra Atoll]] (''[[Aldabrachelys gigantea]]''), at up to {{convert|300|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}.

**Order [[Temnospondyli]] (relationship to [[Lissamphibia|extant amphibians]] is unclear)
***The Permian temnospondyl ''[[Prionosuchus]]'', the largest amphibian known, reached 9 m in length and was an aquatic predator resembling a crocodilian. After the appearance of real crocodilians, temnospondyls such as ''[[Koolasuchus]]'' (5 m long) had retreated to the Antarctic region by the Cretaceous, before going extinct.
*Class [[Actinopterygii]]
**Order [[Tetraodontiformes]]
***The largest extant [[bony fish]] is the [[ocean sunfish]] (''Mola mola''), whose average adult weight is {{convert|1000|kg|lb|-2|abbr=on}}. While phylogenetically a "bony fish", its skeleton is primarily [[cartilage]] (which is lighter than [[bone]]). It has a disk-shaped body, and propels itself with its long, thin [[dorsal fin|dorsal]] and [[anal fin]]s; it feeds primarily on [[jellyfish]]. In these three respects (as well as in its size and diving habits), it resembles a leatherback turtle.

**Order [[Lamniformes]]
***The largest living predatory fish, the [[great white shark]] (''Carcharodon carcharias''), reaches weights up to {{convert|2240|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}. Its extinct relative ''[[megalodon|C. megalodon]]'' (the disputed genus being either ''Carcharodon'' or ''Carcharocles'') was more than an [[order of magnitude]] larger, and is the largest predatory shark or fish of all time (and possibly the largest predator in vertebrate history); it preyed on whales and other [[marine mammal]]s.
**Order [[Orectolobiformes]]
***The largest extant [[shark]], [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous fish]], and [[fish]] overall is the [[whale shark]] (''Rhincodon typus''), which reaches weights in excess of {{convert|21.5|t|lb|abbr=off}}. Like baleen whales, it is a [[filter feeder]] and primarily consumes [[plankton]].

'''Muḥammad Shafī‘ ibn Muḥammad Yāsīn ‘Us̱mānī Deobandī''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|محمد شفیع بن محمد ياسین عثمانی دیوبندی}}}}; {{lang-ar|محمد شفيع بن محمد ياسين العثماني الديوبندي}}, ''Muḥammad Shafī‘ ibn Muḥammad Yāsīn al-‘Uthmānī ad-Diyūbandī''; {{circa}} 25 January 1897{{spaced ndash}}6 October 1976),{{#tag:ref|ياسين (Yasin) also spelled یٰسین|group="note"}} often referred to as '''Mufti Muhammad Shafi''', was a [[Pakistani]] [[Sunni]] [[Islamic scholar]] of the [[Deobandi]] school of Islamic thought. A [[Hanafi]] [[faqih|jurist]] and [[mufti]], he was also an authority on [[shari'ah]], [[hadith]], ''[[tafsir]]'' (Qur'anic exegesis), and ''[[tasawwuf]]'' (Sufism). Born in [[Deoband]], [[British India]], he graduated in 1917 from [[Darul Uloom Deoband]], where he later taught hadith and held the post of Chief Mufti. He resigned from the school in 1943 to devote his time to the [[Pakistan Movement]]. After the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] he moved to Pakistan, where he established [[Darul Uloom Karachi]] in 1951. Of his written works, his best-known is ''[[Ma'ariful Qur'an]]'', a ''tafsir'' of the [[Qur'an]].

==Birth and early childhood==
Muhammad Shafi, son of Maulana Muhammad Yasin, was born on 21 Sha'ban 1314 [[anno hegirae|AH]] (c. 25 January 1897) in [[Deoband]], [[British India]] (in present-day [[Saharanpur district]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]]) to an [[Usmani]] family.&lt;ref name=taqi&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; He was given the name "Muhammad Shafi" ({{lang|ur|محمد شفيع}}) by his father's ''shaikh'', [[Maulana Rashid Ahmad Gangohi]], though he was originally named "Muhammad Mubin" ({{lang|ur|محمد مبین}}) by his grandfather, Khalifah Tahsin Ali.&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rizvi&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Shafi grew up in a religious environment. As a child he played in the courtyard of Darul Uloom Deoband and sat in the company of his father, who was a teacher at the school.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;

==Education==
At about the age of five, Shafi began ''nazirah'' (reading of the [[Qur'an]]) with Hafiz Muhammad Azim at the Darul Uloom.&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt; After reading the Qur'an, he did ''[[hifz]]'' (memorization of the Qur'an) with Hafiz Abdul Azim and Hafiz Namdar Khan.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;&lt;ref name=shafi&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1325 AH (1907/1908) he commenced the study of Urdu, Persian, mathematics and other subjects at Darul Uloom Deoband, which he completed within the next five years under the supervision of his father.&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt; He studied arithmetic and Euclid from his uncle Munshi Manzur Ahmad and ''[[tajwid]]'' from Qari Muhammad Yusuf Miruthi. Along with teaching Shafi the Persian books, Maulana Yasin also instructed him in the elementary [[Arabic]] books of ''sarf'' (morphology), ''nahw'' (grammar), and ''[[fiqh]]'' (jurisprudence), up to ''Fusul-i Akbari'', ''Hidayat an-Nahw'', and ''Munyat al-Musalli''.&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;

In 1330 AH (1912)&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; or 1331 AH (1913)&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt; Shafi was formally enrolled in the upper level Arabic classes of Darul Uloom Deoband. He did Daurah Hadith in 1335 AH (1916/1917) under the supervision of Anwar Shah Kashmiri, and completed his education in 1336 AH (1917/1918).&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt;&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt; The teachers under whom Shafi formally studied included:&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt;

*[[Allamah Anwar Shah Kashmiri]]
*[[Allamah Shabbir Ahmad Usmani]]
*Maulana Mufti Azizur Rahman Usmani
*Maulana Sayyid Miyan Asghar Husain Deobandi
*Maulana Muhammad Izaz Ali Amrohi
*Maulana Muhammad Rasul Khan

*Maulana Ghulam Rasul Hazarwi
*Maulana Muhammad Ahmad ibn [[Muhammad Qasim Nanautawi]]
 
Foremost among his teachers was Anwar Shah Kashmiri, who was the school's Sadr Mudarris (head teacher). Some of the books Shafi studied with him were ''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]'', ''[[Jami' at-Tirmidhi]]'' (with the exception of a small part), [[at-Tirmidhi]]'s ''[[Shama'il Muhammadiyah|Shama'il]]'' and '''Ilal'', ''al-Falsafah al-'Arabiyah'' on modern philosophy, and ''Sharh an-Nafisi'' on medicine (''tibb''). Shafi was among Kashmiri's closest students, and Kashmiri would later select Shafi for assistance in refuting the [[Ahmadiyya Movement]]. Shafi studied ''[[Sahih Muslim]]'' and half of ''[[al-Hidayah (book)|Hidayah]]'' with Shabbir Ahmad Usmani, whom he would later accompany in the movement to create Pakistan. With Maulana Asghar Husain he studied the hadith collections ''[[Sunan Abu Dawud]]'', ''[[Sunan an-Nasa'i]]'', and the remainder of ''Jami' at-Tirmidhi''. With Azizur Rahman, head of the Darul Uloom's [[Fatwa]] Department, Shafi studied the [[Muwatta Imam Malik|Muwatta]] of [[Imam Malik]] in the transmission of [[Yahya al-Laithi|Yahya ibn Yahya]] and the transmission of [[Muhammad al-Shaybani|ash-Shaybani]], [[at-Tahawi]]'s ''Sharh Ma'ani al-Athar'', ''[[Tafsir al-Jalalayn]]'', ''[[Mishkat al-Masabih]]'', [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]]'s ''Sharh Nukhbat al-Fikar'', and ''Hisn-i Hasin''. He studied ''Sunan Ibn Majah'' with Ghulam Rasul Hazarwi. With Izaz Ali he studied all the books of literature, [[Maibazi]]'s ''Sharh Hidayat al-Hikmah'', [[at-Taftazani]]'s ''Sharh al-'Aqa'id al-Nasafiyah'', Ubayd Allah al-Mahbubi's ''Sharh al-Wiqayah'', and some other treatises. With Maulana Muhammad Ibrahim he studied ''[[Mulla Sadra|Sadra]]'' and ''[[Shams al-Bazighah]]''.&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;

After Daurah a few books still remained, including ''Qazi'', ''Mir Zahid'', and ''Umur-i 'Ammah''—these were completed in 1336 AH (1917/1918).&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt; In that year Shafi was also appointed to teach some lessons.&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt;

==Teaching career==
Maulana Shafi was formally appointed as a teacher in Darul Uloom Deoband in 1337 AH (1918/1919).&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt;&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt; He began teaching the elementary level books of the curriculum and eventually reached the level of Daurah Hadith.&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt; The first book of Daurah level that he was given was ''[[Muwatta Imam Malik]]'', and he later taught other books. In 1354 AH (1935/1936) he was entrusted with teaching ''[[Sunan Abu Dawud]]'' for some time in place of Maulana Asghar Husain. On Husain's request he was given this lecture permanently, and he taught it until he left Darul Uloom Deoband in 1362 AH (1943). Shafi was regarded as an exceptional lecturer on many subjects, but two of his lessons were most famous—one was ''Sunan Abu Dawud'', and the other was ''Maqamat al-Hariri'' in Arabic literature.&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt; After leaving Darul Uloom Deoband, he taught ''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]'' for three months at [[Jamiah Islamiyah Dabhel]], filling in for [[Maulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani]].&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;

Shafi established [[Darul Uloom Karachi]] in Shawwal 1370 AH (1951). There he taught ''Sahih al-Bukhari'' for several years, as well as ''Muwatta Malik'' and ''[[Shama'il at-Tirmidhi]]''. Whenever due to health or other responsibilities he was unable to teach the whole of ''Bukhari'', then those years he would teach until the Book of Wudu, and other teachers would cover the remainder. In the last four years of his life, he was bedridden and thus unable to teach regularly. However, on the insistence of students and teachers, every year he taught the first lesson of ''Sahih al-Bukhari'' and the last lessons of the [[Sihah Sittah]].&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;

==Issuance of fatawa==
From the beginning of his teaching career Maulana Shafi frequently assisted Mufti Azizur Rahman, then head of the school's [[fatwa]] department.&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt; Azizur Rahman resigned from the Darul Uloom in 1344 AH (1925/1926). Others occupied the post of Sadr Mufti (Chief Mufti) until the Majlis-e-Shura of Darul Uloom Deoband appointed Shafi to the post on 28 Rabi al-Awwal 1350 AH (c. 13 August 1931).&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Mufti Muhammad Shafi writes in the introduction to ''Ma'ariful Qur'an'' that he occupied the post from 1349 AH.&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt;|group="note"}} In additions to undertaking the duties of fatwa-writing, Shafi also continued to teach some books of hadith and tafsir.&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt;

In Rajab 1351 (November 1932) Shafi published a tract entitled ''Nihayat al-arab fi ghayat an-nasab'' on [[Caste system among Muslims#In South Asia|caste]]. The weavers of the Deoband area (who were regarded as a lower caste) revolted against the fatwa, and from early 1353 AH (1934/1935) to late 1354 AH (1935/1936) rallies were held and threats were made against Shafi, in response to which a group of teachers took to acting as his bodyguards. Several scholars wrote or spoke in defense of the fatwa, including Shafi's shaikh Ashraf Ali Thanawi, Sayyid Asghar Husain, and Husain Ahmad Madani. Due to the controversy, Shafi asked to be transferred to the teaching department, a request that was eventually granted by the Majlis-e-Shura in Sha'ban 1354 AH (c. November 1935).&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buehler|first=Arthur F.|title=Sayyids and Sharifs in Muslim Societies: The Living Links to the Prophet|editor-last=Morimoto|editor-first=Kazuo|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780203123157|page=239|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5VnmEMh0MF4C&amp;pg=PA239|chapter=Trends of ashrāfization in India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shafi remained in the teaching department over the next few years, during which two other ulama held the post of Sadr Mufti. On 25 Safar 1359 AH (c. 4 April 1940), Shafi was appointed to the office a second time.&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt; He held the post until he left Darul Uloom Deoband in Rabi al-Awwal 1362 AH (March 1943).&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Rizvi writes that Shafi occupied the post until 1361 AH (1942).&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt;|group="note"}}

Estimates of the number of fatwas that he issued while at Darul Uloom Deoband range from 26,000&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt; to over 40,000. Some of Muhammad Shafi's fatwas have been published in eight large volumes titled ''Imdad al-Muftin'', while the majority remain unpublished.&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;

==Sufism==
From an early age, Shafi frequently attended the gatherings of [[Maulana Mahmud Hasan]]. Then when Mahmud Hasan was [[Malta exiles|imprisoned in Malta]], Shafi consulted [[Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanawi]]. Mahmud Hasan returned to Deoband on 20 Ramadan 1338 AH (June 1920). In 1339 AH (1920) Shafi gave ''bay'at'' (allegiance) at his hand. However, Mahmud Hasan died a few months later on 18 Rabi al-awwal AH (November 1920). Shafi returned to Thanawi after Mahmud Hasan's death. In Rabi ath-thani 1349 AH (1930) he received ''ijazat-i bay'at'' (permission to take disciples) and ''khilafah'' (spiritual successorship).&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;

==Pakistan Movement==
At the time Muhammad Shafi was teaching at Darul Uloom Deoband, Indians were struggling for independence from the British. When the [[All-India Muslim League]] was formed to campaign for the creation of a separate Muslim state, [[Ashraf Ali Thanvi]] instructed all ''[[ulama]]'' and Muslims in general to support this campaign. Muhammad Shafi, with other scholars including Zafar Ahmad Usmani, joined the [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam]], a council of Islamic scholars formed by [[Shabbir Ahmad Usmani]] to campaign for the creation of Pakistan. In 1363 AH (1944) Muhammad Shafi resigned from teaching and issuing fatwas at Darul Uloom Deoband in order to devote his time to the movement for the creation of Pakistan. He toured India, gave speeches, and issued ''fatwas'' for this purpose.&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;

==Migration to Pakistan==
After [[Pakistan Movement|independence]], in 1367 AH (1948), Muhammad Shafi left his hometown of Deoband and immigrated to Pakistan. He founded [[Darul Uloom Karachi]] in 1370 AH (1950/1951). Muhammad Shafi died on 10 Shawwal 1396 (6 October 1976).&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;

==Works==
He wrote around one hundred books [[Exegesis#Islam|explaining]] the [[Quran]] and interpreting [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. His best-known and most widely translated work is the ''[[Ma'ariful Qur'an]]'' ("The Wisdom of the Quran"), which he finished (in Urdu) four years before his death.&lt;ref name="ibid"&gt;''Ma'ariful Qur'an: A Comprehensive Commentary on the Holy Qur'an'' (Karachi: Mataba-e-Darul-Ulomm Karachi, 2008 ed.), Volume 1. p. xv&lt;/ref&gt; This work, a commentary on the entire Quran, began as a series of weekly lectures on [[Radio Pakistan]] that ran for ten years.&lt;ref name="ibid" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2591">The '''National Vulnerability Database''' is the U.S. government repository of standards-based vulnerability management data represented using the [[Security Content Automation Protocol]] (SCAP). This data enables automation of vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance. NVD includes databases of security checklists, security related software flaws, misconfigurations, product names, and impact metrics. NVD supports the [[Information Security Automation Program]] (ISAP).

On Friday March 8, 2013, the database was taken offline after it was discovered that the system used to run multiple government sites had been compromised by a software vulnerability of [[Adobe ColdFusion]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/03/14/adobe_coldfusion_vulns_compromise_us_malware_catalog/ "Adobe software vulnerabilities blamed for NIST NVD infection."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/03/14/us_malware_catalogue_hacked/ "US national vulnerability database hacked."]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2017, threat intel firm [[Recorded Future]] revealed that the median leg between a CVE2 being revealed to ultimately being published to the NVD is 7 days and that 75% of vulnerabilities are published unofficially before making it to the NVD, giving attackers time to exploit the vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/75--of-vulns-shared-online-before-nvd-publication/d/d-id/1329066"75% of Vulns Shared Online Before NVD Publication"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to providing a list of [[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures]] (CVEs), the NVD scores vulnerabilities using the [[Common Vulnerability Scoring System|Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)]] which is based on a set of equations using metrics such as access complexity and availability of a remedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nvd.nist.gov/cvsseq2.htm |title=NVD - CVSS v2 Equations |website=nvd.nist.gov |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221044001/http://nvd.nist.gov/cvsseq2.htm |archive-date=2013-12-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that this enables humans to determine the suitability of potential partners based on age, in addition to other factors.&lt;ref name="Mitro"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitro|first1=Susanna|last2=Gordon|first2=Amy R.|last3=Olsson|first3=Mats J.|last4=Lundström|first4=Johan N.|title=The Smell of Age: Perception and Discrimination of Body Odors of Different Ages|journal=PLOS ONE|date=30 May 2012|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0038110|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0038110|accessdate=10 February 2016|volume=7|pages=e38110|pmid=22666457|pmc=3364187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the [[Monell Chemical Senses Center]] published a press release claiming that the human ability to identify information such as age, illness, and genetic suitability from odor is responsible for the distinctive "old man smell".  Sensory neuroscientist Johan Lundström stated, "Elderly people have a discernible underarm odor that younger people consider to be fairly neutral and not very unpleasant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-05/mcsc-tss052412.php|title=The special scent of age|date=30 May 2012|work=EurekAlert!|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620161908/http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-05/mcsc-tss052412.php|archivedate=20 June 2015|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10707">'''Progymnasmata''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] προγυμνάσματα "fore-exercises"; [[Latin]] ''praeexercitamina'') are a series of preliminary [[rhetorical]] exercises that began in [[ancient Greece]] and distended during the [[Roman Empire]]. These exercises were implemented by students of [[rhetoric]], who began their schooling between ages twelve and fifteen. The purpose of these exercises was to prepare students for writing [[declamations]] after they had completed their education with the [[Linguist|grammarians]].
There are only four surviving handbooks of progymnasmata, attributed to [[Aelius Theon]], [[Hermogenes of Tarsus]], [[Aphthonius of Antioch]], and Nicolaus the [[Sophism|Sophist]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, George A. A New History of Classical Rhetoric. Princeton, NJ: Princeton UP, 1994.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Composition was not a primary subject taught in schools until the fifth century. In fact, the term “progymnasmata” first appeared in Chapter 28 of [[Rhetoric to Alexander]], most likely written by [[Anaximenes of Lampsacus]] in the late fourth century. This work is preserved alongside those of [[Aristotle]], yet he never mentions the use of preliminary exercises. But Aristotle does touch on the rhetorical forms, which became an aspect within the nature of progymnasmata. The use of preliminary rhetorical exercises is discussed briefly in some Greek and Roman dialogues, but all handbooks from that time remain lost today.
There are only four known surviving handbooks of progymnasmata. The earliest one is that of Theon, written some time during the first century A.D. In his introduction, Theon addresses teachers rather than students and criticizes students who skip out on these preliminary exercises.
The second handbook is attributed to one of the most influential rhetoricians of the second century, Hemogenes of Tarsus. But there is no preface to his work and the exercises are brief; therefore, many doubt its authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, George A., p.203 A New History of Classical Rhetoric. Princeton, NJ: Princeton UP, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; But the third handbook is attributed to Aphthonius of Antioch, student of the great sophist Libanius during the second half of the fourth century. This is the most widely used and referenced handbook that became the standard on the practice of progymnasmata. His treatises were combined with rhetorical treatises of Hermogenes on stasis theory and style to create the “Hermogenic Corpus.”
The final handbook is attributed to Nicolaus of Myra, who taught rhetoric in [[Constantinople]] during the late fifth century.

==Progymnasmata of Aphthonius==

Although the exercises expressed in each known handbook are very similar, there are several minor variations between them. But because the work of Aphthonius is the one most widely recognized and practiced, these variations are often unrecognized. All students were asked to write out each assignment, memorize it, and then perform a class oration. The progymnasmata were taught in order, increasing in difficulty as the course advances. The courses were organized to begin with story-telling and end with making an argument. There was a focus on literature as a supplement to the course, paying close attention to models of rhetoric and literature. The progymnasmata of Aphthonius was first translated to Latin in the fifteenth century by [[Rudolphus Agricola]].

===Fable (mythos)===

[[Aesop's fables]] were popular at the time rhetoric became a common topic of study. There are three forms of [[fable]]: the rational form (where characters are men and women), the ethical form (where animals are protagonists), and a third form involving both. What all three have in common is they each have a [[moral]], stated before the story begins or after it has concluded. In Aphthonius's handbook, the first exercise was to create a fable that followed the three forms.

===Narrative (diēgēma)===

This elementary assignment was to simply write a [[narrative]] (not to be confused with fable). It is assumed that this training is a result of Aristotle's theory of categories and introduces students to the four values of narrative, which is perspicuity, incisiveness, persuasiveness, and purity of language. The content of the narrative exercise in the progymnasmata is either political, historical, or based on fiction. Just as diegesis indicates the narrative plot of a film, the so-called narrative of a speech or oration moves the content forth.

===Anecdote (chreia)===

Students were asked to take an action or saying of a famous person and elaborate on it. They were to develop the meanings of these actions or quotes with the framing under the headings of praise, paraphrase, cause, example of meaning, compare and contrast, testimonies, and an epilogue; [[anecdote]] is something that is frequently used in the Bible.

===Maxim (gnōmē)===

[[Maxim (saying)|Maxim]] or [[proverbs]] were first described by Aristotle, and in Aphthonius's book are divided into, protheptic, apotreptic, declarative, simple, and compound. A moral generalization was given to students about a writer, and they were asked to create something similar to an anecdote about the writer.

===Refutation (anaskeuē)===

This exercise required the student to logically reason against something drawn from myths, narratives, or fables. The student's argument was that something was either impossible, illogical, unsuitable, and inexpedient.

===Confirmation (kataskeuē)===

The confirmation exercise is the opposite of refutation. The student was asked to reason in favor of something drawn from legends and literature.

===Commonplace (koinos topos)===

Working out the commonplace involved attacking vice by envisioning criticism of stereotypes rather than individuals. Students do this by using contradiction, comparison, and maxim attacking the motivation of the demographic described.

===Encomium (enkōmion)===

Students used [[encomium]] to praise persons, things, times, places, animals, and growing things. Each praise could be engendered from the headings upbringing, deeds, skills, and sometimes was in the form of a comparison with another person, an epilogue, or a prayer.

===Invective (psogos)===

[[Invective]] opposes commonplace. It attacks a specific, named individual, usually a political or cultural figure.

===Comparison (synkrisis)===

The [[comparison (grammar)|comparison]] exercise acts as a double encomium or a combination of an encomium of one person or thing and the invective against another.

===Personification (ēthopoeia)===

Students used [[personification]] or [[ethopoeia]] by forming a speech ascribed to the ghost of a known person or of an imaginary or mythological character from past, present, or future times. This exercise was intended to request students to perform it with clarity, conciseness, and floridity.

===Description (ekphrasis)===

When asked to use [[ekphrasis]] to describe a person, place, thing, or time, students were obliged to produce a description that was complete. Included was detailed information about a person from head-to-toe, an action from start to finish, etc. This form is seen in many classical literature and historical writings.

===Argument (thesis)===

Because this exercise is an introduction to argument in the philosophical schools, the use of [[thesis]] was not performed until first completing all previous exercises. Students had to come up with a thesis argument of their own nature; these questions were often ones difficult to answer.

===Introduction to law (nomou eisphora)===

Aphtonius calls this final exercise a gymnasma rather than progymnsasmata. This exercise is in the form of advocacy of a proposed law or opposition of it. The argument is first stated, a counterargument follows, and then the headings are discussed

==Progymnasmata for schools==
In the past few years there has been considerable effort expended to see if the Progymnasmata could be adapted for use in elementary, middle and high school education. One of the leaders in this effort is James Selby,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Selby|first1=James|title=James Selby|url=http://whitefieldacademy.org/teams/james-selby/|website=Whitefield Academy|publisher=Whitefield Academy|accessdate=17 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023215734/http://whitefieldacademy.org/teams/james-selby/|archivedate=23 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the author of the Classical Composition series, who has reduced the composition curriculum used by Quintilian and Cicero, to a level that can be effectively used by fourth through twelfth grade students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classical Composition|url=http://www.memoriapress.com/curriculum/writing/classical-composition|website=Memoria Press|publisher=Memoria Press|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhetorica and Progymnasmata is taught as a mandatory class in Sremski Karlovci, Serbia at [[Gymnasium of Karlovci]] high school, focusing on preparing students at early age for public speaking, as well as teaching classical rhetorics.

The progymnasmata is also taught at Highlands Latin School in Louisville, KY, as well as at Highlands Latin Cottage Schools (homeschooling support tutorials) around the United States.

'''[[Project]]-based learning''' ('''PBL''') is a [[Student-centred learning|student-centered]] [[pedagogy]] that involves a dynamic classroom approach in which it is believed that students acquire a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world challenges and problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edutopia.org/project-based-learning ''Project-Based Learning,'' Edutopia, March 14, 2016].  Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;  Students learn about a subject by working for an extended period of time to investigate and respond to a complex question, challenge, or problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bie.org/about/what_pbl ''What is PBL?'' Buck Institute for Education].  Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a style of [[active learning]] and [[inquiry-based learning]].  PBL contrasts with paper-based, rote memorization, or teacher-led instruction that presents established facts or portrays a smooth path to knowledge by instead posing questions, problems or scenarios.

Thomas Markham (2011) describes project-based learning (PBL) thus: "PBL integrates knowing and doing. Students learn knowledge and elements of the core curriculum, but also apply what they know to solve authentic problems and produce results that matter. PBL students take advantage of digital tools to produce high quality, collaborative products. PBL refocuses education on the student, not the curriculum—a shift mandated by the global world, which rewards intangible assets such as drive, passion, creativity, empathy, and resiliency. These cannot be taught out of a textbook, but must be activated through experience."&lt;ref&gt;Markham, T. (2011). Project Based Learning. Teacher Librarian, 39(2), 38-42.&lt;/ref&gt;  James G. Greeno (2006) has associated project-based learning with the "situated learning" perspective&lt;ref&gt;Greeno, J. G. (2006). Learning in activity. In R. K. Sawyer (Ed.), The Cambridge handbook of the learning sciences (pp. 79-96). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and with the [[Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)|constructivist]] theories of [[Jean Piaget]]. Blumenfeld ''et al.'' elaborate on the processes of PBL: "Project-based learning is a comprehensive perspective focused on teaching by engaging students in investigation. Within this framework, students pursue solutions to nontrivial problems by asking and refining questions, debating ideas, making predictions, designing plans and/or experiments, collecting and analyzing data, drawing conclusions, communicating their ideas and findings to others, asking new questions, and creating artifacts."&lt;ref&gt;Blumenfeld et al 1991, EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGIST, 26(3&amp;4) 369-398 "Motivating Project-Based Learning: Sustaining the Doing, Supporting the Learning." Phyllis C. Blumenfeld, Elliot Soloway, Ronald W. Marx, Joseph S. Krajcik, Mark Guzdial, and Annemarie Palincsar.&lt;/ref&gt; The basis of PBL lies in the authenticity or real-life application of the research. Students working as a team are given a "driving question" to respond to or answer, then directed to create an artifact (or artifacts) to present their gained knowledge. Artifacts may include a variety of media such as writings, art, drawings, three-dimensional representations, videos, photography, or technology-based presentations.

Proponents of project-based learning cite numerous benefits to the implementation of its strategies in the classroom –  including a greater depth of understanding of concepts, broader knowledge base, improved communication and interpersonal/social skills, enhanced [[leadership]] skills, increased [[creativity]], and improved writing skills. Another definition of project-based learning includes a type of instruction, where students work together to solve real-world problems in their schools and communities. Successful problem-solving often requires students to draw on lessons from several disciplines and apply them in a very practical way. The promise of seeing a very real impact becomes the motivation for learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education World|url=http://www.educationworld.com/a_curr/problem-based-learning-tips-ideas.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Dewey]] initially promoted the idea of "learning by doing". In ''My Pedagogical Creed'' (1897) Dewey enumerated his beliefs regarding education: "The teacher is not in the school to impose certain ideas or to form certain habits in the child, but is there as a member of the community to select the influences which shall affect the child and to assist him in properly responding to these.......I believe, therefore, in the so-called expressive or constructive activities as the centre of correlation."&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, Education and Experience, 1938/1997. New York. Touchstone.&lt;/ref&gt;(Dewey, 1897) Educational research has advanced this idea of teaching and learning into a methodology known as "project-based learning". Blumenfeld &amp; Krajcik (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, R. K. (2006) The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; cite studies by Marx ''et al.'', 2004, Rivet &amp; Krajcki, 2004 and William &amp; Linn, 2003 state that "research has demonstrated that students in project-based learning classrooms get higher scores than students in traditional classroom".

In ''Peer Evaluation in Blended Team Project-Based Learning: What Do Students Find Important?'', Hye-Jung &amp; Cheolil (2012) describe "social loafing" as a negative aspect of collaborative learning. Social loafing may include insufficient performances by some team members as well as a lowering of expected standards of performance by the group as a whole to maintain congeniality amongst members. These authors said that because teachers tend to grade the finished product only, the social dynamics of the assignment may escape the teacher's notice.&lt;ref&gt;

==Structure==
Project-based learning emphasizes learning activities that are long-term, interdisciplinary and student-centered. Unlike traditional, teacher-led classroom activities, students often must organize their own work and manage their own time in a project-based class. Project-based instruction differs from traditional inquiry by its emphasis on students' collaborative or individual artifact construction to represent what is being learned.

Project-based learning also gives students the opportunity to explore problems and challenges that have real-world applications, increasing the possibility of long-term retention of skills and concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crane|first1=Beverley|title=Using Web 2.0 Tools in the K-12 Classroom|date=2009|publisher=Neal-Schuman Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-1-55570-653-1|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements==
The core idea of project-based learning is that real-world problems capture students' interest and provoke serious thinking as the students acquire and apply new knowledge in a problem-solving context. The teacher plays the role of facilitator, working with students to frame worthwhile questions, structuring meaningful tasks, coaching both knowledge development and social skills, and carefully assessing what students have learned from the experience. Typical projects present a problem to solve (What is the best way to reduce the pollution in the schoolyard pond?) or a phenomenon to investigate (What causes rain?). PBL replaces other traditional models of instruction such as lecture, textbook-workbook driven activities and inquiry as the preferred delivery method for key topics in the curriculum. It is an instructional framework which allows teachers to facilitate  and assess  deeper understanding  rather than stand and deliver factual  information. PBL intentionally develops students' problem solving and creative making of products to communicate deeper understanding of key concepts and mastery of 21st Century essential learning skills such as critical thinking. Students become active digital researchers and assessors of their own learning when teachers guide student learning so that students learn from the project making processes. In this context, PBLs are units of self-directed learning from students' doing or making throughout the unit. PBL is not just "an activity" (project) that is stuck on the end of a lesson or unit.

==Examples==
[[File:Project based learning in secondary school Euroinstitut.jpg|thumb|Project based learning in secondary school Euroinstitut]]
Although projects are the primary vehicle for instruction in project-based learning, there are no commonly shared criteria for what constitutes an acceptable project. Projects vary greatly in the depth of the questions explored, the clarity of the learning goals, the content and structure of the activity, and guidance from the teacher. The role of projects in the overall curriculum is also open to interpretation. Projects can guide the entire curriculum (more common in charter or other alternative schools) or simply consist of a few hands-on activities. They might be multidisciplinary (more likely in elementary schools) or single-subject (commonly science and math). Some projects involve the whole class, while others are done in small groups or individually. For example, Perrault and Albert&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perrault|first=Evan K.|last2=Albert|first2=Cindy A.|date=2017-10-04|title=Utilizing project-based learning to increase sustainability attitudes among students|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1533015X.2017.1366882|journal=Applied Environmental Education &amp; Communication|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–10|doi=10.1080/1533015x.2017.1366882|issn=1533-015X}}&lt;/ref&gt; report the results of a PBL assignment in a college setting surrounding creating a communication campaign for the campus' sustainability office, finding that after project completion in small groups that the students had significantly more positive attitudes toward sustainability than prior to working on the project.

When PBL is used with [[21st century skills|21st century tools/skills]], students are expected to use technology in meaningful ways to help them investigate, collaborate, analyze, synthesize and present their learning. The term IPBL (Interdisciplinary PBL) has also been used to reflect a pedagogy where an emphasis on technology and/or an interdisciplinary approach has been included.

An example of a school that utilizes a project-based learning curriculum is [[Think Global School]]. In each country [http://www.thinkglobalschool.org (THINK Global School)] visits, students select an interdisciplinary, project-based learning module designed to help them answer key questions about the world around them. These projects combine elements of global studies, the sciences, and literature, among other courses. Projects from past years have included recreating Homer's The Odyssey by sailing across Greece and exploring the locations and concepts central to the epic poem, and while in Kerala, India, students participated in a project-based learning module centered around blending their learning and travels into a mock business venture. The interdisciplinary project was designed to enable students to engage in the key areas of problem solving, decision making and communication — all framed by the demanding parameters of a "[[Shark Tank]]", or "[[Dragons' Den (UK TV series)|Dragon's Den]]" style competition.

Another example of applied PBL is [[Muscatine High School]], located in Muscatine, Iowa. The school started the [http://www.g-squared.info G2 (Global Generation Exponential Learning)] which consists of middle and high school "Schools within Schools" that deliver the four core subject areas. At the high school level, activities may include making water purification systems, investigating service learning, or creating new bus routes. At the middle school level, activities may include researching trash statistics, documenting local history through interviews, or writing essays about a community scavenger hunt. Classes are designed to help diverse students become college and career ready after high school.

In 2009, The Illinois Consortium for 21st Century Schools lead by Deeper Learning author Jim Bellanca, initiated a 5-year deeper learning research project to identify the best practices and conditions among existing PBL models. In 6 pilot schools with students from the low performing to the highest performing, they piloted their findings. The goal was to test if all school/all day public schools could be transformed by  PBL as initiated in schools such as Manor New Tech, 
This would test if traditional schools with established faculty could make such this deep shift.

As a result of the all school adoption of PBL in  collaborative school wide cultures, several pilot schools earned accolades as P21 Exemplar schools
([http://www.p21.org/exemplar-program-case-studies/1301-case-study-franklin-elementary-school http://www.p21exemplars/Franklin]) with raised achievement results and obvious evidence of teacher practice change.  The model calls for all  teachers and administrators to engage in a multi-year professional development effort which changed school culture, teachers re designing their units of study, teachers  vetting all units and deciding which to contribute to a school based digital PBL library of unit plans and student artifacts, revisions in RTI,  revisions in teacher evaluation and in student "grading".as well as an upgrading of grade level PLCs. The model empowers teachers to change how they deliver instruction so that MindQuest21 PBL is the dominant model of instruction in every classroom. The model was assessed in one three school public district with a rising "free and reduced,lunch"  population.  Following the pilot years, the Consortium initiated this change program in Chicago Public Schools, Atlanta Public Schools, and in a rural Illinois statewide network. The P21 Exemplar school site provides videos and descriptions of the Illinois projects as well as other PBL projects across the country.

Another example is [[Manor Independent School District|Manor New Technology High School]], a public high school that since opening in 2007 is a 100 percent project-based instruction school.

It is reported that 98 percent of seniors graduate, 100 percent of the graduates are accepted to college, and fifty-six percent of them have been the first in their family to attend college.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edutopia.org/stw-project-based-learning-best-practices-new-tech-high-school#more|What Makes Project-Based Learning a Success?]. Retrieved 2013-10-29&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union]] has also providing funding for project-based learning projects within the [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]]. For example, [http://www.popullar.eu/ PopuLLar - Music and language learning], [http://www.clohe-movingtoys.eu/ Moving toys in the classroom] and [http://www.artined.eu/ ARTinED - A new approach to education using the arts].

According to Terry Heick on his blog, Teach Thought, there are three types of project-based learning. The first is Challenge-Based Learning/Problem-Based Learning, the second is Place-Based Education, and the third is Activity-Based learning. Challenge-Based Learning is "an engaging multidisciplinary approach to teaching and learning that encourages students to leverage the technology they use in their daily lives to solve real-world problems through efforts in their homes, schools and communities." Place-based Education "immerses students in local heritage, cultures, landscapes, opportunities and experiences; uses these as a foundation for the study of language arts, mathematics, social studies, science and other subjects across the curriculum, and emphasizes learning through participation in service projects for the local school and/or community." Activity-Based Learning takes a kind of constructivist approach, the idea being students constructing their own meaning through hands-on activities, often with manipulatives and opportunities to. As a private school provider [[Nobel Education Network]] combines PBL with the [[International Baccalaureate]] as a central pillar of their strategy.

==Roles==
PBL relies on learning groups. Student groups determine their projects, in so doing, they engage [[student voice]] by encouraging students to take full responsibility for their learning. This is what makes PBL [[constructivist learning|constructivist]]. Students work together to accomplish specific goals.

When students use technology as a tool to communicate with others, they take on an active role vs. a passive role of transmitting the information by a teacher, a book, or broadcast. The student is constantly making choices on how to obtain, display, or manipulate information. Technology makes it possible for students to think actively about the choices they make and execute. Every student has the opportunity to get involved either individually or as a group.

Instructor role in Project Based Learning is that of a facilitator. They do not relinquish control of the classroom or student learning but rather develop an atmosphere of shared responsibility. The Instructor must structure the proposed question/issue so as to direct the student's learning toward content-based materials. The instructor must regulate student success with intermittent, transitional goals to ensure student projects remain focused and students have a deep understanding of the concepts being investigated. The students are held accountable to these goals through ongoing feedback and assessments. The ongoing assessment and feedback are essential to ensure the student stays within the scope of the driving question and the core standards the project is trying to unpack. According to Andrew Miller of the Buck Institute of Education, formative assessments are used "in order to be transparent to parents and students, you need to be able to track and monitor ongoing formative assessments, that show work toward that standard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Andrew|title=Edutopia|url=http://www.edutopia.org/blog/effective-assessment-project-based-learning-andrew-miller|publisher=© 2013 The George Lucas Educational Foundation|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instructor uses these assessments to guide the inquiry process and ensure the students have learned the required content. Once the project is finished, the instructor evaluates the finished product and learning that it demonstrates

Student role is to ask questions, build knowledge, and determine a real-world solution to the issue/question presented. Students must collaborate expanding their active listening skills and requiring them to engage in intelligent focused communication. Therefore, allowing them to think rationally on how to solve problems. PBL forces students to take ownership of their success.

==Outcomes==
More important than learning science, students need to learn to work in a community, thereby taking on social responsibilities. The most significant contributions of PBL have been in schools languishing in poverty stricken areas; when students take responsibility, or ownership, for their learning, their self-esteem soars. It also helps to create better work habits and attitudes toward learning. In standardized tests, languishing schools have been able to raise their testing grades a full level by implementing PBL.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Although students do work in groups, they also become more independent because they are receiving little instruction from the teacher. With Project-Based Learning students also learn skills that are essential in higher education. The students learn more than just finding answers, PBL allows them to expand their minds and think beyond what they normally would. Students have to find answers to questions and combine them using critically thinking skills to come up with answers.

PBL is significant to the study of (mis-)conceptions; local concepts and childhood intuitions that are hard to replace with conventional classroom lessons. In PBL, project science ''is'' the community culture; the student groups themselves resolve their understandings of phenomena with their own knowledge building. Technology allows them to search in more useful ways, along with getting more rapid results.

Opponents of Project Based Learning warn against negative outcomes primarily in projects that become unfocused and tangential arguing that underdeveloped lessons can result in the wasting of precious class time. No one teaching method has been proven more effective than another. Opponents suggest that narratives and presentation of anecdotal evidence included in lecture-style instruction can convey the same knowledge in less class time. Given that disadvantaged students generally have fewer opportunities to learn academic content outside of school, wasted class time due to an unfocused lesson presents a particular problem. Instructors can be deluded into thinking that as long as a student is engaged and doing, they are learning. Ultimately it is cognitive activity that determines the success of a lesson. If the project does not remain on task and content driven the student will not be successful in learning the material. The lesson will be ineffective. A source of difficulty for teachers includes, "Keeping these complex projects on track while attending to students' individual learning needs requires artful teaching, as well as industrial-strength project management."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/blog/projects-partnerships-pbl-suzie-boss|title=Projects and Partnerships Build a Stronger Future - Edutopia|author=|date=|website=edutopia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like any approach, Project Based Learning is only beneficial when applied successfully.

[[Problem-based learning]] is a similar pedagogic approach, however, problem-based approaches structure students' activities more by asking them to solve specific (open-ended) problems rather than relying on students to come up with their own problems in the course of completing a project.

A meta-analysis conducted by Purdue University found that when implemented well, PBL can increase long-term retention of material and replicable skill, as well as improve teachers' and students' attitudes towards learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/ijpbl/vol3/iss1/4/|title=When is PBL More Effective?

==Overcoming obstacles and criticisms==
A frequent criticism of PBL is that when students work in groups some will "slack off" or sit back and let the others do all the work.  Anne Shaw recommends that teachers always build into the structure of the PBL curriculum an organizational strategy known as Jigsaw and Expert Groups.  This structure forces students to be self-directed, independent and to work interdependently.

This means that the class is assigned (preferably randomly, by lottery) to Expert Groups.  Each of the Expert Groups is then assigned to deeply study one particular facet of the overall project.  For example, a class studying about environmental issues in their community may be divided into the following Expert Groups:

#  Air
#  Land
#  Water
#  Human impact on the environment

Each Expert Group is tasked with studying the materials for their group, taking notes, then preparing to teach what they learned to the rest of the students in the class.  To do so, the class will "jigsaw", thus creating Jigsaw Groups.  The Jigsaw Groups in the above example would each be composed of one representative from each of the Expert Groups, so each Jigsaw Group would include:

#  One expert on Air
#  One expert on Land
#  One expert on Water
#  One expert on "Human impact on the environment"

Each of these experts would then take turns teaching the others in the group.  Total interdependence is assured.  No one can "slack off" because each student is the only person in the group with that "piece" of the information.  Another benefit is that the students must have learned the concepts, skills and information well enough to be able to teach it and must be able to assess (not grade) their own learning and the learning of their peers.  This forces a much deeper learning experience.

Anne Shaw recommends that when students are teaching each other they also participate collaboratively in creating a concept map as they teach each other. This adds a significant dimension to the thinking and the learning.  The students may build upon this map each time they Jigsaw.  If a project is scheduled to last over the time period of six weeks the students may meet in their Expert Groups twice a week, and then Jigsaw twice a week, building upon their learning and exploration of the topics over time.

Once all the experts have taught each other, the Jigsaw Group then designs and creates a product to demonstrate what they now know about all four aspects of the PBL unit – air, land, water, human's impact.  Performance-based products may include a wide range of possibilities such as dioramas, skits, plays, debates, student-produced documentaries, web sites, Glogsters, VoiceThreads, games (digital or not), presentations to members of the community (such as the City Council or a community organization), student-produced radio or television program, a student-organized conference, a fair, a film festival.

Students are assessed in two ways:

#  Individual assessments for each student – may include research notes, teaching prep notes and teacher observation.  Other assessments may include those assigned by the teacher, for example, each student in the class must write an individual research paper for a topic of their choice from within the theme of the overall PBL.
#  Group assessments – each Jigsaw group creates and presents their product, preferably to an audience other than the teacher or their class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.21stCenturySchools.com 21st Century Schools].  Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
One concern is that PBL may be inappropriate in mathematics, the reason being that mathematics is primarily skill-based at the elementary level. Transforming the curriculum into an over-reaching project or series of projects does not allow for necessary practice of particular mathematical skills. For instance, factoring quadratic expressions in elementary algebra requires extensive repetition.

On the other hand, a teacher could integrate a PBL approach into the standard curriculum, helping the students see some broader contexts where abstract quadratic equations may apply. For example, Newton's law implies that tossed objects follow a parabolic path, and the roots of the corresponding equation correspond to the starting and ending locations of the object.

Another criticism of PBL is that measures that are stated as reasons for its success are not measurable using standard measurement tools, and rely on subjective rubrics for assessing results.

In PBL there is also a certain tendency for the creation of the final product of the project to become the driving force in classroom activities. When this happens, the project can lose its content focus and be ineffective in helping students learn certain concepts and skills. For example, academic projects that culminate in an artistic display or exhibit may place more emphasis on the artistic processes involved in creating the display than on the academic content that the project is meant to help students learn.

'''Prostate massage''' is the [[massage]] or stimulation of the male [[prostate]] gland for medical purposes or [[sexual stimulation]].

The prostate takes part in the [[Human sexual response cycle|sexual response cycle]], and is essential for the production of [[semen]]. Due to its proximity to the anterior rectal wall, it can be stimulated from the anterior wall of the [[rectum]] or externally via the [[perineum]].

==Medical uses==

===Digital rectal examination (DRE)===
Prostate massage is part of the digital [[rectal examination]] (DRE) routinely given to men by [[urologists]] in order to look for nodules of [[prostate cancer]] and to obtain an expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) specimen for [[microscopy]] and [[microbiological culture]] to screen for [[prostatitis]].

====Therapy for prostatitis====
{{Main article|Prostatitis}}
In the late 1990s, a small number of doctors tried prostate massage in conjunction with antibiotics for the treatment of [[Prostatitis#Category II: Chronic bacterial prostatitis|chronic bacterial prostatitis]] with uncertain results.&lt;ref name="pmid10527258"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nickel JC, Downey J, Feliciano AE, Hennenfent B |title=Repetitive prostatic massage therapy for chronic refractory prostatitis: the Philippine experience |journal=Techniques in Urology |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=146–51 |year=1999 |pmid=10527258 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12496826"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shoskes DA, Zeitlin SI |title=Use of prostatic massage in combination with antibiotics in the treatment of chronic prostatitis |journal= Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases|volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=159–162 |year=1999 |pmid=12496826 |doi=10.1038/sj.pcan.4500308}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent trials, however, prostate massage was not shown to improve outcomes compared to antibiotics alone.&lt;ref name="pmid16566972"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ateya A, Fayez A, Hani R, Zohdy W, Gabbar MA, Shamloul R |title=Evaluation of prostatic massage in treatment of chronic prostatitis |journal=Urology |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=674–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16566972 |doi=10.1016/j.urology.2005.10.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of these findings, prostate massage is not officially sanctioned in [[western medicine]] for the treatment of any medical disorder today. Prostatic massage should ''never'' be performed on patients with [[Prostatitis#Category I: Acute prostatitis (bacterial)|acute prostatitis]], because the infection can spread elsewhere in the body if massage is performed.&lt;ref name="pmid10584615"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nickel JC |title=Prostatitis: evolving management strategies |journal=The Urologic Clinics of North America |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=737–51 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10584615 |doi= 10.1016/S0094-0143(05)70215-9|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
Once the most popular therapeutic maneuver used to treat prostatitis, it was abandoned as primary therapy in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="pmid10374787"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nickel JC, Alexander R, Anderson R, Krieger J, Moon T, Neal D, Schaeffer A, Shoskes D |title=[Prostatitis unplugged? Prostatic massage revisited.] |journal=Tech Urol. |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |year=1999 |pmid=10374787 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s the ineffectiveness of drug treatments for chronic prostatitis led to a brief resurgence of interest in prostate massage.&lt;ref name="pmid10527258"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12496826"/&gt; In a recent trial, however, prostate massage was not shown to improve outcomes compared to antibiotics alone.&lt;ref name="pmid16566972"/&gt;

The practice is still used in some parts of China.&lt;ref name="pmid18597833"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang J, Liu L, Xie HW, Ginsberg DA |title=Chinese urologists' practice patterns of diagnosing and treating chronic prostatitis: a questionnaire survey |journal=Urology |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=548–51 |year=2008 |pmid=18597833 |doi=10.1016/j.urology.2008.03.061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risks===
Vigorous prostate massage has been documented to have injurious consequences:  periprostatic [[hemorrhage]],&lt;ref name="pmid14655640"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Buse S, Warzinek T, Hobi C, Ackerman D |title=[Prostate massage with unwanted consequences.

===Electroejaculation===
[[Electroejaculation]] is a procedure in which nerves are stimulated via an electric probe, which is inserted into the rectum adjacent to the prostate. The stimulus voltage stimulates nearby nerves, resulting in contraction of the pelvic muscles and ejaculation. It is most commonly encountered in [[animal husbandry]] for the purpose of [[semen collection|collecting semen samples]] for testing or breeding. Some devices are used under general anesthesia on humans who have certain types of [[anejaculation]].&lt;ref name="human-electroej"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cornellurology.com/clinical-conditions/male-infertility/sperm-retrieval-techniques/electroejaculation/ |title=Electroejaculation |accessdate=2014-10-24 |publisher=Cornell Urology |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510030803/https://www.cornellurology.com/clinical-conditions/male-infertility/sperm-retrieval-techniques/electroejaculation/ |archivedate=10 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Electroejaculation is a different procedure from manual prostate massage.

==As a sexual practice==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2015}}

===General===
Prostate massage is also used for sexual stimulation, often in order to reach [[orgasm]]. It is possible for some men to achieve orgasms through [[prostate]] stimulation alone.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wibowo"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Multiple Orgasms in Men—What We Know So Far|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293195654|last1=Wibowo|first1=Erik|last2=Wassersug|first2=Richard J.|year=2016|journal=Sexual Medicine Reviews|volume=4|issue=2|doi=10.1016/j.sxmr.2015.12.004|pmid=27872023|pages=136–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prostate is sometimes referred to as the "male [[G-spot]]" or P-spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hitting the P-Spot|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-red-light-district/201410/hitting-the-p-spot|website=Psychology Today|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some men can achieve orgasm through stimulation of the prostate gland, such as prostate massage or receptive [[anal intercourse]], and men who report the sensation of prostate stimulation often give descriptions similar to females' accounts of G-spot stimulation.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Martha |last= Rosenthal| title = Human Sexuality: From Cells to Society | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2012|pages=133–135|accessdate = May 18, 2014| isbn = 978-0618755714|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&amp;pg=PT153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ladas&gt;{{cite book |last=Ladas |first=AK |author2=Whipple, B |author3=Perry, JD  |title=The G spot and other discoveries about human sexuality |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston |location=New York |year=1982 |isbn=978-0440130406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostate stimulation can produce a stronger, more powerful, and "deeper" orgasm than solely penile stimulation, described by some men as more widespread, intense, and enduring, and allowing for greater feelings of ecstasy than orgasm elicited by penile stimulation only.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; However, though the experiences are different, male orgasms by penile stimulation are also centered in the prostate gland.&lt;ref name="Lewin, Leap"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Ellen Lewin, William Leap, William L. Leap|title=Out in Theory: The Emergence of Lesbian and Gay Anthropology|isbn =978-0252070761|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|year=2002|pages=215–216|accessdate=December 22, 2013|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S02nNWBC3bMC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostate massage may also be a sexual practice in couples' sexual lives, although not as common. The availability of equipment and products for prostate massage can encourage people to try it. Many couples, though, do not purchase such devices but use a finger for anal penetration and prostate stimulation to enhance the man's orgasm. The finger or the prostate massager is introduced into the rectum through the anus and the prostate gland is gently massaged. The main problem in using the finger is that it may be too short to reach the prostate gland. Prostate massage can be performed individually or with the help of a partner.

There are safety matters relating to prostate stimulation and anal penetration. It is strongly recommended that plenty of lubricant be used with prostate massagers to prevent rectal lining damage. A smaller instrument or finger may be introduced gradually to minimize the discomfort that some may feel. Massagers may be used with or without a condom; however, because of the bacteria found in the rectum, if a condom is not used, it is very important to clean the tool with soap before use in another orifice or by a partner. Receiving anal stimulation may cause feelings of having to evacuate. More often than not, this is just a sensation that the stimulation causes and may take some getting used to.&lt;ref name="Ask Alice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/male-hot-spot-massaging-prostate |title= The male hot spot — Massaging the prostate |accessdate=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equipment===
A ''prostate massager'' is a device for massaging the prostate gland. The shape of a prostate massager is similar to a finger, since prostate massages are traditionally given digitally (for example, via [[fingering (sexual act)|fingering]]). They usually have a slightly curved head to effectively massage the prostate. Lubricant is necessary before inserting anything into the anus, so a lubricant is used. Caution should be exercised when a prostate massager is used because of the sensitivity of the prostate. Correct use involves a medium to light repetitive [[massage]], or circular motion—the device being used to administer the massage should not thrust.

Prostate massage equipment ranges from [[dildo]]s to [[butt plug]]s and [[G-Spot vibrator]]s.  When used in sexual practice, prostate massagers are commonly referred to as "prostate toys", "prostate [[sex toys]]", and "anal toys". These prostate massagers are inserted into the [[rectum]] through the anus and are intended to stimulate the prostate by simple massaging or vibrating. They are used during [[foreplay]] by many couples.

Prostate dildos are similar to vaginal dildos, but they tend to be more curved, slimmer and with a softer texture. Some of the new prostate dildos on the market are driven by [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and offer vibration at the tip; the speed or intensity of which may be changed depending on the subject's personal preference. Unlike vaginal dildos, the anal prostate massager has a flared end to prevent it from being fully inserted and 'lost' inside the rectum.

Some men prefer butt plugs, which are easy to use, can be inserted freely and left in place while the man's hands are free for other sexual activities such as [[masturbation]]. Anal plugs also come in various shapes, sizes and designs and are not commonly intended to stimulate the prostate.  Newer, more angled models (second generation) of prostate massagers have been developed to provide a more direct and thorough massage of the prostate gland.&lt;ref name="Helix"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aneros.com/prostate-massagers/helix/|title=Aneros Helix|accessdate=2010-04-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401063732/http://www.aneros.com/prostate-massagers/helix/|archivedate=1 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new devices feature a more curved shape and are slightly longer than the originals. They commonly have a narrow neck and a flared end to avoid losing them in the rectum.  While many massagers rely upon the body's own natural muscular contractions of the anal sphincter and anal wall to stimulate the prostate, some of the newer models come with vibrators built into them to increase sexual pleasure.

A G-spot vibrator can be used as a prostate massager as long as it is handled carefully and is provided with a safety base that will not allow it to be lost in the rectum. Vibrators for prostate stimulation usually have a pronounced curve at the end.

'''Prostitution''' is the business or practice of engaging in [[sexual activity]] in exchange for [[payment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prostitution – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prostitution|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prostitution Law &amp; Legal Definition|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/prostitution|publisher=US Legal|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution is sometimes described as '''sexual services''', '''commercial sex''' or, colloquially, '''hooking'''. It is sometimes referred to euphemistically as "'''the world's oldest profession'''" in the [[English-speaking world]].{{sfn|Flowers|1998|p=5}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/03/rush_limbaugh_calls_sandra_fluke_a_prostitute_is_prostitution_really_the_world_s_oldest_profession_.html|title=Rush Limbaugh calls Sandra Fluke a "prostitute": Is prostitution really the world's oldest profession?|author=Forrest Wickman|date=6 March 2012|website=Slate Magazine|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person who works in this field is called a '''prostitute''', and is a type of [[sex worker]]. 

Prostitution occurs in a variety of forms, and [[prostitution law|its legal status]] varies from [[Prostitution by country|country to country]] (sometimes from region to region within a given country), ranging from being permissible but unregulated, to an enforced or unenforced crime, or a regulated profession. It is one branch of the [[sex industry]], along with [[pornography]], [[Stripper|stripping]], and [[Erotic dance|erotic dancing]]. [[Brothel]]s are establishments specifically dedicated to prostitution. In [[Escort agency|escort prostitution]], the act may take place at the client's residence or hotel room (referred to as out-call), or at the escort's residence or a hotel room rented for the occasion by the escort (in-call). Another form is [[street prostitution]]. Although the majority of prostitutes are female and have male clients, a prostitute can be, and have clients of, any [[gender]] or [[sexual orientation]].

== Etymology and terminology ==
[[File:EN BESKYTTERINDE AF INDUSTRIEN.gif|thumb|Prostitute c.1890]]

''Prostitute'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''prostituta''. Some sources cite the verb as a composition of "''pro''" meaning "up front" or "forward" and "''stituere''", defined as "to offer up for sale".{{sfn|Perkins|Lovejoy|2007|pp=2–3}} Another explanation is that ''prostituta'' is a composition of ''pro'' and ''statuere'' (to cause to stand, to station, place erect). A literal translation therefore is: "to put up front for sale" or "to place forward". The ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'' states, "The notion of 'sex for hire' is not inherent in the etymology, which rather suggests one 'exposed to lust' or sex 'indiscriminately offered.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=prostitute&amp;searchmode=none |title=''prostitute'' |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/ |title=Perseus Digital Library |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''prostitute'' was then carried down through various languages to the present-day Western society. Most [[sex worker activists]] groups reject the word ''prostitute'' and since the late 1970s have used the term ''sex worker'' instead. However, ''sex worker'' can also mean anyone who works within the sex industry or whose work is of a sexual nature and is not limited solely to prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sex%20worker |title=''sex worker'' |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=13 August 2010 |accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1146/annurev-soc-070308-120025|title = Sociology of Sex Work| journal=Annual Review of Sociology| volume=35| pages=213–234|year = 2009|last1 = Weitzer|first1 = Ronald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dirck van Baburen - The Procuress - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Procuress (Dirck van Baburen)|The Procuress]]'' by [[Dirck van Baburen]] (1622)]]

A variety of terms are used for those who engage in prostitution, some of which distinguish between different types of prostitution or imply a value judgment about them. Common alternatives for ''prostitute'' include ''[[Escort agency|escort]]'' and ''whore''; however, not all professional escorts are prostitutes.

The English word ''whore'' derives from the [[Old English]] word ''hōra'', from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*hōrōn'' (prostitute), which derives from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[Proto-Indo-European root|root]] ''*keh₂-'' meaning "desire", a root which has also given us Latin ''cārus'' (dear), whence the French ''cher'' (dear, expensive) and the Latin ''cāritās'' (love, charity). Use of the word ''whore'' is widely considered [[pejorative]], especially in its modern slang form of ''ho''. In Germany, however, most prostitutes' organizations deliberately use the word ''Hure'' (whore) since they feel that ''prostitute'' is a bureaucratic term.  Those seeking to remove the social stigma associated with prostitution often promote terminology such as ''[[sex worker]]'', ''commercial sex worker'' (CSW) or ''sex trade worker''.  Another commonly used word for a prostitute is ''hooker''. Although a popular etymology connects "hooker" with [[Joseph Hooker]], a Union general in the [[American Civil War]], the word more likely comes from the concentration of prostitutes around the shipyards and ferry terminal of the [[Corlear's Hook]] area of [[Manhattan]] in the 1820s, who came to be referred to as "hookers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AmericanHeritage.com / History Now |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/1/2006_1_15.shtml |date=21 May 2006 |accessdate=22 December 2014 |deadurl= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521101352/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/1/2006_1_15.shtml |archivedate=21 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''streetwalker'' solicits customers on the streets or in public places, while a ''[[call girl]]'' makes appointments by phone, or in recent years, through email or the internet.

Correctly or not, use of the word ''prostitute'' without specifying a sex may commonly be assumed to be female; compound terms such as ''[[male prostitution]]'' or ''male escort'' are therefore often used to identify males.  Those offering services to female customers are commonly known as ''gigolos''; those offering services to male customers are ''hustlers'' or ''rent boys''.

===Procuring===
{{main|Procuring (prostitution)}}
Organizers of prostitution may be known as ''[[pimp]]s'' (if male) and ''[[madam]]s'' or ''[[Mama-san]]'' (if female). More formally, one who is said to practice procuring is a ''procurer'', or ''procuress''.

===Clients===
{{Redirect|Mongering|those who monger|Monger (disambiguation)}}
Clients of prostitutes, most often men by [[prevalence]], are sometimes known as ''johns'' or ''tricks'' in North America and ''punters'' in the [[British Isles]]. These slang terms are used among both prostitutes and law enforcement for persons who solicit prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.myredbook.com/dcforum2/DCForumID15/2.html |title=Adult Industry Terms and Acronyms |publisher=Forum.myredbook.com |accessdate=23 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209113009/http://forum.myredbook.com/dcforum2/DCForumID15/2.html |archivedate=9 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''john'' may have originated from the frequent customer practice of giving one's name as "John", a common name in [[English language|English-speaking]] countries, in an effort to maintain anonymity. In some places, men who drive around [[red-light district]]s for the purpose of soliciting prostitutes are also known as ''[[kerb crawler]]s''.

Female clients of prostitutes are sometimes referred to as ''janes'' or ''sugar mamas''.&lt;ref name="janes1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="janes2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sm1" /&gt;

=== Other meanings ===
The word "prostitution" can also be used metaphorically to mean debasing oneself or working towards an unworthy cause or "selling out".&lt;ref name="education.yahoo.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/prostitution |title=prostitution – Dictionary definition and pronunciation – Yahoo! Education |publisher=Education.yahoo.com |accessdate=23 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323211921/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/prostitution |archivedate=23 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, "prostituting oneself" or "whoring oneself" the services or acts performed are typically not sexual.  For instance, in the book ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', [[Holden Caulfield]] says of his brother ("D.B."): "Now he's out in Hollywood, D.B., being a prostitute. If there's one thing I hate, it's the movies. Don't even mention them to me." D.B. is not literally a prostitute; Holden feels that his job writing [[B-movie]] screenplays is morally debasing.

The prostitution metaphor, "traditionally used to signify political inconstancy, unreliability, fickleness, a lack of firm values and integrity, and venality, has long been a staple of Russian political rhetoric."&lt;ref name="jspsps-2015"&gt;Riabova, Tatiana and Riabova, Oleg (2015) "Gayromaidan" in Fedor, Julie; Portnov, Andriy; and Umland, Andraes (eds.) ''Journal of Soviet and Post-Soviet Politics and Society: Sociographic Essays on the Post-Soviet Infrastructure for Alternative Healing Practices, Volume 1, Issue 1'' Columbia University Press.

For the sake of the longed alliance with imperialist democracies [Stalin] has brought the Comintern to the last stages of political prostitution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/09/newwar.htm |publisher=Marxists.org |title = New War Flows from Versailles Banditry |author=Trotsky, Leon| authorlink = Leon Trotsky |date = September 1938 |accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides targeting political figures, the term is used in relation to organizations and even small countries, which "have no choice but to sell themselves", because their voice in world affairs is insignificant. In 2007, a Russian caricature depicted the Baltic states as three "ladies of the night", "vying for the attentions of Uncle Sam, since the Russian client has run out of money".&lt;ref name="jspsps-2015"/&gt;

Usage of the "political prostitute" moniker is by no means unique to Russian political lexicon, such as when a ''[[Huffington Post]]'' contributor expressed the opinion that [[Donald J. Trump]] was "prostituting himself to feed his ego and gain power" when he ran for President of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-gerdy/winner-or-just-another-po_b_9347740.html |publisher=The Huffington Post |title = Winner or Just Another Political Prostitute? |author=Gerdy, Tom |date = 29 February 2016 |accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex work researcher and writer Gail Pheterson writes that these metaphorical usages exist because "the term "prostitute" gradually took on a Christian moralist tradition, as being synonymous with debasement of oneself or of others for the purpose of ill-gotten gains".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/466259|jstor=466259|title=The Whore Stigma: Female Dishonor and Male Unworthiness|journal=Social Text|issue=37|pages=39|year=1993|last1=Pheterson|first1=Gail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were required to wear distinctive dresses and had to pay taxes. Some similarities have been found between the Greek ''[[hetaera]]'', the Japanese ''[[oiran]]'', and also the Indian ''[[tawaif]]''. Some prostitutes in ancient Greece, such as [[Lais of Corinth|Lais]] were as famous for their company as their beauty, and some of these women charged extraordinary sums for their services.

=== Ancient Rome ===
[[File:Pompeii-wall painting.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fresco]] from the [[Pompeii]] brothel]]

[[Prostitution in ancient Rome]] was legal, public, and widespread. A registered prostitute was called a [[meretrix]] while the unregistered one fell under the broad category '''''prostibulae'''''. There were some commonalities with the Greek system, but as the Empire grew, prostitutes were often foreign [[slavery|slaves]], captured, purchased, or raised for that purpose, sometimes by large-scale "prostitute farmers" who took [[child abandonment|abandoned children]]. Indeed, abandoned children were almost always raised as prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The First Apology (St. Justin Martyr) |url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm |website=New Advent |accessdate=26 August 2018|quote= But as for us, we have been taught that to expose newly-born children is the part of wicked men; and this we have been taught lest we should do any one an injury, and lest we should sin against God, first, because we see that almost all so exposed (not only the girls, but also the males) are brought up to prostitution.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enslavement into prostitution was sometimes used as a legal punishment against criminal free women. Buyers were allowed to inspect naked men and women for sale in private and there was no stigma attached to the purchase of males by a male aristocrat.

According to [[Shia]] Muslims, [[Muhammad]] sanctioned [[Nikah mut‘ah|fixed-term marriage]] – muta'a in Iraq and [[sigheh]] in Iran – which has instead been used as a legitimizing cover for sex workers, in a culture where prostitution is otherwise forbidden.{{sfn|İlkkaracan|2008|p=36}} [[Sunni]] Muslims, who make up the majority of Muslims worldwide, believe the practice of fixed-term marriage was abrogated and ultimately forbidden by either Muhammad, or one of his successors, [[Umar]]. Sunnis regard prostitution as sinful and forbidden.

In the early 17th century, there was widespread male and female prostitution throughout the cities of [[Kyoto]], [[Edo]], and [[Osaka]], Japan. [[Oiran]] were [[courtesan]]s in Japan during the [[Edo period]]. The oiran were considered a type of {{nihongo|''yūjo''|遊女}} "woman of pleasure" or prostitute. Among the oiran, the {{nihongo|''tayū''|太夫}} was considered the highest rank of courtesan available only to the wealthiest and highest ranking men. To entertain their clients, oiran practiced the arts of dance, music, poetry, and calligraphy as well as sexual services, and an educated wit was considered essential for sophisticated conversation. Many became celebrities of their times outside the pleasure districts. Their art and fashions often set trends among wealthy women. The last recorded oiran was in 1761. Although illegal in modern Japan, the definition of prostitution does not extend to a "private agreement" reached between a woman and a man in a [[brothel]]. [[Yoshiwara]] has a large number of [[soapland]]s that began when explicit prostitution in Japan became illegal, where women washed men's bodies. They were originally known as toruko-buro, meaning [[Turkish bath]].

A [[tawaif]] was a [[courtesan]] who catered to the nobility of South Asia, particularly during the era of the [[Mughal Empire]]. These courtesans danced, sang, recited poetry and entertained their suitors at [[mehfil]]s. Like the [[geisha]] tradition in Japan, their main purpose was to professionally entertain their guests, and while sex was often incidental, it was not assured contractually. High-class or the most popular tawaifs could often pick and choose between the best of their suitors. They contributed to music, dance, theatre, film, and the [[Urdu]] literary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/08/11/stories/2004081101090100.htm |title=Mapping cultures |publisher=The Hindu |date=11 August 2004 |accessdate=23 May 2010 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle Ages ===
{{Main|Courtesan}}
Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] the definition of a prostitute has been ambiguous, with various secular and canonical organizations defining prostitution in constantly evolving terms. Even though medieval secular authorities created legislation to deal with the phenomenon of prostitution, they rarely attempted to define what a prostitute was because it was deemed unnecessary "to specify exactly who fell into that [specific] category" of a prostitute.&lt;ref name="Rollo-Koster 2002 110"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rollo-Koster|first=Joelle|title=From Prostitutes to Brides of Christ: The Avignonese Repentises in the Late Middle Ages|journal=Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies|year=2002|volume=31|issue=1|page=110|doi=10.1215/10829636-32-1-109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known definition of prostitution was found in Marseille's thirteenth-century statutes, which included a chapter entitled De meretricibus ("regarding prostitutes").&lt;ref name="Rollo-Koster 2002 110" /&gt; The Marseillais designated prostitutes as "public girls" who, day and night, received two or more men in their house, and as a woman who "did business trading [their bodies], within the confine[s] of a [[brothel]]."{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|2000|pp=243–260}} A fourteenth-century English tract, Fasciculus Morum, states that the term prostitute (termed '[[meretrix]]' in this document), "must be applied only to those women who give themselves to anyone and will refuse none, and that for monetary gain".{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|2000|pp=243–260}} In general prostitution was not typically a life-time career choice for women. Women usually alternated their career of prostitution with "petty retailing, and victualing," or only occasionally turning to prostitution in times of great financial need.{{sfn|Roberts|1992|p=65}} Women who became prostitutes often did not have the familial ties or means to protect themselves from the lure of prostitution, and it has been recorded on several occasions that mothers would be charged with prostituting their own daughters in exchange for extra money.{{sfn|Findlen|Fontaine|Osheim|2003|p=98}}
Medieval civilians accepted without question the fact of prostitution, it was necessary part of medieval life.{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=16}} Prostitutes subverted the sexual tendencies of male youth, just by existing. With the establishment of prostitution men were less likely to collectively rape honest women of marriageable and re-marriageable age.{{sfn|Rossiaud|1996|p=32}} This is most clearly demonstrated in [[St. Augustine]]'s claim that "the removal of the institution would bring lust into all aspects of the world."{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|1994|p=34}} Meaning that without prostitutes to subvert male tendencies, men would go after innocent women instead, thus the prostitutes were actually doing society a favor.

In urban societies there was an erroneous view that prostitution was flourishing more in rural regions rather than in cities, however it has been proven that prostitution was more rampant in cities and large towns.{{sfn|Rossiaud|1996|p=3}} Although there were wandering prostitutes in rural areas who worked according to the calendar of fairs, similar to riding a circuit, in which prostitutes stopped by various towns based on what event was going on at the time, most prostitutes remained in cities. Cities tended to draw more prostitutes due to the sheer size of the population and the institutionalization of prostitution in urban areas which made it more rampant in metropolitan regions.{{sfn|Rossiaud|1996|p=3}} Furthermore, in both urban and rural areas of society, women who did not live under the rule of male authority were more likely to be suspected of prostitution than their oppressed counterparts because of the fear of women who did not fit into a stereotypical category outside of marriage or religious life.{{sfn|Findlen|Fontaine|Osheim|2003|p=98}}
Secular law, like most other aspects of prostitution in the Middle Ages, is difficult to generalize due to the regional variations in attitudes towards prostitution.{{sfn|Karras|1998|pp=13–31}} The global trend of the thirteenth century was toward the development of positive policy on prostitution as laws exiling prostitutes changed towards [[sumptuary laws]] and the confinement of prostitutes to [[red light districts]].{{sfn|Sanger|1859|p=97}}

Sumptuary laws became the regulatory norm for prostitutes and included making [[courtesans]] "wear a shoulder-knot of a particular color as a badge of their calling" to be able to easily distinguish the prostitute from a respectable woman in society.{{sfn|Sanger|1859|p=97}} The color that designated them as prostitutes could vary from different earth tones to yellow, as was usually designated as a color of shame in the Hebrew communities.{{sfn | Knauer | 2002 | pp=95-117}} These laws, however, proved no impediment to wealthier prostitutes because their glamorous appearances were almost indistinguishable from noble women.{{sfn | Knauer | 2002 | p=101}}

Although brothels were still present in most cities and urban centers, and could range from private bordelages run by a procuress from her home to public baths and centers established by municipal legislation, the only centers for prostitution legally allowed were the institutionalized and publicly funded brothels.{{sfnm|Karras|1998|1p=32|Rossiaud|1996|2p=6}} However this did not prevent illegal brothels from thriving. Furthermore, brothels theoretically banned the [[patronage]] of married men and clergy also, but it was sporadically enforced and there is evidence of clergymen present in brawls that were documented in brothels.{{sfn|Rossiaud|1996|p=41}} Thus the clergy were at least present in brothels at some point or another. Brothels also settled the "obsessive fear of the sharing of women" and solved the issue of "collective security."{{sfn|Rossiaud|1996|p=42}} The lives of prostitutes in brothels were not cloistered like that of nuns and "only some lived permanently in the streets assigned to them."{{sfn|Rossiaud|1996|p=43}} Prostitutes were only allowed to practice their trade in the brothel in which they worked.{{sfn|Geremek|2006|p=216}} Brothels were also used to protect prostitutes and their clients through various regulations. For example, the law that "forbid brothel keepers [from] beat[ing] them."{{sfn|Karras|1998|p=106}} However, brothel regulations also hindered prostitutes' lives by forbidding them from having "lovers other than their customers" or from having a favored customer.{{sfn|Karras|1998|p=106}}

Courts showed the conflicting views on the role of prostitutes in secular law as prostitutes could not inherit property, defend themselves in court, or make accusations in court.{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|1994|p=37}} However, prostitutes were sometimes called upon as witnesses during trial.&lt;{{sfn|Karras|1998|pp=13–107}}

[[LiveScience]]. 15 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and the prevalence of other [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted diseases]] from the earlier 13th century, may have been causes of this change in attitude. By the early 16th century the association between prostitutes, plague, and contagion emerged, causing brothels and prostitution to be outlawed by secular authority.{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=41}} Furthermore, outlawing brothel-keeping and prostitution was also used to  "strengthen the criminal law" system of the sixteenth-century secular rulers.{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=44}}
[[Canon law]] defined a prostitute as "a promiscuous woman, regardless of financial elements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=London Commissary Court Act Books|year=1470–1473|publisher=Department of Manuscripts|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prostitute was considered a "whore … who [was] available for the lust of many men," and was most closely associated with promiscuity.{{sfn|Bennett|1989|p=81}}

The Church's stance on prostitution was three-fold: “acceptance of prostitution as an inevitable social fact, condemnation of those profiting from this commerce, and encouragement for the prostitute to [[repent]]."{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=13}} The Church was forced to recognize its inability to remove prostitution from the worldly society, and in the fourteenth century "began to tolerate prostitution as a lesser evil."{{sfnm|Rossiaud|1996|1p=160|Otis|1985|2p=12}} However, prostitutes were to be excluded from the Church as long as they practiced.{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|1994|p=36}} Around the twelfth century, the idea of prostitute saints took hold, with [[Mary Magdalene]] being one of the most popular saints of the era. The Church used Mary Magdalene's biblical history of being a reformed harlot to encourage prostitutes to repent and mend their ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karras|first=Ruth|title=Holy Harlots: Prostitute Saints in Medieval Legend|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|date=July 1990|volume=1|issue=1|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, religious houses were established with the purpose of providing asylum and encouraging the reformation of prostitution. 'Magdalene Homes' were particularly popular and peaked especially in the early fourteenth century.{{sfnm|1a1=Bullough|1a2=Brundage|1y=1994|1p=41|2a1=Roberts|2y=1992|2pp=73–4}} Over the course of the Middle Ages, [[popes]] and [[religious communities]] made various attempts to remove prostitution or reform prostitutes, with varying success.{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|1994|pp=41–42}}

With the advent of the [[Protestant Reformation]], numbers of Southern German towns closed their brothels in an attempt to eradicate prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/History/teaching/protref/women/WR0911.htm|title=L. Roper: Luther on sex, marriage and motherhood. The University of Warwick|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some periods prostitutes had to distinguish themselves by particular signs, sometimes wearing very short hair or no hair at all, or wearing [[veil]]s in societies where other women did not wear them. Ancient codes regulated in this case the crime of a prostitute that dissimulated her profession. In some cultures, prostitutes were the sole women allowed to sing in public or act in theatrical performances.

=== 18th century ===
According to [[Dervish]] Ismail Agha, in the ''Dellâkname-i Dilküşâ,'' the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] archives,{{sfn|Gazali|2001|p=106}}&lt;ref name=Nedim&gt;{{cite book|title=Nedim and the poetics of the Ottoman court|author=Kemal Sılay|isbn=978-1-878318-09-1|publisher=[[Indiana University]]|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Turkish bath]]s, the masseurs were traditionally [[Pederasty#The Middle East|young men]], who helped wash clients by soaping and scrubbing their bodies. They also worked as [[sex workers]].{{sfn|Toledano|2003|p=242 "[Flaubert, January 1850:] Be informed, furthermore, that all of the bath-boys are {{linktext|bardash}}es [male homosexuals]."}} The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] texts describe who they were, their prices, how many times they could bring their customers to [[orgasm]], and the details of their sexual practices.

During the British [[East India Company]]'s [[Company rule in India|rule in India]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, it was initially fairly common for British soldiers to engage in inter-ethnic [[prostitution in India]], where they frequently visited local Indian ''[[nautch]]'' dancers.&lt;ref name=Fisher-2007&gt;{{cite journal|title=Excluding and Including "Natives of India": Early-19th-Century British-Indian Race Relations in Britain|first=Michael H.|last=Fisher|journal=Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East|volume=27|issue=2|year=2007|pages=303–314 [304–5]|doi=10.1215/1089201x-2007-007|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As British females began arriving in British India in large numbers from the early to mid-19th century, it became increasingly uncommon for British soldiers to visit Indian prostitutes, and [[miscegenation]] was despised altogether after the events of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].{{sfn|Beckman|2003|pp=31–33}}

=== 19th century ===
In the 19th century, legalized prostitution became a public controversy as France and then the United Kingdom passed the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]], legislation mandating pelvic examinations for suspected prostitutes. This legislation applied not only to the United Kingdom and France, but also to their overseas colonies. France, instead of trying to outlaw prostitution began to view prostitution as an evil necessary for society to function. France chose to regulate prostitution, introducing a Morals Brigade onto the streets of Paris.{{sfn|Harsin|1985|pp=3, 25}}  A similar situation did in fact exist in the [[Russian Empire]]; prostitutes operating out of government-sanctioned brothels were given yellow internal passports signifying their status and were subjected to weekly physical exams. A major work, ''[[Prostitution, Considered in Its Moral, Social, and Sanitary Aspects]]'', was published by [[William Acton (doctor)|William Acton]] in 1857, which estimated that
the County of London had 80,000 prostitutes and that 1 house in 60 was serving as a brothel.{{Sfn|Gale|p=245}} [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s novel ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]'' describes legal prostitution in 19th-century Russia.

During this period, prostitution was also very prominent in the [[Barbary Coast, San Francisco]] as the population was mainly men, due to the influx from the [[Gold Rush]].{{sfn|Sears|2014| }} One of the more successful madams was [[Belle Cora (Arabella Ryan)|Belle Cora]], who inadvertently got involved in a scandal involving her husband, Charles Cora, shooting US Marshal William H. Richardson.{{sfn|Jensen|2011| }} This led to the rise of new statutes against prostitution, gambling and other activities seen as "immoral".{{sfn|Sears|2014| }}

The leading theorists of Communism opposed prostitution. Communist governments often attempted to repress the practice immediately after obtaining power, although it always persisted. In contemporary Communist countries, it remains illegal but is nonetheless common.{{sfn|Flowers|1998|p=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FSNB0G7f4CsC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=prostitution+in+former+soviet+countries&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vtvOji8f76&amp;sig=t6tNuWtoT4OzR2W5shTCYe1SfWM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwia4520td3aAhUGJ8AKHbOqCKY4ChDoAQhSMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=prostitution%20in%20former%20soviet%20countries&amp;f=false 169]}} The economic decline brought about by the collapse of the Soviet Union led to increased prostitution in many current or former Communist countries.&lt;ref name="Slate Explainer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wickman|first=Forrest|title="Socialist Whores": What did Karl Marx think of prostitutes?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2011/11/socialist_whores_what_did_karl_marx_think_of_prostitution_.html|accessdate=5 November 2011|newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate Magazine]]|date=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, prostitution was widely legal in the United States. Prostitution was made illegal in almost all states between 1910 and 1915 largely due to the influence of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]]. On the other hand, prostitution generated much national revenue in South Korea, hence the military government encouraged [[prostitutes in South Korea for the U.S. military|prostitution for the U.S. military]].&lt;ref name=IBT20130429&gt;{{cite news | first=Palash | last=Ghosh | title=South Korea: A Thriving Sex Industry In A Powerful, Wealthy Super-State | date=29 April 2013 | publisher=[[International Business Times]] | url =http://www.ibtimes.com/south-korea-thriving-sex-industry-powerful-wealthy-super-state-1222647 | accessdate = 21 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=joongang20081030&gt;{{cite news|first=Soo-mee |last=Park |title=Former sex workers in fight for compensation |date=30 October 2008 |publisher=[[Joongang Daily]] |url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2896741 |accessdate=21 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430220310/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2896741 |archivedate=30 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, the United Kingdom introduced the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]]. While this law did not criminalise the act of [[prostitution in the United Kingdom]] itself, it prohibited such activities as running a brothel. Soliciting was made illegal by the [[Street Offences Act 1959]]. These laws were partly repealed, and altered, by the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] and the [[Policing and Crime Act 2009]].

Beginning in the late 1980s, many states in the US increased the penalties for prostitution in cases where the prostitute is knowingly HIV-positive. Penalties for felony prostitution vary, with maximum sentences of typically 10 to 15 years in prison.

[[Sex tourism]] emerged in the late 20th century as a controversial aspect of Western tourism and [[globalization]].

In the 21st century, [[Afghan]]s revived a method of prostituting young boys which is referred to as "[[bacha bazi]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/dancingboys/view/ |title=The Dancing Boys of Afghanistan &amp;#124; FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
According to [[Shia]] Muslims, Muhammad sanctioned [[Nikah mut‘ah]] (fixed-term marriage, called muta'a in [[Iraq]] and [[sigheh]] in [[Iran]]) which has instead been used as a legitimizing cover for sex workers, in a culture where prostitution is otherwise forbidden.{{sfn|İlkkaracan|2008|p=36}} Some Western writers have argued that mut'ah approximates prostitution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Medieval Islamic Civilization: L-Z, index|url = https://books.google.com/?id=LaV-IGZ8VKIC&amp;pg=PA647&amp;dq=mutah+prostitution#v=onepage&amp;q=mutah%2520prostitution&amp;f=false|publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis|date = 1 January 2006|isbn = 9780415966924|language = en|first = Josef W.|last = Meri|first2 = Jere L.|last2 = Bacharach}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nikah misyar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n4Eye4ilLVkC&amp;pg=PA52 | title=Muslim World: Modern Muslim Societies | publisher=Marshall Cavendish | date=1 September 2010 | accessdate=5 April 2013 | author=Pohl, Florian | pages=52–53| isbn=9780761479277 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Julie Parshall writes that mut'ah is legalised prostitution which has been sanctioned by the Twelver Shia authorities.

"Most of the travelers describe the Shi'i institution of temporary marriage (sigheh) as 'legalized profligacy' and hardly distinguish between temporary marriage and prostitution."&lt;/ref&gt; Religious supporters of mut'ah argue that temporary marriage is different from prostitution for a couple of reasons, including the necessity of [[iddah]] in case the couple have sexual intercourse. It means that if a woman marries a man in this way and has sex, she has to wait for a number of months before marrying again and therefore, a woman cannot marry more than 3 or 4 times in a year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia-ahlul-bayt-dilp-team/temporary-marriage-islam-part-6-similarities-and Temporary Marriage in Islam Part 6: Similarities and Differences of Mut’a and Regular Marriage | A Shi'ite Encyclopedia | Books on Islam and Muslims | Al-Islam.org].

== Payments and salaries ==
Prostitutes' salaries and payments fluctuate according to the economic conditions of their respective countries. Prostitutes who usually have foreign clients, such as business travelers, depend on good foreign economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-news/redlight-district-hit-as-tourists-become-tightfisted-20090601-bsi8.html |title=Red-light district hit as tourists become tight-fisted |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=2009-06-01 |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Payment may vary according to regulations made by pimps, brothel keepers, madams, and procurers, who usually take a slice out of a prostitute's income.&lt;ref&gt;Global Perspectives on Gender and Work: Readings and Interpretations, Jacqueline Goodman – 2000 p.373&lt;/ref&gt; Prices may further depend on demand; popular, high-end prostitutes can earn significant amounts of money (upwards of $5,000 per client),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moreintelligentlife.com/story/the-economics-of-high-end-prostitutes |title=The Economics Of High-End Prostitutes |publisher=More Intelligent Life |date=2008-04-10 |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and virgins may receive even higher payments.

=== Attitudes ===
{{Further|Feminist views on prostitution}}

Roughly speaking, the possible attitudes are:
* "Prostitution should be tolerated by society":
** [[decriminalization]]: "prostitution is labor like any other. Sex industry premises should not be subject to any special regulation or laws", the current situation in New Zealand; the laws against operating a brothel, pimping and street prostitution are struck down, but prostitution is hardly regulated at all. Proponents of this view often cite instances of government regulation under legalization that they consider intrusive, demeaning, or violent, but feel that criminalization adversely affects sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sexworkeurope.org/sites/default/files/userfiles/files/join/manbrussels2005.pdf Sex Workers in Europe Manifesto].

Amnesty International. Published 14 August 2015. Retrieved 23 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
** regulation: prostitution may be considered a legitimate business; prostitution and the employment of prostitutes are legal, but regulated; the current situation in the Netherlands, Germany, most of [[Prostitution in Australia|Australia]] and parts of [[Nevada]] (see [[Prostitution in Nevada]]). The degree of regulation varies very much; for example, in the Netherlands, prostitutes are not required to undergo mandatory health checks (see [[Prostitution in the Netherlands]]), while in [[Nevada]], the regulations are very strict (see [[Prostitution in Nevada]])
* "Prostitution should not be tolerated":
** [[Abolition of prostitution|abolitionism]] (prostitution itself is not prohibited, but most associated activities are illegal, in an attempt to make it more difficult to engage in prostitution, prostitution is heavily discouraged and seen as a social problem): prostitution (the exchange of sexual services for money) is legal, but the surrounding activities such as public [[solicitation]], operating a [[brothel]] and other forms of [[pimp]]ing are prohibited, the current situation in Great Britain and Italy among others;
** [[Abolition of prostitution|neo-abolitionism]] ("prostitution is a form of [[violence against women]], it is a violation of human rights, the clients of the prostitutes exploit the prostitutes"): prostitutes are not prosecuted, but their clients and pimps are, which is the current situation in Sweden, France, Norway and Iceland (in Norway the law is even more strict, forbidding also having sex with a prostitute abroad).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7806760.stm|title=New Norway law bans buying of sex|date=1 January 2009|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[prohibitionism]] (both prostitutes and clients are criminalized and are seen as immoral, they are considered criminals): the prevailing attitude nearly everywhere in the United States, with a few exceptions in some rural [[Nevada]] counties (see [[Prostitution in Nevada]])

In some countries, there is controversy regarding the laws applicable to [[sex work]]. For instance, the legal stance of punishing pimping while keeping sex work legal but "underground" and risky is often denounced as hypocritical; opponents suggest either going the full abolition route and criminalize clients or making sex work a regulated business.

Many countries have sex worker advocacy groups which lobby against criminalization and discrimination of prostitutes.
These groups generally oppose Nevada-style regulation and oversight, stating that prostitution should be treated like other professions. In the United States of America, one such group is [[COYOTE]] (an abbreviation for "Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics") and another is the North American Task Force on Prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayswan.org/NTFP.html |title=Prostitution: North American Task Force On Prostitution |publisher=Bayswan.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia the lead sex worker rights organisation is [[Scarlet Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scarletalliance.org.au/ |title=Scarlet Alliance, Australian Sex Workers Association is the national peak sex worker organisation in Australia |publisher=Scarletalliance.org.au |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; International [[Sex workers' rights|prostitutes' rights]] organizations include the [[International Committee for Prostitutes' Rights]] and the Network of Sex Work Projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nswp.org/ |title=Global Network of Sex Work Projects &amp;#124; Promoting Health and Human Rights |publisher=Nswp.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other groups, often with religious backgrounds, focus on offering women a way out of the world of prostitution while not taking a position on the legal question.

Prostitution is a significant issue in feminist thought and activism. Many feminists are opposed to prostitution, which they see as a form of exploitation of women and male dominance over women, and as a practice which is the result of the existing patriarchal societal order. These feminists argue that prostitution has a very negative effect, both on the prostitutes themselves and on society as a whole, as it reinforces stereotypical views about women, who are seen as sex objects which can be used and abused by men. Other feminists hold that prostitution can be a valid choice for the women who choose to engage in it; in this view, prostitution must be differentiated from [[forced prostitution]], and feminists should support sex worker activism against abuses by both the sex industry and the legal system.

In February 2014, the members of the European Parliament voted in a non-binding resolution, (adopted by 343 votes to 139; with 105 abstentions), in favor of the 'Swedish Model' of criminalizing the buying, but not the selling of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20140221IPR36644/html/Punish-the-client-not-the-prostitute|title=Punish the client, not the prostitute|website=European Parliament|date=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Prostitution law|Prostitution by country}}

The position of prostitution and the law varies widely worldwide, reflecting differing opinions on victimhood and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], [[Economic inequality|inequality]], [[gender role]]s, [[gender equality]], ethics and [[morality]], [[free will|freedom of choice]], historical [[social norm]]s, and [[sociology|social costs and benefits]].

Legal themes tend to address four types of issue: victimhood (including potential victimhood), ethics and morality, freedom of choice, and general benefit or harm to society (including harm arising indirectly from matters connected to prostitution).

Prostitution may be considered a form of exploitation (e.g., Sweden, Norway, Iceland, where it is illegal to buy sexual services, but not to sell them — the client commits a crime, but not the prostitute), a legitimate occupation (e.g., Netherlands, Germany, where prostitution is regulated as a profession) or a crime (e.g., many [[Muslim]] countries, where the prostitutes face severe penalties).

The legal status of prostitution varies from country to country, from being legal and considered a [[profession]] to being [[punishable by death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/iran.htm |title=Iran – Facts on Trafficking and Prostitution |publisher=Uri.edu |accessdate=23 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008164248/http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/iran.htm |archivedate=8 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions outlaw the act of prostitution (the exchange of sexual services for money); other countries do not prohibit prostitution itself, but ban the activities typically associated with it (soliciting in a public place, operating a brothel, pimping etc.), making it difficult to engage in prostitution without breaking any law; and in a few countries prostitution is legal and [[regulated prostitution|regulated]].

In 1949, the [[UN General Assembly]] adopted a [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others|convention]] stating that "prostitution and the accompanying evil of the traffic in persons for the purpose of prostitution are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/trafficpersons.htm |title=Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others |publisher=.ohchr.org |accessdate=26 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508080409/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/trafficpersons.htm |archivedate=8 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; requiring all signing parties to punish pimps and brothel owners and operators and to abolish all special treatment or registration of prostitutes. As of January 2009, the convention was ratified by 95 member nations including France, Spain, Italy, Denmark, and not ratified by another 97 member nations including Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States.

=== Advertising ===

In countries where prostitution is legal, advertising it may be legal (as in the [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|Netherlands]]) or illegal (as in [[Prostitution in India|India]]).
Covert advertising for prostitution can take a number of forms:
* by cards in newsagents' windows
* by cards placed in public telephone enclosures: so-called [[tart card]]s
* by euphemistic advertisements in regular magazines and newspapers (for instance, talking of "massages" or "relaxation")
* in specialist [[contact magazine]]s
* via the [[World Wide Web|Internet]]

In the United States, [[massage parlor]]s serving as a cover for prostitution may advertise "full service", a euphemism for coitus.{{sfn|Rathus|Nevid|Fichner-Rathus|2002| }}

In [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], prostitution is often promoted overtly on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] by third party workers distributing risque flyers with the pictures and phone numbers of escorts (despite the fact that prostitution is illegal in Las Vegas and [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]], see [[Prostitution in Nevada]]).

The way in which prostitutes advertise their presence varies widely. Some remain in apartments which have hints or clues outside such as posters with "model" written on them to lure potential customers inside. Others advertise by putting numbers or location in [[phonebox]]es or in online or newspaper ads. In more sexually permissive societies, prostitutes can advertise in public view, such as through display windows. In sexually restrictive societies it may occur through word-of-mouth and other means.{{sfn|Scambler|Scambler|1997|p=1920}}

== Socio-economic issues ==

=== Illegal immigration ===
{{Main|Illegal immigration}}
A difficulty facing migrant prostitutes in many developed countries is the illegal residence status of some of these women. They face potential deportation, and so do not have recourse to the law. Hence there are brothels that may not adhere to the usual legal standards intended to safeguard public health and the safety of the workers.

The immigration status of the persons who sell sexual services is – particularly in Western Europe – a controversial and highly debated political issue. Currently, in most of these countries most prostitutes are immigrants, mainly from Eastern and Central Europe; in Spain and Italy 90% of prostitutes are estimated to be migrants, in Austria 78%, in Switzerland 75%, in Greece 73%, in Norway 70% (according to a 2009 [[TAMPEP]] report, ''Sex Work in Europe-A mapping of the prostitution scene in 25 European countries'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tampep.eu/documents/TAMPEP%202009%20European%20Mapping%20Report.pdf |format=PDF |title=Sex work in Europe |publisher=Tampep.eu |accessdate=2015-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714160224/http://tampep.eu/documents/TAMPEP%202009%20European%20Mapping%20Report.pdf |archivedate=14 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
An article in ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'' in 1997 stated that 80% of prostitutes in [[Amsterdam]] were foreigners and 70% had no immigration papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/netherl.htm |title=Netherlands – Facts on Trafficking and Prostitution |publisher=Uri.edu |accessdate=26 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002222727/http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/netherl.htm |archivedate=2 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Survival sex ===
{{Main|Survival sex}}
Survival sex is when the prostitute is driven to prostitution by a need for basic necessities such as food or shelter. This type of prostitution is common among the [[homeless]] and in [[refugee camp]]s. The term is used in the sex trade and by [[aid workers]], although some practitioners do not regard the act as exploitative.

=== Use of children ===
{{Main|Prostitution of children}}
Regarding the [[prostitution of children]] the laws on prostitution as well as those on sex with a child apply. If prostitution in general is legal there is usually a minimum age requirement for legal prostitution that is higher than the general [[age of consent]] (see above for some examples). Although some countries do not single out patronage of child prostitution as a separate crime, the same act is punishable as sex with an underage person.

In India, the federal police say that around 1.2 million children are believed to be involved in prostitution.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/05/11/india.prostitution.children/index.html | work=CNN | title=Official: More than 1M child prostitutes in India – CNN.com | accessdate=22 May 2010 | date=11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] statement said that studies and surveys sponsored by the ministry of women and child development estimated that about 40% of all India's prostitutes are children.&lt;ref name="cnn.com" /&gt;

In Bangladesh, child prostitutes are known to take the drug Oradexon, also known as [[dexamethasone]]. This over-the-counter [[steroid]], usually used by farmers to fatten cattle, makes child prostitutes look larger and older. Charities say that 90% of prostitutes in the country's legalized brothels use the drug. According to social activists, the steroid can cause [[diabetes]], [[high blood pressure]] and is highly addictive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/19/us-bangladesh-prostitution-idUSBRE82I02A20120319 |title=Bangladesh's teenage brothels hold dark steroid secret|publisher=reuters.com|accessdate=20 March 2012|date=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/apr/05/sex-workers-bangladesh-steroid|title=A new danger for sex workers in Bangladesh|publisher=guardian.com|accessdate=20 March 2012|date=5 April 2010|location=London|first=Joanna|last=Moorhead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10173115|title=Bangladesh's dark brothel steroid secret|publisher=bbcnews.com|accessdate=20 March 2012|date=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thailand's Health System Research Institute reported that children in prostitution make up 40% of prostitutes in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicri.it/wwd/trafficking/minors/docs/dr_thailand.pdf |title=Desk Review: Trafficking in Minors for Commercial Sexual Exploitation; Thailand |format=PDF |accessdate=26 June 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606235116/http://www.unicri.it/wwd/trafficking/minors/docs/dr_thailand.pdf |archivedate=6 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Among the elderly===
Prostitution among the elderly is a phenomenon reported in [[South Korea]] where [[elderly]] people turn to prostitution to pay their bills. This problem comes about because the state does not provide enough income for necessities. Clients in Korea tend also to be elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Ng, Desmond (January 29, 2017) [http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/granny-prostitutes-reflect-south-korea-s-problem-of-elderly/3475610.html "Granny prostitutes reflect South Korea's problem of elderly poverty"] ''Channel NewsAsia''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Violence ===

Prostitution may sometimes be associated with illegal, abusive, and dangerous activities.

=== Human trafficking ===
{{Main|Human trafficking}}

Sex trafficking is defined as using coercion or force to transport an unwilling person into prostitution or other sexual exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Nick Davies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/oct/20/trafficking-numbers-women-exaggerated |title=Prostitution and trafficking – the anatomy of a moral panic |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=22 July 2012 |location=London |date=20 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations stated in 2009 that [[sex trafficking]] is the most commonly identified form of human trafficking and estimates that about 79% of human trafficking reported is for prostitution (although the study notes that this may be the result of statistical bias and that sex trafficking tends to receive the most attention and be the most visible).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2009 UN Report on TIP|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/Global_Report_on_TIP.pdf|accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex trafficking has been described by Kul Gautum, Deputy Executive Director of [[UNICEF]], as "the largest [[history of slavery|slave trade]] in history."&lt;ref name=bbcnews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2783655.stm |title=Asia's sex trade is 'slavery' |publisher=BBC News |date=20 February 2003 |accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the fastest growing [[organized crime|criminal industry]], predicted to outgrow drug trafficking.&lt;ref name=voa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2009-05-15-voa30-68815957.html?rss=human+rights+and+law |title=Experts encourage action against sex trafficking |publisher=Voice of America |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501101647/http://www.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2009-05-15-voa30-68815957.html?rss=human%2Brights%2Band%2Blaw |date=15 May 2009 |archivedate=1 May 2011 |accessdate=26 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ncpc.typepad.com/prevention_works_blog/2006/10/human_trafficki.html|title= Responding to Modern-Day Slavery|accessdate= |website= |date=20 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/2056662.stm|title=Human smuggling eclipses drug trade|publisher=bbcnews.com|date=20 June 2002 |accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there may be a higher number of people involved in [[slavery]] today than at any time in history, the proportion of the population is probably the smallest in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0901/p16s01-wogi.html |title=Slavery is not dead, just less recognizable |journal=Christian Science Monitor |date=1 September 2004 |accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|author=E.

“Annually, according to U.S. Government-sponsored research completed in 2006, approximately 800,000 people are trafficked across national borders, which does not include millions trafficked within their own countries. Approximately 80 percent of transnational victims are women and girls and up to 50 percent are minors," estimated the US Department of State in a 2008 study, in reference to the number of people estimated to be victims of all forms of human trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://womennewsnetwork.net/2008/12/05/lostdaughternepal808/ "Lost Daughters – An Ongoing Tragedy in Nepal"], Women News Network – WNN, 5 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Due in part to the illegal and underground nature of sex trafficking, the actual extent of women and children forced into prostitution is unknown. A statistical analysis of various measures of trafficking found that the legal status of prostitution did not have a significant impact on trafficking.&lt;ref name="Cho1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cho |first1=Seo-Young |date=2015 |title=Modeling for Determinants of Human Trafficking: An Empirical Analysis |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/socialinclusion/article/viewFile/125/pdf_12 |journal=Social Inclusion |volume=3 |issue=1 |access-date=2018-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children are sold into the global sex trade every year. Often they are kidnapped or orphaned, and sometimes they are sold by their own families. According to the International Labour Organization, the occurrence is especially common in places such as Thailand, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecpatusa.org/ |title=End Child Prostitution and Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes |publisher=Ecpat Usa |accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, forced labour generates an estimated $31 billion, about half of it in the industrialised world and around one tenth in transitional countries, according to the [[International Labour Organization]] in a report on forced labour ("A global alliance against forced labour", ILO, 11 May 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/standards/relm/ilc/ilc93/pdf/rep-i-b.pdf |title=A global alliance against forced labour |publisher=International Labour Office |accessdate=26 June 2012 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trafficking in people has been facilitated by factors such as porous borders and advanced communication technologies, and has become increasingly transnational in scope and highly financially lucrative.

The most common destinations for victims of human trafficking are Thailand, Japan, Israel, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Turkey and the US, according to a report by the UNODC ([[UN Office on Drugs and Crime]]).&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6497799.stm | work=BBC News | title=UN highlights human trafficking | date=26 March 2007 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major sources of trafficked persons include Thailand, China, Nigeria, Albania, Bulgaria, Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk" /&gt;

===Illicit uses===
{{see also|Extortion|Blackmail}}
Prostitution, often when it is illegal, is used in [[extortion]] and [[blackmail]], which always involves extortion, where the extortionist threatens to reveal information about a victim or their family members that is potentially embarrassing, socially damaging, or incriminating unless a demand for money, property, or services is met. The subject of the extortion may be manipulated into or voluntarily solicit the use of prostitution which is then later used to extort money or for profit otherwise. The film ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' famously depicts the role of Senator Geary who is implicated in the use of prostitution in order to gain his compliance on political issues.

== Types ==
[[File:10.3010 Torino-nightlife.v2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|A street prostitute talking to a potential customer in [[Torino]], Italy, 2005]]

=== Street ===
{{Main|Street prostitution}}
In street prostitution, the prostitute solicits customers while waiting at street corners, sometimes called "the track" by [[pimp]]s and prostitutes alike.  They usually dress in skimpy, provocative clothing, regardless of the weather.  Street prostitutes are often called "streetwalkers" while their customers are referred to as "tricks" or "johns." Servicing the customers is described as "turning tricks." The sex is usually performed in the customer's car, in a nearby alley, or in a rented room.  Motels and hotels that accommodate prostitutes commonly rent rooms by the half or full hour.

In Russia and other countries of the [[Soviet Union|former USSR]], prostitution takes the form of an open-air market. One prostitute stands by a roadside, and directs cars to a so-called "tochka" (usually located in alleyways or carparks), where lines of women are paraded for customers in front of their car headlights. The client selects a prostitute, whom he takes away in his car. Prevalent in the late 1990s, this type of service has been steadily declining in recent years.

A "lot lizard" is a commonly encountered special case of street prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://traffickingresourcecenter.org/sites/default/files/Sex%20Trafficking%20at%20Truck%20Stops%20AAG.pdf |title=Sex Trafficking At Truck Stops |format=PDF |publisher=[[Polaris Project]] |website=[[National Human Trafficking Resource Center]] |access-date=12 August 2018 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lot lizards mainly serve those in the [[Semi-trailer truck|trucking industry]] at [[truck stop]]s and stopping centers. Prostitutes will often proposition [[trucker]]s using a [[CB radio]] from a vehicle parked in the non-commercial section of a truck stop parking lot, communicating through codes based on commercial driving slang, then join the driver in his truck.

[[File:Soi Cowboy night.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|[[Soi Cowboy]], a [[red-light district]] in [[Bangkok]]]]

=== Brothels ===
{{Main|Brothel|Red-light district}}

[[Brothel]]s are establishments specifically dedicated to prostitution, often confined to special [[red-light district]]s in big cities. Other names for brothels include ''bordello'', ''whorehouse'', ''cathouse'', ''knocking shop'', and ''general houses''. Prostitution also occurs in some [[massage]] [[Massage parlor|parlours]], and in Asian countries in some [[barber]] shops where sexual services may be offered as a secondary function of the premises.

=== Escorts ===
[[File:Phone box prostitute calling cards 1 crop.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tart card]]s in a British [[telephone booth|phone box]] advertising the services of [[call girl]]s]]
{{Main|Call girl|Escort agency}}

Escort services may be distinguished from prostitution or other forms of prostitution in that sexual activities are often not explicitly advertised as necessarily included in these services; rather, payment is often noted as being for an escort's time and companionship only, although there is often an implicit assumption that sexual activities are expected.

In escort prostitution, the act takes place at the customer's residence or hotel room (referred to as out-call), or at the escort's residence or in a hotel room rented for the occasion by the escort (called in-call). The prostitute may be independent or working under the auspices of an [[escort agency]]. Services may be advertised over the Internet, in regional publications, or in local telephone listings.

Use of the Internet by prostitutes and customers is common.{{sfn|Siegel|2007| }} A prostitute may use adult boards or create a website of their own with contact details, such as email addresses. Adult contact sites, chats and on-line communities are also used. This, in turn, has brought increased scrutiny from law enforcement, public officials, and activist groups toward online prostitution. In 2009, [[Craigslist]] came under fire for its role in facilitating online prostitution, and was sued by some 40 US state attorneys general, local prosecutors, and law enforcement officials.

Reviews of the services of individual prostitutes can often be found at various escort review boards worldwide. These [[online forum]]s are used to trade information between potential clients, and also by prostitutes to advertise the various services available. Sex workers, in turn, often use online forums of their own to exchange information on clients, particularly to warn others about dangerous clients.

=== Sex tourism ===
{{Main|Sex tourism|Child sex tourism}}
[[Sex tourism]] is travel for [[sexual intercourse]] with prostitutes or to engage in other sexual activity. The [[World Tourism Organization]], a specialized agency of the United Nations defines sex tourism as "trips organized from within the tourism sector, or from outside this sector but using its structures and networks, with the primary purpose of effecting a commercial sexual relationship by the tourist with residents at the destination".&lt;ref name="WTO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-tourism.org/protect_children/statements/wto_a.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010061925/http://www.world-tourism.org/protect_children/statements/wto_a.htm|title=WTO Statement on the Prevention of Organised Sex Tourism|archive-date=10 October 2006|date=22 October 1995|publisher=World Tourism Organization|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As opposed to regular sex tourism, which is often legal, a tourist who has sex with a [[Prostitution of children|child prostitute]] will usually be committing a crime in the host country, under the laws of his own country (notwithstanding him being outside of it) and against international law. Child sex tourism (CST) is defined as a travel to a foreign country for the purpose of engaging in commercially facilitated [[child sexual abuse]].&lt;ref name=deptstate&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/fs/08/112090.htm|title=The Facts About Child Sex Tourism|website=Fact Sheet|publisher= US Dept of State, Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons|date=29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thailand, Cambodia, India, Brazil, and Mexico have been identified as leading hotspots of child sexual exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38872 |title=RIGHTS-MEXICO: 16,000 Victims of Child Sexual Exploitation – IPS |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date=13 August 2007 |accessdate=23 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326111520/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38872 |archivedate=26 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Virtual sex ===
[[Virtual sex]], that is, sexual acts conveyed by messages rather than physically, is also the subject of commercial transactions. Commercial [[phone sex]] services have been available for decades. The advent of the Internet has made other forms of virtual sex available for money, including computer-mediated [[cybersex]], in which sexual services are provided in text form by way of [[chat room]]s or [[instant messaging]], or audiovisually through a [[webcam]] (see [[camgirl]]).

According to the paper "Estimating the prevalence and career longevity of prostitute women",{{sfn|Potterat|Woodhouse|Muth|Muth|1990| }} the number of full-time equivalent prostitutes in a typical area in the United States (Colorado Springs, CO, during 1970–1988) is estimated at 23 per 100,000 population (0.023%), of which some 4% were under 18. The length of these prostitutes' working careers was estimated at a mean of 5 years. According to a 2012 report by ''Fondation Scelles'' there are between 40 and 42 million prostitutes in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=There Are 42 Million Prostitutes In The World, And Here's Where They Live|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/there-are-42-million-prostitutes-in-the-world-and-heres-where-they-live-2012-1?IR=T|author=Gus Lubin|date=17 January 2012|newspaper=Business Insider|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, it was estimated that in [[Amsterdam]], one woman in 35 was working as a prostitute, compared to one in 300 in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/front/Window_ban_for_Zurich_s_prostitutes.html?siteSect=107&amp;sid=1853267&amp;cKey=1052980380000&amp;ty=st |title=Window ban for Zurich's prostitutes |publisher=swissinfo |date=15 May 2003 |accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a 2004 TNS poll reported 15% of all men admitted to having paid for sex at least once in their life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/News/story?id=156921&amp;page=1|author=Gary Langer, with Cheryl Arnedt and Dalia Sussman|title=Primetime Live Poll: American Sex Survey|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=21 October 2004|accessdate=28 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a paper entitled "Prostitution and the sex discrepancy in reported number of sexual partners" concluded that men's self-reporting of prostitutes as sexual partners provides a serious underestimate.{{sfn|Brewer|Potterat|Garrett|2000|pp=12385–12388}}

In Australia, a survey conducted in the early 2000s showed that 15.6% of men aged 16–59 reported paying for sex at least once in their life, and 1.9% had done so in the past year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-842X.2003.tb00807.x|title=Sex in Australia: Experiences of commercial sex in a representative sample of adults|first5=Anthony M.A.|last5=Smith|first4=Richard O.|last4=Visser|first3=Andrew E.|last3=Grulich|first2=Juliet|year=2003|last2=Richters|last1=Rissel|first1=Chris E.|journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health|volume=27|ref=harv|pmid=14696710|issue=2|pages=191–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports disagree on whether prostitution levels are growing or declining in [[developed countries]]. Some studies indicate that the percentage of men engaging in commercial sex in the United States has declined significantly in recent decades: in 1964, an estimated 69–80% of men had paid for sex at least once.&lt;ref name=ProCon /&gt; Some have suggested that prostitution levels have fallen in sexually liberal countries, most likely because of the increased availability of non-commercial, non-marital sex&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Edlund |first1=Lena |last2=Korn |first2=Evelyn |title=A Theory of Prostitution |journal=Journal of Political Economy |date=February 2002 |volume=110 |issue=1 |pages=181–214 |doi=10.1086/324390 |url=http://www.iies.su.se/seminars/papers/Edlund.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526010007/http://www.iies.su.se/seminars/papers/Edlund.pdf|archive-date=26 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, for example in Sweden, because of stricter legal penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skarhead|first=Anna|title=Evaluating the Swedish Ban on the Purchase of Sexual Services: The Anna Skarhed Report|url=http://nppr.se/2010/07/02/evaluating-the-swedish-ban-on-the-purchase-of-sexual-services-the-anna-skarhed-report/|publisher=Nordic Prostitution Policy Reform|accessdate=26 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709082031/http://nppr.se/2010/07/02/evaluating-the-swedish-ban-on-the-purchase-of-sexual-services-the-anna-skarhed-report/|archivedate=9 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports suggest a growth in prostitution levels, for example in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bennetts|first=Leslie|title=The John Next Door|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/07/17/the-growing-demand-for-prostitution.html|website=2011|publisher=The Daily Beast|accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where again, sexual liberalisation is suggested as the cause. As Norma Ramos, Executive Director of the [[Coalition Against Trafficking in Women]] says "The more the commercial [[sex industry]] normalizes this behavior, the more of this behavior you get".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CATW submission to the OCHR Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/cedaw_crc_contributions/CoalitionagainstTraffickinginWomen.pdf|publisher=[[CATW]]|accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostitutes have long plied their trades to the military in many cultures.  For example, the British naval port of [[Portsmouth]] had a flourishing local sex industry in the 19th century, and until the early 1990s there were large [[red-light district]]s near American military bases in the Philippines. The notorious [[Patpong]] entertainment district in [[Bangkok]], Thailand, started as an [[R&amp;R (military)|R&amp;R]] location for US troops serving in the [[Vietnam War]] in the early 1970s. Washington D.C. itself had [[Murder Bay]] which attracted the military of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The village of [[Vadia (Banaskantha)|Vadia]], India is known locally as the ''village of prostitutes'', where unmarried women are involved in prostitution. Mass weddings for children of prostitutes in the village are held to protect them from being pushed into prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In pictures: Mass wedding in India 'prostitute village'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-17336512|work=BBC|date=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical situation ==
In some places, prostitution may be associated with the spread of [[sexually transmitted diseases]] (STDs). Lack of condom use among prostitutes and their clients has been cited as a factor in the spread of HIV in Asia: "One of the main reasons for the rapid spread of HIV in Asian countries is the massive transmission among sex workers and clients".&lt;ref name=Rojanap /&gt;  As a result, prevention campaigns aimed at increasing condom use by sex workers have been attributed to play a major role in restricting the spread of HIV.&lt;ref name=AVERTHIVSexWorkers&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.avert.org/sex-workers.htm | title = HIV Prevention and Sex Workers | accessdate= 15 September 2009| date = 2015-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the sources for the spread of HIV in Africa is prostitution, with one study finding that encounters with prostitutes produced 84% of new HIV infections in adult males in Accra, Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Côté AM, Sobela F, Dzokoto A |title=Transactional sex is the driving force in the dynamics of HIV in Accra, Ghana |journal=AIDS |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=917–25 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15060439 |doi= 10.1097/00002030-200404090-00009|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0269-9370&amp;volume=18&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=917 |ref=harv|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of HIV from urban settings to rural areas in Africa has been attributed to the mobility of farmers who visit sex workers in cities, for example in Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shabbir I, Larson CP |title=Urban to rural routes of HIV infection spread in Ethiopia |journal=J Trop Med Hyg |volume=98 |issue=5 |pages=338–42 |date=October 1995 |pmid=7563263 |doi= |url= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some studies of prostitution in urban settings in developing countries, such as Kenya, have stated that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=D'Costa LJ, Plummer FA, Bowmer I |title=Prostitutes are a major reservoir of sexually transmitted diseases in Nairobi, Kenya |journal=Sex Transm Dis |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=64–7 |year=1985 |pmid=4002094 |doi= 10.1097/00007435-198504000-00002|url= |ref=harv|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical responses to the problem are:
* banning prostitution completely
* introducing a system of [[Licensure|registration]] for prostitutes that mandates health checks and other public health measures
* educating prostitutes and their clients to encourage the use of [[barrier contraception]] and greater interaction with health care

Some think that the first two measures are counter-productive. Banning prostitution tends to drive it underground, making safe sex promotion, treatment and monitoring more difficult. Registering prostitutes makes the state complicit in prostitution and does not address the health risks of unregistered prostitutes. Both of the last two measures can be viewed as [[harm reduction]] policies.

In countries and areas where safer sex precautions are either unavailable or not practiced for cultural reasons, prostitution is an active disease vector for all STDs, including [[HIV]]/AIDS, but the encouragement of [[safer sex]] practices, combined with regular testing for sexually transmitted diseases, has been very successful when applied consistently. As an example, Thailand's condom program has been largely responsible for the country's progress against the HIV epidemic.&lt;ref name=Rojanap&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rojanapithayakorn W |title=The 100% condom use programme in Asia |journal=Reprod Health Matters |volume=14 |issue=28 |pages=41–52 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17101421 |doi=10.1016/S0968-8080(06)28270-3 |url= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that successful implementation of safe sex practices in India "would drive the [HIV] epidemic to extinction" while similar measures could achieve a 50% reduction in Botswana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nagelkerke NJ, Jha P, de Vlas SJ |title=Modelling HIV/AIDS epidemics in Botswana and India: impact of interventions to prevent transmission |journal=Bull.

'''Psychographics''' is a qualitative methodology used to describe consumers on psychological attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wells|first=William D.|date=May 1975|title=Psychographics: A critical review|jstor=3150443|journal=Journal of Marketing Research|volume=12|pages=196–213|doi=10.2307/3150443}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychographics have been applied to the study of [[personality]], values, [[opinions]], [[Attitudes (psychology)|attitudes]], [[self-interest|interests]], and lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Jairo Senise | title = Who Is Your Next Customer?
  | journal = Booz Allen Hamilton Inc, Strategy+Business
  | date = 28 September 2007
  | url =http://www.strategy-business.com/press/enewsarticle/enews092807}}&lt;/ref&gt; While psychographics are often equated with lifestyle research, it has been argued{{who|date=October 2017}} that psychographics should apply to the study of cognitive attributes such as attitudes, interests, opinions, and beliefs while lifestyle should apply to the study of overt behavior (e.g., activities).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson Jr|first=Thomas W.|last2=Golden|first2=Linda L.|date=1984|title=Lifestyle and psychographics: A critical review and recommendation.|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&amp;profile=ehost&amp;scope=site&amp;authtype=crawler&amp;jrnl=00989258&amp;AN=6434172&amp;h=CIsX9Zir8%2b8NXi2BVIt1%2ffswaNv5juoKSAJqetpjmxf4Khxm%2fZCptEMhYQr3%2bMVxLq9TwmulOd3X3PhafMUluA%3d%3d&amp;crl=c&amp;resultNs=AdminWebAuth&amp;resultLocal=ErrCrlNotAuth&amp;crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d00989258%26AN%3d6434172|journal=Advances in Consumer Research|volume=11|pages=405–411|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because this area of research focuses on activities, interests, and opinions, psychographic factors are sometimes abbreviated to 'AIO variables'.

==Use==
Psychographic studies of individuals or communities can be valuable in the fields of [[marketing]], [[Demographic profile|demographics]], opinion research, prediction, and [[social studies|social research]] in general. Psychographic attributes can be contrasted with demographic variables (such as age and gender), behavioral variables (such as purchase data or usage rate), and organizational descriptors (sometimes called [[firmographics|firmographic]] variables), such as industry, number of employees, and functional area.

Psychographic methods gained prominence in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 US presidential election]] due to its use in [[microtargeting]] advertisements to narrow constituencies by [[Cambridge Analytica]].&lt;!-- Is the horse's mouth a valid cite? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8Dd5aVXLCc --&gt;

==Comparison to demographics==
Psychographics is often confused with [[demographic profile|demographics]], where historical generations may be defined both by demographics, such as the years in which a particular generation is born or even the fertility rates of that generation's parents, but also by psychographic variables like attitudes, personality formation, and cultural touchstones. For example, the traditional approaches to defining the [[Baby Boom Generation]] or [[Generation X]] or [[Millennials]] have relied on both demographic variables (classifying individuals based on birth years) and psychographic variables (such as beliefs, attitudes, values and behaviors).

[[Infusionsoft]] published an article arguing than customer psychographic segmentation is more useful than demographic information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Psychographic profiling==
When a relatively complete profile of a person or group's psychographic make-up is constructed, this is called a "psychographic profile". Psychographic profiles are used in [[market segmentation]] as well as in [[advertising]]. Some categories of psychographic factors used in market segmentation include:
* activity, interest, opinion (AIOs)
* attitudes
* [[values]]
* behavior

Psychographic can also be seen as an equivalent of the concept of "culture" when it is used for segmentation at a national level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://learn.infusionsoft.com/marketing/email-marketing/why-psychographic-segmentation-is-important/|title=Why Psychographic Segmentation is Important|last=Saunders|first=Amy|date=2016-05-09|work=Infusionsoft.com|access-date=2018-03-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4680">'''Research Committee on Sociology of Law''' (RCSL) was established in 1962 by [[William M. Evan]] ([[University of Pennsylvania]]) and [[Adam Podgórecki]] ([[University of Warsaw]]), with the support of [[Renato Treves]] ([[University of Milan]]) during the Congress of the [[International Sociological Association]] (ISA), which was held in Weshington D. C. Treves was elected as the first president of the RCSL, Podgórecki as the vice-president and Evan as the Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_intro.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The RCSL aimed at "opening up a broader
range of opportunities for the participation of individual members in the activities of
the Association in the field of [[sociology of law]]".&lt;ref&gt;The RCSL Statutes (as modified in July 2009) are available at http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_Statutes_2009.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

The RCSL was initially formed as a largely informal forum to encourage and facilitate exchanges between sociologists of law from different countries. A Board was created in 1968, formal by-laws were adopted in 1973, and regular election were organised once every fourth year.&lt;ref&gt;The RCSL Statutes (as modified in July 2009) are available at http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_Statutes_2009.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The RCSL also holds annual meetings, occasionally together with other similar associations such as the Law and Society Associations or the Socio-Legal Studies Association.&lt;ref&gt;See the editoria by Johannes Feest, on the 40th anniversary of RCSL in RCSL Newsletter, Summer Issue 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The annual meetings are often devoted to specific theoretical and methodological themes, but space is reserved for organising sessions on general topics. The selection of themes and the call for papers are the responsibility of the RCSL Board and is carried out in cooperation with the local organising committee. The RCSL Board encourages countries not represented by its Board members to participate and to submit suggestions for organising its annual meetings.

Since the late 1960s, RCSL has supported the formation of permanent Working Groups, which focus on various research areas such as Comparative Studies of Legal Professions, Social and Legal Systems, Comparative Legal Cultures, Gender, Law and Politics, Law and Urban Space, Family and Human Rights, in order to promote research in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;For a complete list of Working Groups see: http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_wg.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 December 1988, the RCSL signed an agreement with Government of the Basque Country creating the [[International Institute for the Sociology of Law]] in [[Oñati]] which is located in the province of [[Guipúzcoa]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] in the north of [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;See RCSL, ''30 Years for the Sociology of Law'', Oñati, IISL, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:University Onate.JPG|right|thumb|The University of Oñati which houses the International Institute for the Sociology of Law.]]

Since its establishment in 1962, the RCSL has contributed to the development of the [[Sociology of law]] by systematically promoting social scientific research about law, legal institutions and legal systems. For more information see the section on [[Sociology of law]] and the [[International Institute for the Sociology of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;For a worldwide overview of socio-legal scholarship, produced in the late 1980s, see Ferrari, Vincenzo (ed.), ''Developing Sociology of Law. A World-Wide Documentary Enquiry'', Milano, Giuffré, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Masayuki Murayama (Japan) is currently the President of the RCSL. Previous Presidents include Vittorio Olgiati (Italy), Anne Boigeol (France), [[Lawrence Friedman]] (Stanford, USA), Johannes Feest (Bremen, Germany), Rogelio Perez Perdomo (IESA, Caracas, Venezuela), Mavis Maclean (Oxford, UK), Vincenzo Ferrari (Degli Studi Milano, Italy), Jean van Houtte (Belgian), Jan Glastra Van Loon (the Netherlands) and Renato Treves (Italy).

'''Adam Podgórecki Prize'''

"In honour and memory of the lifetime achievements of [[Adam Podgórecki]] and his place in the history of RCSL, the Board of RCSL established the annual RCSL Adam Podgórecki Prize at its meeting in 2004. The Prize is awarded for outstanding achievements in socio-legal research, either in the form of distinguished and outstanding lifetime achievements in one year or in the form of outstanding scholarship of a socio-legal researcher at an earlier stage of his or her career, in the next year of the award."&lt;ref&gt;For more information see ee http://www.isa-sociology.org/rc12_prize.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences''' ({{lang-fr|École des hautes études en sciences sociales}}; also known as '''EHESS''') is a [[France|French]] ''[[grandes écoles|grande école]]'' (élite higher-education establishment that operates outside the regulatory framework of the public university system) specialised in the social sciences and an associated college of [[PSL Research University|'''Université PSL''']].

Originally a department of the [[École Pratique des Hautes Études]], an institution created in 1868 with the purpose of training academic researchers, the EHESS became an independent institution in 1975. Today its research covers the fields of Economics and Finance (through the [[Paris School of Economics]]), [[Cognitive science|Cognitive Sciences]], [[Humanities]], [[Political science|Political Sciences]], [[Applied mathematics|Applied Mathematics]] and [[Statistics]], [[Development studies]], [[Sociology]], [[Anthropology]], [[History]], [[Musicology]], and [[Philosophy of social science]].

The institution is concentrated on scholarly research and some of its faculty (known as "directeurs d'études") have achieved international recognition in different areas: economics, [[Thomas Piketty]] and [[Nobel Prize]] [[Jean Tirole]]; historians such as [[Fernand Braudel]] and [[Lucien Febvre]]; anthropologists such as [[Claude Levi-Strauss]], [[Eduardo Viveiros de Castro]] and [[Marcel Mauss]], sociologists such as [[Pierre Bourdieu]], [[Edgar Morin]] and [[Alain Touraine]]; philosophers such as [[Jacques Derrida]], and interdisciplinary scholars such as [[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Raymond Aron]].&lt;br&gt; As a higher education institution under the jurisdiction of the [[France|French]] [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Ministry of Education]], the EHESS trains academic researchers and professors specialised in the [[social sciences]]. It awards graduate degrees, such as the [[master of research]] and the [[doctorate]], as well as a school [[diploma]]. Some of them are awarded conjointly with nstitutions such as the [[École Normale Supérieure]], the [[École Polytechnique]], the [[École pratique des hautes études]], and some of the [[University of Paris#Successors and legacy|universities of Paris]].

The EHESS is a grande école and, as such, is not part of the mainstream university system. It evaluates students through a selection process based on the research project of the applicants. The scholars in training are free to choose their own curriculum among the large quantity of seminars offered by the school. The école has a small student-faculty ratio (830 researchers for 3000 students). Most faculty belong to other institutions, mostly within the [[CNRS]] but also other schools of [[PSL Research University|Université PSL]] such as the [[École normale supérieure|ENS]], the [[EPHE]] and the [[École des Chartes|ENC]], schools of [[Université Paris-Saclay]] such as [[Télécom Paristech]] and the [[École Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Économique|ENSAE]], and some of the [[University of Paris#Successors and legacy|universities of Paris]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==History==
===École pratique des hautes études=== 
Originally part of the [[École pratique des hautes études]] (EPHE) as its ''VI Section: Sciences économiques et sociales'', the EHESS gained autonomy as an independent higher education institution on 23 January 1975. The creation of a dedicated branch for social science research within the EPHE was catalyzed by the ''[[Annales School|Annales]]'' historical school and was supported by several academic initiatives of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], dating to the 1920s. After WWII, the Rockefeller Foundation invested more funds in French institutions, seeking to encourage non-Marxist sociological studies.

The VIth section was created in 1947, and [[Lucien Febvre]] took its head. Soon after its creation (1947), the ''VI Section'', later EHESS, became one of the most influential shapers of contemporary [[historiography]], [[area studies]] and [[social sciences]] methodology, thanks to the contribution of eminent scholars such as [[Fernand Braudel]], [[Jacques Le Goff]] and [[François Furet]]. F. Braudel succeeded L. Febvre in 1956. He concentrated the various study groups at the well-known building on [[boulevard Raspail]], in part by financing from the [[Ford Foundation]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===Independent institution===
Today, the EHESS is one of France's ''Grands établissements''. It functions as a [[research]], [[higher education|teaching]], and degree-granting institution. It offers advanced students high-level programs intended to lead to research careers. Students are admitted on the relevance of their research project and undertake at the EHESS [[master's degree|master programs]] and [[doctorate|doctoral studies]]. The main areas of specialization include: [[history]], [[literary theory]], [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[philology]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[cognitive science]], [[demographics]], [[geography]], [[archaeology]], [[psychology]], [[law]], and [[mathematics]]. The  institution's focus is on [[interdisciplinary]] research within these fields. The EHESS has more than 80 research centers (among which are several joint research units with the [[CNRS]]) and 22 doctoral programs, 13 of which are in partnership with other French [[List of universities in France|Universities]] and ''[[Grandes écoles]]''.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===PSL Research University===
The school is a constituent college of the federal [[PSL Research University]]. Other institutions include the [[College de France]], the [[École Normale Supérieure]], the [[École pratique des hautes études]], [[Chimie ParisTech]], [[ESPCI ParisTech]], the [[École des mines]], and [[Paris Dauphine University]].

==Research==
{{Expand section|date=January 2017}}

===History ===
====Influence from the Annales School====
[[Lucien Febvre]] and [[Fernand Braudel]] were members of the [[Annales School|École des Annales]], the dominant school of historical analysis in France during the [[interwar period]]. However, this school of thought was contested by the growing importance of the social sciences and the beginning of [[structuralism]]. Under pressure from [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], in particular, they integrated new contributions from the fields of [[sociology]] and [[ethnography]] to event-based historical analysis, a concept put forward by the Annales school, to advocate for the concept of "a nearly imperceptible passage of history". They were reproached, along with the structuralists, for ignoring [[politics]] and the individual's influence over his fate during a period in which the colonial wars of liberation were taking place.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

The work of [[Braudel]], [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie|Le Roy Ladurie]] and other historians working under their influence greatly affected the research and official teaching of history in France beginning in the 1960s. The work of [[Jean-Marie Pesez]] renewed interest in the issue of methodology in medieval archeology and created the idea of "material culture".{{cn|date=July 2018}}

====New History====
During the 1970s, EHESS became the center of [[Nouvelle histoire|New History]] under the influence of [[Jacques Le Goff]] and [[Pierre Nora]]. During this period, a generation of ethnologists working under the ideas of [[Georges Balandier]] and [[Marc Augé]] were critical of the French colonial tradition and applied modern sociological concepts to third world countries.

===Sociology===
[[Pierre Bourdieu]], [[Luc Boltanski]], [[Alain Touraine]], [[Jean-Claude Passeron]] have all been associated with EHESS.

===Economics===
EHESS has always been a central place for economic debate in Europe. In France this debate is also enabled by the proximity of the researchers in Paris with national economic institutions: In this sense EHESS's advisors who have been drawn from economic professors have enjoyed a large media audience (a case example was [[Jean Fourastié]]). The diversity of viewpoints has been a priority, and liberal and Marxist economists have had the chance to debate in EHESS. Since the 1970s and 1980s EHESS has focused on quantitative economics, with classes led by well-known professors such as Louis-André Gérard-Varet, Jean-Jacques Laffont, François Bourguignon and Roger Guesnerie. They initiated not only the Paris School of Economics but the Toulouse School of Economics and Grequam (Aix-Marseille).

==Organisation==
{{Expand section|date=January 2017}}

===Recruitment===
More than 50% of the student body comes from countries other than France.&lt;!-- What is the proportion within the EU and outside? Within metropolitan and territorial France? --&gt;

==Domestic and foreign networks==
{{Expand section|date=January 2017}}

===Affiliations===
The school is a founding member of the [[Paris School of Economics]], [[Toulouse School of Economics]], and Aix-Marseille School of Economics, the three French leading centers in [[Quantitative Economics]].

===International partnerships===
EHESS has exchange programs with universities such as Oxford and Cambridge, Charles in the UK, Berkeley, Columbia, Michigan, and Humboldt in the United States, Lomonossov in Russia, Tokyo and Kyoto in Japan, Peking, the European Institute in Florence, etc. Also, it has many relations and exchange programs with universities in Asia and the Middle-East; it holds research centers on Asian Studies and Islamic Studies.

'''Selin Balcı''' is a visual artist and biologist who creates works with [[Petri dish]]es filled with mold, fungi, and other organisms, and refers to her work as "a living studio."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://selinbalci.com/statement.html|title=STATEMENT|website=selinbalci.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has exhibited internationally in both group and solo exhibitions.

== Education ==
Balcı earned her Bachelor of Science in Forestry at [[Istanbul University]], Turkey, in 2002, and went on to earn a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Intermedia at [[West Virginia University]] in 2008. She received her Masters in Fine Arts from the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="selinbalci.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://selinbalci.com/cv.html|title=CV|website=selinbalci.com|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition ==
Balcı has been recognized with several fellowships, including an Artist in Residence fellowship at the [[Virginia Center for the Creative Arts]] in Amherst, VA, and a [[College Art Association]] Professional Development Fellowship. She was both a Hot Picks Artist (2012) and a Project Grant recipient (2014) at [[Smack Mellon]] in Brooklyn, NY,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smackmellon.org/index.php/contact/previous_studio_artists/|title=SmackMellon.org :: Previous Artists|website=smackmellon.org|language=en-EN|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has twice been named a finalist for the Trawick Prize&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bethesda.org/bethesda/trawick-prize|title=The Trawick Prize|website=www.bethesda.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Bethesda Contemporary Art Awards in Bethesda, MD for artists from the Washington, DC, Maryland, and Virginia area (2013 and 2015).&lt;ref name="selinbalci.com"/&gt; Balcı has been featured in several solo and two-person shows in the Washington, DC area, as well as in Maryland and in Istanbul. In 2017, her work was included in the show "Contemporary Artists from Turkey," at the Biennale Arcipelago Mediterraneo in Palermo, Italy. Her work in "Under the Scope" at the Silber Art Gallery of [[Goucher College]] in Towson, MD, was the subject of a 2014 [[Washington City Paper]] article.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/arts/museums-galleries/blog/13081187/the-mold-and-the-beautiful-how-selin-balci-makes-her-fungal-art|title=The Mold and the Beautiful: How Selin Balcı Makes Her Fungal Art|work=Washington City Paper|access-date=2017-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==
Balcı, trained in biology, finds her samples in tree bark and soil from her backyard, and sometimes collaborates with her plant pathologist husband for colorful natural material, and stores her specimens in the refrigerator in test tubes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In recent years, Balcı has moved from boards to framed works, and uses Yupo paper as a support, which can withstand the mold growth and emphasizes the texture of her medium.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After sterilizing her Yupo paper, she coats it in potato dextrose agar to feed the colonies, and waits one to two months for her composition to grow.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although she has used the term "living" to describe her works, she no longer exhibits living specimens—instead she allows them to dry out and prevents new growth with a layer of acrylic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Along with boards and frames, she has recently exhibited her works in Petri dishes arranged in shapes such as a map of the world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://selinbalci.com/Bordered%20World.html|title=BORDERED WORLD|website=selinbalci.com|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; or on Yupo paper covered with watch glasses to magnify certain elements of the growths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://selinbalci.com/Territory.html|title=TERRITORY|website=selinbalci.com|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balcı studies how microorganisms behave and relate to one another before beginning new projects, and is interested in how their interactions reflect conflicts and boundaries in the human world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.honfleurgallery.com/arena/|title=Arena {{!}} Honfleur Gallery|website=www.honfleurgallery.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shallow reading''' refers to social practices in which people acquire information or entertainment quickly from texts, images or other meaningful forms, individual or combination, by using various modern media. Shallow reading as a representational form of [[Postmodernism|post-modern]] [[Media culture|mass culture]] reflects a transition of expense principle tendency from [[print culture]] towards [[visual culture]].

== Background ==
With the continuous update of advanced media technology and popularization of [[Internet]], people are stepping into mobile Internet era shifting. In this process, an obvious change is that traditional reading mode is gradually shifting to shallow reading. The prevalence of shallow reading has attracted attention of media, publishing and library fields.

== Features ==
'''1. Superficial'''

In order to enable people obtain useful information during the process of quick browsing, the target materials of shallow reading are usually very clear and easy to understand as well as with clear-cut topics.

'''2. Visual'''

Objectives of shallow reading are often short texts with illustrations and pictures even images and/or video without text captions.

'''3. Recreational'''

For deep readers, traditional reading is a process of thinking training and a cultivation of aesthetic culture while Shallow reading gets rid of the seriousness of deep reading and mainly aim at facilitating readers acquire information and entertainment in a relaxing and interactive atmosphere.

A '''slow movement''' is a form in a multi-[[Movement (music)|movement]] musical piece. Generally, the second movement of a piece will be written as a slow movement, although composers occasionally write other movements as a slow movement as well. The tempo of a slow movement can vary from largo to andante. It is usually in the [[dominant key|dominant]], [[subdominant]], [[parallel key|parallel]], or [[relative key|relative]] key of the musical work's main key.

== Overview ==
The general layout of a four-movement piece is as follows:

# A fast movement, written in [[sonata form]]
# A slow movement
# A [[minuet]] or [[scherzo]]
# A faster movement, usually a [[rondo]]

However, composers sometimes remove, add or re-arrange movements, such as Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, which begins with the slow movement. When a piece has additional movements, they may also be written as a slow movement.

== Form ==
A slow movement is usually written in one of three forms: [[Ternary form|compound or "large" ternary]], sonata form without development, and [[Variation (music)|theme and variations]].

=== Large ternary ===
Large ternary is the most common form used for a slow movement. It consists of three parts, labeled ABA. The first and third part are almost identical, whereas the middle part is contrasting.
If the starting key is a major key, the middle part is typically written in a minor key; if the starting key is a minor key, the middle part is typically written in a major key. The keys do not have to have the same tonic. If the middle part is written in a major key, it is often labeled Maggiore. If it is written in a minor key, then it is labeled Minore.
The final part is always a return of the first part, but frequently has additional ornaments and small phrases added on.

=== Sonata form without development ===
Sonata form without development is a variant of sonata form where the development is omitted, leaving only the exposition and recapitulation.  This form is also known as [[Sonatina]] form.  As written above, in Sonatina form, there is no development section, but rather a dominant-seventh chord between the exposition and the recapitulation that prepares for the recapitulation and the tonic key.  One example of the piece in sonata form without development is the second movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 17, "The Tempest".

=== Theme and variations ===
Theme and [[Variations (music)|variations]] form starts with a theme, followed by multiple variations. This theme is usually eight to thirty-two bars in length, and may be constructed as a musical sentence,  period, or small ternary. Each variation is a recurrence of the theme with melodic, harmonic, rhythmic and ornamental changes.

Theme and variations sometimes contain one "minore" variation. This variation will have a contrasting tonality, and may be different in form from the theme.

Theme and variations may also have a coda to finalize the piece. It may bring back the original theme with few or no changes, in order to create symmetry.

'''Swami Sundaranand''' (born April, 1926 near Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, India) is a [[Yogi]], [[photographer]], [[author]] and [[mountaineer]] who lectures widely in [[India]] on threats to the [[Ganges River]] and the loss of [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] [[glacier]]s due to [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/now/shows/430/india-journal5.html|title=Gangotri: The Clicking Swami|last=Brancaccio|first=David|author2=photographs by John Siceloff |date=2008-08-01|work=NOW|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hindi.webdunia.com/regional-hindi-news/%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%A6-%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%96%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8-%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B-%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0-110011900068_1.htm|date=18 July 2015|title=(Amjad Ali Khan Saraswati Award)|publisher=WebDunia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020113/spectrum/main1.htm|date=13 January 2002|title=Celestial Peaks, Divine Grandeur: The Himalayas through the lens of a sadhu|publisher=Sunday Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sundarananda was a student of the reclusive [[yoga]] master Swami [[Tapovan Maharaj]] (1889–1957), who wrote in the late 19th and early 20th centuries about yogic life in the [[Himalayas]] in the classic yoga book ''Wanderings in the Himalayas'' (Himagiri Vihar).&lt;ref&gt;Wanderings in the Himalayas, English Edition, Published by Chinmaya Publication Trust, Madras-3, 1960, translated by T.N. Kesava Pillai, M.A.&lt;/ref&gt; Sundaranand lived with Swami Tapovan in the then inaccessible area of [[Gangotri]], at the source of the [[Ganges]], which is considered one of India's most sacred places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amarujala.com/news/city/uttarkashi/Uttar-Kashi-70739-17/|title=आर्ट गैलरी-ध्यान केंद्र बनवाने में जुटे स्वामी सुंदरानंद- Amarujala|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publicasia.in/newsDetails.php?Id=17466 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402100930/http://publicasia.in/newsDetails.php?Id=17466 |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1948, he has lived by the Ganges in Gangotri, at 10,400 feet, in a modest hut (''kuti'') which his master Swami Tapovan Maharaj later bequeathed to him on his death in 1957.  There, Swami Sundaranand has lived in solitude and through the severest of winters without any comforts or conveniences.&lt;ref&gt;Elixir Magazine, Spring 2006, page 87&lt;/ref&gt; He has witnessed up close the gradual shrinking of the [[Gangotri Glacier]] from which the Ganges springs forth, and has chronicled his devotion to the natural beauty of the Indian Himalayas as an accomplished photographer. A museum devoted to environmental protection and spiritual guidance, containing Swami Sundaranand's Himalayan photography, is now in the planning stages. It will be located in Gangotri on the property of Sundaranand and his master.

As an ascetic, he took the brahmacharya sadhu vow over 59 years ago and daily devotes his life to rigorous meditation and other spiritual practices. He continues to be a principal advocate for the ecological preservation of the Himalayas, the Ganges and its source at Gangotri.

He has taken more than 100,000 photos, over a 50-year period, of the shrinking Gangotri glacier in the Indian Himalayas. He now travels India raising awareness of the Gangotri's rapid decline.&lt;ref name="OurPlanet"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.unep.org/pdf/ourplanet/2007/may/en/op-2007-05-en-fullversion.pdf |title=Melting Ice: A Hot Topic, Climate Change and the Crysosphere |format=pdf |journal =Our Planet:The Magazine of the United Nations Environment Programme |date=May 2007| pages=4 |accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicknamed "the ''[[Sadhu]]'' Who Clicks" because of his photography, he is also a noted mountain climber, having scaled over 25 Himalayan peaks, and climbing twice with Sir [[Edmund Hillary]] and [[Tenzing Norgay]].&lt;ref name="csm"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0103/p07s02-sten.htm |title=Himalaya's receding glaciers suffer neglect &amp;#124; csmonitor.com |author=Janaki Kremmer |work=[[Christian Science Monitor]] | date=3 January 2007  |accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Edmund Hillary paid his respects to Swami Sundaranad in the 1980s at his [[Gangotri]] hut.&lt;ref&gt;Personal Time with Swami-ji, 157 mins Film, The Center for Healing Arts&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Gangotri glacier, Swami Sundaranand says:

Swami Sundaranand is the author of the book ''Himalaya: Through the Lens of a Sadhu'' with over 425 photographs spanning 60 years of his work.&lt;ref name="urlhimalaya-sundaranand"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.meaus.com/himalaya-sundaranand.htm |title=Book Review: HIMALAYA: THROUGH THE LENS OF A SADHU|author = B.

A lookout point and plaque have been built downriver from Gangotri and dedicated to the Swami's work and efforts.

Swami Sundaranand is the subject of a feature documentary shot at his home in Gangotri titled ''Personal Time with Swamiji''. The film was produced by [http://www.thecenterforhealingarts.com The Center for Healing Arts] and directed by [[Victor Demko]].

==Views on global warming==
Over the past six decades, Swami Sundaranand has used his combined interests to raise awareness about the Ganga. "When I first came to this region, it was one of the most beautiful part of the Himalayas," he says. "It is difficult to imagine the purity of the Ganga and the abundance of Himalayan vegetation and fauna that was prevalent then. We don't know what we have cruelly destroyed."

Swami Sundaranand has lived in Gangotri since 1948, when he became a renunciate, and arrived there from Andhra Pradesh. In his words: "A lot has changed since then. Although the air is cold here, the sun is harsh. It's becoming hotter every year. People say it is global warming. I say it is a global warning."

The pollution of Ganga in the plains has been an oft-repeated refrain, but, according to Sundaranand, a graver threat is its pollution at the source. He attributes this to the unchecked construction of hotels and ''ashrams'' in Gangotri and the dumping of waste from these locations, such as faecal matter and garbage, into the Ganga. According to him, "there are no environment lovers left here, only money lovers". Every year, while the temple town closes during the harsh winter months, unchecked construction and felling of trees is at its peak. According to the sadhu, "many bhoj trees in Bhojbasa, en route [[Gaumukh]] have been cut down. Earlier, on my treks to the Gaumukh glacier, I could spot rare animals like the snow leopard and musk deer. They are rarely visible now".

The sadhu is also an avid mountaineer — it was during his treks to the glacier over the last 10–15 years that he saw the glacier retreat more rapidly than ever before. According to him, Gaumukh was barely 1&amp;nbsp;km away from Bhojbasa, but today, it is 4&amp;nbsp;km away and that every year, the glacier was retreating by at least 10 metres. He has expreseed the view that the pollution of Ganga at its source and melting Himalayan glaciers were the real issues that environmentalists needed to urgently take up, rather than opposing the construction of dams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-times/deep-focus/The-sadhu-who-clicks/articleshow/8730692.cms|first=Atul |last=Sethi |publisher=Times of India|title=The sadhu who clicks|date=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Swami Sundaranand has a strong connection with the [[Himalayas]] that few others have. He has climbed dozens of its peaks, several of them over 21,000 feet above sea level, and has lectured at Tensing's Himalayan Institute (a famous mountaineering school). He is also a skilled [[naturalist]] that is familiar with thousands of Himalayan plants and he knows the lore and medicinal uses of these species.

He engages in 3 hours of meditation during the day, and may meditate at night into the early hours of the morning. The most important parts of his life are meditation, ''japa'' and ''pranayama''. As a younger man he was an accomplished ''hatha'' yogi, mastering 300 postures, and he continues to practice it daily. He is very devoted to the ecosystem in which he has lived for forty years and believes that "God does not reside in temples or mosques - he is scattered everywhere in the courtyard of nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=665|publisher=Hinduism Today|title=Swami Sundarananda, John Muir of the Himalayas|date=October 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=river /&gt;

'''Timing of CAB expression 1''' is a [[protein]] that in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' is encoded by the '''TOC1''' [[gene]].  TOC1 is also known as '''two-component response regulator-like APRR1'''.

TOC1 was the first plant gene that, when mutated, yielded a circadian phenotype. It codes for the [[transcription factor]] TOC1, which affects the period of plants' [[circadian rhythms]]: built-in, malleable oscillations that repeat every 24 hours. The gene codes for a transcriptional [[repressor]], TOC1, one of five pseudo-response regulators (PRR) that mediate the period of the circadian clock in plants. The TOC1 protein is involved in the clock's evening loop, which is a [[repressilator]] that directly inhibits transcription of morning loop genes [[LHY]] and [[CCA1]].&lt;ref name="Fujiwara"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fujiwara S, Wang L, Han L, Suh SS, Salomé PA, McClung CR, Somers DE | title = Post-translational regulation of the Arabidopsis circadian clock through selective proteolysis and phosphorylation of pseudo-response regulator proteins | journal = J.

== Historical context ==

=== Discovery ===

The TOC1 gene was initially discovered by Prof. Andrew Millar and colleagues in 1995 while Millar was a graduate student. Millar developed an innovative forward genetic screen in which he linked a [[bioluminescent]] reporter, firefly ([[luciferase]]), to expression of CAB (chlorophyll-a,b binding protein—see [[Light-harvesting complexes of green plants]]) in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana|Arabidopsis]]''. By measuring bioluminescence over the course of the day, Millar found CAB expression to display oscillatory patterns in constant light and to oscillate with a shorter period in toc1 mutant plants. He also mapped the toc1 gene to chromosome 5. These methods and discoveries were published in and featured on the cover of ''Science'' magazine in February 1995.&lt;ref name="Millar"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Millar AJ, Carré IA, Strayer CA, Chua NH, Kay SA | title = Circadian clock mutants in Arabidopsis identified by luciferase imaging | journal = Science | volume = 267 | issue = 5201 | pages = 1161–3 |date=February 1995 | pmid = 7855595 | doi =10.1126/science.7855595 | bibcode = 1995Sci...267.1161M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partially because the initial studies of clock genes were conducted in ''[[Drosophila]]'' in the 1970s and then in mammals, it was originally thought that the plant circadian clock functioned similarly to the mammalian clock. In mammals, positive and negative regulatory elements act in feedback loops to drive circadian oscillations; namely, Per and Cry genes are activated by positive elements CLOCK and BMAL to produce proteins that, when phosphorylated, act as negative elements to inhibit the CLOCK:BMAL complex from its activating function. In this way, Per and Cry inhibit their own transcription.&lt;ref name=Ko&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 |date=October 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23604473"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Buhr ED, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the Mammalian circadian clock | journal = Handb Exp Pharmacol | volume = 217 | issue = | pages = 3–27 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23604473 | doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-25950-0_1 | series = Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology | isbn = 978-3-642-25949-4 | pmc=3762864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Millar's group found the TOC1 protein to be a negative regulator, and the plant clock to be better modeled as a [[repressilator]]—a system in which one gene represses another and is in turn repressed by the next, forming an interdependent, oscillating gene network. This finding was achieved through 1) ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana|Arabidopsis]]'' mutants with constitutive (always turned on) toc1 [[gene expression]], which showed decreased mRNA abundance in both morning loop genes prr7 and 9, cca1, and lhy and evening loop genes gi and elf4; and 2) plants with mutations in toc1 and plants in which [[RNAi]] was used to knock out toc1. These mutants with no functional toc1 showed an advanced phase for lhy, suggesting less repression in the absence of TOC1 protein.&lt;ref name = "Huang"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Huang W, Pérez-García P, Pokhilko A, Millar AJ, Antoshechkin I, Riechmann JL, Mas P | title = Mapping the core of the Arabidopsis circadian clock defines the network structure of the oscillator | journal = Science | volume = 336 | issue = 6077 | pages = 75–9 |date=April 2012 | pmid = 22403178 | doi = 10.1126/science.1219075 |bibcode = 2012Sci...336...75H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Carl Strayer and colleagues found that toc1 gene's transcriptional involvement shortened circadian rhythms in constant dark in addition to constant light, and that TOC1 was circadianly regulated and involved in regulation of its own feedback loop.&lt;ref name = "Strayer"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Strayer C, Oyama T, Schultz TF, Raman R, Somers DE, Más P, Panda S, Kreps JA, Kay SA | title = Cloning of the Arabidopsis clock gene TOC1, an autoregulatory response regulator homolog | journal = Science | volume = 289 | issue = 5480 | pages = 768–71 |date=August 2000 | pmid = 10926537 | doi =10.1126/science.289.5480.768 | bibcode = 2000Sci...289..768S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary History===
* '''Homologs'''

Homologs of TOC1 have been found in Lyrate rockcress, [[Brassica]], [[papaya]], [[cucumber]], [[strawberry]], [[soybean]], [[lotus (genus)|lotus]], [[apple]], [[peach]], western poplar ([[populus]]), [[castor bean]], [[tomato]], [[potato]], [[grape vine]], and [[chickpea]].&lt;ref name="urlPlant Genome Duplication Database"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://chibba.agtec.uga.edu/duplication/index/locus_app?lc=AT5G61380 | title =  AT5G61380 Locus Search  | work = Plant Genome Duplication Database | publisher = University of Georgia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Polymorphisms'''

21 polymorphisms have been found in ''Arabidopsis'', including substitutions, insertions, and deletions.&lt;ref name="urlLocus Detail"/&gt;

== Protein characteristics ==

=== Structural motifs ===

Like the other four PRR proteins found in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana|Arabidopsis]]'', TOC1 is located in the nucleus and employs a pseudo-receiver (PR) [[Protein domain|domain]] in the [[N-terminus]] and a CONSTANS, CONSTANS-LIKE, and TOC1 (CCT) domain at the [[C-terminus]].&lt;ref name="Fujiwara"/&gt; Through its CCT domain, TOC1 is able to directly bind [[DNA]], and the PR domain is responsible for transcriptional repression activity.&lt;ref name="pmid22315425"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gendron JM, Pruneda-Paz JL, Doherty CJ, Gross AM, Kang SE, Kay SA | title = Arabidopsis circadian clock protein, TOC1, is a DNA-binding transcription factor | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 109 | issue = 8 | pages = 3167–72 |date=February 2012 | pmid = 22315425 | pmc = 3286946 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1200355109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..109.3167G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Functions and interactions ===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TOC1 interactions.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the morning (yellow) and evening (gray) circadian clock loops in ''Arabidopsis'', entrainable through light. Transcriptional regulation is shown through black lines and protein complexes are denoted by dashed black lines. Post-translational regulation is shown by dashed red lines. Light sensitive elements are denoted with lightning bolts and yellow circles.]] --&gt;

TOC1 binds to the G-box and EE-motif promoter regions of genes involved in both the morning and evening transcription-translation feedback loops that drive the plant circadian clock; these genes include PRR7 and 9, CCA1, and LHY in the morning feedback loop and GI and ELF4 in the evening loop. Discrete induction of TOC1 gene expression results in reduced CCA1 and PRR9 expression, indicating that TOC1 plays a repressive rather than stimulatory role in regulating circadian gene expression.&lt;ref name="Huang"/&gt; Repression of morning loop genes lhy and cca1 was predicted by computational modeling and was the piece of evidence needed to re-define toc1's role in the plant clock as part of a triple negative-component [[repressilator]] model rather than a positive/negative-element system of the sort seen in mammals.&lt;ref name="Pokhilko"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pokhilko A, Fernández AP, Edwards KD, Southern MM, Halliday KJ, Millar AJ | title = The clock gene circuit in Arabidopsis includes a repressilator with additional feedback loops | journal = Mol. Syst. Biol. | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 574 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22395476 | pmc = 3321525 | doi = 10.1038/msb.2012.6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The binding pattern of TOC1's CCT domain exhibits circadian oscillations, with maximum binding to G-box and EE motifs—promoter regions that bind transcription factors—occurring at CT15 in the plant's early subjective night.&lt;ref name="pmid22315425" /&gt; It was shown through the loss of binding rhythms in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana|Arabidopsis]]'' mutants with constitutive TOC1 expression that oscillations in TOC1 binding are regulated by the protein's abundance.&lt;ref name="Huang"/&gt;

TOC1 also appears to be involved in a feedback loop with [[abscisic acid]], a key plant hormone involved in development and stress response. '' Arabidopsis '' plants to which varying amounts of ABA were applied showed corresponding differences in TOC1 expression and in circadian period length. Through computational modeling of this feedback loop, TOC1 was shown to be a clock-based influence on patterns of [[stoma]] opening and closure, which has traditionally been described as a mainly ABA-regulated process.&lt;ref name="pmid23506153"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pokhilko A, Mas P, Millar AJ | title = Modelling the widespread effects of TOC1 signalling on the plant circadian clock and its outputs | journal = BMC Syst Biol | volume = 7| pages = 23 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23506153 | pmc = 3614443 | doi = 10.1186/1752-0509-7-23  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-translational modifications ===

Over the circadian cycle, TOC1 is differentially [[phosphorylated]], with peak phosphorylation occurring during the night.&lt;ref name="Fujiwara"/&gt; In the highly phosphorylated state, TOC1 has a higher binding affinity to the [[F-box protein]] ZEITLUPE (ZTL).&lt;ref name="Fujiwara"/&gt; In addition to controlling TOC1 - ZTL interactions, phosphorylation of the N-terminus of TOC1 protein increases interaction with PRR3, one of the five PRR proteins found in ''Arabidopsis''.&lt;ref name="Fujiwara"/&gt; From studies with ztl-1 mutants, which have a single [[missense mutation]] in the kelch domain of the protein and effectively cause a ztl [[null mutation]], TOC1 protein has been found to be stabilized and TOC1 cycling largely eliminated.&lt;ref name="Fujiwara"/&gt; While phosphorylation of TOC1 protein stabilizes interactions with ZTL, it also increases TOC1's affinity for PRR3.&lt;ref name="Fujiwara"/&gt; This ultimately protects TOC1 from ZTL-mediated degradation.&lt;ref name="Fujiwara"/&gt; PRR3 acts as a competitive inhibitor for the ZTL-TOC1 interaction, as binding of TOC1 to PRR3 results in decreased TOC1 substrate availability for ZTL-dependent degradation.&lt;ref name="Fujiwara"/&gt; This results in an enhanced amplitude of TOC1 cycling, implying that stable TOC1 cycling is dependent upon ZTL degradation in addition to transcriptional regulation controls.&lt;ref name="Fujiwara"/&gt;

== Agricultural use ==
To most efficiently use environmental resources such as light, plants generally synchronize their circadian rhythms to match the period of the environment. In a study published in 2005, it was shown that plants whose circadian period matched the period of the light-dark cycle in its environment had increased photosynthesis and growth.&lt;ref name="pmid16040710"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dodd AN, Salathia N, Hall A, Kévei E, Tóth R, Nagy F, Hibberd JM, Millar AJ, Webb AA | title = Plant circadian clocks increase photosynthesis, growth, survival, and competitive advantage | journal = Science | volume = 309 | issue = 5734 | pages = 630–3 |date=July 2005 | pmid = 16040710 | doi = 10.1126/science.1115581 |bibcode = 2005Sci...309..630D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this knowledge, botanists can take advantage of a mutation in the toc1 gene that has been shown to decrease the period of a plant. It is plausible that these toc1 mutants can easily be used to produce plants in a shorter amount of time, with a smaller amount of energy.

The '''All-Earth Ecobot Challenge''' (or Ecobots) is a competition that occurs yearly for students throughout [[Texas]] in grades 5-8 that started in 2009. It encourages students to be creative, learn more about [[robots]], learn about the [[Natural environment|environment]] and how to help protect it, and prepares them for future jobs. The Ecobot Challenge uses various [[Lego]] pieces, [[Lego NXT|Lego NXT sets]], and [[PowerPoint]].

The All Earth Ecobot Challenge happens once a year for students in Texas. It started in 2009 and is for grades 5-8 It helps students learn about the environment, robots, creativity, and preparation for their future careers.

==Preparation==
Usually, a teacher from each school helps coaches teams that come before and/or after school to prepare by programming their [[Lego NXT|NXT]] and sometimes creating their Marketing Presentation(which could also be done at home, but not the [[Lego NXT|NXT]] programming)  in that teacher's classroom. Usually, the team starts to program and make their presentation in early March of earlier.

==Competition==
The competition held yearly consists of two sections: the Robotics section and the Marketing section. They are two separate parts to the competition. The competition is usually help around mid-April. The robot in the competition is only allowed to be touched in "Home". Home is where the robot starts and ends when completing challenges.

===Robotics===
This section requires students to program a [[Lego NXT]] to complete various tasks that change each year. The more tasks students complete, the more points they get (for a maximum of 300 points). To complete the various tasks, students build [[Lego]] attachments usually attached to the motors included in the  Lego NXT kit.

===Marketing===
This section requires students to think of and to make a PowerPoint presentation about an imaginary [[robot]] that will help the Earth environmentally. They present their presentation to judges who score them.

===Sponsors===
The Lego NXT sets and the competition is costly. Ecobots rely on [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] to fund the competition. For a list of sponsors, go to their [http://www.ecobotchallenge.com/sponsors.shtml sponsor list page].

'''''The Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors, and Architects''''' or '''''Le vite de' pittori, scultori et architetti moderni''''' is a series of artist biographies written by [[Gian Pietro Bellori]] (1613–96), whom [[Julius von Schlosser]] called "the most important historiographer of art not only of Rome, but all Italy, even of Europe, in the seventeenth century".&lt;ref name=Schlosser&gt;{{cite book|last1=Von Schlosser|first1=Julius Ritter|title=Die Kunstliteratur: Ein Handbuch zur Quellenkunde der neueren Kunstgeschichte.|date=1924|publisher=Kunstverlag Anton Schroll &amp; Co.|location=Vienna|page=423|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Die_Kunstliteratur.html?id=RaQwAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the foundational texts of the history and criticism of European art.&lt;ref name=Cropper/&gt;

The first edition (1672) contained biographies of nine painters ([[Annibale Carracci|Annibale]] and [[Agostino Carracci]], [[Barocci]], [[Caravaggio]], [[Rubens]], [[Van Dyck]], [[Domenichino]], [[Lanfranco]], and [[Poussin]]), two sculptors ([[François Duquesnoy]] and [[Alessandro Algardi]]), and one architect ([[Domenico Fontana]]). The book was dedicated to [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] and published with French financial support.&lt;ref name=Zirpolo&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zirpolo|first1=Lilian|title=The Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects: A New Translation and Critical Edition by Giovan Pietro Bellori; Alice Sedgwick Wohl Review by: Lilian H.

==Preface==
The preface to the ''Lives'' is an essay Bellori delivered to the [[Accademia di San Luca]], [[Rome]] in 1664. The essay, entitled ''The Idea of the Painter, the Sculptor and the Architect'' (''L'idea del pittore, dello scultore, e dell'architetto'') contributed to a classicist reading of the ''Lives'', as opposed the a book about near-contemporaries.&lt;ref name=Cropper&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cropper|first1=Elizabeth|title=Giovan Pietro Bellori, the Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects: A New Translation and Critical Edition by Alice Sedgwick Wohl|journal=The Burlington Magazine|date=December 2006|volume=148|issue=1245|page=854|jstor=20074653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''torsion box''' consists of [[Sandwich theory|two thin layers of material (skins) on either side of a lightweight core]], usually a grid of beams. It is designed to resist [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] under an applied load. A hollow core door is probably the most common example of a torsion box (stressed skin) structure. The principle is to use less material more efficiently. The torsion box uses the properties of its thin surfaces to carry the imposed loads primarily through tension while the close proximity of the enclosed core material compensates for the tendency of the opposite side to buckle under compression.

Torsion boxes are used in the construction of structural insulated panels for houses, wooden [[table (furniture)|table]]s and [[door]]s, [[ski]]s, [[snowboard]]s, and [[airframe]]s - especially [[wing]]s and [[vertical stabilizer]]s,.

[[Image:Total least squares.svg|right|thumb|200px| The bivariate (Deming regression) case of total least squares. The red lines show the error in both ''x'' and ''y''. This is different from the traditional least squares method which measures error parallel to the ''y'' axis. The case shown, with deviations measured perpendicularly, arises when ''x'' and ''y'' have equal variances.]]

In [[applied statistics]], '''total least squares''' is a type of [[errors-in-variables regression]], a [[least squares]] data modeling technique in which observational errors on both dependent and independent variables are taken into account. It is a generalization of [[Deming regression]] and also of [[orthogonal regression]], and can be applied to both linear and non-linear models.

The total least squares approximation of the data is generically equivalent to the best, in the [[Frobenius norm]], [[low-rank approximation]] of the data matrix.&lt;ref&gt;I. Markovsky and [[Sabine Van Huffel|S. Van Huffel]], ''Overview of total least squares methods.'' Signal Processing, vol. 87, pp. 2283–2302, 2007. [http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/13855/1/tls_overview.pdf preprint]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linear model ==

===Background===

In the [[least squares]] method of data modeling, the [[objective function]], ''S'',
:&lt;math&gt;S=\mathbf{r^TWr},&lt;/math&gt;
is minimized, where ''r'' is the vector of [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]] and ''W'' is a weighting matrix. In [[linear least squares (mathematics)|linear least squares]] the model contains equations which are linear in the parameters appearing in the parameter vector &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\beta&lt;/math&gt;, so the residuals are given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r=y-X\boldsymbol\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;
There are ''m'' observations in '''y''' and ''n'' parameters in '''β''' with ''m''&gt;''n''. '''X''' is a ''m''×''n'' matrix whose elements are either constants or functions of the independent variables, '''x'''. The weight matrix '''W''' is, ideally, the inverse of the [[variance-covariance matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf M_y&lt;/math&gt; of the observations '''y'''. The independent variables are assumed to be error-free. The parameter estimates are found by setting the gradient equations to zero, which results in the normal equations
&lt;ref group="note"&gt;An alternative form is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X^TWX\boldsymbol\Delta \boldsymbol\beta=X^T W \boldsymbol\Delta y}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\Delta \boldsymbol\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the parameter shift from some starting estimate of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\Delta \mathbf y&lt;/math&gt; is the difference between '''y''' and the value calculated using the starting value of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\beta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X^TWX\boldsymbol\beta=X^T Wy}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Allowing observation errors in all variables===

Now, suppose that both '''x''' and '''y''' are observed subject to error, with variance-covariance matrices &lt;math&gt;\mathbf M_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf M_y&lt;/math&gt; respectively. In this case the objective function can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;S=\mathbf{r_x^TM_x^{-1}r_x+r_y^TM_y^{-1}r_y},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r_y&lt;/math&gt; are the residuals in '''x''' and '''y''' respectively. Clearly these residuals cannot be independent of each other, but they must be constrained by some kind of relationship. Writing the model function as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f(r_x,r_y,\boldsymbol\beta)}&lt;/math&gt;, the constraints are expressed by ''m'' [[condition equations]].&lt;ref&gt;W.E. Deming, Statistical Adjustment of Data, Wiley, 1943&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F=\Delta y -\frac{\partial f}{\partial r_x} r_x-\frac{\partial f}{\partial r_y} r_y -X\Delta\boldsymbol\beta=0}.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, the problem is to minimize the objective function subject to the ''m'' constraints. It is solved by the use of [[Lagrange multipliers]]. After some algebraic manipulations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gans |first=Peter |title=Data Fitting in the Chemical Sciences |year=1992 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=9780471934127 |url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471934127.html |accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the result is obtained.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X^TM^{-1}X\Delta \boldsymbol\beta=X^T M^{-1} \Delta y}, &lt;/math&gt;

or alternatively &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X^TM^{-1}X \boldsymbol\beta=X^T M^{-1} y},&lt;/math&gt;
where '''M''' is the variance-covariance matrix relative to both independent and dependent variables.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M=K_xM_xK_x^T+K_yM_yK_y^T;\ K_x=-\frac{\partial f}{\partial r_x},\ K_y=-\frac{\partial f}{\partial r_y}}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example ===

When the data errors are uncorrelated, all matrices '''M''' and '''W''' are diagonal. Then, take the example of straight line fitting.
:&lt;math&gt;f(x_i,\beta)=\alpha + \beta x_i&lt;/math&gt;
in this case
:&lt;math&gt;M_{ii}=\sigma^2_{y,i}+\beta^2 \sigma^2_{x,i}&lt;/math&gt;
showing how the variance at the ''i''th point is determined by the variances of both independent and dependent variables and by the model being used to fit the data. The expression may be generalized by noting that the parameter &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the slope of the line.
:&lt;math&gt;M_{ii}=\sigma^2_{y,i}+\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2_i \sigma^2_{x,i}&lt;/math&gt;

An expression of this type is used in fitting [[Determination of equilibrium constants#Parameter errors and correlation|pH titration data]] where a small error on ''x'' translates to a large error on y when the slope is large.

=== Algebraic point of view ===
First of all it is necessary to note that the TLS problem does not have a solution in general, which was already shown in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;G. H. Golub and C. F. Van Loan, An analysis of the total least squares problem. Numer. Anal., 17, 1980, pp. 883–893.&lt;/ref&gt; The following considers the simple case where a unique solution exists without making any particular assumptions.

The computation of the TLS using [[singular value decomposition]] is described in standard texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}} pp 596.&lt;/ref&gt; We can solve the equation 
:&lt;math&gt;XB \approx Y&lt;/math&gt;
for ''B'' where ''X'' is ''m''-by-''n'' and ''Y'' is ''m''-by-''k''. &lt;ref group="note"&gt;The notation ''XB''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is used here to reflect the notation used in the earlier part of the article.  In the computational literature the problem has been more commonly presented as ''AX''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;''B'', i.e. with the letter ''X'' used for the ''n''-by-''k'' matrix of unknown regression coefficients.&lt;/ref&gt;

That is, we seek to find ''B'' that minimizes error matrices ''E'' and ''F'' for ''X'' and ''Y'' respectively. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{argmin}_{E,F} \| [E\; F] \|_F, \qquad (X+E) B = Y+F&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;[E\; F]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[augmented matrix]] with ''E'' and ''F'' side by side and &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_F&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Frobenius norm]], the square root of the sum of the squares of all entries in a matrix and so equivalently the square root of the sum of squares of the lengths of the rows or columns of the matrix.

This can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;[(X+E) \; (Y+F)] \begin{bmatrix} B\\ -I_k\end{bmatrix} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I_k&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;k\times k&lt;/math&gt; identity matrix.
The goal is then to find &lt;math&gt;[E\; F]&lt;/math&gt; that reduces the rank of &lt;math&gt;[X\; Y]&lt;/math&gt; by ''k''. Define &lt;math&gt;[U] [\Sigma] [V]^*&lt;/math&gt; to be the singular value decomposition of the augmented matrix &lt;math&gt;[X\; Y]&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;[X\; Y] = [U_X\; U_Y] \begin{bmatrix}\Sigma_X &amp;0 \\ 0 &amp; \Sigma_Y\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}V_{XX} &amp; V_{XY} \\ V_{YX} &amp; V_{YY}\end{bmatrix}^* =  [U_X\; U_Y] \begin{bmatrix}\Sigma_X &amp;0 \\ 0 &amp; \Sigma_Y\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} V_{XX}^* &amp; V_{YX}^* \\ V_{XY}^* &amp; V_{YY}^*\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''V'' is partitioned into blocks corresponding to the shape of ''X'' and ''Y''.

Using the [[Eckart–Young theorem]], the approximation minimising the norm of the error is such that matrices &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; are unchanged, while the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-smallest singular values are replaced with zeroes. That is, we want
:&lt;math&gt;[(X+E)\; (Y+F)] = [U_X\; U_Y] \begin{bmatrix}\Sigma_X &amp;0 \\ 0 &amp; 0_{k\times k}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}V_{XX} &amp; V_{XY} \\ V_{YX} &amp; V_{YY}\end{bmatrix}^*&lt;/math&gt;
so by linearity,
:&lt;math&gt;[E\; F] = -[U_X\; U_Y] \begin{bmatrix}0_{n\times n} &amp;0 \\ 0 &amp; \Sigma_Y\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}V_{XX} &amp; V_{XY} \\ V_{YX} &amp; V_{YY}\end{bmatrix}^*. &lt;/math&gt;
We can then remove blocks from the ''U'' and Σ matrices, simplifying to
:&lt;math&gt;[E\; F] = -U_Y\Sigma_Y \begin{bmatrix}V_{XY}\\V_{YY}\end{bmatrix}^*= -[X\; Y] \begin{bmatrix}V_{XY}\\V_{YY}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}V_{XY}\\ V_{YY}\end{bmatrix}^*.&lt;/math&gt;
This provides ''E'' and ''F'' so that 
:&lt;math&gt;[(X+E) \; (Y+F)] \begin{bmatrix}V_{XY}\\ V_{YY}\end{bmatrix} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
Now if &lt;math&gt;V_{YY}&lt;/math&gt; is nonsingular, which is not always the case (note that the behavior of TLS when &lt;math&gt;V_{YY}&lt;/math&gt; is singular is not well understood yet), we can then right multiply both sides by &lt;math&gt;-V_{YY}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to bring the bottom block of the right matrix to the negative identity, giving&lt;ref&gt;Bjõrck, Ake (1996) ''Numerical Methods for Least Squares Problems'', Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. {{ISBN|978-0898713602}} {{page needed|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[(X+E) \; (Y+F)] \begin{bmatrix} -V_{XY} V_{YY}^{-1} \\ -V_{YY} V_{YY}^{-1}\end{bmatrix} = [(X+E) \; (Y+F)] \begin{bmatrix} B\\ -I_k\end{bmatrix} =  0 ,&lt;/math&gt;
and so
:&lt;math&gt;B=-V_{XY} V_{YY}^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

A naive [[GNU Octave]] implementation of this is:

&lt;source lang="matlab"&gt;
function B = tls(X,Y)

[m n]   = size(X);            % n is the width of X (X is m by n)
Z       = [X Y];              % Z is X augmented with Y.
[U S V] = svd(Z,0);           % find the SVD of Z.
VXY     = V(1:n,1+n:end);     % Take the block of V consisting of the first n rows and the n+1 to last column
VYY     = V(1+n:end,1+n:end); % Take the bottom-right block of V.
B       = -VXY/VYY;

end
&lt;/source&gt;

The way described above of solving the problem, which requires that the matrix &lt;math&gt;V_{YY}&lt;/math&gt; is nonsingular, can be slightly extended by the so-called ''classical TLS algorithm''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sabine Van Huffel|S. Van Huffel]] and J. Vandewalle (1991) ''The Total Least Squares Problems: Computational Aspects and Analysis''. SIAM Publications, Philadelphia PA.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computation ===

The standard implementation of classical TLS algorithm is available through [http://www.netlib.org/vanhuffel/index.html Netlib], see also.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sabine Van Huffel|S. Van Huffel]], Documented Fortran 77 programs of the extended classical total least squares algorithm, the partial singular value decomposition algorithm and the partial total least squares algorithm, Internal Report ESAT-KUL 88/1, ESAT Lab., Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sabine Van Huffel|S. Van Huffel]], The extended classical total least squares algorithm, J. Comput. Appl. Math., 25, pp. 111–119, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; All modern implementations based, for example, on solving a sequence of ordinary least squares problems, approximate the matrix &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; (denoted &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in the literature), as introduced by [[Sabine Van Huffel|Van Huffel]] and Vandewalle. It is worth noting, that this &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is, however, ''not the TLS solution'' in many cases.&lt;ref&gt;M. Plešinger, The Total Least Squares Problem and Reduction of Data in AX ≈ B. Doctoral Thesis, TU of Liberec and Institute of Computer Science, AS CR Prague, 2008. Ph.D. Thesis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. Hnětynková, M. Plešinger, D. M. Sima, Z. Strakoš, and [[Sabine Van Huffel|S. Van Huffel]], The total least squares problem in AX ≈ B. A new classification with the relationship to the classical works. SIMAX vol. 32 issue 3 (2011), pp. 748–770.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-linear model ==
For [[non-linear least squares|non-linear systems]] similar reasoning shows that the normal equations for an iteration cycle can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J^TM^{-1}J\Delta \boldsymbol\beta=J^T M^{-1} \Delta y}. &lt;/math&gt;

== Geometrical interpretation ==
{{main|Curve fitting#Algebraic fit versus geometric fit for curves}}
{{further|Orthogonal regression}}
When the independent variable is error-free a residual represents the "vertical" distance between the observed data point and the fitted curve (or surface). In total least squares a residual represents the distance between a data point and the fitted curve measured along some direction. In fact, if both variables are measured in the same units and the errors on both variables are the same, then the residual represents the [[distance from a point to a line|shortest distance between the data point and the fitted curve]], that is, the residual vector is perpendicular to the tangent of the curve. For this reason, this type of regression is sometimes called ''two dimensional Euclidean regression'' (Stein, 1983)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stein |first=Yaakov J. |title=Two Dimensional Euclidean Regression |url =http://www.dspcsp.com/pubs/euclreg.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''orthogonal regression''.

== Scale invariant methods ==
A serious difficulty arises if the variables are not measured in the same units. First consider measuring distance between a data point and the line, as in the diagram – what are the measurement units for this distance? If we consider measuring distance based on Pythagoras' Theorem then it is clear that we shall be adding quantities measured in different units, which is  meaningless. Secondly, if we rescale one of the variables e.g., measure in grams rather than kilograms, then we shall end up with different results (a different line). To avoid these problems it is sometimes suggested that we convert to dimensionless variables—this may be called normalization or standardization. However there are various ways of doing this, and these lead to fitted models which are not equivalent to each other. One approach is to normalize by known (or estimated) measurement precision thereby minimizing the [[Mahalanobis distance]] from the points to the line, providing a [[maximum-likelihood]] solution;{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} the unknown precisions could be found via [[analysis of variance]].

In short, total least squares does not have the property of units-invariance&amp;mdash;i.e. it is not [[scale invariance|scale invariant]]. For a meaningful model we require this property to hold. A way forward is to realise that residuals (distances) measured in different units can be combined if multiplication is used instead of addition. Consider fitting a line: for each data point the product of the vertical and horizontal residuals equals twice the area of the triangle formed by the residual lines and the fitted line. We choose the line which minimizes the sum of these areas. Nobel laureate [[Paul Samuelson]] proved in 1942 that, in two dimensions, it is the only line expressible solely in terms of the ratios of standard deviations and the correlation coefficient which (1) fits the correct equation when the observations fall on a straight line, (2) exhibits scale invariance, and (3) exhibits invariance under interchange of variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=Paul A. |year=1942 |title=A Note on Alternative Regressions |journal=Econometrica |publisher=The Econometric Society |doi=10.2307/1907024 |jstor=1907024 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=80–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; This solution has been rediscovered in different disciplines and is variously known as '''standardised major axis''' (Ricker 1975, Warton et al., 2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ricker |first=W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8665">A '''vacuum flange''' is a [[flange]] at the end of a tube used to connect [[vacuum chamber]]s, tubing and [[vacuum pump]]s to each other. Vacuum flanges are used for scientific and industrial applications to allow various pieces of equipment to interact via physical connections and for vacuum maintenance, monitoring, and manipulation from outside a vacuum's chamber. Several flange standards exist with differences in ultimate attainable [[pressure]], size, and ease of attachment.

==Vacuum flange types==

===KF/QF===
[[File:KF 25 Tee.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|A KF-25 tee, o-ring, and clamp]]
The [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard quick release flange is known by the names Quick Flange (QF), Klein Flange (KF) or NW, sometimes also as DN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesker.com/newweb/flanges/flanges_technicalnotes_kf_1.cfm?pgid=0 |title=KF (QF) Flanges Technical Notes |accessdate=2007-09-02 |publisher= Kurt J. Lesker Company }}&lt;/ref&gt; The KF designation has been adopted by ISO, [[DIN]], and [[Pneurop]]. KF flanges are made with a [[chamfer]]ed back surface that are attached with a circular clamp and an [[elastomer]]ic [[o-ring]] that is mounted in a metal centering ring. Standard sizes are indicated by the nominal inner diameter in millimeters for flanges 10 through 50&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.&lt;ref name="caburn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caburn.com/resources/downloads/pdfs/sec1.2.pdf |title=ISO KF Flanges and Fittings |accessdate=2007-09-02 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sizes 10, 20 and 32 are less common sizes (see [[Preferred_number#Reynard_numbers|Reynard numbers]]). Some sizes share their flange dimensions with their respective larger neighbor and use the same clamp size. This means a DN10KF can mate to a DN16KF by using an adaptive centering ring. The same applies for DN20KF to DN25KF and DN32KF to DN40KF.
:
* DN10KF
* DN16KF
* DN20KF
* DN25KF
* DN32KF
* DN40KF
* DN50KF

===ISO===
The ISO large flange standard is known as LF, LFB, MF or sometimes just ISO flange. As in KF-flanges, the flanges are joined by a centering ring and an elastomeric o-ring. An extra spring-loaded circular clamp is often used around the large-diameter o-rings to prevent them from rolling off from the centering ring during mounting.

The ISO large flanges come in two varieties. The ISO-K (or ISO LF) flanges are joined with double-claw clamps, which clamp to a circular groove on the tubing side of the flange. The ISO-F (or ISO LFB) flanges have holes for attaching the two flanges with bolts. Two tubes with ISO-K and ISO-F flanges can be joined together by clamping the ISO-K side with single-claw clamps, which are then bolted to the holes on the ISO-F side.

ISO large flanges are available in sizes from 63 to 500&amp;nbsp;mm nominal tube diameter:&lt;ref name="caburn"/&gt;
* DN63LF (63.5&amp;nbsp;mm)
* DN100LF (102&amp;nbsp;mm)
* DN160LF (160&amp;nbsp;mm)
* DN200LF (200&amp;nbsp;mm)
* DN250LF (254&amp;nbsp;mm)
* DN320LF (316&amp;nbsp;mm)
* DN400LF (400&amp;nbsp;mm)
* DN500LF (500&amp;nbsp;mm)

===CF (Conflat)===
[[File:Conflat Flange.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|A 2¾ CF (conflat) full nipple with blank flange and [[Oxygen-free copper|OFHC]] gasket]]
[[File:60kV Feedthrough.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|A 60 kV [[high-voltage]] electrical feedthrough on a 4½ inch (or DN63) conflat flange]]
Several vacuum flange [[technical standard|standard]]s exist, and the same flange types are called by different names by different manufacturers and [[standards organization]]s.
CF (ConFlat) flanges use a copper gasket and knife-edge flange to achieve an [[ultrahigh vacuum]] seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesker.com/newweb/flanges/flanges_technicalnotes_conflat_1.cfm |title=CF Flanges Technical Notes |accessdate=2007-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "ConFlat" is a registered trademark of [[Varian, Inc.]], so "CF" is commonly used by other flange manufacturers. Each face of the two mating CF flanges has a knife edge, which cuts into the softer metal gasket, providing an extremely leak-tight, metal-to-metal seal. Deformation of the metal gasket fills small defects in the flange, allowing Conflat flanges operate down to 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; [[Torr]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; [[pascal (unit)|Pa]]) pressure. The knife edge is recessed in a groove in each flange. In addition to protecting the knife edge, the groove helps hold the gasket in place, which aligns the two flanges and also reduces gasket expansion during [[bake-out]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avs.org/About/Awards-Recognition/Awardee-Interviews/Interviews/William-R-Wheeler/Interview-Transcript |title=AVS Interview: 1996 Albert Nerken Award Recipient: William R. Wheeler  |author=Daniel Bills |date=1996-10-06 |accessdate=2009-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For stainless-steel conflat flanges, baking temperatures of 450&amp;nbsp;°C can be achieved; the temperature is limited by the choice of gasket material. CF flanges are sexless and interchangeable. In North America, flange sizes are given by flange outer diameter in inches, while in Europe and Asia, sizes are given by tube inner diameter in millimeters. Despite the different naming conventions, the actual flanges are the same.

ConFlat gaskets were originally invented by William Wheeler and other engineers at Varian in an attempt to build a flange that would not leak after baking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avs.org/popup.aspx?FileName=wheeler_int|title=AVS Interview: 1996 Albert Nerken Award Recipient: William R. Wheeler |accessdate=2009-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wheeler===
A Wheeler flange is a large wire-seal flange often used on large vacuum chambers.&lt;ref&gt;''Metal Vacuum Joint'', William R. Wheeler, Varian Associates, {{Cite patent|US|3458221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ASA===
[[ANSI]] has a flange standard called ASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesker.com/newweb/flanges/flanges_technicalnotes_asa_1.cfm?pgid=0 |title=ASA Flanges Technical Notes |accessdate=2007-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These flanges are elastomeric o-ring seal and can be used for both vacuum and pressure applications.  Flange sizes are indicated by tube nominal inner diameter or by flange outer diameter (in inches):  1 (4.25 O.D.), 1.5 (5.00 O.D.), 2 (6.00 O.D.), 3 (7.50 O.D.), 4 (9.00 O.D.), 6 (11.00 O.D.), 8 (13.5 O.D.), 10 (16.00 O.D.).

==Vacuum gaskets==
To achieve a vacuum seal, a [[gasket]] is required. An elastomeric [[o-ring]] gasket can be made of [[Buna rubber]], [[viton]] fluoropolymer, [[silicone rubber]] or [[teflon]]. O-rings can be placed in a groove or may be used in combination with a centering ring or as a "captured" o-ring that is held in place by separate metal rings. Metal gaskets are used in ultra-high vacuum systems where the [[outgassing]] of the elastomer could be a significant gas load. A copper ring gasket is used with conflat flanges. Metal wire gaskets made of copper, [[gold]] or [[indium]] can be used.

==Vacuum feedthrough==
A vacuum feedthrough is a flange that contains a vacuum-tight electrical, physical or mechanical connection to the vacuum chamber. An electrical feedthrough allows voltages to be applied to components under vacuum, for example a [[Electrical filament|filament]] or [[heater]]. An example of a physical feedthrough is a vacuum-tight connection for cooling water. A mechanical feedthrough is used for [[rotation]] and [[translation_(geometry)|translation]] of components under vacuum. A wobble stick is a mechanical feedthrough device that can be used to pick up, move and otherwise manipulate objects in the vacuum chamber.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2184">'''William Zeitlin''' (c. 1850 – 1921, in [[Leipzig]]) was a Russian scholar and bibliographer born at [[Homel]], government (''[[guberniya]]'') of [[Moghilef]], about the middle of the 19th century. He is known especially as the author of ''Kiryat Sefer,'' or ''Bibliotheca Hebraica Post-Mendelssohniana'' (Leipzig, 1891–95), a bibliographical dictionary of modern [[Hebrew literature]] from the beginning of [[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s epoch until 1890. The compilation of this work occupied Zeitlin for twenty years. He made extensive use of [[Benjacob]]'s ''Otzar ha-Sefarim'' and of [[Julius Fürst|Fürst]]'s ''Bibliotheca Judaica'', and visited [[Vilna]] and [[Warsaw]], the centers of the Hebrew book market, as well as many university cities—as [[Königsberg]], [[Berlin]], [[Geneva]], and [[Paris]]—from the libraries of which he gathered additional material for his work.

The ''Qiryat Sefer'' indexes not only works in book form, but also important periodical articles, biographical sketches, and scientific essays, in addition to giving biographical notes on several authors. Zeitlin had previously prepared an index of works written on the [[Hebrew calendar]], in which he enumerates seventy-seven Hebrew works; this index was published by [[Chayyim Jonah Gurland]] in ''Yevreiski Kalendar'' (St. Petersburg, 1882). In the ''Zeit. für Hebr. Bibl.'' (ix.3-4) Zeitlin has published an alphabetical list of anagrams and pseudonyms of modern Hebrew writers; he was also a contributor to several Hebrew periodicals, writing mostly biographical articles.

'''Writers of the Future''' ('''WOTF''') is a [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] story contest that was established by [[L. Ron Hubbard]] in the early 1980s. A sister contest, '''Illustrators of the Future,''' presents awards for science fiction art.  Hubbard characterized the contest as a way of "giving back" to the field that had defined his professional writing life.  The contest has no entry fee and is the highest-paying contest for amateur science-fiction and fantasy writers.  Notable past winners of WOTF include [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], [[Karen Joy Fowler]], [[James Alan Gardner]], [[Nina Kiriki Hoffman]], [[Jay Lake]], [[Michael H. Payne]], [[Patrick Rothfuss]], [[Robert Reed (author)|Robert Reed]], [[Dean Wesley Smith]], [[Sean Williams (author)|Sean Williams]], [[Dave Wolverton]], [[Nancy Farmer (author)|Nancy Farmer]], and [[David Zindell]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Contest rules and procedures==

===Writers of the Future===
The Writers of the Future (WOTF) contest may be entered quarterly, and is open to authors who have no, or few, professional publications. The contest rules state that entrants cannot have had published "a [[novel]] or [[novella|short novel]], or more than one [[Novella|novelette]], or more than three [[short story|short stories]], in any medium. Professional publication is deemed to be payment and at least 5,000 copies or 5,000 hits."  Works that are less than 3,000 words and for which payment was less 6c/word, do not count as "professional" publications.  Stories of up to 17,000 words in length can be submitted to the contest. Poems, screenplays, non-fiction, etc., are not eligible.&lt;ref name=rules&gt;
{{Citation
  | title = Contest Rules
  | date = 
  | year = 
  | url = http://www.writersofthefuture.com/rules.htm
  | publisher =  Writers of the Future web site 
  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuscripts are judged with the authors' names deleted and are separated out in quarterfinal and semifinal award rounds by the Coordinating Judge (previously [[K. D. Wentworth]], currently [[Dave Wolverton]], and originally [[Algis Budrys]]). Eight finalists are sent to a panel of professional science fiction writers, who determine the top three awards. Prizes are $1000 (first place), $750 (second) and $500 (third).  The process is then repeated the next quarter.  At the end of the contest year, the four quarterly first place stories compete for a separate annual grand prize, the "Gold Award," which includes an additional $5000. The first, second and third-place winners and often a selection of the other finalist stories are published annually, for which the writers receive additional compensation for publication rights.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;  Thus, a grand prize-winning author can make over $6000 for a single story - more than many writers receive for a first novel.&lt;ref&gt;Buckell, Tobias, "[http://www.tobiasbuckell.com/2005/10/05/author-advance-survey-version-20/ Author Advance Survey]," version 2.0 (Oct 2005), retrieved 25 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some finalist stories not considered among the top three (in effect, the fourth or fifth placers) may be included in the annual anthology.  These are called "published finalists."  The writers are compensated for publication rights, but are not considered winners and receive no prize money, but are eligible to re-enter the contest.  Often writers will repeatedly enter the contest, quarter after quarter, until they either win or become ineligible due to publications elsewhere.

===Illustrators of the Future===
An artists' contest, the Illustrators of the Future (IOTF), was added in 1988.  Like the WOTF contest, the Illustrators contest is open to amateurs.  The Rules state: "The Contest is open to those who have not previously published more than three black-and-white story illustrations, or more than one process-color painting, in media distributed nationally to the general public, such as magazines or books sold at newsstands, or books sold in stores merchandising to the general public. The submitted entry shall not have been previously published in professional media as exampled above."&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;

Entrants submit a portfolio of three pieces of artwork, which are circulated among the judges.  Up to three winners are selected every quarter, each given a prize of $500.  Unlike the Writers, the Illustrators are not ranked.  After the completion of the contest year, each of the twelve Illustration winners is assigned one of the stories from among the twelve Writer winners, and given a month to return the finished illustration.  A single grand prize, also called the Gold Award, is accompanied by a prize of $5000 - judging is based only on the final illustration, not the initial portfolio.  While the art is judged according to standard artistic considerations (composition, draftsmanship, consistency of lighting, [[sense of wonder]], facial expressions, etc.), a key consideration during the final judging is whether or not the art would make the viewer want to read the accompanying story.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;  The art is also included in the annual anthology, and illustrators are additionally compensated.

===Awards and workshop===
No official tallies are given for the number of entrants in either contest, but it is believed that thousands enter the Writers contest every quarter, while only hundreds enter the Illustration contest.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  Thus, the Illustration judges are sometimes often unable to find three deserving winners, and only pick one or two.  (This is not a problem for the Writing judges.)  Should the Illustration winners number less than twelve in a year, each illustrator is - as usual - assigned a single story to illustrate for purposes of determining who wins the Gold Award.  Returning the assigned illustration quickly does not directly correlate to winning the Gold Award, but those artists who do so are allowed the opportunity to illustrate additional stories.   

All winners and published finalists are invited to attend the annual week-long writers' and artists' workshops and Awards gala at the invitation and expense of the contest administration.  Tuxedoes and gowns are worn by the judges, administrators, and winners for the Awards gala (but members of the general public are casually attired), and various Hollywood actors are generally in attendance, in addition to prominent science fiction authors and artists.  These include the present judges in addition to a famous and generally elderly writer given a Lifetime Achievement Award.  While it is not required to attend the week-long festivities and seminars, it is thought by some that those in the running for the Gold Award may advance their cause by displaying professionalism and hard work at that time; judges for the contest, however, refute this, as the judging is done blindly in advance of the week-long pre-awards event and most judges don't arrive on site until the last day of the workshop.

==Judges==
Many noted writers and artists have judged WotF awards, or have won them themselves.
Notable writing judges have included: [[Kevin J. Anderson]], [[Gregory Benford]], [[Algis Budrys]], [[Orson Scott Card]], [[Brian Herbert]], [[Nina Kiriki Hoffman]], [[Anne McCaffrey]], [[Larry Niven]], [[Andre Norton]], [[Frederik Pohl]], [[Jerry Pournelle]], [[Tim Powers]], [[Brandon Sanderson]], [[Robert J. Sawyer]], [[K. D. Wentworth]], and [[Jack Williamson]].&lt;ref name="writing judges"&gt;

==Connections to Scientology==
[[File:WOTF22cover.png|thumb|121px|Cover of Volume 22 of the anthology series ''Writers of the Future'', prominently featuring Hubbard's name]]

The original sponsor of the contest was [[Bridge Publications (Scientology)|Bridge Publications]], Inc., the publishing arm of the [[Church of Scientology]]. Prior to the 2004 contest, the sponsorship moved to [[Author Services Inc.]] under the [[trade name]] [[Galaxy Press]], which was spun off from Bridge to publish Hubbard's fiction and the contest anthologies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The contest has also been characterized as a promotional vehicle for Hubbard himself, who returned to science fiction writing with ''[[Battlefield Earth (novel)|Battlefield Earth]]'' at about the same time as he began the contest. On the covers of the annual WOTF anthologies, Hubbard's name appears "above the title", and in at least as prominent a font. The prominence of Hubbard's name and the lavish funding of the contest awards, publicity and ceremonies have led some to speculate that the contest is part of a campaign by the Church of Scientology to promote Hubbard's status in the science fiction and literary communities.&lt;ref&gt;

Entering or winning the contest does not require or imply endorsement or membership in the Church of Scientology, and the contest itself has been endorsed by a wide range of well-known speculative fiction writers (see Judges and Winners above) who have no relationship to Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;

According to Director of the Writers and Illustrators Contests Joni Labaqui, the funds to underwrite the contest—including the cash prizes, the gala awards ceremony and the weeklong pre-awards festivities—come from the Hubbard estate. The Hubbard estate is separate from the Church of Scientology and earns royalties from sales of Hubbard's books, including his fiction. Labaqui also reports that staff of Author Services Inc. is entirely made up of Scientologists.&lt;ref&gt;

However, records with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] show that the rights to the Writers of the Future name were transferred from the L. Ron Hubbard estate ("Family Trust-B") to the [[Church of Spiritual Technology]] in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Trademark Assignment Abstract of Title | url = http://assignments.uspto.gov/assignments/q?db=tm&amp;sno=73703450 | work =  | publisher = [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] | date = 1989-01-03 | accessdate = 2008-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and under the 1993 [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] closing agreement with the Church of Scientology, the L. Ron Hubbard estate became part of the Church of Spiritual Technology, a "Scientology-related entity".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Scientology Settles With IRS | date = 1997-12-30 | newspaper = [[Wall Street Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1346">[[File:Dai Jin-Travelers Through Mountain Passes.jpg|thumb|[[Dai Jin]], considered the founder of the school, ''Travellers Through Mountain Passes'']]
The '''Zhe School''' (浙派) was a [[school]] of painters and was part of the Northern School, which thrived during the [[Ming dynasty]]. The school was led by [[Dai Jin]], traditionally considered its founder. The "Zhe" of the name refers to Dai Jin's home province - [[Zhejiang]]. The school was not a school in the proper sense of the word in that the painters did not formulate a new distinctive style, preferring instead to further the style of the [[Southern Song]], specializing in decorative and large paintings. Instead the school was identified by the formal, academic and conservative outlook, being a revival in the early [[Ming Dynasty]] of the Ma-Xia (Ma Yuan 馬遠, Xia Gui 夏珪), 'academic', style of painting landscapes of the Southern Song.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinaonlinemuseum.com/painting-zhe-school.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''École Polytechnique massacre''', also known as the '''Montreal massacre''', was a [[mass shooting]] at the [[École Polytechnique de Montréal|École Polytechnique]] in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada that occurred on December 6, 1989. Twenty-five-year-old [[Marc Lépine]], armed with a rifle and a [[hunting knife]], shot 28 people, killing 14 women, before committing suicide. He began his attack by entering a classroom at the university, where he separated the male and female students. After claiming that he was "fighting [[feminism]]" and calling the women "a bunch of feminists," he shot all nine women in the room, killing six. He then moved through corridors, the cafeteria, and another classroom, specifically targeting women to shoot. Overall, he killed fourteen women and injured ten other women and four men in just under 20 minutes before turning the gun on himself.&lt;!-- Most websources including media reports say 13, but a careful check of the coroner's report indicates that there were 14 wounded: one arrived at hospital by foot and was presumably only mildly injured, and therefore probably did not get onto the list of wounded referenced here. Please see http://www.diarmani.com/Montreal_Coroners_Report.pdf and confirm it for yourself!!--&gt; [[Marc Lépine#Suicide statement|His suicide note]] claimed political motives and blamed feminists for ruining his life. The note included a list of 19 Quebec women whom Lépine considered to be feminists and apparently wished to kill. It is the deadliest mass shooting in Canadian history.

Since the attack, Canadians have debated various interpretations of the events, their significance, and Lépine's motives. Many feminist groups and public officials have characterized the [[massacre]] as an anti-feminist attack that is representative of wider societal [[violence against women]]. Consequently, the anniversary of the massacre has since been commemorated as the [[National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women]]. Other interpretations emphasize Lépine's abuse as a child or suggest that the massacre was simply the isolated act of a madman, unrelated to larger social issues. Still other commentators have blamed violence in the media and increasing poverty, isolation, and alienation in society, particularly in immigrant communities.

The incident led to more stringent [[gun control]] laws in Canada. It also introduced changes in the tactical response of police to shootings, changes which were later credited with minimizing casualties at the 2006 [[Dawson College shooting]]s.

==Massacre==
Sometime after 4&amp;nbsp;p.m. on December 6, 1989, [[Marc Lépine]] arrived at the building housing the École Polytechnique, an engineering school affiliated with the [[Université de Montréal]], armed with a [[semi-automatic rifle]] and a [[hunting knife]].&lt;ref name="coroner"&gt;Sourour, Teresa K., (1991) [http://www.diarmani.com/Montreal_Coroners_Report.pdf Report of Coroner's Investigation] (PDF). Retrieved on December 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He had purchased a rifle on November 21, 1989, in a Checkmate Sports store in Montreal, telling the clerk that he was going to use it to hunt small game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last =Weston| first =Greg| title =Why? We may never know|work=Toronto Sun| date = September 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lépine was familiar with the layout of the building since he had been in and around the École Polytechnique at least seven times in the weeks leading up to the event.&lt;ref name="coroner"/&gt;

[[File:Exterior of Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal.jpg|thumb|left|Exterior of École Polytechnique de Montréal|alt= oblique view of a long, modern building about 6 storeys high, with many windows and large main entrance]]

Lépine sat for a time in the office of the registrar on the second floor. He was seen rummaging through a plastic bag and did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. He left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second-floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="coroner"/&gt; After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Gunman massacres 14 women| work =Archives| publisher =CBC| date = December 6, 1989| url =http://archives.cbc.ca/society/crime_justice/topics/398-2235/| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110604052652/http://archives.cbc.ca/society/crime_justice/topics/398-2235/| archivedate =2011-06-04| format =video stream| accessdate =December 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lépine then separated the nine women from the approximately fifty men and ordered the men to leave.&lt;ref name="cernea"&gt;{{cite book|title=Poly 1989: Témoin de l'horreur|last=Cernea|first=Adrian|publisher=Éditions Lescop|year=1999|isbn=2-9804832-8-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in French, he asked the remaining women whether they knew why they were there, and when one student replied "no," he answered: "I am fighting feminism." One of the students, Nathalie Provost, said, "Look, we are just women studying engineering, not necessarily feminists ready to march on the streets to shout we are against men, just students intent on leading a normal life." Lépine responded, "You're women, you're going to be engineers. You're all a bunch of feminists. I hate feminists." He then opened fire on the students from left to right, killing six, and wounding three others, including Provost.&lt;ref name="coroner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chun"/&gt;  Before leaving the room, he wrote ''shit'' twice on a student project.&lt;ref name="cernea"/&gt;

Lépine continued into the second-floor corridor and wounded three students before entering another room where he twice attempted to shoot a female student. When his weapon failed to fire, he entered the emergency staircase where he was seen reloading his gun. He returned to the room he had just left, but the students had locked the door; Lépine failed to unlock it with three shots fired into the door. Moving along the corridor, he shot at others, wounding one, before moving towards the financial services office where he shot and killed a woman through the window of the door she had just locked.&lt;ref name="coroner"/&gt;

[[File:Third floor classroom.JPG|thumb|The third floor classroom in the École Polytechnique in which the attack ended|alt=view of a classroom from the rear, with blackboard and three desks and tables at the front of the class, and five rows of long curved student desks with blue chairs attached.]]

He next went down to the first-floor cafeteria, in which about a hundred people were gathered. The crowd scattered after he shot a woman standing near the kitchens and wounded another student. Entering an unlocked storage area at the end of the cafeteria, Lépine shot and killed two more women hiding there. He told a male and female student to come out from under a table; they complied and were not shot.&lt;ref name="coroner"/&gt;

Lépine then walked up an escalator to the third floor where he shot and wounded one female and two male students in the corridor. He entered another classroom and told the three students giving a presentation to "get out," shooting and wounding Maryse Leclair, who was standing on the low platform at the front of the classroom. He fired on students in the front row and then killed two women who were trying to escape the room, while other students dived under their desks. Lépine moved towards some of the female students, wounding three of them and killing another. He changed the [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] in his weapon and moved to the front of the class, shooting in all directions. At this point, the wounded Leclair asked for help; Lépine unsheathed his hunting knife and stabbed her three times, killing her. He took off his cap, wrapped his coat around his rifle, exclaimed, "Ah shit," and then committed suicide by shooting himself in the head, twenty minutes after having begun his attack.&lt;ref name="injured"&gt;{{cite news | last =Buchignani| first =Walter| title =Amid the tragedy, miracles of survival| page = A3| newspaper = [[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] |location =Montreal| date =December 8, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; About sixty unfired cartridges remained in the boxes he carried with him. He had killed fourteen women in total (twelve engineering students, one nursing student and one employee of the university) and injured fourteen &lt;!-- NB most web and news reports state 13 wounded, but the coroner's report indicates several times that actually 14 were wounded. http://www.diarmani.com/Montreal_Coroners_Report.pdf! --&gt;other people, including four men.&lt;ref name="coroner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="injured"/&gt;

After briefing reporters outside, [[Service de police de la Ville de Montréal|Montreal Police]] director of public relations Pierre Leclair entered the building and found his daughter Maryse's stabbed body.&lt;ref name="macleans"&gt;{{cite news | last =Came| first =Barry|author2=Burke, D |author3=Ferzoco, G. |author4=O'Farreli, B |author5=Wallace, B | title = Montreal Massacre: Railing Against Feminists| publisher = Maclean's Magazine | date =December 18, 1989| url= http://business.highbeam.com/4341/article-1G1-8269667/montreal-massacre-railing-against-feminists-gunman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="funeral"&gt;{{cite news | last =Mennie| first =James|author2=Bauch, Hubert | title = A quiet goodbye for slain women| page =A1| newspaper = The Gazette |location=Montreal | date =December 12, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quebec and Montreal governments declared three days of mourning.&lt;ref name="macleans"/&gt; A joint funeral for nine of the women was held at [[Notre-Dame Basilica (Montreal)|Notre-Dame Basilica]] on December 11, 1989, and was attended by Governor General [[Jeanne Sauvé]], Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]], Quebec premier [[Robert Bourassa]], and Montreal mayor [[Jean Doré]], along with thousands of other mourners.&lt;ref name="funeral"/&gt;

===Suicide letter===
Marc Lépine's inside jacket pocket contained a [[Marc Lépine#Lépine's suicide statement|suicide letter]] and two letters to friends, all dated the day of the massacre.&lt;ref name="coroner"/&gt; Some details from the suicide letter were revealed by the police two days after the event,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Malarek| first =Victor| title =More Massacre Details to be Released by Police, but an Inquiry Ruled Out| page =A6| newspaper =Globe and Mail| date = December 12, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Malarek|first =Victor| title =Killer's letter blames feminists| page =A7| newspaper =Globe and Mail |date = December 8, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the full text was not disclosed.

He outlined his reasons for the attack including his anger towards feminists for seeking social changes that "retain the advantages of being women [...] while trying to grab those of the men."&lt;ref name="citynews"&gt;{{cite news| title =CityNews Rewind: The Montreal Massacre| publisher =City News| date = December 6, 2006 | url =http://www.citynews.ca/2006/12/06/citynews-rewind-the-montreal-massacre/| accessdate =December 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also mentioned [[Denis Lortie]], a [[Canadian Armed Forces]] corporal who killed three government employees and wounded thirteen others in an armed attack on the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] on May 7, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Eglin &amp; Hester 2003, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; The text of the original letter in French is available, as well as an [[Marc Lépine#Suicide statement|English translation]].

In addition, some suicides were later reported among students who had been present at the time of the massacre. At least two students left notes confirming that they committed suicide due to distress caused by the massacre.&lt;ref name="jidv" /&gt;

==Perpetrator==
The shooter, [[Marc Lépine]], was born to a [[French Canadians|French-Canadian]] mother and an [[Algeria]]n father and at birth he was named Gamil Gharbi. His father, a mutual funds salesman, did not consider women to be the equal of men.  He was physically and verbally abusive to his wife and son, discouraging tenderness between mother and child.&lt;ref name="Citizen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mother"&gt;{{cite news|last=CTV.ca News Staff |title=Mother of Marc Lepine finally breaks her silence |publisher=CTV |date=September 18, 2006 |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/print/CTVNews/20060925/lepine_mother_060925/20060925/?hub=Canada&amp;subhub=PrintStory |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318031547/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/print/CTVNews/20060925/lepine_mother_060925/20060925/?hub=Canada&amp;subhub=PrintStory |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 18, 2007 |accessdate=January 1, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Gamil was seven, his parents separated; his father ceased contact with his children soon after.&lt;ref name="Citizen" /&gt; His mother returned to nursing to support the family, and because of her schedule, the children lived with other families during the week.

==Search for a rationale==
The massacre profoundly shocked Canadians. Government and criminal justice officials feared that extensive public discussion about the massacre would cause pain to the families and lead to antifeminist violence.&lt;ref name="Chun" /&gt; As a result, a public inquiry was not held,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Malarek| first =Victor| title =More Massacre Details to be Released by Police, but an Inquiry Ruled Out| page =A14|work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada | date = December 12, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Marc Lépine's suicide letter was not officially released.

He noted that Marc Lépine defined suicide as his primary motivation, and that he chose a specific suicide method, namely killing oneself after killing others (multiple homicide/suicide strategy), which is considered a sign of a serious [[personality disorder]].&lt;ref name="coroner" /&gt;  Other psychiatrists emphasized the traumatic events of his childhood, suggesting that the blows he had received may have caused brain damage, or that Lépine was [[psychotic]], having lost touch with reality as he tried to erase the memories of a brutal (yet largely absent) father while unconsciously identifying with a violent [[masculinity]] that dominated women.&lt;ref name="foxbook"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Fox | first = James Alan| last2 = Levin | first2 = Jack  |title = Extreme killing: Understanding serial and mass murder | publisher = Sage Publications |pages = 227–230 |year = 2005 | isbn = 0-7619-8857-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="poly" /&gt; A different theory was that Lépine's childhood experiences of [[child abuse|abuse]] led him to feel victimized as he faced losses and rejections in his later life.&lt;ref name="poly"&gt;{{cite news | last =Lortie | first = Marie-Claude |title = Poly un an après : Psychose?

The injured and witnesses among university staff and students suffered a variety of physical, social, existential, financial, and psychological consequences, including [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].

===Police response===
Police response to the shootings was heavily criticized for the amount of time it gave Lépine to carry out the massacre. The first police officers to arrive at the scene established a perimeter around the building and waited before entering the building. During this period, several women were killed.&lt;ref name="coroner" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Sheppard| first =Robert| title =A sea change in police tactics when it comes to gunmen| publisher =CBC News| date = September 15, 2006| url =http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/realitycheck/sheppard/20060915.html | accessdate =December 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent changes to emergency response protocols led to praise of emergency responders' handling of the [[Dawson College shooting]] in 2006 in which one woman was killed by a shooter. In that incident, coordination amongst emergency response agencies and prompt intervention were credited with minimizing the loss of life.&lt;ref name="Dawson"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2006/09/14/pf-1839448.html|title=Lessons learned from 1989 Montreal massacre help save lives at Dawson college|last=Rakobowchuk|first=Peter|date=September 14, 2006|newspaper=Canadian Press|accessdate=December 28, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130115093944/http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2006/09/14/pf-1839448.html|archivedate=January 15, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gun control===
{{Further|Gun politics in Canada}}

The massacre was a major spur for the Canadian gun control movement.&lt;ref name="Dec6"&gt;{{cite book| last =Rathjen| first =Heidi|author2=Charles Montpetit | title =December 6: From the Montreal Massacre to Gun Control| publisher =McClelland &amp; Stewart| year =1999 |location =Toronto| isbn = 0-7710-6125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heidi Rathjen, a student who was in one of the classrooms Lépine did not enter during the shooting, organized the Coalition for Gun Control with Wendy Cukier.&lt;ref name="Dec6" /&gt; Suzanne Laplante-Edward and Jim Edward, the parents of one of the victims, were also deeply involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Boyd| first =Denny| title =Couple salvages purpose from their daughter's tragic death|page =B1|work=Vancouver Sun | date = April 20, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their activities, along with others, led to the passage of Bill C-68, or the [[Firearms Act, 1995|Firearms Act]], in 1995, ushering in stricter gun control regulations.&lt;ref name="Dec6" /&gt; These new regulations included requirements on the training of gun owners, screening of firearm applicants, rules concerning gun and ammunition storage and the [[Canadian gun registry|registration of all firearms]].  Between 2009 and 2012, survivors of the massacre and their families publicly opposed legislative actions by [[Stephen Harper]]'s [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] government aimed at ending the requirement to register non-restricted firearms (commonly referred to as the "long-gun registry").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Susan|last=Delacourt|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/734816--long-gun-registry-politics-taint-service-for-the-victims |title=Long-gun registry politics taint service for the victims |work=Toronto Star |accessdate=December 6, 2009 |date= December 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Violence against women===
The Canadian women's movement sees the massacre as a symbol of [[violence against women]]. "The death of those young women would not be in vain, we promised", Canadian feminist [[Judy Rebick]] recalled. "We would turn our mourning into organizing to put an end to male violence against women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Rebick| first =Judy| title = Where's the funding for abused women?| publisher =CBC| date = December 6, 2000| url =http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/columns/rebick/rebick001206.html | accessdate =March 7, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070321225539/http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/columns/rebick/rebick001206.html |archivedate = March 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the killings, a House of Commons Sub-Committee on the Status of Women was created. It released a report "The War against Women" in June 1991, which was not endorsed by the full standing committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Vienneau| first =David| title =Probe on violence toward women blocked| page =A4 |work=Toronto Star| date =January 19, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Hooks|first1=Tess|last2=LeClerc| first2= Patrice|last3= Beaujot|first3= Roderic|title=Female well-being: toward a global theory of social change|editor=Janet Mancini Billson, Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban|publisher=Zed Books|pages=102–103|isbn= 978-1-84277-009-2 |chapter= Women in Canada: a century of struggle| url=https://books.google.com/?id=a_2eWZK63_8C&amp;pg=PA102|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, following its recommendations, the federal government established the Canadian Panel on Violence Against Women in August 1991. The panel issued a final report, "Changing the Landscape: Ending Violence – Achieving Equality", in June 1993. The panel proposed a two-pronged "National Action Plan" consisting of an "Equality Action Plan" and a "Zero Tolerance Policy" designed to increase women's equality and reduce violence against women through government policy. Critics of the panel said that the plan failed to provide a workable timeline and strategy for implementation and that with over four hundred recommendations, the final report failed to make an impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Harder| first = Sandra | title = Violence against women: the Canadian Panel's final report | publisher = Government of Canada | url =http://publications.gc.ca/collections/Collection-R/LoPBdP/MR/mr122-e.htm | accessdate =February 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
====Failure to intervene====
[[File:Montreal massacre memorial at McMaster University.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Memorial at John Hodgins Engineering Building, [[McMaster University]]|alt= a roughly edged flat grey stone inscribed with the names of the women murdered, and dedicated by the engineering community at McMaster]]
Male survivors of the massacre have been subjected to criticism for not intervening to stop Lépine. In an interview immediately after the event, a reporter asked one of the men why they "abandoned" the women when it was clear that Lépine's targets were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lakeman |first=Lee |title=Women, Violence and the Montreal Massacre |publisher=Vancouver Rape Relief and Women's Shelter |url=http://www.rapereliefshelter.bc.ca/dec6/leearticle.html |accessdate=April 20, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419184040/http://www.rapereliefshelter.bc.ca/dec6/leearticle.html |archivedate=April 19, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[René Marc Jalbert|René Jalbert]], the [[Sergeant-at-Arms|sergeant-at-arms]] who persuaded Denis Lortie to surrender during his 1984 attack, said that someone should have intervened at least to distract Lépine, but acknowledged that "ordinary citizens cannot be expected to react heroically in the midst of terror."&lt;ref name="macleans" /&gt;  Right wing newspaper columnist [[Mark Steyn]] suggested that male inaction during the massacre illustrated a "culture of passivity" prevalent among men in Canada, which enabled Lépine's shooting spree: "Yet the defining image of contemporary Canadian maleness is not M Lepine/Gharbi but the professors and the men in that classroom, who, ordered to leave by the lone gunman, meekly did so, and abandoned their female classmates to their fate—an act of abdication that would have been unthinkable in almost any other culture throughout human history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Steyn |first=Mark| title = A Culture of Passivity| publisher = National Review| date = April 18, 2007 | url = http://www.nationalreview.com/article/220650/culture-passivity-mark-steyn| accessdate =April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male students and staff expressed feelings of remorse for not having attempted to prevent the shootings,&lt;ref name="cernea" /&gt; but Nathalie Provost, one of the survivors, said that she felt that nothing could have been done to prevent the tragedy, and that her fellow students should not feel guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Kastor| first =Elizabeth| title =In Montreal, A Survivor Heals After The Horror; 23-Year-Old Student Tried To Reason With Killer| newspaper =The Washington Post| page = B1|date =December 11, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interpretation====
The feminist movement is periodically criticized for appropriating the massacre as a symbol of male violence against women. For example, [[Charles Rackoff]], a [[University of Toronto]] [[computer science]] professor, compared the [[Ku Klux Klan]] with those organizing vigils marking the event, writing that "[t]he point is to use the death of these people as an excuse to promote the feminist/extreme left-wing agenda," and adding that it is "no more justified" than the KKK using the "murder of a white person by a black person as an excuse to promote their agenda."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = CBC news| title = Professor criticizes Montreal massacre memorials | publisher = CBC| date = December 7, 2000 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2000/12/07/massacre_email001207.html| accessdate =March 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other critics say that Lépine was a "lone gunman" who does not represent men, and that violence against women is neither condoned nor encouraged officially or unofficially in western culture. In this perspective, feminist memorializing is considered socially divisive on the basis of gender and therefore harmful by bestowing guilt on all men, irrespective of individual propensity to violence against women.&lt;ref name="kay"&gt;{{cite news| last = Kay| first = Barbara| title = Lone gunman: The Ecole Polytechnique massacre was a freak tragedy.

A memorial erected in Vancouver sparked controversy because it was dedicated to "all women murdered by men", which critics say implies all men are potential murderers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thetyee.ca/Life/2004/11/11/MagnetsforMemory/|title=Magnets for Memory|last=Campbell|first=Charles|date=November 11, 2004|publisher=The Tyee|accessdate=December 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, women involved in the project ironically received death threats and the Vancouver Park Board subsequently banned any future memorials that might "antagonize" other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingpeople.net/book_a_monument_to_canadian_wome.htm|title=Book a Monument to Canadian Women Murdered by Men|last=Cooper|first=Rachelle|date=April 19, 2006|publisher=at Guelph|accessdate=December 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gordonbrentingram.ca/scholarship/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/ingram-2000-contests-over-social-memory-in-waterfront-vancouver.pdf|title=Contests over social memory in waterfront Vancouver: Historical editing &amp; obfuscation through public art|last=Ingram|first=Gordon Brent|date=February 2, 2000|publisher=on the w@terfront|accessdate=December 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event has also been commemorated through references in television, theatre, and popular music. A play about the shootings by [[Adam Kelly]] called ''[[The Anorak]]'' was named as one of the best plays of 2004 by the ''[[Montreal Gazette]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appsci.queensu.ca/ilc/events/playwritingcomp/anorak.php|title=Stage Productions: The Anorak|publisher=Queen's University Faculty of Applied Science|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827224540/http://appsci.queensu.ca/ilc/events/playwritingcomp/anorak.php|archivedate=August 27, 2007|deadurl=unfit|accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Colleen Murphy|Colleen Murphy's]]  play "December Man" was first staged in Calgary in 2007&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/a-brutal-massacre-makes-for-a-delicate-art/article1054299/|title=A brutal massacre makes for a delicate art|last=Posner|first=Michael|date=10 April 2008|work=Globe and Mail|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The movie  [[Polytechnique (film)|''Polytechnique'']], directed by [[Denis Villeneuve]] was released in 2009, and sparked controversy over the desirability of reliving the tragedy in a commercial film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/Polytechnique+open+debate/1236248/story.html|title=Polytechnique: open to debate|last=Kelley|first=Brendan|date=January 1, 2009|work=[[Montreal Gazette]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418002308/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Polytechnique%2Bopen%2Bdebate/1236248/story.html|archivedate=April 18, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/related/topics/Montreal%2Bmassacre%2Bfilm%2Bbrings%2Bmany%2Bmemories/1228750/story.html|title=Montreal massacre film brings up 'too many memories'|last=Hamilton|first=Graeme|date=January 28, 2009|work=National Post|accessdate=November 7, 2010|archive-url=https://archive.is/20101023220959/http://www.nationalpost.com/related/topics/Montreal+massacre+film+brings+many+memories/1228750/story.html|archive-date=October 23, 2010|dead-url=yes|location=Canada|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several songs have been written about the events,  including "This Memory" by the folk duo the [[Wyrd Sisters (band)|Wyrd Sisters]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  and "6 December 1989" by the Australian singer [[Judy Small]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=_dnfAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT75&amp;lpg=PT75|title=Bodied Mindfulness: Women's Spirits, Bodies and Places|last=Tomm|first=Winnie|date=2010-10-30|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ.
