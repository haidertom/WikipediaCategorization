'''Ahl al-Hadith''' ({{lang-ar|أهل الحديث}}, "The people of [[hadith]]"; also ''Așḥāb al-ḥadīṯ''; {{lang|ar|أصحاب الحديث}}, "The adherents of [[hadith]]") first emerged in the 2nd/ 3rd Islamic centuries as a movement of [[hadith]] scholars who considered the Quran and authentic hadith to be the only authority in matters of law and creed.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Ahl al-Hadith|editor=John L.

In [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]] Ahl al-Hadith opposed contemporary jurists who based their legal reasoning on informed opinion (''ra'y'') or living local practice, referred to as [[Ahl ar-Ra'y]].&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt; In matters of faith, they were pitted against the [[Mu'tazilite]]s and other theological currents, condemning many points of their doctrines as well as the rationalistic methods they used in defending them.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130-131&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lapidus|2014|page=130-131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent leader of the movement was [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]].&lt;ref name=Lapidus130-131/&gt; Subsequently, all Sunni [[Madhhab|legal schools]] gradually came to accept the reliance on the Quran and hadith advocated by the Ahl al-Hadith movement,&lt;ref name=Lapidus130-131/&gt; while [[al-Ash'ari]] (874-936) used rationalistic argumentation favored by Mu'tazilites to defend most tenets of the Ahl al-Hadith doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Khalid |last=Blankinship| authorlink = Khalid Yahya Blankinship | year=2008 | title=The early creed |editor=Tim Winter|volume=The Cambridge Companion to Classical Islamic Theology|publisher=Cambridge University Press (Kindle edition)|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following centuries the term ''ahl al-hadith'' came to refer to the scholars, mostly of the [[Hanbali|Hanbali madhhab]], who rejected rationalistic theology (''[[kalam]]'') and held on to the early Sunni creed.&lt;ref name=Brown168&gt;{{Cite book|first=Jonathan A.C. |last=Brown| year=2009 | title=Hadith: Muhammad's Legacy in the Medieval and Modern World|publisher=Oneworld Publications (Kindle edition)|page=168| quote=In the wake of the tenth-century Ash'ari synthesis, some Muslim theologians still maintained the strict details of the early Sunni creed.

== Origins and general characteristics ==

The Ahl al-Hadith movement emerged toward the end of the eighth century CE among scholars of hadith who held the Quran and authentic hadith to be the only acceptable sources of law and creed.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lapidus|2014|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first these scholars formed minorities within existing religious study circles, but by the early ninth century they coalesced into a separate movement under the leadership of [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]].&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt; In legal matters, these scholars criticized the use of personal opinion (''ra'y'') common among the [[Hanafi]] jurists of Iraq as well as the reliance on living local traditions by [[Malikite]] jurists of [[Medina]].&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt; They also rejected the use of ''[[qiyas]]'' (analogical deduction) and other methods of jurisprudence not based on literal reading of scripture.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt; In matters of faith, they were pitted against [[Mu'tazilite]]s and other theological currents, condemning many points of their doctrines as well as the rationalistic methods they used in defending them.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt; Ahl al-Hadith were also characterized by their avoidance of all state patronage and by their social activism.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt; They attempted to follow the injunction of "[[Enjoining good and forbidding wrong|commanding good and forbidding evil]]" by preaching asceticism and launching vigilante attacks to break wine bottles, musical instruments and chessboards.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130/&gt;

== Convergence of legal schools ==
{{further|Fiqh|Madhhab}}

The next two centuries witnessed a broad convergence of legal methodologies which gave rise to the classical theory of Sunni jurisprudence (''[[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|uṣūl al-fiqh]]''). Hanafi and Maliki jurists gradually came to accept the primacy of the Quran and hadith advocated by the Ahl al-Hadith movement, restricting the use of other forms of legal reasoning to interpretation of these scriptures.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130-131/&gt; This "traditionalizing" of legal reasoning is exemplified in the work of [[Malik ibn Anas|Malik]]'s student [[Al-Shafi‘i]], which laid the foundation of the [[Shafi'i]] legal school.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130-131/&gt; In turn, Hanbali jurists, who led the traditionalist movement and initially opposed the use of qiyas, gradually came to accept it as long as its application was strictly founded on scriptural sources.&lt;ref name=Lapidus130-131/&gt;

== Creed ==
{{main|Traditionalist Theology (Islam)}}

Ahl al-Hadith believed that the ''[[Zahir (Islam)|zahir]]'' (literal, apparent) meaning of the Qur'an and the hadith have sole authority in matters of faith and that the use of rational disputation is forbidden even if it verifies the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Halverson|2010|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not attempt to conceptualize the meanings of the Qur'an rationally, accepting them without asking "how" (''[[bi-la kaifa]]''), and asserted that their realities should be consigned to God alone (''[[tafwid]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Halverson|2010|page=36-37}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that every part of the Qur'an is uncreated (''ghayr makhluq'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agwan|first1=A. R.|last2=Singh|first2=N. K.|title=Encyclopedia of the Holy Qur'an|date=2000|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|isbn=8187746009|page=678}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Melchert, Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, Oneworld Publ., 2006, p 154&lt;/ref&gt; Ahl al-Hadith also held that ''[[Iman (concept)|iman]]'' (faith) increases and decreases in correlation with the performance of prescribed rituals and duties, such as the five daily prayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Halverson|2010|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert W. Mason, Humaniora Islamica, Volume 1, p 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theological controversies ==
{{Salafi}}
{{main|Traditionalist Theology (Islam)}}

In 833 the caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] tried to impose Mu'tazilite theology on all religious scholars and instituted an inquisition (''[[mihna]]'') which required them to accept the Mu'tazilite doctrine that the Qur'an was a created object, which implicitly made is subject to interpretation by caliphs and scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Blankinship|2008|page=49}}; {{Harvtxt|Lapidus|2014|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Hanbal led traditionalist resistance to this policy, affirming under torture that the Quran was uncreated and hence coeternal with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Blankinship|2008|pages=49, 51}}; {{Harvtxt|Lapidus|2014|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Mu'tazilism remained state doctrine until 851, the efforts to impose it only served to politicize and harden the theological controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Blankinship|2008|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; This controversy persisted until [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari]] (874-936) found a middle ground between Mu'tazilite rationalism and Hanbalite literalism, using the rationalistic methods championed by Mu'tazilites to defend most tenets of the Ahl al-Hadith doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Blankinship|2008|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A rival compromise between rationalism and traditionalism emerged  from the work of [[al-Maturidi]] (d. c. 944), and one of these two schools of theology was accepted by members of all Sunni [[madhhab]]s, with the exception of most Hanbalite and some Shafi'i scholars, who ostensibly persisted in their rejection of kalam, although they often resorted to rationalistic arguments themselves, even while claiming to rely on the literal text of scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Blankinship|2008|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the scholars who rejected the [[Ash'ari]]/[[Maturidi]] synthesis were in the minority, their emotive, narrative-based approach to faith remained influential among the urban masses in some areas, particularly in Abbasid Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Berkey|2003|page=2081–2091 (Kindle locations)}}; {{Harvtxt|Halverson|2010|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Ash'arism and Maturidism are often called the Sunni "orthodoxy", traditionalist theology has thrived alongside it, laying rival claims to be the orthodox Sunni faith.&lt;ref name="Brown 2009 page=180"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brown|2009|page=180}}: "The Ash‘ari school of theology is often called the Sunni ‘orthodoxy.’ But the original ahl al-hadith, early Sunni creed from which Ash‘arism evolved has continued to thrive alongside it as a rival Sunni ‘orthodoxy’ as well."&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era it has had a disproportionate impact on Islamic theology, having been appropriated by [[Wahhabi]] and other traditionalist [[Salafi]] currents and spread well beyond the confines of the Hanbali school of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hoover|2014|page=625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Albanian School of Magistrates'', officially known as the '''School of Magistrates of the Republic of Albania''' ({{lang-al|Shkolla e Magjistraturës së Republikës së Shqipërisë}}, '''ASM''') is an Albanian post-graduate school, where Albanian [[judge]]s and [[public prosecutor]]s are trained. The institution was established in 1997 by virtue of Law no. 8136, date 31.7.1996 “On the School of Magistrates of the Republic of Albania”, as amended by Law no. 9414, date 20.05.2005 and Law no. 97/2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magjistratura.edu.al/49-faqe.html?lang=2#103 Brief presentation of Activities of the School]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is located in [[Tirana]], with its campus located inside the [[Tirana Park on the Artificial Lake|Tirana Grand Park]], sharing premises with the Faculty of Geology and Mining of the [[Polytechnic University of Tirana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magjistratura.edu.al/49-faqe.html?lang=2#103 Brief presentation of Activities of the School]&lt;/ref&gt;

== School Activities ==
The aim of the training provided by the ASM is to form a corps of judges and public prosecutors who are suitable for all posts on the bench as well as in the public prosecution service in first instance courts. A prospective Judge or Public prosecutor must complete a Bachelor in Law (which typically requires three years of study) and a Master in Law (which requires two years of study) before entering the School of Magistrates.  Admission is made through a two-part entrance examination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magjistratura.edu.al/media/users/8/Broshura.ang.docx English Brochure of the School]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Albanian School of Magistrates offers:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magjistratura.edu.al/49-faqe.html?lang=2#103 Brief presentation of Activities of the School]&lt;/ref&gt;

· Initial professional theoretical and practical education of candidates for magistrate (who select either the Judicial or the Prosecutorial stream);

· Professional continuous formation of judges and prosecutors in function of general character, combined with the specialized formation for professionals who are in duty in such courts as the administrative court, the serious crimes court, as well as of the sections of courts which are focused into the judgment of specific matters, such as commercial sections, bankruptcy sections, task force of the prosecution, etc.;

· the realization of the activities of the professional formation of the employees of the judicial administrate, as well as of other professions related with the justice system, in accordance with the law or on the request of interested institutions, in dependence of free capacities, as well as of the funds it has in disposal from responsible institutions or donors;

· Editions and publications;

· Scientific research and preparation of analysis, memo and expertise from Legal and Scientific Clinics of the School of Magistrates, (candidates for magistrate under the observation of their professors), in the support of the judicial institutions, such as the High Court, the Constitutional Court and the General Prosecutor’s Institution, as well as in the support of the drafting process for the Parliament and the Ministry of Justice.

== Initial training ==
The Initial Training Formation of candidates for magistrates is made up of a period of three years, which comprises:

a) A theoretical year with different law subjects;

b) A practical year under the guide of a school professor and under the guide of a judge or prosecutor with high qualifications.

c) A professional internship year dealing with less complicated cases under the guidance of a prosecutor or a judge;

The first year theoretical program is common for all candidates whereas the second practical year and the third year of professional internship are carried out according to the careers of each of the candidates, judges or prosecutors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5339">'''Andrei Ivanovich Bogdanov''' ({{lang-ru|Андрей Иванович Богданов}}) (1692 – September 11, 1766) was one of the first  [[Russia]]n [[bibliography|bibliographers]] and [[Ethnography|ethnographers]].

Andrei Bogdanov had studied at Academician [[gimnasium]] (a gimnasium of [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]). His father was a gunpowder-maker and Andrei had assisted him in his work. In 1727 according to [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great's]] edict Bogdanov began work at the field of typographical art.
&lt;!--
'''Андре́й Ива́нович Богда́нов'''в (1692 — 11 сентября 1766, [[Санкт-Петербург]]) — один из первых русских [[Библиография|книговедов]]. Учился в гимназии при [[Петербургская Академия наук|Петербургской Академии Наук]]. Отец его был мастером порохового дела и Андрей Иванович помогал ему, пока указом [[Пётр I|Петра I]] от 1719 года не был определен «в службу к типографскому художеству». Далее работал в Санкт-Петербургской типографии, а после 1727 года — в типографии Академии Наук. С 1730 года Андрей Иванович работал в библиотеке Академии наук. 

Труд Андрея Ивановича Богданова ''«Историческое, географическое и топографическое описание Санкт-Петербурга от начала заведения его, с 1703, по 1751 год»''  —  первое дошедшее до нас произведение, в котором собраны сведения по [[География|географии]], [[Топонимика|топонимике]], административной структуре, населению Санкт-Петербурга. Это по сути энциклопедия столичной жизни первой половины XVIII века.

'''Arvind Sharma''' is the Birks Professor of Comparative Religion at [[McGill University]]. Sharma's works focus on [[comparative religion]], [[Hinduism]], [[philosophy of religion]] and the role of women in religion. Some of his more widely read works include ''Our Religions'' and ''Women in World Religions'', which were edited by him. ''Feminism in World Religions'' was selected as a [[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice]] Outstanding Academic Book (1999).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.students.emory.edu/HSC/sharma.html Dr. Arvind Sharma], Emory University Hindu Students Council, retrieved 2015-04-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography== 
Arvind Sharma was born on the 13th of January 1940 in [[Varanasi]], [[India]] . Raised in a family that traditionally worked in the [[Indian Administrative Service]] (IAS), he followed suit and joined the IAS in 1962 after a distinguished academic career. 

He served in the State of Gujarat until 1968, when he moved to the United States to pursue higher studies in economics at the [[University of Syracuse]], obtaining a Masters in economics in 1970.  While pursuing the role of non-economic factors in economic development he became interested in religion and joined Harvard Divinity School in 1972.  After obtaining a Masters in Theological Studies, concentrating on comparative religion, he earned his PhD from the Department of Sanskrit and Indian Studies in 1978.  His doctorate work involved the first ever translation in English of Abhinavagupta's commentary on the Bhagavad Gita.

While at Harvard he was recruited in 1976 by the newly founded Department of Studies in Religion at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. In 1980 he moved to the University of Sydney, from where he was hired by McGill University in Canada in 1987.  In 1994 he was appointed the Birks Professor of Comparative Religion at McGill University, where he continues to teach as of 2018.

The '''Bachelor of Computer Science''' or '''Bachelor of Science in Computer Science''' (abbreviated '''BCompSc''' or '''BCS''' or '''BS CS''' or '''B.Sc. CS''') is a type of [[bachelor's degree]], usually awarded after three or four years of collegiate study in [[computer science]], but possibly awarded in fewer years depending on factors such as an institution's course requirements and academic calendar. In some cases it can be awarded in five years. In general, computer science degree programs emphasize the mathematical and theoretical foundations of computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uowdubai.ac.ae/computer-science-and-engineering-programs/bachelor-of-computer-science-bcompsc-degree |title=Bachelor of Computer Science (BCOMPSC) Degree |publisher=[[University of Wollongong in Dubai]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same core curriculum may, depending on the school, result in other degrees, including:
* [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) in Computer Science 
* Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) in Computer Science
* Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering (B.Tech)
* Bachelor of Science in Information Technology 
* Bachelor of Mathematics in Computer Science  
* Bachelor of Engineering (BEng or BE) in Computer Science 
* Bachelor of Computing in Computer Science 
* [[Bachelor of Science]] in Engineering (Computer Science) - BSE (CS)
* Bachelor of Computer Security in Computer Science
* Bachelor of Science (BSc or BS) in Computer Science (BSc CS or BSCS or BSc (Comp)

In many post-secondary institutions, an '''Honors Bachelor of Computer Science''' degree has been introduced as an upgrade to the regular bachelor's program and usually requires at least one additional year of study.

==Typical requirements==
Because computer science is a wide field, courses required to earn a bachelor of computer science degree vary. A typical list of course requirements includes topics such as:&lt;ref

'''Bachelor of Music''' is an [[academic degree]] awarded by a [[college]], [[university]], or [[music school|conservatory]] upon completion of a program of study in [[music]]. In the United States, it is a [[professional degree]], and the majority of work consists of prescribed music courses and study in applied music, usually requiring proficiency in an instrument, voice, or conducting. In Canada, the B.M. is often considered an [[undergraduate]] degree. Programs typically last from three to four and a half years.

The degree may be awarded for [[performance]], [[music education]], [[musical composition|composition]], [[music theory]], [[musicology]] / [[music history]] (musicology degrees may be a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A.) rather than a B.M.) [[music technology]], [[music therapy]], sacred music, music business/[[music industry]], entertainment, [[music production (music industry)|music production]] or [[jazz]] studies. In the 2010s, some universities have begun offering degrees in Music Composition with Technology, which include traditional theory and musicology courses and [[sound recording]] and composition courses using digital technologies.

In the United Kingdom, the Bachelor of Music is generally a [[undergraduate degree|first degree]] lasting three years (or four years in Scotland) and consisting of a wide range of areas of study (normally including performance, composition, music theory, musicology/music history), but at the [[University of Oxford]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/examregs/14-33_General_Regulations.shtml Regulations for the degrees of Bachelor and Doctor of Music] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019042411/http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/examregs/14-33_General_Regulations.shtml |date=2008-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[University of Cambridge]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cam.ac.uk/guide/summary/mus.html Bachelor of Music (MusB)]&lt;/ref&gt; it is a one-year [[postgraduate]] degree which can only be taken if a student is a graduate in music with [[Honors degree|honors]] at those universities; the undergraduate course is in the [[Faculty of Arts]] and leads to the Bachelor of Arts (and subsequently the [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)]]).

==Abbreviations==
After a degree holder's name, as on a [[business card]] or a [[Curriculum vitae|CV]], the degree is abbreviated in various ways, including: B.M., BM, B.Mus, BMus, Mus.B, or Mus.Bac. Some recipients add an abbreviation for the name of the institution which granted the degree as well, e.g., "Susan Bhattara, B.Mus. (Oxon)"; ''Oxon'' being the Latin abbreviation for [[Oxford University]].

==Post-graduation options==
Graduates may apply for jobs in performance, teaching, or [[arts administration]]. As well, graduates can apply for jobs which require a bachelor's degree in every subject, such as some entry-level jobs in banking, insurance, sales, and administration. Graduates with an interest in teaching in the school system may go on to complete a [[teaching degree]] or diploma. Graduates who have achieved a high standard on their instrument, voice, or another specialization such as composition or conducting may be eligible to apply for a [[Master of Music]] (M.M.) if their grades are high enough (a B+ or A- average is typically required). B.M. graduates can also apply to a range of graduate programs outside of music, such as library science, [[business administration]] or [[public administration]]; a B+ or A- average is typically required. Some programs may require B.M. graduates to complete preparatory or make-up courses in the field of the master's. As well, some programs require the [[GRE]] or [[GMAT]] (standardized tests). B.M. graduates in some fields, such as composition, music theory, or musicology may be able to apply directly to [[Ph.D]] programs if they have a high average and strong recommendation letters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13521">The '''biophilia hypothesis''' also called BET suggests that humans possess an innate tendency to seek connections with [[nature]] and other forms of life.&lt;ref&gt;"biophilia hypothesis." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite.  Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. O. Wilson|Edward O. Wilson]]  introduced and popularized the hypothesis in his book, ''Biophilia'' (1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Edward O.|title=Biophilia|year=1984|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]|isbn=0-674-07442-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He defines biophilia as "the urge to affiliate with other forms of life".&lt;ref&gt;Kellert &amp; Wilson 1995, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Love of living systems ==
The term "biophilia" means "love of life or living systems." It was first used by [[Erich Fromm]] to describe a [[Erich Fromm|psychological orientation]] of being attracted to all that is alive and vital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fromm|first=Erich|title=The Heart of Man|year=1964|publisher=[[Harper &amp; Row]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson uses the term in the same sense when he suggests that biophilia describes "the connections that human beings subconsciously seek with the rest of life." He proposed the possibility that the deep affiliations humans have with other life forms and nature as a whole are rooted in our biology. Unlike [[phobia]]s, which are the aversions and fears that people have of things in their environment, [[philia]]s are the attractions and positive feelings that people have toward organisms, species, habitats, processes and objects in their natural surroundings. 
Although named by Fromm, the concept of biophilia has been proposed and defined many times over. Aristotle was one of many to put forward a concept that could be summarized as "love of life". Diving into the term ''philia'', or friendship, Aristotle evokes the idea of reciprocity and how friendships are beneficial to both parties in more than just one way, but especially in the way of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;SANTAS, ARISTOTELIS. "Aristotelian Ethics And Biophilia." Ethics &amp; The Environment 19.1 (2014): 95-121. GreenFILE. Web. 24 Feb. 2015 http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=2ed69cd6-0f3e-47aa-b03a-a284b3619652%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=116&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Children and Nature: Psychological, Sociocultural, and Evolutionary Investigations'' edited by Peter Kahn and Stephen Kellert,&lt;ref name="childrennature"&gt;{{cite book|title=Children and nature: psychological, sociocultural, and evolutionary investigations|first=Peter |last=Kahn|first2=Stephen |last2=Kellert|year=2002 |publisher=[[MIT Press]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCjdKjI_qIcC&amp;pg=PA153|isbn=0-262-11267-1 |page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; the importance of animals, especially those with which a child can develop a nurturing relationship, is emphasized particularly for early and middle childhood. Chapter 7 of the same book reports on the help that animals can provide to children with autistic-spectrum disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Animals in Therapeutic Education: Guides into the Liminal State|first=Aaron|last=Katcher|title=Children and Nature: Psychological, Sociocultural, and Evolutionary Investigations|year=2002|editor1-last=Kahn|editor1-first=Peter H.|editor2-last=Kellert|editor2-first=Stephen R|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCjdKjI_qIcC&amp;pg=PA179|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-11267-1|accessdate=January 30, 2013|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product of biological evolution ==
Human preferences toward things in [[nature]], while refined through experience and culture, are hypothetically the product of biological evolution. For example, adult mammals (especially humans) are generally attracted to baby mammal faces and find them [[Cuteness|appealing]] across species. The large eyes and small features of any young mammal face are far more appealing than those of the mature adults.

Similarly, the hypothesis helps explain why ordinary people care for and sometimes risk their lives to save domestic and wild animals, and keep plants and flowers in and around their homes. In other words, our natural love for life helps sustain life.

Very often, flowers also indicate potential for food later. Most fruits start their development as flowers. For our ancestors, it was crucial to spot, detect and remember the plants that would later provide nutrition.

==Biophilia and conservation==
Because of our technological advancements and more time spent inside buildings and cars, it is argued that the lack of biophilic activities and time spent in nature may be strengthening the disconnect of humans from nature. Although, it also has shown strong urges among people to reconnect with nature. 
The concern for a lack of connection with the rest of nature outside of us, is that a stronger disregard for other plants, animals and less appealing wild areas could lead to further ecosystem degradation and species loss. Therefore, reestablishing a connection with nature has become more important in the field of conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rogers|first1=Kara|title=Biophilia Hypothesis|url=http://www.britannica.com/science/biophilia-hypothesis|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |accessdate=10 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=February 2016}} Examples would be more available green spaces in and around cities, more classes that revolve around nature and implementing smart design for greener cities that integrate ecosystems into them such as biophilic cities. These cities can also become part of wildlife corridors to help with migrational and territorial needs of other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biophilic Cities | url=http://biophiliccities.org|website=Biophilic Cities|accessdate=10 Mar 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The hypothesis has since been developed as part of theories of [[evolutionary psychology]] in the book ''The Biophilia Hypothesis'' edited by Stephen R. Kellert and Edward O. Wilson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kellert|first=Stephen R. (ed.)|title=The Biophilia Hypothesis|publisher=[[Island Press]]|year=1993|isbn=1-55963-147-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Lynn Margulis]].  Also, Stephen Kellert's work seeks to determine common human responses to perceptions of, and ideas about, plants and animals, and to explain them in terms of the conditions of human evolution.

==Biophilic design==
In [[architecture]], biophilic design is a [[sustainable design]] strategy that incorporates reconnecting people with the natural environment. It may be seen as a necessary complement to [[Sustainable architecture|green architecture]], which decreases the environmental impact of the built world but does not address human reconnection with the natural world.&lt;ref name="kellert-film"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stephenrkellert.net/biophilic-design.html | title=Biophilic Design: The Architecture of Life | work=www.stephenrkellert.net | accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Caperna and Serafini,&lt;ref&gt;Caperna A., Giangrande A., Mirabelli P., Mortola E., (2013). Partecipazione e ICT. Gangemi Editore  [http://www.gangemieditore.com/dettaglio/partecipazione-ict/4248/2] {{ISBN|9788849225365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biophilic architecture is characterized by the following elements: i) the naturalistic dimension; (ii) the Wholeness &lt;ref&gt;C. Alexander, [[The Nature of Order|The Nature of Order: An Essay on the Art of Building and the Nature of the Universe]], Center for Environmental Structure, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; of the site, that is, "the basic structure of the place"; (iii) the "geometric coherency", that is, the physical space must have such a geometrical configuration able to exalt the connections human dimension and built and natural environments.
Similarly, biophilic space has been defined as the environment that strengthens life and supports the sociological and psychological components,&lt;ref&gt;	Serafini, S. (2009).

(ii) foster the optimum of our sensorial system in terms of neuro-motorial influence, avoiding both the depressive and the exciting effects; (iii) induce a strengthening in emotive and biological terms at a neural level; (iv) support, according to the many clinical evidences, the neuro-endocryne and immunological system, especially for those people who are in bad physical condition.

Having a window looking out to plants is also claimed to help speed up the healing process of patients in hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nature-that-nurtures/ Windows looking out to plants helping the healing process]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, having plants in the same room as patients in hospitals also speeds up their healing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=19715461 | doi=10.1089/acm.2009.0075 | volume=15 | title=Ornamental indoor plants in hospital rooms enhanced health outcomes of patients recovering from surgery | year=2009 | journal=J Altern Complement Med | pages=975–80 | last1 = Park | first1 = SH | last2 = Mattson | first2 = RH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biophilia in fiction==
Canadian author [[Hilary Cunningham Scharper|Hilary Scharper]] explicitly adapted [[E. O. Wilson|E.O. Wilson]]'s  concept of biophilia for her ecogothic novel, ''Perdita''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Arousing Biophilia|url = http://arts.envirolink.org/interviews_and_conversations/EOWilson.html|website = arts.envirolink.org|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the novel, Perdita (meaning "the lost one") is a [[mythology|mythological figure]] who brings biophilia to humanity.

'''Carbon Process Management (CPM)''' is a management process which promotes environmental effectiveness in organizations. It is designed to maximize efficiencies in the consumption of resources that contribute to climate change. When implemented effectively, CPM techniques can reduce operating costs, realizing gains in [[brand equity]], competitive advantage and stakeholder value. Initially introduced by [[First Carbon Solutions]], CPM uses [[Kaizen|Japanese kaizen]] philosophy which continuously improves workplace practices to reduce wastage, this is combined [[Business process management|business process management (BPM)]] which increases efficiency. Governments who resorts to legal mechanisms and regulation to deal with the risks of climate change, techniques such as CPM are directed towards a corporate approach in helping reduce [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Carbon management and sustainability  | url=http://www.firstcarbonsolutions.com/ | work= First Carbon Solutions | accessdate=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Outsourcing 2010: Green growth, public sector deals and rise of the SME |url=http://www.silicon.com/technology/it-services/2010/01/12/outsourcing-2010-green-growth-public-sector-deals-and-rise-of-the-sme-39745317/ |work=Silicon, a CBS Interactive Limited |accessdate=2010-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323065152/http://www.silicon.com/technology/it-services/2010/01/12/outsourcing-2010-green-growth-public-sector-deals-and-rise-of-the-sme-39745317/ |archivedate=2010-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Going green |url=http://www.bworldonline.com/main/content.php?id=5871 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221516/http://www.bworldonline.com/main/content.php?id=5871 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-09-23 |work=Business World Online |accessdate=2010-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= What is your carbon footprint?  | url= http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=551149&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=85 | work=Philippine Star | accessdate=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

Established in 1965, Central Department of Chemistry is one of the first science department that has been commenced by Tribhuvan University as a branch of Tri-Chandra Campus for the beginning of advanced course of Science in Nepal,  which only provided the course in Organic Chemistry then.&lt;ref&gt;http://tribhuvan-university.edu.np/&lt;/ref&gt;
It has then ever since growing and extending its scope far beyond what has been in the start and currently enrolling the students for  Masters of  Chemistry degree as chief authority also  conducting entrance examinations, enrolling students,  running research activities as leader and pioneer in many interdisciplinary subjects and variations of chemistry  throughout the country, running with an affiliation. It has extended its branches at Bharatpur, Biratnagar, Pokhara, Tri-Chandra College and recently at ASCOL.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cdctu.edu.np/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Tribhuvan University was established by promulgating the Tribhuvan University Act in 1959. TU has commenced teaching, research, and other academic activities from July 14, 1959. The teaching of Chemistry in Nepal, however, had already commenced in 1921 in Tri-Chandra College, with the introduction of Intermediate of Science (I.Sc.) program. It was then upgraded to Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) level in 1947. Master's Degree in Chemistry was started only from November 28, 1965 initially at Tri-Chandra College with the introduction of a program in Organic Chemistry. The program was conducted under the ''lecturer-in-Charge-ship'' of Late Professor Prasanna Man Singh Pradhan, the then Head of the Chemistry Department of Tri-Chandra College. This historical step also pioneered the introduction of research initiatives in Chemistry in Nepal.

The present Chemistry building within the University Campus was constructed on August 17, 1966 and inaugurated on July 16, 1967. The Central Department of Chemistry then started to function in its own building at the University complex.

Master's degree programs in Inorganic Chemistry and Physical Chemistry were introduced in 1966 and 1967, respectively. Late Professor Dr. Dhruba Man Singh Amatya was formally appointed as the first Head of the Department in 1966 and he remained to that post up to 1984. After him, Prof. Dr. S.P. Dhoubadel (1984/10/28 - 1984/11/25), Prof. Dr. C.L. Gajurel (1984/11/26 - 1985/08/31 and 1987/04/11 - 1987/11/05), Prof. J.K. Shrestha (1985/09/01 - 1987/03/31 and 1987/11/06 - 1994/06/05), Prof. Dr. M.D. Manandhar (19894/06/06 - 2002/06/01), Prof. Dr. R.R. Pradhananga (2002/06/06 - 2007/12/12), and Prof. Dr. T.P. Pathak (2007/12/13 - 2009/08/31) were appointed as Head of the Central Department of Chemistry during the period in between 1984-2009. Recently, Prof. Dr. Kedar Nath Ghimire has resigned from the post and Prof. Dr. Megh Raj Pokhrel has been leading the Department as the Head since 2014.

Since the establishment, the department has extended its courses on various subjects with amendment each year. The latest being Biochemistry, Natural Product Chemistry, Electro-chemistry, Nanotechnology, Polymer science, etc. Since 2013, the department has adopted a semester system which previously succeeded by year basis as major campuses here in Nepal do such.
The total quota of students for each year was 90 and after being converted to semester system, the quota has been limited to 45 per semester effectively maintaining the identical seats over the year.

'''''Climate Research''''' is a small [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] published by the Inter-Research Science Center that was established in 1990. Its founder and long time publisher was marine biologist [[Otto Kinne]].&lt;ref name=info&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.int-res.com/journals/cr/about-the-journal/ |title=Inter Research » Journals » CR » Information |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the climate research community, the journal is mostly known for its 2003 publication of a controversial and now discredited climate change article.

Three volumes, each typically containing half a dozen articles, are published each year. Each of its 12 editors therefore handles an average of less than 2 articles a year. ''Climate Research'' covers all aspects of the interactions of climate with organisms, [[ecosystem]]s, and human societies. In 2006, a special issue of the journal, titled "Advances in Applying Climate Prediction to Agriculture", was published under [[Open access (publishing)|open access]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://start.org/programs/climag|title=Climate Prediction and Agriculture (CLIMAG)|accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/cr/v33/n1/|title=CR - Vol. 33, No. 1 - Table of contents|date=December 21, 2006|accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in July 1985, the '''Energy Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences''' (ERIRAS) was originally an outgrowth of the general energy department at [[Institute for High Temperatures RAS]] (IVTAN).  The staff at the newly formed organization comprised professionals gathered from other scientific organizations.  At the time of its creation, ERIRAS’ challenge was to develop the basic content and quantitative substantiation for the Energy Program of the USSR.  The first director of ERIRAS was [[Lev Aleksandrovich Milentyev]], an Academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  At present, Academician [[Aleksei Aleksandrovich Makarov]] is the director of the Institute. 

== Organization ==
The Institute employs approximately 80 staff members, of whom 65% are highly skilled specialists.  It comprises eight scientific departments: 

*the Laboratory for the study of the interconnections between economics and energy
*the Laboratory for the study of the improvement of energy consumption and energy savings
*the Laboratory for the modeling of [[energy market]]s
*the Laboratory for research on the methodology of energy policy development 
*the Laboratory for the study of the regulation and development of oil and gas systems
*the Laboratory for the study of the regulation and development of electricity and heat systems
*the Laboratory for the study of the regulation and development of the coal industry
*the Centre for the study of international energy markets

The Institute deploys a matrix organizational structure in order to maximize flexibility.  Thus, different departments can work together jointly and each can be modified according to the circumstances.

== Activities ==
The Institute’s mission is to find solutions to a wide range of contemporary challenges including: 
efficient energy production and consumption techniques to promote energy savings; appropriate pricing mechanisms for energy markets; and legislation, tax policy and other general issues related to domestic energy policy.

ERIRAS work is divided into the following research areas:

*the study of the regularities of energy development 
*the modeling of energy development
*the theory and methods of energy system studies 
*the creation of a scientific basis for energy policy and the mechanisms for its implementation 
*the identification of the rational spheres and magnitudes of energy savings, and the mechanisms for energy saving policy implementation which take into consideration environmental concerns
*the study of the priorities in energy technical policy
*the identification of rational mechanisms for the regulation of energy development within a market framework, including primary legislation, pricing techniques, and tax and investment policy
*the forecasting of energy markets
*the creation of a scientific basis for the development of the oil &amp; gas industry
*the creation of a scientific basis for the development of the energy sectors (electricity &amp; heat)
*the creation of a scientific basis for the development of the coal industry

The Institute’s work is based on complex mathematical modeling, a unique database, and advanced computer technologies.

Today, ERIRAS is a major scientific center that is at the forefront of fundamental and applied research.  The knowledge produced by ERIRAS provides the basis for energy development forecasting and policy in Russia, the CIS, and for international energy markets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4303">As introduced by [[Kurt Lewin]], '''genidentity''' is an ''existential relationship'' underlying the genesis of an object from one moment to the next. What we usually consider to be an object really consists of multiple entities, which are the phases of the object at various [[time]]s. Two objects are not identical because they have the same properties in common, but because one has developed from the other. 
Lewin introduced the concept in his 1922 [[Habilitationsschrift]] ''Der Begriff der Genese in Physik, Biologie und Entwicklungsgeschichte''. It is today perhaps the only surviving evidence of Lewin's influence on the philosophy of science. However, this concept never became an object of widespread discussion and debate in its own terms. Rather, it was extracted from its context by philosophers such as [[Rudolf Carnap]], Hans Hermes, [[Hans Reichenbach]], [[Adolph Grünbaum]], and [[Bas van Fraassen]] who incorporated this concept into their own theories such as the [[topology of the universe]] or the axiomatization of [[mechanics]]. Lewin's idea was to compare and contrast the concept of genidentity in various branches of science, thereby laying bare the characteristic structure of each and making their classification possible in the first place. 

== Classification of Natural Sciences ==

In his thesis mentioned above, Lewin compares [[physics]] (in which he includes [[chemistry]]) and [[biology]] (which he divides into organic biology and [[evolutionary history of life]]). A comparison of this kind presupposes that it is possible to find equivalent notions in both sciences. According to Lewin, the concept of ''genidentity'' in the various sciences meets this requirement.

Lewin distinguishes between partial and total genidentity. This is due to the difficulty caused by parts of objects: for instance, an object might disintegrate into several pieces in the course of its development. As we follow such an object through time, only a small portion of it may remain. Lewin says that two objects existing at different times are partly genidentical if at least some part of the later object was present in the earlier object. By contrast, he says that two objects are totally genidentical if and only if at neither of the considered times there is any distinct object partially genidentical to one of the two objects concerned. 

Lewin also introduces the idea of viewing physical bodies as links in a so-called ''development chain''. According to this approach, between two totally genidentical objects there always exists, at any intermediate time, an object totally genidentical with each. Thus genidentity implies the existence of an entire infinite series of intermediate objects. In this Lewin sees an analogy between physical objects and [[real number]]s, as defined by so-called [[Dedekind cut]]s in the ordering of [[rational number]]s. 

Genidentity so defined is postulated to have various characteristics, such as symmetry, transitivity, density, and continuity. When reviewed in the light of contemporary standards of logical precision, it becomes clear that Lewin had the correct intuition, even though he did not have the benefit of a highly developed terminology of definition theory or modern day [[symbolic logic]]. 

However, genidentity has never been explicitly discussed in the experimental sciences. Rather, it has always been a basic assumption hovering in the background, tacitly assumed. The credit for having made these assumptions explicit for the first time doubtlessly belongs to Kurt Lewin, usually renowned for his psychological work in the field of [[Gestalt psychology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31818">The phrase "'''greed versus grievance'''" or "'''greed and grievance'''" refer to the two baseline arguments put forward by scholars of [[armed conflict]] on the causes of [[civil war]], though the argument has been extended to other forms of [[war]], such as violent conflict in general, rebellion and insurgency for example.

"Greed" is shorthand for the argument that combatants in armed conflicts are motivated by a desire to better their situation, and perform an informal [[cost-benefit analysis]] in examining if the rewards of joining a [[rebellion]] are greater than not joining. "[[Grievance]]" stands for the argument that people rebel over issues of identity, e.g. [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], [[social class]], etc., rather than over [[economics]]. In practice, even proponents of strong versions of these arguments admit that the opposing argument has some influence in the development of a conflict.

Whether the cause of war is attributed to 'greed' or 'grievance' the common factor is the perception of a certain deprivation. If it is an economic deprivation, the inequality will be a '[[vertical inequality]]' and the cause of war will be 'greed'. If the deprivation is caused by ethnicity, age, religion or gender, it will be a '[[horizontal inequality]]' and the cause of war will be due to the 'grievances'. 

== Cornerstones ==
The "greed versus grievance" theory provides opposing arguments on the cause of civil war. Proponents of the greed argument posit that armed conflicts are caused by a combatant's desire for self-enrichment. These motivations are manifested in multiple ways, including economic gain through control of goods and resources or by increased power within a given state. Conflicts started through greed are often seen in states with negative economic growth and/or systemic poverty, as this implies limited state capacity to provide opposition groups with economic concessions as well as the likelihood of the absence of an effective military or police apparatus to contend with those seeking power or resources.

Paul Collier and Anke Hoeffler wrote one of the seminal pieces defending greed over grievance. They found that factors that increase the military or financial viability of rebellion correlated with more instances of conflict than factors leading to grievances. They argue that certain natural resources such as oil are tied to increased likelihood of conflict onset, and other natural resources such as diamonds are tied to increases in conflict duration. This is because natural resources may lower the startup cost of war, and provide rebels with an easy way of financing prolonged conflicts. Natural resources may also make the state a more lucrative prize for capture, further decreasing the opportunity cost of insurgency. For the same reason, Collier and Hoeffler also conclude that states with low per capita GDP are more likely to experience civil war, because low average income makes wage earning through conflict a more lucrative prospect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collier and Hoeffler also make an important distinction between preferences and constraints in terms of circumstances that favor rebellions. Societies can be more prone to conflict because preferences for rebellion are unusually strong or because constraints on rebellion are unusually weak – the former being aligned with grievance and the latter with greed. Measures such as democracy or political repression are hard to draw conclusions from because they may increase grievances among some groups, but empower other groups to repress potential insurgents. While most states harbor some level of grievance with the sitting regime, few states experience civil war. This is because although not everyone is content with the established order, rebellion only occurs when conflict is a viable option for dissatisfied parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Collier and Hoeffler conclude that on their own most variables that seek to explain civil war onset through measurements of grievance alone prove insufficient. Instead Collier and Hoeffler advocate using the looking at greed, that is to say the opportunity cost of initiating and sustaining conflict. [[James Fearon|Fearon]] and Laitin (2003) offer a contrasting view. They see opportunity structures created by weakness state capacity to be a cause of civil war onset. They find evidence in favor of the technology of insurgency as a mechanism. Further, they find that ethnicity, religion or any cultural or demography characteristic do not seems to have a positive relationship with civil war onset.&lt;ref&gt;'''Fearon, James D. and Laitin, David D'''. "Ethnicity, Insurgency and Civil War." ''American Political Science Review'', 2003, 97(1), pp 75-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Financing combatants is crucial to the success of any rebellion. Extortion and donations from diasporas are two possible financial sources used by rebellion groups. The extortion of primary commodity resources is especially suited to the operations of rebel groups, as they are often made up of unskilled labor and given whatever weapons are available. As rebel organizations need to be fairly large to have a significant impact and incite a civil war, the looting of primary commodity resources is the best way for them to maintain financial viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this include diamonds in Sierra Leone and Angola, timber in Cambodia, coca in Colombia, and poppy in Afghanistan. Another factor that relates to lower constraints on rebellion is that primary resources are often found in rural locales. Thus, they often require an army to defend a large area, something that is much less likely in weak states that cannot sustain a military apparatus.&lt;ref name="Collier_7"&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diaspora populations are also likely funding sources for rebel groups, as was the case with the Tamil population in North America funding the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka. Diaspora populations, who are usually wealthier than their native counterparts, are able to mobilize for collective action, and do not directly suffer the consequences of a conflict. While the potential for diasporas to be financial backers of rebel groups was noted, Collier and Hoeffler found that diasporas themselves do not increase the risk of conflict.&lt;ref name="Collier_8"&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Overall, Collier and Hoeffler's study drew multiple conclusions in support of the greed model. Faster economic growth reduces risk, likely because it raises the opportunity costs of joining a rebellion. The higher a state's dependence on primary commodities, the greater the risk of conflict; this is due to the resources being a main financial component of rebel groups and a weak governmental structure. However, they observed that if there is a particularly high dependence on primary commodity resources, conflict risk declines as states find ways to protect their resources and deter looting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
David Keen elaborates on the economic incentives for warfare and argues that there is more to war than simply "winning." In some instances, it could be more beneficial for certain parties to prolong war, so long as they are in control of economic resources or power positions. This can become common in states with weak rule of law where violence becomes privatized.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Keen|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elite groups within weak states attempt to harness economic agendas and resources within a given civil society and are motivated to create private profit by mobilizing violent means. Keen continues by citing various possible economic functions of violence.
 
His first example of violent means to promote economic gain is pillaging, whether to gain resources or to supplement or supply wages of soldiers. Another function is extortion of protection money from people who can afford it so they can be spared violence inflicted upon them. A third economic function is the monopolistic control of trade. When state control breaks down, trade that was previously prohibited is more easily facilitated and has the potential to generate substantial amounts of profit for those involved. Primary examples of this are weapons and drugs. A fourth function of conflict is the possible exploitation of labor. The threat of violence can be used to coerce cheap or free labor, with extreme cases resulting in forms of slavery. A fifth short-term function is the ability to stake a claim to land and its resources. Similar to Collier and Hoeffler's argument that weak states cannot easily maintain control over their natural resources due to their rural location and potentially wide dispersion, it is economically beneficial to assert control over minimally defended, resource-rich areas. Extracting benefits from aid that is sent to a conflict area is also beneficial for rebel groups as there are often possibilities to raid resources sent from abroad. Appropriation of aid becomes difficult in a weak state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Keen|2000|pp=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
Unlike Collier, Keen does not attribute conflict to be driven more by greed than by grievance; he stresses how the two forces interact so that greed generates grievances and rebellion, which in turn legitimizes further greed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Keen|2000|pp=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keen uses the conflict perpetuated by Milosevic in Serbia as an example of how an extended, endless conflict is preferable to one with a definitive end and a clear winner. Milosevic controlled the media to create grievances among the Serbian population, rally them together, and create a common enemy following NATO bombing. The small group of elites surrounding Milosevic perpetuated conditions that warranted international sanctions in order to better control trade and loot resources. Milosevic realized sanctions were necessary to facilitate the profitable black market transactions that were being made by those closest to him. Had he demobilized or embraced a more peaceful policy, the sanctions would have been lifted and his economic advantage would have disintegrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Keen|2000|pp=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is what Keen was referring to in his argument that greed and grievance are often tied together and interact with one another. In this way, Milosevic's initial desire for power spurred him to create grievances amongst the Serbs that created the popular support for his sanction-warranting policies to further his economic and political power – the use of grievances to produce further greed.

The strong case for the "greed" argument was made by [[Paul Collier]] and Anke Hoeffler in a study they performed for the [[World Bank]] at the turn of the millennium. Since then, the Collier-Hoeffler Model has been the focus of much of the greed-grievance debate.

One of the leading critics on the 'greed' argument is [[Frances Stewart (economist)|Frances Stewart]]. In her article 'Horizontal Inequalities: A neglected Dimension of Development' she stresses the need to focus on the grievances of the populations since too much focus on inequality between individuals is dangerous for successful development. By using nine case studies she proves how horizontal inequalities have led to violent conflict. 

=== Case study: Afghanistan ===
In south central Asia, along the lawless Afghani-Pakistani border a group called the Taliban have been engaging in what could best be described as a greed based insurgency since 2001. The Taliban's insurgency is in opposition to the NATO and United States supported Afghan transitional government of Hamid Karzai. This brief case study will provide concrete examples of the factors that compose the Greed Model. 
	
One of the primary characteristics of a Greed-based conflict as listed above is the ability to derive income or revenue from natural resource predation.&lt;ref name="Collier_7"/&gt; This requires the presence of a "lootable" resource. In the case of the Taliban insurgency, this resource is the opium poppy. Afghanistan supplies the majority of the world's opium, the market share being as high as 90% in the years directly following the NATO invasion.&lt;ref&gt;BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS AND LAW ENFORC. "2012 INCSR: Country Reports - Afghanistan through Costa Rica."&lt;/ref&gt; The high volume, high revenue nature of the Afghan opium market allows the Taliban to "loot" the resource at every stage of development, from cultivation to heroin sale. Benefits from opium production begin for the Taliban with imposing a 10% tax on farmers growing opium (a protection fee), followed by control over heroin labs and heroin sales to smugglers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peters|2009|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taliban, like FARC before them also blur the line between membership to the Taliban and membership to the transnational group of opium smugglers, therefore allowing the insurgency to reap financial rewards from the price bump that comes when the smuggler crosses an international border. In these ways the Taliban are able to fund their insurgency and begin to fall under the characterization of a group of actors in pursuit of greed based conflict.

A second component of the Greed Model is the presence of a large diaspora funding the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; If we use the traditional definition of a diaspora, the Taliban do not have one. However, they have two extraterritorial means of support based on ethnic affiliation. One comes from funding from wealthy Arabs in the Middle East. This revenue source has been relatively under-researched as the funds are coming from individuals rather than an ethnic bloc.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Walsh. "Taliban raked in $400 million from diverse sources-UN." Reuters, September 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrasting the diffuse nature of the Arab funding, the Taliban receive considerable support from their Pakistani Pashtun brethren. Pashtun influence has a large impact on the Afghan insurgency. Pakistan's role encompasses a number of characteristics important to the greed model; ethnic homogeneity, a supply of unskilled labor, and lawless borderlands. Collier and Hoeffler discuss the idea that diversity makes conflict more difficult as it is harder to mobilize a heterogeneous ethnic base into rebellion.&lt;ref name="Collier_11"&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Pashtun ethnic group that straddles the Afghani-Pakistani border is anything but diverse. This allows the Taliban to rapidly acquire recruits. In addition, many Pashtuns in the region are uneducated and poor. This provides the Taliban with another requirement for greed based rebellion; unskilled workers who can fill out security and infantry requirements. The insecurity and lack of formal state governance over the Afghan south-east and the Pakistani west also makes a significant contribution to the robustness of a greed based argument here. The mountainous region between the two states is an ideal hiding place for insurgents and also provides many circuitous avenues for smuggling heroin.

Pakistan's influence in Afghanistan extends beyond the simple trans-border ethnic affiliation. Gretchen Peters cites a strained relationship with its Pakistani neighbors as a problem limiting the success of the Karzai government. Pakistan's government is hostile towards the Afghan transitional government because the transitional government is backed and heavily influenced by international entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Peters|2009|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the Inter-Service Intelligence Agency (ISI) of Pakistan has been known to directly support the Taliban with funding, tip offs, and the corruption of government officials.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Waldman. "The sun in the sky: the relationship between Pakistan's ISI and Afghan insurgents", p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This constitutes the greed model factor of extraterritorial governmental support for an insurgency laid out by Collier.&lt;ref name="Collier_8"/&gt;

The final explanatory feature important to the Taliban's insurgency as a greed-based rebellion is the influence of a previous rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Collier|Hoeffler|2002|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the support of the CIA and ISI the young Taliban in the 1990s were pitted against the Soviet Union in proxy war. This enabled the Taliban to do a number of things. They became involved in opium trade, were provided with weapons, and began to construct the organizational aptitude that allows for their continued success today.&lt;ref&gt;Namit Arora. "America, the Cold War, and the Taliban."&lt;/ref&gt; The previous involvement of the Taliban in an armed insurgency allows one of the issues with a greed-based insurgency to be dismissed. Collier and Hoeffler assert that the government has an innate advantage in greed-based conflicts as the government is more organized.&lt;ref name="Collier_11"/&gt; However, in the case of the Afghan conflict this is not true. The transitional government is more fractionalized, less cooperative, and more ethnically divided than the Taliban. Therefore, using the greed-model we should actually expect the Taliban to defeat the transitional government after NATO's withdrawal, as the government possesses few advantages.

This case shows the explanatory power of the greed model, enabling a better understanding of what the variables look like in the real world. In the Afghan case there haven't been many successes in peace building. As the following section will illustrate, the greed model is not without holes or needed additions, but the Taliban insurgency can definitively be characterized as an actor motivated primarily by the conditions that foster the greed model.

Probably the most coherent rebuttal of Collier's work comes from [[David Keen]], articulated in his book ''Complex Emergencies''.


=== Case study 2: Sri Lanka ===
Sri Lanka is an island country in South Asia that suffered from a violent civil war for more than 25 years. The fighting took place between the majority of the Buddhist Sinhalese population and the minority Hindu Tamils. This brief case study will demonstrate how the civil war was caused by horizontal inequalities and how it therefore supports the 'grievance' argument. 

Injustices can be seen across different ethnic groups. When the people from a certain ethnic group perceive that they are being given less opportunities by the government simply because they belong to that ethnic group, in terms of education and economy for example, it creates grievances. These grievances, which are called horizontal inequalities, lead to violent conflict. The war that took place in Sri Lanka was due to the perceived grievances that the Tamil population experienced during Sinhalese rule. 

Sri Lanka -then called Ceylon- was under British colonial rule from 1815 to 1948&lt;ref name=thoughtco&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Sri Lankan Civil War|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/the-sri-lankan-civil-war-195086|website=ThoughtCo|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Even though the majority of the population was Buddhist Sinhalese, with over three million people, the British people favored the Hindu Tamils, which accounted to 300,000 people. The Tamil population therefore enjoyed privileged access to education and to government employment&lt;ref name=stewart&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stewart|first1=Frances|title=Working Paper Number 81 Horizontal Inequalities: A Neglected Dimension of Development|date=February 2002|volume=Working Paper number 81|issue=QEH Working Paper Series – QEHWPS81|pages=40|url=http://www3.qeh.ox.ac.uk/pdf/qehwp/qehwps81.pdf|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They held around 40% of University places in science and engineering, medicine and agriculture and veterinary science&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt;. The appointment of Tamils to bureaucratic positions angered the Sinhalese population and when Great Britain granted Ceylon independence in 1948, the Sinhalese majority aimed at correcting these horizontal inequalities perceived as disadvantageous to them. They made Sinhalese the official language, which drove the Tamils out of the civil service and incorporated educational quotas. The result was an increase on the Sinhalese incomes and a drop in those of the Tamil, which eliminated the previous differential between the two groups&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt;. However, by the end of the 1970s, Sinhalese were gaining more places at University and because civil service recruitment policies, such as the use of Sinhalese in examinations favored the Sinhalese, their recruitment in relation to population was four times more favorable than that of the Tamils&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt;. 

While the initial aim was to correct the horizontal inequalities perceived by the Sinhalese population, the result was that instead of just correcting them, they introduced them in their favor. This meant that the Tamil population now felt economically and politically excluded and threatened. As seen, these horizontal inequalities translated into grievances and it was these grievances that allowed extremist leaders to exploit the growing resentment to gain support and start a violent conflict. 

After years of ethnic tensions, the violence was initiated by an insurgent group called the Tamil Tigers, who declared the ‘First Eelam War (1983-87) with the aim of creating a separate Tamil state in northern Sri Lanka&lt;ref name=thoughtco/&gt;. The peacekeepers sent by India in 1987 did little to stop the violence and they were forced to retire in 1990. It was then that the Tamil Tigers initiated what they called the second Eelam War, which was even bloodier than the first. Horrible atrocities were committed by both sides, including the use of child suicide bombers and child soldiers and it was not until 2009 that the Sri Lankan government declared victory over the Tamil Tigers&lt;ref name=thoughtco/&gt;. It is estimated that at least 100,000 died during the conflict&lt;ref name=thoughtco/&gt;. 

As seen, the Tamil Tigers did not start violent conflict due to greed. It was grievances such as a perceived disadvantage over education possibilities, work opportunities, language use and economic prospects that increased the ethnic tensions between the two groups and drove the Tamil Tigers to start a war. 

While there is no doubt that war causes poverty and that once war has broken out it feeds on economic deprivation and underdevelopment, one cannot declare the ‘greed’ argument as a sole explanation of violent conflict. Poverty does not cause war directly, so the greed argument is not strong enough. It is the grievances perceived by a group within a society that drives violent conflict. These grievances do include economic deprivation but also ethnic discrimination, age and gender. As seen with Sri Lanka, these factors are more likely to drive conflict since they also provide a specific environment where charismatic leaders can pick on the grievances and create a sense of group membership that facilitates the outbreak of war.

=== Critiques===
There are many works that rebut the idea of greed vs. grievance. Authors set up alternative ideas that need to be introduced and explored. Even the staunchest proponents of the Greed vs. Grievance theory believe that other outside forces (beyond the greed and/or grievance) can have an effect on conflict, which makes the critiques all the more vital in understanding the theory itself. One of the most prevalent authors in rebutting greed vs. grievance is author David Keen, in his book ''Complex Emergencies''.
	
David Keen, a professor at the Development Studies Institute at the London School of Economics, has several innovative and new ideas regarding the ideas of war.&lt;ref&gt;T. Allen. "Complex emergencies and humanitarian responses." University of London: International Issues (2012): 2-17.&lt;/ref&gt; His work is considered by many to be one of the leading arguments against greed vs. grievance theory. His ideas look into the specifics of complex emergencies, which is a term officially defined by the InterAgency Standing Committee (IASC) as:
"A multifaceted humanitarian crisis in a country, region or society where there is a total or considerable breakdown of authority resulting from internal or external conflict and which requires a multi-sectoral, international response that goes beyond the mandate or capacity of any single agency and/or the ongoing UN country program. Such emergencies have, in particular, a devastating effect on children and women and call for a complex range of responses."&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (2008). OCHA Glossary of Humanitarian Terms 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Keen discusses how a conflict can never be simply a greed scenario. His definition of a "complex emergency" demonstrates this broader term and all of its various implications. 
	
In his book, Keen goes into several different conflict scenarios, such as 'war', 'famine', and 'information', and then sets up an argument against the idea of greed. He believes that although a conflict, whether it be the 'War on Terror' or the conflict in Sierra Leone, may be centered around some concept of greed or grievance, this can never solely explain a conflict. Although seemingly obvious, Keen looks to demonstrate that, "the aims in a war are complex".&lt;ref name="complex"&gt;David Keen. "Complex Emergencies: David Keen Responds" African Arguments: Royal African Society.&lt;/ref&gt; He does not believe that greed and grievance can be examined separately, but rather that they are partner terms that must be implemented in a complementary way. For example, when Keen discusses the conflict in Sudan, he says, " the grievances of northern pastoralists were useful for a government trying to get its hands on oil in areas that famine and militia attacks helped to depopulate; meanwhile, the 'greed' of the Arab militias themselves (for labour, cattle and land) was itself intimately linked to their grievances".&lt;ref name="complex"/&gt; He makes it clear that it is necessary to first spend ample time defining the type of conflict at hand because the differences between genocide and a civil war are substantial, so it is necessary to diagnose the incentives and solutions for the conflict with a mix of multiple theories. 
	
Keen specifically critiques Paul Collier, a leading expert in greed vs. grievance theory, by claiming that Collier became too comfortable with "numbers", and needed to rely more on the actual opinions of people involved in conflicts. He spoke of Collier's work and said, "This is where econometrics tips over into arrogance and starts closing down the possibility of a genuine understanding of conflicts or, by extension, of a political settlement that addresses underlying grievances".&lt;ref name="complex"/&gt; He doesn't believe that it can be dismissed so easily. He was documented saying, "It also annoys me that a lot of the 'scientific air' of the Collier work is quite bogus as the selection of proxies is so arbitrary", which demonstrated a distinct attack on Collier's work, which emphasizes quantitative data.&lt;ref name="complex"/&gt;

David Keen is one of the major critics of greed vs. grievance theory, defined primarily by Paul Collier, and argues the point that a conflict, although he cannot define it, cannot be pinpointed to simply one motive. He believes that conflicts are much more complex and thus should not be analyzed through simplified methods. He disagrees with the quantitative research methods of Collier and believes a stronger emphasis should be put on personal data and human perspective of the people in conflict. This isn't necessarily a complete dismissal of the greed vs. grievance theory, but rather a critique on its polarity and methods of data collection. 
	
Beyond Keen, several other authors have introduced works that either disprove greed vs. grievance theory with empirical data, or dismiss its ultimate conclusion. Authors such as Cristina Bodea and Ibrahim Elbadawi, who co-wrote the entry, "Riots, coups and civil war: Revisiting the greed and grievance debate", argue that empirical data can disprove many of the proponents of greed theory and make the idea "irrelevant".&lt;ref&gt;Christina Bodea. "Riots, coups and civil war : revisiting the greed and grievance debate." Policy Research 1 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; They examine a myriad of factors and conclude that too many factors come into play with conflict, which cannot be confined to simply greed or grievance. 
	
Anthony Vinci makes a strong argument that, "fungible concept of power and the primary motivation of survival provide superior explanations of armed group motivation and, more broadly, the conduct of internal conflicts".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Vinci. "Greed-Grievance Reconsidered: The Role of Power and Survival in the Motivation of Armed Groups." Civil Wars "8(1)" (2007): 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Knot]]s and '''knotting''' have been used and studied throughout '''[[history]]'''. For example, [[Chinese knotting]] is a decorative handicraft art that began as a form of Chinese folk art in the Tang and Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD) in China, later popularized in the Ming. [[Knot theory]] is the recent mathematical study of [[unknot]]s.

Knots of ancient origin include the [[bottle sling]], [[bowline]], [[cat's paw (knot)|cat's paw]], [[clove hitch]], [[cow hitch]], [[double fisherman's knot]], [[eskimo bowline]], [[figure-eight knot]], [[fisherman's knot]], [[half hitch]], [[kalmyk loop]], [[one-sided overhand bend]], [[overhand knot]], [[overhand loop]], [[reef knot]], [[running bowline]], [[single hitch]], [[thief knot]], [[Turk's head knot]], and [[two half-hitches]].

The eleven main knots of Chinese knotting are the four-flower knot, six-flower knot, [[Chinese button knot]], [[Matthew Walker knot|double connection knot]], [[carrick bend|double coin knot]], agemaki, [[friendship knot|cross knot]], square knot, Plafond knot, [[endless knot|Pan Chang knot]], and the good luck knot.

Knots of more recent origin include the [[friendship knot]] of Chinese knotting. The [[sheepshank|sheepshank knot]] originates from 1627 while the [[Western Union splice]] originates from the beginning of [[telegraphy]].

'''Hyperdrama''' is a dramatic performance generated by playscripts written in [[hypertext]]. The performance is noted for its split narrative with scenes branching to play simultaneously in an expanded performance space. The audience is mobile, able to follow actors and watch scenes as each individual chooses.

According to [[Astrid Ensslin]] in her book ''Canonizing Hypertext''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Canonizing Hypertext|last = Ensslin|first = Astrid|publisher = Continuum|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-8264-9558-7|location = |pages = 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Continuum, London, 2007), the term hyperdrama "was coined by hyperdramatist and theorist Charles Deemer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ibiblio.org/cdeemer/hdrama.htm|title = Hyperdrama|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; who understands 'traditional drama as a special case of hyperdrama' (p27)." Ensslin places Deemer's one-act hyperdrama ''The Last Song of Violeta Parra''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ibiblio.org/cdeemer/chile-m.html|title = The Last Song of Violeta Parra|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the canon of "first generation hypertext." Deemer also has written a hyperdrama expansion of Chekhov's ''The Seagull''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Seagull Hyperdrama|last = Deemer|first = Charles|publisher = Sextant Books|year = 2004|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Harvard’s The American Repertory Theater and [[Punchdrunk]] performed ''[[Sleep No More (2009 play)|Sleep No More]],'' "a [http://www.ibiblio.org/cdeemer/newhype.htm hyperdrama] rendition of ''Macbeth'' with a creepy, Hitchcock feel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://htlit.com/archives/October2009/SleepNoMore.html|title = Sleep No More|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Hannah Rudman, who wrote "[http://www.consultrudman.com/benefactor-play/ The Benefactor: a Hyperdrama]" in 1998 with Dr Billy Smart, describes the form this way: "A hyperdrama is a play that is written in hypertext, that is performed as a promenade and that is realised on multiple levels. Scenes happen simultaneously throughout a performance space. In this hyperdrama, there are five different locations where the action takes place. The scripts for the different locations are divided into levels which represent the time span of the piece (about 45 minutes real time). All the characters and locations in this hyperdrama are of equal importance. As a reader, you could follow the path of one character through the play by clicking on their hypertext links; read all the separate scripts in a linear fashion; or explore the hyperdrama more randomly by swapping between rooms via the hotlinks."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.consultrudman.com/benefactor-play/|title=The Benefactor: a Hyperdrama|last=Rudman|first=Hannah|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell Anderson, author of ''Woyzeck: a Hyperdrama,'' calls his play "a performance in &lt;span class="a"&gt;the ‘hyperdrama’ format: that is, where multiple elements of performance occur in multiple locations simultaneously."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.academia.edu/10351971/Woyzeck_a_Hyperdrama|title = Woyzeck: a Hyperdrama|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tegan Zimmerman uses the presentation software [[Prezi]] to explore "Hypertext and Hyperdrama" and their relationship online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://prezi.com/3bj3w8y4eq2d/hypertext-and-hyperdrama/|title = Hypertext and Hyperdrama|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other hyperdrama works of note are ''[[Tamara (play)|Tamara]]'' by John Krizanc, which had a long run in Los Angeles in the 1980s, and ''[[Tony and Tina's Wedding]]'', perhaps the most widely produced and popular hyperdrama.

A number of universities have added the study of Hyperdrama to their hypertext and electronic media studies: the University of Virginia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/courses/ensp481/syllabus.html|title = Syllabus|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tunxis Community College,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tunxis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Hyperdrama08-syllabus-14-22.pdf|title = Course Syllabus|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; New York University,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nyu.edu/classes/keefer/TimeSpace/timespace.html|title = Writing: Time and Space|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; among them.

Discussion of hyperdrama is included in the book ''Theatre In Cyberspace'' (Peter Lang, 1999): "theatre practitioners are increasing their potential audiences with online technology while attempting to discover how to present theatre in an interactive yet non-corporeal way. Also fascinating is how educators and practitioners can collaborate, creating online performance spaces that can be adapted for teaching, and creating online teaching techniques that can be adapted for performance. This volume of essays presents information from some of the pioneers in the field of cyberspace theatre who write of their work in both theoretical and practical terms, thus creating a kind of ''Theatre and Its Double'' for computers and theatre."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&amp;seitentyp=produkt&amp;pk=44689 |title=Peter Lang Publishers |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222151510/http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&amp;seitentyp=produkt&amp;pk=44689 |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Industry funding of academic research in the United States''' is one of the two major sources of funding in academia along with government support. Currently, private funding of research accounts for the majority of all research and development funding in the United States as of 2007 overall.&lt;ref name=CBO2007&gt;https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/82xx/doc8221/06-18-research.pdf{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Federal and Industrial sources contribute similar amounts to research, while industry funds the vast majority of development work.&lt;ref name="CBO2007" /&gt; 

While the majority of industry research is performed in-house, a major portion of this private research funding is directed to research in non-profit academic centers.&lt;ref name=NBK215472&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=McGeary |editor2-first=Kathi E. |editor2-last=Hanna |year=2004 |chapter=Sources of Funding for Biomedical Research |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK215472/ |title=Strategies to Leverage Research Funding |isbn=0-309-09277-9 |pages=37–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1999, industrial sources accounted for an estimated $2.2 billion of academic research funding in the US.&lt;ref name=NBK215472/&gt; However, there is little governmental oversight or tracking of industry funding on academic science and figures of the scale of industry research are often estimated by self-reporting and surveys which can be somewhat unreliable.

Much of this industry funding of academic research is directed toward applied research. However, by some accounts, industry may even fund up to 40% of basic research in the United States, with Federal funding of basic research falling below 50%, although this figure does not consider where this research is conducted.&lt;ref name="science.aal0890"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.aal0890 |title=Data check: U.S. Government share of basic research funding falls below 50% |journal=Science |year=2017 |last1=Mervis |first1=Jeffrey }}&lt;/ref&gt; The role for funding of academic research from industrial sources has received much attention both in a historical and contemporary perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.290.1.113 |pmid=12837722 |title=Industry Funding of Clinical Trials: Benefit or Bias? |journal=JAMA |volume=290 |issue=1 |pages=113–4 |year=2003 |last1=Chopra |first1=S. S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice has received both extensive political praise and scholarly criticism.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==History==
Research in the US prior to World War II, heavily relied on funding from private sources without major organized federal research programs or either the scientists’ or associates’ personal funds. During World Wa&lt;s&gt;r&lt;/s&gt; II, governmental investment in research was widely regarded as a major contributor to military success and support for research was politically favorable.&lt;ref name=NBK235736&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK235736/{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following WW2, federal research funding in both Europe and the US increased in terms of relative percent of funding for research and absolute amount.&lt;ref name=NBK235736/&gt; Overall, the growth of industrial research funding has greatly outpaced public research funding growth, with US governmental research funding increasing by an average of 3.4% annually, while industrial research funding increased by an average of 5.4% annually from 1950 to 2004.&lt;ref name=CBO2007/&gt; 

Since WW2, industry funding of science has consistently represented the second largest source of funding for academic science.&lt;ref name=Jahnke&gt;{{cite web |first=Art |last=Jahnke |date=April 6, 2015 |title=Who Picks Up the Tab for Science? |url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2015/funding-for-scientific-research/ |work=BU Today }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry funding of academic science did expand during the 1980s and 1990s following the passing of the Bayh-Dohl Act and a variety of both State and Federal proposals to increase funding for joint industry academic partnerships.&lt;ref name=Cohen1994&gt;{{cite book |first1=Wesley |last1=Cohen |first2=Richard |last2=Florida |first3=W Richard |last3=Goe |title=University-Industry Research Centers in the United States: Final Report to the Ford Foundation |publisher=H. John Heinz III School of Public Policy and Management, Center for Economic Development |year=1994 |oclc=249390310 }}{{page needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s there has been a small retraction of industry funding for academic science while overall industry R&amp;D funding has expanded.&lt;ref name=Jahnke/&gt; ). However, industry funding may be broadening its scope as industry funding of basic science increasing dramatically over that same period, but much of this funding remains in-house.&lt;ref name=science.aal0890/&gt;

Culturally, attitudes towards the industrial funding of academic research have changed over time. Within universities, commercial activities and industry funding were often spurned in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/652016 |pmid=20380344 |title=The Professional and the Scientist in Nineteenth-Century America |journal=Isis |volume=100 |issue=4 |pages=699–732 |year=2009 |last1=Lucier |first1=Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, commercializing scientific activity is viewed more favorably with extensive political and university support of translating scientific discovery into economic output. However, within the research community and the public, industrial funding of research remains controversial. The universality of this tangled industry, academic, and governmental exchange of funding and research adventures has led researchers to term this model of R&amp;D the Triple Helix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(99)00055-4 |title=The dynamics of innovation: From National Systems and 'Mode 2' to a Triple Helix of university–industry–government relations |journal=Research Policy |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=109–23 |year=2000 |last1=Etzkowitz |first1=Henry |last2=Leydesdorff |first2=Loet }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of industrially funded academic research ==
University-industry partnerships can take on a variety of forms. On the smallest scale, individual research labs or researchers can partner with industry sources for funding. The details of such partnerships can differ substantially with any number of motives ranging from the academic lab testing of previously developed products, to performing early stage basic research related to industry research objectives, or even to individual researchers supporting their salary by consulting on related research problems in industry.&lt;ref name=Lucier2008&gt;https://muse.jhu.edu/book/3500{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many such partnerships exist, due to their informal nature and resulting lack of record, it is difficult to track how extensive and impactful such relationships are, with most relying on surveys and other self-reporting measures. By closest approximation, according to the Research Value Mapping Survey, 17% of academics at major US research universities report receive grants from industry sources supporting their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.respol.2007.01.007 |title=Impacts of grants and contracts on academic researchers' interactions with industry |journal=Research Policy |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=694–707 |year=2007 |last1=Bozeman |first1=Barry |last2=Gaughan |first2=Monica }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Far more extensively, in many fields and countries, a narrow majority of academic scientists report having some soft industry relationships, primarily through consulting.&lt;ref name="Perkmann2013"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.respol.2012.09.007 |title=Academic engagement and commercialisation: A review of the literature on university–industry relations |journal=Research Policy |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=423–42 |year=2013 |last1=Perkmann |first1=Markus |last2=Tartari |first2=Valentina |last3=McKelvey |first3=Maureen |last4=Autio |first4=Erkko |last5=Broström |first5=Anders |last6=d'Este |first6=Pablo |last7=Fini |first7=Riccardo |last8=Geuna |first8=Aldo |last9=Grimaldi |first9=Rosa |last10=Hughes |first10=Alan |last11=Krabel |first11=Stefan |last12=Kitson |first12=Michael |last13=Llerena |first13=Patrick |last14=Lissoni |first14=Franceso |last15=Salter |first15=Ammon |last16=Sobrero |first16=Maurizio }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.28.6.1814 |pmid=19887423 |pmc=3767010 |title=Participation of Academic Scientists in Relationships with Industry |journal=Health Affairs |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=1814–25 |year=2009 |last1=Zinner |first1=D. E |last2=Bolcic-Jankovic |first2=D |last3=Clarridge |first3=B |last4=Blumenthal |first4=D |last5=Campbell |first5=E. G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such informal industry academic relationships have a long-standing tradition as they served as a major source of funding for individual labs prior to WW2. In many cases, it was expected that researchers would pursue such relationships as this was expected to be a major source of funding for researcher’s salaries.&lt;ref name="Lucier2008" /&gt; Despite greatly expanded post-WW2 federal support for research, so called soft money salary support from industry remains a large and growing aspect of academic research salaries.&lt;ref name="Perkmann2013" /&gt;

=== University Industry Research Centers (UIRCs) ===
On a larger scale, there have been numerous attempts to create collaborative University-Industry Research Centers (UIRCs) to jointly host academic and industry researchers to address industry problems with direct, large scale collaborative centers. Early forms of UIRCS started in the 1950s and 1960s with the formation of research parks with industry sponsors. In the 1970s, there were multiple proposals at the federal level in the US to help fund and expand early UIRCs. However, funding fell through at multiple points.&lt;ref name="Berman2012"&gt;https://press.princeton.edu/titles/9619.html{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first UIRCs experienced difficulties in bridging the differences between academic and industrial culture. One such attempt occurred at Cal Tech where Cal Tech researchers partnered with Xerox and IBM through the Silicon Structures Project.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/capsca_000202
{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both industry and academic partners were concerned about the cultures of the other and found the structure ineffective.&lt;ref name="Perkmann2013" /&gt; With such frustrations, it was difficult to secure partners to continue expanding UIRCs.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In the late 1970s, RPI created two three new UIRCs: 1) the Center for Integrated Computer Graphics, which received both NSF and industry support 2) the Center for Manufacturing Productivity and Technology Transfer, which was funded entirely by industry support and 3) the Center for Integrated Electronics, which received unprecedented industry support.&lt;ref name="Berman2012" /&gt; These centers were generally regarded as highly successful and made expansion of governmental support for joint industry and academic ventures more favorable. In the early 1980s, states began contributing funding to UIRCs and other industry-academic partnerships to encourage local economic growth from innovation. By the mid-1980s, the federal government expanded financial support for UIRCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/016224399602100303 |jstor=689710 |title=The Emergence of a Competitiveness Research and Development Policy Coalition and the Commercialization of Academic Science and Technology |journal=Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=303–39 |year=2016 |last1=Slaughter |first1=Sheila |last2=Rhoades |first2=Gary }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With mixed governmental and industry support, the UIRCs were more likely to be successful. Over time successful governmentally funded UIRCs could become independent from government support once having demonstrable successes that could continue to incentivize industry to contribute funding more aggressively.&lt;ref name="Berman2012" /&gt; UIRCs, coupled to early seeding from both state and federal government, continued to greatly expand during the 1980s and early 1990s, eventually receiving nearly 70% of industry funding of academic research and incentivizing a tripling of industry funding of academic research during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Cohen1994" /&gt;

=== Contract Research Organizations (CROs) ===
Contract research has also drawn increasing industry funding, particularly to Contract Research Organizations (CROs) from Biotech and Pharmaceutical corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00136504 |jstor=3446795 |title=Contract research, the university, and the academic |journal=Higher Education |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=665–82 |year=1985 |last1=Crawshaw |first1=Bruce }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contract research is a popular form of outsourcing research in industry as industry has more influence over how the study is conducted than in either UIRCs or traditional academic grants. CROs, which are specifically designed for this function have drawn substantial industry clinical research funding away from academia and are growing rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=23424323 |pmc=3571008 |year=2005 |author1=Carroll |first1=J |title=CRO Crowing About Their Growth |journal=Biotechnology healthcare |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=46–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and criticisms==
Much discussion has been placed on the effects of industrial research funding on the behavior of academic research scientists. Concerns center on whether researchers can remain impartial when they are being funded by a for-profit and potentially motivated industrial source, if this funding gives private sources an oversized impact on which research directions are pursued, and the potential negative effects of industrial funding on the openness of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(99)00112-2 |title=Unintended consequences of cooperative research: Impact of industry sponsorship on climate for academic freedom and other graduate student outcome |journal=Research Policy |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=179–99 |year=2001 |last1=Behrens |first1=Teresa R |last2=Gray |first2=Denis O }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A multitude of studies have found that pharmaceutical studies funded by industry organizations are significantly more likely to publish results in favor of the product being supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.01.010 |title=How pharmaceutical industry funding affects trial outcomes: Causal structures and responses |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=66 |issue=9 |pages=1909–14 |year=2008 |last1=Sismondo |first1=Sergio }}&lt;/ref&gt; This could, in part, be due to the fact that usually when an academic accepts industry funding, particularly when working on an existing product, researchers have to sign non-disclosure agreements which often prevent the publication of negative results and inhibit the openness of science.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/04/public-universities-get-an-education-in-private-industry/521379/{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could serve to significantly bias scientific results and diminish public trust of science.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

There are additionally many scholars who have considered advantages of industrially funded academic research. Generally, increased industry funding may increase academic and industry interaction, prompting greater efficiency in translating and commercializing of science research. This increased commercialization activity from academics could serve as an economic and societal boost as the economy could be bolstered by new products hitting the market, while society could benefit directly from having increased access to the fruits of scientific production. Supporting this, academic science funded by industry sources does result in more patents per dollar, increased licensing of these patents, and even more citations per published paper than research supported by other sources, including federal at the University of California Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/507297a |pmid=24654278 |title=Technology transfer: Industry-funded academic inventions boost innovation |journal=Nature |volume=507 |issue=7492 |pages=297–9 |year=2014 |last1=Wright |first1=Brian D |last2=Drivas |first2=Kyriakos |last3=Lei |first3=Zhen |last4=Merrill |first4=Stephen A }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Germany, it also appears that applied research funded by industry sources results in a significant increase in patent citations, which could correspond to a serious increase in translation of applied research.&lt;ref name=Hottenrott2011&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-6435.2011.00519.x |title=Industry Funding of University Research and Scientific Productivity |journal=Kyklos |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=534–55 |year=2011 |last1=Hottenrott |first1=Hanna |last2=Thorwarth |first2=Susanne }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such increase in commercialization and translation of research could provide social and economic benefits.&lt;ref name=Hottenrott2011/&gt; However, it is difficult to determine whether this increase in apparent impact is due to the industry funding itself or is just a read out that industry funds target work that tends to produce more citations per publication as well as more patents.&lt;ref name=Jahnke/&gt;

The '''Institutional Analysis and Development framework''' ('''IAD''') was developed by [[Elinor Ostrom]], an American [[political scientist]], also known as the first woman to receive the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elinor Ostrom|Ostrom, Elinor]]. (1990) ''Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action''. New York: Cambridge University.&lt;/ref&gt; The IAD relates a set of concepts to help in the analysis of collective action problems that involve social structures, positions, and rules. Under the rational choice models, the IAD was devised in an attempt to ''explain and predict'' outcomes by formalising the structures, positions, and rules involved in collective choice problems. Thus, it can be seen as a [[Systematic sampling|systematic method]] to collect policy analysis functions similar to [[analytical technique|analytic technique]] commonly used in [[Physical science|physical]] and [[social science]]s and understand how institution operate and change over a period of time&lt;ref name=indiana&gt;{{cite web|author1=Michael D. McGinnis|title=An Introduction to IAD and the Language of the Ostrom Workshop: A Simple Guide to a Complex Framework for the Analysis of Institutions and Their Development|url=http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=751119001100098006090092064001065006034048031046008017077070065006068117100125067022058117006035008099001118111016111092122095106078039042042125118092118002001030086033030046005106074116117000084089121084&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;TYPE=1|publisher=[[Indiana University]]|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mason&gt;{{cite book|author1=Margaret M.

=== Components of the framework ===
[[File:IAD framework diagram.png|thumb|400px|IAD framework diagram]]
Ostrom thought of the IAD as a "multi-level conceptual map" with which one could zoom in and out of particular hierarchical parts of the regularised interactions in an established social system. The IAD framework helps to perceive complex collective action problems by dividing them into 'action arenas', that are smaller pieces of practically understandable function.&lt;ref name="indiana" /&gt; The analyst assumes that the structure of the action situation is fixed in the short-term. For an action situation to exist, there must be "actors in positions" (the number of possible roles that are available in this recurring interaction situation)&lt;ref name="Understanding Institutional Diversity"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s8085.pdf|title=Understanding Institutional Diversity|author=Elinor Ostrom|date=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400831739|location=Princeton|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Actors have choices within the existing (rule) structure. In the study of outcomes from collective choice situations, actors are influenced by the institutional arrangements, the socio-economic conditions, and the physical environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Krister Andersson|title=Understanding decentralized forest governance: an application of the institutional analysis and development framework|url=http://sspp.proquest.com/archives/vol2iss1/0507-010.andersson.html|journal=Sustainability: Science, Practice, &amp; Policy|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The institutional arrangements can be studied by seven rule types (as per below).&lt;ref name="Understanding Institutional Diversity" /&gt;

==Education==
Van Ginneken completed a bachelor's degree at the [[Radboud University Nijmegen]], a master’s at the [[University of Amsterdam]], followed by a brief stint at the [[École pratique des Hautes études]] en sciences sociales in Paris, and finally a Ph. D. with distinction on [[mass psychology]] and [[crowd psychology]]. He taught at various universities, ultimately as a long-time associate professor at the International School and Communication Science Department of the [[University of Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Kumar, ''The writers dictionary'', Farmington Hills, Michigan: St. James Press 2011 (26th ed.). {{ISBN|1-55862-756-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Journalism==
For most of the 1970s, he worked as a Paris-based newspaper correspondent and roving reporter on third world affairs for Dutch media, with isolated contributions to foreign newspapers such as the French ''[[Le Monde]]'' and the British ''[[The Guardian]]''. In line with the spirit of [[May 1968 in France]] and widespread opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam war, he adhered to the [[unequal exchange]] and [[dependency theory]], and came to sympathize with [[liberation movements]] and [[third world]] revolutions. Two of his early  books then focused on the new conflicts arising from them. ''The rise and fall of Lin Piao'' (and the so-called ‘Gang of Four’) dealt with ultraleftism during the Chinese cultural revolution. ''The third Indochina war'' dealt with the subsequent confrontation between China, Vietnam and Cambodia.
In the course of the early 1980s, however, Van Ginneken recognized that he had become too much of a [[fellow traveler]], and returned to academic work in his original fields.

==Academic Work==
This covered three themes: first the history of science, second social, political and mass psychology, third media images of other cultures. On the first theme, he published a series of studies on the history of [[political psychology]],&lt;ref&gt;‘Outline of a cultural history’. Ch. 1, pp. 3-22, in W. Stone &amp; P. Schaffner (1988), ''The psychology of politics'', New York: Springer. French transl.: [http://documents.irevues.inist.fr/handle/2042/15128 "Hermès: documents irevues"]{{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[crowd psychology]],&lt;ref&gt;''Crowds, psychology and politics''. Reviews:

Ch. 7, pp. 220-244, in J. Jansz &amp; P. van Drunen (eds., 2004), ''A social history of psychology'', Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; He just completed a biography of Kurt Baschwitz: a Jewish- German- Dutch pioneer of communication studies and social psychology. The second theme concerned new approaches to [[mass psychology]] and [[collective behavior]] sociology, in line with [[complex adaptive systems]] and [[chaos theory]] ''in Collective behavior and public opinion – Rapid shifts'',&lt;ref&gt;''Collective behavior and public opinion''. (Dutch: ''Brein-bevingen''). Review: [http://readon.sg/det_11264691.aspx "Read On"].&lt;/ref&gt; with a further Dutch title on [[self-organization]] and [[swarming]].&lt;ref&gt;''De kracht van de zwerm – Zelfsturing in de organisatie'', Amsterdam: ''Amstel/ Business Contact'', 2009 (illustrated).

The third theme concerned a series of studies on [[media psychology]], and [[stereotypes]] about [[cultural identity]]. In the international [[news media]]: with ''Understanding global news''.&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding global news''. (Dutch: ''De schepping van de wereld in het nieuws''). Review: [http://ecs.sagepub.com/content/2/3/423.extract "Sage Journals"].&lt;/ref&gt; In movies: with ''Screening difference – How Hollywood blockbusters imagine race, ethnicity and culture''.&lt;ref&gt;''Screening difference''. (Dutch: ''Exotisch Hollywood''). Review: [http://news-business.vlex.com/vid/screening-blockbuster-imagine-ethnicity-68316937 "Vlex"].&lt;/ref&gt; As well as on the clash of civilizations,&lt;ref&gt;‘9/11 as a trigger for long-term shifts in world public opinion’, ''International Communication Gazette'', Vol. 4, No. 4 (Aug. 2007), pp. 323-333.  [http://gaz.sagepub.com/content/69/4/323.abstract abstract: ''International Communication Gazette''].&lt;/ref&gt; with further Dutch titles on classical comic strips, interpersonal communication and the immigration debate.

Next to his academic work, Van Ginneken always remained involved in a wide range of non-academic projects, for instance in [[science communication]]: for national events, major museums and prime-time television. Today, he is an independent speaker and writer, based near Nice in France.

'''Language proficiency''' or '''linguistic proficiency''' is the ability of an individual to speak or perform in a [[language]]. As theories among pedagogues as to what constitutes proficiency go,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/pubs/eacwest/elptests.htm#Definitions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050408094300/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/pubs/eacwest/elptests.htm#Definitions |date=April 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there is little consistency as to how different organizations classify it. Additionally, [[fluency]] and [[language]] [[Linguistic competence|competence]] are generally recognized as being related, but separate controversial subjects. In predominant frameworks in the [[United States]], proficient speakers demonstrate both accuracy and fluency, and use a variety of discourse strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lauder.wharton.upenn.edu/pdf/OPI_Guidelines.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060429203232/http://lauder.wharton.upenn.edu/pdf/OPI_Guidelines.pdf |date=April 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, native speakers of a language can be [[wikt:fluent|fluent]] without being considered proficient. Native-level fluency is estimated to be between 20,000 and 40,000 words, but basic conversational fluency might require only as little as 3,000 words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://novelconcept.org/how-many-words-to-fluency ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109160341/http://novelconcept.org/how-many-words-to-fluency |date=January 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
===ACTFL===
The [[American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages]] (ACTFL) distinguishes between proficiency and performance. In part, ACTFL's definition of proficiency is derived from mandates issued by the U.S. government, declaring that a [[limited English proficiency|limited English proficient]] student is one who comes from a non-English background and "who has sufficient difficulty speaking, reading, writing, or understanding the English language and whose difficulties may deny such an individual the opportunity to learn successfully in classrooms where the language of instruction is English or to participate fully in our society".

ACTFL views "performance" as being the combined effect of all three modes of communication: interpretive, interpersonal, and presentational.

==Proficiency frameworks==
Note that test scores may not correlate reliably, as different understandings of proficiency lead to different types of assessment:
*FSI Test ([[Foreign Service Institute]]) Scores range from 0 to 5.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utm.edu/staff/globeg/ilrhome.shtml |title=ILR Scale |publisher=Utm.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(deprecated)''
*[[ILR scale|Interagency Language Roundtable]]  Scores range from 0 to 5.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; ''(evolved from FSI)''
*[[Language Proficiency Index]]
*[[ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines]] ACTFL recognises ten different levels of proficiency: "novice", "intermediate", "advanced", and "superior", of which the first three are each subdivided into "low", "mid", and "high".
*[[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] CEFR recognises six levels: A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 and C2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7022">'''Macrosociology''' is an approach to [[sociology]] which emphasizes the analysis of [[social system]]s and [[population]]s on a large scale, at the level of [[social structure]], and often at a necessarily high level of theoretical abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Calhoun(ed) ''Dictionary of the Social Sciences'' (Article: Macrosociology), Oxford University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsociology]], by contrast, focuses on the individual social [[agency (sociology)|agency]]. Macrosociology also concerns individuals, families, and other constituent aspects of a society, but always does so in relation to larger social system of which they are a part. Macrosociology can also be the analysis of large collectivities (e.g. the [[city]], the [[christian Church|church]]).&lt;ref&gt;John Scott &amp; Gordon Marshall (eds) ''Dictionary of Sociology'', Oxford University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Human [[population]]s are considered a society to the degree that is politically autonomous and its members to engage in a broad range of cooperative activities.{{Clarify|date=December 2013}}&lt;ref name="lenski1982"&gt;[[Gerhard Lenski]], ''Human societies: An introduction to Macrosociology'', McGraw-Hill, 1982, {{ISBN|0-07-037176-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, this definition would apply to the population of [[Germany]] being deemed a society, but [[German language|German]]-speaking people as a whole scattered about different countries would not be considered a society.&lt;ref name="lenski1982" /&gt; Macrosociology deals with broad societal trends that can later be applied to the smaller features of a society. To differentiate, macrosociology deals with issues such as [[war]], distress of [[Third World]] nations, [[poverty]], and environmental deprivation, whereas microsociology analyses issues such as the role of [[women]], the nature of the [[family]], and [[immigration]].&lt;ref name="lenski1982" /&gt;

==Theoretical strategies==

There are a number of theoretical strategies within contemporary macrosociology, but four of them stand out as major ones:

* The Idealist Strategy attempts to explain the basic features of social life by reference to the creative capacity of the human mind. "Idealists believe that human uniqueness lies in the fact that humans attach symbolic meanings to their actions"&lt;ref name="sanderson1988"&gt;Sanderson, Stephen K. ''Macrosociology: An Introduction to Human Societies'', Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Materialist Strategy attempts to explain the basic features of human social life in terms of the practical, material conditions of their existence.  These conditions include things like the nature of the physical environment, the level of technology, and the organization of the economic system.&lt;ref name="lenski1982" /&gt;
* Functionalism, or [[structural functionalism]], is defined by many principles.  Functionalism essentially states that societies are complex systems of interrelated and interdependent parts, and each part of a society significantly influences the others.  Also, each part of society exists because it has a specific function to perform in contributing to the society as a whole. Finally, it states that societies tend toward a state of equilibrium or homeostasis, and if there is a disturbance in any part of the society then the other parts will adjust to restore the stability of the society as a whole.&lt;ref name="lenski1982" /&gt;
* The [[Conflict Theory]], also called the Conflict Theoretical Strategy, rejects the idea that societies tend toward some basic consensus of harmony in which the features of society work for everyone's good.  It is based on the idea that the basic structure of society is determined by individuals and groups acquiring scarce resources to satisfy their own needs and wants, thus creating endless conflicts.&lt;ref name="lenski1982" /&gt;

== Historical macrosociology ==

As [[globalization]] has affected the world, it has also affected historical macrosociology, leading to the development of two different branches. One is based mainly in comparative and historical sociology (CHS), and the other in political economy of the world-systems (PEWS). CHS bases its analysis on states, and searches for "generalizations about common properties and principles of variation among instances across time and space."&lt;ref&gt;Arrighi, Giovanni. Globalization and historical macrosociology. (2000).''Sociology for the twenty-first century.'' 117-133.&lt;/ref&gt; PEWS, on the other hand, uses systems of states for analysis, and searches for "generalizations about interdependencies among a system's components and of principles of variation among systemic conditions across time and space."&lt;ref name="lenski1982" /&gt; Despite the two schools' differences, both use historical knowledge to try and solve some of the problems seen in the field of macrosociology. As of recently, it has been argued that globalization poses a threat to the CHS way of thinking because it often leads to the dissolution of distinct states.&lt;ref name="lenski1982" /&gt;

Historical Macrosociologists:&lt;ref name="lenski1982" /&gt;

[[Charles Tilly]]- CHS scholar- analysis based on national states

[[Immanuel Wallerstein]]- developed world systems theory- analysis based on world capitalist system

== The future of macrosociology: micro-macro links ==
Perhaps the most highly developed integrative effort to link microsociological and macrosociological phenomena is found in [[Anthony Giddens]]'s [[theory of structuration]], in which "social structure is defined as both constraining and enabling of human activity as well as both internal and external to the actor."&lt;ref name="borgatta1992"&gt;Borgatta, Edgar F. ''Encyclopedia of Sociology: Volume 3'', Simon &amp; Schuster Macmillan, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  Attempts to link micro and macro phenomena are evident in a growing body of empirical research.  Such work appears to follow Giddens' view of the constraining and enabling nature of social structure for human activity and the need to link structure and action.  "It appears safe to say that while macrosociology will always remain a central component of sociological theory and research, increasing effort will be devoted to creating workable models that link it with its microcounterpart."&lt;ref name="borgatta1992" /&gt;

The '''Manchester Institute of Biotechnology''', formerly the '''Manchester Interdisciplinary Biocentre''' ('''MIB''') is a [[research institute]] of the [[University of Manchester]], England.  The centre has been designed to enable academic communities to explore specific areas of interdisciplinary quantitative [[biology|bioscience]], largely through the efforts of multidisciplinary research teams. Research at MIB follows three broadly defined, interdisciplinary and complementary themes: Biological Mechanism and Catalysis, Molecular Bioengineering, [[Systems biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Planning for the institute began late in 1998 and culminated with the official opening on 25 October 2006 of the [[John Garside]] Building. The building won "Building of the Year" from Manchester Chamber's Building and Development Committee in 2006 along with [[Beetham Tower, Manchester]].

The building has featured in several television commercials, notably Injury Lawyers 4u.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tellyads.com/show_movie.php?filename=ta1784 "Injury Lawyers 4 U - We Fight Hard"], Tellyads, accessed November 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute was  renamed the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology on 1 June 2012, retaining the acronym MIB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mib.ac.uk/aboutus/structure/index2.html|title=Message from the Director|first=Nigel|last=Scrutton|accessdate=19 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421051812/http://www.mib.ac.uk/aboutus/structure/index2.html|archivedate=21 April 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marine Transfer Operations''' are conducted at many ports around the world between '''tanker ships, barges, and marine terminals'''. Specifically, once the marine vessel is secure at the dock a [[loading arm]] or transfer hose is connected between a valve header on the dock and the manifold header on the vessel. A marine transfer of petroleum products cannot be conducted unless it is supervised by a '''person-in-charge (PIC)''' on the vessel who is seafarer in the [[Merchant Marine]] and another person-in-charge on the dock.
[[Image:Tanker unloading crude oil.jpg|thumb|300px|Tanker ship arriving at a Marine Terminal.]]

== Person-in-charge ==
The person-in-charge on the dock is called a [[Loading master]]-PIC and the person-in charge on the barge will be the '''Tankerman-PIC.''' The person-in-charge on a tanker ship will be the '''[[deck officer]]''' who monitors the transfer of product in the '''cargo control room'''. All persons-in-charge must have special training in order to obtain the proper credentials such as licensing and endorsement on their merchant mariner documents.
[[Image:TugBargesCCC17Ap06.jpg|thumb|300px|Inland Tug and Barge]]

== Marine surveyor ==

Loading Masters work closely with the marine surveyor in agreeing to the sequence of the transfer. Such as whether any product sampling will take place prior to commencement, determining if a line displacement will occur, agreeing on whether the final stop at completion will either be a shore stop or a draft stop on the vessel. The marine surveyor gauges the vessel's tanks and shore tanks to ensure the correct amount of product is transferred. Additionally, the surveyor or inspector will obtain product samples on the marine vessel and shore tank for laboratory analysis to ensure that the product meets all specifications of purity.

== Regulations ==
Transfer operations and commencement of a transfer is highly regulated throughout the world with consideration of the environment with potential of [[water pollution]] occurring if petroleum product is released into the water during the transfer. Federal, state, and local laws must be observed during marine transfer operations. 

[[Maritime Security (USCG)]], [[occupational safety and health]] regulations must be adhered to in addition to environmental regulations during marine transfer operations. These regulation's are enforced by local state port control organizations such as the United States Coast Guard in the United States.

==Marine transfer operators==

A marine transfer operation occurs between three main stakeholders which includes the Loading Master-PIC, Vessel Person-In -Charge PIC, and marine surveyor or inspector. These individuals communicate prior to the transfer agreeing on the sequence of events that will occur before, during, and after the transfer. During the course of the transfer the Loading Master is in continuous two way radio contact with the vessel Person-In-Charge and standing by to stop the transfer immediately if any problems develop such as leaks at the transfer hose or loading arm.

[[File:Great-plate-count-anomaly.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The great plate count anomaly. Counts of cells obtained via cultivation are orders of magnitude lower than those directly observed under the microscope. This is because microbiologists are able to cultivate only a minority of naturally occurring microbes using current laboratory techniques, depending on the environment.&lt;ref name="hugenholz2002" /&gt;]]
'''Microbial ecology''' (or '''environmental microbiology''') is the [[ecology]] of [[microorganism]]s: their relationship with one another and with their environment. It concerns the three major [[domain (biology)|domains]] of life—[[Eukaryote|Eukaryota]], [[Archaea]], and [[Bacteria]]—as well as [[virus]]es.&lt;ref name="BartonNorthup2011" /&gt;

Microorganisms, by their omnipresence, impact the entire [[biosphere]]. Microbial life plays a primary role in regulating [[biogeochemistry|biogeochemical]] systems in virtually all of our planet's environments, including some of the most [[extremophiles|extreme]], from [[Antarctica|frozen environments]] and acidic lakes, to [[hydrothermal vents]] at the bottom of deepest oceans, and some of the most familiar, such as the human [[small intestine]].&lt;ref name="bowler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="konopka"/&gt;  As a consequence of the quantitative magnitude of microbial life (Whitman and coworkers calculated {{val|5.0|e=30}} cells, eight orders of magnitude greater than the number of stars in the observable universe&lt;ref name="whitman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wolfram"/&gt;) microbes, by virtue of their [[biomass]] alone, constitute a significant [[carbon sink]].&lt;ref name="ReddyDeLaune2004"/&gt; Aside from carbon fixation, microorganisms' key collective metabolic processes (including [[nitrogen fixation]], [[Methanogenesis|methane metabolism]], and [[sulfur metabolism]]) control global biogeochemical cycling.&lt;ref name="delong"/&gt; The immensity of microorganisms' production is such that, even in the total absence of eukaryotic life, these processes would likely continue unchanged.&lt;ref name="Lupp"/&gt;

== History ==
While microbes have been studied since the seventeenth-century, this research was from a primarily physiological perspective rather than an ecological one.&lt;ref name="konopka2009"/&gt; For instance, [[Louis Pasteur]] and his disciples were interested in the problem of microbial distribution both on land and in the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adler|first=Antony|last2=Dücker|first2=Erik|date=2017-04-05|title=When Pasteurian Science Went to Sea: The Birth of Marine Microbiology|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10739-017-9477-8|journal=Journal of the History of Biology|language=en|pages=1–27|doi=10.1007/s10739-017-9477-8|issn=0022-5010|volume=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martinus Beijerinck]] invented the [[enrichment culture]], a fundamental method of studying [[microbe]]s from the environment.  He is often incorrectly credited with framing the [[microbial biogeography|microbial biogeographic]] idea that "everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects", which was stated by [[Lourens Baas Becking]].&lt;ref name="deWit2006"/&gt; [[Sergei Winogradsky]] was one of the first researchers to attempt to understand [[microorganisms]] outside of the medical context—making him among the first students of microbial ecology and environmental microbiology—discovering [[chemosynthesis]], and developing the [[Winogradsky column]] in the process.&lt;ref name="brock"/&gt;{{rp|644}}

Beijerinck and Windogradsky, however, were focused on the physiology of microorganisms, not the microbial [[habitat]] or their ecological interactions.&lt;ref name="konopka2009"/&gt; Modern microbial ecology was launched by [[Robert Hungate]] and coworkers, who investigated the [[rumen]] ecosystem. The study of the rumen required Hungate to develop techniques for culturing anaerobic microbes, and he also pioneered a quantitative approach to the study of microbes and their ecological activities that differentiated the relative contributions of species and [[catabolic pathway]]s.&lt;ref name="konopka2009"/&gt;

==Roles==
Microorganisms are the backbone of all [[ecosystem]]s, but even more so in the zones where photosynthesis is unable to take place because of the absence of light. In such zones, [[chemosynthetic]] microbes provide energy and [[carbon]] to the other organisms.

Other microbes are [[decomposer]]s, with the ability to recycle [[nutrient]]s from other organisms' waste products.  These microbes play a vital role in biogeochemical cycles.&lt;ref name="FenchelBlackburn2012" /&gt; The [[nitrogen cycle]], the [[phosphorus cycle]], the [[sulphur cycle]] and the [[carbon cycle]] all depend on microorganisms in one way or another. For example, the [[nitrogen gas]] which makes up 78% of the earth's atmosphere is unavailable to most organisms, until it is converted to a biologically available form by the microbial process of [[nitrogen fixation]].

Due to the high level of [[horizontal gene transfer]] among microbial communities,&lt;ref name="mcdaniel"/&gt; microbial ecology is also of importance to studies of [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="smets"/&gt;

== Symbiosis ==
Microbes, especially bacteria, often engage in [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationships (either [[Mutualism (biology)|positive]] or [[Parasitism|negative]]) with other microorganisms or larger organisms. Although physically small, symbiotic relationships amongst microbes are significant in [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] processes and their evolution.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/777261246 |title=Processes in microbial ecology |last=L. |first=Kirchman, David |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199586936 |location=Oxford |oclc=777261246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=López-García |first=Purificación |last2=Eme |first2=Laura |last3=Moreira |first3=David |date=2017-12-07 |title=Symbiosis in eukaryotic evolution |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519317300954 |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |series=The origin of mitosing cells: 50th anniversary of a classic paper by Lynn Sagan (Margulis) |volume=434 |issue=Supplement C |pages=20–33 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.02.031}}&lt;/ref&gt; The types of symbiotic relationship that microbes participate in include [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], [[commensalism]], [[parasitism]],&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/317664342 |title=The microbial challenge : science, disease, and public health |last=I. |first=Krasner, Robert |date=2010 |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |isbn=978-0763756895 |edition=2nd |location=Sudbury, Mass. |oclc=317664342}}&lt;/ref&gt; and amensalism,&lt;ref name="Microbial interactions2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Faust |first1=Karoline |last2=Raes |first2=Jeroen |date=16 July 2012 |title=Microbial interactions: from networks to models |journal=Nature Reviews. Microbiology |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=538–550 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro2832 |pmid=22796884}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these relationships affect the ecosystem in many ways.

=== Mutualism ===
Mutualism in microbial ecology is a relationship between microbial species and between microbial species and humans that allow for both sides to benefit.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53231924 |title=Understanding bacteria |last=Sheela. |first=Srivastava, |date=2003 |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |others=Srivastava, P. S. (Prem S.) |isbn=1402016336 |location=Dordrecht |oclc=53231924}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One such example would be [[syntrophy]], also known as cross-feeding,&lt;ref name="Microbial interactions2"/&gt; which is clearly shown in Methanobacterium omelianskii. Although initially thought of as one microbial species, this system is actually two species - an S organism and Methabacterium bryantii. The S organism provides the bacterium with the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which the bacterium needs in order to grow and produce methane.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=López-García |first=Purificación |last2=Eme |first2=Laura |last3=Moreira |first3=David |date=December 2017 |title=Symbiosis in eukaryotic evolution |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519317300954 |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |series=The origin of mitosing cells: 50th anniversary of a classic paper by Lynn Sagan (Margulis) |volume=434 |issue=Supplement C |pages=20–33 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.02.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reaction used by the S organism for the production of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Endergonic reaction|endergonic]] (and so thermodynamically unfavored) however, when coupled to the reaction used by Methabacterium bryantii in its production of methane, the overall reaction becomes [[Exergonic process|exergonic]].&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; &amp;nbsp;Thus the two organisms are in a mutualistic relationship which allows them to grow and thrive in an environment, deadly for either species alone. [[Lichen]] is an example of a symbiotic organism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Amensalism ===
Amensalism (also commonly known as antagonism) is a type of symbiotic relationship where one species/organism is harmed while the other remains unaffected.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; One example of such a relationship that takes place in microbial ecology is between the microbial species [[Lactobacillus casei]] and [[Pseudomonas taetrolens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=García |first=Cristina |last2=Rendueles |first2=Manuel |last3=Díaz |first3=Mario |date=September 2017 |title=Synbiotic Fermentation for the Co-Production of Lactic and Lactobionic Acids from Residual Dairy Whey |journal=Biotechnology Progress |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=1250–1256 |doi=10.1002/btpr.2507 |pmid=28556559}}&lt;/ref&gt; When co-existing in an environment, ''Pseudomonas taetrolens'' shows inhibited growth and decreased production of lactobionic acid (its main product) most likely due to the byproducts created by Lactobacillus casei during its production of lactic acid.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/317664342 |title=The microbial challenge : science, disease, and public heatlh |last=I. |first=Krasner, Robert |date=2010 |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |isbn=9780763756895 |edition=2nd |location=Sudbury, Mass. |oclc=317664342}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lactobacillus casei shows no difference in its behaviour, and such this relationship can be defined as amensalism.

== Microbial resource management ==
[[Biotechnology]] may be used alongside microbial ecology to address a number of environmental and [[economic]] challenges. For example, molecular techniques such as [[Community Fingerprinting|community fingerprinting]] can be used to track changes in microbial communities over time or assess their [[biodiversity]]. Managing the carbon cycle to sequester [[carbon dioxide]] and prevent excess [[methanogenesis]] is important in mitigating [[global warming]], and the prospects of [[bioenergy]] are being expanded by the development of [[microbial fuel cell]]s. Microbial resource management advocates a more progressive attitude towards [[disease]], whereby [[biological control agent]]s are favoured over attempts at eradication. Fluxes in [[microbial communities]] has to be better characterized for this field's potential to be realised.&lt;ref name="verstraete"/&gt; In addition, there are also clinical implications, as marine microbial symbioses are a valuable source of existing and novel antimicrobial agents, and thus offer another line of inquiry in the evolutionary arms race of [[antibiotic resistance]], a pressing concern for researchers.&lt;ref name="Ott"/&gt;

== In built environment and human interaction ==
{{Main|Human microbiota}}
Microbes exist in all areas, including homes, offices, commercial centers, and hospitals. In 2016, the journal ''Microbiome'' published a collection of various works studying the microbial ecology of the [[built environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/builtenvironment|title=Microbiology of the Built Environment|website=www.biomedcentral.com|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 study of pathogenic bacteria in hospitals found that their ability to survive varied by the type, with some surviving for only a few days while others survived for months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kramer |first=Axel |last2=Schwebke |first2=Ingeborg |last3=Kampf |first3=Günter |date=2006-08-16 |title=How long do nosocomial pathogens persist on inanimate surfaces? A systematic review |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-6-130 |journal=BMC Infectious Diseases |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |doi=10.1186/1471-2334-6-130 |pmc=1564025 |pmid=16914034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lifespan of microbes in the home varies similarly. Generally bacteria and viruses require a wet environment with a humidity of over 10 percent.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2002-08/how-long-do-microbes-bacteria-and-viruses-live-surfaces-home-normal-room-tem|title=How long do microbes like bacteria and viruses live on surfaces in the home at normal room temperatures?|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[E. Coli|E. coli]]'' can survive for a few hours to a day.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bacteria which form spores can survive longer, with ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' surviving potentially for weeks or, in the case of ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'', years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the home, pets can be carriers of bacteria; for example, reptiles are commonly carriers of salmonella.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.veterinarypracticenews.com/November-2012/Raw-Diets-Linked-To-Salmonella/|title=Raw Diets Linked To Salmonella|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''S. aureus'' is particularly common, and asymptomatically colonizes about 30% of the human population;&lt;ref name="Tong2015"&gt;{{cite journal|date=July 2015|title=Staphylococcus aureus infections: epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management|journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews|volume=28|issue=3|pages=603–661 |doi=10.1128/CMR.00134-14 |pmc=4451395|pmid=26016486|author1=Tong SY|author2=Davis JS|author3=Eichenberger E |author4=Holland TL |author5=Fowler VG}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to decolonize carriers have met with limited success&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healio.com/pediatrics/emerging-diseases/news/print/infectious-diseases-in-children/%257B10db19d3-8aa4-4323-99ce-258fd81b609f%257D/many-factors-involved-in-decolonization-of-s-aureus|title=Many factors involved in decolonization of S. aureus |website=www.healio.com |access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generally involve [[mupirocin]] nasally and [[chlorhexidine]] washing, potentially along with vancomycin and cotrimoxazole to address intestinal and urinary tract infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Buehlmann|first=M. |last2=Frei|first2=R. |last3=Fenner |first3=L. |last4=Dangel |first4=M. |last5=Fluckiger |first5=U. |last6=Widmer |first6=A.

=== Antimicrobials ===
Some metals, particularly copper and silver, have antimicrobial properties. Using [[antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces]] is a technique which has begun to be used in the 21st century to prevent transmission of bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/the-bacteria-fighting-super-element-making-a-return-to-hospitals-copper/2015/09/20/19251704-5beb-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html|title=The bacteria-fighting super element making a return to hospitals: Copper|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silver nanoparticle]]s have also begun to be incorporated into building surfaces and fabrics, although concerns have been raised about the potential side-effects of the tiny particles on human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-02-16/health/ct-nanosilver-met-20140216_1_consumer-products-other-antibiotic-drugs-germs |title=Silver nanoparticles kill germs, raise health concerns |access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Postilion.png|thumb|300px|right|This English etching from 1793 shows a postillion mounted on the front left horse]]
"'''My [[postillion]] has been struck by lightning'''", "'''Our postillion has been struck by lightning'''", and other variations on the same pattern, are often given as examples of the ridiculous phrases supposed to have been found in [[phrase book]]s or language instruction in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  The word ''postillion'' may occur in its alternative spelling ''[[postilion]]''.

Although various forms of the sentence are widely cited, the exact wording and the context in which it is said to have originally been used vary.  For example, a teaching manual attributes it to a Portuguese-English phrasebook:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
|title=Teaching English as a Foreign Language
|first=Geoffrey
|last=Broughton |author2=Christopher Brumfit |author3=Roger Flavell |author4=Roger D. Wilde |author5=Anita Pincas

|isbn=0-415-05882-1
|page=41
|edition=2nd
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DIancY-fnR0C
}}; emphasis added
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The phrase-book for Portuguese learners of English which included the often-quoted and bizarre sentence  'Pardon me, but '''your postillion has been struck by lightning'''' demonstrates a total lack of sense of context: who can have said this, to whom and in what circumstances?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
By contrast a linguistics textbook mentions the supposedly "apocryphal" phrase during a description of foreign language teaching in "the schoolrooms of Europe at the close of the nineteenth century":&lt;ref&gt;

|pages=31–32
}}; emphasis added
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[S]entences—especially constructed to contain only the grammar and vocabulary which had already been covered—were laboriously translated, in writing, into and out of the student's first language. Such sentences, often bizarrely remote from any conceivable use, have been the occasion for jokes ever since.  We have probably all heard references to the apocryphal "'''My postilion has been struck by lightning'''" and the infamous ''[[La plume de ma tante (linguistics)|plume de ma tante]]''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origin==
During the nineteenth century, publishers began producing multilingual phrase-books for businessmen and wealthy travellers. An early example is Georg Wolfrum's ''Handbuch für Jünglinge'' (1825), which gives English, German, French and Italian versions of "Are the postilions insolent?" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Handbuch für Jünglinge

|url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/ucm.5319405203?urlappend=%3Bseq=298
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same question is found in [[Baedeker]]'s ''Conversationsbuch für Reisende''.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. {{cite book
|title=Conversationsbuch für Reisende: In vier sprachen, Deutsch, Französisch, Englisch, Italienisch

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]]'s ''Handbook of Travel-Talk'' (1847) includes a section entitled "Accidents on a Journey".  It gives English, French, German and Italian translation suggestions for a variety of mishaps which might befall a traveller, such as one's postillion becoming injured, or finding oneself in stormy weather:&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote |
Oh, dear! The postilion has been thrown (off) down.&lt;br&gt;
Is he hurt?  Run for assistance to the next cottage.&lt;br&gt;
Ask for a surgeon.&lt;br&gt;
I am afraid he has broken his leg {{--}} his arm.&lt;br&gt;
He has been bruised on his head.&lt;br&gt;
He must be carried home gently.&lt;br&gt;
It rains in torrents.&lt;br&gt;
It lightens{{--}}it thunders.
}}

A theatre review in the September 14, 1889 issue of the London illustrated weekly ''The Graphic'' includes a phrase very similar to the one under discussion, attributing it to Murray's travel guide:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=The Graphic |date=1889-09-14 |title=Theatres |page=335 |location=London |volume=xl |issue=1033 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Graphic_1889-09-14_335.png}}; emphasis added.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;The proprietor of the {{sc|Greenwich}} Theatre has hit on the notion of ornamenting his playbills with a picture of the house, on which every exit is marked in conspicuous fashion.  Somebody has objected that in the face of fire or panic no one would be likely to consult this guide to the methods of escape.  This reminds one of the criticism of a gentleman on Mr. Murray's "Travel Talk," when he found the exclamation, "'''Dear me, our postillion has been struck dead by lightning!'''" set forth for his convenience in four languages.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The August 30, 1916 issue of the [[United Kingdom|British]] magazine [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']] includes this item:&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.32106019661831?urlappend=%3Bseq=170 ''Punch'', August 30, 1916; v. 151, p.162, col. 3]; emphasis added&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; An officer serving in the Balkans writes to say that he has just come across a Hungarian-English phrase-book which starts with the useful phrase, "'''My postilion has been struck by lightning'''."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another usage of the phrase occurs in a 1932 book entitled ''Little Missions'', written by "Septimus Despencer":&lt;ref&gt;Despencer (1932), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It was my fortune once to be marooned for twenty-four hours in a siding of a railway station in what is now [[Yugoslavia|Jugoslavia]] but was then South Hungary.   I wandered into the village, and in the village shop which sold everything I found a dozen of old second-hand books.  One of them was a Magyar-English Manual of Conversation containing useful phrases such as every traveller needs to know. The first section was headed  'On the road', and the first sentence in it (which I instantly mastered) was: ''''Dear me, our postilion has been struck by lightning'''.'  This is the sort of thing that only happens in Hungary; and, when it happens, this is the sort of remark that only Hungarians make.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to its introduction, the travels reported in the book occurred during "[t]he three years following the armistice of 1918":&lt;ref&gt;
Despencer (1932), [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/paultabaka/0/etc/despencer/septimus.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+00:19:34 p. 5]; emphasis added.
&lt;/ref&gt; thus Despencer's discovery of the phrase would be dated during the period 1919-1921.  In the April 2008 issue of the ''Quote ... Unquote'' newsletter, Nigel Rees speculates that the phrase "passed into general circulation" from Despencer's book.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable sightings==
In [[James Thurber]]'s 1937 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article "There's No Place Like Home", a phrasebook from "the era of Imperial Russia" contains the "magnificent" line: "Oh, dear, our postillion has been struck by lightning!".  Thurber speculates that such a "fantastic piece of disaster" must have been rare, "even in the days of the Czars".&lt;ref name="thurber"&gt;
reprinted in {{cite book

|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Guem4QpR0BwC
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Thurber heard of the quote from "an writer in a London magazine".&lt;ref name="thurber"/&gt;

In [[James Michener]]'s 1954 novel [[Sayonara]], the heroine Hana-Ogi tries to learn a little English from a phrasebook to communicate with her American lover and based on its recommendation starts with this phrase, much to his bewilderment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

"The Postilion Has Been Struck By Lightning" is the title of a two-stanza poem by [[Patricia Beer]], published in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

|first=Patricia
|last=Beer
|location=London

&lt;/ref&gt;  The poem was later selected for inclusion in ''The Oxford Book of Contemporary Verse''.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  In it, the author laments the death in a thunderstorm of "the best postilion I ever had".

In 1977 actor [[Dirk Bogarde]] titled the first volume of his autobiography ''A Postillion Struck By Lightning''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
|title=A Postillion Struck by Lightning
|first=Dirk
|last= Bogarde
|isbn=0-7011-2207-2

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Bogarde, he heard of the sentence while on a childhood holiday in France.  It came from an old French phrase-book belonging to the nanny of another family.&lt;ref&gt;Bogarde, op. cit., pp. 102, 110&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1995 paper, linguist [[David Crystal]] defined "postilion sentences" as "sentences introduced in teaching [that] seem to have little or no chance of ever being used in real life".&lt;ref&gt;Crystal (1995), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  They are named after the phrase "The postilion has been struck by lightning", which Crystal describes as a famous example of such a sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal (1995), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  He goes on to suggest that "an unexpectedly large number of sentences, used routinely with children with language impairment, are of this type",&lt;ref&gt;Crystal (1995), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and gives as examples "That table's got four legs", and "Clap (your) hands!".&lt;ref&gt;Crystal (1995), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  He concludes that, "if teaching and therapeutic time is to be truly efficacious", postilion sentences should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal (1995), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parasocial interaction''' ('''PSI''') is a term coined by Horton and Wohl in 1956 to refer to a kind of psychological relationship experienced by an audience in their mediated encounters with performers in the mass media, particularly on television. Viewers or listeners come to feel and consider media personalities almost as friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100305809|title=Parasocial interaction - Oxford Reference|language=en|doi=10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100305809|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; PSI is described as an [[illusion]]ary [[experience]], such that media audiences interact with [[persona]]s (e.g., talk show host, [[celebrities]], characters, [[Influencer marketing|social media influencers]]) as if they are engaged in a reciprocal relationship with them. 

==Evolution of the term==
Parasocial interaction was first described from the perspective of media and [[communication studies]]. In 1956, Horton and [[Richard Wohl|Wohl]]  explored the different interactions between [[mass media]] users and media figures and determined the existence of a parasocial relationship, where the user acts as though they are involved in a typical [[social relationship]].&lt;ref name="HW"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Mass communication and para-social interaction: Observation on intimacy at a distance. | journal=Psychiatry | year=1956 | volume=19 | issue=3 | pages=215–229 | last=Horton | first=D. | last2=Wohl | first2=R. | doi=10.1080/00332747.1956.11023049}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, parasocial interaction has existed before mass media, when citizen would establish a bond with political figures, gods or even spirits. Since then, the term has been adopted by psychologists, in furthering their studies of the social relationships that emerge between consumers of mass media and the figures they see represented there. Initially, Horton and Wohl viewed parasocial interactions as abnormalities resulting from a lack of time spent with others.&lt;ref name="HW" /&gt; Perse and Rubin (1989) contested this view, finding that parasocial interactions occurred as a natural byproduct of time spent with media figures.&lt;ref name=PR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perse|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Rubin|first2=Rebecca|title=Attribution in social and parasocial relationships|journal=Communication Research|date=1989|volume=16|issue=1|pages=59–77|doi=10.1177/009365089016001003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although originating from a psychological topic, extensive research of PSI has been performed in the area of [[mass communication]] with manifold results.&lt;ref name="MBB"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=The television audience: a revised perspective | encyclopedia=Sociology of Mass Communication | publisher=Longman | editor=McQuail, D. | year=1972 | location=London | last=McQuail | first=D. | last2=Blumler | first2=J. | last3=Brown | first3=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PWR"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Gratification Discrepancies and News Program Choice | journal=Communication Research | year=1981 | month= | volume=8 | issue=4 | pages=451–478 | doi=10.1177/00936502810080040 | last=Palmgreen | first=P. | last2=Wenner | first2=W.

M. | last2=R. B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists began to show their interest in the concept in the 1980s, and researchers began to develop the concept extensively within the field of communication science.&lt;ref name="Giles"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Parasocial interaction: A review of the literature and a model for future research. | author=Giles, D. C. | journal=Media Psychology | year=2002 | volume=4 | issue=3 | pages=279–305 | doi=10.1207/S1532785XMEP0403_04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many important questions about social psychology were raised concerning the nature of these relationships that are problematic for existing theories in those fields. The concept of parasocial interaction and detailed examination of the behavioral phenomena that it seeks to explain have considerable potential for developing psychological theory.

==Parasocial relationships==

The concepts development of PSI and PSR are interpreted and employed in a different ways in various literature. When it is applied in the use-and-gratifications approaches, the two concepts are typically treated interchangeably, with the regard primarily to a special type of "interpersonal involvement" with media figures that includes different phenomena such as interaction and identification (Rubin, Perse, &amp; Powell, 1985). In contrast to the U&amp;G approaches, research in other domains such as media psychology and semiotics, argue for a clear distinction between the two terms (Klimmt, Hartmann, &amp; Schramm, 2006). PSI specifically means the one-sided process of media person perception during media exposure; whereas PSR stands for a cross-situational relationship that a viewer or user holds to a media person, which includes specific cognitive and affective components. Schmid &amp; Klimmt (2011) further argue that PSI and PSR are progressive states such that what begins as a PSI has the potential to become a PSR. In sum, the terms, definitions, and models explicating PSI and PSR differ across scientific backgrounds and traditions.

==As a subset of social interaction==
Studying social interaction, and by extension parasocial interaction (PSI), follows a social cognitive approach to defining individual cognitive activity. Accordingly, there are similar psychological processes at work in both parasocial relationships and face-to-face interactions. However, the parasocial relationship does not follow the process of the typical long-term relationship. The media user remains a stranger to the media figure, whereas this "strangeness" would gradually evaporate in typical social interaction.

=== Scientific research ===

The research of PSI obtain significant interest after the advent of the uses and gratifications approach to mass communication research in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="MBB" /&gt; In a study of early soap opera, McQuail et al. (1972) identified two essential functions of PSI: companionship and personal identity. Rosengren and Windahl (1972) further argued that PSI could be identified in the process of viewers' interacting with media figures, but such interaction did not produce identification. This is an important distinction, because identification has a longer history than PSI. Subsequent research has indicated that PSI is evident when identification is not present (Chory-Assad &amp; Yanen, 2005; de Bruin, Suijkerbujk, &amp; Jansz, 2006). During last several decades, PSI has been documented in the research analyzing the relationship between audience members and television newscasters, TV and radio talk-show hosts, sitcom characters and other TV celebrities or performers (Palmgreen, Wenner, &amp; Rayburn, 1980; Rubin &amp; Perse, 1987, Sood &amp; Rogers, 2000; Park &amp; Lennon, 2004; Spitzberg &amp; Cupach, 2007). Research has also been conducted on how a favorable PSI can be facilitated between celebrities and their followers on social media, specifically through the interactions followers have with the celebrities posts on social media (Kim &amp; Song, 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.chb.2016.03.083|title = Celebrity's self-disclosure on Twitter and parasocial relationships: A mediating role of social presence| journal=Computers in Human Behavior| volume=62| pages=570–577|year = 2016|last1 = Kim|first1 = Jihyun| last2=Song| first2=Hayeon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although different PSI scales have been employed in these studies, PSI was clearly documented with each persona (Hataway, 2008).

Noticing the importance of media in the area of psychological research, Giles (2002) asserted that  there is a need for PSI research to move away from the field of mass communication and into the field of psychology.&lt;ref name=Giles /&gt; Studies in this area is commonly conducted by focusing a key psychological issue for PSI: concerning the similarity between parasocial relations and ordinary social relations (Turner, 1993; Gleich, 1996; McKenna &amp; Bargh, 2000; Giles, 2002; Jin &amp; Park, 2009). For example, Turner (1993) adopted the idea of homophily (i.e., the tendency for friendships to form between people that are alike in some designated respect) to examine the interpersonal and psychological predictors of parasocial interaction with television performers. The author found that one dimension of homophily (i.e., attitude) was the best predictor of parasocial interaction. Hataway (2008) indicated that although there seems to be prevailing to analyze PSI in the domain of social psychology, a solid connection to psychological theory and developmental theory has been missing. Hataway (2008) further suggested that more psychological research is needed in order to develop parasocial theory. Specific issues cited were "how parasocial relationships are derived from parasocial interaction and the way those relationships further influence media usage as well as a social construction of reality, and how parasocial interaction is cognitively produced" (p.&amp;nbsp;18). He saw that the majority of PSI research has been conducted by mass communication scholars as a weakness and called for psychologists to refer to Giles (2002) for directions of studies.

Another important consideration for the study of PSI at a psychological level is that there is a form of PSI existing even in interpersonal social situation. People may use fundamentally the same cognitive processes in both interpersonal and mediated communication (Perse &amp; Rubin, 1989). Giles (2002) also suggested that the element of direct interaction occurred in mediated interaction, such as talking to a presenter or celebrity guest, may continue in social interaction, with a cartoon character or a fictional protagonist in the mind.&lt;ref name=Giles /&gt; This may finally constitute a new way of interpreting social interaction. A further consideration is application of social cognitive approaches in individual levels. It is traditionally accepted that this approach is inadequate by itself for the study of relationships (Duck, 1994). However, a number of growing literature on the role of imagination in social interaction (Taylor, 1999; Gleason, Sebanc, &amp; Hartup, 2000; Eyal &amp; Cohen, 2006) suggests that some imaginative activity (e.g., imaginary friends) may be an influential factor in the outcome of real social interaction. PSI is nowadays regarded as an extension of normal social cognition, specifically in terms of the use of the imagination. Current PSI literature commonly acknowledge that the psychological processes acting at the individual level parallel those used in ordinary social activity and relationship building.

=== Studies with children and adolescents ===

Parasocial interaction is best explored across a lifespan, which explains the growing focus on parasocial interaction in children and adolescents. Studies have found that sex-role stereotyping is common in children's parasocial relationships with media figures, though boys most overwhelmingly chooses male characters, while young girls are less likely to prefer one gender over another. Additionally, sex-role stereotyping is more common in children ages 5–6, but decreases in children age 10-11. Existing literature also intimates that attachments, parasocial or otherwise, established in early childhood, are highly influential on relationships created later in life. Many studies have focused on adolescent girls because they are more likely to form a strong bond with a media figure and be influenced in terms of lifestyle choices.

=== Sports ===

==== Team association ====

[[Social identity theory]] says that people become motivated to behave in ways that boost their self-esteem. Having high [[self-esteem]] creates the perception that a person is intelligent, likable, and a good person. In regards to sports teams, fans create a connection within their team to attach themselves to a particular victory or championship.

====Player====

In 2012, Evan Frederick ([[University of Southern Indiana]]), Choong Hoon Lim, Galen Clavio, and Patrick Walsh ([[Indiana University]]) conducted a study on perceived parasocial relationships of Twitter users and athletes. "Analysis of the data revealed a sense of heightened interpersonal closeness based on the interaction style of the athlete. Followers of the social athlete were driven by [[interpersonal]] constructs" (p.&amp;nbsp;481).

====Branding====

In 2007, Brett Boyle and Peter Magnusson, from [[Saint Louis University]] published a study titled "Social Identity and Brand Equity Formation: A Comparative Study of Collegiate Sports Fans". The authors empirically tested fans of a University men's basketball team. According to the study students, alumni, and the general public were all a part of building brand/team equity through means of heightened social identification factors.

==Positive consequences in childhood==

=== Identity formation ===

The primary effect is that of learning: consistent with Bandura's (1986) social cognitive theory, much evidence shows that children learn from positive and negative televised role models, and acquire norms and standards for conduct through media outlets such as television and video games. This is supported by a study by Cynthia Hoffner with children aged 7–12, which showed that the gender of children's favorite televised characters was strongly correlated to the gender of the children. Furthermore, the research showed "wishful identification" with parasocial relationships, namely, that boys preferred intelligence, while girls preferred attractiveness when picking favorite characters. These alternatives are both enhanced and mitigated by their separation from reality. 
On one hand, parasocial interactions are particularly appealing to adolescents in the throes of identity formation and increasing autonomy from parents because these relationships provide idealized figures with whom the adolescent can envision total acceptance. The lack of actual contact with these idealized figures can offer positive social interactions without risk of rejection or consequent feelings of unworthiness. One cannot know everything about a media figure or icon, allowing adolescents to attach fantasized attributes onto these figures in order to meet their own specific wants or needs. On the other hand, entities far removed from reality tend to be less influential on children.

A study by Rosaen and Dibble examined correlation between realism of favorite television character and strength of parasocial relationships. Results showed a positive correlation between social realism (how realistic the character is) and strength of parasocial relationships. Results also show age-related differences among children. Older children tended to prefer more realistic characters, while younger children generally had more powerful parasocial relationships with any character. Age, however, did not impact the correlation between social realism and strength of parasocial interaction, which suggests that more real characters are grounds for more powerful parasocial relationships in children of all ages.

=== Learning through the media ===

The ability to learn from parasocial relationships is directly correlated to the strength of the relationship, as has been shown in work by [[Sandra L. Calvert]] and colleagues. In a study by Lauricella, Gola, and Calvert (2011), eight 21-month-old infants were taught seriation sequencing by one of two characters. One character, Elmo, is iconic in American culture and therefore socially meaningful, and the other, DoDo, although popular with children in Taiwan, is less well known in American media. Children were better able to learn from the socially meaningful character (Elmo) than from the character who was less easily recognized (DoDo). Furthermore, children could become better able to learn from less socially-relevant characters such as DoDo, by developing a parasocial relationship with that character. Accordingly, after children were given DoDo toys to play with, their ability to learn from that character increased. In a later study, this effect was found to be greatest when children showed stronger parasocial relationships: Children's success on the seriation task, and therefore their ability to learn from a less familiar character, was greatest for children who exhibited more emotional nurturing behaviors toward the DoDo toy during play (Gola, Richards, Lauricella, &amp; Calvert, 2013).

Personalization of a character makes a child more likely to nurture the character, and thus more likely to form a parasocial relationship that would improve learning from videos featuring the character (Calvert, Richards, &amp; Kent, 2014). In place of DoDo and Elmo, Calvert et al. (2014) gave children Scout and Violet dolls. These interactive plush toy dogs can be programmed to say a child's name and have particular favorites (i.e., a favorite food, color, and song). 18-month-old children were given either personalized toys ( matched for gender, programmed to say the child's name, and programmed to have the same favorites as the child) or non-personalized toys (the opposite gender, programmed to call the children "Pal" and have random favorites). At the end of the study, children who had received personalized dolls were better able to learn from their characters than were children who had received non-personalized toys. Children also nurtured personalized toys more than non-personalized toys. It seems that perceived similarities increase children's interest and investment in the characters, which motivates the development of parasocial relationships and helps improve later screen-based learning.

==Negative consequences in childhood==

In the past two decades, people have become increasingly interested in the potential negative impacts media has on people's' behavior and cognition. Many researchers have begun to look more closely at how people's relationships with various media outlets affect behavior, self-perception and attachment styles, and specifically in regards to creating parasocial relationships.

=== Body image ===

Further research has examined these relationships with regard to body image and self-perception. Interest in this more narrow area of research has increased as body image issues have become more prevalent in today's society.

A study was conducted to examine the relationship between media exposure and adolescents' body image. Specifically, researchers looked at parasocial relationships and the different motivations for self-comparison with a character. This study surveyed 391 7th and 8th grade students and found that media exposure negatively predicted body image. In addition to the direct negative impact, the study indicated that parasocial relationships with favorite characters, motivations to self-compare, and engagement in social comparison with characters amplified the negative effects on kids' body images. Furthermore, the researchers found that making social comparisons with favorite characters distorted actual, or ideal, body image and self-perception. Studies have been done exploring these effects across gender.

A study examined the parasocial relationships between men and superheroes; the study looked at muscular vs. non-muscular superheroes and men who either did or did not develop a one-sided psychological bond with a superhero character. The results from this study indicated a significant impact on body image, particularly when exposed to muscular superhero characters. The research found that men who formed a parasocial relationship with a muscular superhero had poor self-perception and felt negatively about their own bodies after exposure to the muscular character.

=== Aggression ===

Further studies have looked into parasocial relationships and more specifically at the impacts on violent and aggressive behavior. A study done by Keren Eyal and Alan M. Rubin examined aggressive and violent television characters and the potential negative impacts they may have on viewers. The study was based on social cognitive theory and looked at trait aggression in viewers and identification and parasocial interaction with aggressive characters. The researchers measured trait aggression in each of the participants and compared that to the level of identification with aggressive characters.The study found that more aggressive viewers were more likely to identify with aggressive characters and further develop parasocial relationships with the aggressive characters.

Parasocial interaction has been linked to psychological [[attachment theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cole | first1 = T. | last2 = Leets | first2 = L. | year = 1999 | title = Attachment styles and intimate television viewing. Insecurely forming relationships in a parasocial way | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 495–511 | doi=10.1177/0265407599164005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its consequences have seen the same dramatic effects as real [[Relationship breakup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = J | year = 2004 | title = Parasocial break-up from favorite television characters: The role of attachment styles and relationship intensity | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 187–202 | doi=10.1177/0265407504041374}}&lt;/ref&gt; In considering the relationship between parasocial interaction and attachment styles, Cohen (2004) found that individuals who were more anxious media consumers tended to be more invested in parasocial relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Jonathan|title=Parasocial Break-Up from Favorite Television Characters: The Role of Attachment Styles and Relationship Intensity|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|date=1 April 2004|volume=21|issue=2|pages=187–202|doi=10.1177/0265407504041374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parasocial interaction there is no "normal" [[social interaction]]; it is a very one-sided relation. The knowledgeable side has no direct control over the actions of the side it observes, and it is very difficult for it to contact and influence it.

=== Parasocial breakup ===

While much research focuses on the formation and maintenance of parasocial relationships, other research has begun to focus on what happens when a parasocial relationship is dissolved. Eyal and Cohen define parasocial breakup as "a situation where a character with whom a viewer has developed a PSR goes off the air."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eyal|first1=K.|last2=Cohen|first2=J.|title=When Good "Friends" Say Goodbye: A Parasocial Breakup Study|journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|date=2006|volume=50|issue=3|pages=502–523|doi=10.1207/s15506878jobem5003_9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eyal and Cohen (2006) found that the [[distress (medicine)|distress]] that media consumers experienced after a parasocial breakup was quite similar to that of a social relationship. However, the emotional distress experienced after the parasocial breakup was weaker than that of the real life interpersonal relationship. Lather and Moyer-Guse (2011) also considered the concept of parasocial breakup, but in a more temporary sense. While the study focused on parasocial breakups as a result of the writers' strike from 2007-2008, the researchers found that media consumers still experienced different levels of emotional distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lather|first1=J.|last2=Moyer-Guse|first2=E.|title=How do we react when our favorite characters are taken away? An examination of a temporary parasocial breakup|journal=Mass Communication and Society|date=2011|volume=14|issue=2|pages=196–215|doi=10.1080/15205431003668603}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study, like previous studies, showed that parasocial relationships operate very similarly to real-life relationships.

==On the Internet==
Though most literature has focused on parasocial interaction as a television and film phenomenon, new technologies, namely the [[Internet]], have necessitated a closer look at such interactions. The applications of PSI to computer-mediated environments are continuously documented in literature in last decade (Ballantine and Martin 2005; Goldberg and Allen 2008; Labrecque, 2014). Many researchers concluded that, just as parasocial relationships are present in television and radio, they are also present in online environments such as blogs and other [[social networking]] sites. Through an exploration of followers on politicians' blogs, Thorson and Rodgers (2006) found that parasocial interacting with the politician influences people's opinions about the politician, and promotes them to vote for the politician. Social media is designed to be a new channel through which parasocial interaction/relationship can be formed. Research has shown that interacting with individuals through blogs and social media such as Twitter can influence the perceptions of those individuals (Thorson &amp; Rodgers, 2006; Frederick, et al., 2012). As Internet users become more active on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, followers often feel more engaged with them, making the parasocial relationships stronger.

In 1998, John Eighmey, from [[Iowa State University]], and Lola McCord, from the [[University of Alabama]], published a study titled "Adding Value in the Information Age: Uses and Gratifications of Sites on the [[World Wide Web]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296397000611 |title=Adding Value in the Information Age: Uses and Gratifications of Sites on the World Wide Web |journal=Journal of Business Research |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=187–194 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2014-03-26 |doi=10.1016/S0148-2963(97)00061-1|year=1998 |last1=Eighmey |first1=John |last2=McCord |first2=Lola }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the study, they observed that the presence of parasocial relationships constituted an important determinant of [[Website visitor tracking|website visitation rates]]. "It appears," the study states, "that websites projecting a strong sense of personality may also encourage the development of a kind of parasocial relationship with website visitors."

In 1999, John Hoerner, from the [[University of Alabama]], published a study titled "Scaling the Web: A Parasocial Interaction Scale for World Wide Web Sites",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Df2BgZD9lxQC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=scaling+the+web:+a+parasocial+Interaction+Scale+for+World+Wide+Web+Sites | title = Advertising and the World Wide Web | isbn = 9781410602060 |last1=Schumann |first1=David W |first2=Esther |last2=Thorson |date=1999-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he proposed a method for measuring the effects of parasocial interaction on the Internet. The study explained that [[website]]s may feature "personae" that host to the visitors to the sites in order to generate public interest. Personae, in some cases, are nothing more than the online representations of the actual people, often prominent public figures, but sometimes, according to the study, will be the fictional creations of the sites' webmasters. Personae "take on many of the characteristics of a [real-life] companion, including regular and frequent appearances, a sense of immediacy...and the feeling of a face-to-face meeting." Additionally, the study makes the point that, even when no such personae have been created, parasocial relationships might still develop. Webmasters might foster parasocial interactions through a conversational writing style, extensive character development and opportunities for email exchange with the website's persona.

Hoerner used the Parasocial Interaction (PSI) scale, developed by Rubin, Perse, and Powell (1985), and modified the scale to more accurately assess parasocial interactions on the Internet. They used the scale to gauge participants' reactions to a number of different websites, and, more generally, to determine whether or not parasocial interaction theory could be linked to Internet use. The study concluded, first, that parasocial interaction is not dependent on the presence of a traditional persona on a website; data showed that websites with described "strong personae" did not attract significantly more hits than other websites selected by the study conductors. "The literal, mediated personality from the newscast or soap opera of the past [around which the original PSI-scale was framed] is gone. The design metaphor, flow of the web experience, and styles of textual and graphic presentations of the information all become elements of a website persona and encourage parasocial interaction by the visitor/user with that persona."

The study also confirmed the accuracy of the "PSI web scale" as a way to gauge consumer parasocial interaction with websites.

Social media is defined as "Internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0 and that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Andreas M.|last2=Haenlein|first2=Michael|date=2010|title=Users of the world, unite! The challenges and opportunities of Social Media|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0007681309001232|journal=Business Horizons|volume=53|issue=1|pages=61|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2009.09.003|issn=0007-6813|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While use of social media for personal use is common, the use of social media by celebrities has given them an opportunity to have a larger platform for personal causes or brand promotion by facilitating word-of-mouth. In recent years, companies and brands have taken this opportunity to use celebrities to aide in impacting such key elements of the company-consumer relationship as brand image and brand awareness (Jansen et al. 2009). For example, Katy Perry currently serves as the top most followed individual on Twitter for having over 109 million followers. The more followers one has on Twitter,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|title=Twitter|date=2018-06-24|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twitter&amp;oldid=847306583|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the greater perceived social influence one has. This is particularly because tweets are broadcast to each and every follower,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=List of most-followed Twitter accounts|date=2018-06-20|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_most-followed_Twitter_accounts&amp;oldid=846649014|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; who may then retweet these posts on their own profiles, which are then rebroadcast to thousands of other Twitter members (Schaefer 2012; Scott 2011). It is no coincidence that to be "trending" (i.e., phrases or topics that are tagged at a greater rate than others) on Twitter at any given point in time is equivalent to having one's movie become a box-office hit or one's hit single rank on the Billboard chart; in other words, Twitter can be utilized as a form of social capital (Jin 2013; Li and Bernoff 2011; Putnam 2000).

In a 2014 journal article Seung-A Annie Jin and Joe Phua discussed how they conducted studies to determine multiple hypothesis based on the number of followers a celebrity had in correlation to the trust that imparted onto a consumer.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jin|first=Seung-A Annie|last2=Phua|first2=Joe|date=2014-04-03|title=Following Celebrities' Tweets About Brands: The Impact of Twitter-Based Electronic Word-of-Mouth on Consumers' Source Credibility Perception, Buying Intention, and Social Identification With Celebrities|url=|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=43|issue=2|pages=181–195|doi=10.1080/00913367.2013.827606|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study was done in terms of a celebrity endorsing a product and the consumer's likely to purchase the product after seeing the promotion. Consumers perceived the celebrity with a high number of followers as being more physically attractive, trustworthy, and competent. A high number of followers on the celebrity endorser's profile also significantly increased consumers' intention to build an online friendship with the celebrity. The study found that if a celebrity with a higher number of followers was found to be more trustworthy and the consumer exhibited significantly higher postexposure product involvement and buying intention as opposed to those who were exposed to a celebrity with a lower follower count.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Social media networks inherit at least one key attribute from the Internet, in that they offer open accessibility for all users. Philip Drake and Andy Miah argue that the Internet, and therefore social networks and blogs, downsize the gatekeeping processes that exist in other mass media forms. They further state that this means that online information can spread unfiltered and thus does not rest on strict framework conditions such as those on television or in newspapers. This, however, remains subject to an ongoing debate within research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drake|first=Philip|last2=Miah|first2=Andy|date=2010-03-01|title=The Cultural Politics of Celebrity|url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/cultural-politics/article-abstract/6/1/49/8002/The-Cultural-Politics-of-Celebrity|journal=Cultural Politics|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=49–64|doi=10.2752/175174310X12549254318746|issn=1743-2197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://link.galegroup.com.libdata.lib.ua.edu/apps/doc/A244276463/PPCM?u=tusc49521&amp;sid=PPCM&amp;xid=3bee8234|title=E-Resource Login|website=link.galegroup.com.libdata.lib.ua.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through presence on social media platforms, stars and celebrities attempt on the one hand to participate in the production of their image; on the other hand, they must remain present in these media in order to stay on the media’s and consequently on the audience’s agenda. According to Daschmann (2007),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gleich|first=Uli|date=2008|title=Thomas Schierl (Hrsg.) (2007): Prominenz in den Medien.

The audience’s consumption and reception symbolizes the necessary “fuel” to keep the economic enterprise of celebrity going.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Redmond|first=Sean|title=Introduction: What's in a Reader?|date=2007|url=http://sk.sagepub.com/books/stardom-and-celebrity/n1.xml|work=Stardom and Celebrity: A Reader|pages=1–11|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd|access-date=2018-07-09|last2=Holmes|first2=Su}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outlining the interdependency between celebrity status and the audience, Wippersberg (2007) emphasizes that a celebrity can only become and remain a celebrity if the audience embraces and thus perceives the individual celebrity as a celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Peters|first=Birgit|date=1996|pages=101–118|publisher=VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften|language=de|doi=10.1007/978-3-322-97067-1_7|isbn=9783531127842|title=Prominenz|chapter=Der Einfluß massenmedialer Rahmenbedingungen auf Entstehung und Erscheinungsbild von Prominenz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most celebrities, aware of the rising importance of social media (for their audience), now themselves actively use these networks, by running their own profiles and making raw and real-time information and content available to the social media community and fans. It allows them to promote themselves and their “products” (i.e. music, albums, movies, shows) by directly communicating with their audience. Nowadays a fan can more easily to get “in touch” with celebrities (as fan mails don’t need to be hand-written and sent though regular mail anymore) by way of comments on photos or videos posted by the celebrity themselves. Often, and dependent upon the celebrity and their personal management of their social profiles, the celebrity may respond to a comment of a random fan or follow. The development of parasocial relationships between the audience/fans and celebrities is facilitated. The process also calls into question the one-way nature of parasocial interaction because celebrities, on the outer surface seem to try to get more and more in contact with their audiences. Researchers now raise the question of how social media, i.e., social networks, have modified these parasocial interactions between the celebrities and their audience.

==Future research==

One direction for future PSI concerns the advancement of methodology. As theories become more defined and complex, experiments seem to be necessary to be employed in testing hypotheses. Because the meanings of perception and emotion take up much of what parasocial interaction/relationship research interest, the cause and effect is hard to be distinguished and potential spuriousness is difficult to be avoided (Oliver &amp; Raney, 2014). For example, whether similarity precedes PSI and whether mediated interaction create a sense of similarity requires experimental validation (Murphy, Frank, Moran, &amp; Patnoe-Woodley, 2011).

Cohen (2001) also suggested that different types of relationships are encouraged to be analyzed by different genres, which particularly challenges scholars in examine the mediated relationship in those reality TVs (e.g., Survivor) (Nabi, Stitt, Halford, &amp; Finnerty. 2006). These prototypical reality shows which are built around narratives, displaying a lot of emotions which seem to invite [[empathy]] and identification, and also demonstrating the characters' skills as to develop [[fandom]]. Ratings and audience responses provide strong evidence that those reality shows create significant mediated relationship, but future inquiries should examine whether this new kind of mediated interaction/relationship evolves or do these interactions/relationships conform to existing patterns (Oliver &amp; Raney, 2014).

The influence of media in childhood has received little attention from [[developmental psychologist]]s, even though children have a high degree of exposure to media. While many studies and experiments have explored the nature of parasocial relationships, there are many opportunities for future research. For example, a potential future area of research could be the issue of reruns, where the relationships have outcomes which are already known or well-established. In addition, another area of research could focus on production techniques or televisual approaches. This would include techniques such as chiaroscuro or flat lighting, the strategic placement of close-ups or establishing shots, deductive or inductive shot sequences, hip hop editing, or desaturation. These techniques have long been theorized to have some sort of influence on the formation of parasocial relationships, but their influence has yet to be determined.

The prevailing use of social media and its impact on mediated relationships also requires further study of PSI (Branch, Wilson, &amp; Agnew, 2013). Different social media platforms provide channels through which celebrities communicate with their followers easily, making parasocial interaction/relationships seem less unidirectional and perhaps more satisfying and intense (Labrecque, 2014). As such, whether social media has made PSI more a part of everyday life needs further exploration. Baek, Bae, and Jang (2013) also mentioned that technological development have been raising questions regarding the role of PSI in our social lives, as media content is available in more places and times. Our mediated friends are never too far away, instead, they actually rest in our pockets and sleep in our beds. Whether this means that we spend more time and effort on cultivating these relationships and will be less dependent on real social relationships, needs further exploration (Labrecque, 2014).

Other concerns include the continuity of media figures representation across various media outlets, and the notion of parasocial interaction as compensation for lack of social outlets. Popstars, for example, may not only appear on television, but on several different television or radio programs, as either a chat guest or a performer; further repeated viewings of these stars would intensify visual aspects of parasocial interaction with that star. Most research has typically characterized media users as a television viewer who is often solitary and in need of social interaction. The different types of user-figure interaction can be addressed by conceptualizing parasocial interaction as an extension of ordinary social interaction. Through close examination of social encounters that are significant for parasocial relationships, we can continue to distinguish between parasocial interaction an isolated activity and longer-term interaction.

'''''Patriarchy''''' is a 2007 book by [[V. Geetha]], an academic activist and author on the subject of [[patriarchy]] in [[India]]. The book, written from the female perspective, is part of the "Theorizing Feminism" series published by Stree (an imprint of [[Bhatkal and Sen]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-bookreview/patriarchy-through-the-feminist-lens/article1446078.ece|title = Patriarchy Through the Feminist Lens|last = Swaminathan|first = Padmini|date = 2 January 2008|work = The Hindu|access-date = 22 August 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three editions have been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.worldcat.org/title/patriarchy/oclc/154204766/editions?editionsView=true&amp;referer=br|title = Patriarchy listing on WorldCat|date = |accessdate = 22 August 2015|website = WorldCat|publisher = OCLC|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In India, [[patriarchy]] disrupts women's lives. According to Geetha,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.saarthakindia.org/womens_situation_India.html|title = Women's Situation in India|date = |accessdate = 22 August 2015|website = Saarthak|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Sexual violence has been blamed on a patriarchal backlash where the term 'patriarchy' is often synonymous with 'tradition{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/17/sexual-violence-india-patriarchal-narendra-modi-women-reform-rape|title = Sexual Violence in India is a Patriarchal Backlash That Must Be Stopped|last = Virmani|first = Priya|date = 17 June 2014|work = The Guardian|access-date = 22 August 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feminism]] has a long tradition of examining the concept of patriarchy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://isj.org.uk/theories-of-patriarchy/|title = Theories of Patriarchy|last = German|first = Lindsey|date = 1981|journal = International Socialism|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 22 August 2015|issue = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the book attempts to demonstrate that the nature, effect, and meanings of male authority and power can only be understood through the idea of patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;V.Geetha. (2007).patriarchy. theorizing feminism. series editor Maithreyi Krishnaraj. Kolkata:Mandira Sen for STREE. page 203&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
''Patriarchy'' introduces readers to [[concept]]s in [[feminist theory]] involving [[patriarchy]]. According to Geetha, "The book does not propound a theory of patriarchy; rather, it points to those areas of reality and traditions of knowledge that we might need to draw upon to define patriarchy. It indicates the need for theory-making, and shows how this may be done. Its intent is fundamentally [[pedagogical]] and is a beginners' text to help the reader consider patriarchy in all its aspects".&lt;ref&gt;V.Geetha. (2007).patriarchy. theorizing feminism. series editor Maithreyi Krishnaraj. Kolkata:Mandira Sen for STREE. page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

She describes how knowledge about patriarchy cannot be easily separated from the feminist desire to generate such knowledge:&lt;ref&gt;V.Geetha. (2007).patriarchy. theorizing feminism. series editor Maithreyi Krishnaraj. Kolkata:Mandira Sen for STREE. page 4- 61&lt;/ref&gt; "By understanding patriarchy, the notions of production and reproduction are important concepts". Geetha highlights unique aspects of [[Culture of India|Indian society]], such as kinship structures and the [[caste system]],&lt;ref&gt;V.Geetha. (2007).patriarchy. theorizing feminism. series editor Maithreyi Krishnaraj. Kolkata:Mandira Sen for STREE. page 61-131&lt;/ref&gt; to better understand patriarchy. According to the author, "A woman's identity as a citizen and rights to equality are undercut by the fact of their gender".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Geetha theorizes that patriarchal power "is not merely coercive ... Cultural and sexual [[norm (social)|norm]]s constitute the everyday exercise of patriarchal power".&lt;ref&gt;V.Geetha. (2007).patriarchy. theorizing feminism. series editor Maithreyi Krishnaraj. Kolkata:Mandira Sen for STREE. page 131- 203&lt;/ref&gt; She also writes, "Sexuality is a crucial link between [[caste]] and gender, so that [[marriage]] and sexual rules are not only set by caste, but also the notions of right pleasure are defined by it."&lt;ref&gt;V.Geetha. (2007).patriarchy. theorizing feminism. series editor Maithreyi Krishnaraj. Kolkata:Mandira Sen for STREE. page 204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3705692 | pmid=23858264 | doi=10.4103/0019-5545.105547 | volume=55 | title=Indian religious concepts on sexuality and marriage | year=2013 | journal=Indian J Psychiatry | pages=S256–62 | last1 = Mahajan | first1 = PT | last2 = Pimple | first2 = P | last3 = Palsetia | first3 = D | last4 = Dave | first4 = N | last5 = De Sousa | first5 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12212">The '''phantom time hypothesis''' is a historical [[conspiracy theory]] asserted by Heribert Illig. First published in 1991, it hypothesizes a conspiracy by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto III]], [[Pope Sylvester II]], and possibly the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine VII]], to fabricate the [[Anno Domini]] dating system retrospectively, in order to place them at the special year of AD 1000, and to rewrite history&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Ulrich Niemitz, [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/volatile/Niemitz-1997.pdf ''Did the Early Middle Ages Really Exist?''] pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; to legitimize Otto's claim to the Holy Roman Empire. Illig believed that this was achieved through the alteration, misrepresentation and forgery of documentary and physical evidence.&lt;ref name="fomenko1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly | year = 2007 | publisher = Mithec | isbn = 2-913621-07-4 | title = History: Chronology 1: Second Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this scenario, the entire [[Carolingian period]], including the figure of [[Charlemagne]], is a fabrication, with a "phantom time" of 297 years (AD 614–911) added to the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The proposal has been universally rejected by mainstream historians.

== Heribert Illig ==
Illig was born in 1947 in [[Vohenstrauß]], [[Bavaria]].
He was active in an association dedicated to [[Immanuel Velikovsky]], [[catastrophism]] and [[historical revisionism]],
''Gesellschaft zur Rekonstruktion der Menschheits- und Naturgeschichte''.
From 1989 to 1994 he acted as editor of the journal ''Vorzeit-Frühzeit-Gegenwart''.
Since 1995, he has worked as a publisher and author under his own publishing company, ''Mantis-Verlag'', and publishing his own journal, ''Zeitensprünge''.
Outside of his publications related to revised chronology, he has edited the works of [[Egon Friedell]].

Before focusing on the early medieval period, Illig published various proposals for revised chronologies of prehistory and of Ancient Egypt.
His proposals received prominent coverage in German popular media in the 1990s. His 1996 ''Das erfundene Mittelalter'' also received scholarly recensions, but was universally rejected as fundamentally flawed by historians.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Fried: ''Wissenschaft und Phantasie. Das Beispiel der Geschichte'', in: Historische Zeitschrift Band 263,2/1996, 291–316.
Matthias Grässlin, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 1. Oktober 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1997, the journal ''Ethik und Sozialwissenschaften'' offered a platform for critical discussion to Illig's proposal, with a number of historians commenting on its various aspects.&lt;ref&gt;EuS 1997 Heft 4.
Theo Kölzer (Bonn University) refused to contribute, and the journal printed his letter of refusal instead in which Kölzer criticizes the journal for lending credibility to Illig's "abstruse" idea.
A favourable review was published by sociologist Gunnar Heinsohn, which later led to a collaboration between Illig and Heinsohn until 2011, when Heinsohn left the board of editors of Illig's journal and published his rejection of Illig's core idea that the figure of Charlemagne is a high medieval fiction.&lt;/ref&gt;
After 1997, there has been little scholarly reception of Illig's ideas, although they continued to be discussed as [[pseudohistory]] in German popular media.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Borgolte]]. In: [[Der Tagesspiegel]] vom 29. Juni 1999. Stephan Matthiesen: ''[http://www.stephan-matthiesen.de/de/texte/archaeologie-geschichte/erfundenes-mittelalter-illig.html Erfundenes Mittelalter – fruchtlose These!]'', in: Skeptiker 2/2001&lt;/ref&gt;
Illig continued to publish on the "phantom time hypothesis" until at least 2013.
Also in 2013, he published on an unrelated topic of [[art history]], on [[German Renaissance]] master [[Anton Pilgram]], but again proposing revisions to conventional chronology, and arguing for the abolition of the art historical category of [[Mannerism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Meister Anton, gen. Pilgram, oder Abschied vom Manierismus'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposal ==
The bases of Illig's hypothesis include:&lt;ref name="Illig 1"&gt;{{cite book
 | first = Heribert | last = Illig
 | title = Wer hat an der Uhr gedreht? |isbn=3-548-75064-8 | publisher = Econ Verlag | year = 2000
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Illig 2"&gt;{{cite book
 | first = Heribert | last = Illig
 | title = Das erfundene Mittelalter |isbn=3-548-36429-2 | publisher = | year =
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The scarcity of [[Archaeology|archaeological]] evidence that can be reliably dated to the period AD 614–911, the perceived inadequacies of radiometric and [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] methods of dating this period, and the over-reliance of medieval historians on written sources.
* The presence of [[Romanesque architecture]] in tenth-century Western Europe, suggesting the Roman era was not as long ago as conventionally thought.
* The relation between the [[Julian calendar]], [[Gregorian calendar]] and the underlying astronomical [[tropical year|solar or tropical year]]. The Julian calendar, introduced by [[Julius Caesar]], was long known to introduce a discrepancy from the tropical year of around one day for each century that the calendar was in use. By the time the Gregorian calendar was introduced in AD 1582, Illig alleges that the old Julian calendar should have produced a discrepancy of thirteen days between it and the real (or tropical) calendar. Instead, the astronomers and mathematicians working for [[Pope Gregory XIII]] had found that the civil calendar needed to be adjusted by only ten days. (The Julian calendar day Thursday, 4 October 1582 was followed by the first day of the Gregorian calendar, Friday, 15 October 1582). From this, Illig concludes that the [[Anno Domini|AD]] era had counted roughly three centuries which never existed.

== Criticism ==
* The most difficult challenge to the theory is through observations in [[Archaeoastronomy|ancient astronomy]], especially those of [[solar eclipse]]s cited by European sources prior to 600 AD (when phantom time would have distorted the chronology). Besides several others that are perhaps too vague to disprove the phantom time hypothesis, two in particular are dated with enough precision to disprove the hypothesis with a high degree of certainty. One is reported by [[Pliny the Elder]] in 59 AD&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder. [http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm#BOOK%20II ''Natural History'' (Book II)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101063545/http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm |date=2017-01-01 }}, accessed 14 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and one by [[Photius]] in 418 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Photius. [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/philostorgius.htm ''Epitome of the Church History of Philosturgius''], accessed 4 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these dates and times have confirmed [[Lists of solar eclipses|eclipses]]. In addition, observations during the [[Tang dynasty]] in China, and [[Halley's Comet]], for example, are consistent with current astronomy with no "phantom time" added.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|surname1=Dieter Herrmann|periodical=Beiträge zur Astronomiegeschichte&amp;nbsp;3|title=Nochmals: Gab es eine Phantomzeit in unserer Geschichte? |year=2000|at=pp.&amp;nbsp;211–14|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dutch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dutch|first=Stephen|title=Is a Chunk of History Missing?|url=http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/PSEUDOSC/Phantom%20Time.HTM|accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Archaeological remains and dating methods such as [[dendrochronology]] refute, rather than support, "phantom time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Amalie |last=Fößel |title=Karl der Fiktive? |work=[[Damals]], Magazin für Geschichte und Kultur |issue=8 |year=1999 |pages=20f }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Gregorian reform was never purported to bring the calendar in line with the Julian calendar as it had existed at the time of its institution in 45 BC, but as it had existed in 325, the time of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], which had established a method for [[Computus|determining the date]] of [[Easter Sunday]] by fixing the [[vernal equinox]] on March 21 in the Julian calendar. By 1582, the astronomical equinox was occurring on March 10 in the Julian calendar, but Easter was still being calculated from a nominal equinox on March 21. In 45 BC the astronomical vernal equinox took place around March 23. Illig's "three missing centuries" thus correspond to the 369 years between the institution of the Julian calendar in 45 BC, and the fixing of the Easter Date at the Council of Nicaea in AD 325.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Mütz: ''Die „Phantomzeit“ 614 bis 911 von Heribert Illig. Kalendertechnische und kalenderhistorische Einwände.'' In: ''Zeitschrift für Württembergische Landesgeschichte.'' Band 60, 2001, S. 11–23.&lt;/ref&gt;
* If [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Carolingian dynasty]] were fabricated, there would have to be a corresponding fabrication of the history of the rest of Europe, including [[Anglo-Saxon England]], the [[History of the papacy|Papacy]], and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The "phantom time" period also encompasses the life of [[Muhammad]] and the [[Early Muslim conquests|Islamic expansion]] into the areas of the former Roman Empire, including the conquest of [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic Iberia]]. This history too would have to be forged or drastically misdated. It would also have to be reconciled with the history of the [[Tang dynasty]] of China and its contact with Islam, such as at the [[Battle of Talas]].&lt;ref name="Dutch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Cecil|title=Did the Middle Ages Not Really Happen?|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2992/did-the-middle-ages-not-really-happen|accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plasma gasification is in commercial use''' as a Waste-to-Energy system that converts municipal solid waste (MSW), tires, hazardous waste, and sewage sludge into synthesis gas (syngas) containing hydrogen and carbon monoxide that can be used to generate power. Municipal-scale waste disposal plasma arc facilities have been in operation in Japan and China since 2002. No commercial implementations in Europe and North America have succeeded so far. The technology is characterized by the potential of very high level of destruction of the incoming waste, but low or negative net energy production and high operational costs.

Plasma gasification is used commercially for waste disposal at five locations worldwide representing a design capacity of 200 tonnes of waste per day in total, of which 100 tonnes per day is biomass waste.

== Existing facilities ==

=== National Cheng Kung University - Tainan City, Taiwan (PEAT International) ===
PEAT International constructed a plasma arc waste disposal facility at [[National Cheng Kung University]] (NCKU) in [[Tainan City]], [[Taiwan]], which uses its proprietary Plasma Thermal Destruction Recovery method.  The facility is able to handle {{convert|3|-|5|MT|ST}} of waste per day from a variety of waste streams, including incinerator [[fly ash]], [[medical waste]], organic industrial process waste and inorganic sludges. It can also process waste consumer [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and other materials, including [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] sludges, and refinery [[catalyst]]s (waste streams that would generate valuable metal [[alloy]]s). The facility was constructed as part of a comprehensive [[resource recovery]] facility funded by the [[Government of the Republic of China|Taiwanese government]], marking the first time the Government of Taiwan committed financial and technical resources to the utilization of plasma technology.  It was commissioned in November 2004 and received its operating permit in January, 2005.

In 1999 a {{convert|166|ST|MT|adj=on}} per day "pilot" plant was built in [[Yoshii, Gunma|Yoshii]], co-developed by [http://www.hitachi-metals.co.jp/e/ '''Hitachi Metals Ltd.'''] and [http://www.westinghouse-plasma.com/ '''Westinghouse Plasma''']. It was certified after a demonstration period in 1999–2000. The Yoshii pilot plant was decommissioned when the pilot program ended in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/plasma-converter4.htm How Plasma Converters Work] from the Howstuffworks website&lt;/ref&gt;

A {{convert|165|ST|MT|adj=on}} per day plant was completed in 2002 in [[Utashinai, Hokkaidō|Utashinai City]]. It took over 5 years to start it up due to problems with size of the bottom of the reactor, carryover of sticky particulate, and the wrong choice of refractory.  As a result, it lost its waste supply contracts and did not meet its design heat and material balance, so Hitachi Metals shut it down in 2013.

In 2002 a {{convert|28|ST|MT|adj=on}} per day plant was commissioned in the twin cities of [[Mihama, Fukui|Mihama]] and [[Mikata, Fukui|Mikata]].&lt;ref name=williams2003&gt;{{Citation

=== Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (Plasco Energy Group Inc.) ===
A new and different type of plasma arc waste conversion that uses plasma to refine gases produced during waste conversion. [[Plasco Energy Group]] completed a  demonstration plant in [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]] at the Trail Road Landfill, to process {{convert|85|MT|ST}} per day of [[municipal solid waste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zerowasteottawa.com/en/About-Project/ |title=About the Project |publisher=A Partnership for a Zero Waste Ottawa |accessdate=2009-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420003312/http://www.zerowasteottawa.com/en/About-Project/ |archivedate=2009-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plasco Energy Group's process does not use plasma to destroy waste, but rather to refine gases produced during waste conversion, in order to allow them to be used to run an internal combustion gas engine. On 24 October 2007, the Plasco Trail Road facility began delivering power to the grid.

In an update to local area residents on 6 December 2008, Plasco president [[Rod Bryden]] said delays at its facility were caused by malfunctioning machinery, not problems with the waste-to-energy technology.&lt;ref name="clark2008"&gt;{{citation
 |first=Laura |last=Czekaj |title=Mechanical problems plague Plasco |newspaper=[[Ottawa Sun]] |publication-date=2008-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike conventional plasma gasification, the Plasco approach was to demonstrate the technology as an integrated plant at commercial scale at its own expense.  This resulted in enormous investment cost, but a proven product.

In December 2012, Plasco concluded a contract with the city of Ottawa for the construction of a three train commercial plant.  The plant would process up to 405 tonnes/day of municipal solid waste, producing 0.9 MW-hrs of net electrical power, 300 liters of water suitable for irrigation, and 150&amp;nbsp;kg of non-leachable aggregate for each tonne of waste processed.

On 28 August 2013, an article in the Ottawa Citizen reported that the Ottawa City Council had voted for the second time to extend a deadline by which Plasco was required to have arranged the $200 million required to construct the commercial scale plasma gasification facility near the Trail Road landfill.  The company now had until December 2014 to arrange financing.&lt;ref name="reevely201308"&gt;{{citation
 |first=David |last=Reevely |title=City extends Plasco Energy Group's financing deadline |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |publication-date=2013-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, Black &amp; Veatch declared the technology suitable for commercialization, as it had demonstrated net power generation through GE Jenbacher IC engines, commercially acceptable availability, and pristine environmental performance.  In December of the same year, the New Economy Magazine awarded Plasco a prize as "the world's best waste management technology".

Despite this, having failed to receive expected government aid, the investors chose not to pursue the construction of the Ottawa plant and put the company into creditor protection in 2015.  It was purchased out of creditor protection later that year, and is currently marketing its advanced technology.  Plasco Energy has since changed its business model from Build Own Operate and limited it to supply of equipment and services {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}.

On April 26, 2011, the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) inarguated its Transportable Plasma Waste to Energy System (TPWES) facility, located at Hurlburt Field, near Fort Walton Beach Florida, USA.  The facility was designed, constructed and commissioned by Montreal-based PyroGenesis Canada Inc., and the unit deployed at the facility was based on the company’s Plasma Resource Recovery System (PRRS) technology.  The plant was designed to process 10.5 metric tons per day of municipal solid waste, as well as hazardous and biomedical waste.  The syngas generated by the process was fed to an internal combustion engine to produce electricity, while the inorganic fraction of the waste feed was converted into an inert, vitrified slag which could allegedly be used for building materials. The system was designed to be energy neutral and transportable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afsoc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123253735 |title=AFSOC makes 'green' history while investing in future |publisher=US Air Force Special Operations Command |accessdate=2011-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509083529/http://www.afsoc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123253735 |archivedate=2011-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prescriptive analytics''' is the third and final phase of [[business analytics]], which also includes descriptive and [[Predictive analytics|predictive]] analytics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Evans,James R.  |author2=Lindner, Carl H. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Business Analytics: The Next Frontier for Decision Sciences|journal=Decision Line|date=March 2012|volume=43|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LustigEtAl"&gt;http://www.analytics-magazine.org/november-december-2010/54-the-analytics-journey{{cite journal|last=Lustig,Irv, Dietrich, Brenda, Johnson, Christer, and Dziekan, Christopher|title=The Analytics Journey|journal=Analytics|date=Nov–Dec 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Referred to as the "final frontier of analytic capabilities,"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.globys.com/2013/06/gartner-terms-prescriptive-analytics-%E2%80%9Cfinal-frontier%E2%80%9D-analytic-capabilities&lt;/ref&gt; prescriptive analytics entails the application of [[mathematical sciences|mathematical]] and [[computational science]]s and suggests decision options to take advantage of the results of descriptive and predictive analytics.  The first stage of business analytics is descriptive analytics, which still accounts for the majority of all business analytics today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davenport,Tom |title=The three '..tives' of business analytics; predictive, prescriptive and descriptive|journal=CIO Enterprise Forum|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptive analytics looks at past performance and understands that performance by mining historical data to look for the reasons behind past success or failure. Most management reporting – such as [[sales]], [[marketing]], [[Business operations|operations]], and [[finance]] – uses this type of post-mortem analysis.

[[File:Three Phases of Analytics.png|thumb|left|350px|Prescriptive Analytics extends beyond predictive analytics by specifying both the actions necessary to achieve predicted outcomes, and the interrelated effects of each decision]]The next phase is [[predictive analytics]]. Predictive analytics answers the question what is likely to happen. This is when historical data is combined with rules, [[algorithms]], and occasionally external data to determine the probable future outcome of an event or the likelihood of a situation occurring. The final phase is prescriptive analytics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haas, Peter J., Maglio, Paul P., Selinger, Patricia G., and Tan, Wang-Chie|title=Data is Dead…Without What-If Models|journal=Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment|year=2011|volume=4|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which goes beyond predicting future outcomes by also suggesting actions to benefit from the predictions and showing the implications of each decision option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Stewart, Thomas. R. |author2=McMillan, Claude, Jr.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Descriptive and Prescriptive Models for Judgment and Decision Making: Implications for Knowledge Engineering|journal=NATO AS1 Senes, Expert Judgment and Expert Systems|year=1987|volume=F35|pages=314–318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescriptive analytics not only anticipates what will happen and when it will happen, but also why it will happen&lt;!-- There is no evidence nor citation supporting this statement. Furthermore, if prescriptive analytics analytics "not only anticipates what will happen and when it will happen, but also why it will happen, then what is the role of predictive modelling, forecasting and causal modelling? --&gt;. Further, prescriptive analytics suggests decision options on how to take advantage of a future opportunity or mitigate a future risk and shows the implication of each decision option. Prescriptive analytics can continually take in new data to re-predict and re-prescribe, thus automatically improving prediction accuracy&lt;!-- This lacks evidence and supporting citation. It does not follow that prediction accuracy improves as a result of re-predicting. --&gt; and prescribing better decision options. Prescriptive analytics ingests hybrid data, a combination of structured (numbers, categories) and unstructured data (videos, images, sounds, texts), and business rules to predict what lies ahead and to prescribe how to take advantage of this predicted future without compromising other priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riabacke, Mona, Danielson, Mats, and Ekenber, Love |title=State-of-the-Art Prescriptive Criteria Weight Elicitation|journal=Advances in Decision Sciences|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three phases of analytics can be performed through professional services or technology or a combination.  In order to scale, prescriptive analytics technologies need to be adaptive to take into account the growing volume, velocity, and variety of data that most mission critical processes and their environments may produce.

One criticism of prescriptive analytics is that its distinction from [[predictive analytics]] is ill-defined and therefore ill-conceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bill Vorhies|url=http://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/patimes/prescriptive-versus-predictive-analytics-distinction-without-difference/ |title=Prescriptive versus Predictive Analytics – A Distinction without a Difference?|journal=Predictive Analytics Times|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Components of Prescriptive Analytics.png|thumb|600px|The scientific disciplines that comprise Prescriptive Analytics]]

==History==

Prescriptive analytics incorporates both structured and unstructured data, and uses a combination of advanced analytic techniques and disciplines to predict, prescribe, and adapt. While the term prescriptive analytics was first coined by IBM&lt;ref name="LustigEtAl"/&gt; and later trademarked by Ayata,&lt;ref&gt;http://trademarks.justia.com/852/06/prescriptive-analytics-85206495.html&lt;/ref&gt; the underlying concepts have been around for hundreds of years. The technology behind prescriptive analytics synergistically combines hybrid [[data]], business rules with [[mathematical model]]s and [[computational model]]s. The data inputs to prescriptive analytics may come from multiple sources: internal, such as inside a corporation; and external, also known as environmental data.  The data may be structured, which includes numbers and categories, as well as [[unstructured data]], such as texts, images, sounds, and videos. Unstructured data differs from [[structured data]] in that its format varies widely and cannot be stored in traditional relational databases without significant effort at data transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Inmon|first=Bill|author2=Nesavich, Anthony|title=Tapping Into Unstructured Data|year=2007|publisher=Prentice-Hall|isbn=978-0-13-236029-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 80% of the world's data today is unstructured, according to IBM.

In addition to this variety of data types and growing data volume, incoming data can also evolve with respect to velocity, that is, more data being generated at a faster or a variable pace. Business rules define the [[business process]] and include objectives constraints, preferences, policies, best practices, and boundaries. Mathematical models and computational models are techniques derived from mathematical sciences, computer science and related disciplines such as applied statistics, machine learning, operations research, natural language processing, computer vision, pattern recognition, image processing, speech recognition, and signal processing. The correct application of all these methods and the verification of their results implies the need for resources on a massive scale including human, computational and temporal for every Prescriptive Analytic project. In order to spare the expense of dozens of people, high performance machines and weeks of work one must consider the reduction of resources and therefore a reduction in the accuracy or reliability of the outcome. The preferable route is a reduction that produces a probabilistic result within acceptable limits.

==Applications in Oil and Gas==

[[File:Key Questions Prescriptive Analytics software answers for oil and gas producers.png|thumb|right|450px|Key Questions Prescriptive Analytics software answers for oil and gas producers]]Energy is the largest industry in the world ($6 trillion in size). The processes and decisions related to oil and natural gas exploration, development and production generate large amounts of data. Many types of captured data are used to create models and images of the Earth’s structure and layers 5,000 - 35,000 feet below the surface and to describe activities around the wells themselves, such as depositional characteristics, machinery performance, oil flow rates, reservoir temperatures and pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Basu, Atanu|title= How Prescriptive Analytics Can Reshape Fracking in Oil and Gas Fields|journal= Data-Informed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescriptive analytics software can help with both locating and producing hydrocarbons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=  Basu, Atanu |title= How Data Analytics Can Help Frackers Find Oil |journal= Datanami|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
by taking in seismic data, well log data, production data, and other related data sets to prescribe specific recipes for how and where to drill, complete, and produce wells in order to optimize recovery, minimize cost, and reduce environmental footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Mohan, Daniel |title= Machines Prescribing Recipes from 'Things,' Earth, and People |journal =Oil &amp; Gas Investor|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unconventional Resource Development===

[[File:Varied datasets.png|thumb|right|450px|Examples of structured and unstructured data sets generated and by the oil and gas companies and their ecosystem of service providers that can be analyzed together using Prescriptive Analytics software]]With the value of the end product determined by global commodity economics, the basis of competition for operators in upstream E&amp;P is the ability to effectively deploy capital to locate and extract resources more efficiently, effectively, predictably, and safely than their peers.  In unconventional resource plays, operational efficiency and effectiveness is diminished by reservoir inconsistencies, and decision-making impaired by high degrees of uncertainty.   These challenges manifest themselves in the form of low recovery factors and wide performance variations.

Prescriptive Analytics software can accurately predict production and prescribe optimal configurations of controllable drilling, completion, and production variables by modeling numerous internal and external variables simultaneously, regardless of source, structure, size, or format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Basu, Mohan, Marshall, &amp; McColpin |title=The Journey to Designer Wells |journal=Oil &amp; Gas Investor |date=December 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescriptive analytics software can also provide decision options and show the impact of each decision option so the operations managers can proactively take appropriate actions, on time, to guarantee future exploration and production performance, and maximize the economic value of assets at every point over the course of their serviceable lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mohan, Daniel |title=Your Data Already Know What You Don't |journal=E&amp;P Magazine |date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oilfield Equipment Maintenance===

In the realm of oilfield equipment maintenance, Prescriptive Analytics can optimize configuration, anticipate and prevent unplanned downtime, optimize field scheduling, and improve maintenance planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Presley, Jennifer |title=ESP for ESPs |journal=Exploration &amp; Production |date=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to General Electric, there are more than 130,000 electric submersible pumps (ESP's) installed globally, accounting for 60% of the world's oil production.&lt;ref&gt;{http://www.ge-energy.com/products_and_services/products/electric_submersible_pumping_systems/}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prescriptive Analytics has been deployed to predict when and why an ESP will fail, and recommend the necessary actions to prevent the failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wheatley, Malcolm |title=Underground Analytics |journal=DataInformed |date=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of [[Health, Safety and Environment|Health, Safety, and Environment]], prescriptive analytics can predict and preempt incidents that can lead to reputational and financial loss for oil and gas companies.

===Pricing===

Pricing is another area of focus. [[Natural gas prices]] fluctuate dramatically depending upon supply, demand, [[econometrics]], [[geopolitics]], and weather conditions. Gas producers, pipeline transmission companies and [[Utility companies|utility firms]] have a keen interest in more accurately predicting gas prices so that they can lock in favorable terms while hedging downside risk. Prescriptive analytics software can accurately predict prices by modeling internal and external variables simultaneously and also provide decision options and show the impact of each decision option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Watson, Michael|title=Advanced Analytics in Supply Chain - What is it, and is it Better than Non-Advanced Analytics?|journal=Supply Chain Digest|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications in healthcare==

Multiple factors are driving [[healthcare]] providers to dramatically improve business processes and operations as the [[Health care in the United States|United States healthcare]] industry embarks on the necessary migration from a largely fee-for service, volume-based system to a fee-for-performance, value-based system. Prescriptive analytics is playing a key role to help improve the performance in a number of areas involving various stakeholders: payers, providers and pharmaceutical companies.

Prescriptive analytics can help providers improve effectiveness of their clinical care delivery to the population they manage and in the process achieve better patient satisfaction and retention.  Providers can do better population health management by identifying appropriate intervention models for risk stratified population combining data from the in-facility care episodes and home based telehealth.&lt;!-- It's unclear how the definition of prescriptive analytics provides distinguishes itself from the well established area of EBM (evidence based medicine) --&gt;

Prescriptive analytics can also benefit healthcare providers in their capacity planning by using analytics to leverage operational and usage data combined with data of external factors such as economic data, population demographic trends and population health trends, to more accurately plan for future capital investments such as new facilities and equipment utilization as well as understand the trade-offs between adding additional beds and expanding an existing facility versus building a new one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foster, Roger|title=Big data and public health, part 2: Reducing Unwarranted Services|journal=Government Health IT|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescriptive analytics can help pharmaceutical companies to expedite their drug development by identifying patient cohorts that are most suitable for the clinical trials worldwide - patients who are expected to be compliant and will not drop out of the trial due to complications.  Analytics can tell companies how much time and money they can save if they choose one patient cohort in a specific country vs. another.

In provider-payer negotiations, [[Health care provider|providers]] can improve their negotiating position with health insurers by developing a robust understanding of future service utilization. By accurately predicting utilization, providers can also better allocate personnel.

{{Economics sidebar}}

The balanced growth theory is an [[economic theory]] pioneered by the economist [[Ragnar Nurkse]] (1907–1959). The theory hypothesises that the government of any underdeveloped country needs to make large investments in a number of industries simultaneously.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;&lt;ref name="godo"/&gt; This will enlarge the market size, increase productivity, and provide an incentive for the private sector to invest.

Nurkse was in favour of attaining balanced growth in both the industrial and agricultural sectors of the economy.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt; He recognised that the expansion and inter-sectoral balance between agriculture and manufacturing is necessary so that each of these sectors provides a market for the products of the other and in turn, supplies the necessary raw materials for the development and growth of the other.

Nurkse and [[Paul Rosenstein-Rodan]] were the pioneers of balanced growth theory and much of how it is understood today dates back to their work.&lt;ref name="handbook1"/&gt;

Nurkse's theory discusses how the poor size of the market in underdeveloped countries perpetuates its underdeveloped state.&lt;ref name="kd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="debraj"/&gt; Nurkse has also clarified the various determinants of the market size and puts primary focus on productivity.&lt;ref name = "case"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "mispuri"/&gt; According to him, if the productivity levels rise in a less developed country, its market size will expand and thus it can eventually become a developed economy. Apart from this, Nurkse has been nicknamed an export pessimist, as he feels that the finances to make investments in underdeveloped countries must arise from their own domestic territory.&lt;ref name = "james"/&gt; No importance should be given to promoting exports.&lt;ref name="working"/&gt;

== Size of market and inducement to invest ==

The size of a market assumes primary importance in the study of what induces investment in a country. Ragnar Nurkse referenced the work of [[Allyn A. Young]] to assert that inducement to invest is limited by the size of the market.&lt;ref name = "allyn"/&gt; The original idea behind this was put forward by [[Adam Smith]], who stated that [[division of labour]] (as against inducement to invest) is limited by the extent of the market.&lt;ref name = "mispuri"/&gt;

According to Nurkse, underdeveloped countries lack adequate [[purchasing power]].&lt;ref name = "mispuri"/&gt; ''Low purchasing power'' means that the [[real wage|real income]] of the people is low, although in monetary terms it may be high. If the money income were low, the problem could easily be overcome by expanding the [[money supply]]; however, since the meaning in this context is real income, expanding the supply of money will only generate [[inflationary]] pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic [[demand]] for commodities is low. Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for [[capital (economics)|capital]] as well.

The size of the market determines the incentive to invest irrespective of the nature of the economy.&lt;ref name="debraj"/&gt; This is because entrepreneurs invariably take their production decisions by taking into consideration the demand for the concerned product. For example, if an automobile manufacturer is trying to decide which countries to set up plants in, he will naturally only invest in those countries where the demand is high.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt; He would prefer to invest in a developed country, where though the population is lesser than in [[underdeveloped countries]], the people are prosperous and there is a definite demand.

Private entrepreneurs sometimes resort to heavy [[advertising]] as a means of attracting buyers for their products. Although this may lead to a rise in demand for that entrepreneur's good or service, it does not actually raise the [[aggregate demand]] in the economy. The demand merely shifts from one provider to another.&lt;ref name ="kd"/&gt; Clearly, this is not a long-term solution.

Ragnar Nurkse concluded,

{{quote|''"The limited size of the domestic market in a low income country can thus constitute an obstacle to the application of capital by any individual firm or industry working for the market. In this sense the small domestic market is an obstacle to development generally."''&lt;ref name = "case"/&gt; |}}

== Determinants of size of market ==
According to Nurkse, expanding the size of the market is crucial to increasing the inducement to invest. Only then can the vicious circle of poverty be broken. He mentioned the following pertinent points about how the size of the market is determined:

[[File:Determinants of Size of Market in Ragnar Nurkse's Balanced Growth Theory.svg|thumb|right|500px|450px|alt=Determinants of size of market|Determinants of size of market]]

=== Money supply ===
{{Main|Money supply}}

Nurkse emphasised that [[Keynesian theory]] shouldn't be applied to underdeveloped countries because they don't face a lack of [[effective demand]] in the way that [[developed countries]] do.&lt;ref name = "mispuri"/&gt; Their problem is to do with a lack of real [[purchasing power]] due to low productivity levels. Thus, merely increasing the supply of money will not expand the market but will in fact cause ''inflationary pressure''.

=== Population ===
Nurkse argued against the notion that a large population implies a large market.&lt;ref name="kd" /&gt; Though underdeveloped countries have a large population, their levels of productivity are low. This results in low levels of per capita real income. Thus, consumption expenditure is low, and savings are either very low or completely absent. On the other hand, developed countries have smaller populations than underdeveloped countries but by virtue of high levels of productivity, their per capita real incomes are higher and thus they create a large market for goods and services.

=== Geographical area ===
Nurkse also refuted the claim that if a country's geographical area is large, the size of its market also ought to be large.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt; A country may be extremely small in area but still have a large effective demand. For example, Japan. In contrast, a country may cover a huge geographical area but its market may still be small. This may occur if a large part of the country is uninhabitable, or if the country suffers from low productivity levels and thus has a low [[National Income]].

=== Transport cost and trade barriers ===
The notion that transport costs and trade barriers hinder the expansion of the market is age-old. Nurkse emphasised that [[tariff]] duties, exchange controls, [[import quotas]] and other [[non-tariff barriers to trade]] are major obstacles to promoting international cooperation in exporting and importing.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt; More specifically, due to high transport costs between nations, producers do not have an incentive to export their commodities. As a result, the amount of [[capital accumulation]] remains small. To address this problem, the United Nations produced a report in 1951&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Measures for the Economic Development of Underdeveloped Countries, Report by a Group of Experts appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations|date=May 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; with solutions for underdeveloped countries. They suggested that they can expand their markets by forming customs unions with neighbouring countries. Also, they can adopt the system of preferential taxation or even abolish customs duties altogether. The logic was that once customs duties are removed, transport costs will fall. Consequently, prices will fall and thus the demand will rise. However, Nurkse, as an export pessimist, did not agree with this view.&lt;ref name="working"/&gt; Export pessimism is a trade theory which is governed by the idea of "inward looking growth" as opposed to "outward looking growth". (See [[Import substitution industrialization]])

=== Sales promotion ===
Often, it is true that a company's private endeavour to increase the demand for its products succeeds due to the extensive use of advertisement and other sales promotion technique. However, Nurkse argues that such activities cannot succeed at the macro level to increase a country's aggregate demand level.&lt;ref name = "mispuri"/&gt; He calls this the ''"macroeconomic paradox"''.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt;

=== Productivity ===
{{Main|Productivity}}

Nurkse stressed productivity as the ''primary determinant of the size of the market''. An increase in productivity (defined as the output per unit input) increases the flow of goods and services in the economy. As a response, consumption also rises. Hence, underdeveloped economies should aim to raise their productivity levels in all sectors of the economy, in particular agriculture and industry.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt;

[[File:How increased productivity leads to economic development and growth.svg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Productivity|The process of how increased productivity leads to economic development and growth]]

For example, in most underdeveloped economies, the ''technology'' used to carry out agricultural activities is backward. There is a low degree of mechanisation coupled with rain dependence. So while a large proportion of the population (70-80%) may be actively employed in the agriculture sector, the contribution to the Gross Domestic Product may be as low as 40%.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt; This points to the need to increase output per unit input and ''output per head''. This can be done if the government provides irrigation facilities, [[high-yielding variety]] seeds, pesticides, fertilisers, tractors etc. The positive outcome of this is that farmers earn more income and have a higher purchasing power (real income). Their demand for other products in the economy will rise and this will provide industrialists an incentive to invest in that country. Thus, the size of the market expands and improves the condition of the underdeveloped country.

Nurkse is of the opinion that [[Say's Law]] of markets operates in underdeveloped countries. Thus, if the money incomes of the people rise while the price level in the economy stays the same, the size of the market will still not expand till the real income and productivity levels rise. To quote Nurkse,

{{quote|''"In underdeveloped areas there is generally no '[[deflationary gap]]' through excessive savings. Production creates its own demand, and the size of the market depends on the volume of production. In the last analysis, the market can be enlarged only through all-round increase in productivity. Capacity to buy means capacity to produce."''&lt;ref name="case"/&gt;|}}
{{Clear}}

== Export pessimism ==
Citing the limited size of the market as the main impediment in economic growth, Nurkse reasons that an increase in productivity can create a [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|virtuous circle of growth]].&lt;ref name = "mispuri"/&gt; Thus, a large scale investment programme in a wide array of industries simultaneously is the answer. The increase in demand for one industry will lead to an increase in demand for another industry due to ''complementarity of demands''. As Say's Law states, ''supply creates its own demand''.&lt;ref name="gulati"/&gt;

However, Nurkse clarified that the finance for this development must arise to as large an extent as possible from the underdeveloped country itself i.e. domestically.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt; He stated that financing through increased trade or [[foreign investments]] was a strategy used in the past - the 19th century - and its success was limited to the case of the United States of America. In reality, the so-called "new countries" of the United States of America (which separated from the British empire) were high income countries to begin with.&lt;ref name="working"/&gt; They were already endowed with efficient producers, effective markets and a high purchasing power. The point Nurkse was trying to make was that USA was rich in resource endowment as well as labour force. The labour force had merely migrated from Britain to USA, and thus their level of skills were advanced to begin with. This situation of outward led growth was therefore unique and not replicable by underdeveloped countries.

In fact, if such a strategy of financing development from outside the home country is undertaken, it creates a number of problems.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt; For example, the foreign investors may carelessly misuse the resources of the underdeveloped country. This would in turn limit that economy's ability to diversify, especially if natural resources were plundered. This may also create a distorted social structure.&lt;ref name="working"/&gt; Apart from this, there is also a risk that the foreign investments may be used to finance private luxury consumption. People would try to imitate Western consumption habits and thus a [[balance of payments crisis]] may develop, along with economic inequality within the population.

Another reason exports cannot be promoted is because in all likelihood, an underdeveloped country may only be skilled enough to promote the export of primary goods, say agricultural goods.&lt;ref name = "mispuri"/&gt; However, since such commodities face [[inelastic demand]], the extent to which they will sell in the market is limited.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt; Although when population is at a rise, additional demand for exports may be created, Nurkse implicitly assumed that developed countries are operating at the [[replacement rate]] of population growth. For Nurkse, then, exports as a means of economic development are completely ruled out.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;

Thus, for a large-scale development to be feasible, the requisite capital must be generated from within the country itself, and not through export surplus or foreign investment.&lt;ref name="debraj"/&gt;&lt;ref name="social"/&gt; Only then can productivity increase and lead to increasing returns to scale and eventually create virtuous circles of growth.&lt;ref name="working"/&gt;&lt;ref name="social"/&gt;

== Role of state ==
After [[World War II]], a debate about whether a country should introduce ''[[financial planning]]'' to develop itself or rely on ''private entrepreneurs'' emerged. Nurkse believed that the subject of who ''should'' promote development does not concern economists. It is an administrative problem.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt; The crucial idea was that a large amount of well dispersed investment should be made in the economy, so that the market size expands and leads to higher productivity levels, increasing returns to scale and eventually the development of the country in question.&lt;ref name = "mispuri"/&gt; However, it should be noted that most economists who favoured the balanced growth hypothesis believed that only the state has the capacity to take on the kind of heavy investments the theory propagates. Further, the gestation period of such lumpy investments is usually long and private sector entrepreneurs do not normally undertake such high risks.&lt;ref name="kd"/&gt;

== Reactions ==
Ragnar Nurkse's balanced growth theory too has been criticised on a number of grounds. His main critic was [[Albert O. Hirschman]], the pioneer of the [[strategy of unbalanced growth]]. [[Hans W. Singer]] also criticised certain aspects of the theory.

Hirschman stressed the fact that underdeveloped economies are called underdeveloped because they face a ''lack of resources'', maybe not natural resources, but resources such as skilled labour and technology.&lt;ref name = "mispuri"/&gt; Thus, to hypothesise that an underdeveloped nation can undertake large scale investment in many industries of its economy simultaneously is unrealistic due to the paucity of resources.&lt;ref name="hirsch"/&gt; To quote Hirschman,

{{quote|''"If a country were ready to apply the doctrine of balanced growth, then it would not be underdeveloped in the first place."''&lt;ref name="hirsch"/&gt;|}}

Hans Singer asserted that the balanced growth theory is more applicable to cure an economy facing a [[business cycle|cyclical]] downswing.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt; Cyclical downswing is a feature of an advanced stage of sustained growth rather than of the [[vicious cycle of poverty]].
Hirschman also stated that during conditions of slack activity in developed countries, the stock of resources, machines and entrepreneurs are merely unemployed, and are present as idle capacity. So in this situation, simultaneous investment in a large number of sectors is a well-suited policy. The various economic agents are temporarily unemployed and once the inducement to invest starts operating, the slump will be overcome. However, for an underdeveloped economy, where such resources are absent, this principle doesn't fit.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt;

Another contention was Nurkse's approval of [[Say's Law]], which theorises that there is no [[overproduction]] or glut in the economy.&lt;ref name="gulati"/&gt; Supply (production of goods and services) creates a matching demand for the output and this results in the entire output being sold and consumed. However, Keynes stated that Say's Law is not operational in any country because people do not spend their entire income - a fraction of it is saved for future consumption.&lt;ref name="gulati"/&gt; Thus, according to Nurkse's critics, his assumption of Say's Law being operational in underdeveloped countries needs greater justification.&lt;ref name = "mispuri"/&gt; Even if the section of savers is few, the  tenet of  putting emphasis on supply rather than demand has been widely discredited.&lt;ref name="gulati"/&gt;&lt;ref name="anderson"/&gt;

Nurkse states that if demand for the output of one sector rises, due to the complementary nature of demand, the demand for the output of other industries will also experience a rise.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt; Paul Rosenstein-Rodan spoke of a similar concept called "indivisibility of demand" which hypothesises that if large investments are made in a large number of industries simultaneously, an underdeveloped economy can become developed due to the phenomenon of complementary demand.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt; However, both Nurkse and Rosenstein-Rodan only took into consideration the situation of industries that produce [[complementary goods]].&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt; There are [[substitute good]]s too, which are in competition with each other. Thus if the state pumps in large investments into the car industry, for example, it will naturally lead to a rise in the demand for petrol. But if the state makes large scale investments in the coffee sector of a country, the tea sector will suffer.

Hans Singer suggested that Nurkse's theory makes dubious assumptions about the underdeveloped economy.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt; For example, Nurkse assumes that the economy starts with nothing at hand.&lt;ref name="kd"/&gt; However, an economy usually starts at a position which reflects the previous investment decisions undertaken in the country,&lt;ref name = "mispuri"/&gt; and at any given moment, an imbalance already exists. So the logical step would be to take on those investment programmes which compliment the existing imbalance in the economy. Clearly, such an investment cannot be a balanced one. If an economy makes the mistake of setting out to make a balanced investment, a new imbalance is likely to appear which will require still another "balancing investment" to bring equilibrium, and so on and so forth.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt;

Hirschman believed that Nurkse's balanced growth theory wasn't in fact a theory of growth.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt; Growth implies the gradual transformation of an economy from one stage to the chronologically next stage. It entails the series of actions which leads the economy from a stage of infancy to that of maturity.&lt;ref name="mispuri"/&gt; However, the balanced growth theory involves the creation of a brand new, self-sufficient modern industrial economy being laid over a stagnant, self-sufficient traditional economy. Thus, there is no transformation.&lt;ref name="hirsch"/&gt; In reality, a [[dual economy]] will come into existence, where two separate economic sectors will begin to coexist in one country. They will differ on levels of development, technology and demand patterns. This may create inequality in the country.&lt;ref name="hirsch"/&gt;

[[File:Vatican-ChapelleSixtine-Plafond.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A post-restoration section of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel that includes the fresco shown above]]

The '''conservation-restoration of the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel''' was one of the most significant [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation-restorations]] of the 20th century.

The [[Sistine Chapel]] was built by [[Pope Sixtus IV]] within the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]] immediately to the north of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] and completed in about 1481. Its walls were decorated by a number of [[Italian Renaissance painting|Renaissance painters]] who were among the most highly regarded artists of late 15th century Italy, including [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], and [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]].&lt;ref name=JS/&gt; The Chapel was further enhanced under [[Pope Julius II]] by the painting of [[Sistine Chapel ceiling|the ceiling]] by [[Michelangelo]] between 1508 and 1512 and by the painting of the ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|Last Judgment]]'', commissioned by [[Pope Clement VII]] and completed in 1541, again by Michelangelo.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Giacometti, editor, ''The Sistine Chapel'', (1986) Harmony Books, {{ISBN|0-517-56274-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tapestry|tapestries]] on the lowest tier, today best known from the [[Raphael Cartoons]] (painted designs) of 1515–16, completed the ensemble.

Together the paintings make up the greatest pictorial scheme of the Renaissance. Individually, some of Michelangelo's paintings on the ceiling are among the most notable works of western art ever created.{{ref label|a|a|none}} The [[fresco]]es of the Sistine Chapel and in particular the ceiling and accompanying [[lunette]]s by Michelangelo have been subject to a number of restorations, the most recent taking place between 1980 and 1994. This most recent restoration had a profound effect on art lovers and historians, as colours and details that had not been seen for centuries were revealed. It has been claimed that as a result "Every book on Michelangelo will have to be rewritten".&lt;ref&gt;University of Victoria art scholar, John Osborne, in the ''Queen's Quarterly'', as quoted in: {{cite news | first=Fulford| last=Robert| title =Robert Fulford's column about art restoration in Italy | work =[[The Globe and Mail]] | date=11 February 1998 | url =http://www.robertfulford.com/restore.html | accessdate = 2011-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as the art historian [[James Beck (art historian)|James Beck]] of [[ArtWatch International]], have been extremely critical of the restoration, saying that the restorers have not realised the true intentions of the artist. This is the subject of continuing debate.

==Previous restorations==
The frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel had a number of interventions prior to the restoration process which was started in 1980&lt;!--doesn't make sense in the context of the rest of the article otherwise--&gt;. Initial problems with the ceiling appear to have been caused by water penetrating through the floor above. In about 1547 [[Paolo Giovio]] wrote that the ceiling was being damaged by [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]] and cracks. The effect of saltpetre is to leave a white [[efflorescence]].  Gianluigi Colalucci, Head Restorer at the Laboratory for the Restoration of Paintings for Papal Monuments, Museums and Galleries, states in his essay ''Michelangelo's colours rediscovered'',&lt;ref name=GC/&gt; that the early conservators treated this cosmetically by an application of [[linseed oil|linseed]] or [[walnut oil]] which had the effect of making the crystalline deposit more transparent.

In 1625, a restoration was carried out by Simone Lagi, the "resident gilder",  who wiped the ceiling with linen cloths and cleaned it by rubbing it with bread. He occasionally resorted to wetting the bread to remove the more stubborn accretions. His report states that the [[fresco]]es "were returned to their previous beauty without receiving any harm".&lt;ref&gt;[[Vatican Library]], Vat. Capponiano 231, f 238 and Chigiano  G. III 66. f 108.  as cited by Colalucci&lt;/ref&gt; Colalucci states that Lagi "almost certainly" applied layers of  glue-varnish to revive the colours but does not state this in his report in the interests of "preserving the secrets of their [the restorers'] craft".&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

Between 1710 and 1713 a further restoration was carried out by the painter [[Annibale Mazzuoli]] and his son. They used sponges dipped in Greek wine which Colalucci suggests was necessitated by the accretion of grime caused by soot and dirt trapped in the oily deposits of the previous restoration. Mazzuoli then worked over the ceiling, according to Colalucci, strengthening the contrasts by overpainting details. They also repainted some areas the colours of which were lost because of the efflorescence of salts. Areas of repainting were hatched or treated with a linear brushstroke.{{ref label|b|b|none}} Colalucci states that Mazzuoli also applied a great deal of glue varnish. The restoration concentrated on the ceiling and less attention was paid to the [[lunette]]s.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

The penultimate restoration was undertaken by the Restoration Laboratory of the [[Vatican Museum]] between 1935 and 1938. The scope of the work was to consolidate some areas of the [[intonaco]] at the eastern end of the building and partially remove the soot and dirt.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

==Modern restoration==
[[File:Michelangelo Buonarroti 014.jpg|thumb|200px|The Sistine Chapel before the restoration. {{ref label|c|c|none}}]]
The preliminary experimentation for the modern restoration began in 1979. The restoration team comprised Gianluigi Colalucci, Maurizio Rossi, Piergiorgio Bonetti, and others,&lt;ref name=CP/&gt; who took as their guidelines the ''Rules for restoration of works of art'' as established in 1978 by Carlo Pietrangeli, director of the Vatican's Laboratory for the Restoration of Pictures, which govern the procedure and methods employed in restoration. An important part of modern restoration procedure, as established by these rules, is the study and analysis of the artwork.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt; Part of this was the recording of every stage of the restoration process. This was done by the photographer [[Takashi Okamura (photographer)|Takashi Okamura]] for [[Nippon Television Network Corporation]].&lt;ref name=FM/&gt;

Between June 1980 and October 1984 the first stage of restoration, the work upon Michelangelo's lunettes, was achieved. The focus of the work then transferred to the ceiling, which was completed in December 1989 and from there to the [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|Last Judgment]]. The restoration was unveiled by [[Pope John Paul II]] on 8 April 1994.&lt;ref name=jp94&gt;{{cite web

===Aims of the conservators===
The aims of the conservators were as follows:

* To study the frescoes progressively, to analyse any discoveries and utilise the appropriate technical responses.
* To record every step of the operation in archival reports, photographs and film.
* To use only those procedures and materials which were simple, extensively tested, not harmful, and reversible.
* To repair cracks and structural damage that threatened the stability of the plaster.
* To remove layers of grime consisting of candle wax and soot that had been deposited by the burning of candles in the chapel for 500 years.
* To remove repainting by previous restorers that attempted to counteract the effects of soot and other accretions.
* To remove oil and animal fat used to counteract salination of areas where water had leaked through.
* To remove crystalline accretions of salt that had whitened areas where water had leaked through.
* To conserve surfaces that were in danger of further deterioration because of bubbling, and flaking.
* To restore sympathetically those areas where deterioration of one sort or another had obliterated details and caused loss of integrity to the whole, for example, filling a bad crack and painting the plaster in a colour matching the original.
* To maintain in small defined areas a physical historical record of the previous restorations that had taken place.

In 1979 Colalucci undertook a series of experiments to discover the right approach for the restoration of the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel. The investigation began by testing small areas of the wall fresco, ''Conflict over the Body of [[Moses]]'' by [[Matteo de Lecce]], which had similar physical and chemical attributes to the painting techniques employed on Michelangelo's frescoes. Trials to find the right solvents were continued on a small portion of the Eleazar and Matthan lunette.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

Because of the height of the ceiling and the inaccessibility of the ceiling frescoes, the precise nature of the damage and the problems that would be encountered by the restoration team could not be entirely foreseen until after the decision to restore was taken, and the scaffolding was in place. According to Colalucci, the continued scientific analysis and the response of the restorers to the particular problems was an ongoing part of the process, rather than the conservation team deciding on a single treatment for every part of the building.&lt;ref name=GC&gt;Gianluigi Colalucci's essay, ''Michelangelo's Colours Rediscovered'' in ''The Sistine Chapel'', ed. Massimo Giacometti. (1986) Harmony Books, {{ISBN|0-517-56274-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 the decision to undertake a total restoration was taken&lt;!--if you know who took it some of the passive voice can go--&gt;. [[Nippon Television Network Corporation]] of Japan provided major funding of US$4.2 million in exchange for the filming rights.

===Scaffold===
The team of restorers completed the first stage of the restoration, on the vertical surfaces and curved [[spandrel]]s around the upper sections of the windows, from [[aluminium]] [[scaffolding]] projecting from just below the lunettes and using the same holes in the wall that had been made for Michelangelo's scaffold. When they moved to the ceiling, they likewise employed a system similar to Michelangelo's, which involved [[cantilever]]ing a shelf outwards from the scaffolding to support a stepped and arched platform. The advantages of modern lightweight materials meant that the platform could be wheeled, facilitating easy movement along the length of the building rather than dismantling and replacement, as Michelangelo had done in 1506.&lt;ref name=FM&gt;Fabrizio Mancinelli's essay, ''Michelangelo at Work'' in ''The Sistine Chapel'', ed. Massimo Giacometti, (1986) Harmony Books, {{ISBN|0-517-56274-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pietrangeli, Hirst and Colalucci, eds. ''The Sistine Chapel: A Glorious Restoration'', (1994) Harry N Abrams, {{ISBN|0-8109-8176-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State of the frescoes===
The findings of the investigation of 1979 were that the entire interior of the chapel, but particularly the ceiling, was covered with a grime of candle smoke comprising [[wax]] and [[soot]] ([[amorphous carbon]]). Above the windows (the main source of ventilation), the lunettes were particularly stained from the smoke and exhaust fumes of the city, being "much dirtier than the ceiling proper".&lt;ref name=FM/&gt;
The building was a little unstable and had already shifted considerably prior to Michelangelo's work of 1508, causing cracking of the ceiling, the crack in the "Judith" [[pendentive]] being so large that it had to be filled with bricks and mortar before painting. The upper part of the ceiling provided Michelangelo an irregular surface due to cracks and water seepage.&lt;ref name=JS&gt;[[John Shearman]], essay ''The Chapel of Sixtus IV'' in ''The Sistine Chapel'', ed. Massimo Giacometti, (1986) Harmony Books, {{ISBN|0-517-56274-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued ingress of water from the roof and from unroofed exterior walkways above the ceiling level had caused seepage which carried down salts from the building mortar and deposited them on the ceiling through evaporation. In places this caused the surface of the frescoes to bubble and lift. Although discolouration was a serious problem, bubbling was not, because the thinness and transparency of the paint which Michelangelo employed on the greater part of the ceiling permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

Earlier restorations had all left their marks on the frescoes. To counteract the whitening caused by salination, animal fat and vegetable oil had been applied, which effectively made the salt crystals transparent, but left a sticky layer that accumulated dirt. An additional problem, most obvious in the small [[putti]] which hold the nameplates on the pendentives, was [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]] seeping through small cracks and appearing as dark rings on the surface. Unlike the white crystalline salt deposits, this could not be removed and the staining was irreversible. Layers of varnish and glue had been applied to many areas. This had darkened and become opaque. Restorers had repainted details over the darkened areas in order to define the features of figures. This was particularly the case for the lunettes, spandrels and lower parts of the pendentives.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

Close examination revealed that apart from smoky deposits, seepage deposits and structural cracks, the thin "pictorial skin" of Michelangelo's frescoes was in excellent condition.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt; Colalucci describes Michelangelo as having employed the best possible fresco techniques, as described by [[Vasari]].&lt;ref&gt;Milanesi ed. Vasari, ''Vite...'' Book I, Chapter V, p.182, ed. Milanesi, Florence (1906), as cited by Colalucci.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the paint was well adhered and required little retouching. The plaster, or [[intonaco]], on which the paintings were executed was found, for the most part, to be secure, as previous restorers had fixed it in places with [[bronze]] pins.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

===Interventions===
Prior to the restoration the team spent six months investigating the composition and condition of the frescoes, questioning members of the team that had restored the frescoes in the 1930s and making a detailed scientific study to ascertain which solvents and methods were best employed upon particular painted surfaces.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;
[[File:Gardenbeforeandafter.jpg|thumb|left|350px|A composite image of ''The Fall and Expulsion of Adam and Eve'' by [[Michelangelo]]. The upper left is shown unrestored, the lower right is shown restored.]]
The first stage of the physical restoration was to re-attach any areas of the plaster surface (which was approximately 5&amp;nbsp;mm thick) that were in danger of separating and breaking away. This was done by injecting a [[polyvinylacetate]] [[resin]]. Earlier bronze braces that had been used to stabilise surfaces were removed in those places where they were causing cracking, and the holes filled. Pigments that appeared to be not well adhered were consolidated with the application of diluted acrylic resin.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

The restorers washed the surfaces using a variety of solvents. Distilled water was used wherever possible to remove soot and dissolve water-soluble gums. Retouching and repainting that had been part of previous later restorations were removed with a gelatinous solvent, applied in several stages for measured times, and washed with distilled water. Salt efflorescences of [[calcium carbonate]] were treated by the application of a solution of [[dimethylformamide]]. The final step was the application of a weak solution of [[acryl group|acrylic]] [[polymer]] to consolidate and protect the surface, and further washing.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;

Where necessary some areas were retouched in [[watercolor painting|watercolour]], to integrate the pictorial material. These areas are distinctively textured with vertical brushstrokes, not visible from a distance but easily discernible as restoration work when viewed close up.&lt;ref name=GC /&gt;

Certain small areas were left unrestored, in order to maintain a physical record of the previous restorations that had taken place, for example, an area left with overpainting and candle wax, and another area demonstrating the attempt to counteract salination with oil.

==Environmental protection of the frescoes==
Once the many layers of candle wax, varnish, and animal glue were removed from the surface of the Sistine Chapel frescoes, they became subject to dangers that could not have been predicted by previous restorers.

One of the major dangers to the frescoes is [[exhaust fumes|automotive exhaust]], and they are also vulnerable to the effects of the crowds of tourists that pass through the chapel every day, bringing with them heat, humidity, dust and [[bacteria]] (the latter of which can biodegrade paints and pigments).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ciferri|first=Orio|date=1999-03-01|title=Microbial Degradation of Paintings | journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|volume=65|issue=3|pages=879–885|issn=0099-2240|pmc=91117|pmid=10049836}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clean plaster surfaces are more in danger from these destructive elements than they were when they were covered with a layer of smoky wax.&lt;ref name="Carrier"&gt;Carrier, United Technologies, ''Sistine Chapel'', [http://search.atomz.com/search/?sp_i=1&amp;sp_q=Sistine+Chapel&amp;sp_a=sp100368b9&amp;sp_k=global&amp;sp_p=any&amp;sp_f=utf-8&amp;x=11&amp;y=9] Retrieved on 2007-09-28. NOTE: This page is no longer available.&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the Sistine Chapel's only [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] was from its windows in the upper level of the walls. To prevent exhaust fumes and wind-blown [[Air pollution|pollutants]] from entering, the windows are now permanently closed and an [[air conditioning]] system has been installed. The installation is by Carrier of the [[United Technologies Corporation]] and was developed with the cooperation of the [[Roman Curia|Vatican]]'s Office of Technical Services. It has been designed to counteract the various problems specific to the Chapel, in particular the rapid changes of heat and [[humidity]] that occur with the admission of the first crowds of tourists each morning and the departure of the last visitors each afternoon. The air conditioning varies not only the heat but also the relative humidity between the summer and winter months so that changes to the atmospheric environment occur gradually. The air near the ceiling is kept at a temperate level, while the air in the lower section of the building is cooler and circulates more rapidly, with the effect that dirt particles fall towards the floor rather than being streamed upwards. [[Bacteria]] and chemical [[pollutant]]s are filtered out.

Environmental specifications:&lt;ref name= Carrier /&gt;
* [[Air filtration]] units: remove particles down to 0.1 micrometre
* [[Air temperature]]: {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}} in summer, moving gradually to {{convert|25|°C|0|abbr=on}} in winter.
* [[Relative humidity]] at ceiling: 55% ±5%.
* [[Sensor]]s: 92, of which about half are for back-up purposes.
* [[Wiring]]: 26&amp;nbsp;km (85,000&amp;nbsp;ft)

==Response to the restoration==

===Criticism and praise===
When the restoration of the Sistine Chapel was announced, it sparked a barrage of queries and objections from art historians around the world. One of the most vocal of these critics was [[James Beck (art historian)|James Beck]], of [[ArtWatch International]], who issued repeated warnings about the possibility of damage to Michelangelo's work from over-strenuous restoration. An argument that was used repeatedly was that all the previous interventions had caused damage of one sort or another. Any restoration, as opposed to conservation, puts an artwork at risk. Conservation, on the other hand, aids in the preservation of the work in its present state and in prevention of further deterioration. Beck has written about his concerns in ''Art Restoration, the Culture, the Business and the Scandal.''&lt;ref&gt;James Beck and Michael Daley, ''Art Restoration, the Culture, the Business and the Scandal'', W.W. Norton, 1995. {{ISBN|0-393-31297-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Michelangelo Buonarroti 027.jpg|thumb|''[[Jeremiah]] lamenting the destruction of Jerusalem''.]]
{{quote|In the rhetoric of this conversation, [the conservators] say that the previous restoration was no good&amp;nbsp;– now we're going to make a really good one. It's like having a facelift. How many times can people go through one without their poor faces looking like an orange peel?|source=[[James Beck (art historian)|James Beck]]&lt;ref name= OAM&gt;{{cite journal | last =Ohlson | first =Kristin | title =Conservation Wars | journal =Oberlin Alumni Magazine | volume =98 | issue =2 | pages = | date =Fall 2002 | url =http://www.oberlin.edu/alummag/oamcurrent/oam_fall2002/main_conservation_3.htm | accessdate =  2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While James Beck became "embroiled in a public debate" with Gianluigi Colalucci, Ronald Feldman, a New York art dealer, started a petition supported by 15 well-known artists including [[Robert Motherwell]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Christo]] and [[Andy Warhol]] asking Pope John Paul II to call a halt to the procedure and also the restoration of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|Last Supper]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Glueck, ''Halt Urged in Work on Sistine and "Last Supper"'', ''New York Times'', 1987-03-06 [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DF1F39F935A35750C0A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print]. Retrieved 2007-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

An undertaking of the restoration team was that everything would be handled in a transparent fashion, that reporters, art historians and others with a bona fide interest should have ready access to information and to view the work. However, a single company, [[Nippon Television Network Corporation]], had sole photography rights. Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote, in 1991, that the criticism of the restoration of the ceiling and lunettes was in part fuelled by the Nippon Television Network's reluctance to make public those photographs that they had taken by exclusive right, which had recorded every stage of the process and which were the only solid evidence that the work was being done appropriately.

According to Kimmelman, the reason for their reluctance to produce the detailed photos, which could have put to rest the worst fears of many of the interested parties, was the intention of the company to produce a large limited-edition two-volume coffee-table book ("as large as a coffee table"). This book, when produced&lt;!--when?--&gt; retailed for US$1,000. Kimmelman refers to the fact that these photos were only made available to the few who could afford the exorbitant price as "ungenerous" and "immoral".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

As the work was progressively completed, there were those who were delighted; [[Pope John Paul II]] spoke an inaugural [[homily]] after each stage. In December 1999, after the completion of the wall frescoes, he said:

{{quote|It would be difficult to find a more eloquent visual commentary on this biblical image than the Sistine Chapel, whose full splendour we can enjoy today thanks to the recently completed restoration. Our joy is shared by the faithful throughout the world, who not only cherish this place because of the masterpieces it contains, but also for the role it plays in the Church's life.|Pope John Paul II&lt;ref name=jp99/&gt;}}

Cardinal [[Edmund Szoka]], governor of [[Vatican City]], said: "This restoration and the expertise of the restorers allows us to contemplate the paintings as if we had been given the chance of being present when they were first shown."&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, ''Sistine Chapel Restored'' 1999-12-11, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/560315.stm]. Retrieved 2007-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers were less flattering. Andrew Wordsworth of ''[[The Independent]]'', London, expressed the major point of concern:

{{quote|There seems little doubt that the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel was in part painted [[fresco-secco|a secco]] (that is, once the plaster was dry), but the restorers none the less decided that radical cleaning was necessary, given the amount of dirt that had accumulated (in particular from candle smoke).

This crucial matter was also emphasised by Beck and defined in very clearly expressed terms on the website of the artist, Peter Layne Arguimbau.&lt;ref name= PLA&gt;{{cite web

===Issues raised by critics===
That part of the restoration in the Sistine Chapel which has caused the most concern is the ceiling, painted by [[Michelangelo]]. The emergence of the brightly coloured [[Ancestors of Christ]] from the gloom sparked a reaction of fear that the processes being employed in the cleaning were too severe. Despite warnings, the work on the ceiling proceeded and, according to critics such as James Beck, their worst fears were confirmed once the ceiling was completed.&lt;ref name= PLA /&gt;&lt;ref name= Beck&gt;{{cite web

The cause for dissent lies in the analysis and understanding of the techniques utilised by Michelangelo, and the technical response of the restorers to their understanding of those techniques. A close examination of the frescoes of the lunettes convinced the restorers that Michelangelo worked exclusively in "[[buon fresco]]"; that is, the artist worked only on freshly laid plaster and each section of work was completed while the plaster was still in its fresh state. In other words, Michelangelo did not work "a secco"; he did not come back later and add details onto the dry plaster.&lt;ref&gt;See reference to Colalucci's conflicting report.&lt;/ref&gt;

The restorers, by assuming that the artist took a universal approach to the painting, took a universal approach to the restoration. A decision was made that all of the shadowy layer of animal glue and "lamp black", all of the wax, and all of the overpainted areas were contamination of one sort or another: smoke deposits, earlier restoration attempts and painted definition by later restorers in attempt to enliven the appearance of the work. Based on this decision, according to Arguimbau's critical reading of the restoration data that has been provided, the chemists of the restoration team decided upon a solvent that would effectively strip the ceiling down to its paint-impregnated plaster. After treatment, only that which was painted "buon fresco" would remain.&lt;ref name= PLA /&gt;

[[File:Sistine Chapel Daniel beforandafter.jpg|upright=2|centre|thumb|{{centre|''Daniel'', before and after restoration.}}]]

According to critics, the inherent problem with this approach is that it relied heavily upon an assumption that Michelangelo only painted ''buon fresco'', that he was always satisfied with the result at the end of the day, and that in four and a half years spent on the ceiling, he stuck exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details. Arguimbau, on his website, quotes Colalucci, the head of the team, as contradicting himself on this matter.

A summary of the relevant statements of Colalucci, in the order that they occur in the Appendix entitled ''Michelangelo's colours uncovered'' is as follows:

{{quote|The elderly restorers who had taken part in the restoration of the 1930s were interviewed as part of the preparatory process. They claimed that Michelangelo worked over the frescoes ''a secco'' using ''velature'' or glazes as a binder. Colalucci rejects this, stating that Michelangelo worked exclusively in ''buon fresco''. Colalucci then contradicts this by stating that Michelangelo had worked ''a secco'', but "to a minimal degree" and "not at all in the lunettes".

Colalucci then talks of Michelangelo's "rigorous maintenance" of ''buon fresco'' technique, contradicting this by describing the ''a secco'' retouchings that Michelangelo made to the shoulder of Eleazar and the foot of Reboam, both of which are in the lunettes. He then says that Michelangelo worked in ''buon fresco'' with "no ''pentimenti'' proper", ([[pentimenti]] means the changes) but only small corrections in fresco.&lt;ref name=GC/&gt;}}

The ongoing criticism has been that the restorers presumed to know what end result the master was seeking to achieve in every separate case across the ceiling, and by what method he sought to achieve it. The disagreements about this have been vociferous and are unresolved.&lt;ref name=PLA/&gt;&lt;ref name= Beck/&gt;

====Carbon black problem====
The restorers took for granted that all of the layers of grease and soot on the ceiling were the result of candle smoke. Contrary to this view, James Beck and numerous artists have suggested that Michelangelo used [[carbon black]] in a wash of glue to lay on shadows and crisp dark definition, ''a secco''. If this is the case, then the greater part was removed in the restoration.&lt;ref&gt;Colalucci refers to this opinion in his Appendix quoted above&lt;/ref&gt;

On some of the figures, however, there still remains clear evidence of painting in carbon black. The apparent explanation for this is that over the long period that Michelangelo was at work, he probably, for a variety of reasons, varied his technique. Things that might affect the degree of finish achieved on a particular ''giornata'' include the heat and humidity of the day and the length of daylight hours. Whatever the reason for the difference is, a difference in approach to the light and shade on the individual figures is clearly apparent.

There are still intense areas of shadow which throw the [[Cumaean Sibyl]] into relief. But it is more than relief; it is the three-dimensionality which art-lovers expect to see in the work of the man who sculpted Moses.&lt;ref name=Beck/&gt; Critics of the restoration claim that this was Michelangelo's aim and that many frescoes had brightly contrasting colours laid side-by-side that were then worked over ''a secco'' to achieve this effect and that this is what has been lost by a too-scrupulous cleaning.&lt;ref name= PLA/&gt;

Consistently missing from the restored ceiling is the crisp ''a secco'' detailing of the architecture: the [[scallop]] shells, [[acorn]]s and "bead and reel" ornament which Michelangelo possibly would have left for completion by an assistant, when he moved on to the next panel. The treatment of these details varied considerably. In a few places, around the Ezekias spandrel, for example, the architectural detailing was painted ''buon fresco'' and remains intact.
[[File:Sistine Chapel TwoSpandrels.jpg|thumb|upright=2.4|centre|alt=A comparison of two spandrels reveals different post-restoration states.|Different post-restoration states in two similar spandrels. In the left spandrel, black detailing of robes, eyes and architecture is intact. In the right spandrel, these details have been lost in the cleaning.]]

A comparison of two spandrels reveals different post-restoration states. The one on the left has shadows and details defined in black. The green robe with yellow highlights has been washed with black and defined with deep shadow. On the [[fictive architecture]] each motif is picked out in black. The eyes of the child are detailed in black and white. The continued presence of these details suggests that they were completed while the plaster was damp. The entire right spandrel has an unfinished look. Before cleaning it also had black defining the shadows of the robes and crisp detailing on the architecture.

On the corner pendentives, each of which depicts a violent subject, the removal of the carbon black has diminished the dramatic intensity of all four scenes. This is particularly noticeable in the loss of depth in the ''Punishment of [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]]''. Where once the figure projected starkly against the darkly shadowed interior, now foreshortening, definition and drama is lost in the pastel monotone that remains.&lt;!--are the restorers admitting all this? Seems a little unbalanced in favour of the critics--&gt;

====Colour====
The curator, Fabrizio Mancinelli, quotes the 18th-century French traveller [[Jérôme Lalande|De Lalande]] in saying that the colouring of the ceiling was, by that time, monotonous, "tend[ing] towards dull red and grey". Mancinelli writes that the restoration reveals "a new Michelangelo" as a colourist and that this "new character makes much better sense of his historical position".&lt;ref name=FM/&gt; He goes on to say that perceptive viewers of the Sistine Chapel ceiling have always been aware that the range of colours used was very different from that which could be seen,&lt;ref&gt;Fabrizio Mancinelli, in the essay "Michelangelo at Work" (''The Sistine Chapel'', ed. Giacometti) cites Wilson, Biagetti and Wilde.&lt;/ref&gt; and included the same pinks, apple greens, oranges, yellows and pale blues that were employed by Michelangelo's teacher, [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], one of the most competent fresco painters of the Renaissance.

The brilliant palette ought to have been expected by the restorers as the same range of colours appears in the works of [[Giotto]], [[Masaccio]] and [[Masolino]], [[Fra Angelico]] and [[Piero della Francesca]], as well as Ghirlandaio himself and later fresco painters such as [[Annibale Carracci]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]]. The reason for employing this range of colours is that many other pigments are not usable in fresco as they have chemical properties that react badly in interaction with wet plaster.  The colour that is noticeably missing from Michelangelo's ceiling, but not ''The Last Judgment'', is the intense blue of [[lapis lazuli]]. This colour, achieved by grinding semi-precious stone, was always applied as a secondary, ''a secco'' stage, along with the gold leaf applied as haloes and decoration to robes.{{ref label|e|e|none}}
[[File:Daniel project 03.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Daniel's right hand and knee. On the unrestored fresco, the intense red underpainting shows through the black ''a secco'' wash adding luminescence to the shadows. The form under the garment is achieved by the black wash.{{ref label|f|f|none}}]]
The aspect of the colouring which was most unexpected was Michelangelo's treatment of shadows. The painting of the [[Libyan Sibyl]] and the [[Prophet Daniel]], which are side-by-side, are exemplary. On the yellow dress of the Sibyl, Michelangelo has bright yellow highlights, passing through carefully graded tones of deeper yellow to pale orange, darker orange and almost to red in the shadows. While red shadows are of themselves unusual in a fresco, the gradation through adjacent parts of the spectrum is a natural enough solution. On Daniel's robes, there is no such gentle gradation. The yellow lining of his cloak becomes a sudden dense green in the shadows, while the mauve has shadows that are intensely red. These colour combinations, which are best described as iridescent, can be found at various places on the ceiling, including the hose of the young man in the ''Mathan'' lunette which is pale green and reddish purple.

In some instances, the colour combinations look garish: this is particularly the case with the [[Prophet Daniel]]. A comparison of the "restored" and "unrestored" figure gives strong evidence that Michelangelo worked over this figure in a wash of carbon black, and that the technique was preplanned.&lt;ref&gt;as detailed in Arguimbau's article&lt;/ref&gt; The bright red used on the robes of Daniel and the Libyan Sibyl does not, on its own, create effective shadows. In these and many other cases it appears to have been intended as underpainting, to be seen only through a thin black wash and with the deepest shadows picked out in more intense black, as they still are on the [[Cumaean Sibyl]]. This use of bright, contrasting colours as underpainting is not a common feature of frescoes, but it is commonly employed in both [[oil painting]] and [[tempera]]. Like Daniel, the Libyan Sibyl's yellow garment once had much more subtlety in its folds and shadows than it has now.{{ref label|d|d|none}}
[[File:Jonah B.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.15|''Jonah'', restored. Much of the dramatic tonality of the figure has disappeared in the cleaning, diminishing the effect of the foreshortening.]]
There is absolutely no doubt that before the restoration, the whole ceiling was dirtier, more muted and more monochrome than Michelangelo ever intended, but when images of the frescoes are viewed in their stained and unrestored state the subtle washes and intense definitions, described by Beck and Arguimbau,&lt;ref name=PLA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beck/&gt; still make their presence known, giving mass and bulk to the forms.

The painter and biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]], in his ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'', describes the figure of [[Jonah]] as it appeared in the mid-16th century:
{{quote|Then who is not filled with admiration and amazement at the awesome sight of Jonah, the last figure in the chapel? The vaulting naturally springs forward, following the curve of the masonry; but through the force of art it is apparently straightened out by the figure of Jonah, which bends in the opposite direction; and thus vanquished by the art of design, with its lights and shades, the ceiling even appears to recede.&lt;ref name=Vasari&gt;Giorgio Vasari, ''Michelangelo'' from ''Lives of the Artists'',(1568) translated by George Bull, Penguin Classics, (1965) {{ISBN|0-14-044164-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The large figure of Jonah is of great significance to the total composition, both pictorially and theologically, being symbolic of the Risen Christ. The figure occupies the pendentive which rises from the altar wall to support the vault, and strains backward, his eyes turned towards God. The [[foreshortening]] described by Vasari was innovative and highly influential to later painters. The cleaning of this significant figure has left a few remnants of black shadow visible to the extreme left side of the painting. All the other, less intense, black lines and washes have been removed, lessening the impact of the radical foreshortening, and also robbing the great fish, the [[Genius (mythology)|genii]] behind Jonah, and the architectural figures of much detail.

====Eyes====
[[File:Jesse spandrel beforeandafter.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Losses of a sort which are deemed "travesties" by critics of the restoration. The Jesse spandrel, before and after restoration. The eyes are now missing, as they are in numerous other figures, particularly among the ancestors.]]
The missing depth is not the only factor that the critics deplore. An important feature of Michelangelo's work which, in many places, has disappeared forever is the painting of the eyeballs.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt; Eyes appear in many instances to have been painted ''buon fresco''. Wherever they have not been painted [[buon fresco]] but added ''a secco'', they have been removed by the restorers.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt;

They are an essential part of the most impressive and famous of the frescoes, the ''Creation of Adam''. Adam gazes at God. God looks directly at Adam. And under God's protective arm, Eve turns her eyes sideways in a look of admiration for her husband-to-be. Again and again, Michelangelo painted telling gazes into the faces of his characters. The eye sockets of the family in the Zorobabel lunette are empty as are the eyes of the man in the Aminadab lunette, but the removal that has caused the most distress to the critics are the eyes of the little figure in green and white who once looked out of the gloom above the lunette of Jesse.

Arguimbau says:

{{quote|Have you ever felt that some things never fade and remain an inspiration for all time? That was the Sistine Chapel, now chemically stripped down of divine inspiration and looking shockingly out of place.&amp;nbsp;... It is the duty of the restorer not to alter the intent of the artist, but the scientist cannot help himself. Who cares if Colalucci discovered Michelangelo as a colorist and can explain the Colorist trends of Pontormo and Rossi. His job is to make sure the thing is stuck on there and leave it alone. In comparing before and after photos there is much proof that Colalucci removed 'a secco' passages and left many areas sketchy and thin and.{{sic}} Proof of one single change of the artist's intent is negligence of which there are many.|Arguimbau&lt;ref name=PLA/&gt;}}

Richard Serrin, in an essay entitled ''Lies and Misdemeanors: Gianluigi Colalucci's Sistine Chapel Revisited'' says:

{{quote|The [so-called] Glorious Restoration of Michelangelo's frescoes has destroyed them forever. What we say now cannot bring them back to life. We can only speak out to document the accountability of the Vatican restorers so that it does not pass unrecognized.|Richard Serrin&lt;ref name=RS&gt;{{cite web| last =Serrin| first =Richard| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Lies and Misdemeanors, Gianluigi Colalucci's Sistine Chapel Revisted| work =| publisher =| date =| url =http://mimsstudios.com/richardserrinarticle.pdf| format =PDF| doi =| accessdate =| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070202045650/http://www.mimsstudios.com/richardserrinarticle.pdf| archivedate =2007-02-02| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Restoring the light==
Carlo Pietrangeli, former Director General of the Vatican Museums&lt;!--at the time of the restoration?--&gt;, writes of the restoration: "It is like opening a window in a dark room and seeing it flooded with light."&lt;ref name=CP/&gt; His words resonate with those of Giorgio Vasari who, in the 16th century, said of the Sistine Chapel ceiling:

{{quote|There is no other work to compare with this for excellence ... The ceiling has proved a veritable beacon for our art, of inestimable benefit to all painters, restoring light to a world that for centuries had been plunged into darkness.&lt;ref name=Vasari/&gt;}}

Pietrangeli, in his foreword to ''The Sistine Chapel'', written after the restoration of the lunettes, but prior to the restoration of the ceiling, commends those who had the courage to commence the restoration process, and thanks not only those who visited the restoration while it was in progress and gave the benefit of their knowledge and experience, but also those who were critical of the enterprise. Pietrangeli made acknowledgement that these people spurred the team on to punctilious documentation so that a full report of criteria and methods should be available to those who are interested, both in the present and the future.&lt;ref name=CP&gt;Carlo Pietrangeli, Foreword to ''The Sistine Chapel'', ed.

Silt fences are widely used on construction sites in North America and elsewhere, due to their low cost and simple design.&lt;ref&gt;Sprague, C.J. (1999). "Assuring the Effectiveness of Silt Fences and Other Sediment Barriers." Proceedings of Conference 30, International Erosion Control Association, Nashville, TN. pp. 133-154.&lt;/ref&gt; However, their effectiveness in controlling sediment can be limited, due to problems with poor installation, proper placement, and/or inadequate maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brzozowski |first1=Carol |date=Nov–Dec 2006 |title=Silt Fence Installation |journal=Erosion Control |volume=13 |issue=7 |pages= |publisher=Forester Media |doi= |url=http://foresternetwork.com/daily/soil/erosion-control-devices/silt-fence-installation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and installation==
Silt fences are often perimeter controls, typically used in combination with [[sediment basin]]s and [[sediment trap (construction)|sediment trap]]s, as well as [[erosion control]]s, which are designed to retain sediment in place where soil is being disturbed by construction processes (i.e., [[land grading]] and other [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=1992 |title=Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook |edition=3rd |url=http://www.deq.virginia.gov/Portals/0/DEQ/Water/StormwaterManagement/Erosion_Sediment_Control_Handbook/Chapter%202.pdf |publisher=Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VA DEQ) |location=Richmond, VA |chapter=Chapter 2. Erosion and Sediment Control Principles, Practices and Costs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:silt fence EPA.jpg|thumb|right|Silt fence installed on a construction site]]
[[File:Silt fence &amp; chain link support.png|thumb|Chain link supported "super" silt fence]]
A typical fence consists of a piece of [[synthetic fiber|synthetic]] filter fabric (also called a [[geotextile]]) stretched between a series of wooden or metal fence stakes along a horizontal contour level. The stakes are installed on the downhill side of the fence, and the bottom edge of the fabric can be trenched into the soil and backfilled on the uphill side, although it is quite difficult to move the trenched "spoil" from the downside to the upside of the trench. The design/placement of the silt fence should create a pooling of runoff, which then allows sedimentation to occur. Water can seep through the silt fence fabric, but the fabric often becomes "blocked off" with fine soil particles (all sediment-retention devices have this challenge, and none of them "filter" storm water for very long).{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} A few hours after a storm event, the fabric can be "disturbed" in order to dislodge the fines, and allow clean water to flow through. Depending on the protected watershed and erosion, larger soil particles will settle out, ultimately filling the silt fence to the top of the structure; requiring another silt fence above or below it (creating a new ponding area), or for the silt fence to be removed, the sediment removed or spread out, and a new fence installed. The fence is not designed to concentrate or channel stormwater. The fence is installed on a site before soil disturbance begins, and is placed down-slope from the disturbance area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=1992 |title=Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook |edition=3rd |url=http://www.deq.virginia.gov/Portals/0/DEQ/Water/StormwaterManagement/Erosion_Sediment_Control_Handbook/Chapter%203%20-%203.05.pdf |publisher=VA DEQ |section=Spec. 3-05.

Sediment is captured by silt fences primarily through ponding of water and settling, rather than filtration by the fabric. Sand and silt tends to clog the fabric, and then the sediments settle in the temporary pond.&lt;ref name="Fifield"&gt;{{cite book |title=Designing for Effective Sediment and Erosion Control for Construction Sites |last=Fifield |first=Jerald S. |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=Forester Press |location=Santa Barbara, CA |isbn=978-0-9707687-3-5 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.6–9}} &lt;ref name="EPA DD"&gt;{{Cite report |title=Development Document for Final Effluent Guidelines and Standards for the Construction and Development Category |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/construction-and-development-effluent-guidelines-documents |author=EPA |year=2009 |id=EPA-821-R-09-010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.7–46}}

===Super silt fence===
Some government jurisdictions in the [[United States]] recommend or require the use of a reinforced fence, sometimes called a "super" silt fence or an enhanced silt fence, on some construction sites.  This design uses filter fabric reinforced by a wire mesh or [[chain link fence]]. The metal backing gives the fence increased strength to resist the weight of soil and water which may be trapped by the fence in a large drainage area, and discourages construction site operators from driving vehicles over the fence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=1994 |title=1994 Maryland Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control |url=http://www.mde.state.md.us/assets/document/sedimentstormwater/1994ErosionSed_Section_H.pdf |section=Section H - 26.0: Super Silt Fences |publisher=Maryland Department of the Environment |location=Baltimore, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an improper installation of a super silt fence can create an inadvertent sediment basin when the filter fabric becomes clogged.  This typically causes flooding and increased downstream [[water pollution|pollution]]. Most super silt fence specifications are out-dated, requiring the trenching installation method, which has been shown to be highly susceptible to "washing out" under the fabric due to improper back-filling and inadequate compaction.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Static slicing installation===
Some [[U.S. state|state]] agencies recommend an installation technique called "static slicing" as an improved method for ensuring effectiveness and longevity of a silt fence system on a construction site. The technique involves inserting a narrow blade into the soil with a wedge-type point on its tip to slightly disrupt the soil upward, while simultaneously inserting the silt fence fabric into the slot with a moving pivot, while the machine is moving forward. This step is followed by mechanical [[soil compaction]], setting of fence posts, and attaching the fabric.&lt;ref name="EPAsilt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carpenter |first1=Thomas |last2=Sprague |first2=Joel |date=Jul–Aug 2002 |title=Silt Fence Installation Efficacy |journal=Grading and Excavation Contractor |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages= |publisher=Forester Media |url=http://foresternetwork.com/daily/construction/silt-fence-installation-efficacy/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silt fence fabrics (geotextiles) tested in laboratory settings have shown to be effective at trapping sediment particles.&lt;ref name="Barrett"&gt;{{Cite report |title="An Evaluation of the Use and Effectiveness of Temporary Sediment Controls" |url=ftp://ftp.odot.state.or.us/techserv/Geo-Environmental/Environmental/Regulatory%20Documentation%20Forms%20and%20Examples/Water%20Quality/Research%20Technical%20Documents/Barrett%20et%20al%201996.pdf |last1=Barrett |first1=Michael E. |last2=Kearney |first2=John E. |last3=McCoy |first3=Terry G. |last4=Malina |first4=Joseph F., Jr. |last5=Charbeneau |first5=Randall J. |date=March 1996  |publisher=University of Texas at Austin, Center for Transportation Research |id=Research Report 1943-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|45–47}} Although there have been few field tests of silt fences installed at construction sites, these tests have shown generally poor results.&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt;{{rp|27–31, 53–55}} (Effectiveness testing involved measurements for both [[total suspended solids]] and [[turbidity]].) Other studies and articles about silt fence usage and practice document problems with installation and maintenance, implying poor performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Stevens |first1=Ellen |last2=Barfield |first2=Billy J. |last3=Britton |first3=S.L. |last4=Hayes |first4=J.S. |date=2004 |title=Filter Fence Design Aid for Sediment Control at Construction Sites |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=2000D1LT.txt |publisher=EPA |page=22 |id=EPA/600/R-04/185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1998, static slicing the material into the ground has proven to be the most efficient and most effective installation method because slicing maintains the soil on both sides of the fence, and is conducive to proper compaction—which is critical to performance, as well.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In 2000 the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) co-sponsored silt fence efficacy field research through its Environmental Technology Verification Program, and in general, the report found the static slicing method to be highly effective, and efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2001 |title=Environmental Technology Verification Report for Installation of Silt Fence Using the Tommy® Static Slicing Method |url=https://archive.epa.gov/nrmrl/archive-etv/web/pdf/08_vs_tommy.pdf |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Environmental Technology Evaluation Center (EvTEC); Civil Engineering Research Foundation |page= |isbn=0-7844-0565-4}} CERF Report No 40565.&lt;/ref&gt; Silt fence effectiveness is best determined by how many hundreds of pounds of sediment are contained behind a given silt fence after a storm event, and not turbidity, etc. as sediment-retention is the end goal, and not a water-quality measurement used in erosion control, for instance.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
 
Silt fences may perform poorly for a variety of reasons, including improper location (e.g. placing fence where it will not pond runoff water), improper installation (e.g. failure to adequately embed and backfill the lower edge of fabric in the soil) and lack of maintenance—fabric falling off of the posts, or posts knocked down.  A silt fence top-full of sediment may need maintenance/replacement, but it is a huge success.&lt;ref name="Fifield" /&gt;{{rp|p.6–10}} The fabric may become damaged with holes and tears if construction materials are stored next to or on top of the fence. During various phases of construction at a site, a silt fence may be removed relocated and reinstalled multiple times.&lt;ref name="Barrett" /&gt;{{rp|30–31}} It may be difficult to maintain effectiveness of a silt fence under such operating conditions. Location of fences in areas with high flows may lead to fence failures when the installation is not adequately back-filled and properly compacted, and/or the post-spacing is inadequate.&lt;ref name="EPA DD" /&gt;{{rp|p.7–46}}

'''Simon Rogerson''' is lifetime Professor Emeritus in [[Computer Ethics]] at the Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility (CCSR), [[De Montfort University]].&lt;ref&gt;Computer Ethics Pioneer Retires DMYou Issue 33 P8 available at https://issuu.com/ponderblog/docs/dmyou_33&lt;/ref&gt; He was the founder and is the current editor of the Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/products/journals/journals.htm?id=JICES Refs&lt;/ref&gt; He has had two careers; first as a technical software developer and then in academia as reformer (according to Huff and Barnard&lt;ref&gt;Description of Rogerson in Huff, Chuck, Barnard, Laura (2009), Good computing: Moral Exemplars in the Computing Profession, IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, Volume:28, Issue: 3, pp 47-54,. - Huff and Barnard define reformers as being crusaders attempting to change values in social systems and viewing individuals as victims of injustice and attempting to rectify that injustice. http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5247002&lt;/ref&gt;). He was the founding Director of CCSR, launching it in 1995 at the first ETHICOMP conference which he conceived &lt;ref&gt;Companies offered ethics advice, Times Higher Education, April 7, 1995 https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/companies-offered-ethics-advice/97305.article&lt;/ref&gt; and co-directed until 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmu.ac.uk/research/research-faculties-and-institutes/technology/centre-for-computing-and-social-responsibility/ethicomp-series.aspx|title=ETHICOMP Series|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became Europe's first Professor in Computer Ethics in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sigcas.org/awards-1/awards-winners/rogerson|title=SIGCAS Making A Difference Award 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most important research focuses on providing rigorously grounded practical tools and guidance to computing practitioners. For his leadership and research achievements in the computer and information ethics interdisciplinary field he was awarded the fifth IFIP-WG9.2 Namur Award in 2000&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt from the official report: By giving Simon Rogerson ''the 5th IFIP-WG9.2 Namur Award'', we emphasise the need to place the study of ethics on the agenda of international ICT research and practices. https://staff.info.unamur.be/jbl/IFIP/winners.html&lt;/ref&gt; and ''the SIGCAS Making a Difference Award'' in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt from the official report: Professor Rogerson has made and continues to make a world-wide difference in how people view the complex interactions of computers and society. http://www.sigcas.org/awards-1/awards-winners/rogerson&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industrial career ==
As a teenager Rogerson wanted to work in the computer industry. On graduating from the University of Dundee he joined Thorn Lighting as a Fortran Programmer in 1972. He progressed to Senior Systems Analyst before transferring to Thorn EMI in 1976 as Technical Systems Manager and where he became Computer Services Manager in 1981. He left his full-time post in 1983 to pursue a career in academia. However, he maintained his link with industry through freelance consultancy and membership of several professional bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dmu.academia.edu/SimonRogerson/CurriculumVitae|title=Simon Rogerson - De Montfort University - Academia.edu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
Rogerson joined the Department of Information Systems at Leicester Polytechnic (later to become De Montfort University&lt;ref&gt;Leicester Polytechnic became De Montfort University in accordance with the Further and Higher Education Act in 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;) in 1983. He was appointed under a government initiative to attract IT industrialists in to Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;"… the government in 1983 … extra money for universities to spend on information technology courses and 'new blood' posts, mainly in science and technology" p100 in {{cite journal | last1 = Welch | first1 = Penny | year = 2009 | title = The evolution of government policy towards English higher education 1979–2007 | url = | journal = Learning and Teaching | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 96–122 | doi = 10.3167/latiss.2009.020206 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he focused on lecturing about [[Project Management]], [[Systems Analysis]] and Management Support Systems. It was the latter which led him into research starting by co-authoring works with Dr Christine Fidler culminating in the book ''Strategic Management Support Systems'' in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson catalogue http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/Strategic-Management-Support-Systems/9780273614180.page&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teaching ===
Rogerson is an innovative educator. He created and was the founding course leader of a European-focused [[Business Information Systems]] Degree in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;ROGERSON, S., European Language Education for information systems undergraduates, in: Student Skills for the New Europe, Cunningham, L., Editor, Higher Education for Capability, 1993, Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt; He developed student guides for undergraduates, publishing ''Project Skills Handbook'' &lt;ref&gt;ROGERSON, S., Project Skills Handbook, Chartwell-Bratt, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and co-authoring ''Successful Group Work''.&lt;ref&gt;ROGERSON, S., RICE, J., SAUNDERS, C. &amp; O'SULLIVAN, T., Successful group work, Kogan Page, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced a series of course modules focussing on computer and information ethics. Rogerson and Tugrul Esendal developed and delivered an innovative course module addressing quality assurance and ethics in Software Engineering for which they received a ''Research Informed Teaching Award'' in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;ESSENDAL, T. &amp; ROGERSON, S. (2011) A holistic approach to software engineering education.  In HUSSEY, M., WU, B. &amp; XU, X. (editors) Software industry oriented education practice and curriculum development: experiences and lessons. IGI Global. Chpt 5 pp83-97&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the Information Society Doctoral Programme which continues to attract research students worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmu.ac.uk/research/research-faculties-and-institutes/technology/centre-for-computing-and-social-responsibility/postgraduate-study/postgraduate-study.aspx|title=Postgraduate Study|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, funded by HEFCE (Higher Education Funding Council of England) Rogerson developed a virtual learning environment for doctoral students at De Montfort University where they could learn about and discuss research ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Research Ethics: Online (REST7 525 ) Course Description, Research training programme handbook 2010/11, p13. available at http://www.dmu.ac.uk/documents/research-documents/graduate-school/current-students/research-development-programme/rtphandbook2010-11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 he ran a Masters Summer School on the Social Impact of Computing at Gdansk University of Technology, Poland.&lt;ref&gt;"Simon Rogerson: making a difference 2005" interviewed by Ken Himma,. ACM SIGCAS Computers and Society, Celebrating SIGCAS' 40th Anniversary - Interviews with Past SIGCAS Award Recipients, Volume 39, Issue 2 (September 2009) pp22-23. available at http://www.sigcas.org/awards-1/interview-with-simon-rogerson&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research ===
Through sharing his IS/IT industrial experience with his students Rogerson realised that current professional practice was having little effect on reducing the risk of IS/IT system failure. This led him to focus his research on new interdisciplinary approaches to IS/IT project management, design and implementation which embraced computer and information ethics.&lt;ref&gt;ROGERSON, S. (2015) Future Vision, Special Issue - 20 years of ETHICOMP, Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society, Volume 13, Issue 3/4, pp.346 – 360.&lt;/ref&gt; He and [[Donald Gotterbarn]] created the Software Development Impact Statement (SoDIS) process which encourages those involved in IS/IT project management to consider the wider ramifications of their work.&lt;ref&gt;Gotterbarn, D and Rogerson, S (2005), Responsible Risk Analysis for Software Development: Creating the Software Development Impact Statement, Communications of the Association for Information Systems, Volume 15, Article 40. at http://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/vol15/iss1/40/&lt;/ref&gt; An associated decision support tool, SoDIS Project Auditor was developed and successfully used around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softimp.com.au/sodis/sodis_process.html|title=Software Improvements :: SoDIS Process®|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of the BCS Ethics Strategic Panel, he was one of the creators of DIODE, an ethical assessment tool for new and emerging technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = Ian | last2 = Jennings | first2 = Richard C. | last3 = Pullinger | first3 = David | last4 = Rogerson | first4 = Simon | last5 = Duquenoy | first5 = Penny | year = 2011 | title = Ethical assessment of new technologies: a meta methodology | url = | journal = Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 49–64 | doi=10.1108/14779961111123223}}&lt;/ref&gt; He conceived and co-developed a dependency mapping method for the implementation of technological innovations.&lt;ref&gt;ROGERSON, S., WILFORD, S and FAIRWEATHER, N.B. (2013) A dependencies mapping method for personal health monitoring. in Schmidt, S. &amp; Rienhoff, O (eds).Interdisciplinary Assessment of Personal Health Monitoring. Vol 187 of Studies in Health Technology and Informatics. IOS Press, {{ISBN|9781614992554}}. available at http://ebooks.iospress.nl/volumearticle/34521&lt;/ref&gt; Rogerson’s research extended to IS/IT application areas with notable work in [[electronic voting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fairweather | first1 = NB | last2 = Rogerson | first2 = S | year = 2005 | title = Interfaces for electronic voting: focus group evidence | url = | journal = Electronic Government, an International Journal | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 369–383 | doi = 10.1504/EG.2005.008329 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and personal health monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson was a principal investigator on EU-funded PHM-Ethics project see http://ethics.p-h-m.org/consortium.html&lt;/ref&gt;
A second important focus of Rogerson’s research is [[professionalism]] in computing. His book ''Ethical aspects of information technology: Issues for senior executives'', published in 1998 for the Institute of Business Ethics, remains one the few to address ethics of computing from a corporate perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson, Simon, (1998), Ethical aspects of information technology: issues for senior executives, Institute of Business Ethics, {{ISBN|0952402041}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has made significant contributions to the development of professional standards in several computer related bodies. He was a member of the executive team which developed the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) / [[IEEE Computer Society]] (IEEE-CS) Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice for which he received the ''IEEE Certificate of Appreciation'' in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;De Montfort University, RAE 2001 submission to Library and Information Management, RA6a: Additional observations, Evidence of esteem available at http://www.rae.ac.uk/2001/Submissions/Textform.asp?route=2&amp;HESAInst=H-0068&amp;UoA=61&amp;Msub=Z&amp;Form=RA6a&lt;/ref&gt; He led the development of the code of ethics for the Institute for the Management of Information Systems &lt;ref&gt;MCROBB, S., ROGERSON, S., FAIRWEATHER, N.B., Code of Ethics, IMIS Journal, April, Vol 10 No 2, 2000, pp 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; and the redevelopment of the Code of Good Practice of BCS, The Chartered Institute of IT.&lt;ref&gt;http://bcs.org/upload/pdf/cop.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1998 and 2010 Rogerson led a longitudinal survey to explore the attitudes of information systems professionals. It provides a unique snapshot as seen through an ethical lens.&lt;ref&gt;IS IT Ethical? 2010 ETHICOMP Survey of Professional Practice https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299485534_IS_IT_Ethical_2010_ETHICOMP_Survey_of_Professional_Practice?ev=prf_pub&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioner access to Rogerson’s research was made possible through his regular ''ETHIcol'' column which he wrote for the IMIS Journal from 1995 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccsr.cse.dmu.ac.uk/resources/general/ethicol.html|title=CCSR: ETHIcol by Simon Rogerson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leadership ===
Rogerson has been the prime instigator in establishing a computer and information ethics movement in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Bynum, Terrell, "Computer and Information Ethics", in Edward N. Zalta (ed.) The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2015 Edition) available at http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/ethics-computer/&lt;/ref&gt; As founding director of the Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility (CCSR) his visionary leadership resulted in the ETHICOMP conference series, which he co-directed with [[Terrell Ward Bynum|Terry Bynum]], and the Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society. Professor Krystyna Gorniak, who attended ETHICOMP 95, wrote to Rogerson on 10 April 1995, "… the newly established CCSR is one of the prominent steps towards the creation of a world-wide network of scholars who are concerned about humankind's wellbeing in the age of computers …" CCSR's web site, which was launched in 1997, became the world's leading portal for computer and information ethics. With over 2 million annual visits&lt;ref&gt;Total hits 2,117,448 worldwide, in last 12 months Usage statistics for www.ccsr.cse.dmu.ac.uk, generated 30 April 2003 23.58 BST, using Webalizer Version 2.01&lt;/ref&gt; it remained so until the advent of social media. There have been 15 ETHICOMP conferences to date with around 1,250 papers being presented.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson, S. (2015) The ETHICOMP Odyssey: 1995 to 2015, ResearchGate. {{DOI| 10.13140/RG.2.1.2660.1444}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ETHICOMP'' name has become recognised and respected in the field of computer and information ethics and in 1999 it was registered as a trademark by De Montfort University to control its use and ensure ongoing integrity on behalf of the ETHICOMP community.&lt;ref&gt;Trademark no. UK00002184304  details available at https://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmcase/Results/1/UK00002184304&lt;/ref&gt; Now in its fourteenth volume, the Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society aims to promote thoughtful dialogue regarding the wider social and ethical issues related to the planning, development, implementation and use of new media and information and communication technologies &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journal/jices|title=EmeraldInsight|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His leadership extends into professional bodies. As chairman of the Institute for the Management of Information Systems (2009-2013) he led its incorporation into BCS – The Chartered Institute for IT (formerly [[British Computer Society]]) in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;"Following an overwhelming majority vote from its membership, the Institute for the Management of Information Systems (IMIS), has ratified its decision to merge with BCS - The Chartered Institute for IT, with immediate effect. The agreement will see all IMIS professional members transfer into BCS membership." http://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/50485&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe he was one a five-person commission which undertook the review of FP6 (the European Union's Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development for the period 2002 to 2006) reporting its findings and recommendations to the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Invited member of the 2005 FP6 Monitoring Review Panel of the European Commission see report at http://ec.europa.eu/research/reports/2005/pdf/final_report_monitoring_2005_response_commission_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He led the development of the ethics guidelines for the ICT work programme of FP7 (European Union's Research and Innovation. funding programme for 2007-2013), making it mandatory for all [[European Union]] funded ICT research to address explicitly the ethical issues surrounding prospective research activity.&lt;ref&gt;Annex 5: Ethical Guidelines for undertaking ICT research in FP7, Guide for Applicants: Information and Communication Technologies ( FP7-ICT-2013-10), pp64-66. available at http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/doc/call/fp7/fp7-ict-2013-10/32886-gfa_cp-csa_for_pcp_v2_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Congres Team 10 in Otterlo - Team 10 Meeting in Otterlo.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Otterlo]] Meeting 1959 (also CIAM '59), organized by Team 10, 43 participants. Meeting place: [[Kröller-Müller Museum]], located in the [[Hoge Veluwe National Park]]. Dissolution of the organization CIAM.]]
'''Team 10''' — just as often referred to as '''Team X''' or '''Team Ten''' — was a group of architects and other invited participants who assembled starting in July 1953 at the 9th Congress of the [[Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne|International Congresses of Modern Architecture (CIAM)]] and created a schism within CIAM by challenging its doctrinaire approach to [[urbanism]].

==Membership==
The group's first formal meeting under the name of Team 10 took place in [[Bagnols-sur-Cèze]] in 1960. The last, with only four members present, was in Lisbon in 1981.

Team 10's core group consists of [[Pancho Guedes]], Rolf Gutmann, [[Geir Grung (architect)|Geir Grung]], Oskar Hansen,&lt;ref&gt;Stanek, L. ed., Team 10 East. Revisionist Architecture in Real Existing Modernism (Warsaw: Museum of Modern Art/ Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reima Pietilä]], Charles Polonyi, Brian Richards, [[Jerzy Soltan]], [[Oswald Mathias Ungers]], [[John Voelcker]], and Stefan Wewerka.

They referred to themselves as "a small family group of architects who have sought each other out because each has found the help of the others necessary to the development and understanding of their own individual work."&lt;ref name="alison"&gt;Smithson, Alison [ed] ''Team 10 Primer'', [[MIT Press|The MIT Press]], (1968), {{ISBN|0-289-79556-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Team 10's theoretical framework, disseminated primarily through teaching and publications, had a profound influence on the development of architectural thought in the second half of the 20th century, primarily in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Two different movements emerged from Team 10: the [[New Brutalism]] of the English members (Alison and Peter Smithson) and the [[Structuralism (architecture)|Structuralism]] of the Dutch members (Aldo van Eyck and Jacob Bakema).

==History==
Team 10's core group started meeting within the context of CIAM, the international platform for modern architects founded in 1928.&lt;ref name="Team10online Intro"&gt;http://www.team10online.org [http://www.team10online.org/team10/introduction.html ''Introduction - The Team 10 story''] by Max Risselada &amp; Dirk van den Heuvel.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Theory of Legal Norms''''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Teoria della Norma Giuridica'') is a book, published in 1958, by the [[Italia]]n [[jurist]] [[Norberto Bobbio]] about one of the [[Ontology|ontological]] elements of [[philosophy of law|foundations of law]] &amp;mdash; the legal norm.

== Importance ==
Seen by scholars as an important work&lt;ref name="UNIN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FILIPPI"&gt;{{cite book|last=Filippi|first=Alberto|last2=Lafer|first2=Celso|title=A Presença de Bobbio|place=São Paulo|publisher=UNESP|year=2004|page=87|isbn=8571395713}}&lt;/ref&gt; in understanding of a conceptual constructivist approach of the [[scientific method|scientific way]] of thinking law in the new era of the [[jurisprudence of values]], Bobbio's book faces this challenge in six chapters.

== Chapters&lt;ref&gt;Bobbio, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; ==
# Law as behavior rule: he shows three theories that lead, according to him, to a unique, non-paradoxical concept system: ''regulational'', ''intersubjective'' and ''institutional''.
# Discusses the two main schools of legal theory: [[legal positivism]] and theories of [[natural law]].
# Approaches the norm in its formal aspect, analyzing ''propositions'', ''prescriptions'', ''expressions'', ''imperatives'', ''commands'' and ''advices''.
# Discusses imperatives specifically, as well as their relationship with [[value judgement]]s, ''permissions'' and the addressees of a norm.
# ''Sanctions'' of norms (prescribed consequences of their violation); the necessity of sanctions to characterize a norm.
# Classifications of norms and the ''[[sine qua non]]'' character of ''[[generalization]]-[[abstraction]]''.

== Criticism ==
"In this book, Bobbio defends a ''positive'' philosophy committed to the scientific soul and against [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] points of view. Bobbio breaks from jusnaturalists tendencies, considering law as a speech to be submitted to the [[language]] analysis, inside the borderlines of a scientific theory, according to the paradigm of the [[logical positivism]]"&lt;ref name="SHV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pt.shvoong.com/law-and-politics/1708639-teoria-da-norma-jur%C3%ADdica/|title=Teoria da Norma Jurídica|date=19 November 2007|publisher=Shvoong - A Fonte Global de Resumos e Críticas|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Bobbio presents his position about ''sanctions''. According to him, sanction is the response to violation of a law. Analyzing sanction under the point of view of efficacy, the relation between law and force appears. For [[Kelsen]], law exists to regulate force. For Bobbio, sanctions are means to obtain the ''desirable human behavior''. Bobbio emphasizes the positive sanctions (awards) in opposition to repressive ones."&lt;ref name="CIEH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cienciashumanas.com.br/resumo_artigo_7097/artigo_sobre_o_pensamento_jur%C3%8Ddico_de_norberto_bobbio|title=O Pensamento Jurídico de Norberto Bobbio|publisher=Ciências Humanas.coml.br|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In this book, Bobbio analyzes the ''law as rule of behavior'', showing a general view  and a criticism of the various theories that intend to reveal the concept of law, concluding that, although all the theories are integrated,  the normativist one prevails in sense of constituting pressuposed of validity for the other ones"&lt;ref name="UNIN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.uninove.br/ojs/index.php/prisma/article/viewFile/513/492|title=Bobbio, Norberto.

The community of third gender may also face discrimination from within the gay community. Despite having been legalized in the majority of South Asia, sexual minorities in Sri Lanka are hesitant to fight for third gender rights as departing from the traditional binary gender concept might make it harder to push through other aspects of LGBT rights.  It's notably that the island's two neighboring Indian states were among the first in the post-colonial world to legally recognize third gender.

==Sex and gender==
Since at least the 1970s, [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] have described [[gender role|gender categories]] in some cultures which they could not adequately explain using a two-gender framework.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; At the same time, [[Feminism|feminists]] began to draw a distinction between (biological) [[sex]] and (social/psychological) [[gender]]. Contemporary [[gender studies|gender theorists]] usually argue that a two-gender system is neither innate nor universal. A sex/gender system which recognizes only the following two social [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] has been labeled "[[heteronormative]]".{{By whom|date=May 2018}}

Anthropologist Michael G. Peletz believes our notions of different types of genders (including the attitudes toward the third gender) deeply affect our lives and reflects our values in society. In Peletz' book, "Gender, Sexuality, and Body Politics in Modern Asia", he describes:&lt;ref name=Gender&gt;{{cite book|last=Peletz|first=Michael G.|title=Gender, Sexuality, and Body Politics in Modern Asia|year=2007|publisher=Association for Asian Studies|location=Michigan|isbn=9780924304507}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|For our purposes, the term "gender" designates the cultural categories, symbols, meanings, practices, and institutionalized arrangements bearing on at least five sets of phenomena: (1) females and femininity; (2) males and masculinity; (3) Androgynes, who are partly male and partly female in appearance or of indeterminate sex/gender, as well as intersexed individuals, also known as hermaphrodites, who to one or another degree may have both male and female sexual organs or characteristics; (4) transgender people, who engage in practices that transgress or transcend normative boundaries and are thus by definition "transgressively gendered"; and (5) neutered or unsexed/ungendered individuals such as eunuchs.}}

=== Intersex people and third gender ===
{{main|Legal recognition of intersex people|Intersex and LGBT}}
[[Intersex]] people are born with [[sex]] characteristics, such as [[chromosome]]s, [[gonad]]s, or [[genital]]s that, according to the UN [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], "do not fit typical binary notions of [[male]] or [[female]] bodies".&lt;ref name="unfe-fact"&gt;{{Cite web| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | publisher = United Nations [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | title = Free &amp; Equal Campaign Fact Sheet: Intersex| date = 2015| url = https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf | access-date = 28 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[sex and gender distinction]] is not universal, and Peletz's description of gender as designating biological variations as well as cultural practices is not unique. In a study of arguments that intersex people fit into a third gender classification, intersex scholar [[Morgan Holmes]] argues that much analysis of a third sex or third gender is simplistic:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holmes |first=Morgan |author-link=Morgan Holmes |date=July 2004 |title=Locating Third Sexes |url=http://www.transformationsjournal.org/issues/08/article_03.shtml |journal=Transformations Journal |volume= |issue=8 |pages= |issn=1444-3775 |accessdate=2014-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110091545/http://www.transformationsjournal.org/issues/08/article_03.shtml |archivedate=2017-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|much of the existing work on cultural systems that incorporate a 'third sex' portray simplistic visions in which societies with more than two sex/gender categories are cast as superior to those that divide the world into just two. I argue that to understand whether a system is more or less oppressive than another we have to understand how it treats its various members, not only its 'thirds'.}}

The [[Asia Pacific Forum]] of National Human Rights Institutions states that the legal recognition of intersex people is firstly about access to the same rights as other men and women, when assigned male or female; secondly it is about access to administrative corrections to legal documents when an original [[sex assignment]] is not appropriate; and thirdly it is not about the creation of a third sex or gender classification for intersex people as a population but it is, instead, about self-determination.&lt;ref name="afp2016"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = [[Asia Pacific Forum|Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions]]| isbn = 978-0-9942513-7-4| last = Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions| title = Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics| date = June 2016| url = http://www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/manual-sogi-and-sex-charactersitics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transgender people and third gender ===
Gender may be organized differently in different cultures. In some non-Western cultures, gender is not binary and one can cross freely between male and female. This is seen as a mediation between the spirit and mundane worlds.&lt;ref name="SellIngrid"&gt;Sell, Ingrid M.  "Third gender: A qualitative study of the experience of individuals who identify as being neither man nor woman."  The Psychotherapy Patient.  13.1/2 (2004): p.132&lt;/ref&gt; It is seen as a positive and is almost revered in many Eastern cultures, whereas in Western culture, people who don’t conform to [[heteronormative]] ideals are often seen as sick, disordered, or insufficiently formed.&lt;ref name="SellIngrid" /&gt;

To the Indigenous [[Māhū]] of Hawaii, it is an intermediate state between man and woman, or to be a "person of indeterminate gender";&lt;ref name="vargas2015" /&gt; While the traditional [[Navajo|Dineh]] of the Southwestern US acknowledge four genders: feminine woman, masculine woman, feminine man, masculine man.&lt;ref name=Estrada/&gt; The term "third gender" has also been used to describe [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]]s of South Asia&lt;ref name="agrawal1997" /&gt; who have gained legal identity, [[fa'afafine]] of Polynesia, and [[Albanian sworn virgins|sworn virgins]] of the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref name="Young"/&gt;

In Africa{{Vague|date=August 2018}}, a woman can be recognized as a “female husband” who enjoys all of the privileges of men and is recognized as such, but whose femaleness, while not openly acknowledged, is not forgotten either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stern|first1=E Mark|last2=Marchesani|first2=Robert B|title=Saints and Rogues: Conflicts and Convergence in Psychotherapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QtIJBAAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-71804-8|page=135|chapter=Third gender: A qualitative study of the experience of individuals who identify as being neither man nor woman|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=QtIJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]]s, of India, are one of the most recognized and socially accepted groups of third genders. This may be a result of the notion of [[reincarnation]], which reduces not only gender categorization but also sex and species, allowing for more fluid and mutable categorization. There are countless other cultures in which the third gender is seen as an intermediate being rather than as a movement from one conventional sex to the other, either male to female or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Hines, Sally, and Tam Sanger. Transgender Identities: Towards a Social Analysis of Gender Diversity. New York: Routledge, 2010. Print. p.244&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of people in the United States who thought themselves to be members of a third gender, Ingrid M. Sell found that they typically felt different from the age of 5.&lt;ref name="SellIngrid_a"&gt;Sell, Ingrid M.  "Third gender: A qualitative study of the experience of individuals who identify as being neither man nor woman."  The Psychotherapy Patient.  13.1/2 (2004): p.139&lt;/ref&gt; Because of both peer and parental pressure, those growing up with the most ambiguous appearances had the most troubled childhoods and difficulties later in life. Sell also discovered similarities between the third genders of the East and those of the West. Nearly half of those interviewed were healers or in the medical profession. A majority of them, again like their Eastern counterparts, were artistic enough to make a living from their abilities. The capacity to mediate between men and women was a common skill, and third genders were oftentimes thought to possess an unusually wide perspective and the ability to understand both sides.&lt;ref name="SellIngrid_a" /&gt; A notable result of Sell's study is that 93% of the third genders interviewed, again like their Eastern counterparts, reported “paranormal”-type abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Sell, Ingrid M.  "Third gender: A qualitative study of the experience of individuals who identify as being neither man nor woman."  The Psychotherapy Patient.  13.1/2 (2004): p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, some Western societies have begun to recognize genderqueer or non-binary identities. Some years after Alex MacFarlane, Australian [[Norrie May-Welby]] was recognized as having unspecified status.&lt;ref name="Daily"&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2010/03/16/2010-03-16_no_sex_for_me_please_extranssexual_briton_is_first_legally_genderless_person.html "No sex for me, please!

The [[Open Society Foundations]] published a report, ''License to Be Yourself'' in May 2014, documenting "some of the world's most progressive and rights-based laws and policies that enable trans people to change their gender identity on official documents".&lt;ref name=License&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrne |first=Jack |author-link= |title= License to Be Yourself |year=2014|publisher=[[Open Society Foundations]] |location=New York |isbn=9781940983103 |url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/reports/license-be-yourself | accessdate=2014-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report comments on the recognition of third classifications, stating:
{{quote|
From a rights-based perspective, third sex / gender options should be voluntary, providing trans people with a third choice about how to define their gender identity. Those identifying as a third sex / gender should have the same rights as those identifying as male or female.}}

The document also quotes [[Mauro Cabral]] of [[Global Action for Trans Equality]]:
{{quote|
People tend to identify a third sex with freedom from the gender binary, but that is not necessarily the case. If only trans and/or intersex people can access that third category, or if they are compulsively assigned to a third sex, then the gender binary gets stronger, not weaker.}}

The report concludes that two or three options are insufficient: "A more inclusive approach would be to increase options for people to self-define their sex and gender identity."&lt;ref name="License" /&gt;

=== Third gender and sexual orientation ===
[[Image:Thirdsex bookcover 1959.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cover of Artemis Smith's 1959 [[lesbian pulp fiction]] novel ''The Third Sex'']]

Before the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s, there was no common non-derogatory vocabulary for [[Non-heterosexuals|non-heterosexuality]]; terms such as "third gender" trace back to the 1860s.&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld 1904"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis 1897"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fordham.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duc, Aimée 1901"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Social Studies C"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=E.

(1980) ''The "third sex" theory of Karl Heinrich Ulrichs'', Journal of Homosexuality. 1980–1981 Fall–Winter; 6(1–2): pp. 103–1&lt;/ref&gt;

One such term, [[Uranian]], was used in the 19th century to a person of a third sex—originally, someone with "a female psyche in a male body" who is sexually attracted to men. Its definition was later extended to cover [[homosexual]] [[gender variant]] females and a number of other sexual types. It is believed to be an [[English language|English]] adaptation of the [[German language|German]] word ''Urning'', which was first published by activist [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] (1825–95) in a series of five booklets (1864–65) that were collected under the title ''Forschungen über das Räthsel der mannmännlichen Liebe'' ("Research into the Riddle of Man-Male Love"). Ulrich developed his terminology before the first public use of the term "homosexual", which appeared in 1869 in a pamphlet published anonymously by [[Karl-Maria Kertbeny]] (1824–82). The word Uranian (''Urning'') was derived by Ulrichs from the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] [[Aphrodite Urania]], who was created out of [[Uranus (mythology)|the god Uranus' testicles]]; it stood for homosexuality, while Aphrodite Dionea (''Dioning'') represented heterosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmkaylor.com Michael Matthew Kaylor, ''Secreted Desires: The Major Uranians: Hopkins, Pater and Wilde'' (Brno, CZ: Masaryk University Press, 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; Lesbian activist [[Anna Rueling]] used the term in a 1904 speech, "What Interest Does the Women's Movement Have in Solving the Homosexual Problem?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pAny0qfa6qsC&amp;pg=PA79|title=Finding Out: An Introduction to LGBT Studies|first1=Deborah T.|last1=Meem|first2=Michelle|last2=Gibson|first3=Michelle A.|last3=Gibson|first4=Jonathan|last4=Alexander|date=28 May 2018|publisher=SAGE|via=Google Books|isbn=9781412938655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some scholars, the West is trying to reinterpret and redefine ancient third-gender identities to fit the Western concept of [[sexual orientation]]. In ''Redefining [[Fa'afafine]]: Western Discourses and the Construction of Transgenderism in Samoa'', Johanna Schmidt argues that the Western attempts to reinterpret fa'afafine, the third gender in Samoan culture, make it have more to do with sexual orientation than gender. She also argues that this is actually changing the nature of fa'afafine itself, and making it more "homosexual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue6/schmidt.html|title=Intersections: Redefining Fa'afafine: Western Discourses and the Construction of Transgenderism in Samoa|website=intersections.anu.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Samoan fa'afafine said, "But I would like to pursue a master's degree with a paper on homosexuality from a Samoan perspective that would be written for educational purposes, because I believe some of the stuff that has been written about us is quite wrong."&lt;ref&gt;[http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue6/schmidt.html Redefining Fa'afafine: Western Discourses and the Construction of Transgenderism in Samoa Johanna Schmidt]; Intersections: Gender, History and Culture in the Asian Context; Issue 6, August 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''How to become a Berdache: Toward a unified analysis of gender diversity'', Will Roscoe writes that "this pattern can be traced from the earliest accounts of the Spaniards to present-day ethnographies. What has been written about berdaches reflects more the influence of existing Western discourses on gender, sexuality and the Other than what observers actually witnessed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phenomenologycenter.org/course/berdache.htm How to become a Berdache: Toward a unified analysis of gender diversity] Will Roscoe  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226235121/http://www.phenomenologycenter.org/course/berdache.htm |date=February 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Towle and Morgan:

{{quote|Ethnographic examples [of ‘third genders’] can come from distinct societies located in Thailand, Polynesia, Melanesia, Native America, western Africa, and elsewhere and from any point in history, from Ancient Greece, to sixteenth century England to contemporary North America. Popular authors routinely simplify their descriptions, ignoring...or conflating dimensions that seem to them extraneous, incomprehensible, or ill suited to the images they want to convey (484).&lt;ref&gt;[http://feed.belowthebelt.org/2009/10/great-third-gender-debate.html The Great Third Gender Debate; BELOW THE BELT, theory-q] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503222350/http://feed.belowthebelt.org/2009/10/great-third-gender-debate.html |date=May 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Western scholars often do not make a distinction between people of the third gender and males; they are often lumped together. The scholars usually use gender roles as a way to explain sexual relations between the third gender and males. For example, when analyzing the non-normative sex gender categories in [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]], Peter A. Jackson says it appears that within early Buddhist communities, men who engaged in receptive anal sex were seen as feminized and were thought to be [[hermaphrodite]]s. In contrast, men who engaged in oral sex were not seen as crossing sex/gender boundaries, but rather as engaging in abnormal sexual practices without threatening their masculine gendered existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rspas.anu.edu.au/papers/pah/theravada.html Non-normative Sex/Gender Categories in the Theravada Buddhist Scriptures]

Some writers suggest that a third gender emerged around 1700 AD in [[England]]: the male [[sodomy|sodomite]].&lt;ref name="Trumbach"&gt;Trumbach, Randolph. (1998) ''Sex and the Gender Revolution. Volume 1: Heterosexuality and the Third Gender in Enlightenment London''. Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1998. (Chicago Series on Sexuality, History &amp; Society)&lt;/ref&gt; According to these writers, this was marked by the emergence of a [[subculture]] of [[effeminate]] males and their meeting places ([[molly house]]s), as well as a marked increase in hostility towards effeminate or [[homosexual]] males. People described themselves as members of a third sex in Europe from at least the 1860s with the writings of [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1300/J082v06n01_10 | title=The "Third Sex" Theory of Karl Heinrich Ulrichs | year=1981 | last1=Kennedy | first1=Hubert | journal=Journal of Homosexuality | volume=6 | pages=103–111 | pmid=7042820 | issue=1–2  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing in the late nineteenth century with [[Magnus Hirschfeld]],&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld 1904"&gt;[[Magnus Hirschfeld|Hirschfeld, Magnus]], 1904.

''Sind es Frauen? Roman über das dritte Geschlecht'' ("Are These Women? Novel about the Third Sex")&lt;/ref&gt; and others. These writers described themselves and those like them as being of an "inverted" or "intermediate" sex and experiencing homosexual desire, and their writing argued for social acceptance of such sexual intermediates.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, James W. (1990). ''"We of the third sex” : homo Representations of Homosexuality in Wilhelmine Germany.'' (German Life and Civilization v. 7) New York: Peter Lang Publishing, 1990. {{ISBN|0-8204-1209-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cited precedents from classical Greek and Sanskrit literature (see below).

Throughout much of the twentieth century, the term "third sex" was a common descriptor for homosexuals and gender nonconformists, but after the [[gay liberation]] movements of the 1970s and a growing separation of the concepts of [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]], the term fell out of favor among [[LGBT communities]] and the wider public. With the renewed exploration of gender that feminism, the modern [[transgender]] movement and [[queer theory]] has fostered, some in the contemporary West have begun to describe themselves as a third sex again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Sell |first1= Ingrid |year=2001 |title=Not man, not woman: Psychospiritual characteristics of a Western third gender |journal= [[Journal of Transpersonal Psychology]] |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages= 16–36 }} (Complete doctoral dissertation: Sell, Ingrid. (2001). ''Third gender: A qualitative study of the experience of individuals who identify as being neither man nor woman.'' (Doctoral Dissertation, Institute of Transpersonal Psychology). UMI No. 3011299.)&lt;/ref&gt; Other modern identities that cover similar ground include [[pangender]], [[bigender]], [[genderqueer]], [[androgyne]], [[intergender]], "other gender" and "differently gendered".

=== Third gender and feminism ===

In [[German Empire#Wilhelmine era|Wilhelmine Germany]], the terms ''drittes Geschlecht'' ("third sex") and ''Mannweib'' ("man-woman") were also used to describe [[feminist]]s – both by their opponents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=407320 | pages=582–599 | last1=Wright | first1=B. D. | title="New Man," Eternal Woman: Expressionist Responses to German Feminism | volume=60 | issue=4 | journal=[[The German Quarterly]] | year=1987 | doi=10.2307/407320  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes by feminists themselves. In the 1899 novel ''Das dritte Geschlecht'' (''The Third Sex'') by Ernst Ludwig von Wolzogen, feminists are portrayed as "neuters" with external female characteristics accompanied by a crippled male [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]].

==History==

===Mesopotamia===
[[Image:Sumerian creation myth.jpg|thumb|upright|Stone tablet from 2nd millennium BC Sumer containing a myth about the creation of a type of human who is neither man nor woman.]]
In [[Mesopotamian mythology]], among the earliest written records of humanity, there are references to types of people who are not men and not women. In a [[Sumer]]ian [[creation myth]] found on a stone tablet from the [[second millennium BC]], the goddess [[Ninmah]] fashions a being "with no male organ and no female organ", for whom [[Enki]] finds a position in society: "to stand before the king". In the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] myth of [[Atra-Hasis]] (ca. 1700 BC), Enki instructs [[Nintu]], the goddess of birth, to establish a “third category among the people” in addition to men and women, that includes demons who steal infants, women who are unable to give birth, and priestesses who are prohibited from bearing children.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stephen O., and Roscoe, Will (1997). ''Islamic Homosexualities: Culture, History, and Literature.'' New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Babylonia]], [[Sumer]] and [[Assyria]], certain types of individuals who performed religious duties in the service of [[Inanna]]/[[Ishtar]] have been described as a third gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=1062813 | accessdate=2 April 2011 | pages=195–230 | last1=Roscoe | first1=W. | title=Priests of the Goddess: Gender Transgression in Ancient Religion | volume=35 | issue=3 | journal=[[History of Religions (journal)|History of Religions]] | year=1996 | url=http://www.willsworld.org/priests.html | doi=10.1086/463425}} Roscoe identifies these temple staff by the names ''kalû'', ''kurgarrû'', and ''assinnu''.&lt;/ref&gt; They worked as [[sacred prostitute]]s or [[Hierodule]]s, performed ecstatic dance, music and plays, wore masks and had gender characteristics of both women and men.&lt;ref&gt;Nissinen, Martti (1998).

He described the ''kulu'u'' as effeminate and the ''kurgarru'' as [[transvestism|transvestite]]. In addition, he defines another kind of gender-variant prostitute, ''sinnisānu'', as (literally) "woman-like".&lt;/ref&gt;

A third sex is discussed in ancient [[Hindu law]], medicine, [[linguistics]] and [[astrology]]. The foundational work of Hindu law, the [[Manu Smriti]] (c. 200 BC–200 AD) explains the biological origins of the three sexes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A male child is produced by a greater quantity of male seed, a female child by the prevalence of the female; if both are equal, a third-sex child or boy and girl twins are produced; if either are weak or deficient in quantity, a failure of conception results.&lt;ref&gt;[[Manu Smriti]], 3.49. [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/manu/manu03.htm Text online].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Indian linguist [[Patañjali]]'s&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with the [[Patañjali]] who was the author of the ''[[Yoga sutras]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; work on [[Sanskrit]] grammar, the [[Mahābhāṣya]] (c. 200 BC), states that Sanskrit's three [[grammatical genders]] are derived from three natural genders. The earliest [[Tamil language|Tamil]] grammar, the [[Tolkappiyam]] (3rd century BC) refers to hermaphrodites as a third "neuter" gender (in addition to a feminine category of unmasculine males). In [[Vedic astrology]], the nine planets are each assigned to one of the three genders; the third gender, ''tritiya-prakrti'', is associated with [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Saturn]] and (in particular) [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]]. In the [[Puranas]], there are references to three kinds of [[deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s of music and dance: [[apsaras]] (female), [[gandharva]]s (male) and [[kinnar]]s (neuter).

The two great [[Sanskrit]] [[epic poem]]s, the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]],&lt;ref&gt;Lord [[Arjuna]] takes a "vow of eunuchism" to live as the third sex for a year: "O lord of the Earth, I will declare myself as one of the neuter sex. O monarch, it is, indeed difficult to hide the marks of the bowstring on my arms. I will, however, cover both my [[Scarification|cicatrized]] arms with bangles. Wearing brilliant rings on my ears and [[conch]]-bangles on my wrists and causing a braid to hang down from my head, I shall, O king, appear as one of the third sex, Vrihannala by name. And living as a female I shall (always) entertain the king and the inmates of the inner apartments by reciting stories. And, O king, I shall also instruct the women of Virata's palace in singing and delightful modes of dancing and in musical instruments of diverse kinds. And I shall also recite the various excellent acts of men..." [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/15475 Mahabharata (Virata-parva)], Translated by Ganguli, Kisari Mohan. [[Project Gutenberg]].&lt;/ref&gt; indicate the existence of a third gender in ancient Indic society. Some versions of [[Ramayana]] tell that in one part of the story, the hero [[Rama]] heads into exile in the forest. Halfway there, he discovers that most of the people of his home town [[Ayodhya]] were following him. He told them, "Men and women, turn back", and with that, those who were "neither men nor women" did not know what to do, so they stayed there. When Rama returned from exile years later, he discovered them still there and blessed them, saying that there will be a day when they, too, will have a share in ruling the world.

In the Buddhist [[Vinaya]], codified in its present form around the 2nd century BC and said to be handed down by oral tradition from [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] himself, there are four main sex/gender categories: males, females, ''ubhatobyañjanaka'' (people of a dual sexual nature) and ''[[Pandaka|paṇḍaka]]'' (people of non-normative sexual natures, perhaps originally denoting a deficiency in male sexual capacity).&lt;ref name="Jackson10996" /&gt; As the Vinaya tradition developed, the term ''paṇḍaka'' came to refer to a broad third sex category which encompassed intersex, male and female bodied people with physical or behavioural attributes that were considered inconsistent with the natural characteristics of man and woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=3176712 | pages=89–115 | last1=Gyatso | first1=J. | title=One Plus One Makes Three: Buddhist Gender, Monasticism, and the Law of the Non-Excluded Middle | volume=43 | issue=2 | journal=[[History of Religions (journal)|History of Religions]] | year=2003 | doi=10.1086/423006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to what is often portrayed in the West, sex with male (specifically receptive oral and anal sex) was the gender role of the third gender, not their defining feature. Thus, in ancient India, as in present-day India, the society made a distinction between a third gender having sex with a man, and a man having sex with a man. The latter may have been viewed negatively, but he would be seen very much as a man (in modern western context, as 'straight'), not a third gender (in modern western context 'gay').&lt;ref&gt;[http://rspas.anu.edu.au/papers/pah/theravada.html Non-normative Sex/Gender Categories in the Theravada Buddhist Scriptures], compiled by Peter A. Jackson; quote: "it appears that among the early Buddhist communities men who engaged in receptive anal sex were seen as feminized and thought to be hermaphrodites. In contrast, men who engaged in oral sex were not seen as crossing sex/gender boundaries, but rather as engaging in abnormal sexual practices without threatening their masculine gendered existence."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mediterranean culture===
[[Image:Hermaphroditus Louvre face.jpg|thumb|right|2nd century Roman copy of a Greek sculpture. The figure is [[Hermaphroditus]], from which the word [[hermaphrodite]] is derived.]]

In Plato's ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', written around the 4th century BC, Aristophanes relates a creation myth involving three original sexes: female, male and androgynous. They are split in half by Zeus, producing four different contemporary sex/gender types which seek to be reunited with their lost other half; in this account, the modern heterosexual man and woman descend from the original androgynous sex. The myth of [[Hermaphroditus]] involves heterosexual lovers merging into their primordial androgynous sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/symposium.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive – Symposium by Plato|website=classics.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{non-primary source needed|date=June 2016}}

Other [[creation myth]]s around the world share a belief in three original sexes, such as those from northern Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Peter A. (1995) ''Kathoey: The third sex.'' In Jackson, P., "Dear Uncle Go: Male homosexuality in Thailand." Bangkok, Thailand: Bua Luang Books&lt;br&gt;See also: Peltier, Anatole-Roger (1991). ''Pathamamulamuli: The Origin of the World in the Lan Na Tradition''. Chiang Mai, Thailand: Silkworm Books. The Yuan creation myth in the book is from Pathamamulamuli, an antique Buddhist palmleaf manuscript. Its translator, Anatole-Roger Peltier, believes that this story is based on an oral tradition which is over five hundred years old.

Many have interpreted the "[[eunuch]]s" of the Ancient Eastern Mediterranean world as a third gender that inhabited a [[liminality|liminal]] space between women and men, understood in their societies as somehow neither or both.&lt;ref&gt;S. Tougher, ed., (2001) ''Eunuchs in Antiquity and Beyond'' (London: Duckworth Publishing, 2001).&lt;br&gt;Ringrose, Kathryn M. (2003). ''The Perfect Servant: Eunuchs and the Social Construction of Gender in Byzantium.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Historia Augusta]], the eunuch body is described as a ''tertium genus hominum'' (a third human gender),&lt;ref&gt;[[Historia Augusta]], ''[[Severus Alexander]]'' xxiii.7.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 77 BC, a eunuch named Genucius was prevented from claiming goods left to him in a [[will (law)|will]], on the grounds that he had voluntarily mutilated himself (''amputatis sui ipsius'') and was neither a woman or a man (''neque virorum neque mulierum numero'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]], (7.7.6).&lt;/ref&gt; Several scholars have argued that the eunuchs in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[New Testament]] were understood in their time to belong to a third gender, rather than the more recent interpretations of a kind of emasculated man, or a metaphor for [[chastity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hester |first1= J.

And elsewhere: "The Lord Himself opened the kingdom of heaven to eunuchs and He Himself lived as a eunuch. The apostle [Paul] also, following His example, made himself a eunuch..."&lt;/ref&gt; Tertullian also noted the existence of a third sex (''tertium sexus'') among heathens: "a third race in sex... made of male and female in one."&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''Ad nationes'', 1.20.4. [http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian06.html Text online].&lt;/ref&gt; He may have been referring to the [[Galli]], "eunuch" devotees of the [[Phrygia]]n goddess [[Cybele]], who were described as belonging to a third sex by several [[ancient Rome|Roman]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. "Both sexes are displeasing to her holiness, so [the gallus] keeps a middle gender (''medium genus'') between the others." [[Prudentius]], Peristephanon, 10.1071-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
In old Israel there were:
*''Zachar'': male
*''Nekeva'': female
*''[[Androgynos]]'': both male and female genitalia (eternal doubt of legal gender)
*''[[Tumtum (Judaism)|Tumtum]]'': genitalia concealed by skin (unknown gender, unless skin removed)
*''Aylonit'': Barren female. Female genitalia, barren.
*''Saris'': castrated or naturally infertile male (often translated as "eunuch")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transtorah.org/PDFs/Classical_Jewish_Terms_for_Gender_Diversity.pdf] Classic Jewish terms for Gender Diversity&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://transtorah.org/PDFs/Gender_Diversity_In_Halacha.pdf] Gender Diversity in Halakha&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Americas===

====Mesoamerica====

The ancient [[Maya civilization]] may have recognised a third gender, according to historian Matthew Looper. Looper notes the androgynous [[Maize]] Deity and masculine [[Lunar deity|Moon goddess]] of [[Maya mythology]], and iconography and inscriptions where rulers embody or impersonate these deities. He suggests that the third gender could also include two-spirit individuals with special roles such as healers or [[divination|diviners]].&lt;ref&gt;Looper, Matthew G. (2001). ''Ancient Maya Women-Men (and Men-Women): Classic Rulers and the Third Gender'', In: "Ancient Maya Women", ed. Traci Ardren. Walnut Creek, California: Alta Mira, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist and archaeologist Miranda Stockett notes that several writers have felt the need to move beyond a two-gender framework when discussing prehispanic cultures across [[mesoamerica]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=40025092 | pages=566–578 | last1=Stockett | first1=M.

Austin, TX: University of Texas Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and concludes that the [[Olmec]], [[Aztec]] and [[Maya peoples]] understood "more than two kinds of bodies and more than two kinds of gender." Anthropologist Rosemary Joyce agrees, writing that "gender was a fluid potential, not a fixed category, before the Spaniards came to Mesoamerica. Childhood training and ritual shaped, but did not set, adult gender, which could encompass third genders and alternative sexualities as well as "male" and "female." At the height of the Classic period, Maya rulers presented themselves as embodying the entire range of gender possibilities, from male through female, by wearing blended costumes and playing male and female roles in state ceremonies." Joyce notes that many figures of mesoamerican art are depicted with male genitalia and female breasts, while she suggests that other figures in which chests and waists are exposed but no sexual characteristics (primary or secondary) are marked may represent a third sex, ambiguous gender or androgyny.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, Rosemary A.

====Inca====
Andean Studies scholar Michael Horswell writes that third-gendered ritual attendants to ''chuqui chinchay'', a [[jaguar]] deity in [[Incan mythology]], were "vital actors in Andean ceremonies" prior to [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonisation]]. Horswell elaborates: "These ''quariwarmi'' (men-women) [[shaman]]s mediated between the symmetrically dualistic spheres of Andean cosmology and daily life by performing rituals that at times required same-sex erotic practices. Their transvested attire served as a visible sign of a third space that negotiated between the masculine and the feminine, the present and the past, the living and the dead. Their shamanic presence invoked the androgynous creative force often represented in Andean mythology."&lt;ref&gt;Horswell, Michael J. (2006).

{{quote|And in each important temple or house of worship, they have a man or two, or more, depending on the idol, who go dressed in women's attire from the time they are children, and speak like them, and in manner, dress, and everything else they imitate women.

''Sex and Conquest.'' Cornell University Press: Ithaca. p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Illiniwek====
Historically, the [[Illinois Confederation|Indigenous people of Illinois]] have decided the gender of their members based on their childhood behavior. If a male child used tools considered to be "women's tools", such as a spade or ax instead of a bow, they were considered to be third gender, feminine men. The modern, [[Pan-Indianism|pan-Indian]] term for this role is "[[Two-Spirit]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Joyce. 2000. Gender and Power in Prehispanic Mesosamerica. University of Texas Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

George, Quote: Siva: The Hermaphrodite

The Lord [[Shiva]] is the underlying neutral and changeless reality, the undifferentiated absolute Consciousness, who is the foundation of every change and becoming. The hermaphrodite reality is one which is independent of all distinctions of male and female, the phenomenal and the non-phenomenal, and yet forms the basis of all such distinctions. The Puranas speak of Lord Shiva as the Hermaphrodite reality, though distinctionless within Himself, letting the distinctions of the manifold world spring up from Him. The Puranic thinkers interpreted and represented this hermaphrodite aspect of the Lord Siva in various ways. One such symbol expression is the figure of His Sakti. Another such symbol is the Phallus *(the male reproductive part) and the Yoni (the female reproductive part). A third, a more anthropomorphic metaphor, is that of the union between Siva and His many consorts, such as, Parvati, Uma and others. All these symbolisms express the truth that the variety of this universe stems from the lord Siva through his Sakti. To explain this point very picturesquely, the Puranas apply the mythological story of creation by way of the sexual union between Prajaapati and his daughter to Siva who, by His eternal union with His Sakti creates the world. The Puraanas also use another more sacrificial symbollism to expound the hermaphrodite characteristic of Shiva, according to which the male principle is represented as Fire, the devourer of the offering, and the female principle is the Soma, the devoured offering. In this symbolism, the hermaphrodite is the embodiment of the cosmic sacrifice, through which the universe emerges from the Lord Siva.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the [[common era]], male cults devoted to a goddess that flourished throughout the broad region extending from the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] to [[South Asia]]. While [[galli]] were missionizing the Roman Empire, [[Gala (priests)|kalū]], kurgarrū, and assinnu continued to carry out ancient rites in the temples of Mesopotamia, and the third-gender predecessors of the hijra were clearly evident. It should also be mentioned of the eunuch priests of Artemis at Ephesus; the western Semitic qedeshim, the male "temple prostitutes" known from the Hebrew Bible and Ugaritic texts of the late second millennium; and the keleb, priests of Astarte at Kition and elsewhere. Beyond India, modern ethnographic literature document gender variant shaman-priests throughout [[Southeast Asia]], [[Borneo]], and [[Sulawesi]]. All these roles share the traits of devotion to a goddess, gender transgression and receptive anal sex, ecstatic ritual techniques (for healing, in the case of kalū and Mesopotamian priests, and fertility in the case of hijra), and actual (or symbolic) castration. Most, at some point in their history, were based in temples and, therefore, part of the religious-economic administration of their respective city-states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willsworld.org/priests.html Priests of the Goddess: Gender Transgression in Ancient Religion] by Will Roscoe&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''B. Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering''' was founded in 1960 by professors Borys Vyerkin, Oleksandr Halkin, B.Eselson and Ihor Dmytrenko. The first director was Vyerkin. 

The institute conducts basic research in experimental and theoretical physics, mathematics, as well as in the field of applied physics. Main areas of research are [[high-temperature superconductivity]], weak superconductivity, magneto antiferromagnets, physics of low-dimensional systems, point-contact spectroscopy, quantum crystals, nonlinear phenomena in metals, physics of disordered systems, quantum phenomena in plasticity and others. The institute has published about 250 monographs, textbooks, reference books, more than 12,000 articles and reviews in ranking scientific journals, and has trained more than 850 highly qualified experts&amp;nbsp;— PhDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.city.kharkov.ua/ru/news/ftint-perlina-harkova-igor-terehov-3403.html|title=ФТИНТ&amp;nbsp;— Pearl Kharkov|author=Igor Terekhov|date=May 25, 2010|accessdate=2011-10-11|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67Jk6oXTE?url=http://old.city.kharkov.ua/ru/news/ftint-perlina-harkova-igor-terehov-3403.html|archivedate=April 30, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On May 13, 1960 the presidium of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]] issued a decision to establish the Kharkiv Physics and Technical Institute for Low Temperatures on the initiative of several scientists from the [[Ukrainian Institute of Physics and Technology]]. 

The institute was created by nine laboratories involved in low temperature physics. Four math departments were also established. In 1987 they were organized into the ILTPE [[Mathematical Division of B. Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering|Mathematics Department]].

In 1991 ILTPE was named after its founder&amp;nbsp;— B. Verkin.

'''Women in government''' in the modern era are under-represented in most countries worldwide. Women have inadequate opportunities in social participation, especially in striving for political rights and power in the government and different institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Namibia|first=Sister|last2=Windhoek|date=1989|title=Women in government|url=https://search-proquest-com.easyaccess1.lib.cuhk.edu.hk/docview/194900864/fulltext/15F1461D90D946E1PQ/1?accountid=10371|journal=1(3)|volume=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social status of women is relatively poor compared to men in different countries around the world, that contributes to generating the atmosphere of inferiority of women in the society.

However more and more women are pursuing leadership positions in the present day.

Women, as the conventional primary caretakers of children, often have a more prominent role than men in advocating for children, resulting in a "double dividend" in terms of the benefits of women's representation.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt; Female representatives not only advance women's rights, but also advance the rights of children. In national legislatures, there is a notable trend of women advancing gender and family-friendly legislation. This advocacy has been seen in countries ranging from [[France]], [[Sweden]] and the [[Netherlands]], to [[South Africa]], [[Rwanda]], and [[Egypt]]. Furthermore, a number of studies from both industrialized and developed countries indicate that women in local government tend to advance social issues.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt; In India, for instance, greater women's representation has corresponded with a more equitable distribution of community resources, including more gender-sensitive spending on programs related to health, nutrition, and education.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In 1954, the [[United Nations]] ''[[Convention on the Political Rights of Women]]'' went into force, enshrining women's equal rights to vote, hold office, and access public services as provided for male citizens within national laws.

== Worldwide status of women's representation in government ==
[[File:Prof. Dr. Lala Shevket, Leader of Azerbaijan Liberal Party.jpg|thumb|World's first female [[Secretary of State]] [[Lala Shevket]] at the office of [[Azerbaijan Liberal Party]]]]
As of October 25, 2013, the global average of women in national assemblies is 21.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Women in Parliaments: World and Regional Averages | url = http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/world.htm | website = ipu.org | publisher = [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] |accessdate=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, large differences exist between countries, e.g. Sri Lanka has quite low female participation rates in parliament compared with Denmark, Sweden and Norway, where female representation rates are among the highest.&lt;ref name="Carmichael" /&gt; Four of the top ten countries in 2017 were in South America (Bolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua and Mexico), and the Americas have seen the greatest aggregate change over the past 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://apolitical.co/solution_article/which-countries-have-most-women-in-parliament/|title=Mapped: which countries have the most women in parliament|work=Apolitical|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New figures are available for up to February 2014 from International IDEA, Stockholm University and Inter-Parliamentary Union. (2014) at http://www.quotaproject.org/quotas.cfm

Although over 60% of countries have reached at least 10% women in their national legislature, far fewer have crossed the 20% and 30% barriers. By February 2006, only about 10% of sovereign nations had more than 30% women in [[parliament]].&lt;ref name="Paxton"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Paxton | first1 = Pamela | last2 = Hughes | first2 = Melanie M. | last3 = Kunovich | first3 = Sheri L. | title = Gender in politics | journal = [[Annual Review of Sociology]] | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 263–284 | publisher = [[Annual Reviews (publisher)|Annual Reviews]] | doi = 10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131651 | date = August 2007 | url = https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131651 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major English-speaking democracies are placed mostly in the top 40% of the ranked countries. New Zealand ranks at position 27 with women comprising 32.2% of its parliament. Australia (24.7% in the lower house, 38.2% in the upper house) and Canada (24.7% lower house, 37.9% upper house) rank at position 46 out of 189 countries. The United Kingdom is ranked at 58 (22.5% lower house, 22.6% upper house), while the United States ranks 78 (17.8% in the lower house, 20.0% in the upper house).&lt;ref name="Inter-Parliamentary Union" /&gt; It should be noted that not all of these lower and/or upper houses in national parliaments are democratically elected; for example, in Canada members of the upper house (the Senate) are appointed.

Paxton describes three factors that are the basis for why national level representation has become much larger over the past several decades. The first is the changing structural and economic conditions of nations, which says that educational advancements along with an increase in women's participation in the labor force encourages representation.&lt;ref name="Kunovich"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Paxton | first1 = Pamela | last2 = Kunovich | first2 = Sheri L. | title = Pathways to power: the role of political parties in women's national political representation | journal = [[American Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 111 | issue = 2 | pages = 505–552 | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press|Chicago Journals]] | doi = 10.1086/444445 | jstor = 10.1086/ajs.2005.111.issue-2 | date = September 2005 | url = https://doi.org/10.1086/444445 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second is the political factor; representation of women in office being based on a proportionality system. Some voting systems are built so that a party that gains 25% of the votes gains 25% of the seats. In these processes, a political party feels obligated to balance the representation within their votes between genders, increasing women's activity in political standing. A [[Plurality voting system|plurality-majority system]], such as the one the United States, United Kingdom, and India has, only allows single candidate elections, and thus allows political parties to entirely dictate regions' representatives even if they only control a small majority of the vote. Last, there is the ideological disposition of a country; the concept that the cultural aspects of women's roles or positions in the places they live dictate where they stand in that society, ultimately either helping or handicapping those women from entering political positions.&lt;ref name="Kunovich" /&gt;

==Pathways to political involvement==

Globally, there have been 4 general pathways that have lead women into political office:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Henderson |first1=Sarah L. |last2=Jeydel |first2=Alana S. |title=Women and Politics in a Global World |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=0199899665 |pages=20–21 |chapter=1. Women and International Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Political family - women in this path come from families that have a long history of in involvement in electoral politics.
* Surrogate - women in this path have assumed office, often temporarily, as a surrogate for a father, husband, or brother who has recently died.
* Party or political insider – women in this path start at the bottom of a party or political ladder and work their way up over time filling in necessary roles to show loyalty to the party.
* Political outsider – women in this path usually lack political experience but they run on a platform emphasizing new political changes and serve as an alternative to the status quo.

==Challenges faced by women==
Women face numerous obstacles in achieving representation in governance.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

=== Societal challenges ===
Gender inequality within families, inequitable [[division of labor]] within households, and cultural attitudes about [[gender roles]] further subjugate women and serve to limit their representation in public life.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;  Societies that are highly [[patriarchal]] often have local power structures that make it difficult for women to combat.&lt;ref name="Social Development 2005"&gt;{{citation | last = UNRISD | author-link = United Nations Research Institute for Social Development | contribution = Overview | editor-last = UNRISD | editor-link = United Nations Research Institute for Social Development | title = Gender equality: striving for justice in an unequal world | page = xxi | publisher = [[United Nations Research Institute for Social Development]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | year = 2006 | isbn = 9789290850731 | url = http://www.unrisd.org/80256B3C005BCCF9/search/1FF4AC64C1894EAAC1256FA3005E7201 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, their interests are often not represented or under-represented.

=== Systematic challenges ===
There have been many arguments saying the plurality-majority voting system is a disadvantage to the chance that women get into office. [[Andrew Reynolds (political scientist)|Andrew Reynolds]] brings forth one of these arguments by stating: "Plurality-majority single-member-district systems, whether of the Anglo-American [[first-past-the-post]] (FPTP) variety, the Australian preference ballot [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]] (AV), or the French [[two-round system]] (TRS), are deemed to be particularly unfavorable to women's chances of being elected to office".&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt; [[Andrew Reynolds (political scientist)|Andrew]] believes that the best systems are [[List proportional representation|list-proportional systems]]. "In these systems of high proportionality between seats won and votes cast, small parties are able to gain representation and parties have an incentive to broaden their overall electoral appeal by making their candidate lists as diverse as possible".&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt;

Even once elected, women tend to hold lesser valued cabinet ministries or similar positions.&lt;ref name="Basu, Amriyta 2003" /&gt; These are sometimes described as "soft industries" and include health, education, and welfare.  Far less often do women hold executive decision-making authority in more powerful domains or those that are associated with traditional notions of masculinity (such as finance and the military).  Typically, the more powerful the institution, the less likely it is that women's interests will be represented.  Additionally, in more autocratic nations, women are less likely to have their interests represented.&lt;ref name="Social Development 2005" /&gt; Many women attain political standing due to kinship ties, as they have male family members who are involved in politics.&lt;ref name="Basu, Amriyta 2003" /&gt; These women tend to be from higher income, higher status families and thus may not be as focused on the issues faced by lower income families. In The United States, the lower end of the professional ladder contains a higher proportion of women while the upper level contains a higher proportion of men. Research shows that women are underrepresented in head positions in state agencies making up only 18% of congress and 15% of corporate board positions. When women do gain any level of representation it is in the fields of health, welfare, and labor. They are seen to be addressing issues labeled as feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Amy E.|last2=Monaghan|first2=Karen R.|date=2013-01-01|title=Some Ceilings Have More Cracks: Representative Bureaucracy in Federal Regulatory Agencies|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0275074011420997|journal=The American Review of Public Administration|language=en|volume=43|issue=1|pages=50–71|doi=10.1177/0275074011420997|issn=0275-0740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Challenges of personal life and choices ===
Additionally, women running for public office typically gain additional, unnecessary scrutiny on their private lives.  For instance, fashion choices of politically active women are often picked apart by the media. In these "analyses" women rarely gain approval from those in the media, who usually say they either they show too much skin or too little, or perhaps that they either look too feminine or too masculine.  Sylvia Bashevkin also notes that their romantic lives are often subject of much interest to the general population, perhaps more so than their political agenda or stances on issues.&lt;ref name="Bashevkin 2009 86–89"&gt;{{Citation | last = Bashevkin | first = Sylvia | contribution = Vexatious Vixens | editor-last = Bashevkin | editor-first = Sylvia | title=Women, Power, Politics: The Hidden Story of Canada's Unfinished Democracy |year=2009|publisher= Oxford University Press|pages=86–89 | isbn = 9780195431704 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; She points out that those who "appear to be sexually active outside a monogamous heterosexual marriage run into particular difficulties, since they tend to be portrayed as vexatious vixens"&lt;ref name="Bashevkin 2009 88"&gt;{{Citation | last = Bashevkin | first = Sylvia | contribution = Vexatious Vixens | editor-last = Bashevkin | editor-first = Sylvia | title=Women, Power, Politics: The Hidden Story of Canada's Unfinished Democracy |year=2009|publisher= Oxford University Press|page=88 | isbn = 9780195431704 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are more interested in their private romantic lives than in their public responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Bashevkin 2009 86–89"/&gt;  If they are in a monogamous, married relationship but have children, then their fitness for office becomes a question of how they manage being a politician while taking care of their children, something that a male politician would rarely, if ever, be asked about.

===Challenges within political parties===
In Canada, there is evidence that female politicians face gender stigma from male members of the political parties to which they belong which can undermine the ability of women to reach or maintain leadership roles. [[Pauline Marois]], leader of the [[Parti Québécois]] (PQ) and the official opposition of the [[National Assembly of Quebec]], was the subject of a claim by Claude Pinard, a PQ "[[backbencher]]", that many Quebecers do not support a female politician: "I believe that one of her serious handicaps is the fact she's a woman [...] I sincerely believe that a good segment of the population won't support her because she's a woman".&lt;ref name="Banerjee"&gt;{{cite news|last=Banerjee|first=Sidhartha|title=PQ woes prompt debate in Quebec about whether women get a fair deal in politics|url=http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/pq-woes-prompt-debate-in-quebec-about-whether-women-get-a-fair-deal-in-politics-1.720302|accessdate=November 2, 2011|work=[[The Canadian Press]]|date=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2000 study that analyzed 1993 election results in Canada found that among "similarly situated women and men candidates", women actually had a small vote advantage. The study showed that neither voter turnout nor urban/rural constituencies were factors that help or hurt a female candidate, but "office-holding experience in non-political organizations made a modest contribution to women's electoral advantage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Black | first1 = J.H. | last2 = Erickson | first2 = Lynda | title = Women candidates and voter bias: do women politicians need to be better? | journal = [[Electoral Studies]] | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 81–100 | publisher = [[ScienceDirect]] | doi = 10.1016/S0261-3794(01)00028-2 | date = March 2003 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/S0261-3794(01)00028-2 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce M. Hicks, an electoral studies researcher at Université de Montréal, states that evidence shows that female candidates begin with a head start in voters' eyes of as much as 10 per cent, and that female candidates are often more favorably associated by voters with issues like health care and education.&lt;ref name="Banerjee"/&gt; The electorate's perception that female candidates have more proficiency with traditional women's spheres such as education and health care presents a possibility that gender stereotypes can work in a female candidate's favor, at least among the electorate. In politics, however, Hicks points out that sexism is nothing new:
{{blockquote|(Marois' issue) does reflect what has been going on for some time now: women in positions of authority have problems in terms of the way they manage authority [...] The problem isn't them, it's the men under them who resent taking direction from strong women. And the backroom dirty dialogue can come into the public eye.&lt;ref name="Banerjee"/&gt;}}

Within Quebec itself, Don McPherson pointed out that Pinard himself has enjoyed greater electoral success with Pauline Marois as party leader than under a previous male party leader, when Pinard failed to be elected in his riding. Demographically, Pinard's electoral riding is rural, with "relatively older, less-well educated voters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McPherson|first=Don|title=Pauline Marois's troubles aren't because of sexism| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120107020557/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Pauline+Marois+troubles+aren+because+sexism/5648719/story.html | archive-date = January 7, 2012|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Pauline+Marois+troubles+aren+because+sexism/5648719/story.html|accessdate=November 13, 2011|work=[[Montreal Gazette]] | location = Canada|date=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's suffrage movement==
[[File:Suffragette_parade._Grand_Marshall,_Mrs._Richard_Burleson;_Herald,_Miss_Inez_Milholland.jpg|thumb|left|Suffragette demonstration, 1913, Washington, D.C.]]
{{Main|Women's suffrage movement}}
[[Women's suffrage]] is the right of women to vote in elections. Most countries enacted women's suffrage in the first half of the 20th century. New Zealand was the first country to grant women the right to vote. On the 19th of September in 1893, New Zealand became the first country that allowed women the right to participate in elections. The change in the law was a result of a petition headed by Kate Shepherd on behalf of the Women's Temperance Union. The petition was signed by 32000 women, almost one in four of New Zealand women at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/voting-rights/page-4|title=4.  – Voting rights – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|last=Taonga|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, the last countries to enact it were [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]]. In Switzerland, women gained the [[Women's suffrage in Switzerland|right to vote]] in federal [[Elections in Switzerland|elections]] in 1971;&lt;ref name="switzerland-chronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html |title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology |website=history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch | publisher = History of Switzerland |accessdate=January 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the canton of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/WOM1373.doc.htm |title= Experts in women's anti-discrimination committee raise questions concerning reports of Switzerland on compliance with convention | date = 14 January 2003 |website=un.org | publisher = [[United Nations]] |accessdate=September 2, 2011}} Press release: Meeting of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).&lt;/ref&gt; In Liechtenstein, women were given the right to vote by the [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1984|women's suffrage referendum of 1984]].

==Mirror representation==

Women's participation in formal politics is lower than men's throughout the world.&lt;ref name=NandW1&gt;{{citation | last1 = Newman | first1 = Jacquetta | last2 = White | first2 = Linda A. | contribution = The women's movement in Canada | editor-last1 = Newman | editor-first1 = Jacquetta | editor-last2 = White | editor-first2 = Linda A. | title = Women, politics, and public policy: the political struggles of Canadian women | page = 88 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Don Mills, Ontario | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780195432497 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The argument put forth by scholars Jacquetta Newman and Linda White is that women's participation in the realm of high politics is crucial if the goal is to affect the quality of public policy. As such, the concept of ''mirror representation'' aims to achieve gender parity in public office. In other words, mirror representation says that the proportion of women in leadership should match the proportion of women in the population that they govern. Mirror representation is premised on the assumption that elected officials of a particular gender would likely support policies that seek to benefit constituents of the same gender.

=== Effects of mirror representation on public policy ===
A key critique is that mirror representation assumes that all members of a particular sex operate under the rubric of a shared identity, without taking into consideration other factors such as age, education, culture, or socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name="Pitkin 1967 61"&gt;{{Citation | last = Pitkin | first = Hannah F. | contribution = Formalistic views of representation | editor-last = Pitkin | editor-first = Hannah F. | title=The concept of representation |year=1967|publisher= University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|page=61 | isbn = 9780520021563 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, proponents of mirror representation argue that women have a different relationship with government institutions and public policy than that of men, and therefore merit equal representation on this facet alone. This feature is based on the historical reality that women, regardless of background, have largely been excluded from influential legislative and leadership positions. As Sylvia Bashevkin notes, "representative democracy seems impaired, partial, and unjust when women, as a majority of citizens, fail to see themselves reflected in the leadership of their polity."&lt;ref name="Bashevkin 2009 15"&gt;{{Citation | last = Bashevkin | first = Sylvia | contribution = Introduction | editor-last = Bashevkin | editor-first = Sylvia | title=Women, power, politics: the hidden story of Canada's unfinished democracy |year=2009|publisher= Oxford University Press|page=15 | isbn = 9780195431704 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the issue of participation of Women in politics is of such importance that the United Nations has identified gender equality in representation (i.e. mirror representation) as a goal in the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)]] and the [[Fourth World Conference on Women#Beijing Platform for Action|Beijing Platform for Action]].&lt;ref name="NandW2"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Newman | first1 = Jacquetta | last2 = White | first2 = Linda A. | contribution = The women's movement in Canada | editor-last1 = Newman | editor-first1 = Jacquetta | editor-last2 = White | editor-first2 = Linda A. | title = Women, politics, and public policy: the political struggles of Canadian women | page = 89 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Don Mills, Ontario | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780195432497 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides seeking equality, the goal of mirror representation is also to recognize the significance of women's involvement in politics, which subsequently legitimizes said involvement.

There have been differing results between studies that looked at the significance of women's representation on actual policy outcomes. Though women in the United States are more likely to identify as feminists,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/feminism-project/poll/|title=What Americans think about feminism today|last=Cai|first=Weiyi|date=January 27, 2016|access-date=November 11, 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 2014 study looking in the United States finds "no effect of gender of the mayor on policy outcomes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ferreira | first1 = Fernando | last2 = Gyourko | first2 = Joseph | title = Does gender matter for political leadership?

===Social and cultural barriers to mirror representation===
Mirror representation stems from the barriers female political candidates often face, these include: sex stereotyping, political socialization, lack of preparation for political activity, and balancing work and family. In the media, women are often asked how they would balance the responsibilities of elected office with those to their families, something men are never asked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Beaudoux García | first = Virginia | title = Five ways the media hurts female politicians — and how journalists everywhere can do better | url = https://theconversation.com/five-ways-the-media-hurts-female-politicians-and-how-journalists-everywhere-can-do-better-70771 | work = [[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] | location = Melbourne, Australia | date = January 18, 2017 | access-date = January 26, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sex stereotyping'''. Sex stereotyping assumes that masculine and feminine traits are intertwined with leadership. Hence, the bias leveled against women stems from the perception that femininity inherently produces weak leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kittilson | first1 = Miki C. | last2 = Fridkin | first2 = Kim | title = Gender, candidate portrayals and election campaigns: a comparative perspective | journal = [[Politics and Gender]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | page = 373 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] | doi = 10.1017/S1743923X08000330 | date = September 2008 | url = https://doi.org/10.1017/S1743923X08000330 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the aggressive and competitive nature of politics, many insist that participation in elected office requires masculine traits.&lt;ref name="MacIvor 1996 240"&gt;{{Citation | last = MacIvor | first = Heather | contribution = Women's participation in politics | editor-last = MacIvor | editor-first = Heather | title=Women and politics in Canada: an introductory text |year=1996|publisher=Broadview Press|location=Peterborough, Ontario|page=242 | isbn = 9781551110363 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sex stereotyping is far from being a historical narrative. The pressure is on female candidates (and not male ones) to enhance their masculine traits in order to garner support from voters who identify with socially constructed gender roles.{{citation needed|reason=the claim that women in politics are pressured to conform to masculine roles is one that should be supported with research|date=February 2016}}

'''Political socialization'''. Political socialization is the idea that, during childhood, people are indoctrinated into socially constructed norms of politics. In the case of women's representation in government, it says that sex stereotyping begins at an early age and affects the public's disposition on which genders are fit for public office. Socialization agents can include family, school, higher education, mass media, and religion.&lt;ref name="NandW3"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Newman | first1 = Jacquetta | last2 = White | first2 = Linda A. | contribution = Women's participation in formal politics | editor-last1 = Newman | editor-first1 = Jacquetta | editor-last2 = White | editor-first2 = Linda A. | title = Women, politics, and public policy: the political struggles of Canadian women | page = 99 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Don Mills, Ontario | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780195432497 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these agents plays a pivotal role in either fostering a desire to enter politics, or dissuading one to do so.

Generally, girls tend to see politics as a "male domain".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gidengil | first1 = Elisabeth | last2 = O'Neill | first2 = Brenda | last3 = Young | first3 = Lisa | title = Her mother's daughter?

Women running for U.S senate are often underrepresented in news coverage. The way male and females are depicted in media has an effect of how female's candidates gets elected in to public office. Female candidates get treated differently in the media then their male counterparts in the U.S senate elections, Women receive less news coverage also the coverage they do receive concentrates more on their viability and less on their issue positions, causes female candidates to be overlooked and underrated during elections, which is an obstacle for women running for U.S senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kahn|first=Kim Fridkin|last2=Goldenberg|first2=Edie N.|date=1991-01-01|title=WOMEN CANDIDATES IN THE NEWS: AN EXAMINATION OF GENDER DIFFERENCES IN U.S. SENATE CAMPAIGN COVERAGE|url=https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/55/2/180/1810869|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|language=en|volume=55|issue=2|pages=180–199|doi=10.1086/269251|issn=0033-362X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lack of preparation for political activity'''. An aftereffect of political socialization is that it determines how inclined women are to pursue careers that may be compatible with formal politics. Careers in law, business, education, and government, professions in which women happen to be minorities, are common occupations for those that later decide to enter public office.&lt;ref name=NandW4 /&gt;

'''Balancing work and family'''. The work life balance is invariably more difficult for women, because they are generally expected by society to act as the primary caregivers for children and maintainers of the home. Due to these demands, it is assumed that women would choose to delay political aspirations until their children are older. Also, a women's desire for a career in politics along with the extent that the respondent feels her family duties might inhibit her ability to be an elected official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elder|first1=Laurel|title=Why Women Don't Run|journal=Women &amp; Politics|date=21 September 2004|volume=26|issue=2|pages=27–56|doi=10.1300/J014v26n02_02|issn=0195-7732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that new female politicians in Canada and the U.S. are older than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=NandW5&gt;{{citation | last1 = Newman | first1 = Jacquetta | last2 = White | first2 = Linda A. | contribution = Women's participation in formal politics | editor-last1 = Newman | editor-first1 = Jacquetta | editor-last2 = White | editor-first2 = Linda A. | title = Women, politics, and public policy: the political struggles of Canadian women | page = 102 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Don Mills, Ontario | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780195432497 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a woman may be pushed to remain childless in order to seek political office.

Institutional barriers may also pose as a hindrance for balancing a political career and family. For instance, in Canada, Members of Parliament do not contribute to Employment Insurance; therefore, they are not entitled to paternity benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parliament of Canada|title=40th Parliament, 3rd  Session|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=4694765#TOC-TS-1150|work=October 18, 2010|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Such lack of parental leave would undoubtedly be a reason for women to delay seeking electoral office. Furthermore, mobility plays a crucial role in the work-family dynamic. Elected officials are usually required to commute long distances to and from their respective capital cities, which can be a deterrent for women seeking political office.

==Policies to increase women's participation==
The United Nations has identified six avenues by which female participation in politics and government may be strengthened. These avenues are: equalization of educational opportunities, quotas for female participation in governing bodies, legislative reform to increase focus on issues concerning women and children, financing gender-responsive budgets to equally take into account the needs of men and women, increasing the presence of sex-disaggregated statistics in national research/data, and furthering the presence and agency of grassroots women's [[empowerment]] movements.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

===Education===
Women with formal education (at any level) are more likely to delay marriage and subsequent childbirth, be better informed about infant and child nutrition, and ensure childhood immunization. Children of mothers with formal education are better nourished and have higher survival rates.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt; Education is a vital tool for any person in society to better themselves in their career path, and equalization of educational opportunities for boys and girls may take the form of several initiatives:

* abolishment of educational fees which would require parents to consider financial issues when deciding which of their children to educate. Poor children in rural areas are particularly affected by inequality resulting from educational fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = United Nations Children's Fund | last2 = World Bank | title = Building on what we know and defining sustained support | url = https://www.unicef.org/media/files/NAIROBI_AGENDA.pdf }} School Fee Abolition Initiative Workshop, organized by UNICEF and the World Bank, Nairobi, 5–7 April 2006, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* encouragement of parents and communities to institute gender-equal educational agendas. Perceived [[opportunity cost]] of educating girls may be addressed through a [[conditional cash transfer]] program which financially reward families who educate their daughters (thus removing the financial barrier that results from girls substituting school attendance for work in the family labor force).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bellamy | first = Carol | title = The state of the world's children, 2004: Girls' education And development | publisher = UNICEF | location = New York | year = 2003 | url = https://www.unicef.org/publications/index_18108.html | isbn = 9780756740214 }} [https://www.unicef.org/sowc04/files/SOWC_O4_eng.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*creation of "girl-friendly" schools to minimize bias and create a safe school environment for girls and young women. Currently, a barrier to female school attendance is the risk of [[sexual violence]] en route to school.&lt;ref name="Fund 2004"&gt;United Nations Children's Fund, The State of the World's Children 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; A "safe school environment" is one in which the school is located to minimize such violence, in addition to providing girls with educational opportunities (as opposed to using female students to perform janitorial work or other menial labor).&lt;ref name="Fund 2004"/&gt;

Jones, in reference to [[Pippa Norris|Norris's]] ''Legislative Recruitment'', states that: "Unlike other factors that have been identified as influencing the level of women's legislative representation, such as a country's political culture and level of economic development, institutional rules are relatively easy to change".&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Jones | first = Mark P. | title = Gender quotas, electoral laws, and the election of women: lessons from the Argentine provinces | journal = [[Comparative Political Studies]] | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–21 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0010414098031001001 | date = February 1998 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0010414098031001001 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article about the exclusion of Women from politics in southern Africa, Amanda Gouws said "The biggest hurdles to overcome for women are still on the local level where both men and women are often recruited from the communities and have limited political skills".&lt;ref name="Amanda"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gouws | first = Amanda | title = Changing women's exclusion from politics: examples from Southern Africa | journal = [[African and Asian Studies]] | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 537–563 | publisher = [[Brill Publishers]] | doi = 10.1163/156921008X359650 | date = 2008 | url = https://doi.org/10.1163/156921008X359650 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of education in these local governments or, for that matter, the people in those positions of power, are substandard.

One example of the hurdles women face in receiving good education comes from Beijing. "Most women who attended the [[NGO]] Forums accompanying the [[UN]] conferences, which are for government delegations (though increasingly many governments include activists and [[NGO]] members among their official delegates), were middle-class educated women from [[INGO|INGOS]], donors, academics, and activists".&lt;ref name="Manisha"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Desai | first = Manisha | title = Transnationalism: the face of feminist politics post-Beijing | journal = International Social Science Journal | volume = 57 | issue = 184 | pages = 319–330 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2451.2005.553.x | date = June 2005 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2451.2005.553.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lydia Kompe, a well-known South African activist, was one of these rural women. She noted that she felt overwhelmed and completely disempowered. In the beginning, she did not think she could finish her term of office because of her lack of education.&lt;ref name="Amanda" /&gt; Manisha Desai explains that: "There is an inequality simply around the fact that the [[UN]] system and its locations say a lot about the current focus of those systems, such positions being in the US and Western Europe allow easier access to those women in the area.&lt;ref name="Manisha" /&gt; It is also important to note that institutions affect the cultural propensity to elect women candidates in different ways in different parts of the world."&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt;

The study of the history of women's representation has been a major contribution in helping scholars view such concepts. [[Andrew Reynolds (political scientist)|Andrew Reynolds]] states: "historical experience often leads to gender advancement, and political liberalization enables women to mobilize within the public sphere".&lt;ref name="Andrew"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Reynolds | first = Andrew | author-link = Andrew Reynolds (political scientist) | title = Women in the legislatures and executives of the world: knocking at the highest glass ceiling | journal = [[World Politics]] | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | pages = 547–572 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] | doi = 10.1017/S0043887100009254 | date = July 1999 | url = https://doi.org/10.1017/S0043887100009254 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that we will see a larger number of women in higher office positions in established democracy than in democracies that are developing, and "the more illiberal a state is, the fewer women will be in positions of power".&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt;  As countries open education systems to women, and more women participate in historically male dominated fields, it is possible to see a shift in political views regarding women in government.

===Quotas===
{{further2|[[All-women shortlists]], a UK policy for electoral gender-parity}}

[[File:TRS ballot papers.svg|thumb|Example of a TRS ballot papers]]
Quotas are explicit requirements on the number of women in political positions.&lt;ref name="Fund 2004"/&gt; "Gender quotas for the election of legislators have been used since the late 1970s by a few political parties (via the party charter) in a small number of advanced industrial democracies; such examples would be like [[Germany]] and [[Norway]]".&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; [[Andrew Reynolds (political scientist)|Andrew Reynolds]] says there is "an increasing practice in legislatures for the state, or the parties themselves, to utilize formal or informal quota mechanisms to promote women as candidates and [[Member of Parliament|MPs]]".&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt;  The statistics surrounding quota systems have been examined thoroughly by academia.

Types of quotas include:&lt;ref name="Fund 2004" /&gt;
* Sex quota systems: institute a "critical value" below which is deemed an imbalanced government. Examples of such critical values include 20% of legislators, 50%{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} of politicians, etc.
* Legal quota systems regulate the governance of political parties and bodies. Such quotas may be mandated by electoral law (as the [[Argentine quota law]], for example) or may be constitutionally required (as in Nepal).
* Voluntary party quota systems may be used by [[political parties]] at will, yet are not mandated by electoral law or by a country's constitution. If a country's leading or majority political party engages in a voluntary party quota system, the effect may "trickle down" to minority political parties in the country (as in the case of the African National Congress in South Africa).
Quotas may be utilized during different stages of the political nomination/selection process to address different junctures at which women may be inherently disadvantaged:&lt;ref name="Fund 2004"/&gt;
* Potential candidacy: sex quota systems can mandate that from the pool of aspirants, a certain percentage of them must be female.
* Nomination: legal or voluntary quotas are enforced upon this stage, during which a certain portion of nominated candidates on the party's ballot must be female.
* Election: "reserved seats" may be filled only by women.
Quota usage can have marked effects on female representation in governance. In 1995, Rwanda ranked 24th in terms of female representation, and jumped to 1st in 2003 after quotas were introduced. Similar effects can be seen in Argentina, Iraq, Burundi, Mozambique, and South Africa, for example.&lt;ref name="Fund 2004"/&gt; Of the top-ranked 20 countries in terms of female representation in government, 17 of these countries utilize some sort of quota system to ensure female inclusion. Though such inclusion is mainly instituted at the national level, there have been efforts in India to addresses female inclusion at the subnational level, through quotas for parliamentary positions.&lt;ref name="IPU_class"&gt;''See'':
* {{cite web | title = Women in Parliaments: World classification | url = http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm | website = ipu.org | publisher = [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] }}
* and {{cite web | title = Global Database of Quotas for Women: Country overview | url = http://www.quotaproject.org/country.cfm?SortOrder=LastLowerPercenta | website = quotaproject.org | publisher = [[International IDEA]], [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] and [[Stockholm University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With quotas drastically changing the number of female representatives in political power, a bigger picture unravels. Though countries are entitled to regulate their own laws, the quota system helps explain social and cultural institutions and their understandings and overall view of women in general. "At first glance, these shifts seem to coincide with the adoption of candidate gender quotas around the globe as quotas have appeared in countries in all major world regions with a broad range of institutional, social, economic and cultural characteristics".&lt;ref name="6Krook"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Krook | first = Mona Lena | title = Reforming representation: the diffusion of candidate gender quotas worldwide | journal = [[Politics &amp; Gender]] | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 303–327 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] | doi = 10.1017/S1743923X06060107 | date = September 2006 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1743923X06060107 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quotas have been quite useful in allowing women to gain support and opportunities when attempting to achieve seats of power, but some see this as a wrongdoing. [[Drude Dahlerup]] and Lenita Freidenvall argue this in their article "Quotas as a 'Fast Track' to Equal Representation for Women" by stating: "From a liberal perspective, quotas as a specific group right conflict with the principle of equal opportunity for all. Explicitly favoring certain groups of citizens, i.e. women, means that not all citizens (men) are given an equal chance to attain a political career".&lt;ref name=5Dahlerup&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dahlerup | first1 = Drude | last2 = Freidenvall | first2 = Lenita | title = Quotas as a "fast track"  to equal political representation for women: why Scandinavia is no longer the model | journal = [[International Feminist Journal of Politics]] | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 26–48 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/1461674042000324673 | date = 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1461674042000324673 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahlerup and Freidenvall claim that even though quotas create theoretical imbalance in opportunity for men and that they necessarily break the concept of "classical liberal notion of equality",&lt;ref name="5Dahlerup" /&gt; quotas are almost required to bring the relation of women in politics to a higher state, whether that is through equal opportunity or just equal results.&lt;ref name="5Dahlerup" /&gt; "According to this understanding of women's under-representation, mandated quotas for the recruitment and election of female candidates, possibly also including time-limit provisions, are needed".&lt;ref name="5Dahlerup" /&gt;

The introduction of gender quotas in the electoral process has spurred controversy from male politicians, resulting in resistance to the acceptance of quotas in the political realm.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;Krook, Mona. “Contesting gender quotas: dynamics of resistance.” Politics, Groups, and Identities, vol. 4, no. 2, 2016. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21565503.2016.1151797?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true. Accessed 25 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The mobilization of women in politics has been hindered by means of preserving male political survival, and to avoid political interference with male power and domination.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; Moreover, the implementation of gender quotas has caused the male candidate population to decrease in order for their female counterparts to participate, and this is commonly referred to as the “negative sum,” and this can result in a more qualified male being rejected to allow a female politician to participate.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; Furthermore, in the case of Argentina, which is currently mandated for a 30% female party at each level of government, saw the introduction of the 'quota women'; females that were less experienced, and only elected due to the legal requirement of quotas.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"&gt;Franceschet, Susan, and Jennifer M. Piscopo. “Gender Quotas and Women's Substantive Representation: Lessons from Argentina.” Politics &amp;Amp; Gender, vol. 4, no. 3, 2008, pp. 393–425., doi:10.1017/S1743923X08000342.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the 'quota women' has triggered what political scientists refer to as a 'mandate effect,' where quota women feel obligated to represent solely the interests of the female public.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; Moreover, in order to preserve male political survival, “domination techniques” have been utilized to both exclude and delegitimize female representation in politics, and this can be depicted in the case of Argentina, where it took several elections to gain 35% of female representatives.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; With the increase of female representation in Argentina, issues that were rarely discussed before became paramount in debates, such as “penal laws, sexual assault laws, and laws on maternity leave and pregnancy… sexual education, [and] emergency contraceptive.”

Substantive representation contains two distinct parts: both the process and outcome of having female politicians.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; Substantive representation based on the process is concerned with the gendered perspective, themes that female representatives discuss in political debates, and the impact they have on the creation of bills.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; Likewise, this process also includes the networking between women in government and female organizations.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; Substantive representation by outcome relates to the success of passing legislation that enables gender equality to both public and private issues.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; Moreover, substantive representation as process does not always result in substantive representation by outcome; the implementation of gender quotas and female representation does not directly instigate an influx in legislation.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt;

Critical mass theory has correlations with both substantive representation as process and substantive representation as outcome. Critical mass theory suggests that once a certain percentage of women representatives has been reached, that female legislators will be able to create and enable transformative policies, and this has the potential to place pressure on quota women to act on behalf of all women.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; One paramount criticism of critical mass theory is its attention to numbers, and the understanding that quota women are to represent women collectively.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; Furthermore, the representation of women as a collective group remains controversial, as “[if] she is a white straight, middle-class mother, she cannot speak for African-American women, or poor women, or lesbian women on the basis of her own experience anymore than men can speak for women merely on the basis of theirs.”&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt;

A 2018 study in ''[[The Journal of Politics]]'' found that the implementation of electoral gender quotas which substantially increased women's representation in parliament led to increased government expenditures toward public health and relative decreases in military spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clayton|first=Amanda|last2=Zetterberg|first2=Pär|date=2018-05-10|title=Quota Shocks: Electoral Gender Quotas and Government Spending Priorities Worldwide|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/697251|journal=The Journal of Politics|language=en|pages=000–000|doi=10.1086/697251|issn=0022-3816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===
There have been numerous occasions where equal legislation has benefited the overall progression of women equality on a global scale. Though women have entered legislation, the overall representation within higher ranks of government is not being established. "Looking at ministerial positions broken down by portfolio allocation, one sees a worldwide tendency to place women in the softer [[sociocultural]] ministerial positions rather than in the harder and politically more prestigious positions of economic planning, national security, and foreign affairs, which are often seen as stepping-stones to national leader ship".&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt;

Legislative agendas, some pushed by female political figures, may focus on several key issues to address ongoing gender disparities:
* Reducing domestic and gender-based violence. The Convention on the Rights of the Child, published by the United Nations in 1989, addressed home violence and its effects on children. The Convention stipulates that children are holders of human rights, and authorizes the State to 1) prevent all forms of violence, and 2) respond to past violence effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = United Nations | title = Report of the independent expert for the United Nations study on violence against children – UN A/61/150 and Corr. 1 (provisional version) | url = https://disarmament-library.un.org/UNODA/Library.nsf/f860ad0cf3d61a518525711f006bb390/bba1dc9d335cbb1d852571b5005188c7/$FILE/agenda61.150.pdf | publisher = United Nations | location = New York | date = 23 August 2005 }}

It calls for "all parties of armed conflict to take special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = United Nations | title =  Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000), para. 10, adopted by the Security Council at its 4213th meeting | url = https://www.un.org/press/en/2000/20001031.sc6942.doc.html | publisher = United Nations | location = New York | date = 31 October 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Reducing in-home discrimination through equalizing [[property]] and [[inheritance]]  rights. National legislation can supersede traditionally male-dominated inheritance models. Such legislation has been proven effective in countries like Colombia, where 60% of land is held in joint titles between men and women (compared to 18% before the passage of joint titling legislation in 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mason | first1 = Andrew D. | last2 = King | first2 = Elizabeth M. | contribution = Social norms, laws, and economic institutions: rights and laws (land rights) | editor-last1 = Mason | editor-first1 = Andrew D. | editor-last2 = King | editor-first2 = Elizabeth M. | title = Engendering development through gender equality in rights, resources, and voice: A World Bank policy research report | url = http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/512911468327401785/Engendering-development-through-gender-equality-in-rights-resources-and-voice | page = 120 | publisher = World Bank and Oxford University Press | location = Washington DC | date = January 2001 | isbn = 9780195215960 }} [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PGLP/Resources/Engendering_Development.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financing===
Sex-responsive budgets address the needs and interests of different individuals and social groups, maintaining awareness of sexual equality issues within the formation of policies and budgets. Such budgets are not necessarily a 50–50 male-female split, but accurately reflect the needs of each sex (such as increased allocation for women's reproductive health.&lt;ref name="United Nations Development Programme 2005"&gt;{{cite web | last =United Nations | title = Gender-responsive budgeting: manual for trainers | url = http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/ourwork/povertyreduction/focus_areas/focus_gender_and_poverty/gender-responsiveplanningandbudgeting.html | publisher = United Nations Development Programme | location = Bratislava | year = 2005 }} [https://www.ndi.org/sites/default/files/Gender%20Responsive%20Budgeting%20Trainers%20Manual.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits of gender-responsive budgets include:
* Improved budget efficiency by ensuring that funds are allocated where they are needed most
* Strengthened government position by advocating for needs of all, including the poor and the underrepresented rights
* Increased information flow surrounding needs of those who are usually discriminated against
A sex-responsive budget may also work to address issues of unpaid care work and caring labor gaps.&lt;ref name="United Nations Development Programme 2005"/&gt;

===Research/data improvements===
Current research which uses sex-aggregated statistics may underplay or minimize the quantitative presentation of issues such as maternal mortality, violence against women, and girls' school attendance.&lt;ref name="unicef.org" /&gt; Sex-disaggregated statistics are lacking in the assessment of maternal mortality rates, for example. Prior to [[UNICEF]] and [[UNIFEM]] efforts to gather more accurate and comprehensive data, 62 countries had no recent national data available regarding maternal mortality rates.&lt;ref name="United Nations 2006"&gt;{{citation | last = United Nations | contribution = Chapter 2: Health | editor-last = United Nations | title = The world's women 2005: progress in statistics | page = 26 | publisher = [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] | location = New York | year = 2006 | url = https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/indwm/wwpub.htm | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/indwm/ww2005_pub/English/WW2005_chpt_2_Health_BW.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Only 38 countries have sex-disaggregated statistics available to report frequency of violence against women.&lt;ref name="United Nations 2006" /&gt; 41 countries collect sex-disaggregated data on school attendance, while 52 countries assess sex-disaggregated wage statistics.&lt;ref name="United Nations 2006"/&gt;

Though the representation has become a much larger picture, it is important to notice the inclination of political activity emphasizing women over the years in different countries. "Although women's representation in [[Latin America]], [[Africa]], and [[Western culture|the West]] progressed slowly until 1995, in the most recent decade, these regions show substantial growth, doubling their previous percentage".&lt;ref name="Paxton" /&gt;

Researching politics on a global scale does not just reinvent ideas of politics, especially towards women, but brings about numerous concepts. Sheri Kunovich and Pamela Paxton research method, for example, took a different path by studying "cross-national" implications to politics, taking numerous countries into consideration. This approach helps identify research beforehand that could be helpful in figuring out commodities within countries and bringing about those important factors when considering the overall representation of women. "At the same time, we include information about the inclusion of women in the political parties of each country".&lt;ref name="Kunovich" /&gt; Research within gender and politics has taken a major step towards a better understanding of what needs to be better studied. Dr. Mona L. Krook states: These kinds of studies help establish that generalizing countries together is far too limiting to the overall case that we see across countries and that we can take the information we gain from these studies that look at countries separately and pose new theories as to why countries have the concepts they do; this helps open new reasons and thus confirms that studies need to be performed over a much larger group of factors.&lt;ref name=7Krook&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Krook | first = Mona Lena | title = Candidate gender quotas: a framework for analysis | journal = [[European Journal of Political Research]] | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 367–394 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-6765.2007.00704.x | date = May 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-6765.2007.00704.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.mlkrook.org/pdf/ejpr_07.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Authors and researchers such as Mala Htun and Laurel Weldon also state that single comparisons of established and developed countries is simply not enough but is also surprisingly hurtful to the progress of this research, they argue that focusing on a specific country "tends to duplicate rather than interrogate" the overall accusations and concepts we understand when comparing political fields.&lt;ref name=Htun&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Htun | first1 = Mala | last2 = Weldon | first2 = S.

* Modified version also [http://thedemocracypapers.ssrc.org/the-politics-of-policies-to-promote-gender-justice/ available online].&lt;/ref&gt; They continue by explaining that comparative politics has not established sex equality as a major topic of discussion among countries.&lt;ref name="Htun" /&gt; This research challenges the current standings as to what needs to be the major focus in order to understand gender in politics.

A 2018 study in the ''American Economic Journal: Economic Policy'' found that for German local elections "female council candidates advance more from their initial list rank when the mayor is female. This effect spreads to neighboring municipalities and leads to a rising share of female council members."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baskaran|first=Thushyanthan|last2=Hessami|first2=Zohal|date=August 2018|title=Does the Election of a Female Leader Clear the Way for More Women in Politics?|url=https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/pol.20170045|journal=American Economic Journal: Economic Policy|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=95–121|doi=10.1257/pol.20170045|issn=1945-7731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grassroots women's empowerment movements===
[[File:The lady in the case.jpg|thumb|The lady in the case, an example of how some have interpreted women's involvement in government]]
Women's informal collectives are crucial to improving the standard of living for women worldwide. Collectives can address such issues as nutrition, education, shelter, food distribution, and generally improved standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = McNulty | first = Stephanie | title = Women's organizations during and after war: from service delivery to policy advocacy | page = 3 | publisher = Center for Development Information and Evaluation, [[United States Agency for International Development|US Agency for International Aid]] | location = Washington, DC | date = 2 October 1998 | url = http://genderandsecurity.org/projects-resources/research/womens-organizations-during-and-after-war-service-delivery-policy | ref = harv | postscript = .}} Document ref: PN-ACD-336. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.511.2415&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Empowering such collectives can increase their reach to the women most in need of support and empowerment. Though women's movements have a very successful outcome with the emphasis on gaining equality towards women, other movements are taking different approaches to the issue. Women in certain countries, instead of approaching the demands as representation of women as "a particular interest group", have approached the issue on the basis of the "[[Universality (philosophy)|universality]] of sex differences and the relation to the nation".&lt;ref name="Htun" /&gt; Htun and Weldon also bring up the point of democracy and its effects on the level of equality it brings. In their article, they explain that a democratic country is more likely to listen to "[[autonomous]] organizing" within the government. Women's movements would benefit from this the most or has had great influence and impact because of [[democracy]], though it can become a very complex system.&lt;ref name="Htun" /&gt; When it comes to local government issues, political standings for women are not necessarily looked upon as a major issue. "Even civil society organizations left women's issues off the agenda. At this level, traditional leaders also have a vested interest that generally opposes women's interests".&lt;ref name="Amanda" /&gt; Theorists believe that having a setback in government policies would be seen as catastrophic to the overall progress of women in government. Amanda Gouws says that "The instability of democratic or nominally democratic [[regimes]] makes women's political gains very vulnerable because these gains can be easily rolled back when regimes change. The failure to make the private sphere part of political contestation diminishes the power of formal democratic rights and limits solutions to gender inequality".&lt;ref name="Amanda" /&gt; .

=== Australia ===
''Further information: [[Women and government in Australia|Women and Government in Australia]]''

In 1902, [[Australia]] became the first country to give some women the vote and allow them to stand for Parliament. This did not apply to [[Aboriginal Australians]], including women, until the amendment of the [[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918|Electoral Act]] in 1962. It wasn’t until 1983 that Indigenous people had voting rights entirely equal to white Australians when another amendment made enrollment to vote compulsory, rather than voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Senate_Briefs/Brief03|title=No. 3 - Women in the Senate|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19 years after the [[Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902|Commonwealth Franchise Act]] was passed, [[Edith Cowan]] was elected to Legislative Assembly and became the first woman ever elected in any Australian Parliament.

In [[History of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]], placing women in government has progressed better than in other [[Islamic countries]].  Universal suffrage was introduced in [[Azerbaijan]] in 1918 by the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], thus making Azerbaijan the first [[Muslim-majority countries]] and Turk-majority countries ever to enfranchise women. Now, 28 women are members in the [[Azerbaijan Parliament]] ([[Milli Məclis]]). As of 2015, there were 21 women in the 125-seat parliament. The percentage of female members of parliament increased from 11 to 17 percent between 2005 and 2015. Traditional social norms and lagging economic development in the country's rural regions continued to restrict the role of women in the economy, and there were reports that women had difficulty exercising their legal rights due to gender discrimination. As of May 2009, women held the positions of Deputy Chairman of the Constitutional Court, Deputy Chairman of the Nakhchivan AR Cabinet of Ministers, four Deputy Ministers, an Ambassador, and Ombudsmen of [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] AR. Women constituted 4 of the 16 members of the Central Election Commission and chaired of 3 of the 125 district election commissions. Some famous female managers in historical [[Azerbaijan]] territories mentioned below:
* [[Tomyris]] – antic women leader of [[Scythians]], was born in near of [[Araks River]]

===Brazil===
A 1995 Brazilian gender quota was extended first to city councilor positions in 1996, then extended to candidates of all political legislative positions by 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sacchet | first = Teresa | title = Beyond numbers: the impact of gender quotas in Latin America | journal = [[International Feminist Journal of Politics]] | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 369–386 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/14616740802185700 | date = 2008 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/14616740802185700 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1998, 30% of political candidates had to be women, with varied results in terms of the gender balance of the officials ultimately elected. Though the percentage of national legislature seats occupied by women dropped in the initial years following the passage of the quota law, the percentage has since risen (from 6.2% pre-quota, to 5.7% in 1998, to 8.9% in 2006). However, Brazil has struggled with the quota law in several respects:
* Though the quota law mandates a certain percentage of candidate spots be reserved for women, it is not compulsory that those spots be filled by women.
* The quota law also allowed political parties to increase the number of candidates, further increasing electoral competition and having a negligible impact on the actual number of women elected.

=== China ===
China's stipulation for gender equality in the political sphere started on as early as recorded in its 1954 Constitution, in which the PRC government stated that men and women enjoy equal rights in the aspects of political, economic, cultural, social and family dimensions, especially highlighting legitimate voting right and the right to be elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guo|first=Xiajuan|date=January 2008|title=The rise of affirmative action|url=https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/iaps/documents/cpi/briefings/briefing-34-women-political-participation.pdf|journal=WOMEN'S POLITICAL PARTICIPATION IN CHINA|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another State document – Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Woman – also outlined an official requirement of 'appropriate number of women deputies', combined with the State's obligations to 'gradually increase the proportion of the women deputies' and 'actively trains and selects female cadres' in fundamental national institutions and political organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/government/207405.htm|title=Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women|last=|first=|date=|website=www.china.org.cn|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; For decades that follow, China has been making revision to its constitutional laws and State announcements to give recognition to  women's role in the domain of governance. An example of which is the proclamation issued on the 5th meeting session of the 10th National People's Congress (NPC) necessitating that 'the proportion of women delegates to be elected to the 11th People's Congress should be no less than 20%'.

However, regardless of the proper representation of women's political eligibility across multiple government declarations, the political system in China remains overwhelmingly male-dominated which in turns drives the low engagement rate of women delegates. Despite the new 13th NPC lineup with a composition of 742 women out of 2,980 representatives, which amounts to 24.9% penetration with 1.5 points increase as opposed to the former term,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-02/24/c_136997333.htm|title=More women, fewer officials on China's top legislature – Xinhua {{!}} English.news.cn|website=www.xinhuanet.com|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is mere presence of women in the central power structure in major government organs and their political influences are vastly diminished as they climb up the political ladder. Justifications of the above statement include the fact that only 33 women (9%) are recorded to have a seat at the table of Central Committee for the election of members into the Politburo, a key cornerstone for the approval all national affairs.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41652487|title=Reality Check: Are women welcome in Chinese politics?|date=2017-10-25|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, except for the two consecutive office in 1973 and 1977, the Central Committee has never witnessed over 10% of women engagement in the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=ZQMtDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=-+With+the+exception+of+the+10th+Party+Congress+in+1973+and+the+11th+Party+Congress+in+1977,+women+have+never+made+up+more+than+10+percent+of+the+total+membership+of+the+Central+Committee.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-wRi5Wu_TB&amp;sig=nh4Ec2KLGA-hVTYf8RbM5Q5NLSk&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjh_I29_8bZAhVMk5QKHRYZDgcQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=-%20With%20the%20exception%20of%20the%2010th%20Party%20Congress%20in%201973%20and%20the%2011th%20Party%20Congress%20in%201977,%20women%20have%20never%20made%20up%20more%20than%2010%20percent%20of%20the%20total%20membership%20of%20the%20Central%20Committee.&amp;f=false|title=Young China: How the Restless Generation Will Change Their Country and the World|last=Dychtwald|first=Zak|date=2018-02-13|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=9781466891333|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Associated with the above figure is the decline in the 25-member Politburo from two women down to one. In addition, the recent reappointment of Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, has sparked controversy on the unbroken record of no-women Politburo Standing Committee and absence of female top leaders in any legislature in China's political history, apart from the exceptions of Vice Premier, Liu Yandong and Vice Foreign Minister, Fu Ying. The public has been compelled to draw parallel with Hong Kong and Taiwan where female presidents – Carrie Lam and Tsai Ing-wen – took office in 2018 and 2016 respectively.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/22/asia/china-female-leaders/index.html|title=Why China has so few female leaders|last=CNN|first=Yazhou Sun,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The male-heavy politics amidst the favorable women's right protection in China can be examined from the following underlying causes:

''(1) Deprivation of upward mobility''

While the implied prerequisite of national appointment is years of experience serving at middle-to-top management, women in the PRC government often struggle to obtain promotion to high-ranked positions, such as party secretary or principal governor.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The reason contributing to the captioned phenomenon is gender division of labor across all levels of political structures. Contrary to Mao Zedong's saying that 'Women hold up half of the sky', Confucians principles' deeply ingrained advocacy “nan zhu wai, nu zhu nei” (men working on the outside, women's place remains on the inside) has shaped gender division of labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feng|first=Xianghong|date=2013-07-01|title=Women's Work, Men's Work: Gender and Tourism among the Miao in Rural China|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/awr.12002/abstract|journal=Anthropology of Work Review|language=en|volume=34|issue=1|pages=2–14|doi=10.1111/awr.12002|issn=1548-1417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being assigned highly gender-biased responsibilities within the spectrum of 'women affairs', such as family planning that are reproduction-oriented or with connection to social construction, women's public role and scope of duty are framed under constraints. Women are, at the same time, missing the opportunities to keep a foothold in strategic national affairs, including but not limited to economic development, military planning and diplomatic involvement. The mentioned dilemma is reflected by an actual example in Ning Xiang County, Hunan Province. Women commonly maintain highest authority as Head in women-related bodies, administering concerns on women's unfair treatments and suggesting for children's health development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howell|first=Jude|date=January 2008|title=The representation of women in rural politics|url=|journal=Women's Political Participation in China: in whose interests elections?|volume=|pages=|via=Journal of Contemporary China}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the same token, the gendered portfolio gives rise to empowerment of male in the political hierarchal. Consequently, with the lack of exposure to the exemplary official posts and the exclusive offering of key national assignments for men, women's upward mobility is aggravated, resulting in the substantially dwindling likelihood of taking residence in key leading positions.

''(2) Biased retirement precondition prejudicing against women''

In China, there is an apparent discrepancy in the mandatory retirement age between men and women, in which men are entitled to enjoy 10 more years of work. This policy was established on the ground that women are primary and central support for domestic subjects and their early retirement (at the age of 50–55) would be beneficial to their overall family functioning.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This discriminatory policy mirrors the cause in the previous part, in which the working capacity of women is restricted by the society's stereotype on their gender role and corresponding gender responsibilities. In addition, the average age of Chinese chief in Central Committee is 56.1 years old; Top leaders in Politburo were appointed at an average age of 61.1 years old; Whereas Standing Committee of Politburo has the highest average age of 63.4 for its office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jinghan|first=Zeng|year=2014|title=Institutionalization of the authoritarian leadership in China: a power succession system with Chinese characteristics?|journal=[[Contemporary Politics]]|volume=20|issue=3|pages=294–314|doi=10.1080/13569775.2014.911502|via=[[ResearchGate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; All figures being examined, the aggregated average age of appointed leaders exceeds the legal retirement age of women in the nation, meaning that women are least likely to become the center of power before their career come to an end.

(3) ''Anti-feminism''

While in foreign countries, women's socio-economic status is uplifted and gender division of labor is largely wiped out by feminist movements to open up the availability and variety of work for women, the conservative and politically-sensitive Chinese government's censorship on feminism within the country has spread fear among feminism advocates. An illustrative case of which is the backlash of 'Feminist Five' in China. The activists suffered from interrogation, detention and month-long imprisonment due to the distribution of stickers on Beijing subways for drawing the wider community's awareness to sexual harassment against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/08/feminist-stickers-china-backash-women-activists|title=I went to jail for handing out feminist stickers in China {{!}} Li Maizi|last=Maizi|first=Li|date=2017-03-08|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Followed by the forced suspension of Weibo account 'Feminist Voices' due to the government's tightened censorship, feminist encountered escalated obstacles in promoting gender equality. Feminist movements are yet to achieve their goals.

===Finland===
The Finnish national quota law, introduced in 1995, mandates that among all indirectly elected public bodies (at both a national and a local level), neither sex in the governing body can be under 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Holli | first1 = Anne Maria | last2 = Luhtakallio | first2 = Eeva | last3 = Raevaara | first3 = Eeva | title = Quota trouble: talking about gender quotas in Finnish local politics | journal = [[International Feminist Journal of Politics]] | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–193 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/14616740600612822 | date = June 2006 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/14616740600612822 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://blogs.helsinki.fi/holli/files/2013/05/RFJP1612641.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1995 laws was a reformed version of a similar 1986 law. Unlike other countries' quota laws, which affect party structure or electoral candidate lists, the Finnish law addresses indirectly elected bodies (nominated by official authorities)—the law does not address popularly elected bodies. The Finnish law heavily emphasizes local municipal boards and other subnational institutions. From 1993 (pre-quota law) to 1997 (post-quota law), the proportion of women on municipal executive boards increased from 25% to 45%. The quota law also affected gender segregation in local governance: before the passage of the law, there had been a gender imbalance in terms of female overrepresentation in "soft-sector" boards (those concerned with health, education, etc.) and female "underrepresentation" in "hard-sector" boards (those concerned with economics and technology). In 1997, the boards were balanced horizontally. However, areas not subject to quota laws continue to be imbalanced. In 2003, it was determined that only 16% of the chairs of municipal executive boards are female—chair positions in this area are not quota-regulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pikkala | first = Sari | title = Representations of women in Finnish local government: effects of the 1995 gender quota legislation | year = 2000 }} Paper presented at the European Consortium on Political Research Joint Sessions of Workshops, Copenhagen, 14–19 April.
&lt;/ref&gt; Presidential elections were held in Finland on 16 January 2000, with a second round on 6 February;&lt;ref name=DN&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Nohlen | editor-first1 = Dieter | editor-last2 = Stöver | editor-first2 = Philip | editor-link1 = Dieter Nohlen | title = Elections in Europe: a data handbook | page = 606 | publisher = Nomos | location = Baden-Baden, Germany | year = 2010 | isbn = 9783832956097 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the result was a victory for [[Tarja Halonen]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]], who became the country's first female President.

===Germany===
	The gender quotas implemented across parties in Germany in the 1990s serve as a natural experiment for the effect of sub-national party political gender quotas on women participation. Davidson-Schmich (2006) notes, "the German case provides the variance needed to explain the successful (or failed) implementation of these political party quotas".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Davidson-Schmich | first = Louise K. | title = Implementation of political party gender quotas: evidence from the German Länder 1990–2000 | journal = [[Party Politics]] | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 211–232 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/1354068806061338 | date = March 2006 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/1354068806061338 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.564.1797&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's sixteen state legislatures, the Länder, feature a variety of party systems and varied numbers of potential female candidates. Germany is rated highly in its gender gap, but is an example of a developed country with a low percentage of female leadership in politics.
	Davidson-Schmich's study shows that there are many factors that influence how effective a political quota for women will be. Because Germany's quotas cover culturally diverse areas, Davidson-Schmich was able to see which cities best responded to the increase in women running for office. In her bivariate study, the quota was more successful when the city had a PR electoral system, when more women held inner-party and local political offices, and when there were more women in state-level executive offices. The quota was less successful in rural areas, areas with a large number of Catholic voters, electoral systems with a preferential system, in extremely competitive party systems, and with greater rates of legislative turnover. In her multivariate study of these regions, however, Davidson-Schmich narrowed these factors down even further to the most significant variables of: Catholicism and agricultural economics (Davidson-Schmich, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;228). This is very intriguing, and as she explains, "the success of voluntary gender quotas in the German states hinged not on the political structure of these Lander, but rather the willingness of within the system to act on the opportunities inherent in these structures" (Davidson-Schmich, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;228). Social factors and inherent gender discrimination are more important in the success of a female political quota than the structure of the quota itself.

Due to the randomized selection of cities who must enforce the reservation for women each election year, some cities have implemented the quota multiple times, once or never. This addresses the political discrimination of women at various levels: parties are forced to give women the opportunity to run, the women candidates are not disadvantaged by a male incumbent or general biases for male over female leadership, and the pool of women candidates is increased because of the guaranteed opportunity for female participation.&lt;ref name="Bhavnani, Rikhil 2009" /&gt;  The effects of the quota system in India have been studied by various researchers.

Given the opportunity to get a party ticket, create a platform and obtain the experience to run for a political position, women are much more likely to be able to overcome these hurdles in the future, even without the quota system in place.&lt;ref name="Bhavnani, Rikhil 2009"/&gt; The quota system has also affected policy choices.

However, while reservation did not make male villagers more sympathetic to the idea of female leaders, it caused them to recognize that women could lead. Moreover, the reservation policy significantly improved women's prospects in elections open to both sexes, but only after two rounds of reservation within the same village.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Beaman | first1 = Lori | last2 = Chattopadhyay | first2 = Raghabendra | last3 = Duflo | first3 = Esther | last4 = Pande | first4 = Rohini | last5 = Topalova | first5 = Petia | title = Powerful women: does exposure reduce bias? | journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] | volume = 124 | issue = 4 | pages = 1497–1540 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1162/qjec.2009.124.4.1497 | date = November 2009  | url = https://doi.org/10.1162/qjec.2009.124.4.1497 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://economics.mit.edu/files/3122 Pdf.]

===Japan===
Japan ranks 127 in the world for the number of women in national parliamentary worldwide as of March 2014, which is lower than that of 2013 in which Japan ranked at 122.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kyodo | author-link = Kyodo News | title = Japan falls to 127th global ranking of female lawmakers | url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/03/12/national/japan-falls-to-127th-global-ranking-of-female-lawmakers/ |work = [[The Japan Times]] | date = March 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 28, 2013, there are a total of 39 women in the House of Representatives out of 479 incumbents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Strength of political groups in the House of Representatives | url = http://www.shugiin.go.jp/internet/itdb_english.nsf/html/statics/english/strength.htm | website = shugiin.go.jp | publisher = The House of Representatives | location = Japan }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since the enactment of the modern [[Constitution of Japan|Japanese Constitution]] in 1947, Japanese women have been given the right to vote, and the new version of the constitution also allows for a more democratic form of government that guarantees women equality under the law. 
The first female cabinet member, [[Masa Nakayama]], was appointed as the Minister of Health and Welfare in Japan in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwdc.org/resources/timeline.htm|title=International Women's Democracy Center|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Until 1996, the electoral system for the House of Representatives was based on a single non-transferable vote in multi-member districts. That system was not conducive to women's advancement in public office because it promoted contestation between competing parties and rival candidates within the same party,{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} but overall, the new electoral system was introduced to reduce the excessive role of money and corruption in elections, which ultimately helped women who were running for public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Iwanaga | first= Kazuki | title = Women's political representation and electoral system in Japan }} 1st International Conference Women and Politics in Asia. Conference Paper. Halmstad: Halmstad University, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
In Japanese politics, the [[Koenkai|kōenkai]] is a major factor for a successful outcome of an election. The kōenkai, or "local support groups", serve as pipelines through which funds and other support are conveyed to legislators and through which the legislators can distribute favors to constituents in return. Because gaining support from these groups is usually based on personal connections, women's historically disadvantaged position in networking circles hurts their ability to run for public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Krauss | first1 = Ellis S. | last2 = Pekkanen | first2 = Robert J. | contribution = The kōenkai: origin and development of a vote-mobilization machine | editor-last1 = Krauss | editor-first1 = Ellis S. | editor-last2 = Pekkanen | editor-first2 = Robert J. | title = The rise and fall of Japan's LDP : political party organizations as historical institutions | pages = 32–33 | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780801476822 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1996, Japan adopted another new electoral system for the House of Representatives that combines single-seat districts with proportional representation. Out of 480 seats, 300 are contested in single seat constituencies. The other 180 members are elected through allocations to an electoral list submitted by each party. Candidates who lack a strong support system are listed on a party's proportional representation section. In the 2009 election, only two of eight female [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] members were elected from a single-seat district, which indicates that few female candidates have enough political support to win a single-seat election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Nakano | first =Yūko | title = Japan chair platform: among equals?

As for the future of women in politics in Japan, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe announced in his speech at the Japan National Press Club on April 19, 2013, that a major goal of his national growth strategy is "having no less than 30 per cent of leadership positions in all areas of society filled by women by 2020." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Speech on growth strategy by Prime Minister Shinzō Abe at the Japan National Press Club | url = http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/96_abe/statement/201304/19speech_e.html | website = .kantei.go.jp | publisher = Prime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet | date = April 19, 2013 }} (Speeches and Statements by Prime Minister.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Demonstrating women.jpg|thumb|Lebanese women marching for their rights]]
Lebanese women are considered to have more rights and freedom compared to other women in the Gulf and Middle East.{{By whom|date=June 2017}} Women in Lebanon are able to dress more liberally and move around with relative ease in certain parts of the country, unlike other countries in the region. Lebanese women enjoy almost equal civil rights as men. However, due to the large number of officially recognized religions in Lebanon, Lebanese family matters are governed by at least 15 personal statute codes. Lebanese women have legal protection that varies depending on their religion.

Local and regional NGOs have helped to increase awareness of violence against women in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lnf.org.lb/windex/introduction.html|title=Women's Rights Monitor|date=|publisher=Lnf.org.lb|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Local-News/2012/Mar-25/167921-over-30-ngos-demonstrate-for-womens-rights.ashx#axzz1rcyhFq4K|title=Over 30 NGOs demonstrate for women's rights|date=|publisher=The Daily Star|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government policies regarding this are poor however, and attempts to improve this area have been met with resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report/95033/LEBANON-Tussle-over-gender-violence-law|title=IRIN Middle East &amp;#124; Lebanon: Tussle over gender violence law &amp;#124; Lebanon &amp;#124; Early Warning &amp;#124; Gender Issues &amp;#124; Governance &amp;#124; Human Rights &amp;#124; Security|date=2012-03-08|publisher=Irinnews.org|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lebanon's laws do not recognize the concept of spousal rape,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genderindex.org/country/lebanon|title=Gender Equality in Lebanon &amp;#124; Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI)|date=|publisher=Genderindex.org|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempts to add this to law have been attacked by Lebanese clerics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arabnews.com/middleeast/article462177.ece|title=Lebanon's clerics attack domestic violence law|last=Miller|first=David E.|accessdate=February 4, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630135532/http://arabnews.com/middleeast/article462177.ece|archivedate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Netherlands ===
In 2016, the Dutch government achieved their goal for women in top jobs within the government. A 30% female share was achieved two years earlier than anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/politiek/rijksoverheid-haalt-streefcijfer-vrouwen-in-topfuncties~a4302524/|title=Rijksoverheid haalt streefcijfer vrouwen in topfuncties – Politiek – Voor nieuws, achtergronden en columns|last=Giebels|first=Robert|website=De Volkskrant|language=nl-NL|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In business, the number of women in top jobs is behind in the political sector. In 2013, the listed companies inserted a 'one in three' rule, which meant that of every three top jobs, one must be exerted by a woman. Not long after, it turned out companies did not put much effort in to achieving this goal, as in practice even less than one in every ten top jobs was occupied by women. The goal for women in top jobs was postponed to 2023. Government and the business sector agreed that if every one in five top jobs is not exerted by women, after 2018 the 30% rule will become mandatory.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Bakker, F. S., &amp; Kartner, F. (2013). Excuustruus of echte topvrouw? Over de wenselijkheid van vrouwenquota in het bedrijfsleven. Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, women's quota received a fair share of criticism. It has been argued that women should be employed based on their own qualities, not because of their gender.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Romania===
No political gender quotas exist in Romania, however the Equality Act of 2002 provides that public authorities and institutions, political parties, employers' organizations and trade unions must provide an equitable and balanced representation of men and women at all decisional levels.&lt;ref&gt;Current legal framework: {{cite web | url=http://www.impowr.org/research/romania/Participation%20in%20policy%20formation%20and%20implementation | title=Participation in policy formation and implementation in Romania | website = impowr.org | publisher = International Models Project on Women's Rights (IMPOWR) | accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Romanian legislative election, 2016|2016 elections]], women gained only 20.7% of seats in the Lower House ([[Chamber of Deputies (Romania)|Romanian Chamber of Deputies]]) and 14.7% in the Upper House ([[Senate of Romania]]).&lt;ref name="IPU_class" /&gt; These figures are up from the 4.9% of women in the Romanian Parliament in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.roaep.ro/prezentare/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/women_Parliament.pdf | title=The evolution of woman representation in Romanian Parliament | website = roaep.ro | publisher= Romania Autoritatea Electorala Permanenta [Permanent Electoral Authority] | date = February 2013 | accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, women are well represented in the central public administration, including the [[Government of Romania|Government]], with more than half of decision-making positions held by women, according to a 2011 study commissioned by the [[Ministry of Labor, Family, and Social Protection (Romania)|Ministry of Labor]].&lt;ref&gt;Role of traditions: {{cite web | url=http://www.impowr.org/research/romania/Participation%20in%20policy%20formation%20and%20implementation | title=Participation in policy formation and implementation in Romania | website = impowr.org | publisher = International Models Project on Women's Rights (IMPOWR) | accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rwanda===
	Since the election of 2008, Rwanda is the first country to have a majority of women in legislature.&lt;ref name="Abbott"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Abbott | first1 = Pamela | last2 = Haerpfer | first2 = Christian | last3 = Wallace | first3 = Claire | author-link1 = Pamela Abbott | title = Women in Rwandan politics and society | journal = [[International Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 111–125 | doi = 10.2753/IJS0020-7659380406 | date = Winter 2008  |url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2753/IJS0020-7659380406 | publisher = M.

After the genocide that killed 800,000 Tutsis in 100 days, women in legislature went from 18% women before the conflict to 56% in 2008. Two pieces of legislature enabled and supported women into leadership positions: the Security Council Resolution of 1325 urged women to take part in the post-conflict reconstruction and the 2003 Rwandan Constitution included a mandated quota of 30% reserved seats for all women in legislature. Of the 24 women who gained seats directly after the quota implementation in 2003, many joined political parties and chose to run again. Though it took almost 10 years, after implementing the gender quotas, Rwanda reached levels of female representation which are amongst the highest in the world.&lt;ref name="Carmichael" /&gt; Once again we can see the quota working as an "incubator" for driving women's participation in leadership.

It is argued that the increase of female leadership in Rwanda also led to an increase in gender equality. World Focus (2009) writes, "Rwandan voters have elected women in numbers well beyond the mandates dictated by the post-genocide constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The top ten innovative global solutions of the decade (blog) | url = http://worldfocus.org/blog/2009/12/30/the-top-10-innovative-global-solutions-of-the-decade/8991/ | website = worldfocus.org | publisher = Worldfocus | date = December 30, 2009 | access-date = September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; And though women in Rwanda still face discrimination, female legislators have influenced major reforms in banking and property laws." A parliamentary women's caucus in Rwanda (FFRP) has also "led a successful effort to pass ground-breaking legislation on gender-based violence in part by involving and garnering support from their male colleagues".&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;

While some researchers see reform, others see dominant party tactics. Hassim (2009) writes, "It could be argued that in both countries [Uganda and Rwanda] women's representation provided a kind of alibi for the progressive, 'democratic' nature of new governments that at their core nevertheless remained authoritarian, and increasingly so".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Hassim | first = Shireen | contribution = Perverse consequences?

===Spain===
In 2007, Spain passed the Equality Law, requiring a "principle of balanced presence" by mandating political parties to include 40–60% of each sex among electoral candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Verge | first = Tània | title = Gendering representation in Spain: opportunities and limits of gender quotas | journal = [[Journal of Women, Politics &amp; Policy]] | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 166–190 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/15544771003697247 | date = 2010 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/15544771003697247 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law is unique in that surpasses the 40% parity figure established by the European Commission in 1998; a figure which (according to the EC) indicates "parity democracy." Though there is anecdotal evidence of increasing female representation on a local and national level, there has not yet been national-level data to quantitatively bolster this assertion.

On June 6, 2018, Pedro Sánchez, the leader of the Spanish Socialist Party, presented his cabinet which included eleven women and six men, making it the cabinet with the highest proportion of women in the world at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20180606/gobierno-mujeres-europeista-experiencia-gestion-independientes-fotografia-del-nuevo-gabinete/1746182.shtml|title=Gobierno de Pedro Sánchez: El Gobierno de las mujeres|date=6 June 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States no political gender quotas exist, mandatory or voluntary. The proportion of women in leadership roles in the Senate, House of Representatives, and Presidential positions reflect this. Although the proportion has grown since the first female elected into the Senate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lieber|first1=Constance |last2=Sillitos |first2=John |title= Martha Hughes Cannon |url=http://historytogo.utah.gov/people/marthahughescannon.html|website=Utah History To Go|publisher=Utah State Historical Society|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the current position of women representation in the U.S. is precarious. In the elections of 2012, the greatest number of female incumbents ever were up for re-election in the Senate. Ten female Democrats, six of them incumbents, were nominated, with one Republican nominated for Senate ran for office.&lt;ref name="Steinhauer, Jennifer 2011"&gt;{{cite news | last = Steinhauer | first = Jennifer | author-link = Jennifer Steinhauer | title = More women in Senate, but seats are at risk | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/us/politics/women-could-have-banner-year-in-2012-election.html | work = [[The New York Times|New York Times Journal]] | date = October 20, 2011 | location = New York, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steinhauer notes that in Congress, both in the Senate and the House of Representatives, women historically and currently lack representation.

From 1917, when Representative Jeannette Rankin of Montana became the first woman to serve in Congress, to the 115th congress, a total of 329 women have served as U.S. Representatives, Delegates, or Senators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://history.house.gov/wic/|title=Women in Congress {{!}} US House of Representatives: History, Art &amp; Archives|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1917 to 2018, the United States has had 277 women serve in the House of Representatives.

From 1922, when Senator Rebecca Latimer Felton became the first woman to serve in the Senate, to 2018 52 women have served in the United States Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/women_senators.htm|title=U.S. Senate: Women in the Senate|website=www.senate.gov|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 115th Congress, 107 (78D, 29R) women hold seats in the United States Congress, comprising 20.0% of the 535 members; 23 women (23%) serve in the U.S. Senate, and 84 women (19.3%) serve in the U.S. House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/women-us-congress-2018|title=Women in the U.S. Congress 2018|date=2015-06-12|work=CAWP|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States is one of the shrinking number of industrialized democracies to not have yet had a woman as its leader. Worldwide, female prime ministers include Canada's [[Kim Campbell]], the UK's [[Margaret Thatcher]], Australia's [[Julia Gillard]], Israel's [[Golda Meir]], and France's [[Édith Cresson]]. Other female national leaders include Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] of Germany, President [[Dilma Rousseff]] of Brazil, and President [[Isabel Martínez de Perón|Isabel Perón]] of Argentina. Even Pakistan and Turkey, countries often viewed as particularly male-dominated have had female prime ministers. Therefore, the United States, a country which promotes the rights of women and girls around the world, is conspicuous for having only male presidents.

In popular media in the United States, female politicians see some focus on their appearance; more so than their male counterparts. A 2011 feminist journal by Carlin and Winfrey focuses on the portrayal of female politicians in the media. According to the journal, the way media perceives women and men is very distinct in the language they chose to use. The language chosen to talk or describe other people can either hurt or help them in a political campaign. As a result of
women being talked about in sexist terms in can greatly affect her reputation and credibility.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Carlin | first1 = Diana B. | last2 = Winfrey | first2 = Kelly L. | title = Have you come a long way, baby?

The journal claims the media uses terms that indicative of women not being valued as individuals.  "This is especially true when women are described using metaphors that draw on animals, children, or food. Animal terms focus on the appearance and sexuality of young women (foxy), and as women grow older, or are seen as too aggressive, they may be called barracuda, old bat, shrew, or cow."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Females tend to have less issue coverage than males (due to fewer female politicians), but tend to have more coverage on things such as their appearance than male politicians.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Men candidates don't get coverage on what kind of suite they are wearing or who designed it. This is due to innate purpose of the media to appeal to demands of their audiences for sales – in this case the popular female focus on fashion that dominates the media. Studies done on women candidates have shown that women receive more attention in the media for factors such as appearance, clothes, size, and emotional state&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;".
In 2015 Rachel Silbermann conducted a study that time spent traveling to and from work is particularly burdensome for those who spend time caring for children, and as women do a majority of the child care and housework, commuting is particularly burdensome to them. Silbermann also found that female students weigh proximity to home twice as heavily as male students do in a hypothetical decision of whether to run for higher office. She suggests that to achieve equal representation of women in government men and women will need to share household responsibilities more equally.&lt;ref name="Silberman, R. 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Silbermann | first = Rachel | title = Gender roles, work-life balance, and running for office | journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Political Science]] | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–153 | publisher = Now Publishing Inc. | doi = 10.1561/100.00014087 | date = June 2015 | url = https://doi.org/10.1561/100.00014087 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study found no evidence that the low share of women in the  U.S. House of Representative was due to gender discrimination by voters.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Anastasopoulos |first=Lefteris | title = Estimating the gender penalty in House of Representative elections using a regression discontinuity design | journal = [[Electoral Studies]] | volume = 43 | issue =  | pages = 150–157 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.electstud.2016.04.008 | date = September 2016 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electstud.2016.04.008 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the author of the study, "these results suggest that the deficit of female representation in the House is more likely the result of barriers to entering politics as opposed to overt gender discrimination by voters and campaign donors."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 2017 study found that over the last decade, public opposition to &amp;nbsp;electing a woman as president was reduced from approximately 26% to 13%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burden|first=Barry C.|last2=Ono|first2=Yoshikuni|last3=Yamada|first3=Masahiro|date=2017-05-04|title=Reassessing Public Support for a Female President|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/691799|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=79|issue=3|pages=1073–1078|doi=10.1086/691799|issn=0022-3816}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

A 2018 study in the ''American Political Science Review'' did not find evidence that American voters were outright hostile to women in politics or that they held double standards. The study did however find that American voters preferred candidates who were married and had children. Since the burdens of child-rearing disproportionately fall on women in households, the bias in favor of married candidates with children may explain women's underrepresentation in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teele|first=Dawn Langan|last2=Kalla|first2=Joshua|last3=Rosenbluth|first3=Frances|date=2018|title=The Ties That Double Bind: Social Roles and Women's Underrepresentation in Politics|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/ties-that-double-bind-social-roles-and-womens-underrepresentation-in-politics/617A9986FF59B8934BC300DA21984121|journal=American Political Science Review|language=en|volume=|pages=1–17|doi=10.1017/S0003055418000217|issn=0003-0554|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Case Studies =====

====== Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton ======
In 2008, campaigns for both Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton were taken in great interest by fashion articles read mostly by women. The journal claims that Clinton was perceived as masculine and Palin was seen as feminine. "Palin's attractiveness resulted in frequent and varied references to her ''sexiness''; whereas, Clinton was viewed as not feminine enough in pantsuits that covered her ''cankles'' (thick ankles).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Various newspapers covered on how Palin was part of beauty pageants and this really affected the seriousness of her campaign. They took Palin as a joke and various individuals began to state that this was a political campaign and not
another beauty pageant. On the other hand Clinton was perceived as a "nut cracker" and "where boners go to die". Clinton's physical appearance and her choice of clothing, pantsuits over skirts and dresses, were the source of considerable ridicule.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Carlin and Winfrey believe that Clinton was not perceived as a sex symbol because she chose to wear pants over
skirts, and also because she was older than Palin. Due to the smaller proportion of women who pursue political careers, there is greater pressure on female politicians to succeed. The importance of criticisms about "cankles" and the like on public popularity in a presidential election is disputed. Many think these criticisms are neglegible, but Carlin and Winfrey believe this criticisms have a large effect. This analysis done on both Senator Clinton's and Governor Palin's campaign concluded that media coverage had a vast responsibility on how both women were viewed due to their gender
stereotypes and language used to "influence the public",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; though others argue that the style of media coverage is entirely the result of existing demand by the audience. There was national sample done that concluded that 51% of respondents ''believed'' that Americans were not ready for a women to be elected into high office.&lt;ref name="Lawless, J. 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lawless | first = Jennifer L. | author-link = Jennifer L.

====== Nikki Haley ======
The ''New York Journal'' explains how many in the general public of South Carolina were ignorant of the fact that Haley was Indian-American. According to one of her co-workers in the state legislator, voters saw Haley as a “nice conservative woman with a tan.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://echo.louisville.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1985149982?accountid=14665|title="For Nikki Haley, Dealing with Foreign Tyrants is the Easy Part of the Job."|last=Rice|first=Andrew|date=11 December 2017|website=New York Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While running the first time, for House of Representatives, in a semi-rural district, some of the voters pledged against Haley and said they would not vote for any candidate whose father was an immigrant. 

Throughout Haley’s 2010 campaign for Governor, opponents attacked her gender. These sexist comments did not sway Haley, who was self-confident in her own skin. She was called a “rag-head,” and “Mark Sandford in a skirt.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://echo.louisville.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1985149982?accountid=14665|title="For Nikki Haley, Dealing with Foreign Tyrants is the Easy Part of the Job."|last=Rice|first=Andrew|date=11 December 2017|website=New York Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haley responded in a positive way, she was not upset and seemed very level-headed. Then, one person who worked with Haley previously as a political consultant accused her of an affair. Haley rejected this very serious allegation and went forward to win the 2010 election for Governor of South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://echo.louisville.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1985149982?accountid=14665|title="For Nikki Haley, Dealing With Foreign Tyrants Is the Easy Part of the Job."|last=Rice|first=Andrew|date=11 December 2017|website=New York Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in government have historically been fewer in numbers in [[Western world|Western societies]] compared to men.  Some women, however, have served as heads of state and government. Although the number of women in government in the US has grown, they still hold less than 25% of government positions nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genderwatch2018.org/getting-to-congress-women/|title=The hardest part of being a woman in Congress?

The results show that 60% of respondents have a baseline gender preference for a male candidate, while 40% prefer a woman candidate. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dolan|first=Kathleen|date=2009-05-22|title=The Impact of Gender Stereotyped Evaluations on Support for Women Candidates|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11109-009-9090-4|journal=Political Behavior|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=69–88|doi=10.1007/s11109-009-9090-4|issn=0190-9320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparing women's integration into branches of government==

===Executive branch===
Women have been notably in fewer numbers in the executive branch of government.  The gender gap has been closing, however, albeit slowly&lt;ref name="Social Development 2005"/&gt; The first women other than monarchs to hold head of state positions were in socialist countries. The first was [[Khertek Anchimaa-Toka]] of the [[Tuvan People's Republic]] from 1940–1944, followed by [[Sükhbaataryn Yanjmaa]] of the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] 1953–1954 and [[Soong Ching-ling]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] from 1968–1972 and 1981.

Following the socialist countries, the Nordic countries have been forerunners in including women in the executive branch. The [[second cabinet Brundtland]] (1986–1989) was historical in that 8 out of 18 cabinet members were women, and in 2007 the [[second cabinet Stoltenberg]] (2005–2013) was more than 50% women.

In 2003, Finland had a historical moment when all top leaders of the country were women and also represented different political parties: [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social democrat]] [[Tarja Halonen]] was President, [[Riitta Uosukainen]] from [[National Coalition Party]] was [[Speaker of the Parliament of Finland|Speaker of the Parliament]] and after the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 2003|parliamentary elections of 2003]] [[Anneli Jäätteenmäki]] from [[Centre Party (Finland)|Center party]] was on her way to become the first female [[Prime Minister of Finland]]. By June 22, 2010 [[Mari Kiviniemi]] of the Centre Party was appointed the second female [[Prime Minister of Finland]].

Between 2007 and 2011 the Finnish cabinet was 60% female, with a female Prime Minister from 2010 to 2011. Between 2014 and 2015 the Finnish cabinet was 59% female.

The present Danish government is a coalition between the Social Democrats, the Social-Liberal Party and the Socialist People's Party. All three parties have female leaders. [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]] is Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Preisler | first = Marie | title = Denmark's gender equality policies: no quotas and a focus on men | journal = [[Nordic Labour Journal]] | publisher = [[Work Research Institute]] and [[Oslo and Akershus University College]] | date = March 8, 2013 | url = http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/i-fokus/in-focus-2013/equality-reaching-critical-mass/article.2013-03-08.2356410784 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's first elected [[List of elected or appointed female heads of state|female president]] was [[Vigdís Finnbogadóttir]] of [[Iceland]], whose term lasted from 1980 to 1996.

In 2005, [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] of [[Liberia]] became Africa's first elected female head of state.

===Legislative branch===
It was not until World War I and the first socialist revolutions that the first few women became members of governments. [[Alexandra Kollontai]] became the first female to hold a minister position, as the People's Commissar for Social Welfare in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = First female ministers | url = http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/First-female-ministers.htm | website = guide2womenleaders.com | publisher = Worldwide Guide to Women in Leadership }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nina Bang]], Danish Minister of Education from 1924–26, was the world's second full female cabinet minister.

The first female head of government was [[Evgenia Bosh]], the [[Bolshevik]] military leader who held the People's Secretary of Internal Affairs position in the Ukraine People's Republic of the Soviets of Workers and Peasants from 1917–1918, which was responsible for executive functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Woman Prime Ministers | url = http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/Premier_Ministers.htm | website = guide2womenleaders.com | publisher = Worldwide Guide to Women in Leadership }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ukraine | url = http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Ukraine.html | website = worldstatesmen.org | publisher = World Statesmen }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Yevgenia Bosch (1879–1925) | url = http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/uk/publish/article?art_id=1261011&amp;cat_id=661258 | website = kmu.gov.ua | publisher = Government of Ukraine | language = Ukrainian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, development was slow and it was not until the end of the 20th century that female ministers stopped being unusual.

The first government organization formed with the goal of women's equality was the [[Zhenotdel]], in Soviet Russia.

According to a 2006 report by the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]], 16% of all parliament members in the world are female. In 1995, the [[United Nations]] set a goal of 30% female representation.&lt;ref name="2006report"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Women politicians 'making gains' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4758036.stm |work=BBC News |date=28 February 2006 |accessdate=18 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current annual growth rate of women in national parliaments is about 0.5% worldwide. At this rate, gender parity in national legislatures will not be achieved until 2068.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

The top ten countries in terms of number of female parliamentary members are [[Rwanda]] with 56.3%, [[Sweden]] (47.0%), [[Cuba]] (43.2%), [[Finland]] (41.5%), the [[Netherlands]] (41.3%), [[Argentina]] (40.0%), [[Denmark]] (38.0%), [[Angola]] (37.3%), [[Costa Rica]] (36.8%), [[Spain]] (36.3%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Women in national parliaments | url = http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/arc/classif301108.htm | website = ipu.org | publisher = [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{As of|2008|08|30}} Cuba has the highest percentage for countries without a quota. In South Asia, Nepal is highest in the rank of women participation in politics with (33%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071209123905/http://sapint.org/ | archive-date = December 9, 2007 | url = http://www.sapint.org/ | website = sapint.or | publisher = South Asian Partnership }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among [[East Asian]] countries, [[Taiwan]] has the highest percentage of women in Parliament (38.0%). In the United States in 2008, the [[New Hampshire State Senate]] became the first state legislature upper house to possess an elected female majority.

The United Kingdom and United States are roughly in line with the world average. The [[House of Lords]] has 139 women (19.7%), while there are [[Women in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom|125 women]] (19.4%) in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]].

On November 6, 2012, New Hampshire made US History by having all-female congressional delegation to Congress with [[Annie Kuster]] being elected to [[New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district|represent New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district]] in the House of Representatives, [[Carol Shea-Porter]] regained her House seat to represent [[New Hampshire's 1st congressional district]] in the House of Representatives, and with [[Jeanne Shaheen]] and [[Kelly Ayotte]] both represented New Hampshire in the United States senate.&lt;ref&gt;New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 8, 2016, New Hampshire again made US History by having an all-female, all-[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] delegation to the US Congress. Incumbent Republican senator, Kelly Ayotte, was defeated by then-New Hampshire Governor, [[Maggie Hassan]], a Democrat, in the [[United States Senate election in New Hampshire, 2016|senate election]] to serve alongside Democratic senator, Jeanne Shaheen. Representative Carol Shea-Porter, a Democrat, defeated incumbent representative, [[Frank Guinta]], a Republican, again in New Hampshire's 1st congressional district to serve alongside Ann Kuster, who represents New Hampshire 2nd congressional district in the House of Representatives to achieve another historic "women's first".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmur.com/article/new-hampshire-sending-first-all-woman-all-democratic-delegation-to-dc/8369972|title=New Hampshire Sending First All-Woman, All-Democratic Delegation to DC|first=Cam|last=Tranchemontagne|date=27 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local representation===
There has been an increasing focus on women's representation at a local level.&lt;ref name="Basu, Amriyta 2003"/&gt;  Most of this research is focused on developing countries.  Governmental decentralization often results in local government structures that are more open to the participation of women, both as elected local councilors and as the clients of local government services.&lt;ref name="Social Development 2005"/&gt;
A 2003 survey conducted by United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), a global network supporting inclusive local governments, found that the average proportion of women in local council was 15%.  In leadership positions, the proportion of women was lower: for instance, 5% of mayors of Latin American municipalities are women.

According to a comparative study of women in local governments in East Asia and the Pacific, women have been more successful in reaching decision-making position in local governments than at the national level.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;  Local governments tend to be more accessible and have more available positions.  Also, women's role in local governments may be more accepted because they are seen as an extension of their involvement in the community.

====Indian panchayats====
The local panchayat system in India provides an example of women's representation at the local governmental level.&lt;ref name="Basu, Amriyta 2003"/&gt; The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments in 1992 mandated panchayat elections throughout the country.  The reforms reserved 33% of the seats for women and for castes and tribes proportional to their population.  Over 700,000 women were elected after the reforms were implemented in April 1993.

The '''Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies''' (F&amp;ES) is a [[professional school]] of [[Yale University]]. It was founded to train [[forester]]s, and now trains environmental leaders through four 2-year degree programs ([[Master of Environmental Management]], Master of [[Environmental Science]], Master of [[Forestry]], and Master of Forest Science) and two 10-month mid-career programs. Yale F&amp;ES strives to create new knowledge that will sustain and restore the health of the biosphere and emphasizes the possibility of creating a regenerative coexistence between humans and non-human life and the rest of the natural world. Still offering forestry instruction, the school has the oldest graduate forestry program in the United States.

==History==
[[File:Yale School of Forestry class of 1904.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Yale School of Forestry class of 1904]]
The school was founded in 1900 as the '''Yale Forest School''', to provide high-level forestry training suited to American conditions. At the urging of Yale alumnus [[Gifford Pinchot]], his parents endowed the two-year postgraduate program. At the time Pinchot was serving as [[Bernhard Fernow]]'s successor as Chief of the Division of Forestry (predecessor of the [[U.S. Forest Service]], USFS). Pinchot released two foresters from the division to start the school: fellow Yale graduate [[Henry Solon Graves]] and James Toumey.&lt;ref name=Sparhawk&gt;{{cite book |last=Sparhawk |first=W.N. |chapter=The History of Forestry in America |page=710 |title=Trees: Yearbook of Agriculture |year=1949 |location=Washington, D.C.  |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |url= https://archive.org/stream/treesyearbookofa00unitrich |accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graves became the School's first dean and Toumey its second.

When the school opened, other places in the United States offered forestry training, but none had a post-graduate program. (Both Pinchot and Graves had gone to Europe to study forestry after graduating from Yale.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pinchot |first=Gifford |title=Breaking New Ground |year=1998 |publisher=Island Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n64aE9kblKMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA152 |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 1900, the [[New York State College of Forestry at Cornell]] had 24 students, [[Biltmore Forest School]] 9, and Yale 7.&lt;ref name="Sparhawk" /&gt; Despite its small size, from its beginnings the school influenced American forestry. The first two chiefs of the USFS were Pinchot and Graves; the next three were graduates from the school's first decade. Wilderness and land conservation advocate [[Aldo Leopold]] graduated in the class of 1908.

In 1915, Yale School of Forestry's second dean, James Toumey, became one of the "charter members", along with [[William L. Bray]] of the [[History of the New York State College of Forestry|New York State College of Forestry]], by then reestablished at [[Syracuse University]], and [[Raphael Zon]], of the [[Ecological Society of America]].&lt;ref name="esa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.org/history/|title=You are being redirected...|author=|date=|website=esa.org|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the "activist wing" of that society formed [[The Nature Conservancy]].&lt;ref name="esa.org"/&gt;

Besides the school's own forests, Yale has used a number of other sites in the eastern United States for field education over the years. From 1904 to 1926, the summer session leading to a master's degree in forestry was held at [[Grey Towers National Historic Site|Grey Towers]] and [[Forester's Hall]] in [[Milford, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="arch"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce/SelectWelcome.asp |title=National Historic Landmarks &amp; National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania |publisher=CRGIS: Cultural Resources Geographic Information System |format=Searchable database}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web |url=https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce_imagery/phmc_scans/H050979_01H.pdf| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Forester's Hall |accessdate=2012-05-30 |last1=Steiner |first1=Ben |last2=Husson |first2=Leon |last3=Helfrich |first3=Carson O. |format = PDF |date= December 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1912, Yale classes took occasional field trips to the land of the Crossett Lumber Company in [[Arkansas]]. For two decades from 1946 until 1966, the company provided the school a "camp," including cabins and a mess hall, used during spring coursework on forest management and wood products production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author1-last=Darling, Jr. |author1-first=O.

Reflective of the expanding variety of environmental interests, the school changed its name to the '''Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies''' in 1972. Today, F&amp;ES is a leader in global sustainability, hosting the bi-annual [http://yess.yale.edu Yale Environmental Sustainability Summit] to assemble thought leaders from around the globe.

The [[Yale-Myers Forest]], in [[Union, Connecticut]], donated to Yale in 1930 by alumnus [[George Hewitt Myers]], is managed by the school as a multiple-use working forest. Yale-Toumey Forest, near [[Keene, New Hampshire]], was set up by James W. Toumey (a former dean of the school) in 1913. Other Yale forestlands include Goss Woods, Crowell Forest, Cross Woods, [[Bowen Forest]], and Crowell Ravine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://environment.yale.edu/forests/ |title=Yale School Forests |publisher=Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies |accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A three-alarm fire burned several buildings within the Yale Myers Forest Camp on May 28th, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2016/05/29/fire-claims-four-fes-buildings/|title=Fire claims four F&amp;ES buildings|author=|date=|website=yaledailynews.com|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rebuilding efforts are ongoing.

== Student life ==
The school has an active tradition of student involvement in academic and extracurricular life. Many students take part in student interest groups, which organize events around environmental issues of interest to them. These groups range in interest from Conservation Finance and International Development, to the Built Environment and "Fresh &amp; Salty: The Society for Marine and Coastal systems". There are also social and recreational groups, such as the Forestry Club, which every Friday organizes themed "TGIF" ("Thank-God-I'm-a-Forester") happy hours and school parties; the Polar Bear club, which swims monthly in Long Island Sound under the full moon (year-round); Veggie Dinner, which is a weekly vegetarian dinner club; the Loggerrhythms, an a cappella singing group; and the student-run BYO Café in Kroon Hall opened in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Henderson |first=Drew |title=Kroon opens student café |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=18 February 2010 |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2010/feb/18/kroon-opens-student-cafe/ |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A notable F&amp;ES tradition is the extravagant environmentally inspired decoration of graduation caps in preparation for commencement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://environment.yale.edu/blog/2012/05/graduation-snapshots/|title=Graduation snapshots|author=|date=|website=environment.yale.edu|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10390">'''Yannis Stavrakakis''' ({{lang-el|Γιάννης Σταυρακάκης}}; born 1970) is a Greek–British political theorist. A member of the [[Essex School of discourse analysis]], he is mainly known for his explorations of the importance of psychoanalytic theory ([[Freud]] and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]) for contemporary political and cultural analysis.

== Education and academic career ==

Stavrakakis was born in [[Sheffield]], UK. He studied political science at [[Panteion University]] (Athens) and discourse analysis at [[Essex University]]. He received his MA and PhD degrees from the ‘Ideology and Discourse Analysis’ programme at the University of Essex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ideology and Discourse Analysis Programme (IDA) | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090608231719/http://www.essex.ac.uk/ida/ | archive-date = 8 June 2009 | url = http://www.essex.ac.uk/ida/ | publisher = [[University of Essex]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; His doctoral thesis, completed under the supervision of [[Ernesto Laclau]], was entitled ‘New Directions in the Theory of Ideology and the Case of Green Ideology’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stavrakakis | first = Yannis | title = Lacan and the political | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780415171878 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1998 onwards he has worked at the Universities of Essex and Nottingham and at the Postgraduate Programme of the Department of Political Science and History of Panteion University. In 2006 he was appointed Associate Professor at the School of Political Sciences of the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]].&lt;ref name="Thessaloniki"&gt;{{cite web | title = Yannis Stavrakakis, Professor | url = http://www.polsci.auth.gr/index.php?lang=en&amp;rm=118&amp;mn=128&amp;stid=34 | website = polsci.auth.gr | publisher = [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since been promoted to Professor of Political Discourse Analysis and currently serves as deputy Head of School.&lt;ref name="Thessaloniki" /&gt;

Stavrakakis has also been recently elected (2012) in the executive board of the Hellenic Political Science Association, where he now serves as Vice-President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Board of Directors (2014-2016) | url = http://hpsa.gr/%CE%95%CE%95%CE%A0%CE%95/%CE%94%CE%B9%CE%BF%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%B7%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CE%A3%CF%85%CE%BC%CE%B2%CE%BF%CF%8D%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%BF/tabid/123/language/el-GR/Default.aspx | publisher = Hellenic Political Science Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the framework of the Association, he has co-founded a Research Network dedicated to the analysis of political discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url =http://www.discourse-analysis.gr | publisher = Discourse Analysis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

His research interests include contemporary political theory (with emphasis on psychoanalytic and post-structuralist approaches), the analysis of ideology and political discourse in societies of late modernity (with emphasis on the study of political ecology, [[populism]] and [[post-democracy]]) and the political dimensions of artistic practices and theater. His recent work has focused on the political and psychosocial implications of what he calls "debt societies" of Southern Europe (especially Greece) and on the emerging ideological cleavage between populist and anti-populist discourses within this context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Stavrakakis | first = Yannis | title = my country is the colony of a larger colony | url = http://www.chronosmag.eu/index.php/y-stavrakakis-my-country-is-the-colony-of-a-larger-colony.html | work = CHRONOS }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Stavrakakis | first1 = Yannis | last2 = Sevastakēs | first2 = Nikolas | title = Laïkismos, antilaïkismos kai krise | publisher = Ekdoseis Nephele | location = Athēna | year = 2012 | isbn = 9789605040468 }} [http://www.nnet.gr/downloads/dt-laikismos.pdf Details.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.anti-pop.gr/ | website = anti-pop.gr | publisher = The "Anti-Pop" Portal }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2014-5 period he has served as Principal Investigator of the POPULISMUS research project, co-funded by the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.populismus.gr/ | website = populismus.gr | publisher = POPULISMUS Research Project }}&lt;/ref&gt; The research focus of the project was on the relationship between populist discourse and democracy and it involved a variety of research and dissemination activities as well as the creation of an international Observatory of populist discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://observatory.populismus.gr/ | website = observatory.populismus.gr | publisher = International Observatory of Populist Discourse }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of his publications have been translated to a variety of other languages including Spanish, German, Japanese, Korean, Turkish, Russian, Bulgarian, etc.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, for his books in Spanish: via [http://www.fce.com.ar/ar/libros/detalles.aspx?IDL=6716 Fondo de Cultura Económica] and via [http://www.prometeoeditorial.com/catalogo/detalle.php?id_libro=276 Promoeteo Editorial].&lt;/ref&gt; He is contributing editor of the journal ''Psychoanalysis, Culture and Society'' (Palgrave) and member of the editorial boards of ''Subjectivity'' (Palgrave), ''Journal for Lacanian Studies'' and ''Synchrona Themata''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Publications in Greek | url = http://www.biblionet.gr/main.asp?page=showauthor&amp;personsid=6858 | website = biblionet.gr | publisher = Biblionet }}&lt;/ref&gt;
