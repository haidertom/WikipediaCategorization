      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9451">'''Agriculturalism''', also known as the '''School of Agrarianism''', the '''School of Agronomists''', the '''School of Tillers''', and in Chinese as the ''Nongjia'' (農家/农家), was an early [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] [[Chinese philosophy]] that advocated peasant [[utopian]] [[communalism]] and [[egalitarianism]], and was arguably the world's first [[Communist]] and [[Socialist]] movement that believed in a [[Classless society]].&lt;ref name="wp"&gt;{{cite book|last= Deutsch |first=Eliot |author2= Ronald Bontekoei|year=1999 | page= 183|title=A companion to world philosophies|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Agriculturalists believed that Chinese society should be modeled around that of the early sage king [[Shennong]], a folk hero who was portrayed in Chinese literature as "working in the fields, along with everyone else, and consulting with everyone else when any decision had to be reached."&lt;ref name="wp" /&gt; They encouraged farming and agriculture and taught farming and cultivation techniques, as they believed that agricultural development was the key to a stable and prosperous society.

Agriculturalism was suppressed during the [[Qin Dynasty]] and most original texts are now lost.
However, concepts originally associated with Agriculturalism have influenced [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[Chinese philosophy]] as a whole.&lt;ref name="js"/&gt; Agriculturalism has significantly influenced Chinese thought, and has been viewed as an essence of the Chinese identity.&lt;ref name="dg"&gt;{{cite book|last= Gladney |first=Dru|year=2004 | page= 300|title=Dislocating China|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Hundred Schools of Thought}}
[[Image:Shennong3.jpg|thumb|To the Agriculturalists, the governance and focus on agriculture by the legendary ruler [[Shennong]] served as a model of the ideal government.]]
Agriculturalism dates back to the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and [[Warring States period]], during a period known as the "[[Hundred Schools of Thought]]" which flourished from 770 to 221 BC. Throughout this period, competing states, seeking to war with one another and unite China as a single country, patronized philosophers, scholars, and teachers. The competition by scholars for the attention of rulers led to the development of different schools of thought, and the emphasis on recording teachings into books encouraged their spread.&lt;ref name="pe"&gt;{{cite book|last= Ebrey |first=Patricia|year=2010 | page= 42|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of China|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was an era characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments.&lt;ref name="pe"/&gt; The major philosophies of China, [[Confucianism]], [[Mohism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[Taoism]], all originated from this period.

Chinese tradition attributes the origin of Agriculturalism to the Chinese minister [[Hou Ji]], a figure known for his innovations in agriculture.&lt;ref name="js"&gt;{{cite book|last= Sellmann |first=James Daryl|year=2010 | page= 76|title=Timing and rulership in Master Lü's Spring and Autumn annals|publisher=SUNY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Agriculturalists also emphasized the role of [[Shennong]], the divine farmer, a semi-mythical ruler of early China credited by the Chinese as the inventor of agriculture. Shennong was seen as a proto-Agriculturalist, whose governance and focus on agriculture served as a model of the ideal Agriculturalist government.&lt;ref name="js"/&gt;

[[Xu Xing (philosopher)|Xu Xing]], a philosopher who defended Agriculturalism, settled with a group of followers in the state of [[Teng (state)|Teng]] in about 315 BC. A disciple of his visited the Confucian philosopher [[Mencius]], and a short report of their conversation discussing Xu Xing's philosophy survives.&lt;ref name=graham&gt;{{cite journal |title=The "Nung-chia" 農 家 'School of the Tillers' and the Origins of Peasant Utopianism in China|author=A. C. Graham|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|volume=42|number=1|year=1979|pages=66–100|jstor=614828|doi=10.1017/s0041977x00108468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of the [[Qin Dynasty]] in 221 BC saw the [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|purge of the Hundred Schools of Thought]], including Agriculturalism. The Legalist Qin dynasty was intolerant of other schools of thought, seeking to burn any text that did not adhere to the Legalist philosophy.&lt;ref name="sc"&gt;{{cite book|last= Ong |first= Siew Chey|year=2005 | page= 16|title=China condensed: 5000 years of history &amp; culture |publisher=Marshall Cavendish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, few Agriculturalist texts exist, and most of what is known of Agriculturalism comes from critical assessments by other philosophical schools.&lt;ref name="js"/&gt;

The bibliography of the [[Book of Han]] (2nd century AD) presents Agriculturalism as one of 10 philosophical schools and lists 9 books belonging to that school.&lt;ref name=graham/&gt;

==Philosophy==
Agriculturalism is primarily a social, economic, and political philosophy. The philosophy is founded on the notion that human society originates with the development of [[agriculture]], and societies are based upon "people's natural prospensity to farm."&lt;ref name="js"/&gt; The Agriculturalists described the ancient political system, seen as ideal, as one where "the means by which the early sage kings led their people was to put agriculture before all other affairs.. the reason why Hou Ji undertook agriculture was because he considered it to be the root of instructing the masses."&lt;ref name="js"/&gt;

===Political===
To the Agriculturalists, the ideal society, modeled after that of [[Shennong]]'s, is [[communalism|communal]], [[agrarianism|agrarian]], and [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]].&lt;ref name="wp"/&gt; The Agriculturalist believed that the ideal government is led by a benevolent king, one who works alongside the people in tilling the fields. The Agriculturalist king is not paid by the government through its treasuries; his livelihood is derived from the profits he earns working in the fields and cooking his own meals, not his leadership.&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt; Said [[Xu Xing (philosopher)|Xu Xing]], a prominent Agriculturalist:
{{quote|The ruler of Teng is an upright and worthy ruler. However, he has yet to hear the Way. A wise ruler tills the land together with his people to make his living. He governs while cooking his own meals. Now, that Teng has granaries and treasuries means that [the ruler] inflicts hardship on the people to fatten himself. How can he be a worthy ruler?|Xu Xing&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt;}}

===Economic===
Unlike the Confucians, the Agriculturalists did not believe in the [[division of labour]], arguing instead that the economic policies of a country need to be based upon an egalitarian [[self sufficiency]].&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt; The Agriculturalists supported the [[price fixing|fixing of prices]], in which all similar goods, regardless of differences in quality and demand, are set at exactly the same, unchanging price. They suggested that people should be paid the same amount for the same services, a policy criticized by the Confucians as encouraging products of low quality, which "destroys the earnest standards of craftmanship."&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt;

==Reception==
Agriculturalism was criticized extensively by rival philosophical schools, including the [[Mohist]] [[Mo Zi]], the Confucian [[Mencius]], and [[Yang Zhu]].&lt;ref name="js"/&gt; [[Mencius]] criticized its chief proponent [[Xu Xing (philosopher)|Xu Xing]] for advocating that rulers should work in the fields with their subjects, arguing that the Agriculturalist egalitarianism ignored the [[division of labour]] central to society. He points out that other early Chinese rulers did not work in fields, yet were equally as successful and revered as Shennong.&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt; Mencius dismisses Xu Xing as a "Southern barbarian with a twittering tongue."&lt;ref name="dw"&gt;{{cite book|last= Denecke|first=Wiebke|year=2011 | page= 38|title=The Dynamics of Masters Literature: Early Chinese Thought from Confucius to Han Feizi|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence===
{{see also|Agrarianism}}
The Legalist [[Qin Dynasty]] [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|purged rival philosophical schools]], including Agriculturalism, burning many Agriculturalist texts. However, Agriculturalism in its heyday heavily influenced the agrarian policies of [[Confucianism]], Legalism, and other philosophical schools,&lt;ref name="js"/&gt; so many concepts originally associated with the Agriculturalists continued to exist in Chinese philosophy. The transmission and translation of Chinese philosophical texts in Europe during the 18th century had a heavy influence on the development of [[Agrarianism]] in [[Europe]]. The French agrarianist philosophy, a predecessor to modern Agrarianism, of [[François Quesnay]] and the [[Physiocrats]], are said to have been modeled after the agrarian policies of Chinese philosophy.&lt;ref name="lam"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Maverick|first1= Lewis A.|year=1938|title= Chinese Influences Upon the Physiocrats|journal=Economic History|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index''''' ('''A&amp;HCI'''), also known as '''''Arts &amp; Humanities Search''''', is a [[citation index]], with abstracting and indexing for more than 1,700 arts and humanities journals, and coverage of disciplines that includes social and natural science journals. Part of this database is derived from [[Current Contents]] records. Furthermore, the print counterpart is Current Contents.

Subjects covered are the Arts, Humanities, Language (including Linguistics), Poetry, Music, Classical works, History, Oriental Studies, Philosophy, Archaeology, Architecture, Religion, Television, Theater, and Radio.

Available citation (source) coverage includes articles, letters, editorials, meeting abstracts, errata, poems, short stories, plays, music scores, excerpts from books, chronologies, bibliographies and filmographies, as well as citations to reviews of books, films, music, and theatrical performances.

This database can be accessed online through ''[[Web of Science]]''. It provides access to current and retrospective bibliographic information and cited references. It also covers individually selected, relevant items from approximately 1,200 titles, mostly arts and humanities journals but with an unspecified number of titles from other disciplines.

According to Thomson Reuters, the ''Arts &amp; Humanities Search'', can be accessed via Dialog, DataStar, and OCLC, with weekly updates and backfiles to 1980.&lt;ref name=dialog-blue&gt;

Static '''atmospheric models''' describe how the [[ideal gas]] properties (namely: pressure, temperature, density, and molecular weight) of an atmosphere change, primarily as a function of [[altitude]].  The [[World Meteorological Organization]] defines a standard atmosphere as "a hypothetical vertical distribution of atmospheric temperature, pressure and density which, by international agreement, is roughly representative of year-round, [[midlatitude]] conditions. Typical usages are as a basis for [[Altimeter#Pressure altimeter|pressure altimeter]] calibrations, aircraft performance calculations, aircraft and rocket design, [[External ballistics#Ambient air density|ballistic]] tables, and meteorological diagrams."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration| author-link = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration | author2 = National Aeronautics and Space Administration | author2-link = National Aeronautics and Space Administration | author3 = United States Air Force | author3-link = United States Air Force | date = October 1976 | title = U. S. Standard Atmosphere, 1976 | publisher = U. S. Government Printing Office | publication-place = Washington, D.C. | page = xiv | url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19770009539.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the [[U.S. Standard Atmosphere]] derives the values for air temperature, pressure, and mass density, as a function of altitude above sea level.

Other static atmospheric models may have other outputs, or depend on inputs besides altitude.

==Basic assumptions==
The gas which comprises an atmosphere is usually assumed to be an [[ideal gas]], which is to say:

&lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac{M P}{R T} &lt;/math&gt;

Where ''ρ'' is mass density, ''M'' is average molecular weight, ''P'' is pressure, ''T'' is temperature, and ''R'' is the ideal gas constant.

The gas is held in place by so-called "[[hydrostatic]]" forces.   That is to say, for a particular layer of gas at some altitude: the downward (towards the planet) force of its weight, the downward force exerted by pressure in the layer above it, and the upward force exerted by pressure in  the layer below, all sum to zero.  Mathematically this is:

:&lt;math&gt;P A - (P + \text{d}P) A - (\rho A \text{d}h) g_0 = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{d}P = - g_0 \rho \text{d}h \,&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, these variables describing the system do not change with time; i.e. it is a static system.

==Some examples==

Depending on the model, some gas properties may be treated as constant with respect to altitude.

===Ocean example===
If the density of a gas is persistent, then it isn't really behaving like a gas.  Instead it is behaving like an [[incompressible fluid]], or [[liquid]], and this situation looks more like an ocean.  Assuming density is constant, then a graph of pressure vs altitude will have a retained slope, since the weight of the ocean over head is directly proportional to its depth.

[[Image:Liquid ocean atmosphere model.png]]

===Isothermal-barotropic approximation and scale height===

This atmospheric model assumes both molecular weight and temperature are constant over a wide range of altitude. Such a model may be called [[isothermal]] (constant temperature). Inserting constant molecular weight and constant temperature into the equation for the [[ideal gas law]] produces the result that density and pressure, the two remaining variables, depend only on each other.  For this reason, this model may also be called [[barotropic]] (density depends only on pressure).

For the isothermal-barotropic model, density and pressure turn out to be exponential functions of altitude.  The increase in  altitude necessary for ''P'' or ''ρ'' to drop to 1/''e'' of its initial value is called the [[scale height]]:

:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{R T}{M g_0} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the ideal gas constant, ''T'' is temperature, ''M'' is average molecular weight, and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the gravitational acceleration at the planet's surface. Using the values ''T''=273 K and ''M''=29 g/mol as characteristic of the Earth's atmosphere, ''H'' = ''RT''/''Mg'' = (8.315*273)/(29*9.8) = 7.99, or about 8&amp;nbsp;km, which coincidentally is approximate height of [[Mount Everest|Mt. Everest]].

For an isothermal atmosphere,  &lt;math&gt;(1-\frac{1}{e})&lt;/math&gt; or about 63% of the total mass of the atmosphere exists between the planet's surface and one scale height.  (The total air mass below a certain altitude is calculated by integrating over the density function.)

For the ocean example there was a sharp transition in density at the top or "surface" of the ocean.  However, for atmospheres made of gas there is no equivalent sharp transition or edge.  Gas atmospheres simply get less and less dense until they're so thin that they're space.

[[Image:Isothermal-barotropic atmosphere model.png]]

===The U.S. Standard Atmosphere===
{{Main|U.S. Standard Atmosphere}}
The U.S. Standard Atmosphere model starts with many of the same assumptions as the isothermal-barotropic model, including ideal gas behavior, and constant molecular weight, but it differs by defining a more realistic temperature function, consisting of eight data points connected by straight lines; i.e. regions of constant temperature gradient. (See graph.)   Of course the real atmosphere does not have a temperature distribution with this exact shape.  The temperature function is an approximation.  Values for pressure and density are then calculated based on this temperature function, and the constant temperature gradients help to make some of the maths easier.

===NASA Global Reference Atmospheric Model===

The NASA Earth Global Reference Atmospheric Model (Earth-GRAM) was developed by the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] to provide a design reference atmosphere that, unlike the standard atmospheres, allows for geographical variability, a wide range of altitudes (surface to orbital altitudes), and different months and times of day.  It can also simulate spatial and temporal perturbations in atmospheric parameters due to turbulence and other atmospheric perturbation phenomena.  It is available&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Software Catalog 2015–2016 | chapter = Earth Global Reference Atmospheric Model (Earth-Gram) 2010 | publisher = NASA – Technology Transfer Program | place =  | url = https://software.nasa.gov/software/MFS-32780-1 | accessdate = 16 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in computer code written in [[Fortran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Leslie | first = F.W. | last2 = Justus | first2 = C.G. | date = June 2011 | title = The NASA Marshall Space Flight Center Earth Global Reference Atmospheric Model—2010 Version | series = NASA/TM—2011–216467 | publisher = National Aeronautics and Space Administration | place = Marshall Space Flight Center, Alabama | url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110012696.pdf | accessdate = 15 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The GRAM series also includes atmospheric models for the planets [[Venus]], [[Mars]] and [[Neptune]] and the [[Saturn]]ian moon, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Justh | first = Hilary L. | last2 = Justus | first2 = C.

==Geopotential altitude==

Gravitational acceleration, [[gravitational acceleration|''g''(z)]], decreases with altitude since moving up means moving away from the planet's center.

:&lt;math&gt;g(z) = \frac{G m_e}{(r_e + z)^2} &lt;/math&gt;

This problem of decreasing ''g'' can be dealt with by defining a transformation from real geometric altitude ''z'' to an abstraction called "geopotential altitude" ''h'', defined: 
:&lt;math&gt;h = \frac{r_e z}{r_e + z} &lt;/math&gt;

''h'' has the property 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{}{} g(z) dz = g_0 dh &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;g_0 = g(0) = \frac{G m_e}{{r_e}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Which basically says the amount of work done lifting a  test mass ''m'' to height ''z'' through an atmosphere where gravity decreases with altitude, is the same as the amount of work done lifting that same mass to a height ''h'' through an atmosphere where ''g'' magically remains equal to ''g0'', its value at sea level.

The '''Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics''' ('''BINP''') is one of the major centres of advanced study of [[nuclear physics]] in [[Russia]]. It is located in the [[Siberian]] town [[Akademgorodok]], on [[Academician Lavrentyev Avenue, Novosibirsk|Academician Lavrentiev Avenue]]. The institute was founded by [[Gersh Itskovich Budker]] in 1959. Following his death in 1977, the institute was renamed in honour of Academician Budker.

Despite its name, the centre was not involved either with military atomic science or nuclear reactors{{mdash}} instead, its concentration was on high-energy physics (particularly [[Plasma (physics)|plasma physics]]) and particle physics. In 1961 the institute began building [[:ru:ВЭП-1|VEP-1]],&lt;ref name="BINP-history"&gt;A. N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16170">'''Collocation''' is a procedure used in [[remote sensing]] 
to match measurements from two or more different instruments.
This is done for two main reasons: 
for validation purposes when comparing measurements of the same variable, 
and to relate measurements of two different variables 
either for performing retrievals or for prediction.
In the second case the data is later fed into some type of statistical 
[[inverse problem|inverse method]]
such as an [[artificial neural network]], [[statistical classification]] algorithm, 
[[kernel estimation|kernel estimator]] or a [[Linear least squares (mathematics)|linear least squares]]. 
In principle, most collocation problems can be solved by a [[nearest neighbor search]],
but in practice there are many other considerations involved and the best method is
highly specific to the particular matching of instruments.
Here we deal with some of the most important considerations along with specific examples.

There are at least two main considerations when performing collocations.
The first is the sampling pattern of the instrument.
Measurements may be dense and regular, such as those from a cross-track
scanning satellite instrument.  In this case, some form of [[interpolation]]
may be appropriate.  On the other hand, the measurements may be
sparse, such as a one-off field campaign designed for some
particular validation exercise.
The second consideration is the instrument footprint, which
can range from something approaching a point measurement
such as that of a [[radiosonde]], or it might be several
kilometers in diameter such as that of a satellite-mounted,
microwave radiometer.  In the latter case, it is appropriate
to take into account the instrument [[antenna pattern]] when
making comparisons with another instrument having both a smaller
footprint and a denser sampling, that is, several measurements
from the one instrument will fit into the footprint of the other.

Just as the instrument has a spatial footprint, it will also have
a temporal footprint, often called the integration time.
While the integration time is usually less than a second,
which for meteorological applications is essentially instantaneous,
there are many instances where some form of time averaging can considerably
ease the collocation process.

The collocations will need to be screened based on both the time
and length scales of the phenomenon of interest.
This will further facilitate the collocation process since 
remote sensing and other measurement data is almost always 
[[data binning|binned]] in some way.
Certain atmospheric phenomena such as clouds or convection are quite transient
so that we need not consider collocations with a time error of more than an hour or so.
Sea ice, on the other hand, moves and evolves quite slowly, so that
measurements separated by as much as a day or more might still be useful.

==Satellites==

[[Image:AMSUB scan tracks.png|thumb|center|upright=2.5|alt=AMSU-B flight tracks|Polar-stereographic projection showing 12 hours of measurements from three AMSU-B instruments]]

The [[satellite]]s that most concern us are those with a [[low Earth orbit|low-Earth]], [[polar orbit]] since [[geostationary]] satellites view the same point throughout their lifetime.
The diagram shows measurements from [[Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit|AMSU-B]]
instruments mounted on three satellites over a period of 12 hours.
This illustrates both the orbit path and the scan pattern which runs crosswise.
Since the [[orbit]] of a satellite is [[deterministic system|deterministic]], 
barring [[orbital maneuver|orbit maneuvers]], we can predict the location of the
satellite at a given time and, by extension, the location of
the measurement pixels.
In theory, collocations can be performed by inverting the
determining equations starting from the desired time period.
In practice, partially processed data (usually referred to as
level 1b, 1c or level 2) contain the coordinates of each of
the measurement pixels and  
it is common to simply feed these coordinates to a nearest neighbor search.
As mentioned previously, the satellite data is always [[Data binning|binned]]
in some manner.  
At minimum, the data will be arranged in 
swaths extending from pole to pole.
The swaths will be labelled by time period and the
approximate location known.

==Radiosondes==

[[Image:Rs ascent.gif|thumb|center|upright=2|alt=Ascent of a nominal weather balloon|Ascent of a weather balloon launched from the Polarstern research vessel]]

[[Radiosonde]]s are particularly important for collocation studies
because they measure atmospheric variables more accurately and more
directly than satellite or other remote-sensing instruments.
In addition, radiosonde samples are effectively instantaneous point measurements.
One issue with radiosondes carried aloft by [[weather balloon]]s is
balloon drift.  In,&lt;ref name="Buehler_etal2004"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
this is handled by averaging all the satellite pixels within a 50&amp;nbsp;km radius
of the balloon launch.

[[Image:Rs ascent hist.gif|thumb|right|upright=2|alt=Weather balloon ascent rate distribution|Histogram of ascent rates of weather balloons launch from the Polarstern research vessel]]

If high-resolution sonde data, which normally has a constant
sampling rate or includes the measurement time, is used,
then the lateral motion can be traced from the wind data.
Even with low-resolution data, the motion can still
be approximated by assuming a constant ascent rate.
Excepting a short bit towards the end, 
the linear ascent can be clearly seen in the figure above.
We can show that the ascent rate of a balloon is given
by the following equation
:&lt;ref name="Mills2004"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
v = \sqrt{\frac{g k h (1 - R_a/R_s)}{c_D}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g'' is gravitational acceleration,
''k'' relates the height, ''h'', and surface area, ''A'',
of the balloon to its volume: ''V''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''khA''; 
''R''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the equivalent "gas constant" of the balloon, 
''R''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is the gas constant of the air
and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; is the drag coefficient of the balloon.
Substituting some sensible values for each of the constants,
''k''=1. (the balloon is a perfect cylinder), ''h''=2. m, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.
and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is the gas constant of helium,
returns an ascent rate of 4.1&amp;nbsp;m/s.  Compare this with the
values shown in the histogram which compiles all of the
radiosonde launches from the [[Polarstern]] research vessel
over a period of eleven years between 1992 and 2003.

==Interpolation==

For gridded data such as [[data assimilation|assimilation]] or [[meteorological reanalysis|reanalysis]] data,
[[interpolation]] is likely the most appropriate method for performing any type of comparison.
A specific point in both physical position and time is easy to locate
within the grid and interpolation performed between the nearest neighbors.
[[Linear interpolation]] ([[bilinear interpolation|bilinear]], [[trilinear interpolation|trilinear]] etc.) is the most common, 
though cubic is used as well but is probably not worth the extra computational overhead.
If the variable of interest has a relatively smooth rate of change (temperature is a good example of this because it
has a diffusion mechanism, [[radiative transfer]], not available to other atmospheric variables), 
then interpolation can eliminate much of the error associated with collocation.

Interpolation may also be appropriate for many types of satellite instruments,
for instance a cross-track scanning instrument like [[Landsat]].

interpolated (although not for the purposes of collocation) using a slight variation
of trilinear interpolation.
Since measurements within a single scan track are laid out in an approximately rectangular
grid, bilinear interpolation can be performed.
By searching for the nearest overlapping scan track both forwards and backwards in time,
the spatial interpolates can then be interpolated in time. 
This technique works better with derived quantities rather than raw brightness temperatures since
the scan angle will already have been accounted for.

For instruments with a more irregular sampling pattern, such as the [[Aqua (satellite)|Advanced Microwave
Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E)]] instrument which has a circular scanning pattern,
we need a more general form of interpolation such as [[kernel estimation]].
A method commonly used for this particular instrument, as well as [[SSM/I]],
is a simple daily average within regularly gridded, spatial bins

==Trajectories==

To collocate measurements of a medium- to long-lived [[flow tracer|atmospheric tracer]] with a second instrument, running [[trajectory (meteorology)|trajectories]] can considerably improve the accuracy.  It also simplifies the analysis somewhat: a trajectory is run both forwards and backwards from the measurement location and between the desired time window.  Note that the acceptable time window has now become longer because the error from transport induced changes in the tracer is removed: the tracer lifetime would be a good window to use.  Since the trajectories provide a location for every point in time within the time window, there is no need to check multiple measurements from the second instrument.  Every time within the trajectory is checked for the distance criterion but within a very narrow window.  Alternatively, the exact times of the measurements for the second instrument are interpolated within the trajectory.  Only the smallest distance error below the threshold is used and the distance criterion can be made smaller as a consequence.

==Example: Pol-Ice Campaign==

[[Image:EM-bird flights.png|thumb|center|upright=2|alt=Pol-Ice E-M bird flights|Map of E-M Bird flights from Pol-Ice campaign along with coincident EMIRAD flights]]

Collocations of sea ice thickness and [[brightness temperature]]s taken during the
[[Pol-Ice Campaign]] are an excellent example since they illustrate many of the most important principles as well as demonstrating the necessity of taking into account the individual case.  The Pol-Ice campaign was conducted in the N. Baltic in March 2007 as part of the SMOS-Ice project in preparation for the launch of the [[Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite]].  
Because of the low frequency of the SMOS instrument, it is hoped that it will render
information on sea ice thickness, therefore the campaign comprised measurements
of both sea ice thickness and emitted brightness temperature.
Brightness temperatures were measured with the EMIRAD L-band microwave radiometer
&lt;ref name="Skou_etal2007"&gt;

carried on board an airplane. Ice thickness was measured with the E-M Bird ice thickness meter which was carried by a helicopter.  The E-M Bird measures ice thickness with a combination of inductance measurements to determine the location of the ice-water interface and a [[LIDAR|laser altimeter]] to measure the height of the ice surface.&lt;ref name="Heygster_etal2009"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The map above shows the flight tracks of both instruments which were approximately coincident but obviously subject to pilot error.

[[Image:EMIRAD pattern.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.5|alt=EMIRAD antenna response pattern|EMIRAD antenna response pattern]]

Since the flight paths of both aircraft were approximately linear, the first step in the collocation process was to convert all the coincident flights to Cartesian coordinates with the ''x''-axis being lateral distance and the ''y''-axis transverse distance.  In this way, collocations can be performed in two ways: crudely, by matching only the ''x'' distances, and more precisely by matching both coordinates.

More importantly, the footprint size of the radiometer is many times larger
than that of the E-M Bird meter.  The figure to the left shows
the [[radiation pattern|antenna response function]] for the radiometer.
The [[full width at half maximum]] is 31 degrees.&lt;ref name="Skou_etal2007"/&gt;
Since the aircraft was flying at approximately 500 m, this translates
to a footprint size of 200 m or more.
Meanwhile, the footprint size of the E-M Bird was roughly 40 m
with a sample spacing of only 2 to 4 m.&lt;ref name="Heygster_etal2009"/&gt;
Rather than looking to nearest neighbors, which would have produced
poor results, a weighted average of the thickness measurements was
performed for each radiometer measurement.
Weights were calculated based on the radiometer response function which is almost
a perfect Gaussian up to about 45 degrees.
Points could be excluded based on distance along the flight
path.
For validation of sea ice emissivity forward model calculations, 
this was further refined by performing an emissivity calculation
for each thickness measurement and averaging over the radiometer
footprint.

'''Contamination''' is the presence of an unwanted constituent, contaminant or [[impurity]] in a material, [[physical body]], [[natural environment]], [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]], etc.
Contaminants are biological, chemical, physical or radiological substance.

==Sciences==
"Contamination" has also more specific meanings in science:
*In [[chemistry]], the term usually describes a single constituent, but in specialized fields the term can also mean chemical mixtures, even up to the level of cellular materials. All chemicals contain some level of [[impurity]]. Contamination may be recognized or not and may become an issue if the impure chemical is mixed with other chemicals or mixtures and causes additional [[chemical reaction]]s. The additional chemical reactions can sometimes be beneficial, in which case the label ‘contaminant’ is replaced with [[reactant]] or [[catalyst]]. If the additional reactions are detrimental, other terms are often applied such as [[toxin]], [[poison]] or [[pollutant]], depending on the type of [[molecule]] involved. A major fraction of chemistry is involved with identifying, isolating, and studying contaminants.
*In [[environmental chemistry]] the term is in some cases virtually equivalent to [[pollution]], where the main interest is the harm done on a large scale to humans or to organisms or environments that are important to humans.
*In [[radiation protection]] the [[radioactive contamination]] is radioactive substances on surfaces, or within solids, liquids or gases (including the human body), where their presence is unintended or undesirable, or the process giving rise to their presence in such places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=IAEA Safety Glossary: Terminology Used in Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection |last1=International Atomic Energy Agency |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=IAEA |location=Vienna |isbn=92-0-100707-8 |pages= |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1290_web.pdf |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Programmes and Systems for Source and Environmental Radiation Monitoring.

: Also used less formally to refer to a quantity, namely the amount of [[radioactive decay#Radioactive decay rates|radioactivity]] in a location or on a surface, or on a unit area of a surface, such as a square meter or centimeter. 
:Contamination may include residual [[radioactive material]] remaining at a site after the completion of [[nuclear decommissioning|decommissioning]] of a site where there was a [[nuclear reactor]], such as a [[power plant]], [[experimental reactor]], [[isotope reactor]] or a [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear powered ship]] or [[nuclear submarine|submarine]].
:The term [[radioactive contamination]] may have a connotation that is not intended. The term refers only to the presence of [[radioactivity]], and gives no indication of the magnitude of the hazard involved.
*In [[organic agriculture]] contamination with [[genetically modified organisms]] (GMOs) has been a cause for decertification of a farm.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2014) [http://orgprints.org/26549/7/26549.pdf  Organic versus GMO farming: Contamination, what contamination?].

International Sustainable Development Research Society (ISDRS) Newsletter, Issue 3: 8&lt;/ref&gt;

*In [[food chemistry]] and [[medicinal chemistry]], the term "contamination" is used to describe harmful intrusions, such as the presence of [[toxin]]s or [[pathogen]]s in [[food]] or [[pharmaceutical drug]]s, see [[food contaminant]].
*In [[forensic science]], a contaminant can be [[fingerprint]]s, [[hair]], [[human skin|skin]] or [[DNA]] from [[first responder]]s or from sources not related to the ongoing investigation, such as family members or friends of the victim who are not suspects. 
*In the [[biology|biological sciences]], accidental introduction of "foreign" material ('contamination') can seriously distort the results of experiments where small samples are used. In cases where the contaminant is a living [[microorganism]], it can often multiply and take over the experiment, especially cultures, and render them useless.
*In [[geology]] and especially [[geochemistry]], it can have similar effects where even a few grains of "modern" dust can distort results of sophisticated experiments.
*the term "contamination" is sometimes used to describe accidental transfers of organisms from one natural environment to another.
*it has even been used in the "directed [[panspermia]]" hypothesis about the origin of life on Earth, which suggests that visiting aliens accidentally infected the planet with [[microbe]]s from their own world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''cosmos''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|k|ɒ|z|m|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|-|m|oʊ|s}}) is the [[universe]]. Using the word ''cosmos'' rather than the word ''universe'' implies viewing the universe as a complex and orderly [[system]] or entity; the opposite of [[Chaos (cosmogony)| chaos]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The cosmos, and our understanding of the reasons for its existence and significance, are studied in [[cosmology]] - a very broad discipline covering any scientific, religious, or philosophical contemplation of the cosmos and its nature, or reasons for existing. Religious and philosophical approaches may include in their concepts of the cosmos various spiritual entities or other matters deemed to exist outside our physical universe.

== Etymology ==
The [[philosopher]] [[Pythagoras]] first used the term ''cosmos'' ({{lang-grc|κόσμος}}) for the order of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iamblichus]], ''Pyth.'', β 59; [[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] ΙΙ 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anaxagoras]] further introduced the concept of a Cosmic Mind (''[[Nous]]'') ordering all things (Aetius Ι 3.5).&lt;/ref&gt; The term became part of modern language in the 19th century when geographer–polymath [[Alexander von Humboldt]] resurrected the use of the word from the ancient Greek, assigned it to his five-volume treatise, ''[[Kosmos (Humboldt)|Kosmos]]'', which influenced modern and somewhat [[holism|holistic]] perception of the universe as one interacting [[entity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MfgpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe|last=Humboldt|first=Alexander von|last2=Paul|first2=Benjamin Horatio|last3=von)|first3=Wilhelm Humboldt (Freiherr|last4=Dallas|first4=William Sweetland|date=1860|publisher=Harper &amp; brothers|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humansandnature.org/introducing-humboldt-s-cosmos-article-26.php|title=Introducing Humboldt's Cosmos {{!}} Center for Humans &amp; Nature|website=Center for Humans &amp; Nature|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cosmology ==
[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|right|The Ancient and [[Medieval]] cosmos as depicted in [[Peter Apian]]'s ''Cosmographia'' (Antwerp, 1539).]]
[[Cosmology]] is the study of the cosmos, and in its broadest sense covers a variety of very different approaches: scientific, religious and philosophical. All cosmologies have in common an attempt to understand the implicit order within the whole of being. In this way, most religions and [[philosophy|philosophical]] systems have a cosmology.

When ''cosmology'' is used without a qualifier, it often signifies physical cosmology, unless the context makes clear that a different meaning is intended.

=== Physical cosmology ===
{{main|Cosmology}}
Physical cosmology (often simply described as 'cosmology') is the scientific study of the universe, from the beginning of its physical existence. It includes speculative concepts such as a multiverse, when these are being discussed. In [[physical cosmology]], the term ''cosmos'' is often used in a technical way, referring to a particular [[spacetime]] continuum within a (postulated) [[multiverse]]. Our particular cosmos, the [[observable universe]], is generally capitalized as ''the Cosmos''. 

In physical cosmology, the uncapitalized term '''cosmic''' signifies a subject with a relationship to the universe, such as 'cosmic time' (time since the [[Big Bang]]), '[[cosmic rays]]' (high energy particles or radiation detected from [[outer space|space]]), and '[[cosmic microwave background]]' (microwave radiation detectable from all directions in space).

According to [[wikisource:Author:Charles Peter Mason|Charles Peter Mason]] in [[William Smith (lexicographer)|Sir William Smith]] ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'' (1870, see book screenshot for full quote), [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] described the universe.&lt;ref name=CPM&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir William Smith|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology|year=1870|url=https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofgree03smituoft#page/304/|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Philolaus-and-Philomelus-Pythagorean-Book.jpg|thumb|upright|Excerpt from [[Philolaus]] Pythagoras book, (Charles Peter Mason, 1870)]]
{{quote|
It appears, in fact, from this, as well as from the extant fragments, that the first book (from [[Philolaus]]) of the work contained a general account of the origin and arrangement of the universe. The second book appears to have been an exposition of the nature of numbers, which in the Pythagorean theory are the essence and source of all things. (p. 305)}}

=== Philosophical cosmology ===
{{main|Philosophical cosmology}}
Cosmology is a branch of [[metaphysics]] that deals with the nature of the universe, a theory or doctrine describing the natural order of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cosmology|title=Definition of "Cosmology"|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic definition of Cosmology is the science of the origin and development of the universe. In modern astronomy the [[Big Bang|Big Bang theory]] is the dominant postulation.

=== Religious cosmology ===
{{see also|Religious cosmology|Hellenistic philosophy and Christianity|Orphism (religion)}}

In [[theology]], the cosmos is the [[Creation myth|created]] heavenly bodies (sun, moon, planets, and [[fixed stars]]). In [[Christian theology]], the word is also used synonymously with ''[[aeon|aion]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concerning Aion and Aionios|url=http://www.saviourofall.org/Writings/aion.html|publisher=Saviour of All Fellowship|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to "worldly life" or "this world" or "this age" as opposed to the [[afterlife]] or [[world to come]].

The 1870 book ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' noted&lt;ref name=CPM /&gt;
:[[Thales]] dogma that water is the origin of things, that is, that it is that out of which every thing arises, and into which every thing resolves itself, Thales may have followed Orphic cosmogonies, while, unlike them, he sought to establish the truth of the assertion. Hence, Aristotle, immediately after he has called him the originator of philosophy brings forward the reasons which Thales was believed to have adduced in confirmation of that assertion; for that no written development of it, or indeed any book by ''Thales'', was extant, is proved by the expressions which Aristotle uses when he brings forward the doctrines and proofs of the [[Miletus|Milesian]]. (p. 1016)

:[[Plato]], describes the idea of the good, or the Godhead, sometimes ''teleologically'', as the ultimate purpose of all conditioned existence; sometimes ''cosmologically'', as the ultimate operative cause; and has begun to develop the ''cosmological'', as also the physico-theological proof for the being of God; but has referred both back to the idea of the Good, as the necessary presupposition to all other ideas, and our cognition of them. (p. 402)

The book ''The Works of Aristotle'' (1908, p.&amp;nbsp;80 ''Fragments'') mentioned&lt;ref name=Aristotle1908&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/worksofaristotle12arisuoft|title=The Works of Aristotle|year=1908|author=Aristotle|author2=Ross, W. D. (William David), 1877|author3=Smith, J. A. (John Alexander), 1863-1939|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Aristotle says the poet ''Orpheus'' never existed; the Pythagoreans ascribe this Orphic poem to a certain ''Cercon'' (see [[Cercops]]).

[[Bertrand Russell]] (1947) noted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp|title=History of Western Philosophy|year=1947|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The Orphics were an ascetic sect; wine, to them, was only a symbol, as, later, in the Christian sacrament. The intoxication that they sought was that of "enthusiasm," of union with the god. They believed themselves, in this way, to acquire mystic knowledge not obtainable by ordinary means. This mystical element entered into Greek philosophy with Pythagoras, who was a reformer of Orphism as Orpheus was a reformer of the religion of Dionysus. From Pythagoras Orphic elements entered into the philosophy of Plato, and from Plato into most later philosophy that was in any degree religious.

'''Data mining'''  is the process of discovering patterns in large [[data set]]s involving methods at the intersection of [[machine learning]], [[statistics]], and [[database system]]s.&lt;ref name="acm" /&gt; Data mining is an [[interdisciplinary]] subfield of [[computer science]] with an overall goal to extract information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transform the information into a comprehensible structure for further use.&lt;ref name="acm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kdd.org/curriculum/index.html |title=Data Mining Curriculum |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[SIGKDD]] |date=2006-04-30 |accessdate=2014-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brittanica"&gt;{{cite web |last=Clifton |first=Christopher |title=Encyclopædia Britannica: Definition of Data Mining |year=2010 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1056150/data-mining |accessdate=2010-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elements"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hastie|first1=Trevor|authorlink1=Trevor Hastie|last2=Tibshirani|first2=Robert|authorlink2=Robert Tibshirani|last3=Friedman|first3=Jerome|authorlink3=Jerome H.

The term "data mining" is in fact a [[misnomer]], because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (''mining'') of data itself.&lt;ref name="han-kamber"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jiawei |last1=Han |authorlink1=Jiawei Han |first2=Micheline |last2=Kamber |date=2001 |title=Data mining: concepts and techniques |publisher=[[Morgan Kaufmann]] |page=5 |isbn=978-1-55860-489-6 |quote=Thus, data mining should have been more appropriately named "knowledge mining from data," which is unfortunately somewhat long}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also is a [[buzzword]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.okairp.org/documents/2005%20Fall/F05_ROMEDataQualityETC.pdf OKAIRP 2005 Fall Conference, Arizona State University] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201170452/http://www.okairp.org/documents/2005%20Fall/F05_ROMEDataQualityETC.pdf |date=2014-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is frequently applied to any form of large-scale data or [[information processing]] ([[Data collection|collection]], [[information extraction|extraction]], [[Data warehouse|warehousing]], [[data analysis|analysis]], and statistics) as well as any application of [[Decision support system|computer decision support system]], including [[artificial intelligence]] (e.g., machine learning) and [[business intelligence]].

The actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records ([[cluster analysis]]), unusual records ([[anomaly detection]]), and dependencies ([[association rule mining]], [[sequential pattern mining]]). This usually involves using database techniques such as [[spatial index|spatial indices]]. These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and [[predictive analytics]]. For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a [[decision support system]]. Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, but do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps.

The related terms ''[[data dredging]]'', ''data fishing'', and ''data snooping'' refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered. These methods can, however, be used in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations.

==Etymology==
In the 1960s, statisticians and economists used terms like ''data fishing'' or ''data dredging'' to refer to what they considered the bad practice of analyzing data without an a-priori hypothesis. The term "data mining" was used in a similarly critical way by economist [[Michael Lovell]] in an article published in the [[Review of Economic Studies]] 1983. Lovell indicates that the practice "masquerades under a variety of aliases, ranging from "experimentation" (positive) to "fishing" or "snooping" (negative).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lovell|first=Michael C.|date=1983|title=Data Mining|journal=The Review of Economics and Statistics|volume=65|issue=1|pages=1–12|doi=10.2307/1924403|jstor=1924403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''data mining'' appeared around 1990 in the database community, generally with positive connotations. For a short time in 1980s, a phrase "database mining"™, was used, but since it was trademarked by HNC, a San Diego-based company, to pitch their Database Mining Workstation;&lt;ref name="Mena"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mena |first=Jesús |year=2011 |title=Machine Learning Forensics for Law Enforcement, Security, and Intelligence |location=Boca Raton, FL |publisher=CRC Press (Taylor &amp; Francis Group) |isbn=978-1-4398-6069-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers consequently turned to ''data mining''. Other terms used include ''data archaeology'', ''information harvesting'', ''information discovery'', ''knowledge extraction'', etc. [[Gregory I. Piatetsky-Shapiro|Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro]] coined the term "knowledge discovery in databases" for the first workshop on the same topic [http://www.kdnuggets.com/meetings/kdd89/ (KDD-1989)] and this term became more popular in [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] and [[machine learning]] community. However, the term data mining became more popular in the business and press communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Piatetsky-Shapiro |first1=Gregory |authorlink1=Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro |last2=Parker |first2=Gary |url=http://www.kdnuggets.com/data_mining_course/x1-intro-to-data-mining-notes.html |title=Lesson: Data Mining, and Knowledge Discovery: An Introduction |publisher=KD Nuggets |year=2011 |work=Introduction to Data Mining |accessdate=30 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the terms ''data mining'' and ''knowledge discovery'' are used interchangeably.

In the academic community, the major forums for research started in 1995 when the First International Conference on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery ([[KDD-95]]) was started in Montreal under [[AAAI]] sponsorship. It was co-chaired by [[Usama Fayyad]] and Ramasamy Uthurusamy. A year later, in 1996, Usama Fayyad launched the journal by Kluwer called [[Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery]] as its founding editor-in-chief. Later he started the [[SIGKDD]] Newsletter SIGKDD Explorations.&lt;ref name=SIGKDD-explorations&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fayyad|first1=Usama|title=First Editorial by Editor-in-Chief|journal=SIGKDD Explorations|date=15 June 1999|volume=13|issue=1|pages=102|doi=10.1145/2207243.2207269|url=http://www.kdd.org/explorations/view/june-1999-volume-1-issue-1|accessdate=27 December 2010|ref=SIGKDD-explorations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KDD International conference became the primary highest quality conference in data mining with an acceptance rate of research paper submissions below 18%. The journal ''Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery'' is the primary research journal of the field.

==Background==
The manual extraction of patterns from [[data]] has occurred for centuries. Early methods of identifying patterns in data include [[Bayes' theorem]] (1700s) and [[regression analysis]] (1800s). The proliferation, ubiquity and increasing power of computer technology has dramatically increased data collection, storage, and manipulation ability. As [[data set]]s have grown in size and complexity, direct "hands-on" data analysis has increasingly been augmented with indirect, automated data processing, aided by other discoveries in computer science, such as [[neural networks]], [[cluster analysis]], [[genetic algorithms]] (1950s), [[decision tree learning|decision trees]] and [[decision rules]] (1960s), and [[support vector machines]] (1990s). Data mining is the process of applying these methods with the intention of uncovering hidden patterns&lt;ref name="Kantardzic"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kantardzic |first=Mehmed |title=Data Mining: Concepts, Models, Methods, and Algorithms |year=2003 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-22852-3 |oclc=50055336 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in large data sets. It bridges the gap from [[applied statistics]] and artificial intelligence (which usually provide the mathematical background) to [[database management]] by exploiting the way data is stored and indexed in databases to execute the actual learning and discovery algorithms more efficiently, allowing such methods to be applied to ever larger data sets.

==Process==
The ''knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) process'' is commonly defined with the stages:

# Selection
# Pre-processing
# Transformation
# ''Data mining''
# Interpretation/evaluation.&lt;ref name="Fayyad" /&gt;

It exists, however, in many variations on this theme, such as the [[Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining]] (CRISP-DM) which defines six phases:

# Business understanding
# Data understanding
# Data preparation
# Modeling
# Evaluation
# Deployment

or a simplified process such as (1) Pre-processing, (2) Data Mining, and (3) Results Validation.

Polls conducted in 2002, 2004, 2007 and 2014 show that the CRISP-DM methodology is the leading methodology used by data miners.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro]] (2002) [http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/2002/methodology.htm ''KDnuggets Methodology Poll''], [[Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro]] (2004) [http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/2004/data_mining_methodology.htm ''KDnuggets Methodology Poll''], [[Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro]] (2007) [http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/2007/data_mining_methodology.htm ''KDnuggets Methodology Poll''], [[Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro]] (2014) [http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/2014/analytics-data-mining-data-science-methodology.html ''KDnuggets Methodology Poll'']&lt;/ref&gt; The only other data mining standard named in these polls was [[SEMMA]]. However, 3–4 times as many people reported using CRISP-DM. Several teams of researchers have published reviews of data mining process models,&lt;ref name="Marban"&gt;Óscar Marbán, Gonzalo Mariscal and Javier Segovia (2009); [http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/5937/InTech-A_data_mining_amp_knowledge_discovery_process_model.pdf ''A Data Mining &amp; Knowledge Discovery Process Model''].

In Proceedings of the IADIS European Conference on Data Mining 2008, pp&amp;nbsp;182–185.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-processing===
Before data mining algorithms can be used, a target data set must be assembled. As data mining can only uncover patterns actually present in the data, the target data set must be large enough to contain these patterns while remaining concise enough to be mined within an acceptable time limit. A common source for data is a [[data mart]] or [[data warehouse]]. Pre-processing is essential to analyze the [[Multivariate statistics|multivariate]] data sets before data mining. The target set is then cleaned. Data cleaning removes the observations containing [[statistical noise|noise]] and those with [[missing data]].

===Data mining===
Data mining involves six common classes of tasks:&lt;ref name="Fayyad"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fayyad |first1=Usama |authorlink1=Usama Fayyad |last2=Piatetsky-Shapiro |first2=Gregory|authorlink2=Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro |last3=Smyth |first3=Padhraic |title=From Data Mining to Knowledge Discovery in Databases |year=1996 |url=http://www.kdnuggets.com/gpspubs/aimag-kdd-overview-1996-Fayyad.pdf |accessdate = 17 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Anomaly detection]] (outlier/change/deviation detection) – The identification of unusual data records, that might be interesting or data errors that require further investigation.
* [[Association rule learning]] (dependency modelling) – Searches for relationships between variables. For example, a supermarket might gather data on customer purchasing habits. Using association rule learning, the supermarket can determine which products are frequently bought together and use this information for marketing purposes. This is sometimes referred to as market basket analysis.
* [[Cluster analysis|Clustering]] – is the task of discovering groups and structures in the data that are in some way or another "similar", without using known structures in the data.
* [[Statistical classification|Classification]] – is the task of generalizing known structure to apply to new data. For example, an e-mail program might attempt to classify an e-mail as "legitimate" or as "spam".
* [[Regression analysis|Regression]] – attempts to find a function which models the data with the least error that is, for estimating the relationships among data or datasets.
* [[Automatic summarization|Summarization]] – providing a more compact representation of the data set, including visualization and report generation.

===Results validation===
[[File:Spurious correlations - spelling bee spiders.svg|thumb|An example of data produced by [[data dredging]] through a bot operated by statistician Tyler Vigen, apparently showing a close link between the best word winning a spelling bee competition and the number of people in the United States killed by venomous spiders. The similarity in trends is obviously a coincidence.]]
Data mining can unintentionally be misused, and can then produce results which appear to be significant; but which do not actually predict future behaviour and cannot be [[Reproducibility|reproduced]] on a new sample of data and bear little use. Often this results from investigating too many hypotheses and not performing proper [[statistical hypothesis testing]]. A simple version of this problem in [[machine learning]] is known as [[overfitting]], but the same problem can arise at different phases of the process and thus a train/test split - when applicable at all - may not be sufficient to prevent this from happening.&lt;ref name=hawkins&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawkins | first1 = Douglas M | year = 2004 | title = The problem of overfitting | url = | journal = Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 1–12 | doi=10.1021/ci0342472| pmid = 14741005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Missing information|section|non-classification tasks in data mining. It only covers [[machine learning]]|date=September 2011}}
The final step of knowledge discovery from data is to verify that the patterns produced by the data mining algorithms occur in the wider data set. Not all patterns found by the data mining algorithms are necessarily valid. It is common for the data mining algorithms to find patterns in the training set which are not present in the general data set. This is called [[overfitting]]. To overcome this, the evaluation uses a [[test set]] of data on which the data mining algorithm was not trained. The learned patterns are applied to this test set, and the resulting output is compared to the desired output. For example, a data mining algorithm trying to distinguish "spam" from "legitimate" emails would be trained on a [[training set]] of sample e-mails. Once trained, the learned patterns would be applied to the test set of e-mails on which it had ''not'' been trained. The accuracy of the patterns can then be measured from how many e-mails they correctly classify. A number of statistical methods may be used to evaluate the algorithm, such as [[Receiver operating characteristic|ROC curves]].

If the learned patterns do not meet the desired standards, subsequently it is necessary to re-evaluate and change the pre-processing and data mining steps. If the learned patterns do meet the desired standards, then the final step is to interpret the learned patterns and turn them into knowledge.

==Research==
The premier professional body in the field is the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]'s (ACM) Special Interest Group (SIG) on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining ([[SIGKDD]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.research.microsoft.com/?SearchDomain=2&amp;SubDomain=7&amp;entitytype=2|title=Microsoft Academic Search: Top conferences in data mining | publisher=[[Microsoft Academic Search]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.de/citations?view_op=top_venues&amp;hl=en&amp;vq=eng_datamininganalysis|title=Google Scholar: Top publications - Data Mining &amp; Analysis|publisher=[[Google Scholar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1989, this ACM SIG has hosted an annual international conference and published its proceedings,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kdd.org/conferences.php Proceedings] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430120252/http://www.kdd.org/conferences.php |date=2010-04-30 }}, International Conferences on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, ACM, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and since 1999 it has published a biannual [[academic journal]] titled "SIGKDD Explorations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kdd.org/explorations/about.php SIGKDD Explorations], ACM, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer science conferences on data mining include:

* [[CIKM Conference]] – ACM [[Conference on Information and Knowledge Management]]
* [[European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases]]
* [[KDD Conference]] – ACM SIGKDD [[Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining]]

Data mining topics are also present on many [[List of computer science conferences#Data Management|data management/database conferences]] such as the ICDE Conference, [[SIGMOD|SIGMOD Conference]] and [[International Conference on Very Large Data Bases]]

==Standards==
There have been some efforts to define standards for the data mining process, for example the 1999 European [[Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining]] (CRISP-DM 1.0) and the 2004 [[Java Data Mining]] standard (JDM 1.0). Development on successors to these processes (CRISP-DM 2.0 and JDM 2.0) was active in 2006, but has stalled since. JDM 2.0 was withdrawn without reaching a final draft.

For exchanging the extracted models – in particular for use in [[predictive analytics]]&amp;nbsp;– the key standard is the [[Predictive Model Markup Language]] (PMML), which is an [[XML]]-based language developed by the Data Mining Group (DMG) and supported as exchange format by many data mining applications. As the name suggests, it only covers prediction models, a particular data mining task of high importance to business applications. However, extensions to cover (for example) [[subspace clustering]] have been proposed independently of the DMG.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Günnemann | first1 = Stephan | last2 = Kremer | first2 = Hardy | last3 = Seidl | first3 = Thomas | doi = 10.1145/2023598.2023605 | chapter = An extension of the PMML standard to subspace clustering models | title = Proceedings of the 2011 workshop on Predictive markup language modeling - PMML '11 | pages = 48 | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-1-4503-0837-3 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable uses==
{{Main|Examples of data mining}}
{{Category see also|Applied data mining}}

Data mining is used wherever there is digital data available today. Notable [[examples of data mining]] can be found throughout business, medicine, science, and surveillance.

==Privacy concerns and ethics==
While the term "data mining" itself may have no ethical implications, it is often associated with the mining of information in relation to peoples' behavior (ethical and otherwise).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Seltzer, William |title=The Promise and Pitfalls of Data Mining: Ethical Issues |url=https://ww2.amstat.org/committees/ethics/linksdir/Jsm2005Seltzer.pdf|publisher = American Statistical Association|journal = ASA Section on Government Statistics|date = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ways in which data mining can be used can in some cases and contexts raise questions regarding privacy, legality, and ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pitts, Chip |title=The End of Illegal Domestic Spying? Don't Count on It |url=http://www.washingtonspectator.com/articles/20070315surveillance_1.cfm |journal=Washington Spectator |date=15 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5SwZyJc43?url=http://www.washingtonspectator.com/articles/20070315surveillance_1.cfm |archivedate=2007-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, data mining government or commercial data sets for national security or law enforcement purposes, such as in the [[Total Information Awareness]] Program or in [[ADVISE]], has raised privacy concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Taipale, Kim A. |title=Data Mining and Domestic Security: Connecting the Dots to Make Sense of Data |url=http://www.stlr.org/cite.cgi?volume=5&amp;article=2 |journal=Columbia Science and Technology Law Review |volume=5 |issue=2 |date=15 December 2003 |ssrn=546782 |oclc=45263753 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Resig|first1=John|title=A Framework for Mining Instant Messaging Services|url=https://johnresig.com/files/research/SIAMPaper.pdf|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data mining requires data preparation which can uncover information or patterns which may compromise confidentiality and privacy obligations. A common way for this to occur is through [[aggregate function|data aggregation]]. Data aggregation involves combining data together (possibly from various sources) in a way that facilitates analysis (but that also might make identification of private, individual-level data deducible or otherwise apparent).&lt;ref name="NASCIO"&gt;[http://www.nascio.org/publications/documents/NASCIO-dataMining.pdf ''Think Before You Dig: Privacy Implications of Data Mining &amp; Aggregation''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217063043/http://www.nascio.org/publications/documents/NASCIO-dataMining.pdf |date=2008-12-17 }}, NASCIO Research Brief, September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This is not data mining ''per se'', but a result of the preparation of data before – and for the purposes of – the analysis. The threat to an individual's privacy comes into play when the data, once compiled, cause the data miner, or anyone who has access to the newly compiled data set, to be able to identify specific individuals, especially when the data were originally anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Ohm |title=Don't Build a Database of Ruin |publisher=Harvard Business Review |url=http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/08/dont_build_a_database_of_ruin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darwin Bond-Graham, [http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/12/03/iron-cagebook/ Iron Cagebook - The Logical End of Facebook's Patents], [[Counterpunch.org]], 2013.12.03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darwin Bond-Graham, [http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/09/11/inside-the-tech-industrys-startup-conference/ Inside the Tech industry's Startup Conference], [[Counterpunch.org]], 2013.09.11&lt;/ref&gt;

It is recommended that an individual is made aware of the following '''before''' data are collected:&lt;ref name="NASCIO" /&gt;
* the purpose of the data collection and any (known) data mining projects;
* how the data will be used;
* who will be able to mine the data and use the data and their derivatives;
* the status of security surrounding access to the data;
* how collected data can be updated.

Data may also be modified so as to ''become'' anonymous, so that individuals may not readily be identified.&lt;ref name="NASCIO" /&gt; However, even "de-identified"/"anonymized" data sets can potentially contain enough information to allow identification of individuals, as occurred when journalists were able to find several individuals based on a set of search histories that were inadvertently released by AOL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.securityfocus.com/brief/277 ''AOL search data identified individuals''], SecurityFocus, August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The inadvertent revelation of [[personally identifiable information]] leading to the provider violates Fair Information Practices.   This indiscretion can cause financial,
emotional, or bodily harm to the indicated individual.  In one instance of privacy violation, the patrons of Walgreens filed a lawsuit against the company in 2011 for selling
prescription information to data mining companies who in turn provided the data
to pharmaceutical companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Big data׳s impact on privacy, security and consumer welfare|journal = Telecommunications Policy|pages = 1134–1145|volume = 38|issue = 11|doi = 10.1016/j.telpol.2014.10.002|first = Nir|last = Kshetri|year = 2014|url = http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/N_Kshetri_Big_2014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situation in Europe===

Europe has rather strong privacy laws, and efforts are underway to further strengthen the rights of the consumers. However, the [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles|U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor Principles]] currently effectively expose European users to privacy exploitation by U.S. companies. As a consequence of [[Edward Snowden]]'s [[global surveillance disclosure]], there has been increased discussion to revoke this agreement, as in particular the data will be fully exposed to the [[National Security Agency]], and attempts to reach an agreement have failed.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Situation in the United States===

In the United States, privacy concerns have been addressed by the [[US Congress]] via the passage of regulatory controls such as the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA). The HIPAA requires individuals to give their "informed consent" regarding information they provide and its intended present and future uses. According to an article in ''Biotech Business Week'', "'[i]n practice, HIPAA may not offer any greater protection than the longstanding regulations in the research arena,' says the AAHC. More importantly, the rule's goal of protection through informed consent is approach a level of incomprehensibility to average individuals."&lt;ref&gt;Biotech Business Week Editors (June 30, 2008); ''BIOMEDICINE; HIPAA Privacy Rule Impedes Biomedical Research'', Biotech Business Week, retrieved 17 November 2009 from LexisNexis Academic&lt;/ref&gt; This underscores the necessity for data anonymity in data aggregation and mining practices.

U.S. information privacy legislation such as HIPAA and the [[Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act]] (FERPA) applies only to the specific areas that each such law addresses. Use of data mining by the majority of businesses in the U.S. is not controlled by any legislation.

==Copyright law==

===Situation in Europe===

Due to a lack of flexibilities in European copyright and [[Database Directive|database law]], the mining of in-copyright works such as [[web mining]] without the permission of the copyright owner is not legal. Where a database is pure data in Europe there is likely to be no copyright, but database rights may exist so data mining becomes subject to regulations by the [[Database Directive]]. On the recommendation of the [[Hargreaves review]] this led to the UK government to amend its copyright law in 2014&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2014/june/researchers-given-data-mining-right-under-new-uk-copyright-laws/ UK Researchers Given Data Mining Right Under New UK Copyright Laws.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609020315/http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2014/june/researchers-given-data-mining-right-under-new-uk-copyright-laws/ |date=June 9, 2014 }} ''Out-Law.com.''   Retrieved 14 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; to allow content mining as a [[Limitations and exceptions to copyright|limitation and exception]]. Only the second country in the world to do so after Japan, which introduced an exception in 2009 for data mining. However, due to the restriction of the [[Copyright Directive]], the UK exception only allows content mining for non-commercial purposes. UK copyright law also does not allow this provision to be overridden by contractual terms and conditions. The [[European Commission]] facilitated stakeholder discussion on text and data mining in 2013, under the title of Licences for Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Licences for Europe - Structured Stakeholder Dialogue 2013|url=http://ec.europa.eu/licences-for-europe-dialogue/en/content/about-site|website=European Commission|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on the solution to this legal issue being licences and not limitations and exceptions led to representatives of universities, researchers, libraries, civil society groups and [[open access]] publishers to leave the stakeholder dialogue in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Text and Data Mining:Its importance and the need for change in Europe|url=http://libereurope.eu/news/text-and-data-mining-its-importance-and-the-need-for-change-in-europe/|website=Association of European Research Libraries|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situation in the United States===

By contrast to Europe, the flexible nature of US copyright law, and in particular [[fair use]] means that content mining in America, as well as other fair use countries such as Israel, Taiwan and South Korea is viewed as being legal. As content mining is transformative, that is it does not supplant the original work, it is viewed as being lawful under fair use. For example, as part of the [[Google Book Search Settlement Agreement|Google Book settlement]] the presiding judge on the case ruled that Google's digitisation project of in-copyright books was lawful, in part because of the transformative uses that the digitisation project displayed - one being text and data mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judge grants summary judgment in favor of Google Books — a fair use victory|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=a18c5b92-5a20-4d1d-a098-a3095046a88e|website=Lexology.com|publisher=Antonelli Law Ltd|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Muhammad}}
The permissibility of '''depictions of Muhammad''' in [[Islam]] has been a contentious issue. Oral and written descriptions of [[Muhammad]] are readily accepted by all traditions of Islam, but there is disagreement about visual depictions.&lt;ref name=best&gt;{{cite journal

Esposito - 2011 p. 14; for hadith see [[Sahih al-Bukhari]], Hadith: 7.834, 7.838, 7.840, 7.844,  7.846&lt;/ref&gt; It is agreed on all sides that there is no authentic visual tradition as to the appearance of Muhammad, although there are early legends of portraits of him, and written physical descriptions whose authenticity is often accepted.

The question of whether images in [[Islamic art]], including those depicting Muhammad, can be considered as [[religious art]] remains a matter of contention among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), p.27&lt;/ref&gt; They appear in illustrated books that are normally works of history or poetry, including those with religious subjects; the Quran is never illustrated: "context and intent are essential to understanding Islamic pictorial art. The Muslim artists creating images of Muhammad, and the public who beheld them, understood that the images were not objects of worship. Nor were the objects so decorated used as part of religious worship".&lt;ref&gt;Cosman, Pelner and Jones, Linda Gale.

However, scholars concede that such images have "a spiritual element", and were also sometimes used in informal religious devotions celebrating the day of the [[Mi'raj]].&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), p.27 (quote) and 43&lt;/ref&gt; Many visual depictions only show Muhammad with his face veiled, or symbolically represent him as a flame; other images, notably from before about 1500, show his face.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2005), pp. 239, 247–253&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="January2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brendan January|title=The Arab Conquests of the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K9XGWkkFy0sC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=14 November 2011|date=1 February 2009|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|isbn=978-0-8225-8744-6|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Safi2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Omid Safi|title=Memories of Muhammad: Why the Prophet Matters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s63i21E9dr8C&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=14 November 2011|date=2 November 2010|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-123135-3|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the notable exception of modern-day Iran,&lt;ref name="GruberHaugbolle2013"/&gt; depictions of Muhammad were rare, never numerous in any community or era throughout Islamic history,&lt;ref name="Arnold"&gt;{{Cite book|publisher = Gorgias Press LLC|isbn = 978-1-931956-91-8|last = Arnold|first = Thomas W.|title = Painting in Islam, a Study of the Place of Pictorial Art in Muslim Culture|orig-year = First published in 1928 |date = 2002–2011|pages = 91–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plas1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dirk van der Plas|title=Effigies dei: essays on the history of religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ops3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=14 November 2011|year=1987|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-08655-5|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared almost exclusively in the private medium of Persian and other [[Persian miniature|miniature]] book illustration.&lt;ref name="Ernst2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ernst|first1=Carl W.|authorlink1=Carl W.

Visual images of Muhammad in the non-Islamic West have always been infrequent. In the Middle Ages they were mostly hostile, and most often appear in illustrations of [[Dante]]'s poetry.  In the Renaissance and Early Modern period, Muhammad was sometimes depicted, typically in a more neutral or heroic light. These depictions began to encounter protests from Muslims, and in the age of the internet, a handful of caricature depictions printed in the European press have caused global protests and controversy, and been associated with violence.

==Background==
{{main|Aniconism in Islam}}
In Islam, although nothing in the [[Quran]] explicitly bans images, some supplemental [[hadith]] explicitly ban the drawing of images of any living creature; other hadith tolerate images, but never encourage them. Hence, most Muslims avoid visual depictions of Muhammad or [[Prophets of Islam|any other prophet]] such as [[Moses]] or [[Abraham]].&lt;ref name=best/&gt;&lt;ref name=USSC&gt;{{cite web|url={{SCOTUS URL|about/north&amp;southwalls.pdf}} |format=PDF|title=Courtroom Friezes: North and South Walls|author=Office of the Curator|date=2003-05-08|accessdate=2007-07-08|work=Information Sheet, Supreme Court of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=explaining&gt;{{cite news|title=Explaining the outrage|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-02-08/news/0602080383_1_prophet-muhammad-cartoons-muslims|date=2006-02-08|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[Sunni]] Muslims believe that visual depictions of all the [[prophets of Islam]] should be prohibited&lt;ref name=Larsson&gt;{{cite book|last=Larsson|first=Göran|title=Muslims and the New Media|year=2011|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-1-4094-2750-6|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are particularly averse to visual representations of Muhammad.&lt;ref name=BergenMuhammad&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/63BsneOUJ?url=http://www.hf.uib.no/religion/popularikonografi/devotion04.html Devotion in pictures: Muslim popular iconography – The prophet Muhammad], [[University of Bergen]]&lt;/ref&gt; The key concern is that the use of images can encourage [[idolatry]].&lt;ref name=Eaton&gt;{{cite book|last=Eaton|first=Charles Le Gai|title=Islam and the destiny of man|year=1985|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-161-5|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shia]] Islam, however, images of Muhammad are quite common nowadays, even though Shia scholars historically were against such depictions.&lt;ref name=BergenMuhammad/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Walker Arnold]] says "It was not merely Sunni schools of law but Shia jurists also who fulminated against this figured art. Because the Persians are Shiites, many Europeans writers have assumed that the Shia sect had not the same objection to representing living being as the rival set of the Sunni; but such an opinion ignores the fact that Shiisum did not become the state church in Persia until the rise of the Safivid dynasty at the beginning of the 16th century."&lt;/ref&gt; Still, many Muslims who take a stricter view of the supplemental traditions will sometimes challenge any depiction of Muhammad, including those created and published by non-Muslims.&lt;ref name=facts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/islam/things/depictions-of-muhammad-in-islamic-art.htm|accessdate=2007-07-06|title=Islamic Figurative Art and Depictions of Muhammad|publisher=religionfacts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some major religions have experienced times during their history when [[aniconism|images of their religious figures were forbidden]]. In Judaism, one of the [[Ten Commandments]] forbids "graven images".  In [[Byzantine]] Christianity during the periods of [[byzantine iconoclasm|Iconoclasm]] in the 8th century, and again during the 9th century, visual representations of sacred figures were forbidden, and only the [[Christian cross|Cross]] could be depicted in churches. The visual representation of Jesus and other religious figures remains a concern in parts of [[Protestant Christianity]].&lt;ref name=Halicks&gt;{{cite news|title=Images of Muhammad: Three ways to see a cartoon|author=Richard Halicks|date=2006-02-12|work=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portraiture of Muhammad in Islamic literature==

A number of ''hadith'' and other writings of the early Islamic period include stories in which portraits of Muhammad appear. [[Abu Hanifa Dinawari]], [[Ibn al-Faqih]], [[Ibn Wahshiyya]] and [[Abu Nu`aym]] tell versions of a story in which the Byzantine Emperor [[Heraclius]] is visited by two Meccans. He shows them a cabinet, handed down to him from [[Alexander the Great]] and originally created by God for Adam, each of whose drawers contains a portrait of a prophet. They are astonished to see a portrait of Muhammad in the final drawer. [[Sadid al-Din al-Kazaruni]] tells a similar story in which the Meccans are visiting the king of China. [[Kisa'i]] tells that God did indeed give portraits of the prophets to Adam.&lt;ref name=Grabar&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grabar|first=Oleg|title=The Story of Portraits of the Prophet Muhammad|journal=Studia Islamica|year=2003|issue=96|pages=19–38|jstor=1596240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Wahshiyya and Abu Nu'ayn tell a second story in which a Meccan merchant visiting Syria is invited to a Christian monastery where a number of sculptures and paintings depict prophets and saints. There he sees the images of Muhammad and Abu Bakr, as yet unidentified by the Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Asani|first=Ali|title=Celebrating Muhammad: Images of the Prophet in Popular Muslim Piety|year=1995|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, SC|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an 11th-century story, Muhammad is said so have sat for a portrait by an artist retained by [[Sassanid]] king [[Kavadh II]]. The king liked the portrait so much that he placed it on his pillow.&lt;ref name=Grabar/&gt;

Later, [[Al-Maqrizi]] tells a story in which [[Muqawqis]], ruler of Egypt, meets with Muhammad's envoy. He asks the envoy to describe Muhammad and checks the description against a portrait of an unknown prophet which he has on a piece of cloth. The description matches the portrait.&lt;ref name=Grabar/&gt;

In a 17th-century [[Islam in China|Chinese]] story, the king of China asks to see Muhammad, but Muhammad instead sends his portrait. The king is so enamoured of the portrait that he is converted to Islam, at which point the portrait, having done its job, disappears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leslie|first=Donald|title=Islam in Traditional China|year=1986|publisher=Canberra College of Advanced Education|location=Canberra|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depiction by Muslims==

===Verbal descriptions===
{{main|Shama'il Muhammadiyah|Hilya}}
[[File:Hilye-i serif 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[hilya|Hilye]]'' by [[Hâfiz Osman]] (1642–1698)]]
In one of the earliest sources, [[Ibn Sa'd]]'s ''Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir'', there are numerous verbal descriptions of Muhammad. One description sourced to [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] is as follows:

: ''The Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, is neither too short nor too tall. His hair are neither curly nor straight, but a mixture of the two. He is a man of black hair and large skull. His complexion has a tinge of redness. His shoulder bones are broad and his palms and feet are fleshy. He has long ''al-masrubah'' which means hair growing from neck to navel. He is of long eye-lashes, close eyebrows, smooth and shining fore-head and long space between two shoulders. When he walks he walks inclining as if coming down from a height. [...] I never saw a man like him before him or after him.''&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Sa'd – ''Kitabh al-Tabaqat al-Kabir'', as translated by S. Moinul and H.K. Ghazanfar, Kitab Bhavan, New Delhi, n.d.{{unreliable source?|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period onwards such texts have been presented on calligraphic ''[[hilya]]'' panels (Turkish: ''hilye'', pl. ''hilyeler''), commonly surrounded by an elaborate frame of [[Ottoman illumination|illuminated decoration]] and either included in books or, more often, [[muraqqa]]s or albums, or sometimes placed in wooden frames so that they can hang on a wall.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2005), p.231-232&lt;/ref&gt;  The elaborated form of the calligraphic tradition was founded in the 17th century by the Ottoman calligrapher [[Hâfiz Osman]]. While containing a concrete and artistically appealing description of Muhammad's appearance, they complied with the strictures against figurative depictions of Muhammad, leaving his appearance to the viewer's imagination.  Several parts of the complex design were named after parts of the body, from the head downwards, indicating the explicit intention of the hilya as a substitute for a figurative depiction.&lt;ref name="Peters2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=F. E. Peters|title=Jesus and Muhammad: Parallel Tracks, Parallel Lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olEi-1LZYYQC&amp;pg=PA160|accessdate=5 November 2011|date=10 November 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-974746-7|pages=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockopp2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan E. Brockopp|title=The Cambridge companion to Muḥammad|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o58K2t344YQC&amp;pg=PA130|accessdate=6 November 2011|date=30 April 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-71372-6|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottoman ''hilye'' format customarily starts with a [[basmala]], shown on top, and is separated in the middle by {{cite quran|21|107|style=ref}}: "And We have not sent you but as a mercy to the worlds".&lt;ref name="Brockopp2010" /&gt; Four compartments set around the central one often contain the names of the [[Rashidun|Rightly-Guided Caliphs]], [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], [[Uthman]], and [[Ali]], each followed by "radhi Allahu anhu" ("may God be pleased with him").

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

===Calligraphic representations===
The most common visual representation of the Muhammad in Islamic art, especially in Arabic-speaking areas, is by a calligraphic representation of his name, a sort of [[monogram]] in roughly circular form, often given a decorated frame. Such inscriptions are normally in Arabic, and may rearrange or repeat forms, or add a blessing or honorific, or for example the word "messenger" or a contraction of it.  The range of ways of representing Muhammad's name is considerable, including [[ambigram]]s; he is also frequently symbolised by a rose.

The more elaborate versions relate to other Islamic traditions of special forms of calligraphy such as those writing the [[Names of God in Islam|names of God]], and the secular [[tughra]] or elaborate monogram of Ottoman rulers.

===Figurative visual depictions===
[[File:Medieval Persian manuscript Muhammad leads Abraham Moses Jesus.jpg|thumb|Muhammad leads [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus]] and others in prayer. Persian miniature]]
Throughout Islamic history, depictions of Muhammad in Islamic art were rare.&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt; Even so, there exists a "notable corpus of images of Muhammad produced, mostly in the form of manuscript illustrations, in various regions of the Islamic world from the thirteenth century through modern times".&lt;ref name="Gruber 2005, p. 240-241"&gt;Gruber (2005), p. 240-241&lt;/ref&gt; Depictions of Muhammad date back to the start of the tradition of [[Persian miniature]]s as illustrations in books. The illustrated book from the [[Persianate]] world (''Warka and Gulshah'', [[Topkapi Palace]] Library H. 841, attributed to [[Konya]] 1200–1250) contains the two earliest known Islamic depictions of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Grabar, p. 19; Gruber (2005), p. 235 (from where the date range), Blair, Sheila S., ''The Development of the Illustrated Book in Iran'', ''Muqarnas'', Vol. 10, Essays in Honor of Oleg Grabar (1993), p. 266, BRILL, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1523191 JSTOR] says "c. 1250"&lt;/ref&gt;

This book dates to before or just around the time of the [[Mongol invasion]] of [[Anatolia]] in the 1240s, and before the campaigns against Persia and Iraq of the 1250s, which destroyed great numbers of books in libraries. Recent scholarship has noted that, although surviving early examples are now uncommon, generally human figurative art was a continuous tradition in Islamic lands (such as in literature, science, and history); as early as the 8th century, such art flourished during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (c. 749 - 1258, across Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Mesopotamia, and Persia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Bloom  |author2=S. Blair |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|pages=192 and 207|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA192&amp;lpg=RA1-PA192&amp;dq=cairo+egypt+miniature+paintings+mamluk#v=onepage&amp;q=cairo%20egypt%20miniature%20paintings%20mamluk&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christiane Gruber traces a development from "veristic" images showing the whole body and face, in the 13th to 15th centuries, to more "abstract" representations in the 16th to 19th centuries, the latter including the representation of Muhammad by a special type of [[calligraphic]] representation, with the older types also remaining in use.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2005), 229, and throughout&lt;/ref&gt;  An intermediate type, first found from about 1400, is the "inscribed portrait" where the face of Muhammad is blank, with "Ya Muhammad" ("O Muhammad") or a similar phrase written in the space instead; these may be related to [[Sufi]] thought.  In some cases the inscription appears to have been an underpainting that would later be covered by a face or veil, so a pious act by the painter, for his eyes alone, but in others it was intended to be seen.&lt;ref name="Gruber 2005, p. 240-241"/&gt; According to Gruber, a good number of these paintings later underwent [[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] mutilations, in which the facial features of Muhammad were scratched or smeared, as Muslim views on the acceptability of veristic images changed.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2005), 229&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of extant Persian manuscripts representing Muhammad date from the [[Ilkhanid]] period under the new [[Mongol]] rulers, including a ''[[Marzubannama]]'' dating to 1299. The Ilkhanid [[MS Arab 161]] of 1307/8 contains 25 illustrations found in an illustrated version of [[Al-Biruni]]'s ''[[The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries]]'', of which five include depictions Muhammad, including the two concluding images, the largest and most accomplished in the manuscript, which emphasize the relation of Muhammad and [[`Ali]] according to [[Shi`ite]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), pp.27-28&lt;/ref&gt; According to Christiane Gruber, other works use images to promote [[Sunni]] Islam, such as a set of Mi'raj illustrations (MS H 2154) in the early 14th century,&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), quote p. 43; generally pp.29-45&lt;/ref&gt; although other historians have dated the same illustrations to the [[Jalayrid]] period of Shia rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Tauris Academic Studies| isbn = 1-84511-499-X| last = Gruber| first = Christiane| title = The Ilkhanid Book of Ascension| date = 2010-03-15| page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Siyer-i Nebi 158b.jpg|thumb|upright|Muhammad, shown with a veiled face and halo, at [[Mount Hira]] (16th-century Ottoman illustration of the [[Siyer-i Nebi]])]]
Depictions of Muhammad are also found in Persian manuscripts in the following [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] and [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] dynasties, and Turkish [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] art in the 14th to 17th centuries, and beyond. Perhaps the most elaborate cycle of illustrations of Muhammad's life is the copy, completed in 1595, of the 14th-century biography ''[[Siyer-i Nebi]]'' commissioned by the Ottoman sultan [[Murat III]] for his son, the future [[Mehmed III]], containing over 800 illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Hürriyet Vakfı Yayınları| last = Tanındı| first = Zeren| title = Siyer-i nebî: İslam tasvir sanatında Hz. Muhammedʹin hayatı| year = 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the commonest narrative scene represented is the [[Mi'raj]]; according to Gruber, "There exist countless single-page paintings of the meʿrāj included in the beginnings of Persian and Turkish romances and epic stories produced from the beginning of the 15th century to the 20th century".&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (Iranica)&lt;/ref&gt;  These images were also used in celebrations of the anniversary of the Mi'raj on 27 [[Rajab]], when the accounts were recited aloud to male groups: "Didactic and engaging, oral stories of the ascension seem to have had the religious goal of inducing attitudes of praise among their audiences".  Such practices are most easily documented in the 18th and 19th centuries, but manuscripts from much earlier appear to have fulfilled the same function.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), p.43&lt;/ref&gt;  Otherwise a large number of different scenes may be represented at times, from Muhammad's birth to the end of his life, and his existence in Paradise.&lt;ref&gt;The birth is rare, but appears in an early manuscript in Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Halo ====
In the earliest depictions Muhammad may be shown with or without a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], the earliest halos being round in the style of Christian art,&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, 95&lt;/ref&gt; but before long a flaming halo or [[aureole]] in the [[Buddhist]] or Chinese tradition becomes more common than the circular form found in the West, when a halo is used.  A halo or flame may surround only his head, but often his whole body, and in some images the body itself cannot be seen for the halo.  This "luminous" form of representation avoided the issues caused by "veristic" images, and could be taken to convey qualities of Muhammad's person described in texts.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, 230, 236&lt;/ref&gt;  If the body is visible, the face may be covered with a veil (see gallery for examples of both types). This form of representation, which began at the start of the [[Safavid]] period in Persia,&lt;ref&gt;Brend, Barbara. ''Islamic Art'', p. 161, British Museum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was done out of reverence and respect.&lt;ref name="Arnold"/&gt; Other [[prophets of Islam]], and Muhammad's wives and relations, may be treated in similar ways if they also appear.

[[Thomas Walker Arnold|T. W. Arnold]] (1864–1930), an early historian of Islamic art, stated that "Islam has never welcomed painting as a handmaid of religion as both Buddhism and Christianity have done. Mosques have never been decorated with religious pictures, nor has a pictorial art been employed for the instruction of the heathen or for the edification of the faithful."&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt; Comparing Islam to Christianity, he also writes: "Accordingly, there has never been any historical tradition in the religious painting of Islam – no artistic development in the representation of accepted types – no schools of painters of religious subjects; least of all has there been any guidance on the part of leaders of religious thought corresponding to that of ecclesiastical authorities in the Christian Church."&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt;

Images of Muhammad remain controversial to the present day, and are not considered acceptable in many countries in the Middle East.  For example, in 1963 an account by a Turkish author of a [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] was banned in [[Pakistan]] because it contained reproductions of miniatures showing Muhammad unveiled.&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel, Annemarie, ''Deciphering the signs of God: a phenomenological approach to Islam'', p.45, n. 86, SUNY Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-7914-1982-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-1982-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary Iran===
[[File:760 - Jeune arabe.jpg|thumb|upright|A colourised version of the original photograph by [[Lehnert &amp; Landrock (disambiguation)|Lehnert &amp; Landrock]], which later became the base of an Iranian depiction of a young Muhammad.]]
Despite the ban on the representation of Muhammad, images of Muhammed are not uncommon in Iran. The Iranian Shi'ism seems more tolerant on this point than Sunnite orthodoxy.&lt;ref name="etudes"/&gt; In Iran, depictions have considerable acceptance to the present day, and may be found in the modern forms of the poster and [[postcard]].&lt;ref name="GruberHaugbolle2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), p.253, illustrates a postcard bought in 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1990s, experts in Islamic iconography discovered images, printed on paper in Iran, portraying Mohammed as a teenager wearing a turban.&lt;ref name="etudes"/&gt; There are several variants, all show the same juvenile face, identified by an inscription such as "Muhammad, the Messenger of God", or a more detailed legend referring to an episode in the life of Muhammad and the supposed origin of the image.&lt;ref name="etudes"/&gt; Some Iranian versions of these posters attributed the original depiction to a [[Bahira]], a Christian monk who met the young Muhammad in Syria. By crediting the image to a Christian and predating it to the time before Muhammad became a prophet, the manufacturers of the image exonerate themselves from any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="iconic"/&gt;

The motif was taken from a photograph of a young Tunisian taken by the Germans [[Rudolf Franz Lehnert]] and [[Ernst Heinrich Landrock]] in 1905 or 1906, which had been printed in high editions on picture post cards till 1921.&lt;ref name="etudes"&gt;Pierre Centlivres, Micheline Centlivres-Demont: [http://etudesphotographiques.revues.org/index747.html Une étrange rencontre. La photographie orientaliste de Lehnert et Landrock et l'image iranienne du prophète Mahomet], ''Études photographiques'' Nr. 17, November 2005 (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; This depiction has been popular in Iran as a form of curiosity.&lt;ref name="iconic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2010/06/11/mohammed/ |title=Mohammed  {{!}} Iconic Photos |publisher=Iconicphotos.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinema===
{{main|List of films about Muhammad|Depictions of Muhammad in film}}
Very few films have been made about Muhammad.  The 1976 film ''The Message'', also known as ''[[Mohammad, Messenger of God]]'', focused on other persons and never directly showed Muhammad or most members of his family.  A devotional cartoon called ''[[Muhammad: The Last Prophet]]'' was released in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finemediagroup.com/user/finemedia/press.cfm|title=Fine Media Group|accessdate=2006-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Iranian film directed by Majid Majidi was released in 2015 named ''[[Muhammad (2015 film)|Muhammad]]''. It is the first part of the trilogy film series on Muhammad by Majid Majidi.

While [[Sunni]] Muslims have always explicitly prohibited the depiction of Muhammad on film,&lt;ref name=fatwa_important&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alessandra. Raengo  |author2=Robert Stam  |lastauthoramp=yes |title = A Companion To Literature And Film |publisher = Blackwell Publishing |year = 2004|isbn=0-631-23053-X |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; contemporary [[Shi'a]] scholars have taken a more relaxed attitude, stating that it is permissible to depict Muhammad, even in television or movies, if done with respect.&lt;ref name=sistani&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sistani.org/html/eng/menu/4/?lang=eng&amp;view=d&amp;code=234&amp;page=1 |title=Istifta |accessdate=2006-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017223013/http://www.sistani.org/html/eng/menu/4/?lang=eng&amp;view=d&amp;code=234&amp;page=1 |archivedate=2006-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depiction by non-Muslims==
{{Commons category|Western depictions of Muhammad}}
Western representations of Muhammad were very rare until the explosion of images following the invention of the [[printing press]]; he is shown in a few medieval images, normally in an unflattering manner, often influenced by his brief mention in [[Dante|Dante's]] ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.  Muhammad sometimes figures in Western depictions of groups of influential people in world history. Such depictions tend to be favourable or neutral in intent; one example can be found at the [[United States Supreme Court building#Sculptural program|United States Supreme Court building]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. Created in 1935, the frieze includes major historical lawgivers, and places Muhammad alongside [[Hammurabi]], [[Moses]], [[Confucius]], and others. In 1997, a controversy erupted surrounding the frieze, and tourist materials have since been edited to describe the depiction as "a well-intentioned attempt by the sculptor to honor Muhammad" that "bears no resemblance to Muhammad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrepublican.com/sup_crt_frieze.html|title=The Daily Republican: Supreme Court Frieze|accessdate=2006-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, a statue of Muhammad was removed from a courthouse in New York City after the ambassadors of [[Indonesia]], Pakistan, and [[Egypt]] requested its removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourmailinglistprovider.com/pubarchive_show_message.php?montrealmuslimnews+7289|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130210055800/http://www.yourmailinglistprovider.com/pubarchive_show_message.php?montrealmuslimnews+7289|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-02-10|accessdate=2006-03-10|date=2006-02-12|title=Archive "Montreal News Network": Images of Muhammad, Gone for Good}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extremely rare representations of Muhammad in [[monumental sculpture]] are especially likely to be offensive to Muslims, as the statue is the classic form for idols, and a fear of any hint of idolatry is the basis of Islamic prohibitions. Islamic art has almost always avoided large sculptures of any subject, especially free-standing ones; only a few animals are known, mostly fountain-heads, like those in the Lion Court of the [[Alhambra]]; the [[Pisa Griffin]] is perhaps the largest.

In 1997, the [[Council on American–Islamic Relations]], a Muslim advocacy group in the United States, wrote to United States Supreme Court Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] requesting that the sculpted representation of [[Muhammad]] on the north frieze inside the Supreme Court building be removed or sanded down. The court rejected CAIR's request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/other/how-the-%e2%80%9cban%e2%80%9d-on-images-of-muhammad-came-to-be/ar-AA8lQj0 MSN : "How the “Ban” on Images of Muhammad Came to Be" by Jackie Bischof]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526045614/http://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/other/how-the-%E2%80%9Cban%E2%80%9D-on-images-of-muhammad-came-to-be/ar-AA8lQj0 |date=May 26, 2015 }} January 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been numerous book illustrations showing Muhammad.

[[Dante]], in ''[[The Divine Comedy#Inferno|The Divine Comedy: Inferno]]'', placed Muhammad in Hell, with his entrails hanging out (Canto 28):

:No barrel, not even one where the hoops and staves go every which way, was ever split open like one frayed Sinner I saw, ripped from chin to where we fart&lt;!-- this is the actual quotation; do not remove--&gt; below.
:His guts hung between his legs and displayed His vital organs, including that wretched sack Which converts to shit&lt;!-- this is the actual quotation; do not remove --&gt; whatever gets conveyed down the gullet.
:As I stared at him he looked back And with his hands pulled his chest open, Saying, ''"See how I split open the crack in myself! See how twisted and broken Mohammed is! Before me walks [[Ali]], his face Cleft from chin to crown, grief–stricken."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Seth Zimmerman|title=The Inferno of Dante Alighieri |page=191 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r3hWDEjN7JcC&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=2003 |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=0-595-28090-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This scene was sometimes shown in illustrations of the ''[[The Divine Comedy|Divina Commedia]]'' before modern times. Muhammad is represented in a 15th-century [[fresco]] ''[[Last Judgement]]'' by [[Giovanni da Modena]] and drawing on Dante, in the [[Church of San Petronio]], [[Bologna, Italy]].&lt;ref name=fresco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,11711,742914,00.html|title=Al-Qaida plot to blow up Bologna church fresco|date=2002-06-24|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Philip Willan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and artwork by [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[William Blake]], and [[Gustave Doré]].&lt;ref name=Chronicle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/02/11/MNGRCH6UQK1.DTL|title=What's behind Muslim cartoon outrage|date=2006-02-11|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|author=Ayesha Akram}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies in the 21st century==
The start of the 21st century has been marked by controversies over depictions of Muhammad, not only for recent caricatures or cartoons, but also regarding the display of historical artwork.

[[File:Mohammeds Berufung, Hosemann 1847.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Die Berufung Mohammeds durch den Engel Gabriel'' by [[Theodor Hosemann]], 1847, published by ''Spiegel'' in 1999]]
In a story on morals at the end of the millennium in December 1999, the German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' printed on the same page pictures of “moral apostles” Muhammad, [[Jesus]], [[Confucius]], and [[Immanuel Kant]]. In the subsequent weeks, the magazine received protests, petitions and threats against publishing the picture of Muhammad. The Turkish TV-station [[Show TV]] broadcast the telephone number of an editor who then received daily calls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-15613871.html Terror am Telefon], ''Spiegel'', February 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Nadeem Elyas, leader of the [[Central Council of Muslims in Germany]] said that the picture should not be printed again in order to avoid hurting the feelings of Muslims intentionally. Elyas recommended to whiten the face of Muhammad instead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carolin Emcke]]: [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-15613870.html Fanatiker sind leicht verführbar], Interview with Nadeem Elyas, February 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2001, the ''Spiegel'' with consideration of Islamic laws published a picture of Muhammed with a whitened face on its title page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45774322.html, 6.

In 2002, Italian police reported that they had disrupted a terrorist plot to destroy a church in [[Bologna]], which contains a 15th-century [[fresco]] depicting an image of Muhammad (see above).&lt;ref name=fresco/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2D9163CF931A1575BC0A9649C8B63|title=Italy frees Fresco Suspects|date=2002-08-22|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Danish newspaper ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' published a set of [[editorial cartoons]], many of which depicted Muhammad. In late 2005 and early 2006, Danish Muslim organizations ignited a [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|controversy]] through public protests and by spreading knowledge of the publication of the cartoons.&lt;ref name=Halicks/&gt; According to John Woods, Islamic history professor at the University of Chicago, it was not simply the depiction of Muhammad that was offensive, but the implication that Muhammad was somehow a supporter of terrorism.&lt;ref name=explaining/&gt; In Sweden, an online caricature competition was announced in support of ''Jyllands-Posten'', but Foreign Affairs Minister [[Laila Freivalds]] and the [[Swedish Security Service]] pressured the [[internet service provider]] to shut the page down. In 2006, when her involvement was revealed to the public, she had to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L21470789.htm |title=Swedish foreign minister resigns over cartoons |work=Reuters AlertNet |accessdate=2006-03-21 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060322184626/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L21470789.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 22 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 February 2008 the Danish police arrested three men alleged to be involved in a plot to assassinate [[Kurt Westergaard]], one of the cartoonists.&lt;ref&gt;Staff.

[[File:South park muhammad.jpg|thumb|Muhammad appeared in the 2001 ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Super Best Friends]]". The image was later removed from the 2006 episode "[[Cartoon Wars Part II|Cartoon Wars]]" and the 2010 episodes "[[200 (South Park)|200]]" and "[[201 (South Park)|201]]" due to controversies regarding Muhammad cartoons in European newspapers.]]
In 2006, the controversial American [[animated]] television comedy program ''[[South Park]]'', which had previously depicted Muhammad as a [[superhero]] character in the July 4, 2001 episode "[[Super Best Friends]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Super Best Friends | episodelink = Super Best Friends | series = South Park | serieslink = South Park | airdate = 2001-07-04 | season = 5 | number = 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has depicted Muhammad in the opening sequence since that episode,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/04/15/south-parks-been-showing-muhammad-all-season/ |title=Ryan j Budke.

In the episode, "[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]", they intended to show Muhammad handing a salmon helmet to [[Peter Griffin]], a character from the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] animated series ''[[Family Guy]]''. However, [[Comedy Central]], who airs ''South Park'', rejected the scene, citing concerns of violent protests in the [[Islamic world]]. The creators of ''South Park'' reacted by instead satirizing Comedy Central's [[double standard]] for broadcast acceptability by including a segment of "Cartoon Wars Part II" in which [[President of the United States|American president]] [[George W. Bush]] and [[Jesus]] defecate on the [[flag of the United States]].

The [[Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy]] began in July 2007 with a series of drawings by [[Sweden|Swedish]] artist [[Lars Vilks]] which depicted Muhammad as a [[roundabout dog]]. Several art galleries in Sweden declined to show the drawings, citing security concerns and fear of violence. The controversy gained international attention after the [[Örebro]]-based regional newspaper ''[[Nerikes Allehanda]]'' published one of the drawings on August 18 to illustrate an [[editorial]] on [[self-censorship]] and [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref name=na&gt;{{cite news |first=Lars |last=Ströman |title=Rätten att förlöjliga en religion |url=http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209627 |publisher=[[Nerikes Allehanda]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-08-18 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070906190721/http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209627 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-06}}&lt;br/&gt;English translation: {{cite news |first=Lars |last=Ströman |title=The right to ridicule a religion |url=http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209676 |publisher=[[Nerikes Allehanda]] |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070830163657/http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209676 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another controversy emerged in September 2007 when [[Bangladesh]]i cartoonist [[Arifur Rahman]] was detained on suspicion of showing disrespect to Muhammad.  The interim government confiscated copies of the [[Bengali language|Bengali]]-language ''[[Prothom Alo]]'' in which the drawings appeared. The cartoon consisted of a boy holding a cat conversing with an elderly man.  The man asks the boy his name, and he replies "Babu". The older man chides him for not mentioning the name of Muhammad before his name.

He then points to the cat and asks the boy what it is called, and the boy replies "Muhammad the cat". The cartoon caused a firestorm in Bangladesh, with militant [[Islamists]] demanding that Rahman be executed for [[blasphemy]]. A group of people [[book burning|torched copies of the paper]] and several Islamic groups protested, saying the drawings ridiculed Mohammad and his companions. They demanded "exemplary punishment" for the paper's editor and the cartoonist. Bangladesh does not have a [[blasphemy law]], although one had been demanded by the same extremist Islamic groups.

On November 2, 2010, the office of the French satirical weekly newspaper ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' at Paris was attacked with a firebomb and its website hacked, after it had announced plans to publish a special edition with Muhammad as its “chief editor”, and the title page with a cartoon of Muhammad had been pre-issued on social media.

In September 2012, the newspaper published a series of satirical cartoons of Muhammad, some of which feature nude caricatures of him. In January 2013, ''Charlie Hebdo'' announced that they would make a [[comic book]] on the life of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Jerome|title=It's Charlie Hebdo's right to draw Muhammad, but they missed the opportunity to do something profound|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/its-charlie-hebdos-right-to-draw-muhammad-but-they-missed-the-opportunity-to-do-something-profound-8435693.html|accessdate=12 October 2014|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, Al-Qaeda's branch in Yemen, commonly known as [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]] (AQAP), released a hit list in an edition of their English-language magazine ''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]]''.

The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in January 2010 confirmed to the ''[[New York Post]]'' that it had quietly removed all historic paintings which contained depictions of Muhammad from public exhibition. The Museum quoted objections on the part of conservative Muslims which were "under review."  The museum's action was criticized as excessive [[political correctness]], as were other decisions taken close to the same time, including the renaming of the "Primitive Art Galleries" to the "Arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas" and the projected "Islamic Galleries" to "Arab Lands, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia and Later South Asia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/jihad_jitters_at_met_76yj3VNUy4hcRAnhOcPCHP 'Jihad' jitters at Met – Mohammed art gone] by Isabel Vincent, 10 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Everybody Draw Mohammed Day was a protest against those who threatened violence against artists who drew representations of Muhammad. It began as a protest against the action of [[Comedy Central]] in forbidding the broadcast of the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[201 (South Park)|201]]" in response to [[death threat]]s against some of those responsible for the segment. Observance of the day began with a drawing posted on the [[Internet]] on April 20, 2010, accompanied by text suggesting that "everybody" create a drawing representing Muhammad, on May 20, 2010, as a protest against efforts to limit [[freedom of speech]].

The '''Efficiency Movement''' was a major movement in the United States, Britain and other industrial nations in the early 20th century that sought to identify and eliminate waste in all areas of the economy and society, and to develop and implement best practices.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel T. Rodgers, ''Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The concept covered mechanical, economic, social, and personal improvement.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Haber, ''Efficiency and Uplift: Scientific Management in the Progressive Era, 1890–1920'' (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; The quest for efficiency promised effective, dynamic management rewarded by growth.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer K. Alexander, ''The Mantra of Efficiency: From Waterwheel to Social Control'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the influence of an early proponent, it is more often known as [[Taylorism]].

==United States==
The Efficiency Movement played a central role in the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States, where it flourished 1890–1932.&lt;ref&gt;Haber (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents argued that all aspects of the economy, society and government were riddled with waste and inefficiency.  Everything would be better if experts identified the problems and fixed them.  The result was strong support for building research universities and schools of business and engineering, municipal research agencies, as well as reform of hospitals and medical schools, and the practice of farming.&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Spillman, "The Efficiency Movement in Its Relation to Agriculture," ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,'' Vol. 59, (May, 1915), pp. 65–76 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1012894 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the best known leaders were engineers [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] (1856–1915), who used a stopwatch to identify the smallest inefficiencies, and [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.]] (1868–1924) who proclaimed there was always "one best way" to fix a problem.

Leaders such as [[Herbert Croly]], [[Charles R. van Hise]] and [[Richard T. Ely|Richard Ely]] sought to improve governmental performance by training experts in public service comparable to those in Germany, notably at the Universities of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Schools of business administration set up management programs oriented toward efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Morris, "The Wisconsin Idea and Business Progressivism," ''Journal of American Studies,'' April 1970, Vol. 4#1 pp 39–60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Municipal and state efficiency===
Many cities set up "efficiency bureaus" to identify waste and apply the best practices.  For example, Chicago created an Efficiency Division (1910–16) within the city government's Civil Service Commission, and private citizens organized the Chicago Bureau of Public Efficiency (1910–32).  The former pioneered the study of "personal efficiency," measuring employees' performance through new scientific merit systems and efficiency movement &lt;ref&gt;Mordecai Lee, ''Bureaus of Efficiency: Reforming Local Government in the Progressive Era,'' (Marquette University Press, 2008) {{ISBN|978-0-87462-081-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State governments were active as well. For example, Massachusetts set up its "Commission on Economy and Efficiency" in 1912.  It made hundreds of recommendations.&lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;Commission on Economy and Efficiency, ''Annual report of the Commission on Economy and Efficiency'' (Boston, 1913), p 76 [https://books.google.com/books?id=dWQNAAAAYAAJ  online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy===
Leading philanthropists such as [[Andrew Carnegie]]&lt;ref&gt;Abigail A. Van Slyck, ''Free to All: Carnegie Libraries &amp; American Culture, 1890–1920'' (1998) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John D. Rockefeller]] actively promoted the efficiency movement.  In his many philanthropic pursuits, Rockefeller believed in supporting efficiency.  He once said,
:"To help an inefficient, ill-located, unnecessary school is a waste ...it is highly probable that enough money has been squandered on unwise educational projects to have built up a national system of higher education adequate to our needs, if the money had been properly directed to that end."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/17090 John D. Rockefeller, ''Random Reminiscences of Men and Events'' (1933)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation===
The [[Conservation in the United States|conservation movement]] regarding national resources came to prominence during the Progressive Era.  According to historian [[Samuel P. Hays]], the conservation movement was based on the "gospel of the efficiency.".&lt;ref&gt;Samuel P. Hays, ''Conservation and the Gospel of Efficiency: The Progressive Conservation Movement 1890–1920'' (1959).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Massachusetts Commission on Economy and Efficiency reflected the new concern with conservation. It said in 1912:
:"The only proper basis for the protection of game birds, wild fowl and, indeed, all animals is an economic one, and must be based upon carefully constructed and properly enforced laws for the conservation of all species for the benefit of future generations of our citizens, rather than based on local opinion....This expenditure for the protection of fish and game is clearly a wise economy, tending to prevent the annihilation of birds and other animals valuable to mankind which might otherwise become extinct.  It may be said that Massachusetts and her sister States have suffered irreparable loss by carelessly allowing, for generations past, indiscriminate waste of animal life."&lt;ref name="books.google" /&gt;

[[Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] was the nation's foremost conservationist, putting the issue high on the national agenda by emphasizing the need to eliminate wasteful uses of limited natural resources. He worked with all the major figures of the movement, especially his chief advisor on the matter,  [[Gifford Pinchot]].  Roosevelt was deeply committed to conserving natural resources, and is considered to be the nation's first [[conservation biology|conservation]] President.&lt;ref&gt;W. Todd Benson, ''President Theodore Roosevelt's Conservation Legacy'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:TR-Enviro.JPG|thumb|325px|left|1908 US editorial cartoon on Theodore Roosevelt and conservation]]

In 1908, Roosevelt sponsored the [[Conference of Governors]] held in the White House, with a focus on natural resources and their most efficient use. Roosevelt delivered the opening address: "Conservation as a National Duty."

In contrast, environmentalist [[John Muir]] promulgated a very different view of conservation, rejecting the efficiency motivation. Muir instead preached that nature was sacred and humans are intruders who should look but not develop. Working through the [[Sierra Club]] he founded, Muir tried to minimize commercial use of water resources and forests.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Nash, ''Wilderness and the American Mind'' (3rd ed. 1982), pp 122–40&lt;/ref&gt;  While Muir wanted nature preserved for the sake of pure beauty, Roosevelt subscribed to Pinchot's formulation, "to make the forest produce the largest amount of whatever crop or service will be most useful, and keep on producing it for generation after generation of men and trees." &lt;ref&gt;Gifford Pinchot, ''Breaking New Ground,'' (1947) p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===National politics===
In U.S. national politics, the most prominent figure was [[Herbert Hoover]], a trained engineer who downplayed politics and believed dispassionate, nonpolitical experts could solve the nation's great problems, such as ending poverty.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Barber, ''From new era to New Deal: Herbert Hoover, the economists, and American economic policy, 1921–1933'' (1989) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks on efficiency===
After 1929, [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] blamed the [[Great Depression]] on Hoover and helped to somewhat discredit the movement, though the demand for efficiency and elimination of waste remains an important component of American values.

===Antitrust===
Boston lawyer [[Louis Brandeis]] (1856–1941) argued bigness conflicted with efficiency and added a new political dimension to the Efficiency Movement. For instance, while fighting against legalized price fixing, Brandeis launched an effort to influence congressional policymaking with the help of his friend [[Norman Hapgood]], who was then the editor of [[Harper's Weekly]]. He coordinated the publication of a series of articles (''Competition Kills'', ''Efficiency and the One-Price Article'', and ''How Europe deals with the one-price goods''), which were also distributed by the lobbying group American Fair Trade League to legislators, [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] justices, governors, and twenty national magazines.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prophets of Regulation|last=McCraw|first=Thomas|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2009|isbn=0674716086|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=103-104}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his works, he was asked to speak before a congressional committee considering the price-fixing bill he drafted. Here, he stated that "big business is not more efficient than little business" and that "it is a mistake to suppose that the department stores can do business cheaper than the little dealer."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Brandeis ideas on which business is most efficient conflicted with Croly's positions, which favored efficiency driven by a kind of consolidation gained through large-scale economic operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Herbert Croly of the New Republic: The Life and Thought of an American Progressive|last=Levy|first=David|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1985|isbn=0691047251|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=157-158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1895 Brandeis had warned of the harm that giant corporations could do to competitors, customers, and their own workers. The growth of industrialization was creating mammoth companies which he felt threatened the well-being of millions of Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin I. Urofsky, ''Louis D. Brandeis: a life'' (2009) pp 300–26&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''The Curse of Bigness'' he argued, "Efficiency means greater production with less effort and at less cost, through the elimination of unnecessary waste, human and material. How else can we hope to attain our social ideals?."&lt;ref&gt;Louis Brandeis, ''The curse of bigness: miscellaneous papers of Louis D. Brandeis'' edited by Osmond Kessler Fraenkel and Clarence Martin Lewis, (1965) p 51&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued against an appeal to Congress by the state-regulated railroad industry in 1910 seeking an increase in rates. Brandeis explained that instead of passing along increased costs to the consumer, the railroads should pursue efficiency by reducing their overhead and streamlining their operations, initiatives that were unprecedented during the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Efficient Society: Why Canada Is As Close To Utopia As It Gets|last=Heath|first=Joseph|publisher=Penguin Canada|year=2002|isbn=0140292489|location=Toronto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Bedaux system===
The Bedaux system, developed by Franco-American [[management consultant]] [[Charles Bedaux]] (1886–1944) built on the work of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|F.W. Taylor]] and [[Charles Edward Knoeppel|Charles E. Knoeppel]].&lt;ref name=Brech&gt;[[Edward Francis Leopold Brech]], ''Productivity in Perspective, 1914-1974'' (Bristol: Thoemmes Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weatherburn&gt;Michael R. Weatherburn, 'Scientific Management at Work: the Bedaux System, Management Consulting, and Worker Efficiency in British Industry, 1914-48' (Imperial College PhD thesis, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Its distinctive advancement beyond these earlier thinkers was the [[Bedaux Unit]] or ''B'', a universal measure for all manual work.&lt;ref name=Littler&gt;Craig R. Littler, ''Development of the Labour Process in Capitalist Societies:  a Comparative Study of the Transformation of Work Organization in Britain, Japan and the USA'' (London: Heinemann, 1982) [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_development_of_the_labour_process_in.html?id=2k2yAAAAIAAJ entry on Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;

The Bedaux System was influential in the [[United States]] in the 1920s and [[Europe]] in the 1930s and 1940s, especially in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].&lt;ref name=KreisADNB&gt;Steven Kreis, 'Charles E. Bedaux' in ''[[American National Biography]]'' [http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.1000116 online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Link"&gt;Steven Kreis, 'The Diffusion of Scientific Management: the Bedaux Company in America and Britain, 1926-1945' in ''A Mental Revolution: Scientific Management Since Taylor'' (1992) {{cite web|url= https://ohiostatepress.org/books/Complete%20PDFs/Nelson%20Mental/08.pdf |title=Link }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1920s to the 1950s there were about one thousand companies in 21 countries worldwide that were run on the Bedaux System, including giants such as [[Swift's]], [[Eastman Kodak]], [[Goodrich Corporation|B.F. Goodrich]], [[DuPont]], [[Fiat]], [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] and [[General Electric]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Tisdall, ''Agents of Change: The Development and Practice of Management Consultancy'' (London: Heinemann, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Link" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Kipping, 'Consultancies, Institutions and the Diffusion of Taylorism in Britain, Germany and France, 1920s to 1950s', ''Business History'' (1997) [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00076799700000146 PDF from Taylor &amp; Francis online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ferguson, ''The Rise of Management Consulting in Britain'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mckenna&gt;'Christopher D. McKenna, ''The World's Newest Profession: Management Consulting in the Twentieth Century'' (Cambridge: CUP, 2010). [http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/history/american-history-after-1945/worlds-newest-profession-management-consulting-twentieth-century Cambridge University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to other movements===
Later movements had echoes of the Efficiency Movement and were more directly inspired by Taylor and [[Taylorism]].  [[Technocracy movement|Technocracy]], for instance, more of a fad than a movement, and others flourished in the 1930s and 1940s.

Postmodern opponents of nuclear energy in the 1970s broadened their attack to try to discredit movements that saw salvation for human society in technical expertise alone, or which held that scientists or engineers had any special expertise to offer in the political realm.

Coming into usage in 1990, the Western term [[Lean manufacturing]] (lean enterprise, lean production, or simply "Lean") refers to a business idea that considered the expenditure of resources for anything other than the creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful, and thus a target for elimination. Today the Lean concept is broadening to include a greater range of strategic goals, not just cost-cutting and efficiency.

==Britain==
In engineering, the concept of efficiency was developed in Britain in the mid-18th century by [[John Smeaton]] (1724–1792). Called the "father of civil engineering", he studied water wheels and steam engines.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander (2008) ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 19th century there was much talk about improving the efficiency of the administration and economic performance of the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold White, ''Efficiency and empire'' (1901) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ANUBAAAAMAAJ  online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Efficiency''' was an attempt to discredit the old-fashioned habits, customs and institutions that put the British at a handicap in competition with the world, especially with Germany,&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Dawson, ''The German Workman: a Study in National Efficiency'' (1906) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HoxNAAAAMAAJ online]&lt;/ref&gt; which was seen as the epitome of efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. R. Searle]], ''The Quest for National Efficiency, 1899–1914: A Study in Politics and Political Thought'' (Oxford UP, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, "National Efficiency" became a powerful demand&amp;nbsp;— a  movement supported by prominent figures across the political spectrum who disparaged sentimental humanitarianism and identified waste as a mistake that could no longer be tolerated.  The movement took place in two waves; the first wave from 1899 to 1905 was made urgent by the inefficiencies and failures in the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902).  ''Spectator'' magazine reported in 1902 there was "a universal outcry for efficiency in all departments of society, in all aspects of life".&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Searle, "The Politics of National Efficiency and of War, 1900–1918" in Chris Wrigley, ed.,  ''A Companion to Early 20th-Century Britain'' (Blackwell, 2003) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;  The two most important themes were technocratic efficiency and managerial efficiency.  As White (1899) argued vigorously, the empire needed to be put on a business footing and administered to get better results.  The looming threat of Germany, which was widely seen as a much more efficient nation, added urgency after 1902.  Politically National Efficiency brought together modernizing Conservatives and Unionists, Liberals who wanted to bring modernize their party, and [[Fabian Society|Fabians]] such as [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[H. G. Wells]], along with [[Beatrice Webb|Beatrice]] and [[Sidney Webb]], who had outgrown socialism and saw the utopia of a scientifically up-to-date society supervised by experts such as themselves.  Churchill in 1908 formed an alliance with the Webbs, announcing the goal of a "National Minimum", covering hours, working conditions, and wages&amp;nbsp;– it was a safety net below which the individual would not be allowed to fall.&lt;ref&gt;James T. Kloppenberg, ''Uncertain Victory: Social Democracy and Progressivism in European and American Thought, 1870–1920'' (1988) p 475&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Pelling, ''Winston Churchill'' (1989) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative legislation included the [[Education Act 1902|Education Act of 1902]], which emphasized the role of experts in the schools system.  Higher education was an important initiative, typified by the growth of the [[London School of Economics]], and the foundation of [[Imperial College]].&lt;ref&gt;Searle (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a pause in the movement between 1904 and 1909, when interest resumed.  The most prominent new leaders included Liberals [[Winston Churchill]] and [[David Lloyd George]], whose influence brought a bundle of reform legislation that introduced the welfare state to Britain.

Much of the popular and elite support for National Efficiency grew out of concern for Britain's military position, especially with respect to Germany.  The Royal Navy underwent a dramatic modernization, most famously in the introduction of the ''[[Dreadnought]]'', which in 1906 revolutionized naval warfare overnight.

==Germany==
In Germany the efficiency movement was called "rationalization" and it was a powerful social and economic force before 1933. In part it looked explicitly at American models, especially [[Fordism]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary Nolan, "Housework Made Easy: the Taylorized Housewife in Weimar Germany's Rationalized Economy," ''Feminist Studies.'' Volume: 16. Issue: 3. pp 549+&lt;/ref&gt; The Bedaux system was widely adopted in the rubber and tire industry, despite strong resistance in the socialist labor movement to the Bedaux system. [[Continental AG]], the leading rubber company in Germany, adopted the system and profited heavily from it, thus surviving the Great Depression relatively undamaged and improving its competitive capabilities. However most German businessmen preferred the home-grown '''REFA system''' which focused on the standardization of working conditions, tools, and machinery.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Erker, "Das Bedaux-System: Neue Aspekte der Historischen Rationalisierungsforschung,["The Bedaux system: new aspects of research on the history of rationalization"], ''Zeitschrift für Unternehmensgeschichte,'' 1996, Vol. 41#2 pp 139–158&lt;/ref&gt;

"Rationalization" meant higher productivity and greater efficiency, promising science would bring prosperity. More generally it promised a new level of modernity and was applied to economic production and consumption as well as public administration. Various versions of rationalization were promoted by industrialists and Social Democrats, by engineers and architects, by educators and academics, by middle class feminists and social workers, by government officials and politicians of many parties. It was ridiculed by the extremists in the Communist movement. As ideology and practice, rationalization challenged and transformed not only machines, factories, and vast business enterprises but also the lives of middle-class and working-class Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Nolan (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet Union==
Ideas of Science Management was very popular in the Soviet Union. One of the leading theorists and practitioners of the Scientific Management in Soviet Russia was [[Alexei Gastev]]. The [[Central Institute of Labour]] (Tsentralnyi Institut Truda, or TsIT), founded by Gastev in 1921 with [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s support, was a veritable citadel of socialist Taylorism.
Fascinated by Taylorism and Fordism, Gastev has led a popular movement for the “scientific organization of labor” (Nauchnaya Organizatsiya Truda, or NOT).
Because of its emphasis on the cognitive components of labor, some scholars consider Gastev’s NOT to represent a [[Karl Marx|Marxian]] variant of cybernetics. As with the concept of 'Organoprojection' (1919) by [[Pavel Florensky]], underlying [[Nikolai Bernstein]] and Gastev's approach, lay a powerful man-machine metaphor.

==Japan==
[[W. Edwards Deming]] (1900–1993) brought the efficiency movement to Japan after World War II, teaching top management how to improve design (and thus service), product quality, testing and sales (the last through global markets), especially using statistical methods.  Deming then brought his methods back to the U.S. in the form of quality control called [[continuous improvement process]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Gabor, ''The Man Who Discovered Quality: How W. Edwards Deming Brought the Quality Revolution to America'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

The granularity of FRUs in a system impacts [[total cost of ownership]] and support, including the costs of stocking [[spare part]]s, where spares are deployed to meet repair time goals, how diagnostic tools are designed and implemented, levels of training for field personnel, whether end-users can do their own FRU replacement, etc.

==Other equipment==
FRUs are not strictly confined to computers but are also part of many high-end, lower-volume consumer and commercial products. For example, in military aviation, electronic components of [[line-replaceable unit]]s, typically known as [[shop-replaceable unit]]s (SRUs), are repaired at field-service [[backshop]]s, usually by a "remove and replace" repair procedure, with specialized repair performed at centralized depot or by the [[original equipment manufacturer|OEM]].

==History==
Many [[vacuum tube]] computers had FRUs:
*[[Pluggable unit]]s containing one or more [[vacuum tube]]s and various [[passive component]]s

Most [[transistor]]ized and [[integrated circuit]]-based computers had FRUs:
*[[Computer module]]s, circuit boards containing discrete transistors and various passive components. Examples:
**[[IBM Standard Modular System|IBM SMS cards]]
**[[System Building Blocks|DEC System Building Blocks]] cards
**[[Flip Chip (PDP module)|DEC Flip-Chip]] cards
*Circuit boards containing monolithic ICs and/or [[hybrid integrated circuit|hybrid ICs]], such as [[IBM Solid Logic Technology|IBM SLT cards]].

Vacuum tubes themselves are usually FRUs.

For a short period starting in the late 1960s, some [[television set]] manufacturers made solid-state televisions with FRUs instead of a single board attached to the chassis. However modern televisions put all the electronics on one large board to reduce manufacturing costs.

==Trends==
As the sophistication and complexity of multi-replaceable unit electronics in both commercial and consumer industries have increased, many design and manufacturing organizations have expanded the use of the FRU storage device. Storage is no longer limited to simply identification of the FRU itself, but now also comprises back-up copies of critical system information such as system serial numbers, MAC address and even security information. Some systems will fail to function at all without each FRU in the system being ratified at start-up. Today one cannot assume that the FRU storage device is only used to maintain the FRU ID of the part.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8901">A '''flood opening''' or '''flood vent''' (also styled '''floodvent''') is an orifice in an enclosed structure intended to allow the free passage of water between the interior and exterior.

==Flood openings in the United States==
In the [[United States]], flood openings are used to provide for the automatic equalization of [[hydrostatic pressure]] on either side of a wall. [[Building codes]] usually require the installation of flood openings in the walls of structures located in [[100-year flood|A-type flood zone]]s recognized by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]. Various agencies in the United States define necessary characteristics for flood openings. The NFIP Regulations and Building Codes require that any residential building constructed in Flood Zone Type A have the lowest floor, including basements, elevated to or above the Base Flood Elevation (BFE). Enclosed areas are permitted under elevated buildings provided that they meet certain use restrictions and construction requirements such as the installation of flood vents to allow for the automatic entry and exit of flood waters. This wet floodproofing technique is required for residential buildings.

===Engineered vs. non-engineered openings===
Most regulatory authorities in the United States that offer requirements for flood openings define two major classes of opening:&lt;ref name="codes"&gt;[http://www.fema.gov/rebuild/buildingscience/coderesources.shtm FEMA: Building Code Resources]&lt;/ref&gt; engineered, and non-engineered. The requirements for non-engineered openings are typically stricter, defining necessary characteristics for aspects ranging from overall size of each opening, to allowable screening or other coverage options, to number and placement of openings. Engineered openings ignore many of these requirements, depending on the particular regulatory authority. To qualify as an engineered opening, testing and/or certification by a qualified agency (varying from regulator to regulator, and indicated below where appropriate) is required.

Non-Engineered Opening WARNING: "Any louvers, blades, screens, and faceplates or other covers and devices should be selected or specified so as to minimize the likelihood of blockage by small debris and sediment. Where experience has shown that a particular device or type of device has been blocked or clogged by flood debris or sediment, use of such devices should be avoided." -ASCE 24-14 Pg. 45 (commentary)

===American Society of Civil Engineers definition===
The [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE) requirements apply to any structure that is not [[flood barrier#Local Flood Barriers|dry flood-proofed]] and which is in the [[flood insurance rate map|mapped]] flood zone. It calls for openings in [[load-bearing wall|load-bearing]] [[foundation wall]]s located below the mapped [[flood elevation]]. Where non-engineered openings are used, each opening must be at least three inches in diameter, and have no screen or other cover that interferes with the transition of water between interior and exterior. The total net open area of all flood openings in the structure must be equal to or greater than one square inch, per square foot of footprint of the enclosed area—though no fewer than two openings, total, which must be located on different walls. Openings must be placed such that the bottom of each opening is no more than one [[foot (unit)|foot]] above the adjacent ground level.&lt;ref name="ascesum"&gt;[http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=3515 Highlights of ASCE 24-05 Flood Resistant Design and Construction]&lt;/ref&gt;

In lieu of these requirements, engineered openings must conform to a performance standard: during a flood with a rate of rise/fall of five feet  per hour, the difference between interior and exterior flood water levels in an enclosure using the engineered openings must not be greater than one foot.&lt;ref name="codes" /&gt;

===International Building Code (IBC)===
The [[International Building Code]] refers to the American Society of Civil Engineer requirements for both non-engineered and engineered flood openings.

===International Residential Code (IRC)===
The [[International Residential Code]] requirements vary mildly from revision to revision, but require that entry and exit of floodwater be provided for in accordance with the requirements of the ASCE.&lt;ref name="icode03"&gt;2003 International Residential Code, International Code Council, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="icode06"&gt;2006 International Residential Code, International Code Council, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="icode09"&gt;2009 International Residential Code, International Code Council, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; These requirements apply for both non-engineered and engineered flood openings.

===FEMA===
While the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] does not have [[de jure]] authority over the building code, it maintains crucial influence over flood opening standards through its administration of the [[National Flood Insurance Program]] (NFIP). By controlling the standards for nearly all [[flood insurance]] in the United States, the NFIP exerts exceptional [[de facto]] authority over many aspects of floodplain construction. The FEMA (and, thus, NFIP) requirements for non-engineered openings are similar to requirements from the American Society of Civil Engineers. Unlike the ASCE, FEMA requires the placement of openings such that the bottom of each opening is no more than one foot above the higher of the adjacent ground level, or the interior foundation slab height.&lt;ref name="tb1"&gt;[http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=1579 FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-08: Openings in Foundation Walls and Walls of Enclosures]&lt;/ref&gt;

For engineered openings, FEMA offers two subclassifications: individual certification openings, and openings with [[International Code Council Evaluation Service]] (ICC-ES) Evaluation Reports. Individual certification openings are offered for use when, "[f]or architectural or other reasons, building designers or owners may prefer to use unique or individually designed openings or devices".&lt;ref name="tb1"/&gt; In such cases, an [[architect]] or [[engineer]] may provide certification including the professional's signature and applied [[seal (emblem)|seal]]. The certification must include a "statement certifying that the openings are designed to automatically equalize [[hydrostatic pressure|hydrostatic flood loads]] on exterior walls by allowing the automatic entry and exit of [[floodwater]]s in accordance with the...design requirements"; "[d]escription of the range of flood characteristics tested or computed for which the certification is valid, such as rates of rise and fall of floodwaters"; and "[d]escription of the installation requirements and limitations that, if not followed, will void the certification".&lt;ref name="tb1"/&gt; The nature of the "live seal" requirement means that each structure containing an individual certification opening must have a separate certification, even if the opening is identical to that used in another structure.

The alternative subclassification is an opening that carries certification through the ICC-ES. According to FEMA, "Evaluation Reports are issued only after the ICC-ES performs technical evaluations of documentation submitted by a manufacturer, including technical design reports, certifications, and testing that demonstrate code compliance and performance."&lt;ref name="tb1"/&gt; The report must include a statement concerning the purpose of the opening tested; a description of the characteristics tested; and a description of installation requirements. FEMA allows a copy of the report to be used as a blanket certification of any project including an ICC-ES certified opening, in contrast to the requirements of an individual certification opening.&lt;ref name="tb1"/&gt;

====AC364-1006-R1====
AC364-1006-R1 documents the ICC-ES's testing standards for flood openings, including specifications for a dual-chambered testing tank. While the requirements for the opening itself are based on ASCE 24, the substance of the test adds new layers of performance expectation. Under these requirements, the opening must activate before water level is one foot above the bottom of the opening, under conditions of 50 and 300 gallons per minute flooding, at a minimum of five foot per hour rate of rise. Additionally, water levels on the testing tank's "interior" and "exterior" portions must at no point differ more than one foot. To gauge performance against waterborne [[debris]], leaves and grass clippings are added to both chambers of the tank.&lt;ref name="ac364"&gt;[http://www.icc-es.org/Committee/0610-post/ac364.pdf AC364-1006-R1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Foreign Service Institute''' ('''FSI''') is the [[United States]] [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]'s primary training institution for employees of the U.S. foreign affairs community, preparing American diplomats as well as other professionals to advance U.S. foreign affairs interests overseas and in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zimmerman|first=Eilene|title=Hiring Window Is Open at the Foreign Service|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/jobs/21officers.html|work=[[New York Times]]|date=December 20, 2008|access-date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; FSI provides more than 800 courses—including over 70 foreign languages—to more than 170,000 enrollees a year from the [[Department of State]] and more than 50 other government agencies and the military service branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reiser|first=Mindy|title=Foreign Service Institute Prepares Government Workers for Global Careers|url=https://www.washdiplomat.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=15351:foreign-service-institute-prepares-government-workers-for-global-careers&amp;catid=1557&amp;Itemid=428|work=[[Washington Diplomat]]|date=May 5, 2017|access-date=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; FSI is based at the [[National Foreign Affairs Training Center]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]].

The Institute's programs include training for the development of [[United States Foreign Service]] and Civil Service professionals, and for Foreign Service Nationals who work at U.S. posts around the world. Ranging in length from one day to two years, courses are designed to promote successful performance in each professional assignment, to ease the adjustment to other countries and cultures, and to enhance the leadership and management capabilities of the U.S. foreign affairs community. Other courses and services help family members prepare for the demands of a mobile lifestyle and living abroad, and provide employees and their families with important information about such critical and timely topics as emergency preparedness and cyber-security awareness, among others.

According to the Foreign Service Institute’s website, the Foreign Service Institute is the U.S. government’s “premier foreign affairs training  provider...dedicated to ensuring the career-long learning opportunities required for success in today’s global arena.  FSI promotes substantive, regional, and linguistic expertise, leadership finesse, personal resilience and innovative problem-solving.  FSI serves the U.S. Department of State and the entire U.S. government foreign affairs community as a strategic enabler of diplomatic excellence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreign Service Institute|url=https://www.state.gov/m/fsi/|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|date=January 20, 2017|access-date=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Director of the Foreign Service Institute is equivalent in rank to an [[United States Assistant Secretary of State|Assistant Secretary of State]],&lt;ref name="FAM"&gt;{{cite web|title=1 FAM 290 Foreign Service Institute (FSI)|url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/01FAM/01FAM0290.html|work=[[Foreign Affairs Manual]]|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|date=September 8, 2014|access-date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is appointed by the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. The FSI Director is the Chief Learning Officer responsible for professional training for the U.S. Department of State and federal foreign affairs agencies.

== History ==
The Foreign Service Institute was first proposed as an in-service, graduate-level training institute for State Department employees and others in the Foreign Service. A number of different training schools and programs preceded the Foreign Service Institute, including the Consular School of Application (1907), the Wilson Diplomatic School (1909), the Foreign Service School (1924), the Foreign Service Officers' Training School (1931) and the Division of Training Services (1945).

In 1946, President Truman signed legislation that enabled Secretary of State George C. Marshall to establish the Institute on March 13, 1947. The Foreign Service Institute was initially authorized in Title VII of the [[Foreign Service Act]]. The issuance of Departmental orders fulfilling this section of the Act were delayed by the need to first resolve certain administrative issues. The orders were ultimately issued and, on March 13, 1947, Secretary of State [[George Marshall]] announced the establishment of the Foreign Service Institute.&lt;ref name="ADST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adst.org/2016/05/the-battle-to-create-the-foreign-service-institute/|title=The Battle to Create the Foreign Service Institute|access-date=March 24, 2017|publisher=[[Association of Diplomatic Studies and Training]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, the Foreign Service Institute opened in the Mayfair Building in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, D.C. at 2115 C Street NW, a building that was subsequently razed for the new [[Harry S Truman Building|State Department headquarters]].&lt;ref name="AllGov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreign Service Institute|url=http://www.allgov.com/departments/department-of-state/foreign-service-institute?agencyid=7180|publisher=AllGov.com|access-date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute included four schools: Basic Officer Training, Advanced Officer Training, Management and Administrative Training, and Language Training.&lt;ref name="ADST"/&gt; FSI then moved to leased space in Rosslyn, Virginia until October 1993, when it relocated to its current home. In 1954, the Wriston Report criticized the resources and support being devoted to FSI, and in the following year, FSI overhauled its curriculum, adding longer specialized training, putting a greater emphasis on language training, and opening up courses to wives of Foreign Service Officers.&lt;ref name="AllGov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='WRISTON REPORT' OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/cia-rdp78-04718a000100250049-2|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|access-date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1993, FSI moved to the [[National Foreign Affairs Training Center]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], and remains headquartered there today.&lt;ref name="AllGov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADST"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Foreign Affairs Training Center 2017 Master Plan Update|url=https://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/136234|publisher=[[General Services Administration]]|date=April 7, 2017|access-date=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, FSI celebrated the 70th anniversary of its founding, with the [[Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training]] releasing an e-book in honor of its anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=FSI at 70: Future Forward: A History of the Foreign Service Institute|last=Honley|first=Steven|publisher=Arlington Hall Press|date=March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Foreign Service Institute currently has four schools: Leadership and Management, Language Studies, Professional and Area Studies, and Applied Information Technology, along with the Transition Center and an executive office for administrative functions.&lt;ref name="FAM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OIG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inspection of the Foreign Service Institute|url=https://oig.state.gov/system/files/209366.pdf|publisher=[[Inspector General of the Department of State]]|date=March 2013|access-date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''School of Language Studies''' ('''SLS''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1 FAM 297 School of Language Studies (FSI/SLS)|url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/01FAM/01FAM0290.html|work=[[Foreign Affairs Manual]]|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|date=December 23, 2013|access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers instruction in more than 70 languages and proficiency testing in over 100 languages. Enrollments may be 8–44 weeks, depending on the difficulty of the language and the individual's proficiency objectives. The Foreign Service Institute's School of Language Studies also maintains a network of language field schools in Taipei, Yokohama, Seoul, and other regional programs in the Middle East, North Africa, and Asia where a further 44 weeks of instruction is offered overseas in [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Arabic]].&lt;ref name="FAM"/&gt; Programs and courses of study also include self-study, early morning classes and distance learning courses. FSI is a co-creator of the speaking and reading language proficiency rating scales used throughout the U.S. government.  SLS is active within the U.S. government’s interagency community of language trainers and testers and frequently benchmarks with external foreign affairs agencies on language instruction.

The''' School of Professional and Area Studies''' ('''SPAS''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1 FAM 294 School of Area and Professional Studies (FSI/SPAS)|url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/01FAM/01FAM0290.html|work=[[Foreign Affairs Manual]]|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|date=July 13, 2011|access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers training in foreign affairs specialties, such as consular, management tradecraft, political and economic affairs, public diplomacy, curriculum and staff development, office management, and orientation programs. It also offers guidance on the socio-cultural patterns, politics, economics, and international relations of world regions and individual countries. SPAS provides tailored programs in Consular, Economic and Commercial, Management, Office Management, Political, and Public Diplomacy, as well as new-hire orientation programs and in-depth Area Studies courses. SPAS is also home to the Center for the Study of the Conduct of Diplomacy (CSCD),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State Department Leaders Inaugurate New ‘Lessons Learned’ Center|url=http://www.govexec.com/management/2016/02/state-department-leaders-inaugurate-new-lessons-learned-center/125673/|date=February 3, 2016|access-date=March 30, 2017|last=Clark|first=Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; which examines recent diplomatic experiences in order to capture best practices and lessons learned.  CSCD produces comparative analyses which are incorporated into FSI training and used to help prepare foreign affairs professionals at all ranks for the challenges faced at U.S. missions around the world.

'''FCT''' refers to [[functional testing]]. Typically, the functional test is performed during the last phase of the production line.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.speedboard.co.uk/test-inspection/functional-test/&lt;/ref&gt; This is often referred to as a final [[quality control]] test, which is done to ensure that specifications are carried out by FCTs.

The process of FCTs is entailed by the emulation or simulation of the environment in which a product is expected to operate. This is done so to check, and correct any issues with functionality. The environment involved with FCTs consists of any device that communicates with an [[Device under test|DUT]], the power supply of said DUT, and any loads needed to make the DUT function correctly.

FCTs uses customer specific connectors, rather than [[test point|a test point]] on the PCB.

Functional tests are performed in an automatic fashion by production line operators using test software. In order for this to be completed, the software will communicate with any external programmable instruments such as I/O boards, [[Multimeter|digital multimeters]], and communication ports. In conjunction with the test fixture, the software that interfaces with the DUT is what makes it possible for a FCT to be performed.[http://www.circuittechassembly.com/te.php]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2105">'''Fuzzy electronics''' is an [[electronics|electronic]] technology that uses [[fuzzy logic]], instead of the two-state [[Boolean logic]] more commonly used in [[digital electronics]]. Fuzzy electronics is fuzzy logic implemented on dedicated hardware.  This is to be compared with fuzzy logic implemented in software running on a conventional processor. Fuzzy electronics has a wide range of applications, including [[control system]]s and [[artificial intelligence]].

==History==
The first fuzzy electronic circuit was built by Takeshi Yamakawa ''et al.'' in 1980 using discrete bipolar transistors.  The first industrial fuzzy application was in a cement kiln in Denmark in 1982.  The first [[VLSI]] fuzzy electronics was by Masaki Togai and Hiroyuki Watanabe in 1984.  In 1987, Yamakawa built the first analog fuzzy controller.  The first digital fuzzy processors came in 1988 by Togai (Russo, pp. 2-6).

'''Gary Russell Libby''' (born June 7, 1944) is an American art historian, author, educator and former museum director known for his books and scholarly exhibitions in the visual arts and his work on the history and development of the Florida School of Art.

== Early life and education ==

Libby was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], the second of three sons to Sylvia Phillips Libby of Boston and Charles Willard Libby of [[Machias, Maine]]. After graduation from [[Fort Myers Senior High School]], [[Ft. Myers, Florida]], he attended the [[University of Florida]] where he received an Associate of Arts, Bachelor and  Masters of Arts degrees in English Literature. Libby was awarded a post-graduate National Defense Education Act Fellowship to attend [[Tulane University]], [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], where he was accepted into the Doctoral Program with an interest in turn of the century art and literature journals published in England such as the Savoy and the Yellow Book. At Tulane, Libby worked with Dr. Jessie Poesch, Professor of  Art History at Sophie Newcomb College, Tulane University, and author of the landmark publication, ''The Arts of the Old South'', 1983. After graduation from Tulane with another Masters in English Literature and the completion of all coursework and examinations for the Ph.D. degree,&lt;ref&gt;See Tulane University of Louisiana, Record , Gary R. Libby, p 426-476 The Graduate School. March 15, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Libby was hired as an Assistant Professor by [[Stetson University]] in 1972.

== Career ==
[[File:Gary Russell Libby at dedication of the Gary R. Libby Gallery located in the UF School of Art and Art History.jpg|thumb|Gary Russell Libby in the Gary R. Libby Gallery]]At [[Stetson University]], [[DeLand, Florida]], Libby developed the curriculum for a number of upper division interdisciplinary courses for a new major in the arts and humanities. He also worked with Fred Messersmith  AWS, chairman of the Department of Art, in developing a series of exhibitions that explored the careers of artists from the United States and abroad who painted in [[Florida]] from post-Civil War to [[World War I]].  While at Stetson, Libby published a number of articles in academic journals including the Italian Quarterly and Paideuma.

He also began his study of Cuban historic artists in the Fulgencio Batista Collection of Cuban art housed at the Cuban Foundation Museum, [[Museum of Arts and Sciences (Daytona Beach)|Museum of Arts and Sciences]], [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]. Libby’s “Artistic Taste in Pre-Castro Cuba “ was one of the lead papers presented  at the Southeastern Museum Conference, Charleston, South Carolina, 1975. That paper became the foundation of two books Libby authored. (''Two Centuries of Cuban Art: 1759-1959'', a soft cover bi-lingual catalog, published by the Ringling Museum of Art, with essays interpreting works of art from the Batista Collection exhibition, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;See Archives John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, Two Centuries of Cuban Art: 1759-1959. 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Libby curated the exhibition at the [[John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art]], [[Sarasota]], [[Florida]], with additional works from the [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[New York City|New York]]; [[The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], [[New York City|New York]], and the Museum of Modern Art of Latin America, [[Washington, DC]]. ''Cuba-A History in Art'', University Press of Florida, 1997, revised edition 2015.)

At [[Stetson University]], Libby served as Secretary of the Faculty Senate and acting University Art Archivist. In 1975, he was elected as a Trustee at the Museum of Arts and Sciences, [[Daytona Beach]], [[Florida]], and became a Charter Member of the International Society of Fine Art Appraisers, Ltd.

In 1977, Libby was hired as the Executive Director of the Museum of Arts and Sciences which became accredited by the [[American Alliance of Museums]] and a Smithsonian Affiliate under Libby’s leadership. The Museum grew from one location of 7,000 sq. ft. to 120,000 sq. ft. with three different locations. Libby was also selected for and completed one of the first classes of the Smithsonian Institution’s Museum Leadership and Management Certification Program directed by Jane Glaser. At the Museum, Libby organized and led the first international museum travel program in [[Florida]]. This annual program introduced cultural treasures in [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], [[South America]], [[Europe]], [[Scandinavia]], North and Equatorial [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]], [[Asia]] and [[Australia]] to thousands of central Floridians who attended these interpreted educational and cultural expeditions.  At his 2002 retirement, the Trustees of the Museum of Arts and Sciences named Libby as the first Director Emeritus and named the Lobby of the Museum as the “Gary R. Libby Entry Court.” A Trustee-led community-wide effort also raised nearly one million dollars to endow the Gary R. Libby Curator of Art position at the Museum of Arts and Sciences.

Libby continues to teach and lecture at Stetson University as a Visiting Professor /Guest Curator and also guest lectures for the Honors College at the [[University of Florida]] as Adjunct Lecturer.

== Personal life and public service ==

Gary R. Libby lives in a restored National Register Colonial Revival House built in 1925 in [[Daytona Beach]]. He is active in a number of area heritage, arts and cultural organizations and was selected as a Daytona Beach Hometown Hero in 2016.

Libby is past secretary of the Florida Association of Museums and received their Lifetime Achievement Award in 1998. He is a two-time past president of the Florida Art Museum Directors Association who presented him with their Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000. Also in 2000, he was awarded the National Community Service Award by the National Junior Leagues of America. Libby was appointed to the Florida Arts Council through a gubernatorial appointment, 2005-2007. He served as a Trustee at [[Stetson University]], 2008-2011. In 2012, he was elected to the University of Florida Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;See Archives, University of Florida Foundation, Inc. Office of the Vice President, Appointment letter February 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Libby was elected to the Board of Visitors at the Cornell Fine Art Museum at [[Rollins College]], [[Winter Park, Florida]], 2014, and chaired the Exhibitions Committee. In 2014, he was selected as the citywide Mayoral representative to the Daytona Beach Charter Review Commission. He also was elected to the City of Daytona Beach Board of Adjustments in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;For all City of Daytona Beach, Florida related items see City Clerk, City of Daytona Beach, Florida, Record of Appointments , Gary R. Libby.&lt;/ref&gt;

Libby serves or has served on a number of [[Daytona Beach]], [[Volusia County]], State of [[Florida]] and National Advisory Boards including the [[Institute of Museum and Library Services]] (Libby served as a National Reviewer for their Grants Program) and the [[American Alliance of Museums]], (he served as a Visiting on-site Accreditor for mid-size and large museums seeking accreditation from the AAM.) Both organizations are located in [[Washington, DC]]. Libby was the creator and moderator of a one-hour cultural information program, Culture Comes Alive, on radio AM 1380, streaming internationally on the web  from 2013-2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4675">In [[astronomy]], the '''geometric albedo''' of a [[celestial body]] is the ratio of its actual brightness as seen from the light source (i.e. at zero [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]]) to that of an ''idealized'' flat, fully reflecting, [[diffuse reflection|diffusively scattering]] ([[Lambertian reflectance|Lambertian]]) disk with the same cross-section. (This phase angle refers to the direction of the light paths and is not a phase angle in its normal meaning in [[Phase (waves)|optics]] or [[Phasor (electronics)|electronics]].)

[[Diffuse reflection|Diffuse scattering]] implies that radiation is reflected isotropically with no memory of the location of the incident light source. Zero phase angle corresponds to looking along the direction of illumination. For Earth-bound observers this occurs when the body in question is at [[opposition (astronomy)|opposition]] and on the [[ecliptic]].

The '''visual geometric albedo''' refers to the geometric albedo quantity when accounting for only [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the [[visible spectrum]].

== Airless bodies ==

The surface materials ([[regolith]]s) of airless bodies (in fact, the majority of bodies in the [[Solar System]]) are strongly non-Lambertian and exhibit the [[opposition effect]], which is a strong tendency to reflect light straight back to its source, rather than scattering light diffusely.

The geometric albedo of these bodies can be difficult to determine because of this, as their [[Bidirectional reflectance distribution function|reflectance]] is strongly peaked for a small range of phase angles near zero.&lt;ref name=medkeff&gt;See for example [http://jeff.medkeff.com/astro/lunar/obs_tech/albedo.htm this discussion of Lunar albedo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413042346/http://jeff.medkeff.com/astro/lunar/obs_tech/albedo.htm |date=April 13, 2009 }} by Jeff Medkeff.&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of this peak differs markedly between bodies, and can only be found by making measurements at small enough phase angles. Such measurements are usually difficult due to the necessary precise placement of the observer very close to the incident light. For example, the Moon is never seen from the Earth at exactly zero phase angle, because then it is being eclipsed. Other Solar System bodies are not in general seen at exactly zero phase angle even at [[opposition (astronomy)|opposition]], unless they are also simultaneously located at the [[Ascending node#Node distinction|ascending or descending node]] of their orbit, and hence lie on the [[ecliptic]]. In practice, measurements at small nonzero phase angles are used to derive the parameters which characterize the directional reflectance properties for the body ([[Hapke parameters]]). The reflectance function described by these can then be extrapolated to zero phase angle to obtain an estimate of the geometric albedo.

For very bright, solid, airless objects such as [[Saturn]]'s moons [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] and [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]], whose total reflectance ([[Bond albedo]]) is close to one, a strong [[opposition effect]] combines with the high Bond albedo to give them a geometric albedo above unity (1.4 in the case of Enceladus). Light is preferentially reflected straight back to its source even at low [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] such as on the limb or from a slope, whereas a Lambertian surface would scatter the radiation much more broadly. A geometric albedo above unity means that the intensity of light scattered back per unit solid angle towards the source is higher than is possible for any Lambertian surface.

== Equivalent definitions ==

For the hypothetical case of a plane surface, the geometric albedo is the [[albedo]] of the surface when the illumination is provided by a beam of radiation that comes in [[perpendicular]] to the surface.

== Examples ==

The geometric albedo may be greater or smaller than the Bond albedo, depending on surface and atmospheric properties of the body in question. Some examples:&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/phyopt/albedo.html Albedo of the Earth&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The collection is named for the [[David Green (entrepreneur)|Green family]], founders and leaders of [[Hobby Lobby]], the world’s largest privately owned arts and crafts retailer. The collection was assembled beginning in November 2009 by its original director, ancient/medieval manuscript specialist Scott Carroll, in cooperation with Steve Green, president of [[Hobby Lobby]] and the collection's benefactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fabrikant|first=Geraldine|title=Craft Shop Family Buys Up Ancient Bibles for Museum|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/12/business/12bibles.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=8 April 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bible Collection Goes on Tour|url=http://video.foxnews.com/v/1118899846001/bible-collection-goes-on-tour|accessdate=19 December 2011|station=Fox News|date=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Highlights==
[[Image:Codex Climaci Rescriptus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Codex Climaci Rescriptus]]]]

The capstone of The Green Collection is the [[Codex Climaci Rescriptus]], known as Uncial 0250 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering); which is a [[palimpsest]] whose underwriting includes pages from a Greek uncial manuscript of the New Testament, as well as pages from a Christian Palestinian Aramaic uncial manuscript of the Old and New Testament. Paleographically the Greek section has been assigned to the 8th century (or 7th century), and the Christian Palestinian Aramaic section to the 6th century.

===Provenance===
In 2015 questions were raised about the provenance of some articles in the collection when ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' ran a story about two or three hundred [[cuneiform]] tablets purchased form an Israeli antiquities dealer and confiscated by U.S. Customs when they were being shipped to the Green collection storage facility in Oklahoma City in 2011.  As of 2015, the tablets remained impounded as a legal dispute regarding the possible illegal purchase of antiquities removed from a conflict zone (Mesopotamia) proceeds.&lt;ref name=Vikan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vikan|first1=Gary|title=Probe of Steve Green’s antiquities may be inevitable; his response is not|url=http://www.religionnews.com/2015/10/30/probe-steve-greens-antiquities-may-inevitable-response-not-commentary/|accessdate=9 November 2015|publisher=[[Religion News Service]]|date=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum of the Bible==
{{main|Museum of the Bible}}
In 2012, Steve Green announced his family's intention to open a permanent institution, which he claimed would be a scholarly museum, not an [[Evangelism|evangelistic]] outreach ministry, within the next four years to house The Green Collection. The [[mission statement]] of the museum, however, as found in its [[501(c) organization|501(c)3]] tax filings for 2011, the most recent year available, is "To bring to life the living Word of God, to tell its compelling story of preservation, and to inspire confidence in the absolute authority and reliability of the Bible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Caplan-Bricker|first=Nora|title=The Hobby Lobby President Is Also Building a Bible Museum for Over $70 Million|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/117145/museum-bible-hobby-lobby-founders-other-religious-project|accessdate=2 March 2015|newspaper=The New Republic|date=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Green told a press conference that the Museum will focus on  the Bible’s impact, history and narrative, explaining that while he might hope that the museum would bring people to Christianity, the museum is not created as a tool of evangelizing, “We’re not discussing a lot of particulars of the book. It’s more of a high-level discussion of here’s this book, what is its history and impact and what is its story."&lt;ref name="O'Connell"/&gt;

The Greens identified [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], and [[New York City]] as finalists for the museum's location.&lt;ref name=WaPo&gt;{{cite news|last=Banks|first=Adelle M.|title=Bible museum planned for Washington, D.C.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/bible-museum-planned-for-washington-dc/2012/07/10/gJQAWH2MbW_story.html|accessdate=24 September 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, The Green Collection announced the purchase of the building housing the Washington Design Center in D.C., for a reported $50 million, to house the as-yet-unnamed national Bible museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Banks|first=Adelle M.|title=Washington D.C.: Bible Museum Closes $50 Million Deal For Spot Near National Mall|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/28/washington-dc-bible-museum_n_1712549.html|accessdate=3 October 2012|newspaper=Religion News Service|date=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sernovitz|first=Daniel|title=Museum makes a divine acquisition|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/print-edition/2012/07/20/museum-makes-a-divine-acquisition.html?page=all|accessdate=3 October 2012|newspaper=Washington Business Journal|date=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Washingtonian&gt;{{cite news|last=Joynt|first=Carol Ross|title=The Museum of the Bible to Replace the Washington Design Center|url=http://www.washingtonian.com/blogs/capitalcomment/local-news/the-museum-of-the-bible-to-replace-the-washington-design-center.php|accessdate=24 September 2012|newspaper=Washingtonian|date=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Beermann|first=Judith|title=Divine Decor to Divine Inspiration: WDC Becomes Bible Museum|url=http://www.thegeorgetowndish.com/thedish/divine-decor-divine-inspiration-wdc-becomes-bible-museum|accessdate=3 October 2012|newspaper=The Georgetown Dish|date=July 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building is located two blocks from the [[National Mall]] at 300 D. Street SW, near the [[Federal Center SW]] [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority|Metro]] station. The museum will reportedly charge admission, as do other private museums in Washington, such as the [[National Building Museum]], the [[International Spy Museum]], and the [[Newseum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McKay|first=Dominique|title=D.C.

[[File:Flora OR - aerial.jpg|thumb|right|The small town of [[Flora, Oregon]] in the United States is unincorporated, but is considered a populated place.]]
[[File:Taos Pueblo2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.13|[[Taos Pueblo]], an ancient [[pueblo]] belonging to a [[Taos language|Taos]]-speaking [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe of [[Pueblo people]]. It is approximately 1000 years old and lies about 1 mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) north of the modern city of [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]], [[New Mexico]].]]
In [[geography]], [[statistics]] and [[archaeology]], a '''settlement''', '''locality''' or '''populated place''' is a [[community]] in which people live. The complexity of a settlement can range from a small number of dwellings grouped together to the largest of cities with surrounding [[Urban area|urbanized areas]]. Settlements may include [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s, [[village]]s, [[town]]s and [[city|cities]].  A settlement may have known historical properties such as the date or era in which it was first settled, or first settled by  particular people.

In the field of [[geospatial predictive modeling]], settlements are "a city, town, village or other agglomeration of buildings where people live and work".&lt;ref name=Semantics&gt;{{cite book |title= GeoSpatial Semantics: 4th International Conference, GeoS 2011, Brest, France |url= http://eprints.biblio.unitn.it/archive/00001928/01/062.pdf |chapter= A Facet-Based Methodology for Geo-Spatial Modeling |last= Dutta |first= Biswanath |author2=Fausto Giunchiglia |author3=Vincenzo Maltese |year= 2010 |page= 143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A settlement conventionally includes its constructed facilities such as [[road]]s, [[enclosure]]s, [[field systems]], [[Boundaries in landscape history|boundary]] banks and [[ditch]]es, [[pond]]s, [[park]]s and [[wood]]s, [[windmill|wind]] and [[water mill]]s, [[manor house]]s, [[moat]]s and [[church (building)|church]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britarch.ac.uk/msrg/msrgpolicy.htm  Medieval Settlement Research Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest remains that have been found of constructed dwellings are remains of huts that were made of mud and branches around 17,000&amp;nbsp;BC at the [[Ohalo]] site (now underwater) near the edge of the [[Sea of Galilee]]. The [[Natufian]]s built houses, also in the [[Levant]], around 10,000&amp;nbsp;BC. Remains of settlements such as [[village]]s become much more common after the invention of agriculture.

== In landscape history ==
[[File:Eoste Keldrimägi.JPG|thumb|Some settlement sites may go out of use. This location in [[Estonia]] was used for human settlement in 2nd half of first millennium and it is considered an [[archaeological record]], that may provide information on how people lived back then.]]
[[Landscape history]] studies the form (morphology) of settlements – for example whether they are [[dispersed settlement|dispersed]] or [[nucleated village|nucleated]]. [[Urban morphology]] can thus be considered a special type of cultural-historical landscape studies. Settlements can be ordered by size, centrality or other factors to define a [[settlement hierarchy]].

== Statistics ==

=== Australia ===
[[Geoscience Australia]] defines a populated place as "a named settlement with a population of 200 or more persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ga.gov.au/mapspecs/250k100k/appendixA_files/Habitation.jsp#Habitation%20Populated%20Place%20Point |title= NTMS Specifications (250K &amp; 100K): Populated place |publisher= [[Australian Government]] |accessdate= July 26, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110603115645/http://www.ga.gov.au/mapspecs/250k100k/appendixA_files/Habitation.jsp#Habitation%20Populated%20Place%20Point |archive-date= June 3, 2011 |dead-url= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Committee for Geographical Names in Australasia]] used the term [[Suburbs and localities (Australia)|localities]] for rural areas, while the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] uses the term "urban centres/localities" for urban areas.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
The [[Agency for Statistics in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] uses the term "populated place" for rural, and "municipality" and  "town" for urban areas.

=== Bulgaria ===
The Bulgarian Government publishes a National Register of Populated places (NRPP).

=== Canada ===
The Canadian government uses the term "populated place" in the ''[[Atlas of Canada]]'', but does not define it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/learningresources/glossary/results.html?term= |title=Glossary Search Results |work=[[Atlas of Canada]] |publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]] |accessdate=July 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006185826/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/learningresources/glossary/results.html?term= |archivedate=October 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Statistics Canada]] uses the term [[Census geographic units of Canada#Localities|localities]] for historical named locations.

=== Croatia ===
The [[Croatian Bureau of Statistics]] records population in units called [[settlement (Croatia)|settlements (''naselja'')]].

=== India ===
The Census Commission of [[India]] has a special definition of [[census town]]s.

=== Ireland ===
The  [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]] of the [[Republic of Ireland]] has a special definition of [[census town]]s.

=== Russia ===
There are various [[types of inhabited localities in Russia]].

=== Sweden ===
[[Statistics Sweden]] uses the term [[Urban areas in Sweden|localities (''tätort'')]] for various densely populated places. The common English-language translation is ''urban areas''.

=== United Kingdom ===
The UK [[Department for Communities and Local Government]] uses the term "urban settlement" to denote an [[urban area]] when analysing census information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/urbansettlement2001 Urban Settlement 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Registrar General for Scotland]] defines settlements as groups of one or more contiguous localities, which are determined according to [[population density]] and [[postcode]] areas. The Scottish settlements are used as one of several factors defining urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files1/the-census/key-stats-setloc-txt.pdf Scottish census information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218162030/http://gro-scotland.gov.uk/files1/the-census/key-stats-setloc-txt.pdf |date=2010-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
The [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) has a [[Geographic Names Information System]] that defines three classes of human settlement:
# '''Populated place''' − [[Location (geography)|place]] or [[Area (country subdivision)|area]] with clustered or scattered [[building]]s and a permanent human [[population]] (city, settlement, town, village).  A populated place is usually not [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] and by definition has no legal boundaries. However, a populated place may have a corresponding "civil" record, the legal boundaries of which may or may not coincide with the perceived populated place.&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web |url= http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:8:3692675055014428 |title= Feature Class Definitions |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate= July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Census''' − a statistical area delineated locally specifically for the tabulation of Census Bureau data (census designated place, census county division, unorganized territory, various types of American Indian/Alaska Native statistical areas).&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;
# '''Civil''' − a political division formed for administrative purposes ([[borough]], [[county]], [[Place (United States Census Bureau)|incorporated place]], [[municipio]], [[List of parishes in Louisiana|parish]], [[town]], [[township]])."&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;

Populated places may be specifically defined in the context of [[census]]es and be different from general-purpose administrative entities, such as [[Place (United States Census Bureau)|"place" as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau]] or [[census-designated place]]s.

== Geospatial modeling ==
In the field of [[geospatial predictive modeling]], settlements are "a city, town, village, or other agglomeration of buildings where people live and work".&lt;ref name=Semantics&gt;{{cite book |title= GeoSpatial Semantics: 4th International Conference, GeoS 2011, Brest, France |url= http://eprints.biblio.unitn.it/archive/00001928/01/062.pdf |chapter= A Facet-Based Methodology for Geo-Spatial Modeling |last= Dutta |first= Biswanath |author2=Fausto Giunchiglia |author3=Vincenzo Maltese |year= 2010 |page= 143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Human Settlement Layer ([http://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ GHSL]) framework produces global spatial information about the human presence on the planet over time. This in the form of built up maps, population density maps and settlement maps. This information is generated with evidence-based analytics and knowledge using new spatial data mining technologies. The framework uses heterogeneous data including global archives of fine-scale satellite imagery, census data, and volunteered geographic information. The data is processed fully automatically and generates analytics and knowledge reporting objectively and systematically about the presence of population and built-up infrastructures. The [http://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ GHSL] operates in an open and free data and methods access policy (open input, open method, open output).

== Abandoned populated places ==

The term "Abandoned populated places" is a ''Feature Designation Name'' in databases sourced by the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]&lt;ref name="NGA Geonames"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geonames.nga.mil/ggmagaz/feadesgsearchhtml.asp |title=Feature Designation Code Lookup |work=NGA: Geonames Search – OGC Viewer |publisher=[[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] |location=Springfield, VA, USA |accessdate=February 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102121347/http://geonames.nga.mil/ggmagaz/feadesgsearchhtml.asp |archivedate=January 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[GeoNames]].&lt;ref name="GeoNames"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geonames.org/export/codes.html#P.PPLQ |title=GeoNames Feature Codes |date=February 10, 2012 |work=GeoNames |publisher=[[GeoNames]]|accessdate=February 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Populated places can be abandoned.  Sometimes the structures are still easily accessible, such as in a [[ghost town]], and these may become tourist attractions. Some places that have the appearance of a ghost town, however, may still be defined as populated places by government entities.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

A town may become a ghost town because the economic activity that supported it has failed, because of a government action, such as the building of a dam that floods the town, or because of natural or human-caused disasters such as floods, uncontrolled lawlessness, or war. The term is sometimes used to refer to cities, towns, and neighborhoods that are still populated, but significantly less so than in years past.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

[[File:Immunofluorescence.jpg|thumb|These figures demonstrates the basic mechanism of immunofluorescence. Primary immunofluorescence is depicted on the left, which shows an antibody with a fluorophore group bound to it directly binding to the epitope of the antigen for which it is specific. Once the antibody binds to the epitope, the sample can be viewed under fluorescent microscope to confirm the presence of the antigen in the sample. Conversely, secondary immunofluorescence is depicted to the right, which shows that first an untagged primary antibody binds to the epitope of the antigen in a mechanism similar to the one described above. However, after the primary antibodies have bound to their target, a secondary antibody (tagged with a fluorophore) comes along. This secondary antibody’s binding sites are specific for the primary antibody that’s already bound to the antigen, and therefore the secondary antibody binds to the primary antibody. This method allows for more fluorophore-tagged antibodies to attach to their target, thus increasing the fluorescent signal during microscopy.]]
'''Immunofluorescence''' is a technique used for [[optical microscope|light]] [[microscopy]] with a [[fluorescence microscope]] and is used primarily on [[microbiological]] samples. This technique uses the specificity of [[antibodies]] to their [[antigen]] to target [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] [[dyes]] to specific [[biomolecule]] targets within a cell, and therefore allows visualization of the distribution of the target molecule through the sample. The specific region an antibody recognizes on an antigen is called an epitope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mandrell|first=R. E.|last2=Griffiss|first2=J. M.|last3=Macher|first3=B.

Immunofluorescence can be used on tissue sections, cultured [[cell lines]], or individual cells, and may be used to analyze the distribution of [[protein]]s, [[glycan]]s, and small biological and non-biological molecules. This technique can even be used to visualize structures such as intermediate-sized filaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Franke|first=W.

=== Preparation of fluorescence ===
To make fluorochrome-labeled antibodies, a fluorochrome must be conjugated ("tagged") to the antibody. Likewise, an antigen can also be conjugated to the antibody with a fluorescent probe in a technique called fluorescent antigen technique. Staining procedures can apply to both fixed antigen in the cytoplasm or to cell surface antigens on live cells, called "membrane immunofluorescence". It is also possible to label the complement of the antibody-antigen complex with a fluorescent probe.  In addition to the element to which fluorescence probes are attached, there are two general classes of immunofluorescence techniques: primary and secondary. The following descriptions will focus primarily on these classes in terms of conjugated antibodies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are two classes of immunofluorescence techniques, primary (or direct) and secondary (or indirect).

===Primary (direct)===
Primary (direct) immunofluorescence uses a single, primary antibody, chemically linked to a [[fluorophore]]. The primary antibody recognizes the target molecule (antigen) and binds to a specific region called the epitope. The attached fluorophore can be detected via fluorescent microscopy, which, depending on the messenger used, will emit a specific wavelength of light once excited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.dako.com/08002_03aug09_ihc_guidebook_5th_edition_chapter_10.pdf | chapter = Immunohistochemical Staining Methods | title = IHC Guidebook | edition = Sixth | date = 2013 | publisher = Dako Denmark A/S, An Agilent Technologies Company }}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct immunofluorescence, although somewhat less common, has notable advantages over the secondary (indirect) procedure. The direct attachment of the messenger to the antibody reduces the number of steps in the procedure, saving time and reducing non-specific background signal.&lt;ref name=Frit&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fritschy | first1 = Jean-Marc | last2 = Härtig | first2 = Wolfgang | name-list-format = vanc | title = Immunofluorescence | doi = 10.1038/npg.els.0001174 | url = http://www.els.net/WileyCDA/ElsArticle/refId-a0001174.html | year = 2001 | journal = ELS | isbn = 978-0-470-01590-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This also limits the possibility of antibody cross-reactivity and possible mistakes throughout the process.

However, some disadvantages do exist in this method. Since the number of fluorescent molecules that can be bound to the primary antibody is limited, direct immunofluorescence is substantially less sensitive than indirect immunofluorescence and may result in false negatives. Direct immunofluorescence also requires the use of much more primary antibody, which is extremely expensive, sometimes running up to $400.00/mL.

===Secondary (indirect)===
[[File:Blood vessels in porcine skin - SMA A488 - 20x.jpg|thumb|right|A fluorescent stain for [[actin]] in the [[smooth muscle]] of the skin.]]
Secondary (indirect) immunofluorescence uses two antibodies; the unlabeled first  (primary) antibody specifically binds the target molecule, and the secondary antibody, which carries the fluorophore, recognizes the primary antibody and binds to it.  Multiple secondary antibodies can bind a single primary antibody.  This provides signal amplification by increasing the number of fluorophore molecules per antigen.&lt;ref name=Frit/&gt; This protocol is more complex and time-consuming than the primary (or direct) protocol above, but allows more flexibility because a variety of different secondary antibodies and detection techniques can be used for a given primary antibody.&lt;ref name=Frit/&gt;

This protocol is possible because an antibody consists of two parts, a variable region (which recognizes the antigen) and constant region (which makes up the structure of the antibody molecule). It is important to realize that this division is artificial and in reality the antibody molecule is four polypeptide chains: two heavy chains and two light chains. A researcher can generate several primary antibodies that recognize various antigens (have different variable regions), but all share the same constant region. All these antibodies may therefore be recognized by a single secondary antibody. This saves the cost of modifying the primary antibodies to directly carry a fluorophore.

Different primary antibodies with different constant regions are typically generated by raising the antibody in different species. For example, a researcher might create primary antibodies in a goat that recognize several antigens, and then employ dye-coupled rabbit secondary antibodies that recognize the goat antibody constant region ("rabbit anti-goat" antibodies). The researcher may then create a second set of primary antibodies in a mouse that could be recognized by a separate "donkey anti-mouse" secondary antibody. This allows re-use of the difficult-to-make dye-coupled antibodies in multiple experiments.

==Limitations==
As with most fluorescence techniques, a significant problem with immunofluorescence is [[photobleaching]].  Loss of activity caused by photobleaching can be controlled by reducing or limiting the intensity or time-span of light exposure, by increasing the concentration of fluorophores, or by employing more robust fluorophores that are less prone to bleaching (e.g., [[Alexa Fluor]]s, Seta Fluors, or [[DyLight Fluor]]s). Some problems that may arise from this technique include autofluorescence, extraneous undesired specific fluorescence, and nonspecific fluorescence. Autofluorescence includes fluorescence emitted from the sample tissue or cell itself. Extraneous undesired specific fluorescence occurs when a targeted antigen is impure and contains antigenic contaminants. Nonspecific fluorescence involves the loss of a probe's specificity due to fluorophore, from improper fixation, or from a dried out specimen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Immunofluorescence is only limited to fixed (i.e., dead) cells when structures within the cell are to be visualized because antibodies do not penetrate the cell membrane when reacting with fluorescent labels. Antigenic material must be fixed firmly on the site of its natural localization inside the cell.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/643714056|title=Immunofluorescence in medical science : with 28 tab.|last=Akiyoshi.|first=Kawamura,|date=1983-01-01|publisher=Springer u.a|isbn=3540124837|oclc=643714056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intact antibodies can also be too large to dye cancer cells ''in vivo''.&lt;ref name="Sonn_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sonn GA, Behesnilian AS, Jiang ZK, Zettlitz KA, Lepin EJ, Bentolila LA, Knowles SM, Lawrence D, Wu AM, Reiter RE | title = Fluorescent Image-Guided Surgery with an Anti-Prostate Stem Cell Antigen (PSCA) Diabody Enables Targeted Resection of Mouse Prostate Cancer Xenografts in Real Time | journal = Clinical Cancer Research  | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 1403–12 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26490315 | doi = 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-15-0503 | pmc=4794340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their size results in slow tumor penetration and long circulating half-life. Research has been done investigating the use of diabodies to get around this limitation.&lt;ref name="Sonn_2016" /&gt; Proteins in the supernatant or on the outside of the cell membrane can be bound by the antibodies; this allows for living cells to be stained. Depending on the fixative that is being used, proteins of interest might become cross-linked and this could result in either false positive or false negative signals due to non-specific binding.

An alternative approach is using [[recombinant protein]]s containing fluorescent protein domains, e.g., [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP). Use of such "tagged" proteins allows determination of their localization in live cells. Even though this seems to be an elegant alternative to immunofluorescence, the cells have to be transfected or transduced with the GFP-tag, and as a consequence they become at least S1 or above organisms that require stricter security standards in a laboratory. This technique involves altering the genetic information of cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chalfie|first=Martin|date=1995-10-01|title=Green Fluorescent Protein|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-1097.1995.tb08712.x/abstract|journal=Photochemistry and Photobiology|language=en|volume=62|issue=4|pages=651–656|doi=10.1111/j.1751-1097.1995.tb08712.x|issn=1751-1097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advances ==
Many improvements to this method lie in the improvement of fluorescent microscopes and fluorophores. Super-resolution methods generally refer to a microscope's ability to produce resolution below the Abbe limit (a limit placed on light due to its wavelength). This diffraction limit is about 200-300&amp;nbsp;nm in the lateral direction and 500-700&amp;nbsp;nm in the axial direction. This limit is comparable or larger than some structures in the cell, and consequently, this limit prevented scientists from determining details in their structure.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.biochem.77.061906.092014|title=Super-Resolution Fluorescence Microscopy|last=Huang|first=Bo|last2=Bates|first2=Mark|date=2009-06-02|website=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.biochem.77.061906.092014|language=en|doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.77.061906.092014|pmc=2835776|pmid=19489737|access-date=2017-03-24|last3=Zhuang|first3=Xiaowei}}&lt;/ref&gt; Super-resolution in fluorescence, more specifically, refers to the ability of a microscope to prevent the simultaneous fluorescence of adjacent spectrally identical fluorophores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/960719686|title=Super-resolution imaging in biomedicine|last=1959-|first=Diaspro, Alberto,|last2=van,|first2=Zandvoort, Marc A.

'''Inflatable space structures''' are structures which use pressurized air to maintain shape and rigidity. Notable examples of terrestrial inflatable structures include [[inflatable boat]]s, and some military [[tent]]s.{{cn|date=December 2011}} 
Inflatable structures are also candidates for [[Inflatable space habitat|space structures]], given their low weight, and hence easy transportability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1339">'''Internet Protocol Device Control''' ('''IPDC''') is a 1998 specification of a [[communications protocol]] for [[voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) telephony, developed by [[Level 3 Communications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ejub Kajan|title=Information Technology Encyclopedia and Acronyms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XQOrCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA646|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-56262-4|pages=646}}, p.267&lt;/ref&gt;

IPDC divides the operation of telephony gateways between intelligent call routers in an [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) network and simple [[media gateway]]s at the edge of the IP network and the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN).

Internet Protocol Device Control was fused with the [[Simple Gateway Control Protocol]] (SGCP), a project independently in progress at [[Bellcore]], to form the [[Media Gateway Control Protocol]] (MGCP). This group of protocols employs the [[media gateway control protocol architecture]] that is also the foundation of [[H.248|MEGACO/H.248]], a similar protocol which became a standards-track protocol at the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF).

The '''''Iron Science Teacher''''' is a national competition that celebrates innovation and creativity in science teaching. The competition originated at the [[Exploratorium]] in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=calgary&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Science Teacher 2011|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/news/utoday/march15-2011/iron_science|accessdate=10-2-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parodying the cult Japanese TV program, “[[Iron Chef]],” this competition showcases science teachers as they devise classroom activities using a particular ingredient — an everyday item such as a plastic bag, milk carton, or nail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Science Teacher: At the Explo and Live Webcast|url=http://press.exploratorium.edu/iron-science-teacher-live-webcast-june-2011/|accessdate=10-2-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Contestants are currently or formally part of the Exploratorium's Teacher Institute and compete before a live audience for the title of "Iron Science Teacher."  Shows are also archived on the [http://www.exploratorium.edu/tv/index.php?project=11 Exploratorium's site].

Astrophysicist Dr. Linda Shore, Director of the Exploratorium Teacher Institute and host of the competition, says one goal of the Iron Science Teacher is to "provide teachers with ideas about how to teach multimillion dollar state and national science teaching standards using, trash, recyclables, and inexpensive materials" as well as "to allow teachers to receive applause for great teaching."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Science Teacher|url=http://www.exo.net/~pauld/iron_science_teacher/ironsciencensta2003.html|publisher=Exploratorium|accessdate=10-2-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Back in 1997, the Exploratorium's Phyllis C. Wattis Webcast Studio was looking for new shows. During a staff brainstorming session, a fan of the popular Food Network television show, [[The Iron Chef]], suggested naming a secret ingredient for science teachers to use in an experiment to present to the audience. "It was honestly and truly a joke," Shore says. "We thought we'd do one show."&lt;ref name=da&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Science Teacher|url=http://www.districtadministration.com/article/iron-science-teacher|publisher=District Administration|accessdate=10-2-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Shows==
Now 10 to 12 shows are produced annually for the Exploratorium's website. "Secret" ingredients, which are revealed in advance to participants so they can practice, have included everything from ordinary baking soda and food coloring to Marshmallow Peeps and pantyhose.&lt;ref name=da /&gt;

==Spin-offs==
The Canadian Iron Science Teacher also parodies the popular TV series Iron Chef and is hosted by Jay Ingram of Daily Planet on Discovery Channel.&lt;ref name=calgary /&gt;   Unlike the Exploratorium version, where championship comes with no tangible prize, in the Canadian version, five "finalist" teachers, with their support teams, are selected to compete in the Iron Science Teacher finals at the University of Calgary in order to win a variety of cash prizes.  

Colorado Springs, CO initiated their own CoOL Iron Science Teacher Competition as part of their What If: A Festival of Creativity &amp; Innovation on September 11, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colorado Springs CoOL Iron Science Teacher|url=http://www.coolscience.org/CoolScience/Teachers/CSCSF2010-IronScience.htm|publisher=Cool Science|accessdate=10-2-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Janzen–Connell hypothesis''' is a widely accepted explanation for the maintenance of [[tree]] [[species]] [[biodiversity]] in [[tropical rainforests]].  It was published independently in the early 1970s by [[Daniel Janzen]]&lt;ref name="Janzen"&gt;Janzen, Daniel H. "Herbivores and the Number of Tree Species in Tropical Forests." The American Naturalist. 104.940 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joseph Connell]].&lt;ref name="Connell"&gt;Connell, J.H. "On the role of natural enemies in preventing competitive exclusion in some marine animals and in rain forest trees." In: Dynamics of Population. Ed. P.J. Den Boer and G.R. Gradwell. Wageningen: Pudoc, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; According to their hypothesis, [[Host (biology)|host]]-specific [[Herbivore|herbivores]], [[pathogens]], or other [[natural enemies]] (often referred to as [[Predation|predators]]&lt;ref name="Janzen" /&gt;) make the areas near a parent tree (the seed producing tree) inhospitable for the survival of seedlings.  These natural enemies are referred to as 'distance-responsive predators' if they kill seeds or seedlings near the parent tree, or 'density-dependent predators' if they kill seeds or seedlings where they are most abundant (which is typically near the parent tree&lt;ref name="Janzen" /&gt;). Such predators can prevent any one species from dominating the landscape, because if that species is too common, there will be few safe places for its seedlings to survive.  However, because the predators are host-specific (also called [[specialist predator|specialists]]), they will not harm other tree species.  As a result, if a species becomes very rare, then more predator-free areas will become available, giving that species' seedlings a competitive advantage.  This negative feedback allows the tree species to coexist, and can be classified as a [[coexistence theory|stabilizing mechanism]].

The Janzen-Connell hypothesis has been called a special case of [[keystone species|keystone predation]], [[niche partitioning#Types of niche differentiation|predator partitioning]] or the pest pressure hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Carson"&gt;Carson, Walter A. and Stefan A. Schnitzer. Tropical Forest Community Ecology. Blackwell Publishing: Hoboken, NJ, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilbert2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilbert|first1=Gregory|editor1-last=Burslem|editor1-first=David|editor2-last=Pinard|editor2-first=Michelle|editor3-last=Hartley|editor3-first=Sue|title=Biotic interactions in the tropics : their role in the maintenance of species diversity|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9780521609852|pages=141-164}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pest pressure hypothesis states that plant diversity is maintained by specialist natural enemies.&lt;ref name="gillette1962"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillette|first1=J.B.|title=Pest pressure, an underestimated factor in evolution|journal=Taxonomy and Geography; a symposium|date=1962|volume=4|issue=37|pages=37-46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Janzen-Connell hypothesis expands on this, by claiming that the natural enemies are not only specialists, but also are distance-responsive or density-responsive.&lt;ref name="Janzen" /&gt;

This mechanism has been proposed as promoting diversity of forests as it promotes survival of a number of different plant species within one localized region. While previously thought to explain the high diversity of tropical forests in particular, subsequent research has demonstrated the applicability of the Janzen–Connell hypothesis in temperate settings as well. The Black Cherry is one such example of a [[temperate forest]] species whose growth patterns can still be explained by the Janzen–Connell hypothesis.

==History==

===Daniel Janzen’s hypothesis===
Daniel Janzen published his hypothesis in 1970 in ''[[The American Naturalist]]'' under the article "Herbivores and the Number of Tree Species in Tropical Forests."&lt;ref name="Janzen" /&gt; His hypothesis was based on the observation that in tropical forests (when compared to temperate forests), there were few new adult trees in the immediate vicinity of their parent tree. He explained the low density of tropical trees and lack of "bunching" of tree types around parent trees for two reasons: (1) the number of [[seeds]] decline with distance from the parent tree and (2) that the adult tree, its seeds, and seedlings are a source of food for host-specific parasites and diseases.
Using his observations, Janzen created a model demonstrating the probability of a seed maturation or a seedling survival as a function of distance from the parent tree (as well as total seed count, dispersal mechanism, and predatorial activity).

===Joseph Connell hypothesis===
Joseph Connell published his hypothesis in 1971 in Dynamics of Populations.&lt;ref name="Connell" /&gt; Unlike Janzen, Connell proposed experiments that focused on the key prediction that exclusion of host-specific predators would cause a decrease in diversity as tree species with greater establishment or competitive ability formed low-diversity seedling and sapling communities where dominance was concentrated in a few species.

He formed his hypothesis through observations in [[Queensland]], Australia.  Along with Jack Greening Tracey and Larry Johnson Webb, he mapped trees in two rainforests and observed that smaller seedlings tended to occur in single-species clumps.  Smaller seedlings also exhibited greater [[Mortality rate|mortality]], especially when their nearest neighbor was an individual of the same species.  This pattern lessened with growth and age until seedlings exhibited similar pattern diversity to adults.  To reinforce these observations, Connell ran an experiment showing that adult trees have a deleterious effect on smaller trees of the same species.  In another experiment, Connell found that pre-germination predation was greater on seeds near adults of the same species than those near adults of others.  Through these observations, Connell suggests that each tree species has host-specific enemies that attack it and any of its offspring which are close to the parent.  This emphasizes the importance of the role of predation in preventing trees from forming single-species groves, which is probably the only way in which one species of tree could exclude others by interspecies competition.

==Effects on forest dynamics==

===Disease dynamics and tree density===
Plant pathogens follow [[infectious disease dynamics]]. The [[basic reproductive rate]] &lt;math&gt;(R_0)&lt;/math&gt; of a disease is dependent on three variables such that:

&lt;br&gt;{{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} &amp;beta;''L''''S''}}&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Where &amp;beta; is the transmission rate or infectiousness of the disease, ''L'' is the average infection time of the host, and ''S'' is the density of the host population.  By decreasing any one of the variables, the reproduction rate of the disease decreases.  Since seed dispersal is such that the highest density of seeds is around the parent with density decreasing with distance from the parent, the reproduction rate of a disease infecting seeds and seedlings will be highest around the parent and decrease with distance. Thus, seedlings close to the parent are likely to die due to the disease prevalence. However, seedlings farther away are less likely to encounter the disease and therefore will more likely grow into adults.

===Herbivory and tree density===
Specialist herbivores who consume plant matter can also be thought of as having a "transmission rate" between individuals similarly to a disease. Tree predators (especially herbivorous insects) are limited by the ease of movement. When individuals are closer together at high density, movement between trees is easier and the predators quickly spread out. However, at low tree density, predators can not find the next individual with as much ease and thus often have low transmission rates leading to less specialist predation.

==Problematic aspects==

Many studies examining the Janzen–Connell hypothesis have shown supporting patterns with a number of tree species, but despite this there are also problematic aspects of the hypothesis.
# The first is that the Janzen–Connell hypothesis explains diversity at a community-wide scale, but most studies have only looked at a single species or a localized region. Most studies do not test the diversity prediction and did not determine the causes for patterns consistent with Janzen–Connell effects.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;  As Wright (2002) pointed out, "field measurements only demonstrate that niche differences, Janzen–Connell effects, and negative density dependence occur. Implications for species coexistence and plant diversity remain conjectural."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, J.S.  "Plant diversity in tropical forests: a review of mechanisms of species coexistence."  Oecologia. 130.1 (2002): 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt;
# While these host-specific predators may play [[keystone species]] roles as they possibly aid in the prevention of superior tree competitors from monopolizing an area, no study has yet to examine species richness and abundance after removing natural enemies, creating a gap in the supporting research for the hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;
# Diversity may be maintained, at least in part, by episodic outbreaks of specialized pests, which may reduce the survivorship, growth, and [[fecundity|reproductive success]] of adults of a species whenever they are particularly aggregated.  Thus, specialist predation also impacts adult density, rather than just juveniles which has been the focus of research efforts.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;
# Disease and predation may be just affecting overall density rather than in localized regions around adults alone.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;
# Theoretical work has suggested that distance-responsive predators are less able to promote coexistence than equivalent predators that are not distance-responsive.&lt;ref name="stump2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stump|first1=Simon Maccracken|last2=Chesson|first2=Peter|title=Distance-responsive predation is not necessary for the Janzen–Connell hypothesis|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=December 2015|volume=106|pages=60–70|doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2015.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
# Many empirical studies have shown that few natural enemies are host-specific specialists,&lt;ref name="novotny2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Novotny|first1=V.|last2=Basset|first2=Y.|title=Host specificity of insect herbivores in tropical forests|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=7 June 2005|volume=272|issue=1568|pages=1083–1090|doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.3023|pmc=1559807}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the original hypothesis claimed.  However, theoretical work has suggested that predators can have broader diets as long as they are more damaging to their primary host than other species.&lt;ref name="sedio2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sedio|first1=Brian E.|last2=Ostling|first2=Annette M.|last3=Ris Lambers|first3=Janneke Hille|title=How specialised must natural enemies be to facilitate coexistence among plants?|journal=Ecology Letters|date=August 2013|volume=16|issue=8|pages=995–1003|doi=10.1111/ele.12130}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The responses of density-dependent predators' may not be restricted to a single trophic level, and when multiple trophic levels interact, Janzen-Connell effects may be negated. This is an example of "the enemy of my enemy is my friend"  and it has been shown that the potential of host-specific insects to induce negative-density dependence in plant populations can be severely limited when the natural enemies of the seed predators are also density responsive &lt;ref name="VisserMuller-Landau2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Visser|first1=Marco D.|last2=Muller-Landau|first2=Helene C.|last3=Wright|first3=S. Joseph|last4=Rutten|first4=Gemma|last5=Jansen|first5=Patrick A.|title=Tri-trophic interactions affect density dependence of seed fate in a tropical forest palm|journal=Ecology Letters|volume=14|issue=11|year=2011|pages=1093–1100|issn=1461023X|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01677.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Research testing the hypothesis==

===Supporting research===
There have been over 50 studies designed to test predictions of this hypothesis in tropical and other settings and most show that many tree species exhibit patterns consistent with Janzen–Connell effects.  Studies that have supported the Janzen–Connell hypothesis:
* A 2010 study of [[Panama]] forest reinforced that Janzen–Connell effects are also prevalent in tropical rainforests as seedlings growing close to their parents are likely to die due to [[microorganisms]] in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Mangan, Scott A., et al. "Negative plant–soil feedback predicts tree-species relative abundance in a tropical forest." Nature 466 (8 July 2010) 752–755.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2008 study by Petermann ''et al.'' in [[grasslands]] showed that soil-borne pests created a feedback very similar to the Janzen–Connell effect, supporting the hypothesis as a driver of diversity in temperate [[ecosystems]]. This study suggests that the predator/density mechanism that promotes species diversity is not contained to tropical forests alone – even if tropical ecosystems do have the highest diversity. This supports the hypothesis as a mechanism for diversity, but not as an explanation [[latitudinal gradients in species diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;Pertermann, Jana S. et al. "Janzen–Connell Effects are Widespread and Strong Enough to Maintain Diversity in Grasslands." Ecology 89.9 (2008): 2399–2406.&lt;/ref&gt;
* An examination of spatial data for 24 woody tropical rain forest plants showed either density-dependence or distance-dependence in plant offspring, supporting the hypothesis. However, other causal factors such as [[allelopathy]] were also suggested in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Deborah A. and David B. Clark. "Dynamics of a Tropical Rain Forest Tree: Evaluation of the Janzen–Connell Model." The American Naturalist. 124.6 (1984):769–788.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissenting Research===
Studies questioning the Janzen–Connell hypothesis:
* Hyatt ''et al.'' examined the hypothesis across a number of tree species (rather than focusing on the effects on just one) and found no support for the distance-dependence of the hypothesis and concluded that the Janzen–Connell hypothesis was not a mechanism for diversity. They did find however that in temperate settings, distance from parent reduced survivorship. But in tropical settings there was a slight positive correlation between the improved competitive ability of seeds and  distance from parent.&lt;ref name="Hyatt"&gt;Hyatt, Lauren A. et al. "The Distance Dependence Prediction of the Janzen–Connell Hypothesis: a Meta-Analysis." Oikos. 103.3 (2003): 590–602.&lt;/ref&gt;  These findings were later challenged: Using additional data, and slightly different statistical techniques, Comita ''et al.''&lt;ref name="comita_2014_meta"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Comita|first1=Liza S.|last2=Queenborough|first2=Simon A.|last3=Murphy|first3=Stephen J.|last4=Eck|first4=Jenalle L.|last5=Xu|first5=Kaiyang|last6=Krishnadas|first6=Meghna|last7=Beckman|first7=Noelle|last8=Zhu|first8=Yan|last9=Gómez-Aparicio|first9=Lorena|title=Testing predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis: a meta-analysis of experimental evidence for distance- and density-dependent seed and seedling survival|journal=Journal of Ecology|date=July 2014|volume=102|issue=4|pages=845–856|doi=10.1111/1365-2745.12232|pmc=4140603}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that there was strong evidence for distance-dependence at the seedling stage, but not at the seed stage.
* A 1994 study by Burkey found that seed predation did not follow a pattern supporting that of the Janzen–Connell hypothesis along a meaningful scale. Seeds within 1 metre from the trunk were highly predated. However, seeds reached their peak density while still under the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] of their parent. The authors concluded that seed predation did not follow the Janzen–Connell hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Burkey, T.V. "Tree Species Diversity: A Test of the Janzen–Connell Model." Oecologia. 97. (1994): 533–540.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current conclusions and further research==
It is tricky to form conclusions regarding the accuracy of the Janzen–Connell hypothesis as it is difficult to falsify. This is because:
* Heavy predation may keep some species rare and widely spaced, and these species may also be the best competitors.  If so, these species are most likely to form dense aggregations that would reduce diversity in local areas. But due to their rarity or a belief that rare species are not regulated by density-dependence, these species may be the ones least likely to be studied.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;
* This means that the failure to find Janzen–Connell effects for what could be hundreds of tree species does not reject the hypothesis, as ecologists are missing the few key species where it does apply. However, dissenting findings do reduce the importance of the hypothesis for explaining overall coexistence of a number species.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;
** For example, Hyatt ''et al.'' (2003) found that there were "individual cases of conformity to the hypothesis,"&lt;ref name="Hyatt" /&gt; which is all that is needed for the hypothesis to work if the specific cases represent tree species that are excellent competitors, highly shade tolerant, habitat generalists, or some combination of these traits that would allow these species to otherwise dominate the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;

It is likely that a number of mechanisms underscore the coexistence of similar species and thus cause biodiversity in ecosystems. It is possible the Janzen–Connell hypothesis is applicable only for some species depending on species characteristics. The hypothesis may also be affected by the kind of predator or pathogen as preliminary research has shown that the hypothesis is true only when host-specific predators have limited mobility with a range less than the seed dispersal range.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan, Ran and Renato Casagrandi. "A simple mechanistic model of seed dispersal, predation and plant establishment: Janzen–Connell and beyond." Journal of Ecology. 92. (2004): 733–746.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3755">'''Mean world syndrome''' is a term coined by [[George Gerbner]] to describe a [[phenomenon]] whereby [[violence]]-related content of [[mass media]] makes viewers believe that the world is more dangerous than it actually is. Mean world syndrome is one of the main conclusions of [[cultivation theory]]. Gerbner, a pioneer researcher on the [[Social aspects of television|effects of television on society]], argued that people who watch television tended to think of the [[world]] as an [[intimidating]] and unforgiving place. A [[direct correlation]] between the amount of television one watches and the amount of [[fear]] one harbors about the world has been proven, although the direction of causality remains debatable in that persons [[fearful]] of the world may be more likely to retreat from it and in turn spend more time with indoor, [[Solitude|solitary]] activities such as television watching.&lt;ref name="pej"&gt;[http://www.pejnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4053&amp;catid=74:ijustice-news&amp;Itemid=216 George Gerbner Leaves the Mean World Syndrome] Posted by: lex on http://PEJ.org Sunday, January 08, 2006, Peace, Earth &amp; Justice News&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of opinions, images, and attitudes that viewers tend to form when watching television will have a direct influence on how the viewer perceives the real world. They will reflect and refer to the most common images or recurrent messages thought to affect their own real lives.  Gerbner once said: "You know, who tells the stories of a culture really governs human behaviour. It used to be the parent, the school, the church, the community. Now it's a handful of global conglomerates that have nothing to tell, but a great deal to sell."&lt;ref name="pej"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49852245|title=Media effects: advances in theory and research|last=Gerbner|first=G.|last2=Gross|first2=L.|last3=Morgan|first3=M.|last4=Signorielli|first4=N.|last5=Shanahan|first5=J.|date=2002|publisher=Lawrence Elbaum Associates|year=|isbn=9781410602428|editor-last=Jennings|editor-first=Bryant|edition=2nd|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=43-67|chapter=Growing Up with Television: Cultivation Processes|oclc=49852245|editor-last2=Zillmann|editor-first2=Dolf|chapter-url=http://academic.csuohio.edu/kneuendorf/quillin/Gerbneretal%20growing%20up%20with%20television%202002.pdf|chapter-format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerbner says that the spread of the syndrome has become more intense over time. He describes how newer technologies such as [[VCR]], [[DVD]], and cable television do not disturb the cultivation theory, but actually allow more complete access and spread of recurrent messages, although widening access to the Internet world of information can counteract that. The 1930s [[behaviorism]] models, the [[Payne Fund Studies]], show that the effect that mass media has on our behavior is considerable. This is called the [[hypodermic needle model]]: people are injected with appropriate messages and ideas constructed by the mass media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/communication-theories/sorted-by-cluster/Mass%20Media/Hypodermic_Needle_Theory/|title=Mass Media {{!}} Hypodermic Needle Theory|last=|first=|date=September 6, 2004|website=Universiteit Twente|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

'''MesoHABSIM''' builds upon pre-existing physical habitat simulation models (e.g. PHABSIM) which is an essential component of the United States government's methods for establishing minimum [[stream flow]] requirements. 
MesoHABSIM is an augmentation of this system, designed during a restoration study of the [[Quinebaug River]].&lt;ref&gt;Northeast Instream Habitat Program. Northeast Instream Habitat Program – Quinbaug River 10 November. 2008. {{cite web |url=http://neihp.org/projects/quinebaug/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725063409/http://www.neihp.org/projects/quinebaug/index.htm |archivedate=25 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The changing spatial distributions of physical attributes of a river as a result of variations in flow and the biological responses of aquatic species to these changes, provide the basis for simulating the consequences of [[ecosystem]] alteration, and consequently the justification of restoration measures. MesoHABSIM modifies the data acquisition technique and analytical approach of similar models by changing the scale of resolution from micro- to meso-scales. Due to this increase in scale, the model takes variations in stream morphology along the river into account and allows for application in larger-scale projects.

== Data collection and analysis ==

Mesohabitat types are defined by their hydromorphological units (HMUs), such as pools and [[rapids]], [[geomorphology]], [[land cover]] and other [[hydrological]] characteristics. Mesohabitats are mapped under multiple flow conditions at extensive sites along the river. Fish data is collected in randomly distributed mesohabitats where habitat surveys are also conducted. This allows modeling of available fish habitat at a range of flows. Rating curves represent the changes in relative area of suitable habitat in response to flow and allow for the determination of habitat quantity at any given flow within the range of surveys. These rating curves can be developed for river units of any size allowing conclusions to be drawn about the suitability of channel patterns or habitat structures for various species of fish for specific sections as well as for the entire river. Rating curves can also be used to evaluate the benefits of various restoration measures on the entire fish community. In combination with hydrologic time series, rating curves are used to create Continuous Under Threshold (CUT) curves for the analysis of frequency, magnitude and duration of significant habitat events. The CUT curve technique described by Capra et al. (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Capra, H., B. Pascal, and Y. Souchon. 1995. A new tool to interpret magnitude and duration of fish habitat variations. Regulated Rivers: Research and Management. 10: 281–289.&lt;/ref&gt;  defines critical thresholds and determines what habitat variability and availability is necessary to support the target river [[fauna]]. CUT curves evaluate durations of unsuitable habitat under a specified threshold by comparing continuous durations in days under this threshold to the cumulative durations in the study period. A highly useful product of the CUT curves are reference tables that can be used to determine how long a given species can tolerate unsuitable conditions depending on its life stage.

== Results ==

To use physical habitat models to analyze and predict ecosystem potential, compositions must also be determined of the native fish community and a subset of species must be selected for model development. The development of a Reference Fish Community (RFC) is based on the Target Fish Community approach, described by Bain and Meixler (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Meixler. 2000. Defining a Target Fish Community for Planning and Evaluating Enhancement on the Quinebaug River in Massachusetts and Connecticut. Report for Quinebaug River Study Agencies. [[Cornell University]], Ithaca, NY&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive list of species is generated from literature sources and available regional data collected on relatively intact river reaches. The species are ranked on the basis of abundance in long-term fish collection data from multiple rivers of similar character. Securing habitat for naturally occurring [[dominant species (ecology)]] should preserve the most profound characteristics of the ecosystem, providing survival conditions for the majority of the aquatic community and therefore a reference for restoration efforts. The simplest way to create a river habitat model is therefore to select the five to ten highest ranking species for model development. It can then be assumed that community structure reflects habitat structure; therefore, the most common species should indicate the most common habitat. Since habitat availability forms the structure of aquatic fauna, the affinity between the structure of the river habitat and the structure of the fish community can be used as a measure of habitat quality.

The results of MesoHABSIM creates the framework for integrative analysis of many aspects of the ecosystem. It also allows managers to recreate reference conditions and evaluate possible instream and watershed restoration measures or alterations (such as dam removals or changes in water withdrawals). From the perspective of resource managers, it not only allows for quantitative measures of ecological integrity, but also creates a basis for making decisions where trade-offs between resource use and river restoration need to be considered.

'''''Monmouthshire Houses: A Study of Building Techniques and Smaller House-Plans in the Fifteenth to Seventeenth Centuries''''' is a study of buildings within the county of [[Monmouthshire]] written by [[Cyril Fox|Sir Cyril Fox]] and [[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]] and published by [[Amgueddfa Cymru – National Museum Wales]]. The study was published in three volumes; ''Part I Medieval Houses'', ''Part II Sub-Medieval Houses, c. 1550–1610'' and ''Part III Renaissance Houses, c. 1590–1714'', between 1951 and 1954. The series was republished by Merton Priory Press in 1994. A later historian of Welsh architecture has described the work as equal in importance, in its own field, to [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. 

==History==
Sir Cyril Fox (1882–1967), was Director of the National Museum of Wales from 1926 to 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s2-FOX0-FRE-1882.html |title=The National Library of Wales :: Dictionary of Welsh Biography |publisher=Yba.llgc.org.uk |date=1967-01-16 |accessdate=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Fitzroy Somerset, Lord Raglan]], the great-grandson of [[FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan|the 1st Lord Raglan]], British Commander during the [[Crimean War]], was a soldier, author and resident of [[Cefntilla Court]] in Monmouthshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/09/15/archives/lord-raglan-79-dies-in-wales-a-soldier-author-and-historian.html|title=Lord Raglan, 79, Dies in Wales; A Soldier, Author and Historian; Ex‐Grenadier Guards Officer Eladed Slave Traders — Attacked literary Myths|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raglan was also a Commissioner for [[Scheduled monument|Ancient Monuments]] in Wales and both he and Fox were pioneers of the study of [[vernacular architecture]], being founder members of the Vernacular Architecture Group. From the early 1940s until 1949, Fox and Raglan undertook the most extensive survey of lesser Monmouthshire buildings ever undertaken.{{sfn|Fox|Raglan|1994c|p=iv}} Raglan described their methodology in the introduction to the first volume, ''Medieval Houses'', published in 1951. He would identify houses of interest and obtain the necessary permissions from owners, before calling in Fox to undertake a detailed survey.{{sfn|Fox|Raglan|1994c|p=iv}} In the Introduction to the 1994 reprint, Peter Smith, author of ''Houses of the Welsh Countryside'', recorded Raglan's approach; "as we travelled from farmhouse to farmhouse, I realised that his was a name that carried weight and in Monmouthshire opened every door...status and personal charm carried the day and we followed in his wake".{{sfn|Fox|Raglan|1994c|p=iii}} The architectural historian, [[John Newman (architectural historian)|John Newman]], author of the [[Pevsner Architectural Guides|Pevsner]] for Monmouthshire, considered Fox and Raglan's joint work as "ground-breaking, the single most important publication on any aspect of the county's buildings",{{sfn|Newman|2000|p=84}} and Smith described ''Monmouthshire Houses'' as "this landmark in the history of scholarship, a landmark, in its own field, as significant as [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] ''[[Origin of Species]]''".{{sfn|Newman|2000|p=84}}

In the Introduction to ''Sub-Medieval Houses'', the second volume of their history, Fox and Raglan record the genesis of the project. Wartime defensive precautions in 1941 led to a decision by the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]] to demolish an important farmhouse, Upper Wern-hir, near [[Llanbadoc]]. Fox and Raglan obtained permission to survey the building before its destruction and their investigations, together with the threats to Wern-hir and other, similar, buildings, convinced them of the need for a comprehensive survey of such structures throughout Monmouthshire.{{sfn|Fox|Raglan|1994b|pp=15–16}}

==Description==
The three-volume work comprises detailed studies of over 400 houses and farmhouses built in Monmouthshire between the [[medieval]] period and 1714.{{sfn|Fox|Raglan|1994a|loc=preface}} The volumes are:

'''Near Instantaneous Companded Audio Multiplex''' ('''NICAM''') is an early form of [[lossy compression]] for [[digital audio]].  It was originally developed in the early 1970s for point-to-point links within broadcasting networks.&lt;ref name="croll"&gt;Croll, M.G., Osborne, D.W. and Spicer, C.R. (1974), ''Digital sound signals: the present BBC distribution system and a proposal for bit-rate reduction by digital companding''. IEE Conference publication No. 119, pp. 90–96&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, broadcasters began to use NICAM compression for transmissions of stereo TV sound to the public.

== History ==
=== Near-instantaneous companding ===
The idea was first described in 1964. In this, the 'ranging' was to be applied to the analogue signal before the [[Analog-to-digital converter|analogue-to-digital converter (ADC)]] and after the [[Digital-to-analog converter|digital-to-analogue converter (DAC)]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, C.J.C. and Greszczuk, J. (1964), ''Companding in a p.c.m. system''. Symposium on Transmission Aspects of Communication Networks, London, IEE 1964, pp. 183–186. &lt;/ref&gt; The application of this to broadcasting, in which the [[companding]] was to be done entirely digitally after the ADC and before the DAC, was described in a 1972 [[BBC Research]] Report.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, D.W. (1972) [http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/publications/rdreport_1972_31 ''Digital sound signals: further investigation of instantaneous and other rapid companding systems''.] BBC Research Dept. Report 1972/31.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Point-to-point links ===
NICAM was originally intended to provide broadcasters with six high-quality audio channels within a total bandwidth of 2048 kbit/s. This figure was chosen to match the [[E-carrier level 1|E1]] primary multiplex rate, and systems using this rate could make use of the planned [[Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy|PDH]] national and international telecommunications networks.

Several similar systems had been developed in various countries, and in about 1977/78 the [[BBC Research|BBC Research Department]] conducted listening tests to evaluate them. The candidates were:
* A [[RAI]] system which used [[A-law]] companding to compress 14-bit linear PCM samples into 10 bits (14:10)
* A NICAM-type system proposed by [[Télédiffusion de France]] (14:9)
* NICAM-1 (13:10)
* NICAM-2 (14:11)
* NICAM-3 (14:10)

It was found that NICAM-2 provided the best sound quality, but reduced programme-modulated noise to an unnecessarily low level at the expense of bit rate. NICAM-3, which had been proposed during the test to address this, was selected as the winner.&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;Jones, A.H. (1978), ''Digital coding of audio signals for point-to-point transmission''. IEE Conference Publication No. 166, pp. 25–28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilchrist, N.H.C. (1978), [http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/publications/rdreport_1978_26 ''Digital sound signals: tests to compare the performance of five companding systems for high-quality sound signals''.] BBC Research Department Report 1978/26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Audio is encoded using 14 [[bit]] [[pulse-code modulation]] at a sampling rate of 32 [[kHz]].

=== Broadcasts to the public ===
 
NICAM's second role – transmission to the public – was developed in the 80s by the [[BBC]]. This variant was known as NICAM-728, after the 728 kbit/s [[bitstream]] it is sent over. It uses the same audio coding parameters as NICAM-3.

The first NICAM digital [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] programme was broadcast on BBC2 in 1986, though programmes were not advertised as being broadcast in stereo on the BBC until some five years later, when the majority of the country's transmitters had been upgraded to broadcast NICAM, and a large number of BBC programmes were being made in stereo.

The BBC publicly launched their NICAM stereo service in the [[United Kingdom]] on Saturday 31 August 1991 (see [[1991 in television]]) though other UK broadcasters [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[Channel 4]] advertised this capability some months earlier. Channel 4 began tests much earlier in February 1989 via the Crystal Palace transmitter in London.

It has been standardized as ETS EN 300 163.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etsi.org/ ETSI] ETS EN 300 163,  (previously: [http://www.ebu.ch EBU] T 3266)&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Hong Kong]] (commonly used for dual language for programming containing both Cantonese and English/Mandarin/Japanese/Korean soundtracks; planned to cease by 2020 when digital TV broadcasting transition is complete and analogue TV transmissions will be stopped)
* [[Singapore]] (Full switchover to DVB-T2 to be completed on 31 December 2018. NICAM will became historical from that date.)
* [[Macau]]
* [[Guangzhou]]
* [[South Africa]] (SABC1, SABC2, etv)
* [[Malaysia]]
** Used by [[Radio Televisyen Malaysia|TV1, TV2]], [[ntv7]], [[8TV (Malaysia)|8TV]], and [[TV9 (Malaysia)|TV9]] around Klang Valley. [[TV3 (Malaysia)|TV3]] also uses NICAM on their VHF transmission frequency (Channel 12) in the Klang Valley, but uses Zweikanalton on their UHF transmission frequency (Channel 29).
* [[New Zealand]] (Full switchover to DVB-T complete by 1 December 2013. NICAM became historical from that date.)
* [[Indonesia]]
** Television stations in Indonesia use NICAM Stereo for analogue television. Full switchover to DVB-T2 is expected to complete by 2020 by which all analogue broadcasting have ceased.
*[[Thailand]]
** Used on [[Channel 3 (Thailand)|Channel 3]] and [[Channel 9 MCOT HD]] (Except [[Thai Public Broadcasting Service|Thai PBS]] usually broadcast in stereo  but analog broadcast has been cease on 16 June 2018; Switched to terrestrial [[DVB-T2]])
Some other countries use [[Zweikanalton]] analogue stereo instead. Analogue stereo conversion thus begins.

== How NICAM works ==
In order to provide [[Monaural|mono]] "compatibility", the NICAM signal is transmitted on a [[subcarrier]] alongside the sound carrier. This means that the [[Frequency modulation|FM]] regular mono sound carrier is left alone for reception by monaural receivers.

A NICAM-based stereo-TV infrastructure can transmit a stereo TV programme as well as the mono "compatibility" sound at the same time, or can transmit two or three entirely different sound streams. This latter mode could be used to transmit audio in different languages, in a similar manner to that used for [[in-flight movie]]s on international flights. In this mode, the user can select which soundtrack to listen to when watching the content by operating a "sound-select" control on the receiver.

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:NICAM-spectrum.png|600px]] --&gt;

This is the spectrum of NICAM on the PAL system. On the SECAM L system, the NICAM sound carrier is at 5.85 MHz, a point below the FM sound carrier, and the video bandwidth is reduced from 6.5 MHz to 5.5 MHz.

NICAM currently offers the following possibilities. The mode is automatically selected by the inclusion of a 3-bit type field in the data stream.
* One digital stereo sound channel. 
* Two completely different digital mono sound channels. 
* One digital mono sound channel and a 352 kbit/s data channel. 
* One 704 kbit/s data channel. 

The four other options could be implemented at a later date. Only the first two of the ones listed are known to be in general use however. 

=== NICAM packet transmission ===

The NICAM packet (except for the header) is scrambled with a nine-bit pseudo-random bit-generator before transmission.
* The topology of this pseudo-random generator yields a bitstream with a repetition period of 511 bits.
* The pseudo-random generator's [[polynomial code|polynomial]] is: &lt;math&gt;x^9 + x^4 + 1.&lt;/math&gt;
* The pseudo-random generator is initialized with: &lt;math&gt;111111111.&lt;/math&gt;

Making the NICAM bitstream look more like [[white noise]] is important because this reduces signal patterning on adjacent TV channels.
* The NICAM header is not subject to scrambling. This is necessary so as to aid in locking on to the NICAM data stream and resynchronisation of the data stream at the receiver.
* At the start of each NICAM packet the pseudo-random bit generator's shift register is reset to all ones.

=== NICAM transmission issues ===

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:NICAM-spectrum-PAL B G.png|600px]] --&gt;

There are some latent issues involved with the processing of NICAM audio in the transmission chain.
* NICAM (unlike the Compact Disc standard) samples 14-bit audio at 32 kHz.
* The upper frequency limit of a NICAM sound channel is 15 kHz due to anti-aliasing filters at the encoder. 
* The original 14-bit PCM audio samples are companded digitally to 10 bits for transmission.
* NICAM audio samples are divided into blocks of 32. If all the samples in a block are quiet, such that the [[most significant bit]]s are all zeros, these bits can be discarded at no loss.
* On louder samples some of the [[least significant bit]]s are truncated, with the hope that they will be inaudible.
* A 3-bit control signal for each block records which bits were discarded.
* Digital companding (using a [[CCITT J.17]] pre-emphasis curve) ensures that the encoding and decoding algorithms can track perfectly.

=== NICAM carrier power ===
ITU (and CCITT) standards specify that the power level of the NICAM signal should be at -20 dB with respect to the power of the vision carrier.
* The level of the FM mono sound carrier must be at least -13 dB.
* Measuring the modulation level of the NICAM signal is difficult because the QPSK NICAM carrier waveform (unlike AM or FM modulated carrier waveforms) is not emitted at a discrete frequency.

When measured with spectrum analyser the actual level of the carrier
(L) can be calculated using the following formula:

L(NICAM) = L(Measured) + 10 log (R/BWAnalyser) + K

# L(NICAM) = actual level of the NICAM carrier [dBμV]
# L(Measured) = measured level of the NICAM carrier [dBμV]
# R = -3 dB bandwidth of the signal [kHz]
# BWAnalyser = bandwidth of the spectrum analyser [kHz]
# K = logarithmic form factor of the spectrum analyser ~2 dB

note: if BWAnalyser is greater than R, the formula becomes L(NICAM) = L(Measured) + K

== NICAM's unusual features ==
NICAM sampling is not standard [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] sampling, as commonly employed with the [[Compact Disc]] or at the codec level in [[MP3]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] or [[Ogg]] audio devices. NICAM sampling more closely resembles [[ADPCM|Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation]], or [[A-law]] companding with an extended, rapidly modifiable dynamic range.

=== Two's complement signing ===
The [[two's complement]] method of signing the samples is used,&lt;ref name="AllYouEverWanted"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stoneship.org.uk/~steve/nicam.html |title="All You Ever Wanted to Know About NICAM but were Afraid to Ask" |author=Steve Hosgood |accessdate=2007-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050214130459/http://stoneship.org.uk/~steve/nicam.html |archivedate=February 14, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; so that:
* &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;"&gt;01111111111111&lt;/span&gt; represents positive full-scale
* &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;"&gt;10000000000000&lt;/span&gt; represents negative full-scale

=== ±0 V has three binary representations ===
* &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;"&gt;00000000000001&lt;/span&gt; represents 0 V, with no +/- distinction. This may have originated as a method to reduce the emergence of DC patterns from transmission of silent material.
* &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;"&gt;00000000000000&lt;/span&gt; represents 0 V, with no +/- distinction
* &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;"&gt;11111111111111&lt;/span&gt; represents 0 V, with no +/- distinction

=== Parity checking limited to only 6 of 10 bits ===
In order to strengthen parity protection for the sound samples, the parity bit is calculated on only the top six bits of each NICAM sample. Early BBC NICAM research showed that uncorrected errors in the least significant four bits were preferable to the reduced overall protection offered by parity-protecting all ten bits.

== Recording of NICAM audio ==
===VCR===
{{main|Videocassette recorder}}
[[VHS]] and [[Betamax]] home [[videocassette recorder]]s ("VCR"s) initially only recorded the audio tracks using a fixed linear recording head, which was inadequate for recording NICAM audio; this significantly limited their sound quality. Many VCRs later included high quality stereo audio recording as an additional feature, in which the incoming high quality stereo audio source (typically [[FM radio]] or NICAM TV) was [[frequency modulation|frequency modulated]] and then recorded in addition to the usual audio and video VCR tracks, using the same [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|high-bandwidth]] [[helical scan]]ning technique used for the video signal. Full size VCRs already made full use of the tape, so the high quality audio signal was recorded diagonally ''under'' the video signal, using additional [[helical scan]] heads and [[depth multiplexing]]. The mono audio track (and on some machines, a non-NICAM, non-Hi-Fi stereo track) was also recorded on the linear track, as before, to ensure backwards-compatibility of recordings made on Hi-Fi machines when played on non-Hi-Fi VCRs.

Such devices were often described as "HiFi audio", "Audio FM" / "AFM" (FM standing for "Frequency Modulation"), and sometimes informally as "Nicam" VCRs (due to their use in recording the Nicam broadcast audio signal). They remained compatible with non-HiFi VCR players since the standard audio track was also recorded, and were at times used as an alternative to [[audio cassette tape]]s due to their exceptional bandwidth, frequency range, and extremely flat [[frequency response]].

===DVD===
While recording in video mode (compatible with [[DVD-Video]]), most [[DVD recorder]]s can only record one of the three channels (Digital I, Digital II, Analogue mono) allowed by the standard. Newer standard such as [[DVD-VR]] allows recording all the digital channels (in both stereo and bilingual mode), whereas the mono channel will be lost.

===Flash memory and computer multimedia===
Codecs for digital media on computers will often convert NICAM to another digital audio format to compress drive space.

'''Nordic Classicism''' was a [[Architectural style|style of architecture]] that briefly blossomed in the [[Nordic countries]] ([[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[Finland]]) between 1910 and 1930.

Until a resurgence of interest for the period during the 1980s (marked by several scholarly studies and public exhibitions), Nordic Classicism was regarded as a mere interlude between two far more well-known architectural movements, [[National Romantic Style|National Romanticism]], or ''[[Jugendstil]]'' (often seen as equivalent or parallel to [[Art Nouveau]]), and [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] (aka [[Modernist architecture|Modernism]]).

== History ==
[[File:Københavns Politigård under construction.jpg|thumb|[[Copenhagen Police Headquarters]] (1924) by [[Hack Kampmann]].]]
The development of Nordic Classicism was no isolated phenomenon, but took off from [[Classical architecture|classical]] traditions already existing in the Nordic countries, and from new ideas being pursued in German-speaking cultures. Nordic Classicism can thus be characterised as a combination of direct and indirect influences from [[vernacular]] architecture (Nordic, Italian and German) and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassicism]], but also the early stirrings of Modernism from the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] – especially their exhibition of 1914 - and by the mid-1920s the ''Esprit Nouveau'' emerging from the theories of [[Le Corbusier]].

The modernist influence went beyond mere aesthetics: [[urbanisation]] tied to modern building techniques and the introduction of regulations both in building and [[town planning]], and moreover, to the rise of social forces that resulted in a change in political ideology toward the Left, resulting in the [[Nordic welfare state]], and new programmes for public buildings such as hospitals (e.g. the [[Beckomberga Hospital]] in western [[Stockholm]] (1927-1935) by [[Carl Westman]]) and schools (e.g. the Fridhemsplan school, Stockholm, (1925–27) by Georg A. Nilsson). But while Nordic classicism was employed for a number of important public buildings, it was also applied as a model for low-cost housing (e.g. the [[Käpylä|Puu-Käpylä]] Garden Town, Helsinki (1920–25) by Martti Välikangas) and domestic architecture in general (e.g. an affordable sense of style for the nouveau-riche).

1930 is usually considered the end point of Nordic Classicism because that was the year of the [[Stockholm Exhibition (1930)|Stockholm Exhibition]], designed mostly by [[Gunnar Asplund]] and [[Sigurd Lewerentz]], when a more purist Modernism was unveiled as a model for a modern society. However, key buildings continued to be built in the classical style after that, notably Östberg's Maritime Museum in Stockholm (1931–34).

== Notable architects ==
[[File:Parliament building Finland.jpg|thumb|[[Eduskuntatalo|Parliament of Finland]], Helsinki (1926-1931) by [[Johan Sigfrid Sirén]]]]
[[File:Rathaus Haugesund.jpg|thumb|right|Haugesund City Hall (1922-1931) by [[Gudolf Blakstad]] and [[Herman Munthe-Kaas]]]]

Certain architects had reached the culmination of their careers already when the [[National Romantic style]] came, but their latter works were in the Nordic Classicism style (e.g. [[Carl Westman]]), the career of others culminated with Nordic Classicism (e.g. [[Ivar Tengbom]] and [[Ragnar Östberg]]), while others later went on to achieve far greater significance as Modernist architects (e.g. [[Arne Jacobsen]], [[Alvar Aalto]], and [[Sven Markelius]]). The two figures who achieved greatest significance in both periods, however, were Swedish architects [[Gunnar Asplund]] and [[Sigurd Lewerentz]].

'''[[Architecture of Denmark|Denmark]]''': [[Kay Fisker]], [[Hack Kampmann]], [[Kaj Gottlob]], [[Ivar Bentsen]], [[Povl Baumann]], [[Poul Holsøe]], [[Edvard Thomsen]], [[Thomas Havning]], [[Holger Jacobsen]], [[Kaare Klint]], [[Arne Jacobsen]], [[Carl Petersen (architect)|Carl Petersen]], [[Aage Rafn]], [[Steen Eiler Rasmussen]], [[Sven Risom]], and [[Frits Schlegel]].

'''[[Architecture of Finland|Finland]]''': [[Gunnar Taucher]], [[Uno Ullberg]], [[Martti Välikangas]], [[J.S. Sirén]], [[Alvar Aalto]], [[Pauli E. Blomstedt]], [[Elsi Borg]], [[Erik Bryggman]], [[Hilding Ekelund]], [[Heikki Siikonen]], and [[Oiva Kallio]].

'''[[Architecture of Norway|Norway]]''': [[Lars Backer]], [[Lorentz Ree]], [[Sverre Pedersen]], [[Nicolai Beer]], [[Finn Berner]], [[Harald Hals]], [[Herman Munthe-Kaas]], [[Gudolf Blakstad]], [[Finn Bryn]], [[Jens Dunker]] and [[Johan Ellefsen]].

'''[[Architecture of Sweden|Sweden]]''': [[Ragnar Östberg]], [[Gunnar Asplund]], [[Carl Westman]], [[Sigurd Lewerentz]], [[Carl Bergsten]], [[Sigfrid Ericson]], [[Torben Grut]], [[Ragnar Hjorth]], [[Cyrillus Johansson]], [[Erik Lallerstedt]], [[Gunnar Leche]], [[Sven Markelius]], [[Gunnar Morssing]], [[George Nilsson]], [[Ture Ryberg]], [[Albin Stark]], [[Eskil Sundahl]], [[Lars Israel Wahlman]], [[Sven Wallander]], [[Hakon Ahlberg]] and [[Ivar Tengbom]].

Though these architects are listed by country, during this period there was an intense cultural exchange among the Nordic countries (many architects worked in more than one), but also considerable development in the architect's sphere of activity, from consultant to the bourgeoisie to town planner concerned with infrastructure, dwelling and public services. As Swedish historian Henrik O. Anderson (1982: 23), has put it, this was an architecture of democracy, not radical [[avant-garde|avant-gardism]]. Furthermore, with the exception of Finland, the other Nordic countries had avoided getting involved in the [[World War I|First World War]], allowing for continued cultural development.

== Relationship to other movements ==

Interest in Nordic Classicism, especially in its most classical form, arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s at the height of [[postmodern architecture|postmodernism]] when critics, historians and architecture teachers were looking for historical precedents for the architecture of such architects as [[Michael Graves]], [[Leon Krier]] and [[Robert A. M. Stern|Robert Stern]]. Nordic classicism provided that precedent, especially with such seminal buildings as Gunnar Asplund's Scandia Cinema in Stockholm (1924), Listers District Courthouse (1917–21), Villa Snellman in [[Djursholm]] (1917–18) and [[Stockholm Public Library]] (1920-28), as well as the landscape and buildings of the [[Skogskyrkogården]] Cemetery, Stockholm (1917-1940) by both Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz.

In regards to architectural style, there were several precedents or reasons which account for the rise of Nordic Classicism. First was the existing classical tradition, borne from the architecture of [[Absolute monarchy|Absolutism]] &amp;ndash; that is, the classical architectural symbols of power of the Swedish and Danish monarchies &amp;ndash; down to the vernacular, for instance in terms of considerations for symmetry, detailing and proportion.

Throughout the 19th century there were a number of factors contributing to a more simplified classicism. The teachings of [[Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand|J.N.L. Durand]] at the [[École Polytechnique]] of Paris at the beginning of the 19th century had attempted to rationalise the language and building techniques of classicism, while allowing for simple additive compositions. Durand's teachings spread, entering German culture in the form of Romantic Classicism with the work of [[Friedrich Gilly]] and [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]. Scholars were at the time uncovering the remnants of [[Pompeii]], and discovering the use of bright colour in Roman architecture – an aspect that had more or less been forgotten in the [[Renaissance]], but also rediscovering Greece and Egypt. These aspects were incorporated into Neoclassicism and continued into Nordic Classicism (e.g. The [[Thorvaldsen Museum]], [[Copenhagen]], 1839–48, by M.G. Bindesbøll, incorporates Egyptian motifs as does Asplund's Stockholm Public Library).

There are also 'circles of reaction' to consider. Art Nouveau and National Romanticism had little impact in Denmark, while in Sweden, Norway and Finland there were also strong National Romantic reactions. Neoclassicism had arrived in Finland via [[Saint Petersburg]] as a universal language but by the end of the 19th century came to represent an alien presence – that of [[Russia]]. Thus when stirrings of political independence appeared in Finland and  Norway, a rugged, national romantic architecture – a local variation of Art Nouveau – playing on the nationalistic myths, took hold. Nordic classicism was thus a counter-reaction to that style and eclecticism in general; a movement toward [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]]ism, internationalism and simplification.

Many of the architects who practiced in the Nordic Classical style made pilgrimages to northern [[Italy]] to study Italian vernacular architecture. With close cultural links at that time between the Nordic countries and Germany, another important source came from German critics of Art Nouveau, in particular [[Hermann Muthesius]] – who had been a promoter of the English [[Arts and Crafts movement]] and founded the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] in 1907 - and Paul Schultze-Naumburg, as well as the latter’s student [[Heinrich Tessenow]], and [[Peter Behrens]].

In turn, the thinking in Nordic Classicism became one of the basis for the development of Modernism in the Nordic Countries. The idea that there would have been a continuity between vernacular and modernism has been seen as counter to received historical opinion about the rise of Modernism, beginning with [[Le Corbusier]] and his [[Le Corbusier#Five points of architecture|5 Points for Architecture]], which are seen as overturning 5 basic principles of Classicism. A demonstration in real time of the move from Nordic Classicism to a pure Functionalism is offered by Alvar Aalto's design for the [[Viipuri Library]] (1927–35), which went through a profound transformation from the original architectural competition proposal in 1927 (owing much to Gunnar Asplund) to the severely functionalist building, completed eight years later in a purist modernist style, influenced by Le Corbusier.

'''Peace Mala''' ('''The Peace Mala Project for World Peace'''), is an organisation based in [[Morriston]] in [[Swansea]], [[Wales]] dedicated to fostering inter-cultural and inter-faith tolerance through the manufacture, distribution and wearing of a symbolic [[Japa mala|mala]] (bracelet) whose beads represent various faiths.

The organisation's stated aims are "promotion of understanding, respect, friendship, tolerance and peace between all communities, cultures and enlightened, compassionate faiths".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacemala.org.uk/ From the 'Main aims of Peace Mala']&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Peace Mala bracelet==
A Peace Mala is a symbolic bracelet used to promote the message of the [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]] of mutual respect recognised by many spiritual paths. It consists of 16 beads, forming a double rainbow, which represent Christianity, [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]], [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|ISKCON]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Folk religion|Tribal and Native Religions]], [[Jainism]], [[Earth religion]]s, [[Taoism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Bön#Yungdrung Bön|Yungdrung Bön]]. The central white bead represents the wearer and whatever path they follow, with two knots on the elastic thread: one  symbolising the wearer's uniqueness, the other a reminder of [[causality]] and the path of peace and friendship to follow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacemala.org.uk/bow2.html Official description of the symbology and representations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831214813/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/bow2.html |date=31 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Peace Mala was founded in 2002 by Pam Evans, former Head of the Department of Religious Studies at Coedcae Comprehensive School in [[Llanelli]], Carmarthenshire, Wales. The idea arose from class discussions about the contribution of the "[[September 11 attacks|9/11]]" attacks in New York to [[Islamophobia]], racism, religious intolerance and [[fundamentalism]] worldwide, as well as local effects exemplified by the experience of the student Imran Sheikh: "''I suffered from racist taunts and our local mosque was attacked following September 11 and that is when the Peace Mala all started.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/3162388.stm Word spreads of 'peace mala'], BBC Wales interview upon winning first prize in the ChildLine in Partnership with Schools (CHIPS) initiative.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Evans gave up her position as Head of Department at Coedcae School to focus on her work with Peace Mala.  On 16 November 2006, (25th Shawwal 1427 [[Islamic calendar|AH]]), Evans was awarded the ''Noble Soul'' Award 2006 in recognition of her outstanding contribution to challenging Islamophobia in schools.  The award was presented by RAHMA (Racial Attacks and Harassment Monitoring Association) on the ''International Day of Peace.''

===Launch===
Peace Mala was officially launched in the [[Temple of Peace, Cardiff|UNA Temple of Peace]] in [[Cardiff]] on Wednesday 27 November 2002 by [[Archbishop of Wales]] [[Rowan Williams]] (later [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]). He was joined by members of the fourteen faiths represented on the Peace Mala bracelet, whose procession opened the ceremony, along with NGOs, students and teachers of schools from across Wales, lecturers from the University of Wales, and pupils and staff of Coedcae Comprehensive School.

===Awards===
Through the promotion of peace, tolerance and respect, Peace Mala has received numerous awards for their work, notably [[The Prince's Trust]] Millennium Award in 2003, the [[The Co-operative Group|Co-op]] Community Dividend Award in 2003, the [[ChildLine]] Cymru CHIPS Friendship and Respect Award in 2003 (1st Prize), and the Carmarthenshire Police Community Challenge Award in 2004.  In 2004 Peace Mala was also awarded First Prize in the [[CEWC-Cymru]] "Right-On" National Competition to promote Human Rights in Welsh schools. In 2006 Peace Mala was awarded a grant by Awards for All (Wales) in support of the Peace Mala Awards for Youth.

==Charitable status==
On 21 February 2007, Peace Mala, already a [[company limited by guarantee]] and not having a share capital, was entered in the [[Central Register of Charities]] as Registered Charity No. 1118053.

==Patrons==
[[Rowan Williams]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], was patron of Peace Mala from 2003 until 2008, and was succeeded by Lama Khemsar Rinpoche, Spiritual Director of the ''Yundrung Bön Study Centre''.

===Rowan Williams===
Williams and Evans first met when he visited Coedcae School to give talks to the pupils about his work as Archbishop of Wales, a position now held by [[Barry Morgan]].  Williams was one of the first persons to be contacted by Evans when she came up with the idea of the Peace Mala. One of Williams's final acts as Archbishop of Wales was to join 14 other religious dignitaries in the launch of the Peace Mala in November 2002.

In 2003 Evans invited Williams to be a patron; he held the position until 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Most Reverend Dr Rowan Williams  Archbishop Of Canterbury|url=http://www.peacemala.org.uk/patrons/rowan.html|publisher=www.peacemala.org.uk|accessdate=12 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030815001700/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/patrons/rowan.html|archivedate=15 August 2003|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lama Khemsar Rinpoche===
Lama Khemsar Rinpoche also visited Coedcae School prior to his involvement with Peace Mala.  Rinpoche left [[Tibet]] in 1959, and is the first resident Lama of the Yungdrung Bön tradition in Europe. He also teaches widely in the US.

Evans invited Lama Khemsar Rinpoche to be a patron of the organisation, and he accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lama Khemsar Rinpoche, Spiritual Director  Of The Tibetan Yungdrung Bon Study Centre|url=http://www.peacemala.org.uk/patrons/rinpoche.html|publisher=www.peacemala.org.uk|accessdate=12 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195024/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/patrons/rinpoche.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Lama Khemsar Rinpoche's students have made use of the main room in the Peace Mala Registered Office for their weekly Bön [[Ngöndro|Zogchen Ngöndro]] prayers and meditations. The Tibetan room at the centre is often used by Rinpoche when he visits Wales.

==Website==
The Peace Mala website was created in 2002 using money granted by the Princes Trust Millennium Award. It was designed and published using 100% [[solar power]] by the web publishing company Arcania. The website includes news articles relating to Peace Mala activities and endorsements from prominent religious leaders, political dignitaries and celebrities including the [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama|the 14th Dalai Lama]], [[Jillian Evans]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], Sir [[Mark Tully]] [[Beth Nielsen Chapman]], [[Bonnie Tyler]] and Barbara Dickson.

==Registered office==
On Wednesday 18 August 2004, the Peace Mala Registered Office was officially opened during a ceremony attended by the Lord Mayor and Consort of the City of Swansea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opening Of The Registered Office For Peace Mala|url=http://www.peacemala.org.uk/news/centre/centre.html|publisher=www.peacemala.org.uk|accessdate=12 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192928/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/news/centre/centre.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The registered office is used as a base for Peace Mala activities including workshops and public talks. Yungdrung Bön practitioners in Wales also use the centre for their weekly ''Bon Zogchen Ngon-Dro'' prayers and meditations. Yungdrung Bön (meaning ''Eternal Light'' or ''Enlightened Teaching'') is the pre-Buddhist [[Bön]] faith of [[Tibet]].

===Peace Garden===
Attached to the registered office is a peace garden with many features including a shrine to [[Saint Francis of Assisi]], [[Buddharupa|Buddhist statues]] and [[prayer flags]], a miniature [[Zen]]-style stone garden, water features, and a tree area which has been blessed in a ceremony led by [[Neopaganism|Witches]], and [[Druid]]s.  There is also a tranquil area facing [[Mecca]], which is dedicated to the [[Islam|Muslim faith]].

==Aims==
Peace Mala outlined its "Main Aims" as:
*Education for global citizenship through the promotion of understanding, respect, friendship, tolerance and peace between all communities, cultures and enlightened, compassionate faiths.
*Peace Mala supports human rights, confronts bullying and all forms of prejudice.
*Peace Mala raises awareness of issues of global interdependence and encourages active compassion by learners that will effect positive changes locally and globally.

==Educational work==
Peace Mala works to engages with schools to educate youths into becoming "''global citizens through the promotion of respect, friendship, tolerance and peace between all communities and faiths''".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Alex, "Youngsters honoured for promoting peace", ''South Wales Evening Post'', 22 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Awards for Youth===
In 2006 Peace Mala launched the ''Peace Mala Awards for Youth''.  The awards and competition encourage young people "''...  to become aware of and involved with issues of peace, justice, tolerance and friendship.''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacemala.org.uk/awards/2006/index.html Peace Mala, PEACE MALA NATIONAL AWARDS FOR YOUTH  Award Winners 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420011636/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/awards/2006/index.html |date=20 April 2012 }}. ''Retrieved 18 April 2013''&lt;/ref&gt; The competition focuses in issues of equality, human rights and global citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.positivenews.org.uk/2007/archive/1144/peace-mala-international-youth-awards/ "Peace Mala International Youth Awards"], ''Positive News'', 17 October 2007. ''Retrieved 18 April 2013''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Youth Awards allows entrants from educational institutions, youth groups and faith groups. Two prizes are awarded: one for juniors (5–11) and the other for seniors (12–18). The awards were accompanied by cash prizes, and occasionally donated gifts such as commemorative framed posters signed by Gary Marlon Suson from the Ground Zero Museum Workshop.

In 2007 the Peace Mala Awards for Youth became an international competition with youth groups in the USA taking part in the project.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Kay, "Peace hopes win top prize", ''South Wales Evening Post'', 27 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the Awards were superseded by the Peace Mala Accreditation.

===Accreditation for Schools, Youth Groups and Community Groups===
In September 2009 Peace Mala celebrated the last Youth Awards ceremony, where the Awards were replaced an accreditation for schools, youth groups and community groups.  As the Awards had focused on competitive engagement by schools and some youth groups, the accreditation would be more cooperative and inclusive.  Schools and groups are encouraged to include the vision and objectives of Peace Mala within their ethos via the seven criteria and accreditation is awarded when the seven criteria have been successfully fulfilled as outlined in the self-assessment form available to applicants. These seven areas are intended to fit into the school, youth group or community group's values system and are in line with the objectives and vision of Peace Mala.

Applicants for accreditation are judged against seven key criteria:

# Community cohesion and global citizenship
# Needs and human rights
# Interdependence
# Active compassion
# Celebrating diversity
# Environmental responsibilities and sustainable change
# Conflict resolution and peace education

==Interfaith engagement==
Along with education and youth engagement, with the religious nature of its founding, Peace Mala engages regularly with interfaith and diversity engagement and occasions. Awareness events and fundraisers are regular occurrences.

===Pilgrimages===
Pilgrimages have been used by Peace Mala as a means of promotion, but also as a means to engage communities in interfaith involvement and raise awareness of local areas of interest and community diversity.

====Santiago de Compostela====

====Gower====
In May 2011, volunteers discovered a route map which may have been a pilgrimage path linking the Celtic churches of the [[Gower Peninsula]], as well pre-Christian sites such as holy wells and [[Dolmen|cromlech]] stones. A pilgrimage was organised, therefore, the next year to celebrate Peace Mala's first decennial year. The pilgrimage included one pilgrim who was joined at different legs of the pilgrimage culminating in a ceremony at St. Rhidian's Church in [[Llanrhidian]]. For the pilgrimage, Pam Evans travelled to Kildare to receive the flame of Brigid of the [[Brigidine Sisters]] of the Solas Bhríde hermitage; she then received the [[World Peace Flame]] at the [[Dru yoga|Dru International]] Training Centre for Education and Wellbeing in [[Snowdonia National Park]]; finally, various faith representatives attended a ceremony where a flame was blessed at the shrine of St David at [[St David's Cathedral]] by The Very Revd [[Jonathan Lean]]. These three flames were used during the start of the pilgrimage, where the lights were blessed by The Rt Revd [[John Davies (bishop of Swansea and Brecon)|John Davies]], [[Bishop of Swansea and Brecon]]; as well as at the end, where the flames were blessed by numerous faith representatives including Muslim, Druid and Buddhists, as well as [[ISKCON]] sannyasa who greeted the pilgrims with kirtan.

At each of the sites visited, the main pilgrim lit votive candles and recited a prayer composed for the pilgrimage. She was joined on various days by school children as well as fellow pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;"Pilgrims step out on peace walk", ''[[South Wales Evening Post]]'', 26 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

====Llangyfelach "Forgotten" Monastery====
On Thursday 9 May 2013, Ascension Day, Peace Mala led a one-day pilgrimage as means of a revival of a postulated pilgrimage route to a now-defunct early Celtic monastery founded by St David on the site of the current parish Church of St David and St Cyfelach in [[Llangyfelach]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Paul, "Old tradition revived by pilgrimage", ''South Wales Evening Post'', 10 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The participants in the pilgrimage included pupil from St John Lloyd Catholic School in Llanelli, Hafod Primary School in Swansea and Catwg Primary School. Also in procession were dignitaries from numerous faith, including The Rt Rev'd [[John Davies (bishop of Swansea and Brecon)|John Davies]], [[Bishop of Swansea and Brecon]], as well as representatives from the [[Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University]], the [[Catholic Church]], [[Anglican Communion]] and [[Kagyu]] Tibetan Buddhism among many others.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Pam, "Peace Mala Pilgrimage to Saint David's Forgotten Monastery", ''Diocesan News: The Diocese of Swansea &amp; Brecon '', Issue № 18, June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====Travelling Doves of Peace====
Peace Mala released 14 small symbolic doves made from wood painted in the Peace Mala colours and each carrying a Peace Mala bracelet (along with other items) during a ceremony that took place in the Peace Mala peace garden on 30th April 2015. The Deputy Lord Mayor of the City and County of Swansea, the Mayor and Mayoress of Neath Port Talbot, Regional Chief of Police, Bishop Tom Burns of Menevia, representatives of several faith communities and pupils and teachers from some of Peace Mala Accredited schools were all in attendance.

The founder aims that as the Doves of Peace (also known as 'Peace Doves') travel the UK and across the world, they will raise awareness of the work of Peace Mala with schools, youth groups and community groups. Within the first few months after the launch, three of the doves travelled to the USA, Ireland, Holland, Italy, Cyprus, Israel, Africa, Hong Kong and Japan. The journeys of the 14 doves are being tracked to provide a geography project for schools and youth groups. This information is published on Facebook, Twitter and our interactive world maps for people to follow online.

[[File:Dove 13 in Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Dove 13 in Jerusalem]]

Each dove is being sponsored on its travels, thereby also bringing financial support and security for the future work of the Peace Mala educational charity. One doves in particular, number 13, is known as the Inter-Faith Dove of Peace. Information on how to sponsor the doves is available on the Peace Mala website.

===Festival of Interfaith and Culture for Education===
The Peace Mala Festival of Inter-Faith and Culture for Education was held at the award-winning, beautifully restored setting of The Monastery Manchester in Gorton on 4 October 2010.  The festival was organised by Laura Daniels, Head Teacher of Woodheys Primary School in Sale Greater Manchester, one of the first accredited schools in the UK.  Daniels came on board as an educational ambassador for Peace Mala in 2008.

The festival brought together Peace Mala with the Greater Manchester Authorities and representatives of local Faith and Peace groups to celebrate humanity, unity and diversity.  Messages of support came from the First Minister of the Welsh Assembly Government, the Archbishop of Wales and the former Bishop of Jerusalem and the Middle East.  Other support was shown by organisations including One World Week, The Interfaith Foundation, Spiritual England, Trafford CYPS and Redeeming Our Communities Manchester.

Many schools, cultural communities and representatives of faith communities took part. Guest of honour and main speaker was Terry Waite CBE.

===Recognising Achievement for Service to Wales===
On 10 June 2010 the founder of Peace Mala was honoured with the Recognising Achievement for Service to Wales.  This award was first introduced by the Welsh Assembly Government in 2009. The 2010 Award for Promoting Tolerance was carefully selected to mark the 65th anniversary of the end of World War II and the liberation of the death camps in Auschwitz and elsewhere. Evans received this honour from the First Minister Carwyn Jones AM in recognition of her work with Peace Mala and her positive stand against all forms of inequality and intolerance.

'''Peace Mala units at Primary and Secondary level included in the new Religious Education Agreed Syllabus for Trafford Education Authority UK'''

On Wednesday 9 February 2011, the founder was invited to take part in a full day of meetings with Trafford Education Authority to discuss the inclusion of Peace Mala units at primary and secondary level for the new RE Agreed Syllabus.  This proved highly successful with ideas being shared between teachers and RE advisors including Steve Illingworth (Independent Educational Consultant and Education Link Officer to Salford SACRE) and Erica Pounce, School Improvement Partner and Link Advisor for Primary Education. Pounce reported that they had worked as a Collaborative with other Greater Manchester SACREs but had also developed a distinctive local flavour, which is where the Peace Mala Units would sit as an optional unit and as an example of a compelling learning experience.
The New RE syllabus for Trafford Education Authority, including units on Peace Mala, was launched on 24 March 2011.

===International Interfaith Liturgy for World Peace, Llandaff 2017===
In July 2017 the Peace Mala International Interfaith Liturgy for World Peace took place at Llandaff Cathedral Wales. This major event took almost two years to organise and plan. The idea came to the founder after the Paris terrorist attacks on Friday 13 the November 2015. The founder felt urged to bring the Peace Mala community together and Llandaff Cathedral immediately sprang to mind as a venue for this. She also felt it was time to put the spotlight on the work being achieved by the children and young people in Peace Mala schools. The purpose would be to send out a message of love, friendship and peace to all people in our world. Representatives from sixteen religions, including three Christian Bishops, and supporters from across the UK and beyond attended and took part. These included dignitaries from Cardiff, Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Greater Manchester and Peace Mala schools from across Wales, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire. The cathedral was filled to capacity and turned out to be the largest interfaith gathering for world peace that Wales had hosted.

===Apostolic Blessing for Peace Mala from Pope Francis, September 2017===
On September 21st 2017, Peace Mala celebrated the UN International Day of Peace at St Joseph’s Catholic Cathedral in Swansea Wales UK. This was thanks to the invitation of Bishop Tom Burns of Menevia and the support of the Dean, Rev. Fr. Benedict Koledoye. Seven schools attended and took part in the Peace Mala Youth Liturgy for World Peace. Peace Mala linked up with One Day one Choir, a global peace initiative which uses the harmonious power of singing together to unite people around the world on Peace Day.

Peace Mala schools that could not be present at the event sang the Peace Mala Anthem, ‘One Light’ in their school assemblies across the UK. Lee Michael Walton, composer of the anthem, drove from London and back to accompany the children’s singing on St Joseph’s Cathedral organ. When it came to the final prayer and blessing from Bishop Tom, he susprised the congregation with an Apostolic Blessing from Pope Francis,

''"His Holiness Pope Francis presents his good wishes to Pam Evans and to all those persons involved in Peace Mala and imparts to them the requested Apostolic Blessing upon their work for world peace and encourages them with his prayers."''

This message and blessing which has a seal signed by the Apostolic Nuncio, is now on the office wall of Peace Mala HQ in Swansea.

===Youth Liturgy for World Peace, St David's Church Neath 2018===
On September 21st 2018 Peace Mala will be working with St David's Church in Neath to host a Youth Liturgy for World Peace on the UN International Day of Peace. Peace Mala accredited schools and those working towards accreditation will be joined by local dignitaries and 21 representatives from eleven different faiths.

'''Plymouth Marine Laboratory''' (abbreviated as '''PML''') in the city of [[Plymouth]], [[England]], is an independent collaborative centre of the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] (NERC). PML's Chairman is Admiral Sir [[James Burnell-Nugent]] and PML's Chief Executive is Prof. Stephen de Mora.

== Research and Capability ==
Research activity at PML broadly investigates global-scale issues of [[climate change]] and [[sustainability]]. PML's core capabilities are centred around [[biogeochemistry]] and [[systems science]], [[ecosystem health]] and [[human health]], and [[sustainable development]] and [[biodiversity]]. It has particular capacity around [[Earth observation]], [[ecosystem model|ecosystem modelling]], [[microbial ecology]], [[Colors_of_biotechnology#Blue_biotechnology|Blue biotechnology]], [[socioeconomics]] and [[science advice|policy advice]].

Specific research activities include the monitoring of [[ocean acidification|ocean acidity]] and its effects on [[coral]]s and [[shellfish]], and this information is reported to the UK government. As part of its research into sustainability, PML uses technology such as [[biochemical engineering|photo-bioreactors]] to cultivate [[algae]] that could be used in the production of [[biofuel]]s or in the treatment of waste water. Aside from its environmental research, PML also works alongside the [[Boots Group]] to investigate the use of algae in skin-care products, since these organisms utilise [[sunscreen]]-like compounds to protect themselves from the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwestrda.org.uk/what-we-do/business-growth/inward-investment/casestudy/viewCaseStudy.asp?id=25|title=The Plymouth Marine Laboratory|publisher=[[South West of England Regional Development Agency|South West England RDA]]|accessdate=2008-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within its Seawater Hall, PML contains an in-house, fully contained, algal scale-up pilot plant. This contains a 550L biofence photobioreactor and a 1200L [[raceway pond]] system, as well as a range of smaller [[bubble column reactor]] systems at 3.5L and 11L capacity for smaller scale algal production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamilton|first1=ML|last2=Warwick|first2=J|last3=Terry|first3=A|last4=Allen|first4=MJ|last5=Napier|first5=JA|last6=Sayanova|first6=O|title=Towards the Industrial Production of Omega-3 Long Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids from a Genetically Modified Diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum.|journal=PLoS ONE|date=14 December 2015|volume=10|issue=12|pages=e0144054|pmid=26658738|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0144054|pmc=4681182}}&lt;/ref&gt; These facilities are regularly used to generate dried algal biomass on the scale of grams to hundreds of grams. This algal innovation centre also investigates a range of downstream processing techniques for algal harvesting. In addition to large-scale investigations, PML also has a Single Cell Genomics facility: a dedicated clean room environment for single cell isolation, equipped with a high speed [[Atomic Force Microscope]], cell-sorting [[flow cytometry]] capabilities and a number of liquid-handling machines.

PML has a wholly owned trading subsidiary, PML Applications Ltd., which has been created to facilitate the exploitation and application of PML research and its products and to provide a more appropriate interface for working with end users, industrial and commercial partners.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

== History ==
The Plymouth Marine Laboratory was founded in 1988, mainly due to the recommendations of a House of Lords Report. It was formed by drawing some elements of the Laboratory of the [[Marine Biological Association]] (MBA) with the NERC [[Institute for Marine Environmental Research]] (IMER).

On 1 April 2002, PML changed from being a wholly owned NERC research centre to an independent organisation with [[Charitable organization|charitable]] status.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7504">The '''political science of religion''' (also referred to as politicology of religion or politology of religion) is one of the youngest disciplines in the [[political science]]s that deals with a study of influence that [[religion]] has on [[politics]] and vice versa with a focus on the relationship between the subjects ([[Actor (policy debate)|actors]]) in politics in the narrow sense: [[government]], [[political parties]], [[pressure group]]s, and [[religious communities]]. It was established in the last decades of the twentieth century.

==Research areas==
The basic research areas of the political science of religion are:
* All aspects of [[religion|religious]] teachings and practices that have direct political contents and messages, such as religious understanding of government, [[Power (sociology)|power]], political [[authority]], [[State (polity)|state]], political organizing, [[war]], [[peace]], etc.;
* All aspects of religious behavior and practice that don’t have direct political contents and messages but do have direct political consequences, such as building of [[Religious architecture|religious edifices]], [[pilgrimage]]s, etc.;
* Attitudes and positions of political subjects in the narrow sense towards religion and religious communities, such as that of [[political party|political parties]] and pressure groups towards religion and religious communities;
* Everything within apparently completely [[secular]] public behavior with no religious motives that causes religious consequences, such as an economic [[monopoly]] achieved by a religious group within a multi-confessional society – it cannot but cause political consequences.

These fields of research are in constant development. The newest area of research in political science of religion is on the subject of religion and international relations.

==History==
The political science of religion or politology of religion was established as an [[academic discipline]] in 1993 at the Faculty of Political Science of the [[University of Belgrade]], [[Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/eng/pages/p_id1/o_p.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210043816/http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/eng/pages/p_id1/o_p.html |archivedate=2010-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The  founder of this discipline is Dr Miroljub Jevtic; http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/en/undergraduate-studies/political-department/third-year/ . In 2006, [[Georgetown University]] established the [[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] as one of the first American university research centers devoted to issues surrounding the political science of religion.

The ''Politics and Religion Journal'' was founded by the Center for Study of Religion and Religious Tolerance in [[Belgrade, Serbia]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politicsandreligionjournal.com/english/english.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028171212/http://www.politicsandreligionjournal.com/english/english.htm |archivedate=2008-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its ''spiritus movens'' and [[editor in chief]] is [[Miroljub Jevtić]], professor at the Faculty of Political Science, University of Belgrade, Serbia. The journal ''Politics and Religion'', produced by Cambridge Journals, published its first volume in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayJournal?jid=RAP Politics and Religion]&lt;/ref&gt;

The political science of religion is studied at almost all universities and political science departments in the United States. The [[American Political Science Association]] has a religion and politics section.&lt;ref&gt;[https://connect.apsanet.org/s11/home/ “Religion and Politics”]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30355">‘Net positive’, from '''Positive Development''' (PD) theory, is a new paradigm in [[sustainable development]] and design.  PD theory (taught and published from 2003)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Birkeland, J. (2003) ‘Retrofitting: Beyond Zero Waste’, in ''KLM-UC International Conference Proceedings'', University of Canberra, ACT, Australia; Birkeland, J. (2004) ‘Building Assessment Systems: Reversing Environmental Impacts’, Nature and Society Forum, ACT, Australia, http://www.naf.org.au/naf-forum/birkeland (accessed 2005);  Birkeland, J. (2005) ‘Reversing Negative Impacts by Design’, in ''Sustainability for the ACT: the Future’s in our Hands'', Office of Sustainability, ACT, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; was first detailed in ''Positive Development'' (2008).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Birkeland, J. (2008) ''Positive Development: From Vicious Circles to Virtuous Cycles through Built Environment Design’'', Earthscan, London.  (A two volume book updating net positive theory is forthcoming.)&lt;/ref&gt; A net positive system/structure would ‘give back to nature and society more than it takes’ over its life cycle.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Eco-positive impacts of development must keep pace with human consumption (or ecological footprint) and offset past losses of nature, as defined in ''Positive Development'' ''(Ibid)'' p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, ‘sustainable development’ - in the real-world context of population growth, biodiversity losses, cumulative pollution, wealth disparities and social inequities - closes off future options.  To reverse direction, development must, among other sustainability criteria, increase nature beyond pre-human conditions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;A sustainable building should aim to be better for nature/society than no building at all, as well as increase nature beyond native conditions.  A rule of reason would be applied as to whether the baseline is pre-industrial or pre-historic, depending on the location and circumstances.&lt;/ref&gt; PD develops the tools to enable net positive design and development.

== Net Positive Sustainability ==
According to PD, the original precepts of sustainability (nature preservation and equity among current/future generations)&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;These principles are common to most early definitions of sustainability and were endorsed at a national level as early as 1969 in the preamble to the National Environmental Protection Act in the United States. Among the first international documents to define sustainability was the IUCN/UNEP/WWF (1980) ''World Conservation Strategy'', re-published in 1991 as ''Caring for the Earth: A Strategy for Sustainable Living'', The World Conservation Union, United Nations Environment Program and World Wide Fund for Nature, Earthscan, London, UK.  Here it meant improving life quality within the earth’s ecological carrying capacity. See also COAG (1992) The National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development (NSESD), Council of Australian Governments, Canberra, Australia.  For historical context, see Commoner, B. (1971) ''The Closing Circle: Nature, Man And Technology'', Knopf, New York and Porritt, J. (1985) ''Seeing Green: The Politics of Ecology Explained'', Blackwell Publishers, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; require increasing future options.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Social options do not mean more consumer products but rather substantive and positive life choices which requires increasing the ecological base and public estate.&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, requires that development increase the life support system (nature).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;The idea that sustainability requires maintaining or increasing future option was discussed in Birkeland, J. (1993) ''Planning for a Sustainable Society: Institutional Reform and Social Transformation'', University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania. See also Norton, B.G. (2005) ''Sustainability: A Philosophy of Adaptive Ecosystem Management'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois for a comprehensive discussion on this point.&lt;/ref&gt; Green design always aimed for ecological restoration, social regeneration and economic revitalization.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;For a typology of green building design, see Birkeland, J. (2013) ‘Business Opportunities through Positive Development’, in ''A New Dynamic: Effective Business in a Circular Economy'', in K. Webster, J. Bleriot, and C. Johnston (Eds), Ellen MacArthur Foundation Publishing, Isle of Wight, UK, pp. 87-110.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these essentially ‘add value’ relative to ''current'' sites, buildings or practices.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;For a discussion of contemporary sustainable building design approaches, see Hes, D. and du Plessus, D. (2015) ''Designing for Hope: Pathways to Regenerative Sustainability'', Taylor &amp; Francis, New York. USA.&lt;/ref&gt; They do not increase nature in absolute terms.  Positive development is defined as structures that increase universal life quality and future options by expanding the ‘ecological base’ (ecosystems, ecological carrying capacity, biodiversity) and the ‘public estate’ (universal access to means of survival/wellbeing and social capital).&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Birkeland, J. (2007) ‘GEN 4: ‘Positive Development’, ''BEDP (Built Environment Design Professions) Environmental Design Guide of the Australian Institute of Architects'', ACT, Australia. http://www.environmentdesignguide.com.au/ Assessed June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology Clarification ==
The term net positive&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;The term also appears as ‘net-positive’ or ‘netpositive’.  A special issue was dedicated to net-positive design.  See Cole, R. (2015) ‘Net-zero and Net-positive Design: a question of value’, in ''Building Research &amp; Information'' 43(1), pp. 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt; is increasingly used by green designers, developers and businesses.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;For example, see Forum for the Future, WWF, and The Climate Group (2015) ''Net Positive: A New Way of Doing Business''. Available at http://www.theclimategroup.org/what-we-do/publications/net-positive-a-new-way-of-doing-business/ Accessed June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in context, it usually means just ‘giving back’ - that is, without fixed baselines&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Benchmarks are relative to the present, so eco-restoration is seen by some as net positive, yet this does not account for past biodiversity losses and increased human consumption.&lt;/ref&gt; - by optimizing material resources, energy and stakeholder benefits, etc.  This was the aim of 20th Century green building design.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;There are a wide range of 20th Century green design books, including:  Papanek, V. (1971) ''Design for the Real World: human ecology and social change'', Pantheon Books, New York; Johnson, R. (1979) ''The Green City'', MacMillan: S. Melbourne, Australia;  Todd, N. and J. Todd (1994) ''From Eco-Cities to Living Machines'', N. Atlantic Books, Berkeley, CA.; Vale, B. and R. Vale (1975) ''The Autonomous House: Design and Planning for self-''sufficiency, Thames and Hudson Ltd, London;  Wann, D. (1996) ''Deep Design: Pathways to a Liveable Future'', Island Press, Washington, DC.;  Lyle, J.T. (1994) ''Regenerative Design for Sustainable Development'', Wiley &amp; Sons, New York;  van der Ryn, S, and Cowan, D. (1996)  ''Ecological Design'', Island Press, Washington, DC.  Mackenzie, D. (1991), ''Green Design: Design for the Environment'', Lawrence King, London;  Girardet, H. (1992), ''The Gaia Atlas of Cities: New Directions for Sustainable Urban Living'', Gaia books Ltd, London; and Yeang, K. (1999) ''The Green Skyscraper: The Basis for Designing Sustainable Intensive Buildings'', Prestel Verlag, Munich, Germany [Yeang has written numerous books on green design].&lt;/ref&gt; Although environmental ethics and social justice remain central concerns in PD,&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Social factors have always been a part of sustainable design paradigms, but the focus is generally on the (psychological, social, physiological, experiential, etc.) needs of building users, and less on using a building project to solve social inequities in the wider community.&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, ‘eco-positive’ is increasingly used to underscore the ecological dimension. The term ‘net’ also causes some confusion.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;See for example, Baggs, D. (2015) Buildings Alone will Never be Regenerative, in ''Sourceable - Industry News and Analysis'' https://sourceable.net/buildings-alone-will-never-be-regenerative/ June 29.  Accessed July 2015.  This claims net positive design only concerns resource balances and does not use a life cycle perspective, but this has no basis in PD literature.&lt;/ref&gt; In PD, ‘net’ means public benefits ''beyond'' neutral impacts - not just reducing the total negative impacts to zero by, for example, making tradeoffs.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;For an overview of zero energy building, see Kibert, C.J. and Fard, M.M. (2012) Differentiating among Low-energy, Low-carbon and Net Zero-energy Building Strategies for Policy Formulation, ''Building Research &amp; Information'', 40(5), pp. 625-637.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory Origins ==
PD theory built on eco-philosophies that emerged in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;See for example, Merchant, C. (1980) ''The Death of Nature: Women, ecology, and the scientific revolution'', HarperCollins, New York; Warren, K. (1997), ''Ecofeminism: Women, Culture, Nature'', Indiana University Press, Bloomington, Indiana;  Naess, A. (1989) ''Ecology, community, and lifestyle'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, UK; Warren, K. and Wells-Howe, B. (1994) ''Ecological Feminism'', Routledge, New York;  Salleh, A. (1997) ''Ecofeminism as Politics: Nature, Marx and the Postmodern'', Zed Books, London;  Shiva, V. (1988) ''Staying Alive: Women, Ecology and Development'', Zed Books, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Calling for social transformation, they deconstructed the hierarchical cultures, dualistic thought patterns and linear-reductionist analyses of modernity. PD added a positive/negative overlay to explain why these theories did not contemplate increasing nature to offset consumption. Later, sustainability was absorbed into the dominant paradigm (DP) which assumed that current institutions could resolve the problems they fostered.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;See WCED (1987) ''Our Common Future'', Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK.  This seminal report couched sustainability within the dominant economic and policy making frameworks and did not engage with the sustainability literature critical of the dominant paradigm.&lt;/ref&gt; According to PD, existing institutional and physical structures reduce future options and are thus terminal.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;''Planning for Sustainability, Ibid.'' Birkeland, J. (2008) ''Positive Development, Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis was that, by converting negative systems into positive ones, genuinely sustainable planning, decision and design frameworks would materialize.

=== Design-decision Distinction ===
The distinction between decision-making and design is central to PD.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;See Birkeland, J. (2012) ‘Design blindness in Sustainable Development: From Closed to Open Systems Design Thinking’, in ''The Journal of Urban Design'', 17(2), pp. 163-187.&lt;/ref&gt; Decision-making processes/tools divide, compare and choose.  They use bounded or ‘closed system’ thinking which excludes considerations that are difficult to quantify.  Essentially, decision methods simplify issues and options to facilitate finding the best path from the present position or desired future.  Back-casting and scenario planning, while powerful tools, presume the future can be predicted and selected.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;''Positive Development, Ibid,'' pp. 165-179&lt;/ref&gt; Such methods decide now how future citizens must live.  They also reduce future options by narrowing resources, adaptability, space and biodiversity over time. Sustainability therefore requires rethinking decision-making and design tools from first principles.

=== Decision-making (reducing costs) ===
The reduction of the ecological base and public estate continues, PD argues, because new sustainability goals were spliced onto the old (anti-ecological) closed system models, methods and metrics of the DP.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;''Positive Development, Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; Given escalating human consumption, even global depopulation and ecological regeneration would not counterbalance total negative resource flows and ecological impacts. PD maintains that closed system models created and institutionalized zero-sum decision and measurement frameworks such as cost-benefit/risk-benefit analyses.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;''Positive Development, Ibid,'' pp. 117-130.&lt;/ref&gt; It identifies and ‘reverses’ over a hundred systemic biases in governance, planning, decision and design frameworks by converting them into open system and design-based frameworks to facilitate eco-positive planning and design.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;Birkeland, J. (2014) ‘Positive Development and Assessment’, in ''Smart and Sustainable Built Environments'', 3(1), pp. 4-22;  Birkeland, J. (2015) ‘Planning for Positive Development’, in J. Byrne, J. Dodson and N. Sipe (Eds), ''Australian Environmental Planning: Challenges and Future Prospects'', Routledge, pp. 246-257.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design (multiplying benefits) ===
Whereas the internal logic of decision frameworks (choosing) tend to diminish ecosystems and land eco-productivity, eco-logical design (creating) can multiply functions and public benefits synergistically. Eco-positive design involves open systems thinking (i.e. with transparent/permeable boundaries).  For example, building rating tools are based on limits or thresholds (borders) and do not contemplate net public gains.  Perhaps because of the deeply-embedded historic elevation of rationalist decision-making over design, green building design templates and rating tools are decision-based.  Being reductionist, they encourage tradeoffs between costs and benefits or nature and society in physical development.  Hence they tend to reduce adaptability, diversity and reversibility.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;There are many critiques of green building rating tools.  Brandon, P.S., and Lombardi, P.L. (2011) ''Evaluating Sustainable Development in the Built Environment'' (2nd ed.) Chichester, West Sussex, Ames, Iowa, Wiley-Blackwell; Gu, Z., Wennersten, R., and Assefa, G. (2006) ‘Analysis of the Most Widely Used Building Environmental Assessment Methods’, ''Environmental Sciences,'' 3(3), pp. 175-192;  Birkeland, J. (2004) ‘Building Assessment Systems: Reversing Environmental Impacts’, Nature and Society Forum, ACT, [[Australia http://www.naf.org.au/naf-forum/birkeland|Australia &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.naf.org.au/naf-forum/birkeland&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] (accessed 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
Decision systems in governance (i.e. legislative, executive and judicial) resolve conflict by allocating rights and resources - not by increasing the ecological base and/or public estate.  Hence PD suggests different frameworks for environmental governance.&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;Birkeland, J. (1996) ‘The Case for a New Public Forum’, in Furnass, B., Whyte, J., Harris, J., and Baker, A. (Eds), ''Survival, Health and Wellbeing into the 21st Century'', Nature and Society Forum, pp. 111-114.  Birkeland, J. (1995) ‘Ethics-Based Planning’, ''Australian Planner'' 33(1), pp. 47-49.&lt;/ref&gt; These include a modified constitution with a new decision sphere to deal with the unique ethical dimensions of biophysical development, planning and design.&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;Birkeland, J. (1993) ‘Towards a New System of Environmental Governance’, in ''The Environmentalist'', 13(1), pp. 19-32;  Birkeland, J. (1993) ''Planning for a Sustainable Society, Ibid''; Birkeland, J. (2008) ''Positive Development, Ibid,'' pp. 220-233.&lt;/ref&gt; Given real-world political barriers to change, PD also suggests default strategies to enable incremental reform by changing institutions from within.  PD contends that gaps can be avoided in new governance and planning systems by simply reversing each ecologically terminal convention into eco-positive ones.

== Planning ==
SMARTmode (systems mapping and redesign thinking) is a PD planning process&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;''Positive Development, Ibid,'' pp. 251-173.&lt;/ref&gt; that includes two dozen environment gap analyses to highlight sustainability issues that are almost never assessed in planning or design.&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2015) ‘Planning for Positive Development’, in J. Byrne, J. Dodson and N. Sipe (Eds), ''Australian Environmental Planning: Challenges and Future Prospects'', Routledge, pp. 246-257.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these are forensic ‘flows analyses’ that identify (local/regional) social and ecological deficits that developments could ameliorate by design.  They can be undertaken scientifically using emerging multi-dimensional digital mapping tools,&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, D. and Simpson, R., eds. (2012) ''D_City: Digital Earth, Virtual Nations, Data Cities'', D_City, Sydney, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; more pragmatically by design teams,&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (1996) ‘Improving the Design Review Process’, ''CIB Commission Conference Proceedings'', RMIT, Melbourne, pp. 150-155;  Birkeland, J. (2014) ‘Systems and Social Change for Sustainable and Resilient Cities’, L. Pearson, P. Newton and P. Roberts (Eds), ''Resilient Sustainable Cities'', Routledge, UK, pp. 66-82.&lt;/ref&gt; or more subjectively in community ‘charrettes’ (aka working bees) for workshopping planning criteria and design briefs.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkissian, W. (2002) ‘Pros and cons of design charrettes’, in J. Birkeland (Ed) ''Design for Sustainability: A Sourcebook of Integrated Eco-logical Solutions'', Earthscan, London, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Until planners perform these analyses routinely, therefore, they can serve as design thinking exercises, guidelines and/or criteria.

== Design ==
While improved systems of governance, decision-making and planning can assist, biophysical sustainability is ultimately a design problem. To compensate for past system design errors, fundamental reforms of design methods and processes are required.  PD proposes means to reduce material flows without tradeoffs by, for example, creating mutual gains and ‘low-impact luxury’ environments.&lt;ref&gt;Aesthetics or design quality does not equal high production costs, whereas high-tech equipment usually has high [[embodied energy]].&lt;/ref&gt; PD contends that eco-positive design is already possible, partly through the integration of natural systems with building structures, spaces and surfaces (e.g. ‘[[living machines]]’,&lt;ref&gt;Todd, N.J. and Todd J. (1994) ''From Eco-Cities to Living Machines'', Atlantic Books, Berkeley, California;  J. Todd (2002) ‘Living Technologies’, in Birkeland J. (Ed) ''Design for Sustainability: A sourcebook of Integrated Eco-logical Solutions'', Earthscan, London, pp. 114-117.&lt;/ref&gt; [[mycology]],&lt;ref&gt;Stamets, P. (2005) ''Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World'', Ten Speed Press, Berkeley, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; ‘algaetecture’&lt;ref&gt;Algae Industry Magazine (2011), Algaeindustry.com. Accessed August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;). PD contributes other design concepts (e.g. ‘design for eco-services’,&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2009) ‘Design for Eco-services’, Part A - Environmental Services, ''Environment Design Guide 77'', and Part B - Building Services, ''Environmental Design Guide 78'', Canberra, Architects Institute of Australia, Canberra, Architects Institute of Australia, pp. 1-13 and pp. 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt; ‘green scaffolding’&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2014) ‘Resilient and Sustainable Buildings’, Pearson, L., Newton P., and Roberts P. (Eds), ''Resilient Sustainable Cities'', Routledge, UK, pp. 146-159.&lt;/ref&gt; ‘green space walls’,&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2008) ‘Space Frame Walls: Facilitating Positive Development’, in ''Proceedings of the 2008 World Sustainable Building Conference''. Melbourne, Australia, September 22–25.  See also www.sustainability.org.au.&lt;/ref&gt; ‘solar core’ and ‘piggyback roof,&lt;ref&gt;Paten C., Birkeland, J. and Pears A. (2005) ‘Greening the Built Environment’, in Hargroves, C. and Smith, M.H. (Eds) ''The Natural Advantage of Nations'', London, Earthscan, pp. 367-8&lt;/ref&gt; ‘playgardens’&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2002) Playgardens and Community in ''Design for Sustainability; a Sourcebook of Eco-logical Solutions,'' Earthscan, London, pp. 109-112;  Birkeland, J. (1994) ‘Ecofeminist Playgardens’, International Play Journal, Vol. 2, pp. 49-59.&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Design for Eco-services ===
The term ‘ecosystem services’ generally applies only to human benefits, which are usually valued by units (e.g. money, carbon or energy.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R. et al. (1997) ‘The Value of the World’sEcosystem Services and Natural Capital’, ''Nature'', vol 387, pp. 253–260;  Heal, G. (2000) ''Nature and the Marketplace: Capturing the Value of Ecosystem Services'', Island Press, Washington, DC; Folke, C. Jansson, Å., Larsson, J. and Costanza, R. (1997) ‘Ecosystem Appropriation by Cities, Ambio Vol 26, pp. 167-172;  Daily, G. and K. Ellison (2002) ''The New Economy of Nature'', Island Press, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; PD uses the term ‘eco-services’ to include not only nature’s instrumental (pragmatic) values like ecosystem goods and services, but its intrinsic (priceless) and ‘biophilic’ values.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E.O. (1993) ''The Biophilia Hypothesis'', in S. Kellert (Ed) Island Press, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; PD considers the value of nature to be ‘infinite’ as it is not only the basis of the economy, but essential to human existence itself.  To counteract the ecological footprint of existing development,&lt;ref&gt;Wackernagel, M. and Rees W. E. (1996) ''Our Ecological Footprint: Reducing the Human Impact on the Earth'', New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt; ‘surplus’ natural and social capital&lt;ref&gt;Surplus in PD means ‘giving back more than it takes’ from a life cycle and whole system perspective, not sending energy or water back to the grid or mains.&lt;/ref&gt; - assessed from fixed biophysical baselines - must be created both off-site and on-site by design.

=== Carbon-neutral Design ===
Net positive energy is barred by the laws of physics.  Moreover, calculations of ‘net energy’ seldom include the embodied energy - let alone ecological impacts incurred during resource extraction, production and transportation.  With substantial passive solar design and renewable energy, buildings can send unused energy back to the grid, but it might be used for unsustainable purposes elsewhere. Nonetheless, a building could sequester more carbon than it emits over its life cycle with substantial building-integrated vegetation, using PD design principles.  A case study (conducted by a cross-disciplinary team) showed this would within under twelve years, well under its life span.&lt;ref&gt;Renger, C., Birkeland, J. and Midmore, D. (2015) ‘Net Positive Building Carbon Sequestration: A Case Study in Brisbane’, in ''Building Research and Information: Special issue'' on net positive design 43(1), pp. 11-24. See also Birkeland, J.L. (2008) ‘Space Frame Walls: Facilitating Positive Development’, in ''Proceedings of the 2008 World Sustainable Building Conference''. Melbourne, Australia, September 22–25, http://trove.nla.gov.au/ accessed June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design Reporting ===
The PD eco-positive design reporting process (EDR)&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (1996) ‘Improving the Design Review Process’, ''CIB Commission Conference Proceedings'', RMIT, Melbourne, pp. 150-155;  Birkeland, J. (2014) ‘Systems and Social Change for Sustainable and resilient Cities’, L. Pearson, P. Newton and P. Roberts (Eds), ''Resilient Sustainable Cities'', Routledge, UK, pp. 66-82.&lt;/ref&gt; aims to avoid many shortcomings of decision-based approaches to design.&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2008) ''Positive Development'', ''Ibid,'' pp. 83-96. Rating tools often give credits for things that have financial gains like energy and water savings or worker health and productivity but do not increase the ecology, let alone offset biodiversity impacts. They do not credit actual net positive impacts.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to green building rating tools, the EDR aims to uncover opportunities to create net public gains.  Design teams answer questions based on PD design criteria&lt;ref&gt;''Positive Development'', ''Ibid,'' pp. 257-258.&lt;/ref&gt; and SMARTmode analyses.&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2015) ‘Planning for Positive Development’, in J. Byrne, J. Dodson and N. Sipe (Eds), ''Australian Environmental Planning: Challenges and Future Prospects'', Routledge, pp. 246-257;  ''Positive Development'', ''Ibid,'' pp. 251-273.&lt;/ref&gt; This forces education, collaboration and ‘frontloading’ design (i.e. investing more in preliminary design stages).&lt;ref&gt;See Weizacker, E. van, Lovins, A. and Lovins, H. (1997) ''Factor 4: Doubling Wealth – Halving Resource Use'', Earthscan, London, UK.  Hawken, P., Lovins, A and Lovins, H. (1999) ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution'', Earthscan, London, UK.  It is a widely cited claim that design is only about one percent of the total cost of the building, yet can save fifty to ninety percent of the total operating cost of a building.&lt;/ref&gt; Exposing the research and reasoning behind decision and design concepts facilitates input from community, assessors and independent experts, and should therefore occur be undertaken in development project. Being affordable and flexible, it is also easily adapted to developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;An example EDR process was created for Bogota based on a study of cultural, economic, social, ecological and other special needs.  This is not yet published.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design Strategies ===
Eco-positive retrofitting is a priority PD strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2009) ‘Eco-Retrofitting with Building Integrated Living’, in ''Smart and Sustainable Built Environment Conference Proceedings''. Delft, Netherlands. www.sasbe2009.com/ accessed May 2011; ''Positive Development'', ''Ibid,'' pp. 23-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the massive ongoing impacts of buildings, biophysical sustainability is impossible without retrofitting cities.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP (2013) ''Buildings and Climate Change: Summary for Decision Makers'', United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Nairobi (by United Nations organizations and national building institutes).  UN-HABITAT (2011) ''Cities and Climate Change: Global Report on Human Settlements''. http://www.unhabitat.org/downloads/docs/GRHS2011_Full.pdf/ accessed July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Replacing buildings with greener ones costs too much in materials, money, energy and time, as new buildings represent only 1-3% of the building stock.  It is now accepted that retrofitting can be profitable in resource, energy, health savings and worker productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Romm, J. (1999) ''Cool Companies: How the Best Businesses Boost Profits and Productivity by Cutting Greenhouse Emissions'', Island Press, Washington, DC.;  EPA (1998) Market Values for Home Energy Efficiency (study by Nevin and Watson for the USA Environmental Protection Agency), Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; It can happen quickly and simultaneously, or when buildings are repurposed or refurbished anyway.  Green buildings may last a hundred years but few are designed for upgrading/adaptability, so they will soon need retrofitting to a higher standard.

== Design Assessment ==
Most rating tools prioritize resource efficiency and treat ‘reductions in negative impacts’ as if positive.  Their baselines and benchmarks preclude net-positive impacts.  Some provisions consider respective rights/responsibilities, but not broader ethical issues like improving human-nature relationships, reducing total resource flows or increasing social capital in the vicinity. Also, innovation is often valued for its own sake, not outcomes, and eco-efficiency saves owners money anyway. PD’s ‘hierarchy of eco-innovation’ analysis instead prioritizes positive system-wide outcomes and net public benefits.&lt;ref&gt;The PD ‘hierarchy of eco-innovation’ is summarized in Birkeland, J. (2008) ''Positive Development'', ''Ibid,'' pp. 240-242.&lt;/ref&gt; Being non-numerical, it allows self-assessment during design when scientific data is unavailable, time and ego has vested or irreversible decisions are made.

=== PD Starfish ===
The PD ‘starfish’ design and rating tool enables quantification while assisting designers to consider more dimensions of sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2010) ‘Starfish Tool for Net Positive Design’, Presentation at ''Positive Communities'', DEEDI (Queensland Government), Brisbane;  Birkeland, J. (2012) ‘Design blindness in Sustainable Development: From Closed to Open Systems Design Thinking’, in ''The Journal of Urban Design'', 17(2), 163-187. (Note the tool is elaborated in a forthcoming book).&lt;/ref&gt; It is a modified radar diagram with added layers and satellite diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;Radar diagrams are standard spreadsheet tools.&lt;/ref&gt; Since most life cycle assessment tools estimate impacts between ‘-1’ (bad) to ‘0’ (best) or zero impact, eco-positive public benefits are excluded.  Unlike rating tools, benchmarks for different sustainability factors are based on fixed biophysical conditions - not typical buildings, sites or practices.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, D and R. Simpson (2012) ''D_City: Digital Earth/Virtual Nations/Data Cities - Connecting Global Futures for Environmental Planning'', D. Jackson and R. Simpson, E-book, http://dcitynetwork.net/manifesto/; Birkeland, J. (2012) ‘The Eco-Positive Design Tool’, in ''Solar Progress'', Journal of the Australian Solar Energy Society.&lt;/ref&gt; The starfish uses one scale to assess impacts in relation to fixed benchmarks (from ‘-1’ to ‘+1’) and a linear scale on another layer for scoring/comparison purposes.

'''Professional certification''', '''trade certification''', or '''professional designation''', often called simply ''certification'' or ''qualification'', is a designation earned by a person to assure qualification to perform a job or task. Not all certifications that use [[post-nominal letters]] are an acknowledgement of educational achievement, or an agency appointed to safeguard the public interest.

==Overview==
A certification is a third-party attestation of an individual's level of knowledge or proficiency in a certain industry or profession. They are granted by authorities in the field, such as [[professional society|professional societies]] and universities, or by private certificate-granting agencies. Most certifications are time-limited; some expire after a period of time (e.g., the lifetime of a product that required certification for use), while others can be renewed indefinitely as long as certain requirements are met. Renewal usually requires ongoing education to remain up-to-date on advancements in the field, evidenced by earning the specified number of [[continuing education]] credits (CECs), or [[continuing education unit]]s (CEUs), from approved professional development courses.

Many certification programs are affiliated with professional associations, trade organizations, or private vendors interested in raising industry standards. Certificate programs are often created or endorsed by professional associations, but are typically completely independent from membership organizations. Certifications are very common in fields such as aviation, construction, technology, environment, and other industrial sectors, as well as healthcare, business, real estate, and finance.
 
According to ''The Guide to National Professional Certification Programs'' (1997) by Phillip Barnhart, "certifications are portable, since they do not depend on one company's definition of a certain job" and they provide protential employers with "an impartial, third-party endorsement of an individual's professional knowledge and experience".&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Barnhart, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3tY8Fck5UVkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=the%20guide%20to%20national%20professional%20certification%20programs&amp;pg=PA2 The Guide to National Professional Certification Programs] (1997), HRD Press. {{ISBN|0-8493-9960-2}} Retrieved electronically 7 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certification is different from professional licensure. In the United States, licenses are typically issued by state agencies, whereas certifications are usually awarded by professional societies or educational institutes. Obtaining a certificate is voluntary in some fields, but in others, certification from a government-accredited agency may be legally required to perform certain jobs or tasks. In other countries, licenses are typically granted by professional societies or universities and require a certificate after about three to five years and so on thereafter. The assessment process for certification may be more comprehensive than that of licensure, though sometimes the assessment process is very similar or even the same, despite differing in terms of legal status.

The [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) defines the standard for being a certifying agency as meeting the following two requirements:
# Delivering an assessment based on industry knowledge that is independent from training courses or course providers
# Granting a time-limited credential to anyone who meets the assessment standards

The [[Institute for Credentialing Excellence]] (ICE) is a U.S.-based organization that sets standards for the accreditation of personnel certification and certificate programs based on the ''[[Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing]]'', a joint publication of the American Educational Research Association (AERA), the American Psychological Association (APA), and the National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME). Many members of the [[Association of Test Publishers]] (ATP) are also certification organizations.

==Types of certifications==
There are three general types of certification. Listed in order of development level and portability, they are: corporate (internal), product-specific, and profession-wide.

Corporate, or "internal" certifications, are made by a [[corporation]] or low-stakes organization for internal purposes. For example, a corporation might require a one-day training course for all sales personnel, after which they receive a certificate. While this certificate has limited portability – to other corporations, for example – it is the most simple to develop.

Product-specific certifications are more involved, and are intended to be referenced to a product across all applications. This approach is very prevalent in the [[information technology]] (IT) industry, where personnel are certified on a version of [[software]] or hardware. This type of certification is portable across locations (for example, different corporations that use that software), but not across other products. Another example could be the certifications issued for shipping personnel, which are under international standards even for the recognition of the certification body, under the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO).

The most general type of certification is profession-wide. Certification in the medical profession is often offered by particular specialties. In order to apply professional standards, increase the level of practice, and protect the public, a professional organization might establish a certification. This is intended to be portable to all places a certified professional might work. Of course, this generalization increases the cost of such a program; the process to establish a legally defensible assessment of an entire profession is very extensive. An example of this is a [[Certified Public Accountant]]&amp;nbsp;(CPA), which would not be certified for just one corporation or one piece of [[accountancy]] software but for general work in the profession.

==Professional certificates awarded by universities==
Many universities grant professional certificates as an award for the completion of an educational program. The curriculum of a professional certificate is most often in a focused subject matter. Many professional certificates have the same curriculum as master's degrees in the same subject. Many other professional certificates offer the same courses as master's degrees in the same subject, but require the student to take fewer total courses to complete the program. Some professional certificates have a curriculum that more closely resembles a baccalaureate major in the same field.  The typical professional certificate program is between 200–300 class-hours in size. It is uncommon for a program to be larger or smaller than that. Most professional certificate programs are open enrollment, but some have admissions processes. A few universities put some of their professional certificates into a subclass they refer to as advanced professional certificates.

Some of the more commonly offered professional certificates include:
* Professional Certificate in Accounting (PCA)
* Professional Certificate in Contract Management (PCCM)
* Professional Certificate in Customer Relationship Management (PCCRM)
* Professional Certificate in Facility Management (PCFM)
* Professional Certificate in Financial Planning (PCFP)
* Professional Certificate in Graphic Design (PCGD)
* Professional Certificate in Human Resources (PCHR)
* Professional Certificate in Marketing (PCM)
* Professional Certificate in Paralegal Studies (PCPS)
* Professional Certificate in Project Management (PCPM)
* Professional Certificate in Supply Chain Management (PCSCM)
* Professional Certificate in Store Management (PCSM)
* Professional Certificate in Materials Management (PCMM)
* Professional Certificate in Technical Communication (PCTC)

===Advanced professional certificate===
''Advanced professional certificates'' are professional credentials designed to help [[professional]]s enhance their [[job performance]] and marketability in their respective fields. In many other countries, certificates are qualifications in [[higher education]]. In the [[United States]], a certificate may be offered by an institute of higher education. These certificates usually signify that a student has reached a standard of knowledge of a certain [[vocation]]al subject. Certificate programs can be completed more quickly than associate degrees and often do not have general education requirements.

An advanced professional certificate is a result of an educational process designed for individuals. Certificates are designed for both newcomers to the industry as well as seasoned professionals. Certificates are awarded by an [[educational program]] or [[academic institution]]. Completion of a certificate program indicates completion of a course or series of courses with a specific concentration that is different from an educational degree program. Course content for an advanced certificate is set forth through a variety of sources i.e. [[faculty (academic staff)|faculty]], [[committee]], [[Teacher|instructors]], and other subject matter experts in a related field. The end goal of an advanced professional certificate is so that professionals may demonstrate knowledge of course content at the end of a set period in time.

Institutions that offer advance professional certificates in various fields and industries include:

==Areas of certification==

===Accountancy, auditing and finance===
There are many professional bodies for accountants and auditors throughout the world; some of them are legally recognized in their jurisdictions.
[[Public accounting|Public accountants]] are the [[accountancy]] and [[Management accounting|control]] experts that are legally certified in different [[jurisdiction]]s to work in public practices, certifying accounts as [[statutory auditor]]s, eventually selling advice and services to other individuals and businesses. Today, however, many work within private corporations, financial industry, and government bodies.

===Aviation===
[[Aviators]] are certified through theoretical and in-flight examinations. Requirements for certifications are quite equal in most countries and are regulated by each National Aviation Authority. The existing certificates or pilot licenses are:
* SPL (Sport Pilot License)conferred by the FAA ([[Federal Aviation Administration]])
* [[Private Pilot License|PPL]] (Private Pilot License) conferred by the FAA ([[Federal Aviation Administration]]) or JAA ([[Joint Aviation Authorities]])
* CPL ([[Commercial Pilot Licence]]) conferred by the FAA ([[Federal Aviation Administration]]) or JAA ([[Joint Aviation Authorities]])
* ATP ([[Airline Transport Pilot License|Airline Transport Pilot]]) conferred by the FAA ([[Federal Aviation Administration]]) or JAA ([[Joint Aviation Authorities]])

Licensing in these categories require not only examinations but also a minimum number of flight hours. All categories are available for Fixed-Wing Aircraft ([[airplane]]s) and Rotatory-Wing Aircraft ([[helicopter]]s). Within each category, aviators may also obtain certifications in:
* Instrument Flight Rules ([[Instrument flight rules|IFR]])
* [[:Category:Multi-engine aircraft|Multi-engine aircraft]]
* [[Turbojet]] Engines
* [[Jet Engine]]s
* [[Experimental aircraft]]
* [[Amphibious aircraft]]
* [[Seaplane]]s
Usually, aviators must be certified also in their log books for the type and model of aircraft they are allowed to fly. Currency checks as well as regular medical check-ups with a frequency of 6 months, 12 months, or 36 months, depending on the type of flying permitted, are obligatory. An aviator can fly only if holding:
* A valid pilot license
* A valid medical certificate
* Valid certifications for the type of aircraft and type of flight.

In [[Europe]], the [[Air Navigation Service Provider|ANSP]], [[Air traffic controller|ATCO]] &amp; ANSP technicians are certified according to [[EUROCONTROL Safety Regulatory Requirement|ESARRs]] [https://archive.is/20121203024613/http://www.eurocontrol.int/src/public/standard_page/src_deliverables.html] (according to [[European Union|EU]] regulation 2096/2005 "Common Requirements").

===Warehousing management===
A warehouse management system (WMS) is a part of the supply chain and primarily aims to control the movement and storage of materials within a warehouse and process the associated transactions, including shipping, receiving, putaway and picking. The systems also direct and optimize stock putaway based on real-time information about the status of bin utilization. A WMS monitors the progress of products through the warehouse. It involves the physical warehouse infrastructure, tracking systems, and communication between product stations.

More precisely, warehouse management involves the receipt, storage and movement of goods, (normally finished goods), to intermediate storage locations or to a final customer. In the multi-echelon model for distribution, there may be multiple levels of warehouses. This includes a central warehouse, a regional warehouses (serviced by the central warehouse) and potentially retail warehouses (serviced by the regional warehouses).{{cn|date=February 2018}}

This system provides the assurance that equipment is manufactured to meet safety standards, and that services such as installation, repair and overhaul also comply with IEC International Standards on safety. The United Nations, via UNECE (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe), recommends the IEC and IECEx as the world’s best practice model for the verification of conformity to International Standards. It published a “Common Regulatory Framework” encompassing the use of IEC International Standards developed by IEC TC (Technical Committee) 31: Equipment for explosive atmospheres, with proof of compliance demonstrated by IECEx.

===Language education===
[[English language learning and teaching|TESOL]] is a large field of employment with widely varying degrees of regulation. Most provision worldwide is through the [[state school]] system of each individual country, and as such, the instructors tend to be trained primary- or [[secondary school]] teachers who are [[native speakers]] of the language of their pupils, and not of English. Though native speakers of English have been working in non-English speaking countries [[TEFL|in this capacity]] for years, it was not until the last twenty-five years or so that there was any widespread focus on training particularly for this field. Previously, workers in this sort of job were anyone from [[backpacking (travel)|backpackers]] hoping to earn some extra travel money to well-educated professionals in other fields doing [[Volunteering|volunteer]] work, or retired people. These sort of people are certainly still to be found, but there are many who consider TESOL their main profession.

One of the problems{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} facing these full-time teachers is the absence of an international governing body for the certification or licensure of English language teachers. However, [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] and its subsidiary body [[UCLES]] are pioneers in trying to get some degree of accountability and quality control to consumers of English courses, through their [[CELTA]] and [[DELTA (ELT)|DELTA]] programs. [[Trinity College London]] has equivalent programs, the [[CertTESOL]] and the [[LTCL DipTESOL]]. They offer initial certificates in teaching, in which candidates are trained in [[language]] awareness and [[classroom]] techniques, and given a chance to practice teaching, after which feedback is reported. Both institutions have as a follow-up a professional diploma, usually taken after a year or two in the field. Although the initial certificate is available to anyone with a high school education, the diploma is meant to be a post-graduate qualification and in fact can be incorporated into a master's degree program.

===Legal affairs===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}An increasing number of attorneys are choosing to be recognized as having special expertise in certain fields of law. According to the [[American Bar Association]], a lawyer who is a certified specialist has been recognized by an independent professional certifying organization as having an enhanced level of skill and expertise, as well as substantial involvement in an established legal specialty. These organizations require a lawyer to demonstrate special training, experience and knowledge to ensure that the lawyer's recognition is meaningful and reliable. Lawyer conduct with regard to specialty certification is regulated by the states.

===Logistics and transport===
[[Logistician]] is the profession in the logistics and transport sectors, including sea, air, land and rail modes. Professional qualification for logisticians usually carries post-nominal letters. 

Certification granting bodies include, but are not limited to, [[APICS|Association for Operations Management]] (APICS), [[Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport]] (CILT), [[International Society of Logistics]] (SOLE), [[Canadian Institute of Traffic and Transportation]] (CITT), and [[Allied Council for Commerce and Logistics]] (ACCL).

===Marketing===
* CME (Certified Marketing Executive), conferred by [[Sales &amp; Marketing Executives International|Sales &amp; Marketing Executives International, Inc.]].

===Ministers===
Churches have their own process of who may use various religious titles. [[Protestant]] churches typically require a [[Masters of Divinity]], accreditation by the [[Christian denomination|denomination]] and [[ordination]] by the local church in order for a minister to become a "[[Reverend]]". Those qualifications may or may not also give government authorization to solemnize [[marriage]]s

===Medicine===
{{Main article|Medical credentials}}
[[Board certification]] is the process by which a physician in the United States documents by written, practical or computer based testing, illustrating a mastery of knowledge and skills that define a particular area of medical specialization. The [[American Board of Medical Specialties]], a not-for-profit organization, assists 24 approved medical specialty boards in the development and use of standards in the ongoing evaluation and certification of physicians.

Medical specialty certification in the United States is a voluntary process. While medical licensure sets the minimum competency requirements to diagnose and treat patients, it is not specialty specific.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abms.org/about_board_certification/means.aspx What Board Certification Means]. Abms.org. Retrieved on 5 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Board certification demonstrates a physician’s exceptional expertise in a particular specialty or sub-specialty of medical practice.

Patients, physicians, health care providers, insurers and quality organizations regard certification as an important measure of a physician’s knowledge, experience and skills to provide quality health care within a given specialty.

Other professional certifications include certifications such as [[medical license]]s, [[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians]], Fellowship of the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada]], [[nursing board certification]], diplomas in [[social work]]. The [[Commission for Certification in Geriatric Pharmacy]] certifies pharmacists that are knowledgeable about principles of geriatric pharmacotherapy and the provision of pharmaceutical care to the elderly. Additional certifying bodies relating to the medical field include:
* [[Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists]]
* [[American College of Emergency Physicians]]
* [[Royal Australasian College of Physicians]]
* [[Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons]]
* [[Membership of the College of Emergency Medicine]]

===Peer support===
NCPRP stands for “National Certified Peer Recovery Professional”, and the NCPRP credential and exam were developed in collaboration with the International Certification Board of Recovery Professionals (ICBRP) and is currently being administered by [[PARfessionals]].

PARfessionals is a professional organization and all of the available courses are professional development and pre-certification courses.

The NCPRP credential and exam focus primarily on the concept of [[Peer support|peer recovery]] through mental health and addiction recovery. It has the main purpose of training student-candidates on how to become [[Peer support specialist|peer recovery professionals]] who can provide guidance, knowledge or assistance for individuals who have had similar experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PARfessionals, LLC|url=http://parfessionals.org|access-date=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each student-candidate must complete several key steps which include initial registration; the pre-certification review course; and all applicable sections of the official application in order to become eligible to complete the final step, which is the NCPRP certification exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student-Candidate Registration|url=https://www.onlineregistrationcenter.com/parfessionals|publisher=PARfessionals, LLC|access-date=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCPRP credential is obtained once a participant successfully passes the NCPRP certification exam by the second attempt and is valid for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=NCPRP Candidate Handbook|date=2014|publisher=PARfessionals, LLC|page=51|access-date=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Political commentators have criticized professional or [[occupational licensing]], especially medical and legal licensing, for restricting the supply of services and therefore making them more expensive, often putting them out of reach of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/18/business/for-law-schools-a-price-to-play-the-abas-way.html?_r=2&amp;sq=law%20the%20a.b.a.%20way&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=David | last=Segal | title=For Law Schools, a Price to Play the A.B.A.'s Way | date=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason.com/blog/2010/09/17/professional-licensing-watch-l Professional Licensing Watch, Liberal Division – Hit &amp; Run]. Reason.com (2010-09-17). Retrieved on 2013-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proliferation of IT certifications (both offered and attained) has led some technologists to question their value. Proprietary content that has been distributed on the Internet allows some to gain credentials without the implied depth or breadth of expertise.

{{About|the recorder as an introduction to learning music|the recorder as a musical instrument|Recorder (musical instrument)|other uses of the word recorder|Recorder (disambiguation)}}
[[File:VariousRecorderFlutes.jpg|thumb|300px|Various recorders (second from the bottom disassembled into its three parts)]]
The '''recorder''' is a [[woodwind instrument|woodwind]] [[musical instrument]] of the family which includes the [[tin whistle]]. The recorder is end-blown and the mouth of the instrument is constricted by a wooden plug, known as a ''block'' or ''fipple''.&lt;ref&gt;Grove Music Online recommends that use of the word ''fipple'' should be abandoned because its meaning is confused, however, other sources (e.g. the Oxford Dictionary of Music) continue to use it.&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinguished from other members of the family by having holes for seven fingers (the lower one or two often doubled to facilitate the production of [[semitone]]s) and one for the thumb of the uppermost hand.  Recorders can be made out of wood, plastic or ivory.&lt;ref name="Profile of the recorder"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://musiced.about.com/od/windinstruments/p/recorder.htm|title=Profile of the recorder|publisher=About.com Music Education|accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recorder was popular in [[Medieval music|medieval times]] through the [[Baroque music|baroque]] era, but declined in the 18th century in favour of orchestral woodwind instruments, such as the [[flute]], [[oboe]], and [[clarinet]].

The recorder was revived in the 20th century, partly in the pursuit of [[historically informed performance]] of early music, but also because of its suitability as a simple instrument for teaching music. Today, it is sometimes thought of as a child's instrument, but there are many professional players who demonstrate the instrument's full solo range. See [[Recorder (musical instrument)]] for further information on advanced usage.

==Name of the instrument==
The instrument has been known by its modern name at least since the 14th century. ''Grove's Dictionary'' reports the earliest use of the word ''recorder'' was in the household of the [[Earl of Derby]] (later to become [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]]) in 1388: ''{{Lang|la|fistula nomine Recordour}}''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Grove's Dictionary of Music''(online Edition): "Recorder" article, part 1: Nomenclature&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from "to learn by heart", as birds do; the recorder is thought to emulate bird song.

==History==
{{details|Recorder (musical instrument)#History}}
Internal duct-flutes have a long history: an example of an [[Iron Age]] specimen, made from a sheep bone, exists in [[Leeds]] City Museum.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Companion to Music''. See section 1 of "Recorder Family" article&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barocke Blockflöten.png|thumb|Renaissance recorders]]
The recorder achieved great popularity in the 16th and 17th centuries. This development was linked to the fact that [[art music]] (as opposed to [[folk music]]) was no longer the exclusive domain of nobility and clergy. The advent of the printing press made it available to the more affluent commoners as well. The popularity of the instrument also reached the courts however. For example, at [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s death in 1547, an [[Inventory of Henry VIII of England|inventory of his possessions]] included 76 recorders.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Companion to Music''. see section 2 of the article on "Recorder Family"&lt;/ref&gt; There are also numerous references to the instrument in contemporary literature (e.g. [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hamlet]]'', [[s:The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark/Act 3#Scene 2. A hall in the castle.|Act 3, scene 2]], Hamlet: "Ah, ha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Milton|Milton]]&lt;ref&gt;''Paradise Lost, Book I'': "Anon they move/ in perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood/ flutes and soft recorders"&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;For an extensive database of literary references to the recorder see here [http://www.recorderhomepage.net/quotes.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several changes in the construction of recorders took place in the 17th century, resulting in the type of instrument generally referred to as ''Baroque'' recorders, as opposed to the earlier ''Renaissance'' recorders. These innovations allowed baroque recorders to possess a tone which was regarded as "sweeter" than that of the earlier instruments,&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Wainwright and Peter Holman, ''From Renaissance To Baroque: Change in Instruments and Instrumental Music in the Seventeenth Century'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd, 2005. {{ISBN|0-7546-0403-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the expense of a reduction in volume, particularly in the lowest notes, and a slightly reduced range.

The instrument went into decline after the 18th century, being used for about the last time as an otherworldly sound by [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] in his opera ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]].''  By the Romantic era, the recorder had been almost entirely superseded by the flute and clarinet. One variant of the recorder survived into the 19th-century concert halls, however: the keyed recorder known as the [[czakan]] or ''{{lang|de|Stockflöte}}''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

===Modern revival===
The recorder was revived around the turn of the 20th century by [[early music]] enthusiasts, but used almost exclusively for this purpose. It was considered a mainly historical instrument. Even in the early 20th century it was uncommon enough that [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] thought it to be a kind of [[clarinet]], as he told one day to [[Frans Brüggen]], when asked to write a new piece for recorder. This reaction is not surprising since the early clarinet was, in a sense, derived from the recorder, at least in its outward appearance.

The eventual success of the recorder in the modern era is often attributed to [[Arnold Dolmetsch]] in the UK and various German scholar/performers. While he was responsible for broadening interest beyond that of the early music specialist in the UK, Dolmetsch was far from being solely responsible for the recorder's revival. On the Continent his efforts were preceded by those of musicians at the Brussels Conservatoire (where Dolmetsch received his training), and by the performances of the [[Bogenhauser Künstlerkapelle]] (Bogenhausen Artists' Band) based in Germany. Over the period from 1890-1939 the Bogenhausers played music of all ages, including arrangements of classical and romantic music. Also in Germany, the work of Willibald Gurlitt, Werner Danckerts and Gustav Scheck proceeded quite independently of the Dolmetsches.&lt;ref&gt;Eve E. O'Kelly, ''The Recorder Today'', Cambridge University Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-521-36681-X}}. Chapter 1: The Revival&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the revival, far from being the work of one man, was the result of several strands coming and working together.

Carl Dolmetsch, the son of Arnold Dolmetsch, became one of the first virtuoso recorder players in the 1920s; but more importantly he began to commission recorder works from leading composers of his day, especially for performance at the Haslemere festival which his father ran. Initially as a result of this, and later as a result of the development of a Dutch school of recorder playing led by Kees Otten, the recorder was introduced to serious musicians as a virtuoso solo instrument both in Britain and in northern Europe, and consequently modern composers of great stature have written for the recorder, including [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[Jürg Baur]], [[Josef Tal]], [[John Tavener]], [[Michael Tippett]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Gordon Jacob]], [[Malcolm Arnold]], [[Steven Stucky]] and [[Edmund Rubbra]].

The recorder is often used in popular music, including that of groups such as [[The Beatles]];&lt;ref&gt;For example, in ''Fool on the Hill'', according to [http://www.recorderhomepage.net/torture5.html The Recorder Home Page maintained by Nicholas S. Lander] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818095832/http://www.recorderhomepage.net/torture5.html |date=2007-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[the Rolling Stones]] (see, for example, "[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]"); [[Yes (band)|Yes]], for example, in the song "[[I've Seen All Good People]]"; [[Jefferson Airplane]] (see [[Jefferson Airplane#Personnel|Personnel]] as well as [[Grace Slick]]); [[Led Zeppelin]] ([[Stairway to Heaven]]); [[Jimi Hendrix]];&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the song ''[[If 6 Was 9]]'', according to [http://www.recorderhomepage.net/torture5.html The Recorder Home Page maintained by Nicholas S.

Some modern music calls for the recorder to produce unusual noises, [[rhythm]]s and [[Extended technique|effect]]s, by such techniques as [[flutter-tonguing]] and [[overblowing]] to produce [[multiphonics]]. [[David Murphy (composer)|David Murphy]]'s 2002 composition ''Bavardage'' is an example, as is Hans Martin Linde's ''Music for a Bird''.

Among late 20th-century and early 21st-century recorder ensembles, the trio [[Sour Cream Trio|Sour Cream]] (led by [[Frans Brüggen]]), [[Flautando Köln]], the [[Flanders Recorder Quartet]], [[Amsterdam Loeki Stardust Quartet]] and [[Quartet New Generation]] have programmed remarkable mixtures of historical and contemporary repertoire. [[Piers Adams]] is a recorder player who has toured and recorded widely, as well as being involved in education.

[[File:Furulya 001.jpg|thumb|upright|Recorder with German fingering. Note that the 4th finger-hole is larger than the 5th.]]

Recorders are named according to the size of the instrument.  There are two schemes of naming, one linked to the historical use of the instrument, the other to the human voice it most closely resembles.{{Clarify|date=February 2016}}&lt;!--"Descant", "treble", "soprano", "alto", "tenor", and "bass" all refer to singing ranges of the human voice. How can this be different from historical usage?--&gt; 

=== Descant or soprano ===
‘Descant’ is the usual term in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and most of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], while ‘soprano’ is the term used in [[US English]].

This is the most common instrument today and is tuned to C, meaning that the lowest note possible is a [[C (musical note)|C]].  It can be a little shrill, so in advanced playing is often restricted to a descant or extra line above the main melody.  Although actually sounding an octave higher because of the timbre it feels as though it is pitched similarly to a human soprano.  The relatively short spacing between holes and the cheapness of the instrument have made it an ideal first instrument in schools.

=== Treble or alto ===
The treble recorder is the main melody instrument in advanced work, just as the trebles are in church choral music.  When reading accounts of recorders in the past, this is usually the instrument meant unless otherwise stated.  It sounds closest to a human alto voice.  The instrument is tuned to [[F (musical note)|F]].  Many school bands consist of descant/soprano and treble/alto instruments only.  The reach on treble recorders is longer than the descant and this, together with the higher price, make it an instrument for those starting to progress.

=== Tenor ===
The tenor recorder is occasionally found in schools.  It is twice the size of the descant/soprano and so may be too large for children's fingers to reach.  The lowest hole is controlled by one or two keys because of the stretch.  It is also tuned to C, but is an octave below the smaller instrument.

=== Bass ===
The bass is the largest recorder commonly met with.  It is an F instrument, about three times the length of the descant/soprano.  Like the tenor the lowest hole is controlled by keys.

=== Other sizes ===
Specialist players may also employ smaller instruments: garklein (C) and sopranino (F).  There are larger instruments: great bass (C), contrabass (F), subcontrabass (C) and octobass (F).  Intermediate instruments in D, B-flat, G and E-flat exist but will not be found in elementary music.

==Construction and operation==
[[File:Recorder300.svg|left|thumb|Cross-section of the head of a recorder]]
Today, high-quality recorders are made from a range of hardwoods.  Plastic recorders are produced in large quantities. Plastics are cheaper and require less maintenance and quality plastic recorders can be as good as lower-end wooden instruments.  Plastic recorders can be sterilised by soaking in a mild disinfectant, which may be desirable if they are shared between classes.  Beginners' instruments, the sort usually found in children's ensembles, are plastic and can be purchased quite cheaply.

The recorder is held outwards from the player's lips (rather than to the side, like the "transverse" flute). The player's breath is compressed into a linear airstream by a channel cut into the wooden "block" or [[fipple]] (A), in the mouthpiece of the instrument, so as to travel along this channeled duct (B) called the "windway".&lt;ref name=bolton&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.flute-a-bec.com/acoustiquegb.html |first= Philippe |last = Bolton |title= How Recorders Work |accessdate= 2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exiting from the windway, the breath is directed against a hard edge (C), called the "labium" or "ramp", which causes the column of air within the resonator tube to oscillate with [[standing wave]]s. Unlike simple whistles where holes are progressively unstopped, the recorder uses half-holing and forking (see below) to modify the position of the nodes.&lt;ref name=bolton /&gt;

==Notation and pitch==
School recorders are [[Pitch (music)|pitched]] at [[concert pitch]] (A=440&amp;nbsp;Hz).

The recorder family is non-transposing, which means that sheet music for recorder is nearly always written in the key in which it is played. A written C in the score actually sounds as a C.  Recorders are referred to as "C-fingered" or  "F-fingered", depending on the lowest note. This implies that the player must learn two different sets of similar fingerings, one for the C recorders and another for the F recorders. A player may go from one C-fingered instrument to another easily, and from one F-fingered instrument to another easily, but switching between the two requires knowing both sets of fingerings, or the ability to transpose the music at sight.

Descant/soprano recorders transpose at the octave, as does the bass.  In modern scores, octave transpositions may be indicated by adding a small figure "8" above the treble or bass clef on descant/soprano or bass recorder parts, but in the past and still commonly today, the transpositions are not indicated and instead are assumed from context.  Bass instruments use the bass clef but may occasionally use the treble clef and transpose down an octave.  The other three common instruments all use the treble clef.

To make the transition to playing a treble/alto recorder easier, some educational music is written C-fingered, in which case the instrument transposes up a fourth.

As a rule of thumb, recorders sound one octave above the human voice after which they are named (soprano recorder is an octave above soprano voice, alto an octave above alto voice, etc.) The recorder's mellow tone and limited harmonics allows for the seemingly deeper sound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tapiasgold.com/crb/instruments.html www.tapiasgold.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of a modern recorder is usually taken to be about two [[octave]]s except in virtuoso pieces. See the table above for fingerings of notes in the nominal recorder range of 2 octaves and 1 whole tone. Notes above this range are more difficult to play, and the exact fingerings vary from instrument to instrument, so it is impractical to put them into the table here.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Wollitz, ''The Recorder Book'', Knopf, 1984. {{ISBN|0-394-47973-4}}. See Chapter 1, "Technique"&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers at the top correspond to the fingers and the holes on the recorder, according to the pictures.

===Half-holing, forking, and shading===
The lowest chromatic scale degrees – a semitone and a minor third above the lowest note – are played by covering only a part of a hole, a technique known as "half-holing." Most modern instruments are constructed with double holes or keys to facilitate the playing of these notes; such double holes are occasionally found on baroque instruments, where even the hole for the third finger of the left hand can be doubled. Other chromatic scale degrees are played by so-called "fork" fingerings, uncovering one hole and covering one or more of the ones below it. Fork fingerings have a different tonal character from the diatonic notes, giving the recorder a somewhat uneven sound. Budget tenor/bass recorders might have a single key for low C/F but not low C{{music|#}}/F{{music|#}}, making this note virtually impossible to play. Double low keys allowing both C/F and C{{Music|#}}/F{{Music|#}} are more or less standard today.&lt;ref name=ARJtechnique /&gt;

===Pinching===
Most of the notes in the second octave and above are produced by partially opening the thumbhole on the back of the recorder, a technique known as "pinching". There are two basic methods for achieving this: a) drawing the thumb away from the hole, and b) bending the thumb.&lt;ref name="WvHTheModernRecorderPlayerChapt5"&gt;Walter van Hauwe, ''The Modern Recorder Player'', Volume I, Schott, 1984. ISMN 979-0-2201-1382-6. See Part II, Chapter 5, "The Left Thumb"&lt;/ref&gt; The first method uses only the skin of the thumb to define the opening, while the second method uses also the nail edge. The latter technique enables better feel and thus control of the size of the opening.&lt;ref name="WvHTheModernRecorderPlayerChapt5"/&gt; The placement of the thumb is crucial to the tone, intonation and stability of these notes, and varies as the notes increase in pitch, making the boring of a double hole for the thumb unviable. To play the notes in the second register and above, the player must generally blow more air into the instrument and/or tongue somewhat harder to excite the second or upper harmonics of the instrument.&lt;ref name=ARJtechnique /&gt; This is, however, not universally true; it is possible for example to slur ''piano'' between and in the second and third registers.&lt;ref&gt;Gudrun Heyens, ''Advanced Recorder Technique'', Volume I, Schott, 2005. {{ISBN|3-7957-0516-9}}. See Chapter 3, "Scales/Arpeggios/Chromatic Scales", p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===German fingering===
In the early part of the 20th century, [[Peter Harlan]] developed a recorder that allowed for apparently simpler fingering, called German fingering. A recorder designed for German fingering has a hole five which is smaller than hole four, whereas baroque and neo-baroque recorders have a hole four which is smaller than hole five. The immediate difference in fingering is for F and B{{Music|b}} which on a neo-baroque instrument must be fingered 0 123 4–67. With German fingering, this becomes a simpler 0 123 4 – – –. Unfortunately, however, this causes many other chromatic notes to be too badly out of tune to be usable.&lt;ref name=ARJtechnique&gt;A Rowland-Jones, ''Recorder Technique'' {{ISBN|0-907908-75-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; German fingering became popular in Europe, especially Germany, in the 1930s, but rapidly became obsolete in the 1950s as the recorder began to be treated more seriously and the limitations of German fingering became more widely appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Hunt, ''The Recorder And Its Music''&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, many recorder makers continue to produce German fingered instruments today, essentially for beginner use only.

==Dynamics==
Changes in dynamics are not easy to achieve on the recorder if the player is accustomed to other wind instruments. The general belief is that if the player blows harder to play louder, or more softly to play softer, the pitch changes and the note goes out of tune, and unlike the transverse flute, the player cannot change the position of the mouth in relation to the labium in order to compensate, and that therefore the recorder is not capable of dynamic changes. This is misleading.  Subtle changes in wind pressure are possible if the player has a good ear for tuning and knows how hard the instrument can be pushed before pitch changes become noticeable. But this is not the correct approach to recorder dynamics.&lt;ref name=ARJtechnique /&gt;&lt;ref name=ARJsonatas&gt;A Rowland-Jones, ''Playing Recorder Sonatas'' Clarendon Press {{ISBN|0-19-879001-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the recorder it is better to think of the breath controlling pitch, and the fingers controlling dynamics; for example by resting the fingers lightly on the holes breath leaks around them, lifting the pitch; and the resulting instinctive change in breath pressure to bring the pitch back also drops the volume.  The recorder is notable for its sensitivity to articulation; in addition to its obvious use for artistic effect skilled players can also use this sensitivity to suggest changes in volume.&lt;ref name=ARJsonatas /&gt;

==Use in schools==
[[File:Japanese YAMAHA Instruments Recorders 1.JPG|thumb|Plastic recorder ([[Yamaha]])]]
In the mid-20th century, German composer and music educator [[Carl Orff]] popularized the recorder for use in schools as part of [[Orff-Schulwerk]] programs in German schools. Orff's five-volume opus of educational music ''Music for Children'' contains many pieces for recorders, usually scored for other instruments as well.&lt;ref&gt;Regner, Hermann. Orff-Schulwerk Floetenbuch, Preface. Translated by I.M. Rushworth. http://www.vosa.org/paul/sales_folder/orff_recorder.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturers have made recorders out of [[bakelite]] and other more modern plastics; they are thus easy to produce, hence inexpensive. Because of this, recorders are popular in schools, as they are one of the cheapest instruments to buy in bulk.&lt;ref&gt;Margo Hall, ''Teaching Kids Recorder'', iUniverse, 2005. {{ISBN|0-595-36743-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also relatively easy to play at a basic level because sound production needs only breath, and pitch is basically determined by fingering. It is, however, incorrect to assume that mastery is similarly easy—like any other instrument, the recorder requires study to play well and in tune, and significant study to play at an advanced or professional level.

==Unconventional uses==
[[File:Blockflötenkopf.ogg|thumb|Playing on a Soprano recorder head joint]]

The head of recorders is sometimes used as a [[noisemaker|noise]], [[rhythm]] and [[sound effect|effect]] instrument, and as a toy musical instrument with children (e. g. in a [[rhythm band]]), since the recorder head works like a [[whistle]]. With a bit of practice, it is easy to play all kind of rhythms. Effects are made by opening and covering the lower end of the head joint with the hand while blowing. Agnes Dorwarth of the [[Hochschule für Musik Freiburg]] argues this is an attractive way to get children to play with part of the instrument, which can make playing the entire instrument more inviting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musikschulen.de/projekte/musikschulkongress/musikschulkongress13/ag7/index.html|title=AG 7 - Musikschulkongress '13|last=Dorwarth|first=Agnes|publisher=[[:de:Verband deutscher Musikschulen|Verband deutscher Musikschulen]]|accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many players blow harder than "normal" recorder playing (like with a [[pea whistle]]) to achieve a very loud, shrill and penetrating sound.

The recorder can also give an effect by striking the bell with the palm of the hand.  The note varies according to the type of instrument.  Although unfingered the note will be a soft version of the lowest note of the recorder.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}&lt;!--Not my experience, but if a reliable source says so . . .--&gt;

Additional effects can be obtained by blowing across the window, somewhat after the manner of a flute.  Fingering can be used; the effect is like a soft, breathy, baroque flute.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Recorder ensembles==
The recorder is a very social instrument. Many recorder players participate in large groups or in one-to-a-part chamber groups, and there is a wide variety of music for such groupings including many modern works. Groups of different sized instruments help to compensate for the limited note range of the individual instruments. Four part arrangements with a soprano, alto, tenor and bass part played on the corresponding recorders are common, although more complex arrangements with multiple parts for each instrument and parts for lower and higher instruments may also be regularly encountered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Recorder+flute |title=Recorder flute definition of Recorder flute in the Free Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Orion1 big.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Airglow made visible from aboard the [[International Space Station|ISS]]]]

'''Sky brightness''' refers to the [[visual perception]] of the [[sky]] and how it [[light scattering|scatters]] and [[diffuse sky radiation|diffuses]] light. The fact that the sky is not completely dark at [[night]] is easily visible. If light sources (e.g. the [[moonlight|Moon]] and [[light pollution]]) were removed from the [[night sky]], it would appear absolutely dark. [[Silhouette]]s of objects against the sky itself would not be visible.

The sky's brightness varies greatly over the day, and the primary cause differs as well. During [[daytime]], when the [[Sun]] is above the horizon, the [[Rayleigh scattering|direct scattering]] of [[sunlight]] is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. During [[twilight]] (the duration after [[sunset]] or before [[sunrise]] until or since, respectively, the full darkness of night), the situation is more complicated, and a further differentiation is required.

Twilight (both [[dusk]] and [[dawn]]) is divided into three 6° segments that mark the Sun's position below the horizon. At [[civil twilight]], the center of the Sun's disk appears to be between 1/4° and 6° below the horizon. At [[nautical twilight]], the Sun's [[horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] is between –6° and –12°. At [[astronomical twilight]], the Sun is between –12° and –18°. When the Sun's depth is more than 18°, the sky generally attains its maximum darkness.

Sources of the night sky's intrinsic brightness include [[airglow]], indirect scattering of [[sunlight]], scattering of [[starlight]], and [[skyglow|light pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=F. Patat |url=http://www.eso.org/~fpatat/science/skybright/ |title=The Brightness of the Night Sky |publisher=[[European Southern Observatory|ESO]] |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Airglow==
When physicist [[Anders Ångström]] examined the spectrum of the [[aurora borealis]], he discovered that even on nights when the aurora was absent, its characteristic green line was still present. It was not until the 1920s that scientists were beginning to identify and understand the [[emission line]]s in aurorae and of the sky itself, and what was causing them. The green line Angstrom observed is in fact an emission line with a wavelength of 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm, caused by the recombination of oxygen in the upper atmosphere.

Airglow is the collective name of the various processes in the upper atmosphere that result in the emission of photons, with the driving force being primarily [[ultraviolet|UV radiation]] from the Sun. Several emission lines are dominant: a green line from oxygen at 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm, a yellow doublet from sodium at 589.0 and 589.6&amp;nbsp;nm, and red lines from oxygen at 630.0 and 636.4&amp;nbsp;nm.

The sodium emissions come from a thin [[sodium layer]] approximately 10&amp;nbsp;km thick at an altitude of 90–100&amp;nbsp;km, above the [[mesopause]] and in the D-layer of the [[ionosphere]]. The red oxygen lines originate at altitudes of about 300&amp;nbsp;km, in the F-layer. The green oxygen emissions are more spatially distributed. How sodium gets to mesospheric heights is not yet well understood, but it is believed to be a combination of upward transport of [[sea salt]] and [[meteor]]itic dust.

In daytime, sodium and red oxygen emissions are dominant and roughly 1,000 times as bright as nighttime emissions because in daytime, the upper atmosphere is fully exposed to solar UV radiation. The effect is however not noticeable to the human eye, since the glare of [[Rayleigh scattering|directly scattered]] sunlight outshines and obscures it.

==Indirect scattering of sunlight==
[[Image:Illuminated-arimass.png|250px|thumb|Amount of air still illuminated after sunset, at the horizon. Normalized so that zenith is 1 airmass]]
Indirectly scattered sunlight comes from two directions. From the atmosphere itself, and from outer space. In the first case, the sun has just set but still illuminates the upper atmosphere directly. Because the amount of scattered sunlight is proportional to the number of scatterers (i.e. air molecules) in the line of sight, the intensity of this light decreases rapidly as the sun drops further below the horizon and illuminates less of the atmosphere.

When the sun's altitude is &lt; -6° 99% of the atmosphere in [[zenith]] is in the Earth's shadow and second order scattering takes over. At the horizon, however, 35% of the atmosphere along the line of sight is still directly illuminated, and continues to be until the sun reaches -12°. From -12° to -18° only the uppermost parts of the atmosphere along the horizon, directly above the spot where the sun is, is still illuminated. After that, all direct illumination ceases and astronomical darkness sets in.

A second source sunlight is the [[zodiacal light]], which is caused by reflection and scattering of sunlight on interplanetary dust. Zodiacal light varies quite a lot in intensity depending on the position of the earth, location of the observer, time of year, and composition and distribution of the reflecting dust.

==Scattered light from extraterrestrial sources==
Not only sunlight is scattered by the molecules in the air. Starlight and the diffuse light of the milky way are also scattered by the air, and it is found that stars up to V magnitude 16 contribute to the diffuse scattered starlight.

Other sources such as galaxies and nebulae don't contribute significantly.

The total brightness of all the stars was first measured by Burns in 1899, with a calculated result that the total brightness reaching earth was equivalent to that of 2,000 first-magnitude stars &lt;ref&gt;Burns, G. J., "The total amount of starlight and the brightness of the sky," ''The Observatory, Vol. 33'', p. 123-129, March 1910; available at [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1910Obs....33..123B SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System] (retrieved 27 Nov. 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; with subsequent measurements by others.&lt;ref&gt;Yntema, L., "On the Brightness of the Sky and Total Amount of Starlight," ''Publications of the Kapteyn Astronomical Laboratory Groningen, vol. 22'', pp.1-55 (1909); available at [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1909PGro...22....1Y SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System] (retrieved 27 Nov. 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
''

==Light pollution==
{{Main|Light pollution}}
Light pollution is an ever-increasing source of sky brightness in [[Urban area|urbanized area]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. In densely populated areas that do not have stringent light pollution control, the entire night sky is regularly 5 to 50 times brighter than it would be if all lights were switched off, and very often the influence of light pollution is far greater than natural sources (including moonlight). With [[urbanization]] and light pollution, one third of humanity, and the majority of those in developed countries, cannot see the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/10/milky-way-no-longer-visible-to-one-third-of-humanity-light-pollution|title=Milky Way no longer visible to one third of humanity, light pollution atlas shows|last=Davis|first=Nicola|date=2016-06-10|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twilight==
When the sun has just set, the brightness of the sky decreases rapidly, thereby enabling us to see the airglow that is caused from such high altitudes that they are still fully sunlit until the sun drops more than about 12° below the horizon. During this time, yellow emissions from the sodium layer and red emissions from the 630&amp;nbsp;nm oxygen lines are dominant, and contribute to the purplish color sometimes seen during civil and nautical twilight.

After the sun has also set for these altitudes at the end of nautical twilight, the intensity of light emanating from earlier mentioned lines decreases, until the oxygen-green remains as the dominant source.

When astronomical darkness has set in, the green 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm oxygen line is dominant, and atmospheric scattering of starlight occurs.

Differential refraction causes different parts of the spectrum to dominate, producing a [[Golden hour (photography)|golden hour]] and a [[blue hour]].

==Relative contributions==
The following table gives the relative and absolute contributions to night sky brightness at zenith on a perfectly dark night at middle latitudes without moonlight and in the absence of any [[light pollution]].

(The S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; unit is defined as the surface brightness of a star whose V-magnitude is 10 and whose light is smeared over one square degree, or 27.78 mag arcsec&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.)

The total sky brightness in zenith is therefore ~220 S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; or 21.9 mag/arcsec² in the V-band. Note that the contributions from Airglow and Zodiacal light vary with the time of year, the solar cycle, and the observer's latitude roughly as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Airglow}/{\rm S}_{10} = 145+108(S-0.8)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''S'' is the solar 10.7&amp;nbsp;cm flux in MJy, and various sinusoidally between 0.8 and 2.0 with the 11-year solar cycle, yielding an upper contribution of ~270 S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; at solar maximum.

The intensity of zodiacal light depends on the [[Ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic latitude and longitude]] of the point in the sky being observed relative to that of the sun. At ecliptic longitudes differing from the sun's by &gt; 90 degrees, the relation is 
:&lt;math&gt; {\rm ZodiacalLight}/{\rm S}_{10} = 140 - 90\sin(|\beta|)&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''β'' is the ecliptic latitude and is smaller than 60°, when larger than 60 degrees the contribution is that given in the table. Along the ecliptic plane there are enhancements in the zodiacal light where it is much brighter near the sun and with a secondary maximum opposite the sun at 180 degrees longitude (the [[gegenschein]]).

In extreme cases natural zenith sky brightness can be as high as ~21.0 mag/arcsec², roughly twice as bright as nominal conditions.

The '''Society for Underwater Historical Research''' (SUHR) was an amateur [[maritime archaeology]] organisation operating in [[South Australia]] (SA). It was formed in 1974 by [[Recreational diving|recreational scuba divers]] and other persons to pursue an interest in [[maritime archaeology]] and [[maritime history]]. The SUHR was renamed as the [[South Australian Archaeology Society]] in March 2012 as part of a plan to expand its activities beyond maritime archaeology to include other archaeological disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Steve; (2012) 'Club News' in ''SDF News Sheet – June 2012” (Scuba Divers Federation of South Australia), at http://www.sdfsa.net/newsletters/2012/2012-06-News-Sheet.pdf, retrieved 11/06/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The SUHR was founded in September 1974 by recreational scuba divers principally from the Underwater Explorers Club of South Australia (UEC) and [[Professional diving|occupational scuba divers]] from government agencies such as the [[South Australian Museum]] and the [[South Australia Police|South Australian Police]], as well as a number of individuals interested in [[maritime history]].&lt;ref&gt;Brock, A.E., 1977, ‘The Society for Underwater Historical Research of South Australia’, In Green, J. (Ed.), 1977, ''Papers from the First Southern Hemisphere Conference on Maritime Archaeology'', Perth, Western Australia, Oceans Society of Australia, Australian Sports Publications, Melbourne, Victoria, pp. 113-115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last =Jeffery  | first =B.  | author-link =   | title =South Australian Maritime Heritage Program 1970s – 2002 Projects, Activities and Bibliography

The origin of the SUHR is due in part to the positive public response to the aftermath of a successful expedition in 1973 to locate and recover 2 [[anchor]]s discarded during 1803 by the [[HMS Investigator (1798)|HMS ''Investigator'']] whilst under the command of [[Matthew Flinders]] off the coast of what is now Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Brock, A.E., 1977, ‘The Society for Underwater Historical Research of South Australia’, In Green, J. (Ed.), 1977, ''Papers from the First Southern Hemisphere Conference on Maritime Archaeology'', Perth, Western Australia, Oceans Society of Australia, Australian Sports Publications, Melbourne, Victoria, pp. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;  The recovery of the anchors and their connection to the voyage of the HMS ''Investigator'' is commemorated in the inclusion of the best bower anchor and the outline of the Australian continent on the SUHR emblem.&lt;ref&gt;‘Second Annual Report, September 1976’, pp.2, in Cowan, David (editor), (2007), ''The Society for Underwater Historical Research – Publications 1974-2004'', Society for Underwater Historical Research, Port Adelaide, SA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
After its formation in 1974, the SUHR was initially managed by a committee consisting of a President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer and the following specialist officers – Research Officer, Registrar of Relics (added in 1976), an officer to liaise with the responsible part of the South Australian Government which was initially the South Australian Museum, and an officer to liaise with the South Australian Police Force (removed in 1978). By the late 1970s, it had evolved into a project-based organisation whose work consisted of activities such as planning, research, exploration, logistics, photography, survey and the publication of reports. Activities such as recovery and conservation, while historically significant, ceased to be carried out in the late 1980s except where permitted by archaeological practice.&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, David; (2007), 'About the SUHR', in Cowan, David (editor); (2007), ''The Society for Underwater Historical Research – Publications 1974-2004'' , Society for Underwater Historical Research, Port Adelaide, SA. pages 9-14.&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 1982, a group within the membership who were unhappy with the increasing level of professionalization, resigned and founded a competing organisation known as the [[Nautical Archaeology Association of South Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;‘Letter to Society for Underwater Historical Research Committee’ in the SUHR Newsletter for April 1982, Cowan, David (editor); (2007), ''The Society for Underwater Historical Research – Publications 1974-2004'', Society for Underwater Historical Research, Port Adelaide, SA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Minutes of the General Meeting held … on Tuesday 27 April 1982’ in SUHR Newsletter for May 1982, Cowan, David (editor); (2007), ''The Society for Underwater Historical Research – Publications 1974-2004'' , Society for Underwater Historical Research, Port Adelaide, SA.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1999, after nearly a decade of stagnation, new life was breathed in the organisation via new funding opportunities and interest in membership from undergraduate and postgraduate archaeology students.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, N. &amp; Lewczak, C., (2002), ''Back to the Bay: An overview of the Holdfast Bay Project 1974-2000 and the reinvigoration of avocational maritime archaeology in South Australia'', Bulletin of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology Vol. 26, pp. 19-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tadhkirat al-Fuqahā''' (Memorandum for Jurists) is a book on Shiite jurisprudence written by Allameh [[Al-Hilli]]. The book is counted as one of the greatest reasonable books on [[Shiite]] jurisprudence.

==Introduction==
The book of Tadhkirat al-Fuqahā counted as one of the greatest reasonably comparative books on Shiite jurisprudence or [[fiqh]]. The book is also referred to by other scholars as a confident reference. Allameh Hilli mainly points to opinions and ideas of Shaykh Tousi rather that of other Shiite Scholars.

==Motive==
The book has written by the request of Allameh [[Al-Hilli]]' s son namely Fakhr Al Muhaqeqin(Died.767 lunar)

==Style==
Allameh [[Al-Hilli]] says about his aim that he intent to express and explain the summaries of indult (Fatwa) of the jurist and rules of Scholars (Ulama) according to best explanation, the most correctness way, the most rightness style and the most confident methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilli|first=Hasan ibn Yousef| title= Tadhkirat al-Fuqah|publisher= Ale bayt|language=Arabic| place= Qom|date=1414 lunar|volume=1| page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The author divided the book into four rules such as: on prayings, on transactions, on unilateral obligation, on judgments. The book is divided to fifteen sections; some of them are as follow:
* The book of purity
* The books of Alms and fasting
* The book of safekeeping
* The book of buying either pecuniary or credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilli|first=Hasan ibn Yousef| title= Tadhkirat al-Fuqah|publisher= Ale bayt| language=Arabic|  place= Qom|date=1414 lunar|volume=1| pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
The book has many characters. Some of them are as follows:
* Refer to consensus (Ijma) as Jomhourat Al Ulama or most of the religious scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilli|first=Hasan ibn Yousef|title=Tadhkirat al-Fuqah|publisher=Ale bayt|language=Arabic|date=1414 lunar|volume=1 &amp; 2|pages=64–115 &amp; 36–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Documentation through Imam's narrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilli|first=Hasan ibn Yousef|title=Tadhkirat al-Fuqah|publisher=Ale bayt|language=Arabic|date=1414 lunar|volume=1 &amp; 2|pages=71–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rejecting of juridical principles such as Istehsan and Qiyyas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilli|first=Hasan ibn Yousef|title= Tadhkirat al-Fuqah|publisher=Ale Bayt|language=Arabic|date=1414 lunar|volume=1 &amp; 2|pages=165–173 &amp; 92}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* using of public recourses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilli|first=Hasan ibn Yousef|title=Tadhkirat al-Fuqah|publisher=Ale bayt|language=Arabic|date=1414 lunar|volume=1|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summarize==
The book has summarized by Ibn Motawwej Bahrani, one of the great pupils of Allameh Hilli, in a book by the title of "Mokhtasar Al Tadhkrah".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Terani|first=Aqa Bozorg|title=Zariah Fi Tasanif Al Shiah|publisher=Dar Al Azwa|place=Beyrout|language=Arabic|date=1403|volume=4|page=422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
The book has published many times in [[Iraq]], [[Iran]]. The book until now published in twelve volumes. Also some part of Al Tadhkerah has published by Allameh Mozaffar and sayyed Mortaza Khalkhali in [[Najaf]].

[[Genichi Taguchi|Taguchi]]'s work includes three principal contributions to statistics:
*A [[Taguchi loss function|specific]] [[loss function]]
*The philosophy of ''off-line quality control''; and
*Innovations in the [[design of experiments]].

==Loss functions==

===Loss functions in the statistical theory===
Traditionally, statistical methods have relied on [[unbiased estimator|mean-unbiased estimators]] of [[Design of experiments|treatment effects]]: Under the conditions of the [[Gauss–Markov theorem]], [[least squares]] estimators have minimum variance among all mean-unbiased estimators. The emphasis on comparisons of means also draws (limiting) comfort from the [[law of large numbers]], according to which the [[sample mean]]s [[Convergence (mathematics)|converge]] to the true mean. Fisher's textbook on the [[design of experiments]] emphasized comparisons of treatment means.

However, loss functions were avoided by [[Ronald A. Fisher]].&lt;ref&gt;In fact, Fisher labelled [[loss functions]] as being better suited for American businessmen and Soviet comisars than for empirical scientists (in Fisher's 1956 attack on Wald in the 1956 ''JRSS'').&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taguchi's use of loss functions===
Taguchi knew [[statistical theory]] mainly from the followers of [[Ronald A. Fisher]], who also avoided [[loss function]]s. 
Reacting to Fisher's methods in the [[design of experiments]], Taguchi interpreted Fisher's methods as being adapted for seeking to improve the [[mean]] outcome of a [[wikt:process|process]]. Indeed, Fisher's work had been largely motivated by programmes to compare agricultural yields under different treatments and blocks, and such experiments were done as part of a long-term programme to improve harvests.

However, Taguchi realised that in much industrial production, there is a need to produce an outcome ''on target'', for example, to [[machine]] a hole to a specified diameter, or to manufacture a [[electrochemical cell|cell]] to produce a given [[voltage]]. He also realised, as had [[Walter A. Shewhart]] and others before him, that excessive variation lay at the root of poor manufactured quality and that reacting to individual items inside and outside specification was counterproductive.

He therefore argued that [[quality engineering]] should start with an understanding of [[quality costs]] in various situations. In much conventional [[industrial engineering]], the quality costs are simply represented by the number of items outside specification multiplied by the cost of rework or scrap. However, Taguchi insisted that manufacturers broaden their horizons to consider ''cost to society''. Though the short-term costs may simply be those of non-conformance, any item manufactured away from nominal would result in some loss to the customer or the wider community through early wear-out; difficulties in interfacing with other parts, themselves probably wide of nominal; or the need to build in safety margins. These losses are [[externalities]] and are usually ignored by manufacturers, which are more interested in their [[private cost]]s than [[social cost]]s. Such externalities prevent markets from operating efficiently, according to analyses of [[public economics]]. Taguchi argued that such losses would inevitably find their way back to the originating corporation (in an effect similar to the [[tragedy of the commons]]), and that by working to minimise them, manufacturers would enhance brand reputation, win markets and generate profits.

Such losses are, of course, very small when an item is near to negligible. [[Donald J. Wheeler]] characterised the region within specification limits as where we ''deny that losses exist''. As we diverge from nominal, losses grow until the point where ''losses are too great to deny'' and the specification limit is drawn. All these losses are, as [[W. Edwards Deming]] would describe them, ''unknown and unknowable'', but Taguchi wanted to find a useful way of representing them statistically. Taguchi specified three situations:

#Larger the better (for example, agricultural yield);
#Smaller the better (for example, [[carbon dioxide]] emissions); and
#On-target, minimum-variation (for example, a mating part in an assembly).

The first two cases are represented by simple [[monotonic function|monotonic]] loss functions. In the third case, Taguchi adopted a squared-error loss function for several reasons:
*It is the first "symmetric" term in the [[Taylor series]] expansion of [[real analytic]] loss-functions.
*Total loss is measured by the [[variance]]. For [[uncorrelated]] [[random variables]], as variance is additive the total loss is an additive measurement of cost.
*The squared-error loss function is widely used in [[statistics]], following Gauss's use of the squared-error loss function in justifying the method of [[least squares]].

===Reception of Taguchi's ideas by statisticians===
Though many of Taguchi's concerns and conclusions are welcomed by statisticians and [[economist]]s, some ideas have been especially criticized. For example, Taguchi's recommendation that industrial experiments maximise some ''[[signal-to-noise ratio]]'' (representing the magnitude of the [[Expected value|mean]] of a process compared to its variation) has been criticized widely. {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Off-line quality control==

===Taguchi's rule for manufacturing===

Taguchi realized that the best opportunity to eliminate variation of the final product quality is during the design of a product and its manufacturing process. Consequently, he developed a strategy for quality engineering that can be used in both contexts. The process has three stages:

*System design 
*Parameter (measure) design
*Tolerance design

====System design====

This is design at the conceptual level, involving [[creativity]] and [[innovation]].

====Parameter design====

Once the concept is established, the nominal values of the various dimensions and design parameters need to be set, the [[detail design]] phase of conventional engineering. Taguchi's radical insight was that the exact choice of values required is under-specified by the performance requirements of the system. In many circumstances, this allows the parameters to be chosen so as to minimize the effects on performance arising from variation in manufacture, environment and cumulative damage. This is sometimes called [[robustification]].

[[Robust parameter design (RPD)|Robust parameter designs]] consider controllable and uncontrollable noise variables; they seek to exploit relationships and optimize settings that minimize the effects of the noise variables.

====Tolerance design====
{{main article|Pareto principle}}
With a successfully completed ''parameter design'', and an understanding of the effect that the various parameters have on performance, resources can be focused on reducing and controlling variation in the critical few dimensions.

==Design of experiments==

Taguchi developed his experimental theories independently. Taguchi read works following [[R. A. Fisher]] only in 1954. Taguchi's framework for [[design of experiments]] is [[idiosyncratic]] and often flawed, but contains much that is of enormous value. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} He made a number of innovations.

===Outer arrays===

Taguchi's designs aimed to allow greater understanding of variation than did many of the traditional designs from the [[analysis of variance]] (following Fisher). Taguchi contended  that conventional [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] is inadequate here as there is no way of obtaining a [[simple random sample|random sample]] of future conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Similar truisms about the [[problem of induction]] had been voiced by [[David Hume|Hume]] and (more recently) by [[W. Edwards Deming]] in his discussion of [[analytic studies]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In Fisher's [[design of experiments]] and [[analysis of variance]], experiments aim to reduce the influence of [[Randomized block design#Blocking to .22remove.22 the effect of nuisance factors|nuisance factor]]s to allow comparisons of the mean treatment-effects. Variation becomes even more central in Taguchi's thinking.

Taguchi proposed extending each experiment with an "outer array" (possibly an [[orthogonal array]]); the "outer array" should simulate the random environment in which the product would function. This is an example of [[Nonprobability sampling|judgmental sampling]]. Many quality specialists have been using "outer arrays".

Later innovations in outer arrays resulted in "compounded noise."  This involves combining a few noise factors to create two levels in the outer array: First, noise factors that drive output lower, and second, noise factors that drive output higher.  "Compounded noise" simulates the extremes of noise variation but uses fewer experimental runs than would previous Taguchi designs.

===Management of interactions===

====Interactions, as treated by Taguchi====
Many of the orthogonal arrays that Taguchi has advocated are [[saturated array]]s, allowing no scope for estimation of interactions. This is a continuing topic of controversy.  However, this is only true for "control factors" or factors in the "inner array".  By combining an inner array of control factors with an outer array of "noise factors", Taguchi's approach provides "full information" on control-by-noise interactions, it is claimed.  Taguchi argues that such interactions have the greatest importance in achieving a design that is robust to noise factor variation.  The Taguchi approach provides more complete interaction information than typical fractional factorial designs, its adherents claim.

*Followers of Taguchi argue that the designs offer rapid results and that [[interaction (statistics)|interaction]]s can be eliminated by proper choice of quality characteristics. That notwithstanding, a "confirmation experiment" offers protection against any residual interactions. If the quality characteristic represents the energy transformation of the system, then the "likelihood" of control factor-by-control factor interactions is greatly reduced, since "energy" is "additive".&lt;!-- NEEDS EDITING. Citations are needed. Likelihood?? Additive energy?? Also, it is inappropriate to reference followers qua followers for substantive arguments.--&gt;

====Inefficiencies of Taguchi's designs====
* Interactions are part of the [[reality|real world]]. In Taguchi's arrays, interactions are [[confounding|confounded]] and difficult to resolve.

Statisticians in [[response surface methodology]] (RSM) advocate the "sequential assembly" of [[response surface methodology|designs]]: In the RSM approach, a [[Sampling (statistics)|screening]] design is followed by a "follow-up design" that resolves only the confounded interactions judged worth resolution. A second follow-up design may be added (time and resources allowing) to explore possible [[Higher-order statistics|high-order]] univariate effects of the remaining variables, as high-order univariate effects are less likely in variables already eliminated for having no linear effect. With the economy of screening designs and the flexibility of follow-up designs, sequential designs have great [[efficiency (statistics)|statistical efficiency]]. The sequential designs of [[response surface methodology]] require far fewer experimental runs than would a sequence of Taguchi's designs.&lt;ref&gt;
Statisticians have developed designs that enable experiments to use fewer replications (or experimental runs), enabling savings over Taguchi's proposed designs:

===Analysis of experiments===

==Assessment==
Genichi Taguchi has made valuable contributions to statistics and [[engineering]]. His emphasis on ''loss to society'', techniques for investigating variation in experiments, and his overall strategy of system, parameter and tolerance design have been influential in improving manufactured quality worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Gal I. (2005), "On the Use of Data Compression Measures to Assess Robust Designs", IEEE Trans. on Reliability, Vol. 54, no. 3, 381-388. Available at: http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~bengal/Journal%20Paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the statistical aspects of the Taguchi methods are disputable, they are widely applied to various processes. The methods are being successfully implemented in diverse areas, such as the design of VLSI; optimization of communication &amp; information networks, development of electronic circuits, [[laser engraving]] of photo masks, cash-flow optimization in banking, government policymaking, runway utilization improvement in airports, and even robust eco-design.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Gal I., Katz R. and Bukchin J., "Robust Eco-Design: A New Application for Quality Engineering", IIE Transactions, Vol. 40 (10), p. 907 - 918.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2315">'''Tannosomes''' are [[organelle]]s found in [[plant cell]]s of [[vascular plant]]s.

== Formation and functions ==
Tannosomes are formed when the [[chloroplast]] membrane forms pockets filled with [[tannin]]. Slowly, the pockets [[Budding|break off as tiny vacuoles]] that carry tannins to the large [[vacuole]] filled with acidic fluid.&lt;ref name=SciencenewsTannosome&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tannosome?mode=magazine&amp;context=187621 |title = Tannosome |date = 2013-10-30 |publisher = Science News |accessdate = 2014-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tannins are then released into the vacuole and stored inside as tannin accretions.

They are responsible for synthesizing and producing [[condensed tannin]]s and [[polyphenols]]. Tannosomes condense tannins in chlorophyllous organs, providing [[Plant defense against herbivory|defenses against herbivores]] and pathogens, and protection against UV radiation.&lt;ref name=TannosomeUse&amp;Discovery&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/37597/title/New-Organelle--The-Tannosome/ |title = New Organelle: The Tannosome |author = Kerry Grens |date = 2013-09-23 |publisher = The Scientist Magazine® |accessdate = 2014-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
Tannosomes were discovered in September 2013 by French and Hungarian researchers.&lt;ref name=TannosomeUse&amp;Discovery/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/aob/mct168| title = The tannosome is an organelle forming condensed tannins in the chlorophyllous organs of Tracheophyta| journal = Annals of Botany| volume = 112| issue = 6| pages = 1003| year = 2013| last1 = Brillouet | first1 = J. -M. | last2 = Romieu | first2 = C.| last3 = Schoefs | first3 = B.| last4 = Solymosi | first4 = K.| last5 = Cheynier | first5 = V.| last6 = Fulcrand | first6 = H.| last7 = Verdeil | first7 = J. -L. | last8 = Conejero | first8 = G. | pmid=24026439 | pmc=3783233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of tannosomes showed how to get enough tannins to change the flavour of [[wine]], [[tea]], [[chocolate]], and other food or snacks.&lt;ref name=SciencenewsTannosome/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16067">The '''theology of religions''' is the branch of [[theology]] (mostly represented by [[Christian theology|Christian]], [[Hinduism|Hindu]], [[Islam]]ic and [[Judaism|Jewish]] theology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bronk |first=Andrzej |title=Podstawy nauk o religii |others=Antoni Fetkowski (ed.) |publisher=Wydawnictwo Towarzystwa Naukowego KUL |location=Lublin |year=1996 |pages=129 |chapter=11. Teologia religii |isbn=83-86668-44-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[religious studies]] that attempts to theologically evaluate the phenomena of religions. Three important schools within Christian part of this field are pluralism, inclusivism, and exclusivism, which describe the relation of other religious traditions to Christianity and attempt to answer questions about the nature of God and salvation.

==Purpose==
The American theologian [[Langdon Brown Gilkey]] argued that the political situation of the West following [[World War II]] set up a need for Christian thinkers to reconsider the place of other religions specifically because of the changing political world:

:Colonies vanished, Europe disappeared as a major power, other non-western power centers appeared representing other ways of life and other religions. The West no longer ruled the world... Western religion became one among the other world religions.&lt;ref&gt;Gilkey, "Plurality and Its Theological Implications", in ''The Myth of Christian Uniqueness: Toward a Pluralistic Theology of Religions'' (edited by [[John Hick]]), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic Three-Point Model==
The most common model of the view that one takes of other religions has been viewed in a simple, three point model, first articulated by Alan Race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Race |first=Alan |date=1982 |title= Christians and Religious Pluralism: Patterns in the Christian Theology of Religions |location= Maryknoll, NY|publisher=Orbis Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pluralism===
Pluralism is basically the belief that the world religions are true and equally valid in their communication of the truth about God, the world, and salvation. The chief expounder of this view is [[John Hick]] of [[Claremont Graduate School]] in California, who first propounded it in his book ''God and the Universe of Faiths (1973)''. It has been notably criticized in the declaration [[Dominus Iesus]] by Cardinal [[Joseph Ratzinger]].

This is the popular view that all religions lead to the same God and all ways lead to heaven. According to Hick, Christianity is not the one and only way of salvation, but one among several. To a pluralist such as Hick, Christianity is not the absolute, unique, and final way to God. While pluralists assert the validity of all religions, they also deny the finality of all religions. According to Hick, in the evolutionary scheme of things in which at isolated ages and places the early religions are succeeded by higher religions, it is the same message of God that comes distinctly to a particular group but in a different form from the others. Hick challenges the older view that Christ or Christianity must be seen at the center of religions. Rather, he says, God must be seen at the center of religions. This view is also called theo-centrism. The pluralistic contention is that although religions have different outward forms, all have the same source.

To an evangelical Christian, such pluralism only means the abolition of ''kerygmatic'' mission (i.e., the mission of evangelizing the world with the salvific gospel of Jesus Christ).  Pluralism has been criticized for masquerading as Christianity when in fact it is an invasive force that comes from outside of Christianity and imperialistically demands the surrender of Christian distinctiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Alister E. McGrath, "Conclusion," in ''Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World'', ed. Stanley N. Gundry, Dennis L. Okholm, and Timothy R. Phillips (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 1996), 205-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pluralists respond that Christian pluralism is not an invasive force at all, but actually arises from tensions within the Christian tradition, through a process of auto-deconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Carroll Smith, "In Defense of a Christian Pluralism," Journal for the Renewal of Religion and Theology 5 (2009), available from http://renewtheology.org/paperCSmith0709.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have pointed out similarities between Hick's theo-centrism and Hindu pluralism as propounded in the &lt;em&gt;Bhagavad Gita&lt;/em&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;By whatsoever way men worship Me, even so do I accept them; for, in all ways, O Partha, men walk in My path" (IV.11)&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, &lt;em&gt;Theology of Religion: Pluralism, Inclusivism, and Exclusivism&lt;/em&gt;, as cited by Imtitoshi Longkumer in "Issues in Mission and Evangelism in a Pluralistic Context: A New Paradigm Inquiry," &lt;em&gt;NCC Review,&lt;/em&gt; Vol. CXXXVII, No.01, Jan-Feb 2017 (Nagpur: National Council of Churches in India, 2017), p.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Another common evangelical criticism of pluralism is that the religions of the world are fundamentally and irreconcilably different.  To value them equally requires a devaluation of propositional truth claims.  It is for this reason that pluralism is often treated as a form of self-defeating relativism, though pluralists generally do not accept this label.  According to John Hick, "Religious pluralism is emphatically not a form of relativism."  Hick considers himself a [[Theological critical realism|critical realist]].&lt;ref&gt;John Hick, "Religious Pluralism and Islam," available from http://www.johnhick.org.uk/article11.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inclusivism===
[[Inclusivism]] is the belief that God is present in non-Christian religions to save adherents through Christ. The inclusivist view has given rise to the concept of the anonymous Christian by which is understood an adherent of a particular religion whom God saves through Christ, but who personally neither knows the Christ of the Bible nor has converted to Biblical Christianity. This position was popularized by the Roman Catholic theologian, [[Karl Rahner]] (b. 1904-d.1984).{{Nonspecific|date=March 2012}}

One important issue that Rahner raises is about the salvation of those who have never had the opportunity to listen to the gospel Jesus Christ. To Rahner, then, people can be saved apart from allegiance to the Christian church. It is God in Christ who reaches out to the individual in his own personal religious history to save him. Rahner used the term ‘anonymous’ to denote people who experience the grace of God in Christ regardless of what religion they belong to. Inclusivism is based on two axioms: the first is that salvation is through Christ alone, the second is that God wills the whole world to be saved.&lt;ref&gt;Based on Acts 4:12 and 1 Timothy 2: 4&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, God saves people through Christ alone; however, he makes this possible through ways that extend to all humanity.

To Rahner, a non-Christian religion is a lawful religion for until its followers have a Christian witness it is a means by which non-Christians gain a right relationship with God. Also, the religion is included in God’s plan of salvation which God has ordained for the communication of His grace.

Inclusivism has a great appeal to people because of its sympathetic approach to religion.

===Exclusivism===
Exclusivism is the theological position that holds to the finality of the Christian faith in Christ. The finality of Christ means that there is no salvation in non-Christian religions. Notable among the exclusivists of the twentieth century are [[Samuel Zwemer]], [[Hendrik Kraemer]], and [[Lesslie Newbigin]].

Based on the Aristotelian concept of truth as one and not many, exclusivists regard all other religious claims as false and invalid since the Christian revelation is accepted as true.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Gnanakan, The Pluralistic Predicament (Bangalore: TBT, 1992), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Exclusivists hold that salvation is through Christ alone. It is through a personal experience of commitment to Christ that one receives assurance of salvation. The non-believers cannot receive such assurance since they are neither aware of the uniqueness of Christ neither do they acknowledge His lordship. The exclusivist begins with the Bible as the source of all knowledge about spirituality and salvation. The Bible is the criterion of all religious truth. The Bible relates the history of redemption, gives a foundation to personal faith, is a guidebook of the Christian community, and speaks about the future of the world that links up all history, life, and service with meaning and purpose. Exclusivism, thus, establishes the uniqueness and identity of Christianity among world religions. Such exclusivism can take either an extremist or a moderate viewpoint. The extremist view regards all non-Christian religions as demonic and enemies of Christian truth.&lt;ref&gt;Emil Brunner &amp; Karl Barth, Natural Theology (London: Geoffrey Bles: The Centenary Press, 1946), pp. 74, 128&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the moderate view sees some non-Christian religions as containing elements whereby a dialogue with them can be initiated. However, all exclusivists in general agree that salvation is exclusively only through Christ and received by a personal commitment to the Lord.

An exclusivist view is inevitable in any dialogue of truth. In fact, neither the pluralist nor the inclusivist could avoid being exclusivist at some point. Truth by nature is exclusive and any claim to truth is exclusive. The only way to deny exclusiveness of Christ is to deny the veracity of the Bible. The exclusivist view sees the exclusiveness of the Bible in its proclamation of Christ as the only way of salvation, though the Bible also speaks of God involved in the history of the nations. Thus, though being very vociferous in his attacks on Hinduism, [[Nehemiah Goreh]] could say that ‘Most erroneous as is the teaching of such books as the ''Bhagvadgita,''  the ''Bhagvata'', etc., yet they teach something of ''ananyabhakti'' (undivided devotedness to God), of ''vairagya'' (giving up the world), of ''namrata'' (humility), of ''ksama'' (forbearance), etc., which enables one to appreciate the precepts of Christianity.’&lt;ref&gt;Quote from Proofs of the Divinity of Our Lord, as cited by R.H.S. Boyd in Indian Christian Theology (Delhi: ISPCK, 1969), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Hendrik Kraemer's exclusivism is based on a skepticism towards claims of similarity between religions: "Every religion is an individisble, and not to be divided". Religion "is not a series of tenets, institutions, practices that can be taken one by one as independent items of religious life".&lt;ref&gt;Hendrik Kraemer, ''The Christian Message in a Non-Christian World'' (1938), p. 40. Cited in {{cite book|author=Tim S. Perry|title=Radical Difference: A Defence of Hendrik Kraemer's Theology of Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5FBFtVH_mOwC&amp;pg=PA115|year=2001|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press|isbn=978-0-88920-377-8|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knitter's Four-Point Model==
A significant expansion of the three point model was proposed by [[Paul F. Knitter]] in his 2002 book ''Introducing Theologies of Religions''. He outlined four possible views or models that one could adopt.&lt;ref&gt; Introducing Theologies of Religions. Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books, 2002. 256 pp. {{ISBN|1-57075-419-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Replacement Model===

This tracks to the third of the three point models, i.e. Exclusivism, but is split into two subsections: Total Replacement and Partial Replacement. The Total Replacement model is most frequently found in [[Fundamentalist Christians|Fundamentalist]]/[[Evangelical]] churches, and largely represents the work of [[Karl Barth]]. It suggests that the reason the Christian religion is considered true is that it realizes that all religion is false (including itself), and recognizes that the only true belief can be found in Jesus. It does not necessarily say that there is nothing of value in other religions, but simply that there is no use in studying other religions, as everything of value can be found in Christ. The Partial Replacement model has similar things to say about other religions, but does not go so far as to say that there is nothing of value in other religions. It suggests that other religions might have access to God's revelation, but not to God's salvation. This is an important distinction, as it implies that some truth can be found in other religions, but not whole of the truth, and not enough to receive salvation. This view is largely based on the views expressed by the [[World Council of Churches]] in their discussion on religious dialogue and theology.

===The Fulfillment Model===

Knitter's main contribution, informed by his Christian faith and the idea that Christianity is a fulfillment of Judaism, implies that, while the previous religion was not wrong, it was incomplete and awaiting later fulfillment. This view is also held by some forms of Islam with respect to Christianity and Judaism before them, as well as by Mormonism and all other faiths who feel they have a later clarification from God.

However, one's religion does not have to be founded after others in order to see one's religion as a fulfillment. For instance, some Christian theologians argue that if their faith *arrives* later than the indigenous religion, even if in history Christianity came first, such indigenous systems were "God's placeholder," often with common truths learned from nature mixed with erroneous revelatory truths, that can be fulfilled and corrected with the revealed truth of the Christian Scriptures.

Proponents of this view include [[Karl Rahner]], whose appreciation of the phrase "all grace is Christ's grace" led him to the controversial theory of "anonymous Christians" - those who are already saved by the light they have, yet have not yet heard the gospel.&lt;ref&gt;Knitter, 72, 73. See also, Karl Rahner, “Christianity and the non-Christian Religions,” in Theological Investigations (Baltimore: Helicon Press, 1966) 5:115-134&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Mutuality Model===

This model admits that an admixture of truth, error, and incompleteness of revelation exists in all religions, and we need one another to understand and find the truth. While this is a type of pluralism, it does not go so far as to admit that everyone is right, or that there is no objective truth - it only admits that we must learn from one another to find it. It may be that one or another faith is wrong on even major doctrines - but it is also right and has some value in contributing to the whole. 

===The Acceptance Model===
This is Knitter's analog of pure pluralism. All paths may lead to God, and no one can affirm surely that their way is correct. We must all learn from one another, and pull back from making any absolute claims about spiritual matters. As a type of utilitarianism, it takes a subjective approach that admits that various viewpoints may work or not work for the individual, and that is the measure of truth, and any claims beyond that are speculation.

{{Other uses|TDS (disambiguation){{!}}TDS}}
'''Total dissolved solids (TDS)''' is a measure of the dissolved combined content of all [[Inorganic compound|inorganic]] and [[organic compound|organic]] substances present in a liquid in molecular, ionized or micro-granular ([[sol (colloid)|colloidal sol]]) suspended form. Generally the operational definition is that the solids must be small enough to survive filtration through a filter with two-micrometer (nominal size, or smaller) pores. Total dissolved solids are normally discussed only for freshwater systems, as [[salinity]] includes some of the ions constituting the definition of TDS. The principal application of TDS is in the study of [[water quality]] for [[stream]]s, [[river]]s and [[lake]]s, although TDS is not generally considered a primary pollutant (e.g. it is not deemed to be associated with health effects) it is used as an indication of aesthetic characteristics of [[drinking water]] and as an aggregate indicator of the presence of a broad array of chemical contaminants.

Primary sources for TDS in receiving waters are [[agriculture|agricultural]] and residential runoff, clay rich mountain waters, leaching of [[soil contamination]] and [[Point source (pollution)|point source]] [[water pollution]] discharge from industrial or [[sewage treatment]] plants. The most common chemical constituents are [[calcium]], [[phosphate]]s, [[nitrate]]s, [[sodium]], [[potassium]] and [[chloride]], which are found in [[nutrient]] runoff, general [[stormwater]] runoff and runoff from snowy climates where road [[de-icing]] salts are applied. The chemicals may be [[cation]]s, [[anion]]s, [[molecule]]s or agglomerations on the order of one thousand or fewer molecules, so long as a soluble micro-[[:wikt:granule|granule]] is formed. More exotic and harmful elements of TDS are [[pesticide]]s arising from [[surface runoff]]. Certain naturally occurring total dissolved solids arise from the weathering and dissolution of rocks and soils. The United States has established a secondary water quality standard of 500&amp;nbsp;mg/l to provide for palatability of drinking water.

Total dissolved solids are differentiated from [[total suspended solids]] ('''TSS'''), in that the latter cannot pass through a sieve of two micrometers and yet are indefinitely suspended in solution. The term "settleable solids" refers to material of any size that will not remain suspended or dissolved in a holding tank not subject to motion, and excludes both TDS and TSS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=John| last=DeZuane|title=Handbook of Drinking Water Quality|publisher=John Wiley and Sons| year=1997 |isbn=0-471-28789-X|edition= 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Settleable solids may include larger particulate matter or insoluble molecules.

==Measurement==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
The two principal methods of measuring total dissolved solids are [[gravimetric analysis]] and [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160223132222/http://www.epa.gov/quality/total-dissolved-solids-tds-epa-method-1601-gravimetric-dried-180-degrees-c |title=Total Dissolved Solids (TDS): EPA Method 160.1 (Gravimetric, Dried at 180 deg. C) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=1999-11-16 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gravimetric methods are the most accurate and involve evaporating the liquid [[solvent]] and measuring the mass of residues left. This method is generally the best, although it is time-consuming. If inorganic salts comprise the great majority of TDS, gravimetric methods are appropriate.

Electrical conductivity of water is directly related to the concentration of dissolved ionized solids in the water. Ions from the dissolved solids in water create the ability for that water to conduct an [[electric current]], which can be measured using a conventional [[EC meter|conductivity meter]] or [[TDS meter]]. When correlated with laboratory TDS measurements, [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]] provides an approximate value for the TDS [[concentration]], usually to within ten-percent accuracy.

The relationship of TDS and specific conductance of groundwater can be approximated by the following equation:

:''TDS = k&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;EC''

where TDS is expressed in mg/L and EC is the electrical conductivity in microsiemens per centimeter at 25&amp;nbsp;°C. The correlation factor ''k&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' varies between 0.55 and 0.8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Atekwanaa |first=Eliot A. |last2=Atekwanaa |first2=Estella A. |last3=Roweb |first3=Rebecca S. |last4=Werkema Jr. |first4=D.

==Hydrological simulation==
{{see also|Hydrological transport model}}
[[File:Pyramid Lake sat.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake, Nevada]] receives dissolved solids from the [[Truckee River]].]]

Hydrologic transport models are used to mathematically analyze movement of TDS within river systems. The most common models address surface runoff, allowing variation in [[land use]] type, [[topography]], [[soil]] type, [[vegetation|vegetative]] cover, [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], and land management practice (e.g. the application rate of a [[fertilizer]]). Runoff models have evolved to a good degree of accuracy and permit the evaluation of alternative land management practices upon impacts to stream water quality.

Basin models are used to more comprehensively evaluate total dissolved solids within a [[catchment basin]] and dynamically along various stream reaches. The [[DSSAM]] model was developed by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref name="hogan-papineau"&gt;C.M. Hogan, Marc Papineau et al. ''Development of a dynamic water quality simulation model for the Truckee River'', Earth Metrics Inc., Environmental Protection Agency Technology Series, Washington D.C. (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; This hydrology transport model is actually based upon the pollutant-loading metric called "[[Total Maximum Daily Load]]" (TMDL), which addresses TDS and other specific chemical pollutants. The success of this model contributed to the Agency’s broadened commitment to the use of the underlying TMDL protocol in its national policy for management of many river systems in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;EPA.

==Practical implications==
[[Image:bristol.zoo.aquarium.arp.jpg|thumb|right|Aquarium at [[Bristol Zoo|Bristol Zoo, England]]. Maintenance of filters becomes costly with high TDS.]]
When measuring water treated with [[water softener]]s, high levels of total dissolved solids do not correlate to hard water, as water softeners do not reduce TDS; rather, they replace magnesium and calcium ions, which cause hard water, with an equal charge of sodium or potassium ions, e.g. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ⇌ 2&amp;nbsp;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, leaving overall TDS unchanged&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=W. Adam Sigler |first1=Jim Bauder |title=TDS Fact Sheet |url=http://waterquality.montana.edu/docs/homeowners/tds_fact_sheet.shtml |website= |publisher=Montana State University |accessdate=23 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429145631/http://waterquality.montana.edu/docs/homeowners/tds_fact_sheet.shtml |archive-date=2015-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even increased. [[Hard water]] can cause scale buildup in pipes, [[valve]]s, and [[filter (water)|filter]]s, reducing performance and adding to system maintenance costs. These effects can be seen in [[aquarium]]s, [[destination spa|spas]], [[swimming pool]]s, and [[reverse osmosis]] [[water treatment]] systems. Typically, in these applications, total dissolved solids are tested frequently, and filtration membranes are checked in order to prevent adverse effects.

In the case of [[hydroponics]] and [[aquaculture]], TDS is often monitored in order to create a water quality environment favorable for [[organism]] productivity. For freshwater [[oyster]]s, [[trout]]s, and other high value [[seafood]], highest productivity and economic returns are achieved by mimicking the TDS and [[pH]] levels of each [[species]]' native environment. For hydroponic uses, total dissolved solids is considered one of the best indices of nutrient availability for the aquatic plants being grown.

Because the threshold of acceptable [[aesthetic]] criteria for human drinking water is 500&amp;nbsp;mg/l, there is no general concern for [[odor]], taste, and [[color]] at a level much lower than is required for harm. A number of studies have been conducted and indicate various species' reactions range from intolerance to outright toxicity due to elevated TDS. The numerical results must be interpreted cautiously, as true toxicity outcomes will relate to specific chemical constituents. Nevertheless, some numerical information is a useful guide to the nature of risks in exposing aquatic organisms or terrestrial animals to high TDS levels. Most aquatic ecosystems involving mixed fish fauna can tolerate TDS levels of 1000&amp;nbsp;mg/l.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Water Quality: An Introduction |first=Claude E. |last=Boyd |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers Group |location=The Netherlands |year=1999 |isbn=0-7923-7853-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Daphnia magna01.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Daphnia|Daphnia magna]]'' with eggs]]

The Fathead [[Leuciscinae|minnow]] (''Pimephales promelas''), for example, realizes an {{LD50}} concentration of 5600 ppm based upon a 96-hour exposure. LD50 is the concentration required to produce a lethal effect on 50&amp;nbsp;percent of the exposed [[population]]. ''[[Daphnia]] magna'', a good example of a primary member of the [[food chain]], is a small [[plankton]]ic [[crustacean]], about 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm in length, having an LD50 of about 10,000&amp;nbsp;ppm TDS for a 96-hour exposure.&lt;ref&gt;''Position Paper on Total Dissolved Solids'', State of Iowa, IAC 567 61.3 (2)g et sequitur updated March 27, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spawn (biology)|Spawning]] [[fish]]es and juveniles appear to be more sensitive to high TDS levels. For example, it was found that concentrations of 350&amp;nbsp;mg/l TDS reduced spawning of [[Striped bass]] (''Morone saxatilis'') in the [[San Francisco Bay]]-Delta region, and that concentrations below 200&amp;nbsp;mg/l promoted even healthier spawning conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser Engineers, California, ''Final Report to the State of California, San Francisco Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Program'', State of California, Sacramento, CA (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Truckee River]], EPA found that juvenile [[Lahontan cutthroat trout]] were subject to higher mortality when exposed to [[thermal pollution]] stress combined with high total dissolved solids concentrations.&lt;ref name="hogan-papineau"/&gt;

For terrestrial animals, poultry typically possess a safe upper limit of TDS exposure of approximately 2900&amp;nbsp;mg/l, whereas dairy cattle are measured to have a safe upper limit of about 7100&amp;nbsp;mg/l. Research has shown that exposure to TDS is compounded in toxicity when other [[stressor]]s are present, such as abnormal pH, high [[turbidity]], or reduced [[dissolved oxygen]] with the latter stressor acting only in the case of animalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= 	http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=9101UVQ5.txt |title=Statistical Prediction of Dynamic Thermal Equilibrium Temperatures using Standard Meteorological Data Bases |publisher=EPA |last1=Hogan |first1=C.

In countries with often-unsafe/unclean tap water supplies, such as much of India, the TDS of drinking water is often checked by technicians to gauge how effectively their RO/Water Filtration devices are working. While TDS readings will not give an answer as to the amount of microorganisms present in a sample of water, they can get a good idea as to the efficiency of the filter by how much TDS is present.

== Water classification ==
{{unsourced|section|date=October 2018}}
Water can be classified by the level of total dissolved solids (TDS) in the water:
*[[Fresh water]]:  TDS = 500 ppm
*[[Brackish water]]: TDS = 500 - 30,000 ppm
*[[Saline water]]: TDS = 30,000 - 40,000 ppm
*[[Hypersaline]]:TDS greater than 40,000 ppm
