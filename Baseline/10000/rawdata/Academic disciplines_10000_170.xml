[[File:Puits aerien knappen trans 83 00.jpg|thumb|right|High-mass air well of Belgian engineer [[Achile Knapen]] in [[Trans-en-Provence]].]]
[[File:Dew harvest satapar.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The condenser at Satapar in India consists of eleven ridges. The ridges are trapezoidal in section (top 50&amp;nbsp;cm, base 200&amp;nbsp;cm, two sides sloping 30-degree from horizontal, height 100&amp;nbsp;cm) and each is 20 m long. The ridges are built over gently sloping ground. All the ridges drain into a common pipe at the lower and leading to storage below ground. Water for use is withdrawn by a hand pump. The system was commissioned in early April 2007. Total cost of the installation was [[Rupee|Rs]] 117,000.|A {{convert|550|m2|sqyd}} radiative condenser in northwest India.{{sfn|Sharan|2007}}]]

An '''air well''' or '''aerial well''' is a structure or device that collects water by promoting the [[condensation]] of [[water vapor|moisture]] from air.{{sfn|Popular Science|1933}} Designs for air wells are many and varied, but the simplest designs are completely passive, require no external energy source and have few, if any, moving parts.

Three principal designs are used for air wells, designated as high mass, radiative, and active:
* High-mass air wells: used in the early 20th century, but the approach failed.{{sfn|Beysens|Milimouk|Nikolayev|Berkowicz|2006}} 
* Low-mass, radiative collectors: Developed in the late 20th century onwards, proved to be much more successful.{{sfn|Beysens|Milimouk|Nikolayev|Berkowicz|2006}} 
* Active collectors: these collect water in the same way as a [[dehumidifier]]; although the designs work well, they require an energy source, making them uneconomical except in special circumstances. New, innovative designs seek to minimise the energy requirements of active condensers or make use of [[renewable energy]] resources.{{sfn|Nelson|2003}}

==Background==

[[File:Atmospheric Water Vapor Mean.2005.030.jpg|thumb|right|Global atmospheric water vapor for 30 January 2005. Northern hemisphere winter and southern hemisphere summer.]]

All air well designs incorporate a substrate with a temperature sufficiently low so that [[dew]] forms. Dew is a form of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] that occurs naturally when atmospheric water vapour [[condensation|condenses]] onto a substrate. It is distinct from [[fog]], in that fog is made of droplets of water that condense around particles in the air.{{sfn|Beysens|Milimouk|2000}} Condensation releases [[latent heat]] which must be dissipated in order for water collection to continue.{{sfn|Nikolayev|Beysens|Gioda|Milimouk|1996|pp = 23–26}}

An air well requires moisture from the air. Everywhere on Earth, even in deserts, the surrounding [[atmosphere]] contains at least some water. According to Beysens and Milimouk: "The atmosphere contains [[Orders of magnitude (volume)#Terrestrial|{{nowrap|{{convert|12900|km3}}}}]] of fresh water, composed of 98 percent water vapour and 2 percent condensed water ([[cloud]]s): a figure comparable to the renewable liquid water resources of inhabited lands {{nowrap|(12,500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)}}."{{sfn|Beysens|Milimouk|2000}} The quantity of water vapour contained within the air is commonly reported as a [[relative humidity]], and this depends on temperature—warmer air can contain more water vapour than cooler air. When air is cooled to the [[dew point]], it becomes saturated, and moisture will condense on a suitable surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the dew temperature of air at {{convert|20|°C|°F}} and 80 percent relative humidity is {{convert|16|°C|°F}}. The dew temperature falls to {{convert|9|°C|°F}} if the relative humidity is 50 percent.{{sfn|Beysens|Milimouk|2000}}

A related, but quite distinct, technique of obtaining atmospheric moisture is the [[fog fence]].

An air well should not be confused with a [[dew pond]]. A dew pond is an artificial [[pond]] intended for watering livestock. The name ''dew pond'' (sometimes ''cloud pond'' or ''mist pond'') derives from the widely held belief that the pond was filled by moisture from the air.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'': "dew-pond"&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, dew ponds are primarily filled by rainwater.{{sfn|Pugsley|1939}}

A stone [[mulch]] can significantly increase crop yields in [[arid]] areas. This is most notably the case in the [[Canary Islands]]: on the island of [[Lanzarote]] there is about {{convert|140|mm|in}} of rain each year and there are no permanent rivers. Despite this, substantial crops can be grown by using a mulch of volcanic stones, a trick discovered after volcanic eruptions in 1730. Some credit the stone mulch with promoting dew; although the idea has inspired some thinkers, it seems unlikely that the effect is significant. Rather, plants are able to absorb dew directly from their leaves, and the main benefit of a stone mulch is to reduce water loss from the soil and to eliminate competition from weeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==History==

Beginning in the early 20th century, a number of inventors experimented with high-mass collectors. Notable investigators were the Russian engineer [[Friedrich Zibold]] (sometimes given as Friedrich Siebold{{sfn|Nikolayev|Beysens|Gioda|Milimouk|1996|p = 4}}), the French bioclimatologist [[Leon Chaptal]], the German-Australian researcher [[Wolf Klaphake]] and the Belgian inventor [[Achille Knapen]].

===Zibold's collector===

[[File:Zibold condenser (section).jpg|thumb|250px|A section through Zibold's dew condenser. (a) is a truncated cone of beach [[pebble]]s {{convert|20|m}} in diameter at the base and {{convert|8|m}} in diameter at the top. (b) is a concrete bowl; a pipe (not shown) leads away from the base of the bowl to a collecting point. (c) is ground level and (d) is the natural limestone base.&lt;ref&gt;Based on diagram by Nikolayev ''et all'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1900, near the site of the ancient [[Byzantine]] city of [[Feodosiya|Theodosia]], thirteen large piles of stones were discovered by Zibold who was a [[forester]] and engineer in charge of this area.{{sfn|Nikolayev|Beysens|Gioda|Milimouk|1996|pp = 20–23}} Each stone pile covered just over {{convert|900|m2}} and was about {{convert|10|m}} tall. The finds were associated with the remains of {{convert|75|mm|in|adj=mid|diameter}} [[terracotta]] pipes that apparently led to wells and fountains in the city. Zibold concluded that the stacks of stone were condensers that supplied Theodosia with water; and calculated that each air well produced more than {{convert|55400|l}} each day.{{sfn|Nikolayev|Beysens|Gioda|Milimouk|1996|p = 4}}

To verify his hypothesis Zibold constructed a stone-pile condenser at an altitude of {{convert|288|m}} on mount Tepe-Oba near the ancient site of Theodosia. Zibold's condenser was surrounded by a wall {{convert|1|m}} high, {{convert|20|m}} wide, around a bowl-shaped collection area with drainage. He used sea stones {{convert|10|-|40|cm|in}} in diameter piled {{convert|6|m}} high in a truncated cone that was {{convert|8|m}} in diameter across the top. The shape of the stone pile allowed a good air flow with only minimal thermal contact between the stones.{{sfn|Nelson|2003}}

Zibold's condenser began to operate in 1912 with a maximum daily production that was later estimated to have been {{convert|360|l}} – Zibold made no public record of his results at the time.{{sfn|Nikolayev|Beysens|Gioda|Milimouk|1996|p = 4}} The base developed leaks that forced the experiment to end in 1915 and the site was partially dismantled before being abandoned. (The site was rediscovered in 1993 and cleaned up.){{sfn|Nelson|2003}} Zibold's condenser was approximately the same size as the ancient stone piles that had been found,{{sfn|Nelson|2003}} and although the yield was very much less than the yield Zibold had calculated for the original structures, the experiment was an inspiration for later developers.

===Chaptal's collector===

Inspired by Zibold's work, Chaptal built a small air well near [[Montpellier]] in 1929. Chaptal's condenser was a [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramidal]] concrete structure {{convert|3|m}} square and {{convert|2.5|m}} high, it was filled with {{convert|8|m3}} of [[limestone]] pieces being about {{convert|7.5|cm}} in diameter. Small vent holes ringed the top and bottom of the pyramid. These holes could be closed or opened as required to control the flow of air. The structure was allowed to cool during the night, and then warm moist air was let in during the day. Dew formed on the limestone pieces and collected in a reservoir below ground level. The amount of water obtained varied from {{convert|1|l}} to {{convert|2.5|l}} per day depending on the atmospheric conditions.{{sfn|Hills|1966|p = 232}}

Chaptal did not consider his experiment a success. When he retired in 1946, he put the condenser out of order, possibly because he did not want to leave an improper installation to mislead those who might later continue studies on air wells.{{sfn|Beysens|Milimouk|Nikolayev|Berkowicz|2006}}

===Klaphake's collectors===

[[Wolf Klaphake]] was a successful chemist working in Berlin during the 1920s and 1930s. During that time, he tested several forms of air wells in [[Yugoslavia]] and on [[Vis (island)|Vis Island]] in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Klaphake's work was inspired by Zibold{{sfn|Klaphake|1936}} and by the works of [[Maimonides]], a known Jewish scholar who wrote in Arabic about 1,000 years ago and who mentioned the use of water condensers in Palestine.{{sfn|Nelson|2003}}

Klaphake experimented with a very simple design: an area of mountain slope was cleared and smoothed with a watertight surface. It was shaded by a simple canopy supported by pillars or ridges. The sides of the structure were closed, but the top and bottom edges were left open. At night the mountain slope would cool, and in the day moisture would collect on and run down the smoothed surface. Although the system apparently worked, it was expensive, and Klaphake finally adopted a more compact design based on a masonry structure. This design was a [[sugarloaf]]-shaped building, about {{convert|15|m}} high, with walls at least {{convert|2|m|sigfig=1}} thick, with holes on the top and at the bottom. The outer wall was made of concrete to give a high thermal capacity, and the inner surface was made of a porous material such as sandstone.{{sfn|Sharan|2006|p = 72}} According to Klaphake:

{{cquote|The building produces water during the day and cools itself during the night; when the sun rises, the warm air is drawn through the upper holes into the building by the out-flowing cooler air, becomes cooled on the cold surface, deposits its water, which then oozes down and is collected somewhere underneath. It is wrong to think that this process works only on days with dew, as the inner surface becomes much cooler than one should expect. In Dalmatia, that day was a rare exception which failed to produce water.{{sfn|Klaphake|1936}} }}

Traces of Klaphake's condensers have been tentatively identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1935, Wolf Klaphake and his wife Maria emigrated to Australia. The Klaphakes' decision to emigrate was probably primarily the result of Maria's encounters with Nazi authorities;{{sfn|Neumann|2002|p = 7}}&lt;ref name="uncommon lives2"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; their decision to settle in Australia (rather than, say, in Britain) was influenced by Wolf's desire to develop a dew condenser.&lt;ref name="uncommon lives2" /&gt; As a dry continent, Australia was likely to need alternative sources of fresh water, and the Premier of [[South Australia]], whom he had met in London, had expressed an interest. Klaphake made a specific proposal for a condenser at the small town of [[Cook, South Australia|Cook]], where there was no supply of potable water. At Cook, the railway company had previously installed a large coal-powered active condenser,&lt;ref name="cook condenser"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1930, Knapen's dew tower took 18 months to build; it still stands today, albeit in dilapidated condition. At the time of its construction, the condenser excited some public interest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oygDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1933+plane+%22Popular+Science%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_P1UTf6QMYH-8Abd79mOBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Popular%20Science%201933%20plane%20%22Popular%20Science%22&amp;f=true "Air Well Waters Parched Farms"] ''Popular Science'', March 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

The tower is {{convert|14|m}} high and has massive masonry walls about {{convert|3|m}} thick with a number of apertures to let in air. Inside there is a massive column made of concrete. At night, the whole structure is allowed to cool, and during the day warm moist air enters the structure via the high apertures, cools, descends, and leaves the building by the lower apertures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knapen's intention was that water should condense on the cool inner column. In keeping with Chaptal's finding that the condensing surface must be rough and the surface tension must be sufficiently low that the condensed water can drip, the central column's outer surface was studded with projecting plates of [[slate]]. The slates were placed nearly vertically to encourage dripping down to a collecting basin at the bottom of the structure.{{sfn|Nelson|2003}} Unfortunately, the aerial well never achieved anything like its hoped-for performance and produced no more than a few litres of water each day.{{sfn|Sharan|2006|p = 70}}

[[File:Dr Sharan at condenser test ground.JPG|thumb|left|A radiative dew condenser test site at village Kothar in the north-west India near Arabian sea coast.]]

By the end of the twentieth century, the mechanics of how dew condenses were much better understood. The key insight was that low-mass collectors which rapidly lose heat by [[thermal radiation|radiation]] perform best. A number of researchers worked on this method.{{sfn|Sharan|2006|p = 22}} In the early 1960s, dew condensers made from sheets of [[polyethylene]] supported on a simple frame resembling a ridge tent were used in Israel to irrigate plants. Saplings supplied with dew and very slight rainfall from these collectors survived much better than the control group planted without such aids&amp;nbsp;– they all dried up over the summer.{{sfn|Gindel|1965}} In 1986 in [[New Mexico]] condensers made of a special foil produced sufficient water to supply young saplings.{{sfn|Beysens|Milimouk|2000}}

In 1992 a party of French academics attended a [[condensed matter]] conference in [[Ukraine]] where [[physicist]] Daniel Beysens introduced them to the story of how ancient Theodosia was supplied with water from dew condensers. They were sufficiently intrigued that in 1993 they went to see for themselves. They concluded that the mounds that Zibold identified as dew condensers were in fact [[tumulus|ancient burial mounds]] (a part of the [[necropolis]] of ancient Theodosia) and that the pipes were medieval in origin and not associated with the construction of the mounds. They found the remains of Zibold's condenser, which they tidied up and examined closely. Zibold's condenser had apparently performed reasonably well, but in fact his exact results are not at all clear, and it is possible that the collector was intercepting fog, which added significantly to the yield.{{sfn|Nikolayev|Beysens|Gioda|Milimouk|1996|p = 4}} If Zibold's condenser worked at all, this was probably due to fact that a few stones near the surface of the mound were able to lose heat at night while being thermally isolated from the ground; however, it could never have produced the yield that Zibold envisaged.{{sfn|Beysens|Milimouk|Nikolayev|Berkowicz|2006}}{{sfn|Nikolayev|Beysens|Gioda|Milimouk|1996}}

Fired with enthusiasm, the party returned to France and set up the ''International Organisation for Dew Utilization'' (OPUR), with the specific objective of making dew available as an alternative source of water.&lt;ref name="opur.fr"&gt;{{cite web

OPUR began a study of dew condensation under laboratory conditions; they developed a special [[hydrophobic]] film and experimented with trial installations, including a {{convert|30|m2|sqft}} collector in [[Corsica]].{{sfn|Muselli|Beysens|Milimouk|2006}} Vital insights included the idea that the [[thermal mass|mass]] of the condensing surface should be as low as possible so that it cannot easily retain heat, that it should be protected from unwanted thermal radiation by a layer of [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], and that it should be hydrophobic, so as to shed condensed moisture readily.{{sfn|Sharan|2006|pp = 20–28}}

By the time they were ready for their first practical installation, they heard that one of their members, Girja Sharan, had obtained a grant to construct a dew condenser in Kothara, India. In April 2001, Sharan had incidentally noticed substantial condensation on the roof of a cottage at [[Toran]] Beach Resort in the arid coastal region of [[Kutch]], where he was briefly staying. The following year, he investigated the phenomenon more closely and interviewed local people. Financed by the Gujarat Energy Development Agency and the [[World Bank]], Sharan and his team went on to develop passive, radiative condensers for use in the arid coastal region of Kutch.{{sfn|Sharan|2006|loc = Acknowledgement section}} Active commercialisation began in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Sharan tested a wide range of materials and got good results from [[galvanised iron]] and [[aluminium]] sheets, but found that sheets of the special plastic developed by the OPUR just {{convert|400|um}} thick generally worked even better than the metal sheets and were less expensive.{{sfn|Sharan|2006|p = 27}} The plastic film, known as OPUR foil, is hydrophilic and is made from polyethylene mixed with [[titanium dioxide]]&lt;!--Sharan is ambiguous with "titanium oxide" but the source at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0169-8095(02)00100-X says it's titanium dioxide--&gt; and [[barium sulphate]].

==Types==

There are three principal approaches to the design of the heat sinks that collect the moisture in air wells: high mass, radiative and active. Early in the twentieth century, there was interest in high-mass air wells, but despite much experimentation including the construction of massive structures, this approach proved to be a failure.{{sfn|Alton Stewart|Howell|2003|p = 1014}}

From the late twentieth century onwards, there has been much investigation of low-mass, [[thermal radiation|radiative]] collectors; these have proved to be much more successful.

===High-mass===

The high-mass air well design attempts to cool a large mass of masonry with cool nighttime air entering the structure due to breezes or natural convection. In the day, the warmth of the sun results in increased atmospheric humidity. When moist daytime air enters the air well, it condenses on the presumably cool masonry. None of the high-mass collectors performed well, Knapen's aerial well being a particularly conspicuous example.

The problem with the high-mass collectors was that they could not get rid of sufficient heat during the night&amp;nbsp;– despite design features intended to ensure that this would happen.{{sfn|Nelson|2003}} While some thinkers have believed that Zibold might have been correct after all,&lt;ref name="popular science 1992"&gt;{{cite journal

{{cquote|We would like to stress the following point. To obtain condensation, the condenser temperature of the stones must be lower than the dew point temperature. When there is no fog, the dew point temperature is always lower than the air temperature. Meteorological data shows that the dew point temperature (an indicator of the water content of the air) does not change appreciably when the weather is stable. ''Thus wind, which ultimately imposes air temperature to the condenser, cannot cool the condenser to ensure its functioning.'' Another cooling phenomenon&amp;nbsp;— radiative cooling&amp;nbsp;— must operate. It is therefore at night-time, when the condenser cools by radiation, that liquid water can be extracted from air. It is very rare that the dew point temperature would increase significantly so as to exceed the stone temperature inside the stone heap. Occasionally, when this does happen, dew can be abundant during a short period of time. This is why subsequent attempts by L. Chaptal and A. Knapen to build massive dew condensers only rarely resulted in significant yields. [Emphasis as in original]{{sfn|Beysens|Milimouk|Nikolayev|Berkowicz|2006}} }}

Although ancient air wells are mentioned in some sources, there is scant evidence for them, and persistent belief in their existence has the character of a [[Urban legend|modern myth]].{{sfn|Beysens|Milimouk|Nikolayev|Berkowicz|2006}}

===Radiative===

[[File:Dew water from metal roofs.jpg|thumb|right|Structures with metal roofing, such as this one, can be used to harvest dew water simply by adding gutters and, for increased output, a layer of insulation underside.

This installation is on school buildings at Sayara (Kutch, India). Unlike metal roofs, concrete roofs do not attract condensation without any treatment, hence the need for an external condenser. The output from such condensers is nearly two times higher than from a bare metal roof, all else remaining constant.]]

A radiative air well is designed to cool a substrate by [[thermal radiation|radiating heat]] to the night sky. The substrate has a low mass so that it cannot hold onto heat, and it is thermally isolated from any mass, including the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; A typical radiative collector presents a condensing surface at an angle of 30° from the horizontal. The condensing surface is backed by a thick layer of insulating material such as [[polystyrene foam]] and supported {{convert|2|-|3|m|ft|sigfig=1}} above ground level. Such condensers may be conveniently installed on the ridge roofs of low buildings or supported by a simple frame.{{sfn|Sharan|2006|pp = 20–39}} Although other heights do not typically work quite so well, it may be less expensive or more convenient to mount a collector near to ground level or on a two-story building.{{sfn|Sharan|2006|pp = 40–59}}

The {{convert|600|m2}} radiative condenser illustrated near the start of this article is built near the ground. In the area of north-west India where it is installed dew occurs for 8 months a year, and the installation collects about {{convert|15|mm}} of dew water over the season with nearly 100 dew-nights. In a year it provides a total of about {{convert|9000|l}} of [[Drinking water|potable water]] for the school which owns and operates the site.{{sfn|Sharan|2007}}

Although flat designs have the benefit of simplicity, other designs such as inverted pyramids and cones can be significantly more effective. This is probably because the designs shield the condensing surfaces from unwanted heat radiated by the lower atmosphere, and, being symmetrical, they are not sensitive to wind direction.{{sfn|Clus|Ouazzani|Muselli|Nikolayev|2006}}

New materials may make even better collectors.{{sfn|Sharan|2006|p = 20}} One such material is inspired by the [[Namib Desert beetle]], which survives only on the moisture it extracts from the atmosphere. It has been found that its back is coated with microscopic projections: the peaks are hydrophilic and the troughs are hydrophobic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

{{main|Atmospheric water generator}}

Active atmospheric water collectors have been in use since the commercialisation of mechanical [[refrigeration]]. Essentially, all that is required is to cool a [[heat exchanger]] below the dew point, and water will be produced. Such water production may take place as a [[by-product]], possibly unwanted, of [[Dehumidifier|dehumidification]].{{sfn|Nelson|2003}} The air conditioning system of the [[Burj Khalifa]] in [[Dubai]], for example, produces an estimated {{convert|15|e6USgal|m3}} of water each year that is used for irrigating the tower's landscape plantings.&lt;ref name="gn"&gt;{{cite news

Because mechanical refrigeration is energy intensive, active collectors are typically restricted to places where there is no supply of water that can be [[desalination|desalinated]] or purified at a lower cost and that are sufficiently far from a supply of fresh water to make transport uneconomical. Such circumstances are uncommon, and even then large installations such as that tried in the 1930s at Cook in South Australia failed because of the cost of running the installation – it was cheaper to transport water over large distances.&lt;ref name="uncommon lives3" /&gt;

In the case of small installations, convenience may outweigh cost. There is a wide range of small machines designed to be used in offices that produce a few litres of drinking water from the atmosphere. However, there are circumstances where there really is no source of water other than the atmosphere. For example, in the 1930s, American designers added condenser systems to [[airships]]&amp;nbsp;– in this case the air was that emitted by the exhaust of the engines, and so it contained additional water as a product of combustion. The moisture was collected and used as additional ballast to compensate for the loss of weight as fuel was consumed. By collecting ballast in this way, the airship's buoyancy could be kept relatively constant without having to release helium gas, which was both expensive and in limited supply.{{sfn|Allen|1931|p = 37}}

More recently, on the [[International Space Station]], the [[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda module]] includes a humidity control system. The water it collects is usually used to supply the [[ISS ECLSS#Elektron|Elektron]] system that electrolyses water into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]], but it can be used for drinking in an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There are a number of designs that minimise the energy requirements of active condensers:

* One method is to use the ground as a [[heat sink]] by drawing air through underground pipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; This is often done to provide a source of cool air for a building by means of a [[ground-coupled heat exchanger]] (also known as ''Earth tubes''), wherein condensation is typically regarded as a significant problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A major problem with such designs is that the underground tubes are subject to contamination and difficult to keep clean. Designs of this type require air to be drawn through the pipes by a fan, but the power required may be provided (or supplemented) by a [[wind turbine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference

* Cold seawater is used in the [[Seawater Greenhouse]] to both cool and humidify the interior of [[greenhouse]]-like structure. The cooling can be so effective that not only do the plants inside benefit from reduced [[transpiration]], but dew collects on the outside of the structure and can easily be collected by gutters.{{sfn|Beysens|Milimouk|2000}}
* Another type of atmospheric water collector makes use of [[desiccant]]s which adsorb atmospheric water at ambient temperature, this makes it possible to extract moisture even when the relative humidity is as low as 14 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Cartlidge|2009|pp = 26–27}} For regeneration, the desiccant needs to be heated.{{sfn|Cartlidge|2009|p = 16}} In some designs regeneration energy is supplied by the sun; air is ventilated at night over a bed of desiccants that adsorb the water vapour.

In later Roman versions, only the ridiculous characters read their lines in Oscan, while the others used Latin.

==History==
Atellan Farce evidence is scarce, but surviving fragments point to the comedy genre coming about no earlier than 90 BC.&lt;ref&gt;W.Beare Cambridge University Press, Platus and the Fabula Atellana&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Stock characters==
Some of the hypothesized [[stock character]]s included:
* '''Maccus''' ("The Fool", a hunchbacked, beak nosed character)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Commedia Dell'Arte|last=Smith|first=Winifred|publisher=Benjamin Bloom|year=1964|isbn=|location=New York|pages=22|quote=A grotesque statuette representing a beak-nosed, hunchbacked individual, was unearthed at Herculaneum in 1727, which by a slight stretch of imagination could be identified with Maccus|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Punch and Judy: Its Origin and Evolution|last=Byrom|first=Michael|publisher=Shiva Publications|year=1972|isbn=0902982028|location=Aberdeen|pages=4|quote=There was the old man (Pappus), the old woman, the comic slave (Centunculus), the country booby (Buccus), the arrogant soldier (Manducus), the pompous doctor (Dossenus), and the sharp-tongued hooked nosed hunchback (Maccus).|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Buccus''' (the country booby)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Manducus''' (the arrogant soldier)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Pappus''' (the old man)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Centunculus''' (the comic slave) &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Dosseunus''' (the pompous doctor) &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
There has been some debate of these characters connection to similar stock characters in [[Commedia dell'arte]], as well as [[Punch and Judy]]. Atellan Farce and Commedia were both improvised masked comedies. Some Historians argue that the stock characters in Atellan Farce are the beginnings of what would become the stock characters of Commedia dell'arte.

Some of the theorized character progressions are as follows:
* '''Pappus''' → [[Pantalone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Italian Comedy|last=Duchartre|first=Peirre|publisher=Dover Publications, INC|year=1966|isbn=|location=New York|pages=17|quote=The ancestor of Pantaloon, and his son Harpagon, is Pappus, the lecherous old miser of the Antellane|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Commedia dell'Arte|last=Oreglia|first=Giacomo|publisher=Hill and Wang|year=1968|isbn=|location=New York|pages=78|quote=In the ancient theatre the characters which recall this Mask are those of the various old men of Aristophanes, Plautus, Terence, and the Pappus of the Atella comedies|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Maccus+Buccu'''s → [[Pulcinella]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Italian Comedy|last=Duchartre|first=Pierre|publisher=The Dover Publications, INC|year=1966|isbn=|location=New York|pages=18|quote=The cradle of the family was the ancient city of Atella, in the Roman Campangna, and the gallery of ancestors shows, among others Bucco and the sensual Maccus, whose lean figure and cowardly nature reappear in Pulcinella|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Italian Comedy|last=Duchartre|first=Pierre|publisher=Dover Publication, INC|year=1966|isbn=|location=|pages=29|quote=Pulcinella was always dressed in white like Maccus, the mimus albus, or white mime|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Manducus''' → [[il Capitano]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Italian Comedy|last=Duchartre|first=Pierre|publisher=The Dover Publications, INC|year=1966|isbn=|location=New York|pages=18|quote=Next there is the ogre Manducus, the Miles Glorious in the plays of Plautus, who is later metamorphosed into the swaggering Captain, or Captain.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the connection of Atellan Farce to Commedia dell'arte and assumption that Atellan Farce is the precursor to Commedia dell'arte is still under debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Commedia Dell'Arte|last=Smith|first=Winifred|publisher=Benjamin Blom|year=1964|isbn=|location=New York|pages=21|quote=page 21 Not a little nonsense has been written about the “evolution” of the commedai dell’arte. Of the three main theories that attempt to account for our farces the hoariest and most outgrown is that concerning their putative Roman father, surely a ghost that by now ought to be permately laid.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for Atellan Farce's connection to Punch and Judy, the similarities between Punch and the Commedia dell'arte character Pulcinella are notable. However, many historians still debate whether or not Punch's derivation can be traced back to Pulcinella.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Commedia Dell'Arte|last=Smith|first=Winifred|publisher=Benjamin Blom|year=1964|isbn=|location=New York|pages=23|quote=The identification of the statuette with a future in the Mimes or even with a stage character at all is very uncertain, nor is it safe to press its resemblance to the English Punch; there is no doubt that it looks like Punch but this, I think, is vest explained by the fame of the figure at the time of its discovery and by the influence of its peculiarities on the face and figure of the English villain-clown.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Punch and Judy: Its Origin and Evolution|last=Byrom|first=Michael|publisher=Shiva Publications|year=1972|isbn=0902982028|location=Aberbeen|pages=5|quote=In 1662, Pulcinella crossed the English Channel and became 'Punchinello' later to be known simply as Punch.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
At first, the subjects were decided upon before the performance began and the dialogue was improvised as it proceeded. The performers were the sons of Roman citizens, who did not lose their rights as citizens, and were allowed to serve in the army: professional actors were excluded. The simple prose dialogues were probably varied by songs in the rude Saturnian metre: the language was that of the common people, accompanied by lively gesticulation and movements. They were characterized by coarseness and obscenity.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Atellanae Fabulae|volume=2|page=824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, it is believed that the dictator [[Sulla]] wrote some Atellan Fables. [[Quintus Novius]], who flourished 50 years after the abdication of Sulla, wrote some fifty, including ''Macchus Sexul'' ("Exiled Macchus"), ''Gallinaria'' ("The Henhouse"), ''Surdus'' ("The Deaf One"), ''Vindemiatores'' ("The Harvesters"), and ''Parcus'' (“The Treasurer”).

[[Lucius Pomponius]], of [[Bologna]], is known to have composed a few, including ''Macchus Miles'' ("Macchus the Soldier"),  ''Pytho Gorgonius'', ''Pseudoagamemnon'', ''Bucco Adoptatus'', and ''Aeditumus''. He was also said to have been influenced by the Palliata [[Fabius Dorsennus]]. [[Quintus Novius]] and a "Memmius" were also authors of these comedies; [[Ovid]] and [[Pliny the Younger]] found the work of Memmius to be indecent.

==Controversy and suppression==
{{Citation needed|reason=I have not found any other source other than Wikipedia itself stating this information about the Atellan Farces becoming illegal |date=July 2018}}
Taken from [[Tacitus]] ( [[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]], Book 4): "...after various and often fruitless complaints from the praetors, the emperor [[Tiberius]] finally brought forward a motion about the licentious behavior of the players.  'They had often,' he said.  'Sought to disturb the public peace, and to bring disgrace on private families, and the old Oscan farce, once a wretched amusement for the vulgar, had become at once so indecent and popular, that it must be checked by the Senate's authority'.  The players, upon this, were banished from Italy".

[[Suetonius]] ('' [[The Twelve Caesars#Tiberius|Tiberius]]'', 45, 1) reports that Tiberius himself was mocked for his lecherous habits in an Atellan farce, after which the saying "the old goat lapping up the doe" (''hircum vetulum capreis naturam ligurire'') became popular.

The above passage suggests a growth in popularity or maybe even a revival of these farces, in the 20s AD, that met the disapproval of an older generation of patricians and senators.  Perhaps they were even performed out in public places as an act of direct hostility towards (or a means to mock) specific people or families.  At any rate, these performances eventually became so obnoxious that, in 28 AD, all those who performed in these farces were banished from Italy.

The ''[[Augustan History]]'' records that [[Hadrian]] furnished performances of Atellan Farces at banquets.&lt;ref&gt;''HA'' Hadrian 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1950s, there was an increasing focus on the global need for anthropological research into 'disappearing cultures'.&lt;ref&gt;''International Social Science Bulletin: Disappearing Cultures'', vol 9, No 3, 1957, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Paris. http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0002/000247/024733eo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heine-Geldern, R (1959), 'The International Committee on Urgent Anthropological and Ethnological Research', ''American Anthropologist'', 61: 1076–1078. doi: 10.1525/aa.1959.61.6.02a00130&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was also emerging in Australia in the work of researchers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples,&lt;ref&gt;Berndt, RM (1959), ‘Areas of research in Aboriginal Australia which demand urgent attention’, ''Bulletin of the International Committee on Urgent Anthropological and Ethnological Research'', Vienna, vol. 2, pp 63–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strehlow, TGH (1959), ‘Anthropological and ethnological research in Australia’, ''Bulletin of the International Committee on Urgent Anthropological and Ethnological Research'', Vienna, vol 2, pp 70–5&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a proposal by [[William Wentworth (Australian politician)|W.C. Wentworth MP]] for the conception of an Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies (AIAS) in 1959.&lt;ref name="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75"&gt;Mulvaney, DJ (2008), 'WEH Stanner and the foundation of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, 1959–1964', p 58-75, in: ''An Appreciation of Difference: WEH Stanner and Aboriginal Australia'', Hinkson, Melinda and Beckett, Jeremy (eds), Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal was made as a submission to Cabinet,&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002"&gt;Bryson, Ian (2002), ‘Aborigines, film and science’, ''Bringing to Light: a history of ethnographic filmmaking at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies'', Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra, pp 9–17&lt;/ref&gt; and argued for a more comprehensive approach by the Australian Government to the recording of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and cultures.&lt;ref name="Wentworth Lecture"&gt;'Wentworth Lectures', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/news-and-events/events/special-events/wentworth-lectures, retrieved 24 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, a Cabinet sub-committee assessed the proposal&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988"&gt;Chapman, Valerie (1988), 'The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies', ''Resources for Australian Studies in the ACT'', Biskup, Peter &amp; Goodman, Doreen (eds), Centre for Library and Information Studies, CCAE, pp194-214&lt;/ref&gt; and formed a working party at the [[Australian National University]] (ANU) to consider the viability of the proposal.  One of their first actions was to appoint [[William Edward Hanley Stanner|W.E.H. Stanner]] to organise a conference on the state of Aboriginal Studies in Australia,&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt; to be held in 1961 at the ANU.

Academics and anthropologists in the field of Aboriginal Studies attended the conference,&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt; and contributed research papers published in a conference report in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Shiels, H (ed) 1963, ''Australian Aboriginal Studies: A Symposium of Papers at 1961 Research Conference'', Oxford University Press, Melbourne&lt;/ref&gt; No Aboriginal people were present at the conference.&lt;ref name="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75" /&gt;

The Prime Minister, [[Robert Menzies]] appointed an Interim Council in 1961.  The role of the Interim Council was to plan for a national Aboriginal research organisation and establish how this organisation would interact with existing research and scientific bodies.&lt;ref name="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75" /&gt; The Interim Council was also tasked with immediately developing a programme that would identify and address urgent research needs.&lt;ref name="AIAS Details,NAA"&gt;'Australian Institute for Aboriginal Studies Agency Details', National Archives of Australia, www.naa.gov.au, retrieved 28 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Interim Council consisted of 16 members and was chaired by Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the ANU, Professor AD Trendall,&lt;ref name ="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75" /&gt; officially recognised as the first Chair of the institute now known as AIATSIS.&lt;ref name="Chairs and Principals"&gt;'Chairs and Principals of AIATSIS', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/about-us/governance-and-structure/executive/chairs-and-principals {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316112934/http://aiatsis.gov.au/about-us/governance-and-structure/executive/chairs-and-principals |date=16 March 2015 }}, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1962, a draft constitution for the institute was submitted to the Menzies government, and rejected. The Interim Council completed a revised constitution in July 1963. Amendments to the document included the change from the title ‘director’ to ‘principal’ of the institute.

This version of the constitution would go on to form the basis for the creation of the new Australian Institute for Aboriginal Studies the following year.&lt;ref name ="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75" /&gt;

===AIAS early years (1964–1970)===
The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies was established as a [[Statutory authority]]&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies: Independent Review', ''Final Report to the Department of Education'', May 2014, p (i), http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/about-us/review-of-aiatsis-full-report-2014.pdf, retrieved 17 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; under an Act of Parliament in June 1964.&lt;ref name="Our history"&gt;'Our history', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/about-us/our-history, retrieved 17 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Interim Council for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies Agency Details', National Archives of Australia website, www.naa.gov.au,  retrieved 28 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the Institute at that time has been described as "to record language, song, art, material culture, ceremonial life and social structure before those traditions perished in the face of European ways."&lt;ref name="antiquity.ac.uk"&gt;Mulvaney, D. J. 'Reflections', ''Antiquity'', Vol. 80, no. 308, June 2006, pp 425–434, http://antiquity.ac.uk/Ant/080/0425/ant0800425.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

This notion is also reflected in the Institute’s official functions, as recorded in the Reading of the Bill in Parliament. These were:

:(a)	to sponsor and to foster research of a scientific nature on the Australian Aborigines.

:(b)	to treat as a matter of urgency those studies for which the source materials are disappearing.

:(c)	to establish and conduct a documentation centre on the Aborigines, and a library of books, manuscripts and other relevant material, both for the use of scholars and for public education.

:(d)	to encourage co-operation with and between scholars in universities, museums, and other institutions engaged in studies of the Aborigines, and with appropriate private bodies.

:(e)	to publish and to support the publication of the results of research.

:(f)	to co-operate with appropriate bodies concerning the financing of research, the preservation of sites, and the collection of records.

:(g)	to promote as and when necessary the training of research workers.

:(h)	to establish and maintain relations with relevant international bodies.&lt;ref name="AIAS Details,NAA" /&gt;

AIAS had a twenty-two member Council, composed mainly of academics, and had a foundation membership of one hundred.&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt; The founding Principal of the newly formed institute was [[Frederick McCarthy]],&lt;ref name="Chairs and Principals"/&gt; a professional anthropologist and graduate of Sydney University who had spent nearly 30 years working in the field.&lt;ref&gt;'Fred McCarthy: the founding principal of AIATSIS', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, {{cite web |url=http://www.aiatsis.gov.au/corporate/mccarthy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028055915/http://www.aiatsis.gov.au/corporate/mccarthy.html |archivedate=28 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}, retrieved 28 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the AIAS provided an opportunity for greater cross-discipline interaction in fields relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies in Australia.&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt;

The Institute’s founding principal, Fred McCarthy, was an advocate of film as an important part of research methodology as early as his tenure as curator of anthropology at the Australian Museum in Sydney in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt; This was evident in the contributions he made during his involvement in establishing the AIAS and also as its principal, in continuing to support the development of the AIAS Film Unit&lt;ref name="Bryson,Capturing a changing culture,2002"&gt;Bryson, Ian (2002), ‘Capturing a changing culture: The first phase of the Film Unit’ , ''Bringing to Light: a history of ethnographic filmmaking at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies'', Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra, p 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; and championing ethnographic film in global forums.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt;

In the early years of the AIAS, the Film Unit largely outsourced early filmmaking work to other companies,&lt;ref name="Bryson,Capturing a changing culture,2002" /&gt; or worked in collaboration with the [[Commonwealth Film Unit]] (as early as 1962).&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Australian Ethnographic Film', Australian Screen Online website, http://aso.gov.au/titles/collections/ethnographic-film-in-Australia/, retrieved 28 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; But over the next 30 years, the Film Unit would go on to produce “one of the largest assembly of ethnographic films created in the world”.&lt;ref&gt;'AIATSIS Collections: Film', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/film, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with the AIAS official function “to publish and to support the publication of the results of research”,&lt;ref name="AIAS Details,NAA" /&gt; a publishing arm of the Institute was established in 1964. Publishing under the name Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, the publishing arm released a range of papers and research findings, including in the fields of linguistics, demography, physical anthropology, history and musicology.&lt;ref&gt;Elkin, AP, 'The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies: Publications', in Oceania, Vol. 41, No. 1 (Sep. 1970), pp. 52–57, https://www.jstor.org/stable/40329899, retrieved 10 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The early work of the AIAS is credited with increasing interaction between academics in different fields, as well as establishing the foundations for the extensive collections AIATSIS holds today. But before 1970, there had never been an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander member on the AIAS Council.&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt;

===Self-determination and the Institute (1970–1989)===
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Money and other resources are in short supply for Aboriginal control of their livelihood, but not, it seems, for discussing it."'' – Eaglehawk and Crow letter, 29 March 1974&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The 1970s marked a period of change for the AIAS. This began with the appointment of the first Aboriginal member of the AIAS Council in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Jacqueline, ''A History of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies 1959 -1989: An analysis of how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people achieved control of a national research institute'', thesis submitted for the Doctor of Philosophy, Menzies Library, Australian National University, November 2011, p106&lt;/ref&gt; Phillip Roberts, an Alawa man,&lt;ref&gt;‘Indigenous Rights: Phillip Roberts’, National Museum of Australia website, http://www.nma.gov.au/indigenous/people/pagination/phillip_roberts, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pilling, A. R. (1963), '‘I, the Aboriginal’, Douglas Lockwood', ''American Anthropologist'', 65: 1152–1153. doi: 10.1525/aa.1963.65.5.02a00280&lt;/ref&gt; served on the Council from September 1970 until June 1972.&lt;ref name="Lambert 2011, p106"&gt;Lambert 2011, p106&lt;/ref&gt;

This was followed in 1971 with a second Aboriginal Council member, [[Neville Bonner|Senator Neville Bonner]], who served on Council until 1974 and for a second term in the late 1970s. And again in 1972, with the appointment of [[Dick Roughsey]] to replace Phillip Roberts at the end of his term.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p128&lt;/ref&gt;

The appointment of Phillip Roberts to the Council reflected a growing pressure for an increase in Aboriginal representation within the Institute.&lt;ref name="Lambert 2011, p106"/&gt; But the move did not allay the belief held by some Aboriginal activists that the AIAS was engaging in 'tokenism' in the extent to which Aboriginal people were involved in the administration of Aboriginal Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Widders, Thompson, Bellear &amp; Watson (1974), ''Eaglehawk and Crow: an open letter concerning the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies'', 29 March, AIAS, cited in Lambert 2011, p142&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes to the Institute that would take place in the following decade were also influenced by the shifting social and political landscape in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p107&lt;/ref&gt; The Aboriginal rights movement was growing&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt; and Aboriginal people were demanding a voice on Council, consultation with communities and an increased focus on projects relevant to the needs of Indigenous people.&lt;ref name="antiquity.ac.uk"/&gt;

In 1972, the Whitlam government was elected. Their policy of [[Self-determination of Australian Aborigines|Self-determination for Aboriginal people]] echoed calls for greater Aboriginal involvement in the administration and functions of the AIAS.&lt;ref&gt;Rolls, Mitchell &amp; Johnson, Murray, ''Historical Dictionary of Australian Aborigines'', Scarecrow Press, Maryland, 2011, p xxv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aph.gov.au"&gt;Pratt, Angela, 'Make or Break? A Background to the ATSIC Changes and the ATSIC Review', Parliament of Australia website, http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/Publications_Archive/CIB/cib0203/03cib29, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The new government was also responsible for a significant boost to AIAS funding.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition"&gt;Bryson, Ian (2002), Recording culture in transition, Bringing to Light: a history of ethnographic filmmaking at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra, pp 52–73&lt;/ref&gt;

The appointment of Peter Ucko in 1972 as Principal of the AIAS has since been described as the beginning of an increase in involvement of Aboriginal people in the workings of the Institute.&lt;ref name="Peter Ucko Obituary"&gt;Shennan, Stephen, ‘Peter Ucko Obituary’, The Guardian, 9 July 2007, https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jul/09/guardianobituaries.obituaries, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In his time as Principal, Ucko was responsible for implementing a policy later labelled “Aboriginalisation”, which was aimed at opening up the Institute to Aboriginal involvement and representation.&lt;ref name="Moser,1995"&gt;Moser, Stephanie, ‘The Aboriginalisation of Archaeology’, in Ucko, Peter J (ed) Theory in Archaeology: A World Perspective, Routledge, London, 1995, p152&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was influenced by a document circulated in 1974, called the Eaglehawk and Crow letter, which criticised the current model of academic research.&lt;ref&gt;Mulvaney, John (2011), Digging Up the Past, University of NSW Press, Sydney, p186&lt;/ref&gt; The letter asserted that anthropologists "should not pretend that their studies are objective when the overwhelming factor in the lives of Aborigines is our oppression by the society of which the anthropologist is, to a greater or lesser extent, a part of." Its authors called for increased participation of Aboriginal people in the running of the Institute and for greater control over commissioning and funding of research into their cultures.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Widder, T et al, ''Open Letter concerning the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, ''referred to as the "Eaglehawk and Crow letter", 29 March 1974, http://www.50yearjourney.aiatsis.gov.au/stage4/_media/eaglehawk_and_crow_letter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy and structural changes to the Institute continued throughout the 1970s.

The Aboriginal Advisory Committee was established in 1975, and consisted of the six Aboriginal members of the AIAS Council.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p164&lt;/ref&gt; Early recommendations including increased representation of Aboriginal people on committees and the AIAS Council as well as employment at the Institute.&lt;ref name="Moser,1995" /&gt; The committee was renamed in 1978, to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Advisory Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p185&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975–1976, a category of research grants for Aboriginal researchers was introduced.&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt; The emergence of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people filling the role of ‘cultural practitioner’, travelling to the AIAS to provide advice on projects and research being undertaken, was also documented from around 1976 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p175&lt;/ref&gt;

The time Peter Ucko spent as Principal of the AIAS saw a phase of “rapid expansion”&lt;ref name="Peter Ucko Obituary" /&gt; for the Institute.

The AIAS Film Unit that had operated in Sydney until 1973 was re-established in Canberra in 1975. Prominent American-born [[ethnographic film]]maker David MacDougall was appointed as the Director of this new AIAS Film Unit. With his wife and filmmaking partner Judith, and Kim McKenzie, the Film Unit operated until 1988 when its functions were absorbed back into the Institute.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt;

During the MacDougall/McKenzie era, a new style of ethnographic film was explored.&lt;ref name="Ethno film,ASO"&gt;'Australian Ethnographic Film', Australian Screen Online website, http://aso.gov.au/titles/collections/ethnographic-film-in-Australia/, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; One that moved away from film as a scientific record in favour of telling the story of individuals lives.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt; The filmmakers also practised a more collaborative approach to their films, and chose to use translations and subtitles to give direct access to the subjects voice and thoughts rather than the dominant ‘voice of god’ narration style.&lt;ref name="Ethno film,ASO" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacDougall, David, 'Subtitling Ethnographic Films: Archetypes into Individualities', Visual Anthropology Review, 11 (1): 83–91&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most notable films produced towards the end of this period was ''Waiting for Harry'', a prize-winning film&lt;ref&gt;‘'Waiting for Harry’', Royal Anthropological Institute website, https://www.therai.org.uk/film/volume-ii-contents/waiting-for-harry {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129024103/https://www.therai.org.uk/film/volume-ii-contents/waiting-for-harry |date=29 November 2014 }}, retrieved 11 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; directed by Kim McKenzie with [[anthropologist]] [[Les Hiatt]] and now considered to exemplify the "style of collaborative filmmaking" the Film Unit favoured in their work.&lt;ref name="Ethno film,ASO" /&gt;

The power of film to "influence opinion"&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt; was becoming increasingly recognised and with this, the lack of representation of Aboriginal people telling their own stories. In 1978, a meeting chaired by prominent activist and academic [[Marcia Langton]] expressed these concerns, arguing for greater access to film and video in Aboriginal communities, and training in film production by the AIAS.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt;

By the following year, the AIAS Film Unit had begun to implement a training program&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt; and had started employing trainee Aboriginal filmmakers on productions by the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;'A Short History of Indigenous Filmmaking', Australian Screen Online website, http://aso.gov.au/titles/collections/indigenous-filmmaking/, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The AIAS began presenting a biennial Wentworth Lecture in 1978, named as a tribute to [[William Wentworth (Australian politician)|W.C. Wentworth]] for his role in establishing the Institute.&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt; The lecture is presented by prominent person with knowledge or experience relating to issues affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia today.&lt;ref name="Wentworth Lecture"/&gt;

The expansion of the Institute continued into the 1980s. The Aboriginal Studies Press began publishing the Australian Aboriginal Studies Journal in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;Australian aboriginal studies: journal of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, Deaking University Library, http://encore.deakin.edu.au/iii/encore/record/C__Rb2865270, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; a peer-reviewed journal aimed at  “promoting high-quality research in Australian Indigenous studies.”&lt;ref name="ASJ"&gt;‘Australian Aboriginal Studies online’, Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/publications/australian-aboriginal-studies-journal, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the AIAS established a task force that identified the prevailing need for further ‘Aboriginalisation’ of the Institute’s workforce. At the time, there were four Aboriginal staff members, making up around 7% of the total staff.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p280&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1985 with the creation of the role of Aboriginal Studies Coordination Officer within the AIAS, whose responsibilities involved improving access for Aboriginal people to the research and resources of the Institute.&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt;

The ‘After 200 Years’ project was launched in 1985, aiming to fill some of the gaps in the AIAS photographic collection; particularly images of daily life in the southern, urban parts of Australia. Aboriginal involvement in selecting subject matter, photographing and documenting the collection was a major part of the project. The three-year project culminated in the publication of a book containing hundreds of photographs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and selected by them to represent their community.&lt;ref name="After 200 Years"&gt;Taylor, Penny.

The Rock Art Protection Program (RAPP) commenced in 1986 following a request for such an initiative by the then Minister of Aboriginal Affairs [[Clyde Holding]]. The aim of the RAPP was to protect Australian Indigenous rock art. Grants were approved by the Institute to fund various projects related to rock art protection.&lt;ref&gt;Ward. Graeme K, 'The role of AIATSIS in research and protection of Australian rock art', in: ''Rock Art Research''. Vol 28, no. 1 (May 2011), p 7-16&lt;/ref&gt;

The collections were also expanding, and by 1987 the AIATSIS library encompassed the print collections, a special Bibliographic Section and the Resource Centre (which contained the Institute’s audiovisual materials).&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt;

Between 1987 and 1989, the survival of the AIAS as an independent statutory body was tied to a proposal for a new statutory commission that would take over all aspects of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, pp288-308&lt;/ref&gt; This commission would become the [[Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission]] (ATSIC), conceived in an Act of Parliament in 1989.&lt;ref name="aph.gov.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Kingsley, 'ATSIC: Origins and Issues for the Future’, A Critical Review of Public Domain Research and Other Materials, AIATSIS Research Discussion Paper # 12, 2004, p5, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/products/discussion_paper/palmerk-dp12-atsic-origins-issues-future-research.pdf, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The AIAS would not be folded into this commission; instead it would be recreated under a new Act with a new name.&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt;

===AIATSIS (1989–now)===
The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) Act was passed by parliament in 1989, replacing the AIAS Act.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Act 1989, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aioaatsisa1989702/, retrieved 20 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The newly established AIATSIS had a reduced Council consisting of nine members,&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt; with the AIATSIS Act specifying that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people hold a minimum of five of these Council positions.&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Act 1989, Section 12, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aioaatsisa1989702/s12.html, retrieved 17 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the Institute launched a two-year Library Digitisation Pilot Program (LDPP). Among the items digitised, catalogued and made available online were 267 volumes of the Dawn and New Dawn magazines held in the AIATSIS collection.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Lewincamp &amp; Julie Faulkner, ‘A keyhole to the collection’, 11th Information Online Conference (2003) website, http://conferences.alia.org.au/online2003/papers/lewincamp.html#_ftn1, retrieved 20 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Dawn and New Dawn Magazines’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/collections-online/digitised-collections/dawn-and-new-dawn, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; AIATSIS also distributed over 2000 free copies of these magazines on CD-Rom, to Indigenous organisations, schools and libraries in New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Annual Report 2004-2005, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/products/corporate/ar200405-04-chapter3-collections.pdf, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies (GERAIS).JPG|thumb|right|The Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies (GERAIS)]]
[[File:Chrissy Grant, Chair of the AIATSIS Research Ethics Committee, running a GERAIS workshop at AIATSIS, 2015.JPG|thumb|right|Chrissy Grant, Chair of the AIATSIS Research Ethics Committee, running a GERAIS workshop at AIATSIS, 2015]]
AIATSIS publishes the Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies (referred to as GERAIS),&lt;ref&gt;''Guidelines for Ethical Research in Indigenous Studies'', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Canberra, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; a document considered to be the leading ethics guidelines for conducting research in and with Indigenous communities in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Janke, Terri, ''Writing up Indigenous research: authorship, copyright and Indigenous knowledge systems'',Terri Janke and Co, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The guidelines consist of 14 principles. These principles broadly fit under the following themes:

*rights, respect and recognition
*negotiation, consultation, agreement and mutual understanding
*participation, collaboration and partnership
*benefits, outcomes and giving back
*managing research: use, storage and access, and
*reporting and compliance&lt;ref name="EthicsMedia"&gt;‘Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/ethical-research/guidelines-ethical-research-australian-indigenous-studies, retrieved 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The GERAIS document is required reading for researchers applying for Ethical Clearance for research sponsored by AIATSIS.&lt;ref name="EthicsApplication"&gt;‘Application process’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/ethical-research/application-process, retrieved 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janke, Terri, Writing up Indigenous research:  authorship, copyright and Indigenous knowledge system, Terri Janke and Co, 2009, p15&lt;/ref&gt; However, the guidelines are also intended by AIATSIS to inform all research in the field of Indigenous studies.&lt;ref name=GERAIS /&gt;

Originally published by AIATSIS in 2000, the latest version of the GERAIS document was published in 2012. This update was made to reflect legal and technological developments that had occurred since original publication. In particular, in the area of intellectual property and the rights of Indigenous people in their traditional knowledge and cultural expressions as well as progress in digitisation technologies and data and information management.&lt;ref name=GERAIS /&gt;&lt;ref name=EthicsMedia /&gt;

These changes reflect AIATSIS’ support for the importance of research projects involving appropriate ethical conduct and rights protection for both the way data is collected during research and the findings and materials generated through that research.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Michael. ''Bringing ethics up to date: a review of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies ethical guidelines''. In: Australian Aboriginal Studies. no. 2,2010, p. 10-21&lt;/ref&gt;

The GERAIS document is the first point of reference in the ethical review process researchers must undergo before AIATSIS will sponsor a research project. All research projects are reviewed by the Research Ethics Committee for approval, using the following project documents:

*an ethical clearance proposal, using the GERAIS document as a guide,
*a plain English statement to explain to participants what the project is and how it will be conducted, and
*informed consent forms, that are completed by participants of the research.&lt;ref name=EthicsApplication /&gt;

In 2013, AIATSIS was involved in the review of two [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] research ethics guidelines relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health research.&lt;ref&gt;'Evaluation of NHMRC Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Research Ethics', The Lowitja Institute website, http://www.lowitja.org.au/nhmrc-research-ethics, 20 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==

===Overview===
AIATSIS is the only Commonwealth institution responsible for collecting and maintaining materials documenting the oral and visual traditions and histories of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.&lt;ref name=CDP /&gt; The Institute identifies its collection as a “keeping place for culturally significant objects” that is “a resource for anybody looking to improve their knowledge of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history and culture.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;‘AIATSIS Collections’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute's holdings represent thousands of years of history and more than 500 Australian Indigenous languages, dialects and groups. This collection supports, and is a result of, research in the fields of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies.&lt;ref name=CDP /&gt;

An independent assessment in 2014 confirmed that AIATSIS holds over 6 million feet of film,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; over 40,000 hours of audio, 12,800 unpublished manuscripts and record series, 653,000 photographs, and 120,000 print and published materials (3,000 of which are rare books) among other miscellanea.&lt;ref&gt;’50 years of culture and collections’, 15 December 2014, http://www.indigenous.gov.au/news-and-media/stories/50-years-culture-and-collections&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of items within the AIATSIS collection that have been both nationally and internationally recognised as significant:

The Audiovisual Archives also holds copies of the first audio recorded in Australia;&lt;ref&gt;‘Musical Connections: The Life and Work of Alice Moyle, AIATSIS Online Exhibition, http://aiatsis.gov.au/archive_digitised_collections/alice/home.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320123750/http://aiatsis.gov.au/archive_digitised_collections/alice/home.html |date=20 March 2015 }}, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; a series of ethnographic wax cylinder recordings made in the Torres Strait Islands in 1898.  The Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to the Torres Strait, led by [[Alfred Cort Haddon]], recorded songs and speech from Mer/Murray Island, Mabuiag/Jervis Island, Saibai Island, Tudu Island and Iama/Yam Island.

The AIATSIS collection is housed and managed through the Library and the Audiovisual Archive,&lt;ref name="Barbara Lewincamp 2003"&gt;Barbara Lewincamp &amp; Julie Faulkner (2003) 'A keyhole to the collection: the AIATSIS Library Digitisation Pilot Program’, ‘’The Australian Library Journal’’, 52:3, 239–245, DOI: 10.1080/00049670.2003.10721551&lt;/ref&gt; and is broadly categorised into the following groups:

'''Art and artefact:''' a collection of items including ritual objects, folk art, children’s art and modern or ‘high art’ and span from the late 19th century to the present day. This sub-collection comprises around 600 artworks and 500 artefacts, acquired either as a result of AIATSIS-sponsored field research or through donation or purchase.&lt;ref&gt;‘Art and artefacts’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/art-and-artefacts, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Books and printed material:''' a collection of books, pamphlets, serials including magazines and government reports, reference publications such as dictionaries and other published material.

[[File:Colour slides from the Wright collection containing images of Upper Yule River Rock Art.jpg|thumb|left|Colour slides from the Wright collection (WRIGHT.B02.CS) containing images of Upper Yule River Rock Art]]
'''Manuscripts and rare books:''' a collection of more than 11,700 manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;‘AIATSIS Collections Highlights’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 2,600 rare books dating from 1766,&lt;ref&gt;Callander, John, ‘’Terra australis cognita, or, Voyages to the Terra australis’’, Printed for the author and sold by Messrs Hawes, Clark, and Collins, in Pater-noster-Row, London, 1766–1768, call number RB C156.25/T1, AIATSIS library catalogue&lt;/ref&gt; 2,200 rare pamphlets and 1,700 rare serial titles consisting of 14,650 issues held in secure, environmentally controlled storage. Items are included in this classification on the basis of their age, rarity, value or sensitivity of the content for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Among these items are the Sorry Books and the [[William Edward Hanley Stanner|WEH Stanner]] papers.&lt;ref&gt;'Manuscripts and rare books', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/manuscripts-and-rare-books, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pictorial:''' this collection contains roughly 650,000 photographs that date from modern day as far back as the late 1800s, and more than 90% of images in the pictorial collection are unique to AIATSIS, making it the most comprehensive record of its kind relating to Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.&lt;ref&gt;‘Pictorial’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/pictorial, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sound:''' a collection of many unique and unpublished sound recordings totalling approximately 40,000 hours of audio. The recordings represent a breadth of cultural and historical information including languages, ceremonies, music, oral histories and interviews with participants in significant events such as the 1965 Freedom Rides and Prime Minister Kevin Rudd’s Apology to the Stolen Generations.&lt;ref&gt;‘Sound’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/sound, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisitions===
Since the establishment of the Institute in 1964, the AIATSIS collection has been developed through acquisition by donation, gift and purchase or, through materials created and collected during the work of ethnographic field researchers and filmmakers funded by the AIATSIS grants program. The collection has also been built through deposits of materials, an arrangement which permits the original owners to assign access and use conditions appropriate to the cultural information contained in the items.

AIATSIS’ approach to collection building is based on three primary criteria:

:1.	Comprehensiveness – the aim is to have the collection be as comprehensive as possible. Given limited resources, the Audiovisual Archive focuses primarily on unpublished audio and visual materials and the Library generally on published materials. Other items are collected where possible. 
:2.	Significance – items that meet this criteria are considered to make ‘a lasting contribution to worldwide knowledge’, reflect current AIATSIS research areas, valued by a particular Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community, are not well represented in other collections, have a link to AIATSIS’ own history. 
:3.	Representativeness – when resources are limited, AIATSIS will focus on collecting items that are ‘representative of a particular class of creativity, research discipline or mode of cultural production.’&lt;ref name=CDP /&gt;

===Collection management===
Once material has been acquired by AIATSIS, the Institute faces the challenges of maintaining a cultural resource collection.&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Act 1989, Section 5 (e)&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved through a collection management plan that involves processes of recording and cataloguing, and appropriate storage and handling to extend the life of physical items and preserving their content through format shifting.

Preservation of physical items in the collection is achieved in two key ways:

:1.	Assessment and monitoring for contaminants, such as insects and mould, as well as any potential deterioration through environmental factors or physical damage.&lt;ref name=CMP&gt;‘’AIATSIS Collection Management Plan 2013–2016’’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/about-us/collection-management-plan.pdf, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
:2.	Storage of collection items in climate-controlled vaults, to maintain their integrity and to minimise contact with deteriorating agents such as moisture and light. The Institute also follows international archiving guidelines for the storage and preservation of materials.&lt;ref&gt;‘Preservation, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/caring-collection/preservation, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
There are a wide variety of analogue photograph, tape and film formats held in the AIATSIS collection, which pose special preservation and future access risks. The age of some of these formats and materials, combined with the varying conditions in which they were stored prior to their acquisition by AIATSIS, heightens the deterioration of the media. Another preservation issue inherent in these analogue materials is the machines that can play back that particular format, as in some cases the material and the playback device are no longer manufactured. To manage these risks and maintain future access to the collection, preservation of the actual content contained in collection items is also achieved through a program of digitisation.&lt;ref name="Caring collection"&gt;‘Caring for the collection’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/caring-collection, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:An AIATSIS pictorial technician prepares a tin type photograph for scanning.jpg|thumb|An AIATSIS pictorial technician prepares a tin type photograph for scanning]]Due to the potential issues of long-term archiving and storage of digital items, the opposite process is often employed to ensure access and preservation.&lt;ref&gt;'Future Watch: Strategies for Long-Term Preservation of Electronic Records’, Gordon E.J Hoke, CRM, http://content.arma.org/IMM/May-June2012/futurewatchstrategiesforlongtermpreservation.aspx, retrieved 25 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Electronic Records – Problem Solved?: the Victorian Electronic Records Strategy and the future of electronic record keeping in Victoria’, VALA website, http://www.vala.org.au/vala2000/2000pdf/Gib_Hea.PDF, retrieved 25 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of digital publications and manuscripts, the originals will often be printed and incorporated into the print collections as an additional preservation measure.

The AIATSIS collection holds material that is sensitive and/or secret/sacred to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.&lt;ref&gt;‘Using the collection’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with its founding Act,&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Act, Section 41, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aioaatsisa1989702/s41.html, retrieved 23 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and as part of their collection management plan, AIATSIS adheres to strict protocols when handling and processing these sensitive items. The Institute also supports and adheres to the protocols developed by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Library, Information and Resource Network (ATSILIRN).&lt;ref name="ATSILIRN" /&gt; Restricted visual media such as photographs and printed items are stored separately to the rest of the collection and audio and moving image items are not played until any cultural requirements are checked. Restricted material must also be carefully handled during digitisation, which means that the work is carried out in secured conditions such as enclosed booths and by staff that can meet the protocols of the item being digitised.&lt;ref name="CAUP"&gt;‘AIATSIS Collection Access and Use Policy’, p 8, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/about-us/collections-access-use-policy.pdf, retrieved 12 March  2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digitisation program===
AIATSIS launched its Library Digitisation Pilot Program in 2001, before which the Library had no dedicated digitisation equipment or policies for managing digital materials. This two-year program was originally funded by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), and involved the creation of digital collections across the institution.&lt;ref name="Barbara Lewincamp 2003"/&gt;

Since then AIATSIS has continued to incorporate digitisation of the collection into its management plan,&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt; but have publicly stated that an increase in funding is required for the Institute to digitise some of the at risk formats held in the collection before those items are lost.&lt;ref&gt;Barnsley, Warren, 'AIATSIS digitisation funding welcome but still "inadequate"', '’National Indigenous Radio Service'’, 16 May 2014, http://nirs.org.au/blog/NEWS/article/33902/AIATSIS-digitisation-funding-welcome-but-still-inadequate.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raggatt, Matthew, ‘Historic indigenous collection in "severe and catastrophic state"’, ‘’The Canberra Times’’, 6 December 2014, http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/historic-indigenous-collection-in-severe-and-catastrophic-state-20141206-121hl1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Given these limitations, AIATSIS prioritises the selection of materials for digitisation using factors including significance of the item/s, the level of deterioration, cultural protocols, copyright status, and client demand.&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caring collection" /&gt; One of the identified priorities of the program is to digitise and preserve all of the audiovisual collection currently on endangered magnetic tape formats by the 2025 deadline set by UNESCO.&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt;

===Access to the collection===
[[File:Library stacks at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Canberra ACT Australia.tif|thumb|left|Library stacks showing some of the print collection available at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, in Canberra, ACT, Australia]]
The collection is housed in the AIATSIS building on Acton Peninsula and is accessible through a number of resources. The AIATSIS Library is open to the public and holds a range of printed materials including manuscripts, journals, readers in different Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages, dictionaries, published books and rare books, maps, and posters.

Access to AIATSIS' print and manuscript collections can be made through the Library's Stanner Reading Room and the film, sound and pictorial collections by appointment through the Access Unit. These physical access points are open limited hours.&lt;ref&gt;'Visiting the collection', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection/visiting-collection, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The AIATSIS Digitisation Program contributes to increased access to the collection; whether access is through on site resources, the provision of copies of materials or the sharing of the collection online. Due to increasing obsolescence of analogue formats, AIATSIS identifies digitisation as the way to preserve those items for future generations  to access.&lt;ref name=CDP /&gt; This is considered to be particularly important for facilitating “remote access by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities” as well as for access by researchers and the general public.&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt;

The AIATSIS Access Unit runs a program called Return of Material to Indigenous Communities (ROMTIC), through which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients are provided with up to twenty copies of collection materials that relate to their language group or family. This service is limited to items that have been preserved, so AIATSIS’ digitisation program has allowed an increasing number of digital items available to ROMTIC clients.&lt;ref&gt;‘Return of materials to Indigenous communities’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection/return-material-indigenous-communities, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

AIATSIS also makes the collection available through a series of online exhibitions and digitised collection material published on their website.&lt;ref&gt;‘Collections online’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/collections-onlinel{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; These showcase different themes or discrete collections of material, including:

Access to the AIATSIS collection is also dictated by legislation governing the Institute and in some instances by legal agreements outlining the terms under which collection materials can be used.

The terms for access to the AIATSIS collection are in the first instance set by the AIATSIS Act, Section 41. This section states:

:1.	"Where information or other matter has been deposited with the Institute under conditions of restricted access, the Institute or the Council shall not disclose that information or other matter except in accordance with those conditions.
:2.	The Institute or the Council shall not disclose information or other matter held by it (including information or other matter covered by subsection (1)) if that disclosure would be inconsistent with the views or sensitivities of relevant Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders."&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Act 1989, Section 41, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aioaatsisa1989702/s41.html, retrieved 12 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The conditions referred to in Section 41(1) of the AIATSIS Act are usually covered in the agreement that AIATSIS enters into when material is deposited. These agreements, along with the section 41(2) of the Act, can govern the way that unpublished material can be accessed and used.&lt;ref name=CAUP /&gt;

Access to and use of material in the AIATSIS collection is also subject to the terms set out in the [[Australian Copyright Act 1968|Copyright Act (1968)]].&lt;ref&gt;'Ordering collection items', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection/ordering-collection-items, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

When a donation or deposit is being made, AIATSIS requests to be made aware of any sensitive items included in the material.&lt;ref&gt;‘Donate to the collection’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/donate-collection, retrieved 12  March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The secret or sacred nature of information contained in many collection items is an important factor in access to the AIATSIS collection. To protect items of high cultural sensitivity and reflect appropriate cultural values, access to items that contain culturally sensitive information are restricted to groups or individuals who have the permission of the relevant Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community and the depositor if restrictions have been applied by them.&lt;ref&gt;‘AIATSIS Collection Access and Use Policy’, p 7, 9, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/about-us/collections-access-use-policy.pdf, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

AIATSIS also acknowledges the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] and in particular Article 31's recognition of the right of Indigenous people to "maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions."&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, United Nations, 2000, http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf, retrieved 12 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these complex issues AIATSIS developed an overarching Access and Use Policy in 2014, to “manage legal and cultural rights over material while maximising accessibility.”&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Annual Report 2013-2014, p42, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/publications/products/aiatsis-annual-report-2013-2014, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collection resources===
Since its inception, AIATSIS has developed and maintained a range of resources to enhance discoverability of the collection.

One of the most significant of these resources is the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Biographical Index (ABI). The ABI had its beginnings in 1979 as a non-selective biographical register of names, constructed using information on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from published material in the collection. In the early years of the biographical register, it was hoped it could “provide an important record of the achievements of Aboriginal people, and be a source of pride for generations to come".&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, Laurie and Barwick, Diane. Beginning a national Aboriginal biographical register at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies. Aboriginal history. Vol. 6 pt. 2, 1982. p. 135-138&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the index continues to be updated, now containing over 70,000 records and searchable online through AIATSIS’ collection catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;‘The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Biographical Index’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/guides-and-resources/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-biographical-index, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Other resources available on site include the Perfect Pictures Database, which contains over 140,000 digitised images from the AIATSIS Photographic Collection. This database is added to as more images are digitised and only includes images that are free of secret/sacred access restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;‘Pictures database’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/pictorial/pictures-database, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location of the Institute==
[[File:Institute of Aboriginal Studies, Canberra 2007.JPG|thumb|The west wing of the AIATSIS building designed by [[Ashton Raggatt McDougall]], is a black replica of [[Le Corbusier]]'s iconic [[Villa Savoye]]]]

AIATSIS is located on the [[Acton Peninsula]]&lt;ref&gt;'Contact us', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/get-involved/contact-us, retrieved 18 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; in a building that was newly built for the Institute and opened in 2001. The building was officially opened by the Honourable [[William Wentworth (Australian politician)|W.C. Wentworth]] and [[Ken Colbung|Mr Ken Colbung]]. As part of the opening the [[Ngunnawal people]], the traditional owners of the land on which the AIATSIS building stands performed a [[Welcome to Country and Acknowledgement of Country|Welcome to Country]] and [[smoking ceremony]], and the Anbarra people from North Central Arnhem Land performed a friendship ceremony, known as Rom.&lt;ref name="Koori Mail building"&gt;'AIATSIS finds a home', The Koori Mail, Issue 261, Wednesday 3 October 2001, p10, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/collections-online/digitised-collections/koori-mail/koori-mail-issues&lt;/ref&gt;

The architect, [[Howard Raggatt|Howard Ragatt]] of the firm Ashton Raggatt McDougall designed the building for AIATSIS and for its neighbour on the Acton Peninsula, the [[National Museum of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;The National Museum of Australia as Danse Macabre' in Healy, C &amp; Witcomb, A (eds), South Pacific Museums: Experiments in Culture, Monash University ePress, Victoria, 2006, p191&lt;/ref&gt; The building cost $13.75 million and was funded by the Commonwealth Government’s Centenary of Federation Grants Program.&lt;ref name="Koori Mail building"/&gt;

The design of the AIATSIS building has been the subject of differing interpretations. The rear of the building has been described as a black copy of pioneer architect [[Le Corbusier]]'s 1920's [[Villa Savoye]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;'The National Museum of Australia as Danse Macabre' in Healy, C &amp; Witcomb, A (eds), South Pacific Museums: Experiments in Culture, Monash University ePress, Victoria, 2006, p198&lt;/ref&gt; The architect, Howard Raggatt, was quoted as confirming this influence&lt;ref&gt;“Letters and Fixes: NMA, AIATSIS and Consultation”, Architecture Australia website, http://architectureau.com/articles/letters-and-fixes-6/, retrieved 5 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; but has also stated that it is designed to be reminiscent of [[Sidney Nolan]]'s famous paintings of Ned Kelly.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Dimitry (ed), National Museum of Australia: Tangled Destinies, Images Publishing, Victoria, 2002, p66&lt;/ref&gt;

During design of the AIATSIS building, it was reoriented from original plans to save two [[Eucalyptus bridgesiana|Apple Box trees]] that were identified as significant to the Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Report relating to the proposed new facilities for the National Museum of Australia and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, Parliament of Australia, 1998, p64&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early years===
Griffiths was born in [[Walton-on-Thames]], Surrey, England, at the end of 1906, the youngest of three children of a middle-class family. Shortly after Griffiths' birth, his father was betrayed by a business partner and was left penniless. His mother took the children and established residence in a smaller home which she maintained, though she had to find work to support herself and the children. At age 12, Griffiths was sent to [[Christ's Hospital]], a school for poor boys.&lt;ref name="Bede"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fastiggi|first1=Robert|last2=Pereira|first2=Jose|title=The Sawmi from Oxford|url=http://www.bedegriffiths.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/The-Swami-from-Oxford.pdf|accessdate=20 October 2017|work=Crisis|issue=March 1991|date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students of this school were nicknamed "bluecoats". He excelled in his studies and earned a scholarship to the [[University of Oxford]] where, in 1925, he began his studies in English literature and philosophy at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]]. In his third year at university he came under the tutelage of [[C. S. Lewis]], who became a lifelong friend. Griffiths graduated from Oxford in 1929 with a degree in journalism.

Shortly after graduation Griffiths, with fellow Oxford alumni [[Martyn Skinner]] and Hugh Waterman, settled in a cottage in the [[Cotswold]]s and began what they called an "experiment in common living".&lt;ref&gt;The golden string. 1954&lt;/ref&gt; They followed a lifestyle attuned to nature, milking cows and selling the milk to support themselves. They would read the Bible together as a form of literature. Griffiths noted a strong connection between the teachings of [[Scripture]] and the rhythm of the nature around them. The experiment lasted less than a year, as one of the friends found the life too demanding. Nevertheless, the experience had a strong effect on Griffiths.

As a result of this experience, Griffiths decided to seek [[Holy Orders]] in the [[Church of England]]. He was advised, however, to gain some experience in the slums of London. This advice was so contrary to what Griffiths felt to be his [[vocation]] that it drove him to a crisis of faith, which nearly drove him to an emotional breakdown.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Guided by the writings of [[Cardinal Newman]], he reached a point in this struggle where he had a spiritual breakthrough. He recounts the story of his conversion in his autobiography ''The Golden String''.

In November 1931, Griffiths went to stay at the [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] [[monastery]] of [[Prinknash Abbey]] where he was impressed by the life. Despite the strong anti-Roman Catholic sentiments of his mother, he was received into the Roman Catholic Church and made his [[First Communion]] at Christmas Eve [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]] at the abbey.

===Benedictine monastic life===
Griffiths was received by the abbey as a [[postulant]] a month after his reception into the Catholic Church. On 29 December 1932, he entered the [[novitiate]] and was given the monastic name of "Bede". He made his solemn [[profession]] in 1937 (a year before the death of his mother in a car accident) and was [[ordained]] to the [[Catholic priesthood]] in 1940.

In 1947 the abbey sent a group of 25 monks to give support to two monasteries in the United Kingdom which had been founded by monks from France. Griffiths was chosen to be the [[prior|obedientiary prior]] for the monastery at [[St Michael's Abbey, Farnborough|Farnborough]] in Hampshire. He led that house for four years, but was unable to generate sufficient financial support to keep the community going. The abbot then sent him to the other monastery, [[Pluscarden Abbey]] in Scotland. It was there that he wrote his autobiography.

During Griffiths' time at Farnborough, he had come to know Father Benedict Alapatt, a European-born monk of Indian descent who was greatly interested in establishing a monastery in his homeland. Griffiths had already been introduced to Eastern thought, [[yoga]] and the [[Vedas]] and took interest in this proposed project. The abbot at first refused permission, but later changed his mind and authorised Griffiths to go to India with the Indian member of the community. There was one condition, though: Griffiths was not to be there as a member of the abbey, but as a priest subject to a local bishop, which meant that he would be giving up his vows.

===Christian yogi===
After some painful inner debate, Griffiths agreed to this and, in 1955, he embarked for India with Alapatt. At the time, he wrote to a friend: "I am going to discover the other half of my soul."{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} After arriving and visiting some spiritual centres in the country, they settled in [[Kengeri]] in [[Bangalore, India|Bangalore]], considered{{by whom|date=November 2011}} the garden spot of India, with the goal of building a monastery there. That project was eventually unsuccessful as Griffiths left the location in 1958, saying that he found it "too Western".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Man, monk, mystic|first=Sister Pascaline, OSB|last=Coff|work=The Bede Griffiths Trust|url=http://www.bedegriffiths.com/bede-griffiths/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffiths then joined with a [[Belgian people|Belgian]] monk, Father [[Francis Acharya]], [[Trappists|OCSO]], to establish [[Kristiya Sanyasa Samaj,Kurisumala Ashram|Kristiya Sanyasa Samaj, Kurisumala Ashram]] ("Mountain of the Cross"), a [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Rite]] monastery of the [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]] in Kerala. They sought to develop a form of monastic life based in the Indian tradition, adopting the [[saffron]] garments of an Indian ''[[sannyasi]]'' (an [[ascetic]] or monk). At that point, Griffiths took the [[Sanskrit]] name "'''Dayananda'''" ("bliss of compassion"). During that time he continued his studies in the religions and cultures of India, writing ''Christ in India'' while there. He also visited the United States during the period, giving a number of talks about East–West dialogue and being interviewed by [[CBS]] television.

Later, in 1968, Griffiths moved to the [[Saccidananda Ashram]] (also known as ''Shantivanam''; [[Tamil language|Tamil]] for "forest of peace") in [[Tamil Nadu]], South India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bedegriffiths.com/ashrams/ |work=The Bede Griffiths Trust |title=Saccidananda Ashram |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613061415/http://www.bedegriffiths.com/ashrams/ |archivedate=13 June 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been founded in 1950 by the French Benedictine monk [[Abhishiktananda]] (Dom Henri Le&amp;nbsp;Saux, OSB), from the [[Abbey of Kergonan]], along with another Frenchman, the [[Abbé]] Jules Monchanin. The two had developed a religious lifestyle which was completely expressed in authentic Indian fashion, using English, Sanskrit and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] in their religious services. They had built the ashram buildings by hand in the style of the poor of the country. Monchanin had died in 1957 and Le&amp;nbsp;Saux wanted to devote himself to a [[hermit]]'s life. Griffiths came with two other monks to assume life there and to allow Le&amp;nbsp;Saux his wish.

Griffiths resumed his studies of Indian thought, trying to relate it to Christian theology. At this point, he became known as "'''Swami Dayananda'''" ("bliss of compassion"). He wrote 12 books on [[Hindu]]–Christian dialogue. During this period, Griffiths desired to reconnect himself with the Benedictine order and sought a monastic [[congregation (Catholic)|congregation]] which would accept him in the way of life he had developed over the decades. He was welcomed by the [[Camaldolese]] monks, and he and the ashram became a part of their congregation.

===Final years===
In January 1990, Griffiths suffered a stroke in his room at the ashram. A month later, to the day, he was declared healed. The following year, he began a period of extensive travel, making annual visits to the United States, then later to Europe, where he met the [[Dalai Lama]]. He noted to a friend, "I do believe that he liked me."&lt;ref&gt;"Bede Griffiths:Meeting the Dalai Lama" by  Meath Conlin on his website, Diverse Journeys, 22 June 2010 [http://diversejourneys.com/?p=1214]&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his journey, giving lectures in Germany and England. He arrived back at the ashram in October 1992, where an Australian film crew were awaiting him to make a documentary about his life, which was released as ''A Human Search''.

Three days after the completion of filming, on his 86th birthday, Griffiths had a major stroke. The following month, he had a further series of strokes. He died at Shantivanam on 13 May 1993, aged 86.

'''Biostimulation''' involves the modification of the environment to stimulate existing [[bacteria]] capable of [[bioremediation]].  This can be done by addition of various forms of rate limiting [[nutrient]]s and [[electron acceptors]], such as [[phosphorus]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], or [[carbon]] (e.g. in the form of [[molasses]]).  Alternatively, remediation of [[halogenated]] contaminants in [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] environments may be stimulated by adding [[electron donors]] (organic substrates), thus allowing indigenous [[microorganisms]] to use the halogenated contaminants as [[electron acceptors]].[https://clu-in.org/techfocus/default.focus/sec/Bioremediation/cat/Anaerobic_Bioremediation_(Direct)/ EPA Anaerobic Bioremediation Technologies] Additives are usually added to the subsurface through injection wells, although injection well technology for biostimulation purposes is still emerging.  Removal of the contaminated material is also an option, albeit an expensive one.  Biostimulation can be enhanced by [[bioaugmentation]].  This process, overall, is referred to as [[bioremediation]] and is an [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]-approved method for reversing the presence of oil or gas spills.  While biostimulation is usually associated with remediation of [[hydrocarbon]] or [[high production volume chemical]] spills, it is also potentially useful for treatment of less frequently encountered contaminant spills, such as [[pesticides]], particularly [[herbicides]].&lt;ref&gt;Kanissery, R.G., and G.K. Sims.  2011.  Biostimulation for the enhanced degradation of herbicides in soil. Applied and Environmental Soil Science. Volume 2011 (2011), Article ID 843450, doi:10.1155/2011/843450. http://www.hindawi.com/journals/aess/2011/843450/&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary advantage of biostimulation is that bioremediation will be undertaken by already present native [[microorganisms]] that are well-suited to the subsurface environment, and are well distributed spatially within the subsurface.  The primary disadvantage is that the delivery of additives in a manner that allows the additives to be readily available to subsurface microorganisms is based on the local geology of the subsurface.  Tight, impermeable subsurface [[lithology]] (tight [[clay]]s or other fine-grained material) make it difficult to spread additives throughout the affected area.  Fractures in the subsurface create preferential pathways in the subsurface which additives preferentially follow, preventing even distribution of additives.

Recently a number of products have been introduced which allow popular use of bioremediation using biostimulative methods.  They may harness local bacteria using biostimulation by creating a hospitable environment for hydrocarbon-devouring microorganisms, or they may introduce foreign bacteria into the environment as a direct application to the hydrocarbon.  While the jury is out as to whether either is particularly more effective than the other, ''prima facie'' consideration suggests the introduction of foreign bacteria to any environment stands a chance of mutating organisms already present and affecting the biome.

Investigations to determine subsurface characteristics (such as natural [[groundwater]] velocity during ambient conditions, [[hydraulic conductivity]] of the subsurface, and lithology of the subsurface) are important in developing a successful biostimulation system.  In addition, a pilot-scale study of the potential biostimulation system should be undertaken prior to full-scale design and implementation.

However, some biostimulative agents may be used in chaotic surfaces such as open water and sand so long as they are [oleophilic], meaning that they [[Chemical bond|bond]] exclusively to hydrocarbons, and basically sink in the [[water column]], bonding to oil, where they then float to the water's surface, exposing the hydrocarbon to more abundant [[sunlight]] and [[oxygen]] where greater micro-organic [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] activity can be encouraged.  Some consumer-targeted biostimulants bond possess this quality, others do not.

The Council approves policies, strategy, budgets and major funding. On 11 February 2016, the Minister for Universities and Science, [[Jo Johnson]], announced the appointment of Professor Melanie Welham as interim Chief Executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prof Melanie Welham appointed BBSRC Chief Executive|url=http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/news/people-skills-training/2016/160211-pr-melanie-welham-interim-bbsrc-chief-executive/|publisher=GOV.UK|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Welham was previously Executive Director of Science at BBSRC.

A Research Panel provides expert advice which BBSRC Council draws upon in making decisions. The purpose of the Research Panel is to advise on:

* the development and implementation of the Council's strategic plans
* the competitiveness, relevance, economic impact, and societal considerations of the science and innovation activities funded by BBSRC
* opportunities for partnership with national and international organisations

===Boards, panels and committees===
In addition to the Council and the Research Panel, BBSRC has a series of other internal bodies for specific purposes.

* Appointments Board
* Audit Board
* Remuneration Board
* Strategy Panels - eight Panels advise and report to the BBSRC Chief Executive
* Research Committees - five Committees award research grants in specific science areas

==Institutes of BBSRC==

The Council strategically funds eight research institutes in the UK, and a number of centres ([http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/organisation/institutes BBSRC: Institutes and centres]).

The Institutes are tasked with delivering innovative, world class bioscience research and training, leading to wealth and job creation, generating high returns for the UK economy.{{cn|date=October 2015}} They have strong links with business, industry and the wider community, and support policy development.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

'''Bristol Byzantine''' is a variety of [[Byzantine Revival architecture]] that was popular in the city of [[Bristol]] from about 1850 to 1880.

Many buildings in the style have been destroyed or demolished, but notable surviving examples include the [[Colston Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Colston Hall  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379355 | accessdate=2007-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Granary, Bristol|Granary on Welsh Back]], the [[Carriage Works, Bristol |Carriage Works]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=No.104 The Carriage Works  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380632 | accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Stokes Croft]] and several of the buildings around Victoria Street. Several of the warehouses around the harbour have survived including the [[Arnolfini]] which now houses an art gallery.&lt;ref name="Bush House"&gt;{{cite web | title=Bush House | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380204 | accessdate=2006-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clarks Wood Company warehouse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Clarks Wood Company warehouse | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380529 | accessdate=2007-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[St Vincent's Works]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=St Vincent's Works and attached front area railings | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380525 | accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Silverthorne Lane and the [[Wool Hall, Bristol|Wool Hall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=No.12 The Wool Hall, including the Fleece and Firkin Public House| work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380514 | accessdate=2007-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in St Thomas Street are other survivors from the 19th century.

==Style==
Bristol Byzantine has influences from [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and [[Moorish architecture]] applied mainly to industrial buildings such as warehouses and factories.

The style is characterised by a robust and simple outline, materials with character and colour including red, yellow, black and white brick primarily from the [[Cattybrook Brickpit]].

Several buildings included archways and upper floors unified through either horizontal or vertical grouping of window openings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bristol Byzantine |work=Looking at Buildings |url=http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/default.asp?Document=3.C.1.6 |accessdate=2007-05-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234936/http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/default.asp?Document=3.C.1.6 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first building with some of the characteristics generally thought of a Bristol Byzantine is Bush House, which is now known as the [[Arnolfini]] a 19th-century Grade II* [[listed building|listed]]&lt;ref name="Bush House" /&gt; [[tea]] warehouse situated on the side of the [[Floating Harbour]] in [[Bristol city centre]]. The architect was [[Richard Shackleton Pope]], who constructed first the south part of the warehouse (1831) then extended it to the north in 1835–36. It has a rock-faced plinth, three storeys of rectangular windows recessed within tall round arches, and a shallow attic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bush House |work=Looking at Buildings |url=http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/cities/bristol/bush-house.html |accessdate=2010-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The style may have come about as a result of an acquaintance between [[William Venn Gough]] and Archibald Ponton, who designed [[Granary, Bristol|the Granary]] and [[John Addington Symonds]] the Bristol-born historian of the [[Italian renaissance]]. The term Bristol Byzantine is thought to have been invented by Sir [[John Summerson]].&lt;ref name="Brace"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brace |first=Keith |title=Portrait of Bristol |year=1996 |publisher=Robert Hale |location=London |isbn=0-7091-5435-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Civics''' or '''civic education''' is the study of the theoretical, political and practical aspects of [[citizenship]], as well as its rights and duties.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012 p. 6"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennedy |first=Kerry |title=Citizenship Education And The Modern State |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OoYsBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6 |access-date=1 December 2018 |location=Washington, D.C |year=1997 |isbn=978-1-136-36864-6 |oclc=820719540 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes the study of [[Civil law (area)|civil law]] and [[civil code]], and the study of government with attention to the role of citizens―as opposed to external factors―in the operation and oversight of government.&lt;ref name="BeachRines"&gt;Frederick Converse Beach, George Edwin Rines, [[Encyclopedia Americana|''The Americana: a universal reference library, comprising the arts and sciences, literature, history, biography, geography, commerce, etc., of the world'']], Volume 5, Scientific American compiling department, 1912, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

The ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' dictionary defines civics as "the study of the rights and duties of citizens and of how government works." The definition from dictionary.com is: "the study or science of the privileges and obligations of citizens."

== History ==

Within a given political or [[ethical tradition]], ''civics'' can refer to [[educating]] the [[citizens]]. The history of civics dates back to the earliest theories of civics by [[Confucius]] in ancient China and by [[Plato]] in [[ancient Greece]]. In China also along with Confucianism developed the tradition of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]]. These traditions in the [[Eastern world|East]] and in the [[Western world|West]] developed to an extent differently, therefore, with bringing in the past different concepts of citizens' rights and the application of [[justice]], together with different [[ethics]] in public life.{{clarify|date=May 2016}} This was mainly valid before the translation of the Western legal tradition to Chinese which started in 1839, after which influence by Western tradition was brought{{by whom|date=May 2016}} to China, with periods of restoration of [[traditional Chinese law]] and influence by [[Soviet law]]; specific is the common ordinary language used in Chinese laws which has a significant educational role.

The '''Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching''', also referred to as the '''Cognitive Theory of Interactive Teaching''', was developed by Allan Collins and Albert L. Stevens (Collins &amp; Stevens, 1981).  Allan Collins was a chief scientist at Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc., a research firm in Cambridge Massachusetts. He is also a specialist in the field of [[cognitive science]] and human semantic processing.  Albert L. Stevens was a senior scientist at Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. He was also director of the company's [[Artificial Intelligence]], [[Education Technology]] and Training Systems Division.  He is also a specialist in cognitive science. (Reigeluth, 1983)
The Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching according to Collins and Stevens (1981) requires the learner to construct theories and principles through dialogue, the teaching of self-questioning techniques and the teaching of [[metacognitive]] or [[self-monitoring]] skills, all with the intent of clarifying misconceptions so the theory or principle is well articulated and developed.  The essence of the cognitive theory of Inquiry teaching is that of developing students' metacognitive skills. Inquiry teaching deliberately attempts to develop these stills through instruction.

The theory is a prescriptive model rooted in the discovery tradition and cognitive sciences. It was derived form an analysis of the transcripts of teachers, described as interactive teachers, using a variety of teaching strategies. These strategies were in some way related to one of the following methodology: the inquiry method of the teaching, discovery method of teaching and Socratic method of teaching.  The transcripts studied represent a variety of topics taught by teachers across different subject areas (Reigeluth, 1983). Collins and Stevens believed that their Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching is domain independent or that it can be applied across subject areas or the curriculum.

== Historical background ==
Inquiry teaching is rooted in the didactic methodologies of the ancient Greek. According Mayer and Alexander (2011), inquiry teaching is rooted in the didactic methodology of the ancient Greek, where the teacher poses a problem and assists the student in solving that problem by asking a series of question. They have also pointed out that this method of instruction can be seen in the works of Plato and Socrates.
Bransford, Franks and Sherwood (1989), as cited by Mayer and Alexander (2011), have indicated that it was not until the 1960s that the role of teachers started to change from where the teacher provided the student with the questions as well as the answers. After the 1960s, instruction provided greater opportunity for students to engage in creating their own answers to questions posed (Mayer &amp; Alexander, 2011).

== Characteristics ==
The purpose of the Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching according to Collins (1986) is to provide learners with the opportunity to “actively engage in articulating theories and principles that are critical to deep understanding of a domain” (p.1). Collins (1986) believes that the knowledge attained will allow the learner to actively and meaningfully engage in solving problems and making predictions.  He also indicated that the knowledge acquire is not simply content knowledge. Figure 1 summarizes Collins and Stevens Theory of Inquiry Teaching.

The Cognitive Theory of Inquiry (Interactive) Teaching according to the Reigeluth (1983) consists of three parts: 
# The teachers goals
# The teaching strategies employed by teachers
# The controlling structures used to govern their teaching.

There are two main goals teachers using the inquiry method seek to achieve, according to Collin and Stevens (1981): 
# The teaching of a particular rule or theory
# Teaching students how to derive the rule or theory.

These two main goals are associated with several sub-goals. The list below identifies the two main goals and their associated sub-goal as posited by Collins and Stevens (1981):
#The teaching of a particular rule or theory
#* Analyzing and addressing misconceptions of students hypotheses
#* Students are taught how to make prediction in new situations
#Teaching students how to derive the rule or theory
#* Students are taught what questions to ask
#* Students are taught the nature of the theory or rule
#* Students are taught how to test the rule or theory
#* Student are taught how to articulate and defend the rule or theory

== Teaching strategies employed by teachers ==
Collins and Stevens (1981) have highlighted ten teaching strategies used by teachers using inquiry teaching. They believed that these ten teaching strategies, listed below, are the most important ones identified in their investigation. These ten teaching strategies identified by Collin and Stevens (1981, p. 18) are:
#Selecting positive and negative exemplars
#Varying cases systematically
#Selecting counterexamples 
#Generating hypothetical cases 
#Forming hypotheses 
#Testing hypotheses 
#Considering alternative predictions 
#Entrapping students 
#Tracing consequences to a contradiction 
#Questioning authority
 
== Controlling structures used to govern their teaching ==
Colling and Stevens (1981) indicated that the time allocated between the teachers' goals and sub-goals is critical to the effectiveness of inquiry teaching. Collins and Stevens (1977), as cited by Collins and Stevens (1981) had made an attempt at developing a theory of controlling structures after getting feedback from several tutors. This controlling structure theory consisted of four parts. The four parts this theory includes the following: 
#"a set of strategies for selecting cases with respect to the main goals,
#a student model,
#an agenda,
#a set of priority rules for adding goals and sub-goals to the agenda." (p. 47)
Collins and Stevens (1981) have suggested that base on the goals of the teacher, cases are selected to ensure that student develop mastery of the principles or theories being taught. They have also indicated that teachers appear to develop some strategies for selecting cases to develop students' mastery of the principles or theories. These are some of the strategies used by teachers for selecting cases as mentioned by Collins and Stevens (1981):
#cases that demonstrated the more important factors were selected before those that have less important factors
#the cases selected were sequenced from concrete factors to abstract factors
#the selection of cases dependent on their importance and frequency: more important or frequent to less important and less frequent
According to Collins and Stevens the controlling structure used to govern the dialogue in the Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching is demonstrated in the following manner:
#A case is chosen, which is a theory or principle, based on the main goal of the teacher. The teacher then questions students to determine their understanding of the theory. Students' answers reveal their understanding or lack of understanding. Next, the teacher tags the theory or principle based what students know, their error and what they do not know. Collins and Stevens referred to this as the students' model.
#Armed with the students' model, the teacher can then add information to facilitate and improve students understanding of what is known. This is determined by the level of sophistication of students' answers.
#Sub-goals are developed to diagnose and address students' errors and misconceptions.
#An agenda is developed prioritizing how students' errors and misconception well be address using the sub-goals developed.
Collins and Stevens (1977), as cited in Collins and Stevens (1981), have identified how priorities have been set by teachers. Priorities have been set based on the following:
#"Errors before omissions.
#Prior steps before later steps.
#Shorter fixes before longer fixes.
#More important factors before less important factors" (p. 49)
Criticism of the Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching
Reigeluth (1983) has put forward the following criticisms about Cognitive Theory of Inquiry:
#He believes that the theory is not suitable for all kinds of content as proposed by Collins and Stevens (1981), who believed that the theory is domain independent and that it can be used to facilitate the development of rules and theories needed for deep understand of the domain. The theory, as he indicated, is more applicable to instruction involving the construction or understanding of rules, principles and theories. The theory may not be suitable for the teaching of facts or concept.
#He believes that the theory is not self-sufficient, in that it requires the use of other forms of instruction to facilitate the development students background information, which is critical to the discovery process proposed by Collins and Stevens (1981)
#The theory may not be efficient in specific rules and principle, particularly those involving algorithms, where an expository approach may be more efficient.

== Conclusion ==
The Collins and Stevens Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching, despite the short coming identified by Reigeluth (1983), provides some strategies for teaching high-order thinking skills. Reigeluth (1983) also points out that the Collins and Stevens Cognitive Theory of Teaching provides some strategies for instruction that other theories have overlooked. Strategies such as considering alternative prediction, entrapping students, tracing consequences to a contradiction and questioning authority are invaluable skill in critical thinking. 
The focus of education today is to develop learners who are independent critical thinkers. There was once the belief that critical thinking skills could not be taught and that these skills develop naturally independent of instruction. The Collins and Stevens Cognitive Theory of Inquiry of Teaching indicate that learners can be taught strategies to develop and apply critical thinking skills.
Dewey (1938), as cited by McGregor (2007), pointed out that if students are provided with factual information without the cognitive skills that would enable them to understand, appreciate, transfer and connect ideas, the information gained would become meaningless in the future. It implies therefore, that instruction should seek to nurture the development of critical thinking skill.
Dewey (1910) as cited by McGregor (2007), has also indicated that there is a connection between thinking and learning. He posited that "thoughts involved in developing ideas and understandings are often assumed and implicated. To develop thoughtful learning these processes need to be more explicit and connected to the processes of coming to know and understand" (p. 47).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34709">The '''conservation and restoration of copper and copper-alloy objects''' is the preservation and protection of objects of historical and personal value made from [[copper]] or [[copper alloy]]. When applied to items of [[cultural heritage]], this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]].

Historically, objects made from copper or copper alloy were created for religious, artistic, technical, military, and domestic uses. The act of [[conservation and restoration]] strives to prevent and slow the deterioration of the object as well as protecting the object for future use. The prevention and removal of surface dirt and corrosion products are the primary concerns of conservator-restorers when dealing with copper or copper-alloy objects.

[[File:Minoan copper ingot from Zakros, Crete.jpg|left|thumb|A corroded copper [[ingot]] from [[Zakros]], [[Crete]], shaped in the form of an animal skin typical in that era.]]
Copper occurs naturally as [[native copper]] and was known to some of the oldest civilizations on record. It has a history of use that is at least 10,000 years old, and estimates of its discovery place it at 9000 BC in the Middle East;&lt;ref name=discovery&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csa.com/discoveryguides/copper/overview.php|title=CSA – Discovery Guides, A Brief History of Copper|publisher=Csa.com|accessdate=2008-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; a copper pendant was found in northern Iraq that dates to 8700 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page = 56|title = Jewelrymaking through History: an Encyclopedia|publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|year = 2007|isbn = 0-313-33507-9|author = Rayner W.

In southeastern Anatolia, all four of these metallurgical techniques appears more or less simultaneously at the beginning of the Neolithic c. 7500 BC.&lt;ref name="Renfrew1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Renfrew|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Renfrew, Baron Renfrew of Kaimsthorn|title=Before civilization: the radiocarbon revolution and prehistoric Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jJhHPgAACAAJ|accessdate=21 December 2011|year=1990|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-013642-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, just as agriculture was independently invented in several parts of the world (including Pakistan, China, and the Americas) copper smelting was invented locally in several different places. It was probably discovered independently in China before 2800 BC, in Central America perhaps around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Cowen, R. |url = http://www.geology.ucdavis.edu/~cowen/~GEL115/115CH3.html|title = Essays on Geology, History, and People, Chapter 3: "Fire and Metals: Copper|accessdate =2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Investment casting]] was invented in 4500–4000 BC in Southeast Asia&lt;ref name=discovery/&gt; and [[carbon dating]] has established mining at [[Alderley Edge Mines|Alderley Edge]] in [[Cheshire]], UK at 2280 to 1890 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Timberlake, S. and Prag A.J.N.W.|year = 2005|title = The Archaeology of Alderley Edge: Survey, excavation and experiment in an ancient mining landscape|location = Oxford|publisher = John and Erica Hedges Ltd.|page = 396}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ötzi the Iceman]], a male dated from 3300–3200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of [[arsenic]] in his hair suggest his involvement in copper smelting.&lt;ref name=CSA&gt;{{cite web|title=CSA – Discovery Guides, A Brief History of Copper|url=http://www.csa.com/discoveryguides/copper/overview.php|work=CSA Discovery Guides|accessdate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting led to the discovery of [[bloomery|iron smelting]].&lt;ref name=CSA /&gt; Production in the [[Old Copper Complex]] in [[Michigan]] and [[Wisconsin]] is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC.&lt;ref name=occ&gt;Pleger, Thomas C.

Previously the only tool made of copper had been the awl, used for punching holes in leather and gouging out peg-holes for wood joining. However, the introduction of a more robust form of copper led to the widespread use, and large-scale production of heavy metal tools, including axes, [[adze]]s, and axe-adzes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Bronze Age===
{{Main|Bronze Age}}
Alloying copper with tin to make bronze was first practiced about 4000 years after the discovery of copper smelting, and about 2000 years after "natural bronze" had come into general use. Bronze artifacts from [[Sumer]]ian cities and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] artifacts of copper and bronze alloys date to 3000 BC.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite book|pages = 13, 48–66|title = Encyclopaedia of the History of Technology|author = McNeil, Ian |publisher = Routledge|year = 2002|location = London ; New York|isbn = 0-203-19211-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bronze Age]] began in Southeastern Europe around 3700 - 3300 BC, in Northwestern Europe about 2500 BC. It ended with the beginning of the Iron Age, 2000-1000 BC in the Near East, 600 BC in Northern Europe. The transition between the [[Neolithic]] period and the Bronze Age was formerly termed the [[Chalcolithic]] period (copper-stone), with copper tools being used with stone tools. This term has gradually fallen out of favor because in some parts of the world the Calcholithic and Neolithic are coterminous at both ends. Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc, is of much more recent origin. It was known to the Greeks, but became a significant supplement to bronze during the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

===Antiquity and Middle Ages===
[[File:Venus symbol.svg|thumb|left|100px|In [[alchemy]] the symbol for copper was also the symbol for the goddess and planet [[Venus]].]]
[[File:TimnaChalcolithicMine.JPG|thumb|Chalcolithic copper mine in [[Timna Valley]], [[Negev Desert]], Israel.]]

In Greece, copper was known by the name ''chalkos'' (χαλκός). It was an important resource for the Romans, Greeks and other ancient peoples. In Roman times, it was known as ''aes Cyprium'', ''aes'' being the generic Latin term for copper alloys and ''Cyprium'' from [[Cyprus]], where much copper was mined. The phrase was simplified to ''cuprum'', hence the English ''copper''. [[Aphrodite]] and [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]] represented copper in mythology and alchemy, because of its lustrous beauty, its ancient use in producing mirrors, and its association with Cyprus, which was sacred to the goddess. The seven heavenly bodies known to the ancients were associated with the seven metals known in antiquity, and Venus was assigned to copper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Nomenclature of Copper and its Alloys|author = Rickard, T. A. |journal = Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute|volume = 62|year = 1932|page=281|jstor = 2843960|doi = 10.2307/2843960|publisher =  Royal Anthropological Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain's first use of brass occurred around the 3rd–2nd century BC. In North America, copper mining began with marginal workings by Native Americans. Native copper is known to have been extracted from sites on [[Isle Royale]] with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The State of Our Knowledge About Ancient Copper Mining in Michigan|journal = The Michigan Archaeologist|volume = 41|page = 119|author = Martin, Susan R. |year = 1995|url = http://www.ramtops.co.uk/copper.html|issue =2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America, particularly in Peru around 1000 AD; it proceeded at a much slower rate on other continents. Copper burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered, but the metal's commercial production did not start until the early 20th century.

The cultural role of copper has been important, particularly in currency. Romans in the 6th through 3rd centuries BC used copper lumps as money. At first, the copper itself was valued, but gradually the shape and look of the copper became more important. [[Julius Caesar]] had his own coins made from brass, while [[Augustus|Octavianus Augustus Caesar]]'s coins were made from Cu-Pb-Sn alloys. With an estimated annual output of around 15,000 t, [[Roman metallurgy|Roman copper mining and smelting activities]] reached a scale unsurpassed until the time of the [[Industrial Revolution]]; the [[Roman province|provinces]] most intensely mined were those of [[Hispania]], [[Cyprus]] and in Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1126/science.272.5259.246|title = History of Ancient Copper Smelting Pollution During Roman and Medieval Times Recorded in Greenland Ice|pages = 246–249 (247f.)|year = 1996|last1 = Hong|first1 = S.|last2 = Candelone|first2 = J.-P.|issue = 5259|last3 = Patterson|first3 = C.

The gates of the [[Temple of Jerusalem]] used [[Corinthian bronze]] made by depletion gilding. It was most prevalent in Alexandria, where alchemy is thought to have begun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.goldbulletin.org/downloads/JACOB_2_33.PDF |title=Corinthian Bronze and the Gold of the Alchemists |author6=Sudhölter, Ernst J.

Ancient Egyptians (~2400 BC) used copper for sterilizing wounds and drinking water, and later on for headaches, burns, and itching. The [[Baghdad Battery]], with copper cylinders soldered to lead, dates back to 248 BC to AD 226 and resembles a galvanic cell, leading people to believe this was the first battery; the claim has not been verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Mysteries – Strange Artifacts, Baghdad Battery|url=http://www.world-mysteries.com/sar_11.htm|work=World-Mysteries.com|accessdate=22 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505154602/http://www.world-mysteries.com/sar_11.htm|archivedate=5 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern period===
[[File:AngleseyCopperStream.jpg|right|thumb|[[Acid mine drainage]] affecting the stream running from the disused [[Parys Mountain]] copper mines]]
The [[Great Copper Mountain]] was a mine in Falun, Sweden, that operated from the 10th century to 1992. It produced two thirds of Europe's copper demand in the 17th century and helped fund many of Sweden's wars during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4yp-x3TzDnEC&amp;pg=PA60|page = 60|title = Mining in World History|isbn = 978-1-86189-173-0|author1 = Lynch, Martin|date = 2004-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was referred to as the nation's treasury; Sweden had a [[History of copper currency in Sweden|copper backed currency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gold: prices, facts, figures and research: A brief history of money|url=http://www.galmarley.com/FAQs_pages/monetary_history_faqs.htm#Scandinavian%20copper%20money|accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The uses of copper in art were not limited to currency: it was used by [[Renaissance]] sculptors, in photographic technology known as the [[daguerreotype]], and the [[Statue of Liberty]]. [[Copper plating]] and [[copper sheathing]] for ships' hulls was widespread; the ships of Christopher Columbus were among the earliest to have this feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Copper History|url = http://www.copperinfo.com/aboutcopper/history.html|accessdate = 2008-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Norddeutsche Affinerie]] in Hamburg was the first modern [[electroplating]] plant starting its production in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1002/adem.200400403|title = Process Optimization in Copper Electrorefining|year = 2004|author = Stelter, M.|journal = Advanced Engineering Materials|volume = 6|issue = 7|page=558|last2 = Bombach|first2 = H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German scientist [[Gottfried Osann]] invented [[powder metallurgy]] in 1830 while determining the metal's atomic mass; around then it was discovered that the amount and type of alloying element (e.g., tin) to copper would affect bell tones. [[Flash smelting]] was developed by [[Outokumpu]] in Finland and first applied at [[Harjavalta]] in 1949; the energy-efficient process accounts for 50% of the world’s primary copper production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outokumpu.com/files/Technology/Documents/Newlogobrochures/FlashSmelting.pdf |title=Outokumpu Flash Smelting |publisher=[[Outokumpu]] |page=2 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724043222/http://www.outokumpu.com/files/Technology/Documents/Newlogobrochures/FlashSmelting.pdf |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries]], formed in 1967 with Chile, Peru, Zaire and Zambia, played a similar role for copper as [[OPEC]] does for oil. It never achieved the same influence, particularly because the second-largest producer, the United States, was never a member; it was dissolved in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karen A.

==Conservation==

===Historical objects===

====Documentation====
Systematic and well-managed documentation is today an essential prerequisite for quality executed conservation and restoration treatments, including documentation of the state of objects before, during and after treatment. Identification of   materials and procedures used to produce  object and the results of any scientific research  must be  part of  documentation too. Last but not least, an integral part of the documentation must be a recommendation for further care of object.

====Research====
*identification of metals,alloys and metallic coatings
*identification of other organic/inorganic materials
*identification of corrosion products and processes
*identification of technology used to produce object

====Decision making====
In preparing the strategy  of the metals conservation project   interdisciplinary approach to the same is  essential.It implies the participation of as many experts as is possible, as a minimum,  we can take  curator (archaeologist, historian, art historian), scientists specialized for corrosion  of metallic objects of cultural heritage and the  conservator - restorer

==Preventive conservation==
The items should be stored in rooms that are protected from polluted air, dust, ultraviolet radiation, and excessive relative humidity - ideal values are temperature of 16-20&amp;nbsp;°C and up to 40%(35-55% according to recent Canadian Conservation Institute recommendations) relative humidity, noting that if metal is combined with organic materials, relative humidity should not be below 45%. Archaeological objects must be stored in rooms (or plastic boxes)with very low relative humidity, or in the case of particularly valuable items in the chambers with nitrogen or argon. Copper or copper alloy objects with active corrosion up to 35% RH. Shelves in the storerooms must be of stainless steel or chlorine and acetate free plastic or powder coated steel. Wood and wood based products(Particle board, plywood) must be avoided. Also do not use rubber, felt or wool .When you are handling metal objects,always wear clean cotton gloves . Lighting levels must be kept below 300 lux (up to 150 lux in case of lacquered or painted objects,up to 50 lux in case of objects with light sensitive materials).

'''[[Custom (law)|Custom]] in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]]''' is the repeated and constant performance of certain acts for a defined period of time, which, with the approval of the competent legislator, thereby acquire the force of law.&lt;ref name=Metz39&gt;Metz, ''What is Canon Law?'', pg. 39&lt;/ref&gt; A custom is an unwritten law introduced by the continuous acts of the faithful with the consent of the legitimate legislator.

Custom may be considered as a fact and as a law. As a fact, it is simply the frequent and free repetition of acts concerning the same thing; as a law, it is the result and consequence of that fact. Hence its name, which is derived from ''consuesco'' or ''consuefacio'' and denotes the frequency of the action. (Cap. Consuetudo v, Dist. I.)

In order for custom to become a source of law, it must be approved by the competent legislator.&lt;ref name=Metz39/&gt; Custom in canon law is not simply created by the people through their constant performance of a certain act,&lt;ref name=Metz39/&gt; but it is the constant performance of a certain act, with the intention of making a custom, which is approved by the competent legislator, thereby acquiring the force of law. This is because of the Catholic ecclesiological teaching on the constitution of the Catholic Church,&lt;ref name=Metz39/&gt; which states that Christ constituted the Church by divine delegation of power to the hierarchical authorities; the Church was not created by the [[consent of the governed]], but by the direct will of Christ.

==Divisions of custom==

* (a) Considered according to extent, a custom is universal, if received by the whole Church; or general (though under another aspect, particular), if observed in an entire country or province; or special, if it obtains among smaller but perfect societies; or most special (''specialissima'') if among private individuals and imperfect societies. The last-named cannot elevate a custom into a legitimate law.
* (b) Considered according to duration, custom is prescriptive or non-prescriptive. The former is subdivided, according to the amount of time requisite for a custom of fact to become a custom of law, into ordinary (i. e. ten or forty years) and immemorial.
* (c) Considered according to method of introduction, a custom is judicial or extrajudicial. The first is that derived from forensic usage or precedent. This is of great importance in ecclesiastical circles, as the same prelates are generally both legislators and judges, i. e. the pope and bishops. Extrajudicial custom is introduced by the people, but its sanction becomes the more easy the larger the number of learned or prominent men who embrace it.
* (d) Considered in its relation to law, a custom is according to law (''juxta legem'') when it interprets or confirms an existing statute; or beside the law (''prœter legem'') when no written legislation on the subject exists; or contrary to law (''contra legem'') when it derogates from or abrogates a statute already in force.

==Legal conditions for custom==

The true efficient cause of an ecclesiastical custom, in as far as it constitutes law, is solely the consent of the competent legislating authority. All church laws imply spiritual jurisdiction, which resides in the hierarchy alone, and, consequently, the faithful have no legislative power, either by Divine right or canonical statute. Therefore, the express or tacit consent of the church authority is necessary to give a custom the force of an ecclesiastical law. This consent is denominated legal when, by general statute and antecedently, reasonable customs receive approbation. Ecclesiastical custom differs, therefore, radically from civil custom. For, though both arise from a certain conspiration and accord between the people and the lawgivers, yet in the Church the entire juridical force of the custom is to be obtained from the consent of the hierarchy while in the civil state, the people themselves are one of the real sources of the legal force of custom. Custom, as a fact, must proceed from the community, or at least from the action of the greater number constituting the community. These actions must be free, uniform, frequent, and public, and performed with the intention of imposing an obligation. The usage, of which there is question. must also be of a reasonable nature. Custom either introduces a new law or abrogates an old one. But a law, by its very concept, is an ordination of reason, and so no law can be constituted by an unreasonable custom. Moreover, as an existing statute cannot be revoked except for just cause, it follows that the custom which is to abrogate the old law must be reasonable, for otherwise the requisite justice would be wanting. A custom, considered as a fact, is unreasonable when it is contrary to Divine law, positive or natural; or when it is prohibited by proper ecclesiastical authority; or when it is the occasion of sin and opposed to the common good.

A custom must also have a legitimate prescription. Such prescription is obtained by a continuance of the act in question during a certain length of time. No canonical statute has positively defined what this length of time is, and so its determination is left to the wisdom of canonists. Authors generally hold that for the legalizing of a custom in accordance with or beside the law (''juxta'' or ''prœter legem'') a space of ten years is sufficient; while for a custom contrary (''contra'') to law many demand a lapse of forty years. The reason given for the necessity of so long a space as forty years is that the community will only slowly persuade itself of the opportuneness of abrogating the old and embracing the new law. The opinion, however, which holds that ten years suffices to establish a custom even contrary to the law may be safely followed. It is to be noted, however, that in practice the Roman Congregations scarcely tolerate or permit any custom, even an immemorial one, contrary to the sacred canons. (Cf. Gasparri, De Sacr. Ordin., n. 53, 69 sq.) In the introduction of a law by prescription, it is assumed that the custom was introduced in good faith, or at least through ignorance of the opposite law. If, however, a custom be introduced through connivance (''viâ conniventiœ''), good faith is not required, for, as a matter of fact, bad faith must, at least in the beginning, be presupposed. As, however, when there is question of connivance, the proper legislator must know of the formation of the custom and yet does not oppose it when he could easily do so, the contrary law is then supposed to be abrogated directly by the tacit revocation of the legislator. A custom which is contrary to good morals or to the natural or Divine positive law is always to be rejected as an abuse, and it can never be legalized.

==Force of custom==

The effects of a custom vary with the nature of the act which has caused its introduction, i. e. according as the act is in accord with (''juxta''), or beside (''prœter''), or contrary (''contra'') to, the written law.

* (a) The first (''juxta legem'') does not constitute a new law in the strict sense of the word; its effect is rather to confirm and strengthen an already existing statute or to interpret it. Hence the axiom of jurists: Custom is the best interpreter of laws. Custom, indeed, considered as a fact, is a witness to the true sense of a law and to the intention of the legislator. If, then, it bring about that a determinate sense be obligatorily attached to an indeterminate legal phrase, it takes rank as an authentic interpretation of the law and as such acquires true binding-force. Wernz (Jus Decretalium, n. 191) refers to this same principle as explaining why the oft-recurring phrase in ecclesiastical documents, "the existing discipline of the Church, approved by the Holy See", indicates a true norm and an obligatory law.
* (b) The second species of custom (''prœter legem'') has the force of a new law, binding upon the entire community both in the internal and external forum. Unless a special exception can be proved, the force of such a custom extends to the introduction of prohibitive, permissive, and preceptive statutes, as well as to penal and nullifying enactments.
* (c) Thirdly, a custom contrary (''contra'') to law has the effect of abrogating, entirely or in part, an already existing ordinance, for it has the force of a new and later law. As regards penal ecclesiastical legislation, such a custom may directly remove an obligation in conscience, while the duty of submission to the punishment for transgressing the old precept may remain, provided the punishment in question be not a censure nor so severe a chastisement as necessarily presupposes a grave fault. On the other hand, this species of custom may also remove the punishment attached to a particular law, while the law itself remains obligatory as to its observance.

Immemorial custom, provided it be shown that circumstances have so changed as to make the custom reasonable, has power to abrogate or change any human law, even though a clause had been originally added to it forbidding any custom to the contrary. To immemorial custom is also attached the unusual force of inducing a presumption of the existence of an Apostolic privilege, provided the said privilege be not reckoned among abuses, and the holder of the presumed privilege be a person legally capable of acquiring the thing in question without first obtaining a special and express Apostolic permission for it (cf. Wernz, op. cit., who has been followed particularly in this paragraph). Ferraris notes that no immemorial custom, if it be not confirmed by Apostolic privilege, express or presumptive, can have any force for the abrogation of ecclesiastical liberties or immunities, inasmuch as both canon and civil law declare such custom to be unreasonable by its very nature. In general, it may be said that a valid custom, in both the constitution and the abrogation of laws, produces the same effects as a legislative act.

==Concerning Tridentine decrees==

A special question has been raised by some canonists as to whether the laws of the Council of Trent may be changed or abrogated by custom, even if immemorial, or whether all such contrary customs should not be rejected as abuses. Some of these writers restrict their denial of the value of contrary customs to ordinary, some also to immemorial ones (cf. Lucidi, De Vis. Sac. Lim., I, ch. iii, n. 111). It is unquestionably a general principle in canon law, that custom can change the disciplinary statutes even of œcumenical councils. The main reason for rejecting this principle in favour of the Tridentine enactments in particular is that any contrary custom would certainly be unreasonable and therefore unjustifiable. It is by no means evident, however, that all such contrary customs must necessarily be unreasonable, as is plain from the fact that some authors allow and others deny the value of immemorial customs in the premises, even when they agree in reprobating the force of ordinary customs. As a matter of fact, there is no decree of the Sacred Congregation of the Council which declares, absolutely and generally, that all customs contrary to the laws of the Council of Trent are invalid. Moreover, the Tribunal of the Rota has allowed the force of immemorial customs contrary to the disciplinary decrees of Trent, and the Sacred Congregation of the Council has at least tolerated them in secondary matters. A salient instance of the Roman official view is the statement of the Holy Office (11 March 1868) that the Tridentine decree on clandestine marriages, even after promulgation, was abrogated in some regions by contrary custom (Collect. S. C. de Prop. Fid., n. 1408). The confirmation of the Council of Trent by Pope Pius IV (26 Jan., 1564; 17 Feb., 1565) abolishes, it is true, all contrary existing customs, but the papal letters contain nothing to invalidate future customs. Owing to the comparatively recent date of the Council of Trent and the urgency of the Holy See that its decrees be observed, it is not easy for a contrary custom to arise, but whenever the conditions of a legitimate custom are fulfilled, there is no reason why the Tridentine decrees should be more immune than those of any other œcumenical council (cfr. Laurentius, op. cit., below, n. 307).

==Cessation of custom==

Any custom is to be rejected whose existence as such cannot be proved legally. A custom is a matter of fact, and therefore its existence must be tested in the same way as the existence of other alleged facts is tested. In this particular, the decrees of synods, the testimony of the diocesan ordinary and of other persons worthy of credence are of great value. Proofs are considered the stronger the more closely they approximate public and official monuments. If there be a question of proving an immemorial custom, the witnesses must be able to affirm that they themselves have been cognizant of the matter at issue for a space of at least forty years, that they have heard it referred to by their progenitors as something always observed, and that neither they nor their fathers have ever been aware of any fact to the contrary. If the fact of the existence of an alleged custom is not sufficiently proved, it is to be rejected as constituting a source of law. Customs may be revoked by a competent ecclesiastical legislator, in the same way and for the same reasons as other ordinances are abrogated. A later general law contrary to a general custom will nullify the latter, but a particular custom will not be abrogated by a general law, unless a clause to that effect be inserted. Even such a nullifying clause will not be sufficient for the abrogation of immemorial customs. The latter must be mentioned explicitly, for they are held not to be included in any general legal phrase, however sweeping its terms may be. Customs may likewise be abrogated by contrary customs, or they may lose their legal force by the mere fact that they fall into desuetude. Finally, an authentic declaration that a custom is absolutely contrary to good morals (''rumpens nervum disciplinœ'') and detrimental to the interests of the hierarchy or of the faithful deprives it of its supposed legal value.

'''''De re metallica''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for ''On the Nature of Metals'' [''Minerals'']) is a book cataloguing the state of the art of [[mining]], [[Refining (metallurgy)|refining]], and [[smelting]] [[metals]], published a year posthumously in 1556 due to a delay in preparing woodcuts for the text. The author was Georg Bauer, whose pen name was the Latinized [[Georgius Agricola]]. The book remained the authoritative text on mining for 180 years after its publication. It was also an important chemistry text for the period and is significant in the history of chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;

Mining was typically left to professionals, craftsmen and experts who were not eager to share their knowledge. Much experiential knowledge had been accumulated over the course of time. This knowledge was consecutively handed down orally within a small group of technicians and mining overseers. In the Middle Ages these people held the same leading role as the master builders of the great cathedrals, or perhaps also alchemists. It was a small, cosmopolitan elite within which existing knowledge was passed on and further developed but not shared with the outside world. Only a few writers from that time wrote anything about mining itself. Partly, that was because this knowledge was very difficult to access. Most writers also found it simply not worth the effort to write about it. Only in the Renaissance did this perception begin to change. With the improved transport and the [[movable type|invention of the printing press]] knowledge spread much more easily and faster than before. In 1500, the first printed book dedicated to mining engineering, called the ''Nutzlich Bergbuchleyn'' (The Useful Little Mining Book”) by Ulrich Rulein von Calw, was published. The most important works in this genre were, however, the twelve books of ''De Re Metallica'' by Georgius Agricola, published in 1556.

Agricola had spent nine years in the [[Bohemia]]n town of [[Joachimsthal]], now in the [[Czech Republic]]. ([[Joachimsthal]] is famous for its silver mines and the origin of the word "[[Thaler]]" and, ultimately, "[[dollar]].") After Joachimsthal, he spent the rest of his life in [[Chemnitz]], a prominent mining town in [[Saxony]]. Both Joachimsthal and Chemnitz are in the [[Erzgebirge]], or [[Ore Mountains (Germany)|Ore Mountains]].

The book was greatly influential, and for more than a century after it was published, ''De Re Metallica'' remained a standard treatise used throughout Europe.  The German mining technology it portrayed was acknowledged as the most advanced at the time, and the metallic wealth produced in German mining districts was the envy of many other European nations. The book was reprinted in a number of Latin editions, as well as in German and Italian translations. Publication in Latin meant that it could be read by any educated European of the time. The numerous woodcuts and detailed descriptions of machinery made it a practical reference for those wishing to replicate the latest in mining technology.&lt;ref&gt;Eric H. Ash, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IfyHKqKewugC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=%22de+re+metallica%22+bauer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PITBUq_aG8S8yAHFvoHICw&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22de%20re%20metallica%22%20bauer&amp;f=false Power, Knowledge, and Expertise in Elizabethan England] (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2004) 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, the first English [[translation]] of ''De Re Metallica'' was privately published in [[London]] by subscription. The translators were [[Herbert Hoover]], a mining engineer (and later [[President of the United States]]), and his wife, [[Lou Henry Hoover]], a geologist and Latinist. The translation is notable not only for its clarity of language, but for the extensive footnotes, which detail the classical references to mining and metals. Subsequent translations into other languages, including German, owe much to the Hoover translations, as their footnotes detail their difficulties with Agricola's invention of several hundred Latin expressions to cover Medieval German mining and milling terms that were unknown to classical Latin. The most important translation—outside English—was the one published by the [[Deutsches Museum]] in Munich.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Agricola, Zwolf Bücher vom Berg- und Hüttenwesen, (Berlin 1928).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

[[File:Agricola1.jpg|thumb|right|A water-powered [[mine hoist]] used for raising ore]]
The book consists of a preface and twelve chapters, labelled books I to XII, without titles. It also has numerous woodcuts that provide annotated diagrams illustrating equipment and processes described in the text.

===Preface===

Agricola addresses the book to prominent German aristocrats, the most important of whom were [[Maurice, Elector of Saxony]] and his brother Augustus, who were his main patrons. He then describes the works of ancient and contemporary writers on mining and metallurgy, the chief ancient source being [[Pliny the Elder]]. Agricola describes several books contemporary to him, the chief being a booklet by Calbus of Freiberg in German. The works of alchemists are then described. Agricola does not reject the idea of alchemy, but notes that alchemical writings are obscure and that we do not read of any of the masters who became rich. He then describes fraudulent alchemists, who deserve the death penalty. Agricola completes his introduction by explaining that, since no other author has described the art of metals completely, he has written this work, setting forth his scheme for twelve books. Finally, he again directly addresses his audience of German princes, explaining the wealth that can be gained from this art.

===Book I: Arguments for and against this art===

This book consists of the arguments used against the art and Agricola's counter arguments. He explains that mining and prospecting are not just a matter of luck and hard work; there is specialized knowledge that must be learned. A miner should have knowledge of [[philosophy]], [[medicine]], [[astronomy]], [[surveying]], [[arithmetic]], [[architecture]], [[drawing]] and [[law]], though few are masters of the whole craft and most are specialists. This section is full of classical references and shows Agricola's classical education to its fullest. The arguments range from philosophical objections to gold and silver as being intrinsically worthless, to the danger of mining to its workers and its destruction of the areas in which it is carried out. He argues that without metals, no other activity such as architecture or agriculture are possible. The dangers to miners are dismissed, noting that most deaths and injuries are caused by carelessness, and other occupations are hazardous too. Clearing woods for fuel is advantageous as the land can be farmed. Mines tend to be in mountains and gloomy valleys with little economic value. The loss of food from the forests destroyed can be replaced by purchase from profits, and metals have been placed underground by God and man is right to extract and use them. Finally, Agricola argues that mining is an honorable and profitable occupation.

===Book II: The miner and a discourse on the finding of veins===

This book describes the miner and the finding of veins. Agricola assumes that his audience is the mine owner, or an investor in mines. He advises owners to live at the mine and to appoint good deputies. It is recommended to buy shares in mines that have not started to produce as well as existing mines to balance the risks. The next section of this book recommends areas where miners should search. These are generally mountains with wood available for fuel and a good supply of water. A navigable river can be used to bring fuel, but only gold or gemstones can be mined if no fuel is available. The roads must be good and the area healthy. Agricola describes searching streams for metals and gems that have been washed from the veins. He also suggests looking for exposed veins and also describes the effects of metals on the overlying vegetation. He recommends trenching to investigate veins beneath the surface. He then describes [[dowsing]] with a forked twig although he rejects the method himself. Finally he comments on the practice of naming veins or shafts.

===Book III: Veins and stringers and seams in the rocks===

This book is a description of the various types of veins that can be found. There are 30 illustrations of different forms of these veins, forming the majority of Book III.  Agricola also describes a compass to determine the direction of veins and mentions that some writers claim that veins lying in certain directions are richer, although he provides counter-examples. He also mentions the theory that the sun draws the metals in veins to the surface, although he himself doubts this. Finally he explains that gold is not generated in the beds of streams and rivers and east-west streams are not more productive than others inherently. Gold occurs in streams because it is torn from veins by the water.

===Book IV: Delimiting veins and the functions of mining officials===

This book describes how an official, the ''[[Bergmeister]]'', is in charge of mining. He marks out the land into areas called ''meers'' when a vein is discovered. The rest of the book covers the laws of mining. There is a section on how the mine can be divided into shares. The roles of various other officials in regulating mines and taxing the production are stated. The shifts of the miners are fixed. The chief trades in the mine are listed and are regulated by both the Bergmeister and their foremen.

===Book V: The digging of ore and the surveyor's art===

This book covers underground mining and surveying. When a vein below ground is to be exploited a shaft is begun and a wooden shed with a windlass is placed above it. The tunnel dug at the bottom follows the vein and is just big enough for a man. The entire vein should be removed. Sometimes the tunnel eventually connects with a tunnel mouth in a hill side. Stringers and cross veins should be explored with cross tunnels or shafts when they occur. Agricola next describes that gold, silver, copper and mercury can be found as native metals, the others very rarely. Gold and silver ores are described in detail. Agricola then states that it is rarely worthwhile digging for other metals unless the ores are rich. Gems are found in some mines, but rarely have their own veins, lodestone is found in iron mines and [[emery (mineral)|emery]] in silver mines. Various minerals and colours of earths can be used to give indications of the presence of metal ores. The actual mineworking varies with the hardness of the rock, the softest is worked with a pick and requires shoring with wood, the hardest is usually broken with fire. Iron wedges, hammers and crowbars are used to break other rocks. Noxious gases and the ingress of water are described. Methods for lining tunnels and shafts with timber are described. The book concludes with a long treatise on surveying, showing the instruments required and techniques for determining the course of veins and tunnels. Surveyors allow veins to be followed, but also prevent mines removing ore from other claims and stop mine workings from breaking into other workings.

===Book VI: The miners' tools and machines===
[[File:Leitnagel Hund (Mining cart).png|thumbnail|250px|right|[[Minecart]] shown in ''[[De Re Metallica]]'' (1556). The iron guide pin fits in a groove between two wooden planks.  Railroads descended from [[minecart]]s.]]
This book is extensively illustrated and describes the tools and machinery associated with mining. Handtools and different sorts of buckets, wheelbarrows and trucks on wooded plankways are described. Packs for horses and sledges are used to carry loads above ground. Agricola then provides details of various kinds of machines for lifting weights. Some of these are man-powered and some powered by up to four horses or by waterwheels. Horizontal drive shafts along tunnels allow lifting in shafts not directly connected to the surface. If this is not possible treadmills will be installed underground. Instead of lifting weights similar machines use chains of buckets to lift water. Agricola also describes several designs of piston force pumps which are either man or animal powered or powered by waterwheels. Because these pumps can only lift water about 24 feet, batteries of pumps are required for the deepest mines. Water pipe designs are also covered in this section. Designs of wind scoop for ventilating shafts or forced air using fans or bellows are also described. Finally ladders and lifts using wicker cages are used to get miners up and down shafts.

===Book VII: On the assaying of ore===

This book deals with assaying techniques. Various designs of furnaces are detailed. Then [[cupellation]], [[crucibles]], [[Cubicle#Post Medieval|scorifier]]s and [[muffle furnace]]s are described. The correct method of preparation of the cupels is covered in detail with beech ashes being preferred. Various other additives and formulae are described, but Agricola does not judge between them. Triangular crucibles and scorifiers are made of fatty clay with a temper of ground-up crucibles or bricks. Agricola then describes in detail which substances should be added as fluxes as well as lead for smelting or assaying. The choice is made by which colour the ore burns out which gives an indication of the metals present. The lead should be silver-free or be assayed separately. The prepared ore is wrapped in paper, placed on a scorifier and then placed under a muffle covered in burning charcoal in the furnace. The cupel should be heated at the same time. The scorifier is removed and the metal transferred to the cupel. Alternatively the ore can be smelted in a triangular crucible, and then have lead mixed with it when it is added to the cupel.  The cupel is placed in the furnace and copper is separated into the lead which forms lithage in the cupel leaving the noble metal. Gold and silver are parted using an aqua which is probably nitric acid. Agricola describes precautions for ensuring the amount of lead is correct and also describes the amalgamation of gold with mercury. Assay techniques for base metals such as tin are described as well as techniques for alloys such as silver tin. The use of a touchstone to assay gold and silver is discussed. Finally detailed arithmetical examples show the calculations needed to give the yield from the assay.

===Book VIII: Roasting, crushing and washing ore===

In this book Agricola provides a detailed account of beneficiation of different ores. He describes the processes involved in ore sorting, roasting and crushing. The use of water for washing ores is discussed in great detail, e.g. the use of launders and washing tables. Several different types of machinery for crushing ore and washing it are illustrated and different techniques for different metals and different regions are described. 
[[File:Agricola01.jpg|thumb|left|Smelting ore, a woodcut from the book]]

===Book IX: Methods of smelting ores===

This book describes smelting, which Agricola describes as perfecting the metal by fire. The design of furnaces is first explained.
These are very similar for smelting different metals, constructed of brick or soft stone with a brick front and mechanically driven bellows at the rear. At the front is a pit called the fore-hearth to receive the metal. The furnace is charged with beneficiated ore and crushed charcoal and lit. In some gold and silver smelting a lot of slag is produced because of the relative poverty of the ore and the tap hole has to be opened at various times to remove different slag materials. When the furnace is ready, the forehearth is filled with molten lead into which the furnace is tapped. In other furnaces the smelting can be continuous, and lead is placed into the furnace if there is none in the ore. The slag is skimmed off the top of the metal as it is tapped. The lead containing the gold is separated by cupellation, the metal rich slags are re-smelted. Other smelting processes are similar, but lead is not added. Agricola also describes making crucible steel and distilling mercury and bismuth in this book.

===Book X: Separating silver from gold and lead from gold or silver===

Agricola describes parting silver from gold in this book by using acids. He also describes heating with antimony sulphide (stibium), which would give silver sulphide and a mixture of gold and antimony. The gold and silver can then be recovered with cupellation. Gold can also be parted using salts or using mercury. Large scale cupellation using a cupellation hearth is also covered in this book

===Book XI: Separating silver from copper===

This book describes separating silver from copper or iron. This is achieved by adding large amounts of lead at a temperature just above the melting point of lead. The lead will liquate out with the silver. This process will need to be repeated several times. The lead and silver can be separated by cupellation.

===Book XII: Manufacturing salt, soda, alum, vitriol, sulphur, bitumen, and glass===

This describes the preparation of what Agricola calls "juices": [[salt]], [[Sodium carbonate|soda]], [[nitre]], [[alum]], [[vitriol]], [[saltpetre]], [[sulphur]] and [[bitumen]]. Finally glass making is covered. Agricola seems less secure about this process. He is not clear about making glass from the raw ingredients but clearer about remelting glass to make objects.

Prof. Philippus Bechius (1521–1560), a friend of Agricola, translated ''De re metallica libri XII'' into German. It was published with the German title ''Vom Bergkwerck XII Bücher'' in 1557.

==Publication history==

Although Agricola died in 1555, the publication was delayed until the completion of the extensive and detailed [[woodcut]]s.{{when|date=August 2017}}

In 1912, the first English [[translation]] of ''De Re Metallica'' was privately published in [[London]] by subscription. The translators were [[Herbert Hoover]], a mining engineer (and later [[President of the United States]]), and his wife, [[Lou Henry Hoover]], a geologist and Latinist. The translation is notable not only for its clarity of language, but for the extensive footnotes, which detail the classical references to mining and metals, such as the ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]], the history of [[mining law]] in England, France, and the German states; safety in mines, including historical safety; and known [[minerals]] at the time that Agricola wrote ''De Re Metallica.'' This translation has been reprinted by [[Dover Books]].

Subsequent translations into other languages, including German, owe much to the Hoover translations, as their footnotes detail their difficulties with Agricola's invention of several hundred Latin expressions to cover Medieval German mining and milling terms unknown to classical Latin.

'''Donata Premeru''' (born June 4, 1934 in [[Yugoslavia]]) is a [[musicologist]], [[broadcasting|broadcaster]], [[Lyricist|music writer]], [[journalist]], [[lecturer]] and historian of Arts.

==Biography and career==
After graduation at [[Musicology and History of Arts in Zagreb]] ([[Croatia]]), she did postgraduate studies of Early and Contemporary Music at [[London University]] ([[UK]]). Donata started as student lecturer and broadcaster at [[Radio Zagreb]] and continued as Music Editor of Stereorama programme on [[Radio Belgrade]]. In 1965 she was invited to start the Radio Beograd Third Programme (music section) as its first musicologist, and in 1983 its first stereo weekend Music Programme [[Stereorama]], which was closed down in November 2015, while celebrating the 50th anniversary of its III Programme.

One of the most acclaimed broadcasts of her ''Music Matters'' (''Muzika s povodom''), often thematically or in cycles: "European Cities of Culture 1985-2012"; "Early Music Centers in the 17th and 18th-century – from Venice to Mannheim"; "Entartete Musik series"; "Tragically Ended Careers of Young Musicians"; "Contemporary Music Scene Worldwide; Women Composers 2000-2012 (more than 200 names)"; "Unknown/Forgotten Composers of the 20th Century"; "Romantic Piano Concertos"; "Composers of the 21st Century"; "Dialogues – between Early and Contemporary Music"; "Notable Anniversaries"; "Writers in Music"; "Accordion on the classical music scene XIX-XXI century"; "Music written for film"; etc.

The composer, writer and artist [[Dušan Radić]] (1929-2010) in his book ''Tragovi balkanske vrleti-vreme-život-muzika'' (2007) dedicated a whole section (p.&amp;nbsp;107-114) to Donata Premeru and her broadcast programme ''Music Matters''. For after 20 years of his absence from the musical scene, she interrupted this silence and invited him in her radio programme regarding his 75th birthday on April 10, 2004. In 2016, book ''Film and Music – Temptations of great composers'' – based on 14 radio programmes – was published with her guest, [[Borislav Stojkov]].

[[File:Display of Procesional Crosses, Church of Bet Maryam, Lalibela, Ethiopia (3230772118).jpg|thumb|[[Bet Maryam]] church, [[Lalibela]]. Traditional Ethiopian church art]]
'''Ethiopian art''' from the 4th century until the 20th can be divided into two broad groupings. First comes a distinctive tradition of [[Christianity|Christian]] art, mostly for churches, in forms including [[painting]], [[Ethiopian cross|crosses]], [[icons]], [[illuminated manuscripts]], and other metalwork such as crowns.  Secondly there are popular arts and crafts such as textiles, [[basketry]] and [[jewellery]], in which Ethiopian traditions are closer to those of other peoples in the region. [[History of Ethiopia|Its history]] goes back almost three thousand years to the kingdom of [[D'mt]]. The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] has been the predominant religion in Ethiopia for over 1500 years, for most of this period in a very close relation, or union, with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christianity]] of [[Egypt]], so that [[Coptic art]] has been the main formative influence on Ethiopian church art.

==Overview==
[[File:Lalibela Bet Maryam 1 (28397479782).jpg|thumb|The rock-hewn Church of Bet Maryam in Lalibela.]]
Prehistoric [[rock art]] comparable to that of other African sites survives in a number of places, and until the arrival of Christianity stone [[stela]]e, often carved with simple reliefs, were erected as grave-markers and for other purposes in many regions; [[Tiya]] is one important site. The "pre-Axumite" [[Iron Age]] culture of about the 5th century BCE to the 1st century CE was influenced by the [[Kingdom of Kush]] to the north, and settlers from [[Arabia]], and produced cities with simple temples in stone, such as the ruined one at [[Yeha]], which is impressive for its date in the 4th or 5th century BCE.

The powerful [[Kingdom of Aksum]] emerged in the 1st century BCE and dominated Ethiopia until the 10th century, having become very largely Christian from the 4th century.&lt;ref name="Biasio"&gt;Biasio&lt;/ref&gt; Although some buildings and large, pre-Christian [[Stele|stelae]] exist, there appears to be no surviving Ethiopian Christian art from the Axumite period. However the earliest works remaining show a clear continuity with Coptic art of earlier periods. There was considerable destruction of churches and their contents in the 16th century when the country was invaded by Muslim neighbours. The revival of art after this was influenced by Catholic European art in both iconography and elements of style, but retained its Ethiopian character. In the 20th century, Western artists and architects began to be commissioned by the government, and to train local students, and more fully Westernized art was produced alongside continuations of traditional church art.&lt;ref name="Biasio"/&gt;

==Types==

===Painting===
[[File:WLA ima Ethiopian processional Christian cross.jpg|right|thumb|Brass Ethiopian processional cross with silver plating]]
Church paintings in Ethiopia were likely produced as far back as the [[Christianity in Ethiopia|introduction of Christianity]] in the 4th century AD,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://smarthistory.org/christian-ethiopian-art/|title=Christian Ethiopian art|date=2016-12-22|work=Smarthistory|access-date=2017-07-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the earliest surviving examples come from the church of Debre Selam Mikael in the [[Tigray Region]], dated to the 11th century AD.&lt;ref name="teferi 2015 242"&gt;{{citation|first=Dawit|last=Teferi|editor-first=Philip|editor-last=Briggs|title=Ethiopia|chapter=A Short History of Ethiopian Church Art|year=2015|orig-year=1995|location=Chalfont St Peter|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-922-3|page=242|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gU_fCgAAQBAJ|postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 7th-century AD followers of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] who fled to [[Axum]] in temporary exile mentioned that the original [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]] was decorated with paintings.&lt;ref name="teferi 2015 242"/&gt; Other early paintings include those from the [[Rock-cut architecture|rock-hewn]] churches of [[Lalibela]], dated to the 12th century AD, and in nearby Geneta Maryam, dated to the 13th century AD.&lt;ref name="teferi 2015 242"/&gt; However, paintings in [[illuminated manuscript]]s predate the earliest surviving church paintings; for instance, the Ethiopian [[Garima Gospels]] of the 4th-6th centuries AD contain [[Christian art|illuminated scenes]] imitating the contemporary [[Byzantine art|Byzantine style]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=De Lorenzi|first=James|title=Guardians of the Tradition: Historians and Historical Writing in Ethiopia and Eritrea|location=Rochester|publisher=[[University of Rochester Press]]|year=2015|isbn=978-1-58046-519-9|pages=15–16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1WECgAAQBAJ| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethiopian painting, on walls, in books, and in [[icon]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/ethiopian-icons-catalogue-of-the-collection-of-the-institute-of-ethiopian-studies-addis-ababa-university/oclc/848786240&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Ethiopian icons: catalogue of the collection of the Institute of Ethiopian studies, Addis Ababa university|last5=Chojnacki|first5=Stanley|publisher=Skira|year=2000|isbn=8881186462|location=Milano|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; is highly distinctive, though the style and [[iconography]] are closely related to the simplified Coptic version of Late Antique and Byzantine Christian art. It is typified by simplistic, almost cartoonish, figures with large, almond-shaped, eyes. Colours are usually bright and vivid. The majority of paintings are religious in nature, often decorating church walls and bibles. One of the best known examples of this type of painting is at Debre Berhan Selassie in [[Gondar]] (pictured), famed for its [[angel]]-covered roof (angels in Ethiopian art are often represented as winged heads) as well as its other murals dating from the late 17th century. [[Diptych]]s and [[triptych]]s are also commonly painted with religious icons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethiopia, its Art and Icons|url=http://www.betsyporter.com/Ethiopia.html|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 16th century, [[Roman Catholic church art]] and European art in general began to exert some influence. However, Ethiopian art is highly conservative and retained much of its distinct character until modern times. The production of [[illuminated manuscripts]] for use continued up to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Ross&lt;/ref&gt; Pilgrimages to Jerusalem, where there has long been an Ethiopian clerical presence, also allowed some contact with a wider range of Orthodox art.

Churches may be very fully painted, although until the 19th century there is little sign of secular painting other than scenes commemorating the life of donors to churches on their walls. Unusually for [[Orthodox Christianity]], icons were not usually kept in houses (where talimanic scrolls were often kept instead), but in the church. Some "diptyches" are in the form of a "ark" or ''[[tabot]]'', in these cases consecrated boxes with a painted inside of the lid, placed closed on the altar during Mass, somewhat equivalent to the [[altar stone]] in the Western church, and the [[antimins]] in other Orthodox churches.  These are regarded as so holy that the laity is not allowed to see them, and they are wrapped in cloth when taken in procession.

Ethiopian [[diptych]]s often have a primary wing with a frame. A smaller second wing, which is only the size of the image within the frame, is painted on both sides to allow closed and open views. Icons are painted on a wood base support, but since about the 16th century with an intervening cloth support glued to a [[gesso]] layer above the wood. The binding medium for the paint is also animal-based glue, giving a matt finish which is then often [[varnish]]ed. A range of mostly mineral pigments are used, giving a palette based on reds, yellow and blues. Underdrawing was used, which may remain visible or reinforced by painted edges to areas of colour in the final layer.

From the 15th century the [[Theotokos]] or [[Virgin Mary]], with or without her Child, became increasingly popular. They used versions of a number of common Byzantine types, typically flanked by two [[archangel]]s in iconic depictions. She is often depicted with a neighbouring image of a mounted [[Saint George and the Dragon]], who in Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity is regarded as especially linked to Mary, for carrying messages or intervening in human affairs on her behalf.

===Crosses and other metalwork===
[[File:Detail, Ethiopian Crown (2130218640).jpg|thumb|right|Royal crown in the [[National Museum of Ethiopia]]]]
Another important form of Ethiopian art, also related to Coptic styles, are crosses made from wood and metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/ethiopian-crosses-a-cultural-history-and-chronology/oclc/838853616|title=Ethiopian crosses: a cultural history and chronology|last=Chojnacki|first=Stanisław|last2=Gossage|first2=Carolyn|date=2006|publisher=Skira|isbn=8876248315|location=Milan|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Maria Evangelatou. 2017. ''A Contextual Reading of Ethiopian Crosses Through Form and Ritual Kaleidoscopes of Meaning''. (Gorgias Eastern Christian Studies.) St. Gorgias Press.&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually [[copper alloy]] or [[brass]], plated (at least originally) with gold or silver. The heads are typically flat [[casting|cast]] plates with elaborate and complex [[openwork]] decoration. The cross motif emerges from the decoration, with the whole design often forming a rotated square or circular shape, though the designs are highly varied and inventive. Many incorporate curved motifs rising from the base, which are called the "arms of [[Adam]]". Except in recent Western-influenced examples, they usually have no ''corpus'', or figure of Christ, and the design often incorporates numerous smaller crosses.  Engraved figurative imagery has sometimes been added.  Crosses are mostly either [[processional cross]]es, with the metal head mounted on a long wooden staff, carried in religious processions and during the [[liturgy]], or hand crosses, with a shorter metal handle in the same casting as the head. Smaller crosses worn as jewellery are also common.

The [[Lalibela Cross]] is an especially venerated hand cross, perhaps of the 12th century, which was stolen from a church in [[Lalibela]] in 1997 and eventually recovered and returned from a [[Belgian]] collector in 2001.

Distinctive forms of crown were worn in ceremonial contexts by royalty and important noble officials, as well as senior clergy. Royal crowns rose high, with a number of circular bands, while church crowns often resemble an elongated version of the typical European closed crown, with four arms joined at the top and surmounted by a cross.

===Other arts and crafts===
[[File:Axumite Jar Spout (2822628227).jpg|thumb|A jar spout from the ancient [[Kingdom of Aksum]]]]
Ethiopia has great ethnic and linguistic diversity, and styles in secular traditional crafts vary greatly in different parts of the country. There are a range of traditions in textiles, many with woven geometric decoration, although many types are also usually plain. Ethiopian church practices make a great deal of use of colourful textiles, and the more elaborate types are widely used as church vestments and as hangings, curtains and wrappings in churches, although they have now largely been supplanted by Western fabrics. Examples of both types can be seen in the picture at the top of the article.  Icons may normally be veiled with a semi-transparent or opaque cloth; very thin [[chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]]-type cotton cloth is a speciality of Ethiopia, though usually with no pattern.

Colourful basketry with a coiled construction is common in rural Ethiopia. The products have many uses, such as storing grains, seeds and food and being used as tables and bowls. The Muslim city of [[Harar]] is well known for its high quality basketry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethiopian Handicraft|url=http://www.ethiopianhandicraft-femseda.org/home3.htm|accessdate=22 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701023243/http://www.ethiopianhandicraft-femseda.org/home3.htm|archivedate=1 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many craft products of the Muslim minority relate to wider Islamic decorative traditions.

{{News release|date=May 2012}}
'''Greenhouse debt''' is the measure to which an individual person, incorporated association, business enterprise, government instrumentality or / [and] (per Neb., USA) geographic community exceeds its permitted [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse]] [[ecological footprint|footprint]] and contributes [[greenhouse gas]]es that contribute to [[global warming]] and [[climate change]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The concept makes no sense without a clear numerical value for the permitted [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse]] [[ecological footprint|footprint]]. It is not clear what this value is.

[[Friends of the Earth]] and similar organisations put forward the concept to define specifically the environmental harm caused by developed countries' past and present policies.&lt;ref&gt;Friends of the Earth International. 2000. "Greenhouse debt".  ''Link'' (20):  http://www.foei.org/en/publications/link/92/e92greenhouse_debt.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some governments, at least the Australian [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] leadership, have a tendency to accept such a line of reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Hamilton, "We will all pay for Howard's hidden greenhouse debt", Crikey, Friday, 14 December 2007: http://www.crikey.com.au/Politics/20071214-Howards-Hidden-Greenhouse-Debt-.html?CurrentDate=14+%2F+01+%2F+2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The greenhouse debt assessment thus forms an [[ecological footprint]] analysis but can be used separately. Taken conjointly with a 'water debt' [[needs assessment|analysis]] and an [[environmental impact assessment|ecological impact assessment]], greenhouse debt analysis is basic to giving individuals, organisations, governments and communities an understanding of the effects they are having on [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia]], [[life]], and [[global warming]].  

Ensuring that the greenhouse debt is zero is essential towards achieving [[ecologically sustainable development]] or a [[sustainable retreat]]. Any greenhouse debt incurred will contribute to making life harder for future generations of humans and [[non-human]] lifeforms.

There are three possible consequences that occur as a result of a greenhouse debt.

#''[[Mitigation of global warming|Mitigation]]:'' finding compensatory ways of reducing the greenhouse debt so its effects are neutralised
#''[[Adaptation]]:'' finding ways of adjusting to the resulting global warming or climate change
#''[[Suffering]]:'' having one's quality of life reduced as a result of the consequences

The '''H. John Heinz III College of Information Systems and Public Policy''' ('''Heinz College''' or '''HC''') at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]] is a private graduate college that consists of one of the nation's top-ranked [[public policy school]]s—the [[Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration]]-accredited School of Public Policy &amp; Management—and [[I-school|information schools]]—the School of Information Systems &amp; Management. It is named for the late [[United States Senator]] [[H. John Heinz III]] (1938-1991) from Pennsylvania. The Heinz College is also a member of the [[Institute for Information Infrastructure Protection]], one of 24 members of the iCaucus leadership of [[List of Information Schools#Members of the iSchools organization|iSchools]],&lt;ref name="iCaucus Members"&gt;{{cite web| title=iCaucus Members| work=iSchools| url=http://ischools.org/members/icaucus-members/| accessdate = 21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a founding member of the MetroLab Network, a national [[smart city]] initiative.&lt;ref name="MetroLab Network"&gt;{{cite web| title=MetroLab Network| url=http://metrolabnetwork.heinz.cmu.edu/| accessdate=15 September 2015| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150917051426/http://metrolabnetwork.heinz.cmu.edu/| archivedate=17 September 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Heinz College educational process integrates policy analysis, management, and information technology. Coursework emphasizes the applied and interdisciplinary fields of empirical methods and [[statistics]], [[economics]], [[information systems]] and [[technology]], [[operations research]], and [[organizational behavior]]. In addition to full-time, on campus programs in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Washington, DC]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Adelaide]], the Heinz College offers graduate-level programs to non-traditional students through part-time on-campus and distance programs, customized programs, and [[executive education]] programs for senior managers.

== History ==
[[File:John Heinz.jpg|thumb|325px|[[H. John Heinz III]], namesake of the Heinz College]]
[[Richard King Mellon]] and his wife Constance had long been interested in urban and social issues. In 1965, they sponsored a conference on urban problems, in which they began discussions with the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and [[Carnegie Mellon University]] to create a school focused on [[Public administration|public affairs]]. In 1967, Carnegie Mellon President [[H. Guyford Stever]], [[Richard Cyert|Richard M. Cyert]], Dean of the [[Tepper School of Business]], and [[Professor]]s [[William W. Cooper]] and Otto Davis met and formed a university-wide committee to discuss creating a school that would train leaders to address complex problems in [[United States|American]] [[Urban community|urban communities]]. Davis was asked to draft a proposal to create such a school and focused on applying the Tepper School of Business' pioneering quantitative and skill-based approach to management education as well as technology to public sector problems.

In 1968, William Cooper and Otto Davis presented the final proposal for the School of Urban and Public Affairs (SUPA) to the Richard King Mellon Foundation. The proposal found favor with R. K. Mellon and he became strongly committed to creating such a school. The R. K. Mellon Foundation sent a proposal to President Stever to finance it with an initial grant of $10 million, and on 1 November 1968, President Stever created the School of Urban and Public Affairs with William Cooper as the first dean. The school initially drew much of its faculty from the Tepper School of Business and was based in the Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall. Eventually, the school became independent of other colleges within the university and moved to its current location in historic [[Main Building, U.S. Bureau of Mines|Hamburg Hall]] when the facility was acquired by the university from the [[U.S. Bureau of Mines]]. Subsequent Deans include Otto Davis, [[Brian Berry]], Joel A. Tarr, [[Alfred Blumstein]], former Carnegie Mellon Provost Mark Kamlet, Linda C. Babcock, [[Jeffrey Hunker]], [[Mark Wessel]], and current dean [[Ramayya Krishnan]].

In 1992, [[Teresa Heinz]] donated a large sum of money to the school, which was then renamed as the H. John Heinz III School of Public Policy and Management in honor of Mrs. Heinz's late husband, Senator H. John Heinz III. Senator Heinz, heir to the [[H. J. Heinz Company]] fortune, had been killed when his small private plane crashed one year before.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web| title=History| work=Heinz College| url=http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/about-heinz/history/index.aspx| accessdate = 24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Heinz School received a grant from the [[Heinz Foundations]] that transformed the school into a college and formalized the School of Information Systems &amp; Management alongside the School of Public Policy &amp; Management under the college's administration. The official launch of the H. John Heinz III College of Information Systems and Public Policy was held on October 24, 2008 during Carnegie Mellon's [[Homecoming]] weekend and was led by Dean Krishnan, Teresa Heinz, and former [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Paul O'Neill (Secretary of the Treasury)|Paul O'Neill]].&lt;ref name="Oct. 24: Carnegie Mellon Dedicates New H.

== Facilities ==
[[Image:Main Building, U.S. Bureau of Mines.jpg|thumb|left|325px|[[Main Building, U.S. Bureau of Mines|Hamburg Hall]], home of the Heinz College]]
Heinz College is headquartered in Hamburg Hall, a building listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and designed by noted [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] architect [[Henry Hornbostel]]. Hamburg Hall is named for Lester A. Hamburg, an industrialist and philanthropist active in the [[History of the Jews in Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh Jewish Community]].&lt;ref name="NCJW Oral History Project"&gt;{{cite news| title=Pittsburgh and Beyond: The Experience of the Jewish Community| work=NCJW Oral History Project| url=http://images.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/i/image/image-idx?view=entry;cc=ncjw;entryid=x-ais196440.185"| accessdate = 16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Heinz College also has a [[Heinz College Australia|branch campus]] in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]], which offers master's degrees in Public Policy and Management and Information Technology. Heinz College also maintains a [[North Hollywood]] center in [[Los Angeles]] as part of the jointly administered master's degree program in Entertainment Industry Management, and a center in [[Washington, DC]] on [[Capitol Hill]] for students in the Public Policy and Management masters program.

Carnegie Mellon is in the process of renovating and expanding the Heinz College's Pittsburgh facilities through a four-phased process across [[Forbes Avenue]] from the 2013-announced Tepper Quadrangle. The ultimate plan for Hamburg Hall is to capture new space – approximately 20,000 square feet – by enclosing the courtyard between the rotunda, the East and West Wings, and the adjacent Elliott Dunlap Smith Hall with a soaring glass roof structure. This new space will include a large, multi‐purpose Classroom of the Future, lounges, meeting/study space, and a café. Phase I of renovations and expansion of Hamburg Hall was entirely financed by Heinz College and was completed in September 2013. Heinz College students immediately benefited from convenient access to the new student services and computing services suites. The construction of new career services interview rooms provides up‐to‐date facilities for on‐campus recruiters.&lt;ref name="CMU receives $10M to renovate, expand Heinz College"&gt;{{cite news| title=CMU receives $10M to renovate, expand Heinz College| work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/local/breaking/2013/12/11/CMU-receives-10M-to-renovate-expand-Heinz-College/stories/201312110152"| accessdate = 12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A December 2013 gift from [[The Heinz Endowments]] combined with gift commitments from other donors enabled the Heinz College to expedite the final architectural design of Phase II elements, finalize necessary construction planning, commence renovations and expansion, and complete a structure that will add additional value to the college. A new 150-seat auditorium in the courtyard between Hamburg Hall and Smith Hall was constructed, and both levels of the rotunda were transformed into student study and lounge spaces as well as a grand entrance and lobby area, and renamed as the Teresa Heinz Rotunda. The new auditorium allows the college to host high-profile speakers. Further, the west wing of Hamburg Hall now consists of forward-looking classrooms in the space that was vacated by the Engineering Research Accelerator when it moved to the newly constructed Scott Hall. An additional entrance from Forbes Avenue was also constructed.&lt;ref name="Heinz Endowments Gift"/&gt;&lt;ref name="12/03/2014 Town Hall Meeting"&gt;{{cite web| title=12/03/2014 Town Hall Meeting| work=Carnegie Mellon University| url=http://www.cmu.edu/cdfd/heinz-hamburg-hall/2014-12-03-town-hall-meeting/heinz-town-hall-combined.pdf| accessdate=14 February 2015| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214100825/http://www.cmu.edu/cdfd/heinz-hamburg-hall/2014-12-03-town-hall-meeting/heinz-town-hall-combined.pdf| archivedate=14 February 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Necessary Investment"&gt;{{cite web| title=Necessary Investment| work=Carnegie Mellon University| url=http://www.cmu.edu/piper/stories/2014/november/necessary-investment.html| accessdate = 25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heinz College - Hamburg Hall Addition"&gt;{{cite web| title=Heinz College - Hamburg Hall Addition| work=Carnegie Mellon University| url=http://www.cmu.edu/cdfd/heinz-hamburg-hall/index.html| accessdate=2 March 2016| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307065925/http://www.cmu.edu/cdfd/heinz-hamburg-hall/index.html| archivedate=7 March 2016| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Phase III the addition to Hamburg Hall, including a glass roof, end walls, café, and study space, will be constructed.  Fire protection and elevator improvements will also be addressed as well as the addition of new classrooms (including designated executive education rooms).  The addition of 20,000 square feet to Hamburg Hall will allow the Heinz College to continue to grow student enrollment.  This phase is planned for completion by 2017.

The final phase, Phase IV, will renovate third-floor faculty and PhD offices and meeting spaces.&lt;ref name="Necessary Investment"/&gt;

The new additions and renovations will be designed to achieve [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED Silver]] certification.&lt;ref name="CMU airs 10-year master plan"&gt;{{cite news| title=CMU airs 10-year master plan| work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/news/education/cmu-airs-10-year-master-plan-210704/| accessdate = 29 December 2012| first=Bill| last=Schackner| date=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heinz College"&gt;{{cite web| title=GBBN Architects: Carnegie Mellon University/Heinz College addition| work=web site| url=https://www.gbbn.com/work/carnegie-mellon-university-heinz-college-of-information-systems-and-public-policy/| accessdate = 22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Steam engine}}[[File:Savery-engine.jpg|upright|thumb|The 1698 ''Savery Steam Pump'' - the first commercially successful steam powered device, built by [[Thomas Savery]]]]

The first recorded rudimentary [[steam engine]] was the [[aeolipile]] described by [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron of Alexandria]] in 1st-century [[Roman Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;"turbine." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 18 July&lt;/ref&gt; Several steam-powered devices were later experimented with or proposed, such as [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]]'s [[steam jack]], a [[steam turbine]] in 16th-century [[Ottoman Egypt]], and [[Thomas Savery]]'s steam [[pump]] in 17th-century England. In 1712, [[Thomas Newcomen]]'s [[atmospheric engine]] became the first commercially successful engine using the principle of the piston and cylinder, which was the fundamental type steam engine used until the early 20th century. The steam engine was used to pump water out of coal mines

During the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[steam engine]]s started to replace water and wind power, and eventually became the dominant source of power in the late 19th century and remaining so into the early decades of the 20th century, when the more efficient steam turbine and the [[internal combustion engine]] resulted in the rapid replacement of the steam engines.  The [[steam turbine]] has become the most common method by which electrical power generators are driven.&lt;ref Name="Wiser"&gt;{{cite book |title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|last= Wiser |first= Wendell H. |year= 2000 |publisher= Birkhäuser |isbn= 978-0-387-98744-6 |page= 190 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=electrical+power+generators+steam+percent#v=onepage&amp;q=steam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations are being made into the practicalities of reviving the reciprocating steam engine as the basis for the new wave of [[advanced steam technology]].

This suggests that the conversion of steam pressure into mechanical movement was known in Roman Egypt in the 1st century. Heron also devised a machine that used air heated in an altar fire to displace a quantity of water from a closed vessel. The weight of the water was made to pull a hidden rope to operate temple doors.&lt;ref name="Dayton1925" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A rudimentary impact [[steam turbine]] was described in 1551 by [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]], a [[Islamic philosophy|philosopher]], [[Islamic astronomy|astronomer]] and [[Inventions in the Islamic world|engineer]] in 16th century [[Ottoman Egypt]], who described a method for rotating a [[Rotisserie|spit]] by means of a jet of steam playing on rotary vanes around the periphery of a wheel. A similar device for rotating a spit was also later described by [[John Wilkins]] in 1648.&lt;ref name=Hassan&gt;[http://www.history-science-technology.com/Notes/Notes%201.htm Taqi al-Din and the First Steam Turbine, 1551 A.D.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218171045/http://www.history-science-technology.com/Notes/Notes%201.htm |date=2008-02-18 }}, web page, accessed on line October 23, 2009; this web page refers to [[Ahmad Y Hassan]] (1976), ''Taqi al-Din and Arabic Mechanical Engineering'', pp. 34-5, Institute for the History of Arabic Science, [[University of Aleppo]].&lt;/ref&gt; These devices were then called "mills" but are now known as [[steam jack]]s. Another similar rudimentary steam turbine is shown by [[Giovanni Branca]], an [[Italy|Italian]] engineer, in 1629 for turning a cylindrical [[escapement]] device that alternately lifted and let fall a pair of pestles working in mortars.&lt;ref name=Giovanni&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.rochester.edu/steam/thurston/1878/Chapter1.html |title=University of Rochester, NY, '&amp;#39;The growth of the steam engine'&amp;#39; online history resource, chapter one |publisher=History.rochester.edu |accessdate=2012-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204034636/http://www.history.rochester.edu/steam/thurston/1878/Chapter1.html |archivedate=2012-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The steam flow of these early steam turbines, however, was not concentrated and most of its energy was dissipated in all directions. This would have led to a great waste of energy and so they were never seriously considered for industrial use.

In 1605 French mathematician [[Florence Rivault]] in his treatise on artillery wrote on his discovery that water, if confined in a bombshell and heated, would explode the shells.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Henry Thurston, ''A history of the growth of the steam-engine'', D. Appleton and company, 1903, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uc8WAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=%22florence+rivault%22&amp;ei=rsx5S43-JI6ezATU3OnvCA&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22florence%20rivault%22&amp;f=false Google Print, p.15-16] (public domain)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1643 [[Evangelista Torricelli]] conducted experiments on suction lift water pumps to test their limits, which was about 32 feet (Atmospheric pressure is 32.9 feet or 10.03 meters. Vapor pressure of water lowers theoretical lift height.). He devised an experiment using a tube filled with mercury and inverted  in a bowl of mercury (a [[barometer]]) and observed an empty space above the column of mercury, which he theorized contained nothing, that is, a vacuum.&lt;ref name="Johnson_2008"&gt;{{cite book

Influenced by Torricelli, [[Otto von Guericke]] invented a vacuum pump by modifying an [[air pump]] used for pressurizing an [[air gun]].  Guericke put on a demonstration in 1654 in Magdeburg, Germany, where he was mayor.  Two copper hemispheres were fitted together and air was pumped out.  Weights strapped to the hemispheres could not pull them apart until the air valve was opened.  The experiment was repeated in 1656 using two teams of 8 horses each, which could not separate the [[Magdeburg hemispheres]].&lt;ref name="Johnson_2008"/&gt;

[[Gaspar Schott]] was the first to describe the hemisphere experiment in his ''Mechanica Hydraulico-Pneumatica'' (1657).&lt;ref name="Johnson_2008"/&gt;

After reading Schott’s book, [[Robert Boyle]] built an improved vacuum pump and conducted related experiments.&lt;ref name="Johnson_2008"/&gt;

[[Denis Papin]] became interested in using a vacuum to generate motive power while working with [[Christiaan Huygens]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in Paris in 1663.  Papin worked for Robert Boyle from 1676 to 1679, publishing an account of his work in ''Continuation of New Experiments'' (1680) and gave a presentation to Royal Society in 1689.  From 1690 on Papin began experimenting with a piston to produce power with steam, building model steam engines.  He experimented with atmospheric and pressure steam engines, publishing his results in 1707.&lt;ref name="Johnson_2008"/&gt;

In 1663 [[Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester]] published a book of 100 inventions which described a method for raising water between floors employing a similar principle to that of a [[coffee percolator]]. His system was the first to separate the boiler (a heated cannon barrel) from the pumping action. Water was admitted into a reinforced barrel from a cistern, and then a valve was opened to admit steam from a separate boiler. The pressure built over the top of the water, driving it up a pipe.&lt;ref&gt;Tredgold, pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt; He installed his steam-powered device on the wall of the Great Tower at [[Raglan Castle]] to supply water through the tower. The grooves in the wall where the engine was installed were still to be seen in the 19th century. However, no one was prepared to risk money for such a revolutionary concept, and without backers the machine remained undeveloped.&lt;ref name="Johnson_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Samuel Morland]], a mathematician and inventor who worked on pumps, left notes at the Vauxhall Ordinance Office on a steam pump design that [[Thomas Savery]] read.  In 1698 Savery built a steam pump called “The Miner’s Friend.” It employed both vacuum and pressure.  These were used for low horsepower service for a number of years.&lt;ref name="Johnson_2008"/&gt;

[[Thomas Newcomen]] was a merchant who dealt in cast iron goods.  Newcomen’s engine was based on the piston and cylinder design proposed by Papin.  In Newcomen's engine steam was condensed by water sprayed inside the cylinder, causing atmospheric pressure to move the piston.  Newcomen’s first engine installed for pumping in a mine in 1712 at Dudley Castle in Staffordshire.&lt;ref name="Johnson_2008"/&gt;

===Cylinders===

[[File:Papinengine.jpg|100px|thumb|right|Denis Papin's design for a piston-and-cylinder engine, 1680.]]
[[Denis Papin]] (22 August 1647 – c. 1712) was a French physicist, mathematician and inventor, best known for his pioneering invention of the [[steam digester]], the forerunner of the pressure cooker. In the mid-1670s Papin collaborated with the Dutch physicist [[Christiaan Huygens]] on an engine which drove out the air from a cylinder by exploding [[gunpowder]] inside it. Realising the incompleteness of the vacuum produced by this means and on moving to England in 1680, Papin devised a version of the same cylinder that obtained a more complete vacuum from boiling water and then allowing the steam to condense; in this way he was able to raise weights by attaching the end of the piston to a rope passing over a pulley. As a demonstration model the system worked, but in order to repeat the process the whole apparatus had to be dismantled and reassembled. Papin quickly saw that to make an automatic cycle the steam would have to be generated separately in a boiler; however, he did not take the project further. Papin also designed a paddle boat driven by a jet playing on a mill-wheel in a combination of Taqi al Din and Savery's conceptions and he is also credited with a number of significant devices such as the [[safety valve]]. Papin's years of research into the problems of harnessing steam was to play a key part in the development of the first successful industrial engines that soon followed his death.

===Savery steam pump===

{{Main article|Thomas Savery}}
The first steam engine to be applied industrially was the "fire-engine" or "Miner's Friend", designed by [[Thomas Savery]] in 1698. This was a pistonless steam pump, similar to the one developed by Worcester. Savery made two key contributions that greatly improved the practicality of the design. First, in order to allow the water supply to be placed below the engine, he used condensed steam to produce a partial vacuum in the pumping reservoir  (the barrel in Worcester's example), and using that to pull the water upward. Secondly, in order to rapidly cool the steam to produce the vacuum, he ran cold water over the reservoir.

Operation required several valves; when the reservoir was empty at the start of a cycle a valve was opened to admit steam. The valve was closed to seal the reservoir and the cooling water valve turned on to condense the steam and create a partial vacuum. A supply valve was opened, pulling water upward into the reservoir, and the typical engine could pull water up to 20 feet.&lt;ref name="Tredgold, pg. 6"&gt;Tredgold, pg. 6&lt;/ref&gt; This was closed and the steam valve reopened, building pressure over the water and pumping it upward, as in the Worcester design. The cycle essentially doubled the distance that water could be pumped for any given pressure of steam, and production examples raised water about 40 feet.&lt;ref name="Tredgold, pg. 6"/&gt;

Savery's engine solved a problem that had only recently become a serious one; raising water out of the mines in southern England as they reached greater depths.  Savery's engine was somewhat less efficient than Newcomen's, but this was compensated for by the fact that the separate pump used by the Newcomen engine was inefficient, giving the two engines roughly the same efficiency of 6 million foot pounds per bushel of coal (less than 1%).&lt;ref name="Landes"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Nor was the Savery engine very safe because part of its cycle required steam under pressure supplied by a boiler, and given the technology of the period the [[pressure vessel]] could not be made strong enough and so was prone to explosion.&lt;ref name="Rolt-Allen"/&gt; The explosion of one of his pumps at Broad Waters (near [[Wednesbury]]), about 1705, probably marks the end of attempts to exploit his invention.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite journal |author=P.

It was [[Thomas Newcomen]] with his "[[Newcomen steam engine|atmospheric-engine]]" of 1712 who can be said to have brought together most of the essential elements established by Papin in order to develop the first practical steam engine for which there could be a commercial demand. This took the shape of a reciprocating beam engine installed at surface level driving a succession of pumps at one end of the beam. The engine, attached by chains from other end of the beam, worked on the atmospheric, or vacuum principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt6r29q3kz/?order=1&amp;brand=oac |title=Paxton Engineering Division Report (2 of 3) |publisher=Content.cdlib.org |date=2009-10-20 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newcomen's design used some elements of earlier concepts. Like the Savery design, Newcomen's engine used steam, cooled with water, to create a vacuum. Unlike Savery's pump, however, Newcomen used the vacuum to pull on a piston instead of pulling on water directly. The upper end of the cylinder was open to the atmospheric pressure, and when the vacuum formed, the atmospheric pressure above the piston pushed it down into the cylinder. The piston was lubricated and sealed by a trickle of water from the same cistern that supplied the cooling water. Further, to improve the cooling effect, he sprayed water directly into the cylinder. 
[[File:Newcomen atmospheric engine animation.gif|right|Animation of a Newcomen atmospheric engine in action]]

The piston was attached by a chain to a large pivoted beam. When the piston pulled the beam, the other side of the beam was pulled upward. This end was attached to a rod that pulled on a series of conventional pump handles in the mine. At the end of this power stroke, the steam valve was reopened, and the weight of the pump rods pulled the beam down, lifting the piston and drawing steam into the cylinder again.

Using the piston and beam allowed the Newcomen engine to power pumps at different levels throughout the mine, as well as eliminating the need for any high-pressure steam. The entire system was isolated to a single building on the surface. Although inefficient and extremely heavy on coal (compared to later engines), these engines raised far greater volumes of water and from greater depths than had previously been possible.&lt;ref name="Rolt-Allen"&gt;L. T. C. Rolt and J. S. Allen, ''The Steam Engine of Thomas Newcomen'' (Landmark Publishing, Ashbourne 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Over 100 Newcomen engines were installed around England by 1735, and it is estimated that as many as 2,000 were in operation by 1800 (including Watt versions).

[[John Smeaton]] made numerous improvements to the Newcomen engine, notably the seals, and by improving these was able to almost triple their efficiency. He also preferred to use wheels instead of beams for transferring power from the cylinder, which made his engines more compact. Smeaton was the first to develop a rigorous theory of steam engine design of operation. He worked backward from the intended role to calculate the amount of [[power (physics)|power]] that would be needed for the task, the size and speed of a cylinder that would provide it, the size of boiler needed to feed it, and the amount of fuel it would consume. These were developed empirically after studying dozens of Newcomen engines in Cornwall and Newcastle, and building an experimental engine of his own at his home in [[Austhorpe]] in 1770. By the time the Watt engine was introduced only a few years later, Smeaton had built dozens of ever-larger engines into the 100&amp;nbsp;hp range.&lt;ref&gt;Tredgold, pg. 21-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Watt's separate condenser===
[[File:Watt steam pumping engine.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Early Watt pumping engine.]]

While working at the [[University of Glasgow]] as an instrument maker and repairman in 1759, [[James Watt]] was introduced to the power of steam by Professor [[John Robison (physicist)|John Robison]]. Fascinated, Watt took to reading everything he could on the subject, and independently developed the concept of [[latent heat]], only recently published by [[Joseph Black]] at the same university. When Watt learned that the University owned a small working model of a Newcomen engine, he pressed to have it returned from [[London]] where it was being unsuccessfully repaired. Watt repaired the machine, but found it was barely functional even when fully repaired.

After working with the design, Watt concluded that 80% of the steam used by the engine was wasted. Instead of providing motive force, it was instead being used to heat the cylinder. In the Newcomen design, every power stroke was started with a spray of cold water, which not only condensed the steam, but also cooled the walls of the cylinder. This heat had to be replaced before the cylinder would accept steam again. In the Newcomen engine the heat was supplied only by the steam, so when the steam valve was opened again the vast majority condensed on the cold walls as soon as it was admitted to the cylinder. It took a considerable amount of time and steam before the cylinder warmed back up and the steam started to fill it up.

Watt solved the problem of the water spray by removing the cold water to a different cylinder, placed beside the power cylinder. Once the induction stroke was complete a valve was opened between the two, and any steam that entered the cylinder would condense inside this cold cylinder. This would create a vacuum that would pull more of the steam into the cylinder, and  so on until the steam was mostly condensed. The valve was then closed, and operation of the main cylinder continued as it would on a conventional Newcomen engine. As the power cylinder remained at operational temperature throughout, the system was ready for another stroke as soon as the piston was pulled back to the top. Maintaining the temperature was a jacket around the cylinder where steam was admitted. Watt produced a working model in 1765.

Convinced that this was a great advance, Watt entered into partnerships to provide [[venture capital]] while he worked on the design. Not content with this single improvement, Watt worked tirelessly on a series of other improvements to practically every part of the engine.  Watt further improved the system by adding a small vacuum pump to pull the steam out of the cylinder into the condenser, further improving cycle times. A more radical change from the Newcomen design was closing off the top of the cylinder and introducing low-pressure steam above the piston. Now the power was not due to the difference of atmospheric pressure and the vacuum, but the pressure of the steam and the vacuum, a somewhat higher value. On the upward return stroke, the steam on top was transferred through a pipe to the underside of the piston ready to be condensed for the downward stroke. Sealing of the piston on a [[Newcomen engine]] had been achieved by maintaining a small quantity of water on its upper side. This was no longer possible in Watt's engine due to the presence of the steam. Watt spent considerable effort to find a seal that worked, eventually obtained by using a mixture of tallow and oil. The piston rod also passed through a [[Gland (engineering)|gland]] on the top cylinder cover sealed in a similar way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/on-line/energyhall/page19.asp |title=Energy Hall &amp;#124; See 'Old Bess' at work |publisher=Science Museum |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The piston sealing problem was due to having no way to produce a sufficiently round cylinder.  Watt tried having cylinders bored from cast iron, but they were too out of round.  Watt was forced to use a hammered iron cylinder.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt; The following quotation is from Roe (1916):

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When [John] [[John Smeaton|Smeaton]] first saw the engine he reported to the Society of Engineers that 'neither the tools nor the workmen existed who could manufacture such a complex machine with sufficient precision' "&lt;ref name="Roe1916"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Watt finally considered the design good enough to release in 1774, and the [[Watt engine]] was released to the market. As portions of the design could be easily fitted to existing Newcomen engines, there was no need to build an entirely new engine at the mines. Instead, Watt and his business partner [[Matthew Boulton]] licensed the improvements to engine operators, charging them a portion of the money they would save in reduced fuel costs. The design was wildly successful, and the [[Boulton and Watt]] company was formed to license the design and help new manufacturers build the engines. The two would later open the [[Soho Foundry]] to produce engines of their own.

In 1774 [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] invented a boring machine with the shaft holding the boring tool supported on both ends, extending through the cylinder, unlike the then used cantilevered borers.  With this machine he was able to successfully bore the cylinder for [[Boulton and Watt]]'s first commercial engine in 1776.&lt;ref name="Roe1916"&gt;{{citation | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage | lccn = 16011753}}.

Watt never ceased improving his designs. This further improved the operating cycle speed, introduced governors, automatic valves, double-acting pistons, a variety of rotary power takeoffs and many other improvements.  Watt's technology enabled the widespread commercial use of stationary steam engines.&lt;ref&gt;Ogg, David. (1965), ''Europe of the Ancien Regime: 1715-1783'' Fontana History of Europe, (pp. 117 &amp; 283)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Humphrey Gainsborough]] produced a model [[Condensation|condensing]] steam engine in the 1760s, which he showed to [[Richard Lovell Edgeworth]], a member of the [[Lunar Society]]. Gainsborough believed that Watt had used his ideas for the invention;&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, David (2004): ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; however James Watt was not a member of the Lunar Society at this period and his many accounts explaining the succession of thought processes leading to the final design would tend to belie this story.

Power was still limited by the low pressure, the displacement of the cylinder, combustion and evaporation rates and condenser capacity. Maximum theoretical efficiency was limited by the relatively low temperature differential on either side of the piston; this meant that for a Watt engine to provide a usable amount of power, the first production engines had to be very large, and were thus expensive to build and install.

===Watt double-acting and rotative engines===
{{details|Rotative beam engine}}

Watt developed a double-acting engine in which steam drove the piston in both directions, thereby increasing the engine speed and efficiency.  The double-acting principle also significantly increased the output of a given physical sized engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Boulton &amp; Watt]] developed the reciprocating engine into the [[rotative beam engine|rotative type]]. Unlike the Newcomen engine, the Watt engine could operate smoothly enough to be connected to a drive shaft – via [[sun and planet gear]]s – to provide rotary power along with double-acting condensing cylinders. The earliest example was built as a demonstrator and was installed in Boulton's factory to work machines for lapping (polishing) buttons or similar. For this reason it was always known as the ''[[Lap Engine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/motive_power/1861-46.aspx |title=The "Lap engine" at Science Museum, London (picture) |publisher=Sciencemuseum.org.uk |date=2007-01-16 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hulse, David K., The development of rotary motion by steam power (TEE Publishing Ltd., Leamington, UK., 2001) {{ISBN|1-85761-119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In early steam engines the piston is usually connected by a rod to a balanced beam, rather than directly to a flywheel, and these engines are therefore known as [[beam engine]]s.

Early steam engines did not provide constant enough speed for critical operations such as cotton spinning. To control speed the engine was used to pump water for a water wheel, which powered the machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==High-pressure engines==

As the 18th century advanced, the call was for higher pressures; this was strongly resisted by Watt who used the monopoly his patent gave him to prevent others from building high-pressure engines and using them in vehicles. He mistrusted the boiler technology of the day, the way they were constructed and the strength of the materials used.

The important advantages of high-pressure engines were: 
#They could be made much smaller than previously for a given power output. There was thus the potential for steam engines to be developed that were small and powerful enough to propel themselves and other objects. As a result, steam power for transportation now became a practicality in the form of ships and land vehicles, which revolutionised cargo businesses, travel, military strategy, and essentially every aspect of society.  
# Because of their smaller size, they were much less expensive.  
# They did not require the significant quantities of condenser cooling water needed by atmospheric engines.  
# They could be designed to run at higher speeds, making them more suitable for powering machinery.

The disadvantages were: 
# In the low-pressure range they were less efficient than condensing engines, especially if steam was not used expansively.  
# They were more susceptible to boiler explosions.

The main difference between how high-pressure and low-pressure steam engines work is the source of the force that moves the piston. In the engines of Newcomen and Watt, it is the condensation of the steam that creates most of the pressure difference, causing atmospheric pressure (Newcomen) and low-pressure steam, seldom more than 7 psi boiler pressure,&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/cu31924004249532#page/n45/mode/2up p.21&lt;/ref&gt; plus condenser vacuum&lt;ref&gt;"The Steam Engine a brief history of the reciprocating engine, R.J.Law, Science Museum, Her Majesty's Stationery Office London, {{ISBN|0 11 290016 X}}, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; (Watt), to move the piston. In a high-pressure engine, most of the pressure difference is provided by the high-pressure steam from the boiler; the low-pressure side of the piston may be at atmospheric pressure or connected to the condenser pressure. Newcomen's [[indicator diagram]], almost all below the atmospheric line, would see a revival nearly 200 years later with the low pressure cylinder of triple expansion engines contributing about 20% of the engine power, again almost completely below the atmospheric line.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Special:MemberUsers?file=images%2F6%2F69%2FEr19010125.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known advocate of "strong steam" was [[Jacob Leupold]] in his scheme for an engine that appeared in encyclopaedic works from around 1725. Various projects for steam propelled boats and vehicles also appeared throughout the century one of the most promising being [[Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot]]'s who demonstrated his "fardier" (steam wagon), in 1769. Whilst the working pressure used for this vehicle is unknown, the small size of the boiler gave insufficient steam production rate to allow the fardier to advance more than a few hundred metres at a time before having to stop to raise steam. Other projects and models were proposed, but as with [[William Murdoch]]'s model of 1784, many were blocked by Boulton and Watt.

This did not apply in the US, and in 1788 a steamboat built by [[John Fitch (inventor)|John Fitch]] operated in regular commercial service along the [[Delaware River]] between Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania, and Burlington, New Jersey, carrying as many as 30 passengers. This boat could typically make 7 to 8 miles per hour, and traveled more than {{convert|2000|mi|km|-2}} during its short length of service. The Fitch steamboat was not a commercial success, as this route was adequately covered by relatively good wagon roads. In 1802 [[William Symington]] built a practical steamboat, and in 1807 [[Robert Fulton]] used a Watt steam engine to power the first commercially successful [[steamboat]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

[[Oliver Evans]] in his turn was in favour of "strong steam" which he applied to boat engines and to stationary uses. He was a pioneer of cylindrical boilers; however Evans' boilers did suffer several serious boiler explosions, which tended to lend weight to Watt's qualms. He founded the [[Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company]] in 1811 in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The company introduced high-pressure steam engines to the riverboat trade in the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi watershed]].

The first high-pressure steam engine was invented in 1800 by [[Richard Trevithick]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.engineering-timelines.com/who/Trevithick_R/trevithickRichard4.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of raising steam under pressure (from a [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] standpoint) is that it attains a higher temperature. Thus, any engine using high-pressure steam operates at a higher temperature and pressure differential than is possible with a low-pressure vacuum engine. The high-pressure engine thus became the basis for most further development of reciprocating steam technology. Even so, around the year 1800, "high pressure" amounted to what today would be considered very low pressure, i.e. 40-50 psi (276-345 kPa), the point being that the high-pressure engine in question was non-condensing, driven solely by the expansive power of the steam, and once that steam had performed work it was usually exhausted at higher-than-atmospheric pressure. The blast of the exhausting steam into the chimney could be exploited to create induced draught through the fire grate and thus increase the rate of burning, hence creating more heat in a smaller furnace, at the expense of creating back pressure on the exhaust side of the piston.

On 21 February 1804, at the [[Penydarren]] ironworks at [[Merthyr Tydfil]] in South Wales, the first self-propelled railway steam engine or steam locomotive, built by [[Richard Trevithick]], was demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Robert: "Timothy Hackworth and the Locomotive"; the Book guild Ltd, Lewes, U.K. (2000) (reprint of 1923 ed.) pp.18-21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cornish engine and compounding===
{{Main article|Cornish steam engine|Compound engine}}
[[File:Cornish Figuier.JPG|thumb|left|Trevithick pumping engine (Cornish system).]]

Around 1811 [[Richard Trevithick]] was required to update a Watt pumping engine in order to adapt it to one of his new large cylindrical [[Cornish boiler]]s. When Trevithick left for South America in 1816, his improvements were continued by [[William Sims (engineer)|William Sims]]. In a parallel, [[Arthur Woolf]] developed a [[compound engine]] with two cylinders, so that steam expanded in a high-pressure cylinder before being released into a low-pressure one. Efficiency was further improved by [[Samuel Groase]], who insulated the boiler, engine, and pipes.&lt;ref name="Nuvolari &amp; Verspagen, 2007" &gt;{{cite journal

Steam pressure above the piston was increased eventually reaching {{convert|40|psi|MPa|2|abbr=on|lk=on}} or even {{convert|50|psi|MPa|2|abbr=on|lk=on}} and now provided much of the power for the downward stroke; at the same time condensing was improved. This considerably raised efficiency and further pumping engines on the Cornish system (often known as [[Cornish engine]]s) continued to be built new throughout the 19th century. Older [[Watt engine]]s were updated to conform.

The take-up of these Cornish improvements was slow in textile manufacturing areas where coal was cheap, due to the higher capital cost of the engines and the greater wear that they suffered. The change only began in the 1830s, usually by compounding through adding another (high-pressure) cylinder.&lt;ref name="Nuvolari &amp; Verspagen, 2009" &gt;{{cite journal

Another limitation of early steam engines was speed variability, which made them unsuitable for many textile applications, especially spinning.  In order to obtain steady speeds, early steam powered textile mills used the steam engine to pump water to a water wheel, which drove the machinery.&lt;ref name="Thomson 2009"&gt;{{cite book

Many of these engines were supplied worldwide and gave reliable and efficient service over a great many years with greatly reduced coal consumption. Some of them were very large and the type continued to be built right down to the 1890s.

==Corliss engine==
{{Main article|Corliss steam engine}}
[[File:Corliss valvegear, Gordon's improved (New Catechism of the Steam Engine, 1904).jpg|thumb|right|"Gordon's improved Corliss valvegear", detailed view.  The wrist-plate is the central plate from which rods radiate to each of the 4 valves.]]
The [[Corliss steam engine]] (patented 1849) was called the greatest improvement since James Watt.&lt;ref name="Thomson 2009 p83"&gt;Thomson, p. 83-85.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Corliss steam engine|Corliss engine]] had greatly improved speed control and better efficiency, making it suitable to all sorts of industrial applications, including spinning.

Corliss used separate ports for steam supply and exhaust, which prevented the exhaust from cooling the passage used by the hot steam.  Corliss also used partially rotating valves that provided quick action, helping to reduce pressure losses.  The valves themselves were also a source of reduced friction, especially compared to the slide valve, which typically used 10% of an engine's power.&lt;ref name="Hunter and Bryant"/&gt;

Corliss used automatic variable cut off. The valve gear controlled engine speed by using the governor to vary the timing of the cut off.  This was partly responsible for the efficiency improvement in addition to the better speed control.

The Porter-Allen engine, introduced in 1862, used an advanced valve gear mechanism developed for Porter by Allen, a mechanic of exceptional ability, and was at first generally known as the Allen engine.

The high speed engine ran at piston speeds from three to five times the speed of ordinary engines.  It also had low speed variability. The high speed engine was  widely used in sawmills to power circular saws.  Later it was used for electrical generation.

The engine had several advantages. It could, in some cases, be directly coupled.  If gears or belts and drums were used, they could be much smaller sizes.  The engine itself was also small for the amount of power it developed.&lt;ref name="Hunter and Bryant"/&gt;

Porter greatly improved the fly-ball governor by reducing the rotating weight and adding a weight around the shaft.  This significantly improved speed control. Porter's governor became the leading type by 1880.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The efficiency of the Porter-Allen engine was good, but not equal to the Corliss engine.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The '''Icelandic Elf School''', known as ''Álfaskólinn'' in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], is a school in Iceland that teaches students and visitors about Icelandic folklore.

The school teaches about the [[hidden people]] and the 13 different kinds of [[elves]] that the school believes inhabit the country of Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=VIDEO: Belief in Elves Strong in Iceland | date=2008-12-11 | publisher= | url =http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/12/081211-elves-video-ap.html | work =National Geographic News | pages = | accessdate = 2009-05-30 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the school's headmaster, hidden people "are just the same size and look exactly like human beings, the only difference is that they are invisible to most of us. Elves, on the other hand, aren’t entirely human, they’re humanoid, starting at around eight centimetres."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Marc | last=Vincenz | coauthors= | authorlink= | title=To Be or Not to Be; Álfar, Elves, Huldufólk, Fairies and Dwarves: Are They Really All the Same Thing? | date=2009-05-27 | publisher= | url=http://www.grapevine.is/Features/ReadArticle/Article-To-Be-or-Not-to-Be | work=The Reykjavík Grapevine | pages= | accessdate=2009-06-14 | language= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404114957/http://www.grapevine.is/Features/ReadArticle/Article-To-Be-or-Not-to-Be | archivedate=2010-04-04 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claims there are [[LGBT|gay and lesbian]] elves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fucking-different.de/flash/dl/fuckingDifferent_dialogueList.zip | title = Schwule Elfen | accessdate = 2010-12-11 | last = Frömming | first = Undine | year = 2005 | work = Fucking Different | publisher = Kristian Petersen Filmproduktion | language = German, English | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719025638/http://www.fucking-different.de/flash/dl/fuckingDifferent_dialogueList.zip | archivedate = 2011-07-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The school is located in [[Reykjavík]], the country's largest city.

The school is headed by Magnús Skarphéðinsson.  Magnús has a full curriculum, and certificate programs for visitors that can be earned in as little as half a day. However, the school also publishes texts on hidden people, partly for its own use in the classroom. There is also ongoing research on the elves and hidden people of Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Douglas | last=McArthur | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Elfschool tries to make a believer out of everyone | date=1996-03-13 | publisher= | url = | work =The Globe and Mail (Canada) | pages =  | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also collects stories about trolls, fairies, dwarves, and gnomes, but says that "nearly 70 percent of our stories are about hidden people, because they are most seen here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Barbara | last=Gruber | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Iceland: Searching For Elves And Hidden People | date=June 2007 | publisher= | url =http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,2786922,00.html | work =Deutsche Welle | pages = | accessdate = 2009-10-31 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These stories have been collected for the purpose of preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dreams, Darkness and Hidden Spheres : Exploring the Anthropology of the Night in Icelandic Society |journal=Paideuma: Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde|year=2005|first=Adriënne|last=Heijnen|coauthors=|volume=51|issue=|pages=203|id= |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=17302753|format=|accessdate=2010-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnús organizes five hour long educational excursions for visitors, and finishes the tour with coffee and pancakes at the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Ferðast um huliðsheima | date=1997-06-15 | publisher= | url =http://www.ismennt.is/vefir/ari/alfar/afraedi/alfaskoli1.htm | work =Morgunblaðið | pages = | accessdate = 2009-05-30 | language = Icelandic }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite never advertising his school, Magnus typically gets 5–10 people per excursion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Alfar og huldufólk flutt út | date=1997-07-09 | publisher= | url =http://www.timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?issId=246906&amp;pageId=3349405&amp;lang=is&amp;q=Álfaskólinn | work =Alþýðublaðið | pages =1 | accessdate = 2009-06-07 | language = Icelandic }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since opening in 1991, over 9,000 people, most of them foreigners, have attended the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Carl | last=Honoré | coauthors= | authorlink= | title=The Hidden Beings Of Iceland | date=2005-07-01 | publisher= | url=http://www.americanwaymag.com/icelandic-elf-school-reykjavik-soccer-little-house-on-the-prairie | work=American Way | pages= | accessdate=2009-06-14 | language= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220181307/http://www.americanwaymag.com/icelandic-elf-school-reykjavik-soccer-little-house-on-the-prairie | archivedate=2009-02-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Álfaskólinn also provides "[[Aura reading|aura readings]]" and "[[Past life regression|past-life explorations]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rakoff | first = David | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Fraud: Essays | publisher = Broadway Books | year = 2002 | location = New York, NY | pages = 85 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gjnfDpm6ubIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=fraud&amp;pg=PT98#v=onepage&amp;q=elf%20school&amp;f=false | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7679-0631-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of the "level of belief in elves" in Iceland is somewhat of a cultural topos, with survey results published in 1975, 1995, 1998, 2006. Interpretations of the survey results vary.
Based on the 2006 figures, Magnús claims that while only 26% of Icelanders believe in elves (summing the responses 'certain' and 'probable'), 80% "do take notice" (including the replies 'possible' and 'unlikely').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Gillian | last=Johnson | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Looking for the hidden folk | date=1996-07-26 | publisher= | url =http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?issId=164796&amp;pageId=2240420&amp;lang=en | work =Lögberg-Heimskringla | pages =3 | accessdate = 2009-06-14 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Mathematics''' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: {{lang|hy|Մաթեմատիկայի Ինստիտուտ}}) is owned and operated by the [[Armenian Academy of Sciences]], located in [[Yerevan]].

==History==
The '''Institute of Mathematics of National Academy of Sciences of Armenia''' originated as the Section for Mathematics and Mechanics, created within the newly formed [[Armenian Academy of Sciences]] in 1944.  The section later developed into an Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics of Armenian Academy of Sciences, whose first Director was academician [[Artashes Shahinian]], known for his results in [[complex analysis]]. The Institute of Mathematics of Armenian Academy of Sciences separated from the latter Institute in 1971. The bearer of the office of the Director of Institute has been academician [[Mkhitar Djrbashian]] (1971-1989, 1989-1994 Honorary Director).

The academicians [[Sergey Mergelyan]], [[Norair Arakelian]], [[Alexandr Talalyan]], [[Raphayel Alexandrian]], [[Rouben V. Ambartzumian]] and [[Anry Nersesyan]] also have greatly influenced the formation of the scientific profile of the Institute and largely contributed to mathematics in general. In particular [[Rouben V. Ambartzumian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.3103/S1068362313010019?no-access=true |doi= 10.3103/S1068362313010019 |volume=48 |title= Academician R. V. Ambartzumian |journal= Journal of Contemporary Mathematical Analysis |pages= 1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is famous for his work in [[Stochastic geometry|Stochastic Geometry]] and [[Integral geometry|Integral Geometry]], where he created a new branch called Combinatorial Integral Geometry.&lt;ref&gt;1982 – R.V. Ambartzumian. ''Combinatorial Integral Geometry with Applications to Mathematical [[Stereology]]'', John Wiley, Chichester, NY&lt;/ref&gt; He has provided solutions to a number of classical problems in particular the solution to the Buffon Sylvester problem as well as the [[Hilbert's fourth problem#cite note-5|Hilbert's fourth problem]] in dimensions 2&lt;ref&gt;R. V. Ambartzumian. "A note on pseudo-metrics on the plane". ''Zeitschrift für Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie und Verwandte Gebiete''. 1976, Volume 37, Issue 2, pp. 145-155&lt;/ref&gt; and 3.&lt;ref&gt;R. V. Ambartzumian. "Remarks on Combinatorics of Planes in Euclidean Three Dimensions". ''SOP Transactions on Applied Mathematics''. Volume 1, Number 2, pp. 29-43. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years, the investigations carried out in the Institute concentrated on [[complex analysis|Function Theory]]. Gradually the sphere of investigations expanded and now includes [[differential equations|Differential]] and [[integral equation|Integral]] Equations, [[Functional Analysis]], [[Probability Theory]] and [[Mathematical Statistics]].

==Journals==
The institute has a journal, ''[[Izvestia NAS RA Matematika]]''. The founder and the first Editor in Chief (1971–1990) of the journal was [[Mkhitar Djrbashian]]; under [[Rouben V. Ambartzumian]] Editor in Chief (1990 - 2010) the journal obtained international recognition and obtained an English version, ''[[Journal of Contemporary Mathematical Analysis]]'', published initially by Allerton Press, Inc. New York and later by [[Springer Science+Business Media]]. Journal covers a host of topics including: [[real analysis]] and [[complex analysis]]; [[approximation theory]], [[boundary value problem]]s; [[integral geometry]] and [[stochastic geometry]]; [[differential equations]]; [[probability]] and [[statistics]]; [[integral equations]]; [[algebra]].

==Directors, faculty and members==
At present the Institute has about 30 main researchers as well as a number of associate researchers from [[Yerevan State University]].

[[Norair Arakelian]] in 1970 (Nice) and [[Mkhitar Djrbashian]], [[Rouben V. Ambartzumian]] in 1974 (Vancouver) were invited speakers at the 
[[International Congresses of Mathematicians]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8368">The '''International Greek New Testament Project''' (IGNTP) began in 1926 as a cooperative enterprise between [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Germany|German]] scholars to establish a new [[Textual criticism|critical edition]] of the [[New Testament]]. Early results of the work were critical apparatus of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and the [[Gospel of Mark]] produced by S. C. E. Legg in the 1930s. Wartime difficulties prevented cooperation during most of the 1940s, but the project was resurrected in 1949 as a cooperative endeavour between British and [[North American]] scholars. In the meantime research was taken up by [[Kurt Aland]] and the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research|Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung]] in [[Münster]].  British and North American cooperation resulted in the publication of a critical apparatus for the [[Gospel of Luke]] in the 1980s.

Current research focuses on the [[Gospel of John]], and the surviving majuscule manuscripts have been published in print and electronic form. The present committee comprises scholars from Europe and North America.

[[File:St John the Baptist, Great East Window of York Minster, by John Thornton.jpg|thumb|right|Thornton's depiction of [[St John the Baptist]], from the Great East Window of [[York Minster]], showing his characteristic treatment of faces]]
'''John Thornton''' of [[Coventry]] ([[floruit|fl]]. 1405-1433) was a master [[glazier]] and [[stained glass]] artist active in England during the 15th century. The output of his workshop includes some of the finest English medieval glass.

==Biography==
The first certain record of Thornton, apart from a possible 1371 reference in Coventry, is his 1405 contract with the Dean of [[York Minster]] to glaze the choir east window.&lt;ref name=sge180&gt;Marks, R. ''Stained Glass in England during the Middle Ages'', Routledge, 1993, p.180&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Archbishop of York]] at the time was [[Richard le Scrope]], a former [[Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry]], and the window was funded by [[Walter Skirlaw]], also previously Bishop of Coventry, so it seems possible both men would have recommended Thornton based on their knowledge of his work in his home town.

Thornton was made a [[Freedom of the City|freeman]] of York in 1410, but was known to be back living in the St John's Bridges area of Coventry (now known as Burges&lt;ref&gt;http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=16006&lt;/ref&gt;) by 1413. He appears again in 1433, when he received further payment from the dean and chapter of York, and was recorded as holding property there.&lt;ref name="sge180"/&gt;

It has been suggested, though without any strong evidence, that Thornton was the son of a "John Coventre", a glazier in the royal glass-painting workshops at Westminster in 1351 and 1352, who later assisted in setting up windows at [[Windsor Castle]] for [[Edward III of England]]. Thornton could have worked as an assistant to his father before rising to the position of designer and draughtsman.&lt;ref name=nq&gt;Knowles, J. 'John Thornton of Coventry', ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', No. 140, 481&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

Thornton was instrumental in disseminating the [[International Gothic]] style in the north and Midlands of England. The products of his workshop can be recognised by their favouring of white glass and [[silver nitrate|yellow stain]] set against blue and ruby "seaweed"-patterned backgrounds, and by the very distinctive modelling of faces.&lt;ref name=sge183&gt;Marks, p.183. Thornton's treatment of faces was expressive, using relatively heavy shading, and generally features small mouths and rather elongated noses with a bulbous tip.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thornton's masterpiece is the Great East Window of York Minster, the largest in the building and containing about {{convert|1680|sqft|m2}} of glass. According to the contract, much of the work was to be executed by his own hand, though specifically only to "pourtray [...] the histories, images, and other things to be painted on the [window]"; evidently some of the glazing would be carried out by apprentices or workmen.&lt;ref name=blair280&gt;Blair, J and Ramsay, N. ''English Medieval Industries'', CIP, 1991, p.280&lt;/ref&gt; Thornton is likely to have recruited glaziers locally in York: he seems to have been an enthusiastic teacher, and his style quickly became dominant in the area.&lt;ref name=marks182&gt;Marks, p.182&lt;/ref&gt;

Work thought to be by Thornton can also be found in several smaller churches, as well as in [[St Mary's Guildhall|St Mary's Hall]] in Coventry. His surviving windows for [[Coventry Cathedral]] were removed before it was destroyed in the [[Coventry Blitz]] and have been preserved.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/culture/stories/2002/08/cathedral-stained-glass.shtml A rare glimpse of unseen cathedral stained glass]'', [[BBC]], 23-08-02&lt;/ref&gt; He is also thought to have produced the windows from the chapel at [[Hampton Court, Herefordshire]], which are now dispersed in various collections, and seven panels in the [[Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Newark-on-Trent]].

The Thornton 'tradition' continued in York even after the middle of the 15th century, though many of the works produced show a coarsening or loss of quality compared with Thornton's authentic creations.&lt;ref name=sge185186&gt;Marks, pp.185-186&lt;/ref&gt;

Kambar Manickam, ''The Crisis of Dependency in Third World Ministries: A Critique of Inherited Missionary Forms in India'', Christian Literature Society, Madras, 1976, pp. 50, 63.[https://books.google.com/books?id=HPEcAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=kretzmann+commission&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=kretzmann]&lt;/ref&gt; up of curriculum-intensive courses&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; and the equipping of the [[Seminarians]] with capacities to lead the [[Christian Church|Church]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]].  Theological education took an upward rise with the Kretzmann Commission Report.  The Kretzmann Commission was enabled with the assistance of the Theological Education Fund of the [[World Council of Churches]] and the Board of World Missions of the [[Lutheran Church in America]].&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt;  The Secretary of the Board of Governors, [[W. D. Coleman]] on behalf of the Board of Governors published a 1,000&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; copies to be circulated among the Churches in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]].

A couple of years before the Kretzmann Commission was constituted, [[Seminarians]] deliberated on the Church's mission with special reference to [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]].  In 1966, a graduate thesis was undertaken by a candidate studying at [[Serampore College]], [[Serampore]] entitled ''The Hebrew Concept of 'Righteousness' as proclaimed by the 8th century Prophets and its implications for the Church's mission in [[Andhra Pradesh]]''&lt;ref&gt;G. Babu Rao, ''The Hebrew Concept of 'Righteousness' as proclaimed by the 8th century Prophets and its implications for the Church's mission in [[Andhra Pradesh]]'', an unpublished graduate thesis presented to the [[Senate of Serampore College (University)]] in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Bachelor of Divinity degree, Serampore, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Findings==
The Commission members met during various points of time during the latter half of 1969,&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; first on 25 October 1969 to draw up a plan and again a month later during 26–29 November to summarize its findings.  The members of the Commission met at different places for visitation and consultation.  As part of field visits,&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; the members had been to,

In addition, the members of the Commission also had special consultations&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; with [[Canon Emani Sambayya]], [[Dr.]] P. David [[Ph.D.]] ([[Yale University|Yale]]) and [[The Reverend|Rev.]] Erik W. Nielsen.  As for the background material, the Commission members accessed scholarly action reports relating&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; to the [[Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church]] Society, especially the papers of [[B. V. Subbamma]], [[S. W. Schmitthenner]], [[W. P. Peery]] and James A. Bergquist, the papers of the [[Board of Theological Education of the Senate of Serampore College]], the [[National Council of Churches in India]] and other papers.  The Commission took cognizance of the concerns of the Church in [[Andhra Pradesh]] ([[Telangana]] included).

The Commission also devised a structured questionnaire&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; for use among two kinds of respondents, the Church Leaders and the Old Students, during field visits.

==Outcome==
At the very outset, the Commission recommended for [[Indian people|Indian]] Teachers&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; to be placed in Seminaries to take up theological curriculum, especially for the core subjects in theology.  The Commission further recommended that theological education broaden its horizons in keeping up with the changing times.  Based on the recommendations of the Commission, the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]] did away with the erstwhile [[Licentiate in Theology]] programme and embarked on two graduate programmes,&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt; namely, the [[Bachelor of Theology]] and the [[Bachelor of Divinity]] degrees.  As part of the curruculum study, the Commission Members foresaw the need to include [[Worship]], Social Analysis, [[Inter-faith]], [[gender]] concerns, [[inculturation]], [[Psychology]], Language [[Usability]], personal devotion, [[Sociology]] and many other inter-disciplinary courses.&lt;ref name="Kretzmann"/&gt;  In the ensuing [[decade]], the Faculty Members were able to upgrade their academics at national and international [[Universities]] and returned to teach in the College who include,&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ACTC tower.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Bell Tower of the Protestant Regional Theologiate in [[Hyderabad]], the present campus of the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]].]] --&gt;

'''Langdon Winner''' (born August 7, 1944) is Thomas Phelan Chair of Humanities and Social Sciences in the Department of [[Science and Technology Studies]] at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], [[Troy, New York]].

Langdon Winner was born in [[San Luis Obispo, California]] on August 7, 1944. He received his B.A. in 1966, M.A. in 1967 and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1973, all in [[political science]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  His primary focus was political theory.

He has been a professor at [[University of Leiden|Leiden]], [[MIT]], [[University of California, Los Angeles]] and at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]. Since 1985 he has been at the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]; he was a visiting professor at [[Harvey Mudd College]] (2000) and Colgate University (2001).  In 2010 he was a Fulbright Fellow visiting the Universidad Complutense in Madrid.

Winner lives in upstate New York. He is married to Gail P. Stuart and has three children. His interests include [[science]], [[technology]], American [[popular culture]], and theories of [[sustainability]].

Winner is known for his articles and books on science, technology, and society. He also spent several years as a reporter, rock music critic, and contributing editor for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.langdonwinner.com/about/|title=About: Brief Biography|website=Langdon Winner (personal website)|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology and politics==
In 1980 Winner proposed that technologies embody social relations, i.e. power.&lt;ref&gt;"Do Artifacts Have Politics?" in ''Daedalus'', Vol. 109, No. 1, Winter 1980. Reprinted in ''The Social Shaping of Technology'', edited by [[Donald Angus MacKenzie|Donald A. MacKenzie]] and Judy Wajcman (London: Open University Press, 1985; second edition 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; To the question he poses "Do Artifacts Have Politics?", Winner identifies two ways in which artifacts can have politics.  The first, involving technical arrangements and social order, concerns how the invention, design, or arrangement of artifacts or the larger system becomes a mechanism for settling the affairs of a community.  This way "transcends the simple categories of 'intended' and 'unintended' altogether", representing "instances in which the very process of technical development is so thoroughly biased in a particular direction that it regularly produces results heralded as wonderful breakthroughs by some social interests and crushing setbacks by others" (Winner, p.&amp;nbsp;25-6, 1999).  It implies that the process of technological development is critical in determining the politics of an artifact; hence the importance of incorporating all stakeholders in it. (Determining who the stakeholders are and how to incorporate them are other questions entirely.)

The second way in which artifacts can have politics refers to artifacts that correlate with particular kinds of political relationships, which Winner refers to as inherently political artifacts (Winner, p.&amp;nbsp;22, 1999).  He distinguishes between two types of inherently political artifacts: those that require a particular sociological system and those that are strongly compatible with a particular sociological system (Winner, p.&amp;nbsp;29, 1999).  A further distinction is made between conditions internal to the workings of a given technical system and those that are external to it (Winner, p.&amp;nbsp;33, 1999).  This second way in which artifacts can have politics can be further articulated as consisting of four 'types' of artifacts: those requiring a particular internal sociological system, those compatible with a particular internal sociological system, those requiring a particular external sociological system, and those compatible with a particular external sociological system.

Certain features of Winner's thesis have been criticized by other scholars, including [[Bernward Joerges]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2628379/Do_Politics_Have_Artefacts_1999_ An attempted rebuttal to Winner’s argument is Bernward Joerges’ “Do Politics have Artefacts?” (Requires sign-in)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Such criticisms are often narrowly focused upon particular cases in Winner's essays, the height of the bridges built by Robert Moses on the Long Island Parkway, for example, and tend to overlook his general arguments about the interweaving of political institutions and technological devices.

==Music==
Winner contributed piano and backing vocals to the hoax album [[The Masked Marauders]] created by ''Rolling Stone''.&lt;ref name = "Rhino"&gt;{{citation | title = The Masked Marauders - The Complete Deity Recordings | publisher = Rhino Records | accessdate = 2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critique of educational technologies ==
Over the years one focus of Winner's criticism has been the excessive use of technologies in the classroom, both in K-12 schools and higher education. Winner's critique is well explained in his article "Information Technology and Educational Amnesia,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winner|first=Langdon|date=2009-12-01|title=Information Technology and Educational Amnesia|url=https://www.langdonwinner.com/other-writings/2017/6/13/information-technology-and-educational-amnesia|journal=Policy Futures in Education|volume=7|issue=6|pages=587-591|doi=10.2304/pfie.2009.7.6.587|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expressed in his satirical lecture, "The Automatic Professor Machine."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.langdonwinner.com/videos-and-music/|title=Videos and Music|website=Langdon Winner (personal website)|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Feminism sidebar |Variants (general)}}

'''Lipstick feminism''' is a variety of [[third-wave feminism]] that seeks to embrace traditional concepts of femininity, including the [[Sexual attraction|sexual power]] of women, alongside feminist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Lankford, ''Women Singer-Songwriters in Rock'' (2010) p.98&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike early feminist campaigns that focused on the basic fundamental [[rights of women]], starting with the [[Women's Suffrage]] Movement, lipstick feminism seeks to ascertain that women could still be feminist without ignoring or negating their femininity, particularly in terms of sexuality. During the [[second wave of feminism]], feminists had focused solely on legal and social equality of women and refused to 'embrace' their sexuality; some even abhorred the idea of men and would often take on physical characteristics and persona that was far from what the average woman looked like, thus creating stereotypes of what feminism and feminists looked like. Lipstick feminism, on the other hand, embraces the concepts of womanhood and the female sexuality emitted from a woman's body and the need to embrace sex. Lipstick feminism also seeks to reclaim certain derogatory words and turn them into powerful tools for their cause such as the word 'slut' as seen in the [[SlutWalk]] movement. It developed in part as a response to the [[Ideology|ideological]] backlash against radical varieties of [[second-wave feminism]], with the negative stereotypes it generated of the “ugly feminist” or the “anti-sex feminist”; in part the result of the belief that the successes of second-wave feminism had made it possible to reclaim aspects of femininity that had earlier been seen as disempowering, like make-up or stilettos.&lt;ref&gt;Natasha Walters, ''Living Dolls: The Return of Sexism'' (2010) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==

Linguistically, lipstick feminism proposed to [[semantics|semantically]] reclaim, for feminist usage, double-standard insult words, such as “slut”,&lt;ref name=wisegeek&gt;[http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-lipstick-feminism.htm What is Lipstick Feminism]&lt;/ref&gt; in order to eliminate the [[social stigma]] applied to a woman whose sexual behaviour was "[[Patriarchy|patriarchically]]" interpreted to denote “immoral woman” and [[libertine]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Hollows/R. Mosely eds., ''Feminism in Popular Culture'' (2006) p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

Philosophically, lipstick feminism proposes that a woman can be [[Power (philosophy)|empowered]] — psychologically, socially, politically – by the wearing of [[make up|cosmetic make up]], sensually-appealing clothes, and the embrace of sexual allure for her own self-image as a confidently sexual being. The rhetoric of choice and empowerment is used to validate such overt sexual practices,&lt;ref&gt;Walters, p. 28 and p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; because they no longer represent coerced acquiescence to societally established [[gender role]]s, such as “the good girl”, “the decent woman”, “the abnegated mother”, “the virtuous sister”, ''et aliæ''.

Other feminists object that the so-called empowerment of lipstick feminism is a philosophic contradiction wherein a woman chooses to sexually objectify herself, and so ceases to be her own woman, in control neither of her self nor of her person.&lt;ref name=wisegeek/&gt; In an ongoing debate, lipstick feminism counter-proposes that the practice of sexual allure is a form of social [[Power (sociology)|power]] in the [[interpersonal relations]] between a man and a woman, which may occur in the realms of cultural, social, and gender equality.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Stiletto feminism===
Stiletto feminism, a more ideologically radical variety of lipstick feminism, sees the [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] use of [[fetish fashion]] as empowering;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruthpadel.com/uncategorized/helmut-newton-and-stiletto-feminism/ Helmut Newton and Stiletto Feminism]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and extends the argument from the acceptance of makeup, to the validity of women practicing occupations specifically predicated upon female [[Beauty|physical beauty]], such as working as a [[Striptease|striptease dancer]] or as a [[pole dancing|pole dancer]], as well as [[Exhibitionism|flashing]] or lesbian (girl-on-girl) exhibitionism.

== In popular culture ==
* In the U.S. television series, ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'', the 57th episode, “[[Night Five]]”, features a scene wherein the characters debate the merits of lipstick feminism. The female protagonist decides it is empowering, while determining that sex-negativism distracts from important issues like pay equity and "honest-to-God sexual harassment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The West Wing Continuity Guide|title=#313 (57) "Night Five"

Poisonous plants are those plants that produce toxins that deter herbivores from consuming them. Plants cannot move to escape their predators, so they must have other means of protecting themselves from herbivorous animals. Some plants have physical defenses such as [[thorns, spines and prickles]], but by far the most common type of protection is chemical.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2007. [https://www.amazon.com/Plants-Vegetation-Origins-Processes-Consequences/dp/0521864801 Plants and Vegetation: Origins, Processes, Consequences]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 666 p. Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Over millennia, through the process of [[natural selection]], plants have [[evolution of plants|evolved]] the means to produce a vast and complicated array of chemical compounds in order to deter herbivores. [[Tannin]], for example, is a defensive compound that emerged relatively early in the evolutionary history of plants, while more complex molecules such as [[polyyne|polyacetylenes]] are found in younger groups of plants such as the [[Asterales]]. Many of the known [[Plant defense against herbivory|plant defense compounds]] primarily defend against consumption by insects, though other animals, including humans, that consume such plants may also experience negative effects, ranging from mild discomfort to death.

Many of these poisonous compounds also have important medicinal benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, W.H. and M.P.F. Elvin-Lewis. 1977. Medical Botany. Plants Affecting Man's Health. Wiley, New York. 515 p. p. 123-124.&lt;/ref&gt; The varieties of [[phytochemistry|phytochemical]] defenses in plants are so numerous that many questions about them remain unanswered, including:

# Which plants have which types of defense?
# Which herbivores, specifically, are the plants defended against?
# What chemical structures and mechanisms of toxicity are involved in the compounds that provide defense?
# What are the potential medical uses of these compounds?

These questions and others constitute an active area of research in modern [[botany]], with important implications for understanding plant evolution and for medical science.

Below is an extensive, if incomplete, list of [[plant]]s containing [[poison]]ous parts that pose a serious risk of [[disease|illness]], injury, or [[death]] to [[human]]s or [[animal]]s. There is significant overlap between plants considered poisonous and those with [[psychedelic plants|psychotropic properties]], some of which are toxic enough to present serious health risks at recreational doses. It is also important to remember that there is a distinction between plants that are poisonous because they naturally produce dangerous phytochemicals, and those that may become dangerous for other reasons, including but not limited to infection by bacterial, viral, or fungal parasites, the uptake of [[phytotoxin|toxic compounds]] through contaminated soil or groundwater, and/or the ordinary processes of decay after the plant has died; this list deals exclusively with the former. Many plants, such as [[peanut]]s, also produce compounds that are only dangerous to people who have developed an [[allergy|allergic reaction]] to them, and with a few exceptions, those plants are not included on this list (see [[list of allergens]] instead). Human fatalities caused by poisonous plants – especially resulting from accidental ingestion – are rare in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Krenzelok EP, Mrvos R.,"Friends and foes in the plant world: A profile of plant ingestions and fatalities."  Clin Toxicol. 2011 Mar;49(3):142-9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poisonous food plants ==

Many plants commonly used as food possess toxic parts, are toxic unless processed, or are toxic at certain stages of their lives. Some only pose a serious threat to certain animals (such as cats, dogs, or livestock) or certain types of people (such as infants, the elderly, or individuals with pathological vulnerabilities). Most of these food plants are safe for the average adult to eat in modest quantities. Notable examples include:

| [[Apple]]
| ''[[Malus domestica]]''
| Seeds are mildly poisonous, containing a small amount of [[amygdalin]], a [[cyanide|cyanogenic]] [[glycoside]]. The quantity contained is usually not enough to be dangerous to humans, but it is possible to ingest enough seeds to provide a fatal dose.

|-
| [[Asparagus]]
| ''[[Asparagus officinalis]]''
| Several species including ''[[Asparagus officinalis]]'' and ''[[Asparagus densiflorus]]''. Though asparagus plants cultivated for food are typically harvested before they reach reproductive maturity, the berries of the mature plant are poisonous, containing furostanol and spirostanol [[saponin]]s. Rapid ingestion of more than five to seven ripe berries can induce abdominal pain and vomiting. Sulfur compounds in the young shoots are also considered at least partially responsible for mild skin reactions in some people who handle the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gardengrow.co.nz/plant/Asparagus |title=Growing Asparagus |publisher=gardengrow.co.nz |accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asparagus-friends.com/asparagus-knowledge/poisonous-asparagus/ |title=Poisonous Asparagus |publisher=asparagus-friends.com |accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Cassava]]
| ''[[Manihot esculenta]]''
| Roots and leaves contain two [[cyanogenic glycoside]]s, [[linamarin]] and [[lotaustralin]]. These are decomposed by [[linamarase]], a naturally occurring [[enzyme]] in cassava, liberating [[hydrogen cyanide]] .&lt;ref name="cereda"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cereda | first1 = M. P. | last2 = Mattos | first2 = M. C.

The 'sweet' cultivars can produce as little as 20 milligrams of [[cyanide]] per kilogram of fresh roots, whereas bitter ones may produce more than 50 times as much (1&amp;nbsp;g/kg). Cassavas grown during [[drought]] are especially high in these toxins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aregheore EM, Agunbiade OO | title = The toxic effects of cassava (manihot esculenta grantz) diets on humans: a review. | journal = Vet.

It can also cause severe calcific pancreatitis in humans, leading to chronic pancreatitis. Processing (soaking, cooking, fermentation, etc.) of cassava root is necessary to remove the toxins and avoid getting sick. In the tropics, where cassava farming is a major industry, "Chronic, low-level cyanide exposure is associated with the development of [[goiter]] and with tropical ataxic neuropathy, a nerve-damaging disorder that renders a person unsteady and uncoordinated. Severe cyanide poisoning, particularly during famines, is associated with outbreaks of a debilitating, irreversible paralytic disorder called [[konzo]] and, in some cases, death. The incidence of konzo and tropical ataxic neuropathy can be as high as 3 percent in some areas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The cyanide is carried away in the processing water and the amounts produced in domestic consumption are too small to have environmental impact.&lt;ref name="cereda" /&gt; The larger-rooted, bitter varieties used for production of flour or starch must be processed to remove the cyanogenic glycosides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Padmaja G | title = Cyanide detoxification in cassava for food and feed uses | journal = Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 299–339 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7576161 | doi = 10.1080/10408399509527703 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial production of cassava flour, even at the cottage level, may generate enough cyanide and cyanogenic glycosides in the effluvia to have a severe environmental impact.&lt;ref name="cereda" /&gt;

| [[Cherry]]
| ''[[Prunus cerasus]]''
| As well as other ''[[Prunus]]'' species such as [[peach]] (''Prunus persica''), [[plum]] (''Prunus domestica''), [[almond]] (''Prunus dulcis''), and [[apricot]] (''Prunus armeniaca''). Leaves and seeds contain [[amygdalin]], a [[cyanogenic glycoside]].

| [[Grape]]
| ''[[Vitis]]'' spp.
| Potentially toxic to dogs, although the precise mechanism is not fully understood. See [[grape and raisin toxicity in dogs]].

|-
| [[Lathyrus sativus|Indian pea]]
| ''[[Lathyrus sativus]]''
| A legume grown in Asia and East Africa as an insurance crop for use during famines. Like other grain legumes, ''L. sativus'' produces a high-protein seed. The seeds contain variable amounts of [[Oxalyldiaminopropionic acid|β-N-Oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid]] or ODAP, a [[neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] [[amino acid]].&lt;ref name="pmid14155110"&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Rao SL, Adiga PR, Sarma PS | title = The Isolation and Characterization of β-N-Oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid: A Neurotoxin from the Seeds of Lathyrus sativus | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 432–6 | year = 1964 | pmid = 14155110 | doi = 10.1021/bi00891a022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ODAP causes wasting and [[paralysis]] if eaten over a long period, and is considered the cause of the disease [[neurolathyrism]], a [[neurodegenerative]] disease that causes paralysis of the lower body and emaciation of gluteal muscle (buttocks). The disease has been seen to occur after [[famine]]s in Europe (France, Spain, Germany), North Africa and South Asia, and is still prevalent in Eritrea, Ethiopia and parts of Afghanistan when ''Lathyrus'' seed is the exclusive or main source of nutrients for extended periods.

|-
| [[Common bean#Red or kidney beans|Kidney bean]] or ''common bean''
| ''[[Phaseolus vulgaris]]''
|  The toxic compound [[phytohaemagglutinin]], a [[lectin]], is present in many varieties of common bean but is especially concentrated in red kidney beans. The lectin has a number of effects on cell metabolism; it induces [[mitosis]], and affects the cell membrane in regard to transport and [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]] to proteins. It [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutinates]] most mammalian [[red blood cell]] types. Consumption of as few as four or five raw kidney beans may be sufficient to trigger symptoms, which include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Onset is from 1 to 3 hours after consumption of improperly prepared beans, and symptoms typically resolve within a few hours.&lt;ref name=FDA /&gt; Phytohaemagglutinin can be deactivated by cooking beans at {{convert|100|°C|°F}} for ten minutes, which is required to degrade the toxin and is much shorter than the hours required to fully cook the beans themselves. For dry beans the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) also recommends an initial soak of at least 5 hours in water, after which the soaking water should be discarded.&lt;ref name=FDA&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=11 July 2009 |url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm071092.htm |title=Foodborne Pathogenic Microorganisms and Natural Toxins Handbook: Phytohaemagglutinin |work=[[Bad Bug Book]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, lower cooking temperatures may have the paradoxical effect of potentiating the toxic effect of haemagglutinin. Beans cooked at {{convert|80|°C|°F}} are reported to be up to five times as toxic as raw beans.&lt;ref name=FDA /&gt; Outbreaks of poisoning have been associated with the use of [[slow cooker]]s, the low cooking temperatures of which may be unable to degrade the toxin.

| [[Phaseolus lunatus|Lima bean]] or ''butter bean''
| ''[[Phaseolus lunatus]]''
| Raw beans contain dangerous amounts of [[linamarin]], a [[cyanide|cyanogenic]] [[glycoside]].
|
|-
| [[Lemon]]
| ''[[Citrus limon]]''
| As well as [[lime (fruit)|lime]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] and other [[citrus fruit]]s are known to contain aromatic oils and compounds of [[Psoralen]] which is toxic to dogs, cats, and some animals. The acid is found all over the entire plant. Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, depression and [[photosensitivity]].
| [[File:Lemon, Lime and Orange.jpg|200x200px]]

|-
| [[Mango|Mango tree]]
| ''[[Mangifera indica]]''
| Mango peel and sap contain [[urushiol]], the allergen in poison ivy and poison sumac that can cause [[urushiol-induced contact dermatitis]] in susceptible people. Cross-reactions between mango contact allergens and urushiol have been observed. Those with a history of poison ivy or poison oak contact dermatitis may be most at risk for such an allergic reaction. Urushiol is also present in mango leaves and stems. During mango's primary ripening season, it is the most common source of plant dermatitis in Hawaii.

| [[Nutmeg]]
| ''[[Myristica fragrans]]''
| Contains [[myristicin]], a naturally occurring [[insecticide]] and [[acaricide]] with possible [[neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] effects on [[neuroblastoma]] cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee BK, Kim JH, Jung JW, Choi JW, Han ES, Lee SH, Ko KH, Ryu JH | title = Myristicin-induced neurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells | journal = Toxicol.

| [[Allium|Onions and garlic]]
| ''[[Allium]]'' spp.
| Many members of the genus ''Allium'' contain [[thiosulphate]], which in high doses is toxic to dogs, cats and some types of livestock. Cats are more sensitive.
|
|-
| [[Potato]]
| ''[[Solanum tuberosum]]''
| Potatoes contain toxic compounds known as [[glycoalkaloid]]s, of which the most prevalent are [[solanine]] and [[chaconine]]. Solanine is also found in other members of the [[Solanaceae]] plant family, which includes ''Atropa belladonna'' ("deadly nightshade") and ''Hyoscyamus niger'' ("henbane") (see entries below). The concentration of glycoalkaloid in wild potatoes is sufficient to produce toxic effects in humans. The toxin affects the nervous system, causing [[headache]]s, [[diarrhea]] and intense digestive disturbances, [[cramps]], weakness and confusion, and in severe cases [[coma]] and death. Poisoning from cultivated potatoes occurs very rarely, however, as toxic compounds in the potato plant are generally concentrated in the green portions of the plant and in the fruits, and cultivated varieties contain smaller concentrations than wild plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tomato-like Fruit on Potato Plants |publisher=[[Iowa State University]] |url=http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/hortnews/2004/7-2-2004/tomatopotato.html |accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Glycoalkaloid and calystegine contents of eight potato cultivars''[http://grande.nal.usda.gov/ibids/index.php?mode2=detail&amp;origin=ibids_references&amp;therow=728718 J-Agric-Food-Chem. 2003 May 7; 51(10): 2964–73] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211003132/http://grande.nal.usda.gov/ibids/index.php?mode2=detail&amp;origin=ibids_references&amp;therow=728718 |date=11 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooking at high temperatures (over 170&amp;nbsp;°C or 340&amp;nbsp;°F) also partly destroys the toxin. However, exposure to light, physical damage, and age can increase glycoalkaloid content within the tuber,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greening of potatoes |publisher=Food Science Australia |year=2005 |url=http://www.foodscience.afisc.csiro.au/spuds.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990224092343/http://www.foodscience.afisc.csiro.au/spuds.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 February 1999 |accessdate=15 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the highest concentrations occurring just underneath the skin. Tubers that are exposed to light turn green from [[chlorophyll]] synthesis, thus giving a visual clue as to areas of the tuber that may have become more toxic; however, this does not provide a definitive guide, as greening and glycoalkaloid accumulation can occur independently of each other. Some varieties of potato contain greater glycoalkaloid concentrations than others; breeders developing new varieties test for this, and sometimes have to discard an otherwise promising [[cultivar]]. Breeders try to keep solanine levels below 200&amp;nbsp;mg/kg (200 ppmw). However, when these commercial varieties turn green, even they can approach concentrations of solanine of 1000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg (1000 ppmw). The [[U.S. National Toxicology Program]] suggests that the average American consume no more than 12.5&amp;nbsp;mg/day of solanine from potatoes (the toxic dose is actually several times this, depending on body weight).

|-
| [[Rhubarb]]
| ''[[Rheum rhaponticum]]''
| The leaf stalks ([[petiole (botany)|petioles]]) are edible, but the leaves themselves contain notable quantities of [[oxalic acid]], which is a [[nephrotoxic]] and [[corrosive]] acid present in many plants. Symptoms of poisoning include kidney disorders, convulsions and coma, though it is rarely fatal. The {{LD50}} (median lethal dose) for pure oxalic acid in rats is about 375&amp;nbsp;mg/kg [[body weight]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rhurbarb poisoning on rhurbabinfo.com|url=http://www.rhubarbinfo.com/rhubarb-poison.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; or about 25 grams for a 65&amp;nbsp;kg (~140&amp;nbsp;lb) human. Although the oxalic acid content of rhubarb leaves can vary, a typical value is about 0.5%,&lt;ref&gt;GW Pucher, AJ Wakeman, HB Vickery.

On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen.  New York, NY: Scribner, 2004. p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; This means that even the raw stalks may not be hazardous (though they are generally thought to be in the US). However, the tart taste of the raw stalks is so strong as to be unpalatable to most consumers.

== Other poisonous plants ==

Countless other plants not commonly used as food are also poisonous, and care should be taken to avoid accidentally contacting or ingesting them:

| '''''[[Abrus precatorius]]'''''
| Known commonly as '''jequirity''', '''crab's eye''', '''rosary pea''', '''''{{'}}John Crow{{'}}'' bead''', '''precatory bean''', '''Indian licorice''', '''akar saga''', '''giddee giddee''', '''[[jumbie]] bead''', '''ruti''', and '''weather plant'''. The attractive seeds (usually about the size of a ladybug, glossy red with one black dot) contain [[abrin]], a ribosome-inactivating protein related to [[ricin]], and very potent. Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, convulsions, liver failure, and death, usually after several days. Ingesting a single seed can kill an adult human. The seeds have been used as beads in jewelry, which is dangerous; inhaled dust is toxic and pinpricks can be fatal. The seeds are unfortunately attractive to children.

|-
| '''''[[Aconitum]]''''' '''genus'''
| Several species, commonly called '''aconite''', '''wolfsbane''' and '''monkshood'''. All parts are poisonous. The poison is an alkaloid called [[aconitine]], which disables nerves, lowers blood pressure, and can stop the heart. Even casual skin contact should be avoided; symptoms include numbness, tingling, and cardiac irregularity. It has been used as poison for bullets (by German forces during World War II), as a bait and arrow poison (ancient Greece), and to poison water supplies (reports from ancient Asia).{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} If ingested, it usually causes burning, tingling, and numbness in the mouth, followed by vomiting and nervous excitement. It is usually a quick-acting poison, and has been used in the past for killing wolves (hence one of the common names).

| Commonly known as '''autumn crocus''' and '''meadow saffron'''. The bulbs contain [[colchicine]]. Colchicine poisoning has been compared to [[arsenic]] poisoning; symptoms typically start 2 to 5 hours after a toxic dose has been ingested but may take up to 24 hours to appear, and include burning in the mouth and throat, [[fever]], [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], [[abdominal pain]] and [[renal failure|kidney failure]]. Onset of multiple-system organ failure may occur within 24 to 72 hours. This includes [[hypovolemic shock]] due to extreme vascular damage and fluid loss through the [[GI tract]], which may result in death. Additionally, sufferers may experience kidney damage resulting in low urine output and bloody urine, low white blood cell counts (persisting for several days), [[anemia]], muscular weakness, and [[respiratory failure]].

Signs that a horse has been poisoned include yellow mucus membranes, depression, and lack of coordination. The danger is that the toxin can have a cumulative effect; the alkaloid does not actually accumulate in the liver but a breakdown product can damage [[DNA]] and progressively kills cells. ''Jacobaea vulgaris'' is also theoretically poisonous to humans, although poisoning is unlikely as it is distasteful and not used as a food. However, some sensitive individuals can suffer from an allergic skin reaction after handling the plant because, like many members of the family Compositae, it contains sesquiterpine [[lactone]]s (which are different from the [[pyrrolizidine alkaloids]] responsible for the toxic effects), which can cause compositae dermatitis.

All parts of these plants contain a highly irritating oil with [[urushiol]]. Skin reactions can include blisters and rashes. The oil spreads readily to clothes and back again, and has a very long life. Infections can follow scratching. Despite the common names, urushiol is actually not a poison but an [[allergen]], and because of this it will not affect certain people. The smoke of burning poison ivy can cause reactions in the lungs, and can be fatal. The [[urushiol-induced contact dermatitis|allergic reaction]] caused by contact with [[Toxicodendron radicans|poison ivy]] afflicts more than 70% of the human population, with as many as 350,000 cases reported annually in the United States alone

The seedlings and seeds are the most toxic parts of the plants. Symptoms usually occur within a few hours, producing unsteadiness and weakness, depression, [[nausea]] and vomiting, twisting of the neck muscles, rapid and weak pulse, difficulty breathing, and eventually death. ''Xanthium'' has also been used for its medicinal properties and for making yellow dye, as indicated by its name (Greek ''xanthos'' = 'yellow').

'''Museolog''' is a web-driven [[software]] system for cataloging museum information. It is an advanced tool for museum records management, based on the international standards. It was developed by EUROCLID within the UNESCO HeritageNet project, and localized by the non-governmental organization, Open Systems. Using this software, initial functions of input and editing of museum catalogues are provided what has been described as "a modern intuitive graphical interface using forms and menus." Museolog is [[free software]] released under the [[GNU GPL]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/museolog/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Managing museum objects==

Museolog allows the user to create a record across several interactive sessions. It is also possible to save non-validated, incomplete records for future completion.

Access to the database is regulated by a system of managing access rights, to various levels of functionaries in the museum.

It is also possible manage object movements (when an object is moved from one place to another within the museum, or on loan to an external place), and restoration work. To track movement, a 'movement sheet' is printed. This software allows the user to print a list of all objects on loan, including details like origin and destination place.

When restoration work is undertaken, the type of work (e.g. cleaning), the physical method used, and digital photos taken before and after can be recorded.

==Searching the museum==

Searching and selecting records is also possible, from the catalogue, through the use of Boolean queries. Retrieved records are shown as a short-list of titles; clicking on any would show the full record. Selected records are printable, with any relevant images inserted in the document.

In keeping with current methods of photographing museum exhibits, digital images are indexed in the database. These images are archived, using recordable CD-roms. CDs are then numbered and indexed in the database, making retrieval easy of all museum objects.

==More functions==

Users can save the current state of the database on a CD-R; there is the possibility of rebuilding this when needed due to any possible hardware or software crash. Data from the database can also be exported in XML format, making it transferable to other databases or website. This software also allows for managing [[thesauri]] and authority lists. Users can load, browse, edit and export [[thesauri]] and terminology resources, thus allowing for cooperative terminology definition and exchanges.

==Versions available==

As of [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=134556 July 7, 2007] the versions that were available were [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=134556&amp;package_id=148371 4.5-6 for Linux] and [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=134556&amp;package_id=148372 4.6 for Windows], both released in mid-2005.

'''Music theory''' is the study of the practices and possibilities of [[music]]. ''The Oxford Companion to Music'' describes three interrelated uses of the term "music theory":

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first is what is otherwise called '[[Elements of music|rudiments]]', currently taught as the elements of notation, of key signatures, of time signatures, of rhythmic notation, and so on. [...] The second is the study of writings about music from ancient times onwards. [...] The third is an area of current musicological study that seeks to define processes and general principles in music — a sphere of research that can be distinguished from analysis in that it takes as its starting-point not the individual work or performance but the fundamental materials from which it is built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fallows|first1=David|title=Theory|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t114/e6759.|website=The Oxford Companion to Music|publisher=Oxford Music Online|accessdate=11 September 2016}}{{Dead link|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Music theory is frequently concerned with describing how musicians and composers make music, including tuning systems and composition methods among other topics. Because of the ever-expanding conception of what constitutes music (see [[Definition of music]]), a more inclusive definition could be that music theory is the consideration of any sonic phenomena, including silence, as they relate to music. This is not an absolute guideline; for example, the study of "music" in the ''[[Quadrivium]]'' liberal arts university curriculum that was common in medieval Europe was an abstract system of proportions that was carefully studied at a distance from actual musical practice.&lt;ref&gt;See Boethius's ''De institutione musica'', in which he disdains "musica instrumentalis" as beneath the "true" musician who studies music in the abstract: ''Multo enim est maius atque auctius scire, quod quisque faciat, quam ipsum illud efficere, quod sciat'' ("It is much better to know what one does than to do what one knows").&lt;/ref&gt; However, this medieval discipline became the basis for tuning systems in later centuries, and it is generally included in modern scholarship on the history of music theory.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, chapters 4–7 of Christensen, Thomas (2002). ''The Cambridge History of Western Music Theory''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music theory as a practical discipline encompasses the methods and concepts [[composers]] and other musicians use in creating music. The development, preservation, and transmission of music theory in this sense may be found in oral and written music-making traditions, musical instruments, and other artifacts. For example, ancient instruments from [[Music of ancient Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]], [[Chinese Music|China]],{{sfn|Latham|2002|loc=15–17}} and prehistoric sites around the world reveal details about the music they produced and potentially something of the musical theory that might have been used by their makers (see [[History of music]] and [[Musical instrument]]). In ancient and living cultures around the world, the deep and long roots of music theory are clearly visible in instruments, oral traditions, and current music making. Many cultures, at least as far back as ancient Mesopotamia and ancient China, have also considered music theory in more formal ways such as written treatises and music notation. Practical and scholarly traditions overlap, as many practical treatises about music place themselves within a tradition of other treatises, which are cited regularly just as scholarly writing cites earlier research.

In modern academia, music theory is a subfield of [[musicology]], the wider study of musical cultures and history. Etymologically, ''music theory'' is an act of contemplation of music, from the Greek θεωρία, a looking at, viewing, contemplation, speculation, theory, also a sight, a spectacle.{{sfn|OED|2005}} As such, it is often concerned with abstract musical aspects such as tuning and tonal systems, scales, consonance and dissonance, and rhythmic relationships, but there is also a body of theory concerning practical aspects, such as the creation or the performance of music, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, and electronic sound production.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=Theory, theorists. 1. Definitions}} A person who researches, teaches, or writes articles about music theory is a music theorist. University study, typically to the [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] or [[Ph.D]] level, is required to teach as a tenure-track music theorist in a US or Canadian university. Methods of analysis include mathematics, graphic analysis, and especially analysis enabled by Western music notation. Comparative, descriptive, statistical, and other methods are also used. Music theory textbooks, especially in the United States of America, often include elements of [[musical acoustics]], considerations of [[musical notation]], and techniques of tonal [[Musical composition|composition]] ([[harmony]] and [[counterpoint]]), among other topics.

==History==

===Prehistory===
{{Main article|Prehistoric music}}

Preserved prehistoric instruments, artifacts, and later depictions of performance in artworks can give clues to the structure of pitch systems in prehistoric cultures. See for instance [[Paleolithic flutes]], [[Gudi (instrument)|Gǔdí]], and [[Anasazi flute]].

===Antiquity===

====Mesopotamia====
{{see also|Music of Mesopotamia}}

Several surviving Sumerian and Akkadian clay tablets include musical information of a theoretical nature, mainly lists of intervals and tunings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mirelman|2010}}; {{harvnb|Mirelman|2013}}; {{harvnb|Wulstan|1968}}; {{harvnb|Kümmel|1970}}; {{harvnb|Kilmer|1971}}; {{harvnb|Kilmer and Mirelman|n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar Sam Mirelman reports that the earliest of these texts dates from before 1500&amp;nbsp;BCE, a millennium earlier than surviving evidence from any other culture of comparable musical thought. Further, "All the Mesopotamian texts [about music] are united by the use of a terminology for music that, according to the approximate dating of the texts, was in use for over 1,000 years."{{sfn|Mirelman|2013|loc=43–44}}

====China====
{{see also|Music of China|Chinese musicology}}

Much of Chinese music history and theory remains unclear.&lt;ref name="oxfordmusiconline.com"&gt;Joseph S.C. Lam, "China.", §II, "History and Theory", ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press, accessed November 15, 2015, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43141pg2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest texts about Chinese music theory are inscribed on the stone and bronze bells excavated in 1978 from the tomb of Marquis Yi (died 433&amp;nbsp;BCE) of the Zeng state. They include more than 2800 words describing theories and practices of music pitches of the time. The bells produce two intertwined pentatonic scales three tones apart with additional pitches completing the chromatic scale.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bagley, "The Prehistory of Chinese Music Theory", ''Proceedings of the British Academy'' 131, 2004 (Lectures), pp. 41–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese theory starts from numbers, the main musical numbers being twelve, five and eight. Twelve refers to the number of pitches on which the scales can be constructed. The [[Lüshi chunqiu]] from about 239&amp;nbsp;BCE recalls the legend of Ling Lun. On order of the Yellow Emperor, Ling Lun collected twelve bamboo lengths with thick and even nodes. Blowing on one of these like a pipe, he found its sound agreeable and named it ''huangzhong'', the "Yellow Bell." He then heard phoenixes singing. The male and female phoenix each sang six tones. Ling Lun cut his bamboo pipes to match the pitches of the phoenixes, producing twelve pitch pipes in two sets: six from the male phoenix and six from the female: these were called the ''lülü'' or later the ''shierlü''.{{sfn|Service|2013}}

The ''lülü'' formed the ritual scale to which many instruments were tuned. The name of the lowest sound, ''huangzhong'' also implied 'musical correctness.' Its pitch formed a pitch standard, setting the base pitch of zithers, flutes and singers of imperial court orchestras. Straight-walled pitch pipes without finger holes were made of cast metal, their lengths specified by court regulations.{{sfn|Crease|2011|loc=40–41}} The resulting chromatic scale provided twelve fundamental notes for the construction of the musical scales themselves. The ''lülü'' also has a cosmological value: its notes describe the energetic frequency of the twelve months of the year, the daily rhythm of the twelve bi-hours of the Chinese clock, the twelve main acupuncture meridians, etc.{{sfn|Wu and Wu|2014|loc=41–42}}

The two sets of tones (male and female) dividing the twelve-tone scale were generated by the "Method of Subtracting and Adding Thirds," or ''sanfen sunyi'', which involved alternately rising a fifth and descending a fourth through the subtraction or addition of a third of the length of the preceding pitch pipe. The resulting pitches produced by adding a third (and descending a fourth) were referred to by [[Sima Qian]] in the [[Records of the Grand Historian]] (91&amp;nbsp;BCE) as pitches of "superior generation," that is, the pitches of Ling Lun’s male phoenix; the pitches produced by subtracting a third (and ascending a fifth) were referred to as pitches of "inferior generation," that is, the pitches of Ling Lun’s female phoenix.{{sfn|Service|2013}}

"Apart from technical and structural aspects, ancient Chinese music theory also discusses topics such as the nature and functions of music. The ''Yueji'' ("Record of music", c1st and 2nd centuries BCE), for example, manifests Confucian moral theories of understanding music in its social context. Studied and implemented by Confucian scholar-officials [...], these theories helped form a musical Confucianism that overshadowed but did not erase rival approaches. These include the assertion of Mozi (c468–c376&amp;nbsp;BCE) that music wasted human and material resources, and Laozi’s claim that the greatest music had no sounds. [...] Even the music of the ''qin'' zither, a genre closely affiliated with Confucian scholar-officials, includes many works with Daoist references, such as ''Tianfeng huanpei'' ("Heavenly Breeze and Sounds of Jade Pendants")."&lt;ref name="oxfordmusiconline.com"/&gt;

====India====
The [[Samaveda]] and [[Yajurveda]] (c. 1200 – 1000&amp;nbsp;BCE) are among the earliest testimonies of Indian music, but they contain no theory properly speaking. The [[Natya Shastra]], written between 200&amp;nbsp;BCE to 200&amp;nbsp;CE, discusses intervals (''Śrutis''), scales (''Grāmas''), consonances and dissonances, classes of melodic structure (''Mūrchanās'', modes?), melodic types (''Jātis''), instruments, etc.&lt;ref&gt;''The Nāțyaśāstra, A Treatise on Hindu Dramaturgy and Histrionics, attributed to Bharata-Muni'', translated from the Sanskrit with introduction and notes by Manomohan Ghosh, vol. II, Calcutta, The Asiatic Society, 1961. See particularly pp. 5–19 of the Introduction, ''The Ancient Indian Theory and Practice of Music''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greece====
{{see also|Musical system of ancient Greece|List of music theorists#Antiquity}}

Early preserved Greek writings on music theory include two types of works:&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Mathiesen, "Greek Music Theory", ''The Cambridge History of Western Music Theory'', Th. Christensen ed., Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2002, pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt;
* technical manuals describing the Greek musical system including notation, scales, consonance and dissonance, rhythm, and types of musical compositions
* treatises on the way in which music reveals universal patterns of order leading to the highest levels of knowledge and understanding.
Several names of theorists are known before these works, including [[Pythagoras]] (c. 570 – c. 495&amp;nbsp;BCE), [[Philolaus]] (c. 470 – c. 385&amp;nbsp;BCE), [[Archytas]] (428–347&amp;nbsp;BCE), and others.

Works of the first type (technical manuals) include
* Anonymous (erroneously attributed to [[Euclid]]) ''Division of the Canon'', Κατατομή κανόνος, 4th–3rd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;English translation in Andrew Barker, ''Greek Musical Writings'', vol. 2: ''Harmonic and Acoustic Theory'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1989, pp. 191–208.&lt;/ref&gt;

More philosophical treatises of the second type include
* [[Aristoxenus]], ''Harmonic Elements'', Άρμονικά στοιχεία, 375/360 – after 320&amp;nbsp;BCE.
* [[Aristoxenus]], ''Rhythmic Elements'', Ρυθμικά στοιχεία.

====China====
Some imported early Chinese instruments became important components of the entertainment music of the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] (581–618) and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] (618–907) courts: the bent-neck [[pipa]] (quxiang pipa), the [[Guan (instrument)|bili]], the [[konghou]] and the [[jiegu]]. They generated not only new repertories and performing practices but also new music theories. The pipa, for example, carried with it a theory of musical modes that subsequently led to the Sui and Tang theory of 84 musical modes.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph S.C.

====Europe====
The Latin treatise ''De institutione musica'' by the Roman philosopher [[Boethius]] (written c. 500) was a touchstone for other writings on music in medieval Europe. Boethius represented Classical authority on music during the Middle Ages, as the Greek writings on which he based his work were not read or translated by later Europeans until the 15th century.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=§5 Early Middle Ages}} This treatise carefully maintains distance from the actual practice of music, focusing mostly on the mathematical proportions involved in tuning systems and on the moral character of particular modes. Several centuries later, treatises began to appear which dealt with the actual composition of pieces of music in the [[plainchant]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=Theory, theorists §5 Early Middle Ages}}: "Boethius could provide a model only for that part of theory which underlies but does not give rules for composition or performance. The first surviving strictly musical treatise of Carolingian times is directed towards musical practice, the Musica disciplina of Aurelian of Réôme (9th century)."&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the ninth century, [[Hucbald]] worked towards more precise pitch notation for the [[neume]]s used to record plainchant.

[[Guido d'Arezzo]]' wrote in 1028 a letter to Michael of Pomposa, entitled ''Epistola de ignoto cantu'',&lt;ref&gt;For a modern edition of the letter, see [http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/gui_epi.html].&lt;/ref&gt; in which he introduced the practice of using syllables to describe notes and intervals. This was the source of the hexachordal [[solmization]] that was to be used until the end of the Middle Ages. Guido also wrote about emotional qualities of the modes, the phrase structure of plainchant, the temporal meaning of the neumes, etc.; his chapters on polyphony "come closer to describing and illustrating real music than any previous account" in the Western tradition.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=§5 Early Middle Ages}}

During the thirteenth century, a new rhythm system called [[mensural notation]] grew out of an earlier, more limited method of notating rhythms in terms of fixed repetitive patterns, the so-called rhythmic modes, which were developed in France around 1200. An early form of mensural notation was first described and codified in the treatise ''Ars cantus mensurabilis'' ("The art of measured chant") by [[Franco of Cologne]] (c. 1280). Mensural notation used different note shapes to specify different durations, allowing scribes to capture rhythms which varied instead of repeating the same fixed pattern; it is a proportional notation, in the sense that each note value is equal to two or three times the shorter value, or half or a third of the longer value. This same notation, transformed through various extensions and improvements during the Renaissance, forms the basis for rhythmic notation in European classical music today.

As Western musical influence spread throughout the world in the 1800s, musicians adopted Western theory as an international standard—but other theoretical traditions in both textual and oral traditions remain in use. For example, the long and rich musical traditions unique to ancient and current cultures of Africa are primarily oral, but describe specific forms, genres, performance practices, tunings, and other aspects of music theory.{{sfn|Kubik|2010|loc=passim}}{{sfn|Ekwueme|1974|loc=passim}}

[[Sacred Harp]] music uses a different kind of scale and theory in practice. The music focuses around the solfege "fa, sol, la" on the music scale. Sacred Harp also employs a different notation involving "shape notes", or notes that are shaped to correspond to a certain solfege syllable on the music scale. Sacred Harp music and its music theory originated with Reverend Thomas Symmes in 1720, where he developed a system for "singing by note" in order to help his church members with note accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sacred Harp: A Tradition and Its Music|last=Cobb, Jr.|first=Buell E.|publisher=The University of Georgia Press Athens|year=1978|isbn=0-8203-0426-3|location=United States of America|pages=4–5, 60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamentals of music==
{{Main article|Aspect of music}}
Music is composed of [[aural]] phenomena; "music theory" considers how those phenomena apply in music. Music theory considers melody, rhythm, counterpoint, harmony, form, tonal systems, scales, tuning, intervals, consonance, dissonance, durational proportions, the acoustics of pitch systems, composition, performance, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, electronic sound production, etc.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.}}

===Pitch===
{{Main article|Pitch (music)}}
[[File:Middle C.png|thumb|Middle C (261.626&amp;nbsp;Hz) {{audio|Middle C.mid|Play}}.]]
Pitch is the lowness or highness of a [[Musical tone|tone]], for example the difference between [[middle C]] and a higher C. The frequency of the sound waves producing a pitch can be measured precisely, but the perception of pitch is more complex because single notes from natural sources are usually a complex mix of many frequencies. Accordingly, theorists often describe pitch as a subjective sensation.{{sfn|Hartmann|2005|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}

Specific frequencies are often assigned letter names. Today most orchestras assign [[Concert A]] (the A above [[middle C]] on the piano) to the frequency of 440&amp;nbsp;Hz. This assignment is somewhat arbitrary; for example, in 1859 France, the same A was tuned to 435&amp;nbsp;Hz. Such differences can have a noticeable effect on the timbre of instruments and other phenomena. Thus, in [[historically informed performance]] of older music, tuning is often set to match the tuning used in the period when it was written. Additionally, many cultures do not attempt to standardize pitch, often considering that it should be allowed to vary depending on genre, style, mood, etc.

The difference in pitch between two notes is called an [[interval (music)|interval]]. The most basic interval is the [[unison]], which is simply two notes of the same pitch. The [[octave]] interval is two pitches that are either double or half the frequency of one another. The unique characteristics of octaves gave rise to the concept of [[pitch class]]: pitches of the same letter name that occur in different octaves may be grouped into a single "class" by ignoring the difference in octave. For example, a high C and a low C are members of the same pitch class—the class that contains all C's. {{sfn|Bartlette and Laitz|2010|loc={{Page needed|date=October 2014}}}}

[[Musical tuning|Musical tuning systems]], or temperaments, determine the precise size of intervals. Tuning systems vary widely within and between world cultures. In [[Western culture]], there have long been several competing tuning systems, all with different qualities. Internationally, the system known as [[equal temperament]] is most commonly used today because it is considered the most satisfactory compromise that allows instruments of fixed tuning (e.g. the piano) to sound acceptably in tune in all keys.

===Scales and modes===

Notes can be arranged in a variety of [[scale (music)|scale]]s and [[musical mode|modes]]. Western music theory generally divides the octave into a series of twelve tones, called a [[chromatic scale]], within which the interval between adjacent tones is called a half step or [[semitone]]. Selecting tones from this set of 12 and arranging them in patterns of semitones and whole tones creates other scales.{{sfn|Touma|1996|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}

The most commonly encountered scales are the seven-toned [[major scale|major]], the [[harmonic minor]], the [[melodic minor]], and the [[natural minor]]. Other examples of scales are the [[octatonic scale]] and the [[pentatonic]] or five-tone scale, which is common in [[folk music]] and [[blues]]. Non-Western cultures often use scales that do not correspond with an equally divided twelve-tone division of the octave. For example, classical [[Ottoman classical music|Ottoman]], [[Persian classical music|Persian]], [[Indian classical music|Indian]] and [[Arabic music|Arabic]] musical systems often make use of multiples of quarter tones (half the size of a semitone, as the name indicates), for instance in 'neutral' seconds (three quarter tones) or 'neutral' thirds (seven quarter tones)—they do not normally use the quarter tone itself as a direct interval.{{sfn|Touma|1996|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}

In traditional Western notation, the scale used for a composition is usually indicated by a [[key signature]] at the beginning to designate the pitches that make up that scale. As the music progresses, the pitches used may change and introduce a different scale. Music can be [[Transposition (music)|transposed]] from one scale to another for various purposes, often to accommodate the range of a vocalist. Such transposition raises or lowers the overall pitch range, but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale. For example, transposition from the key of C major to D major raises all pitches of the scale of C major equally by a [[whole tone]]. Since the interval relationships remain unchanged, transposition may be unnoticed by a listener, however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes the relationship of the overall pitch [[range (music)|range]] compared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music. This often affects the music's overall sound, as well as having technical implications for the performers.{{sfn|Forsyth|1935|loc=73–74}}

The interrelationship of the keys most commonly used in Western tonal music is conveniently shown by the [[circle of fifths]]. Unique key signatures are also sometimes devised for a particular composition. During the Baroque period, emotional associations with specific keys, known as the [[doctrine of the affections]], were an important topic in music theory, but the unique tonal colorings of keys that gave rise to that doctrine were largely erased with the adoption of equal temperament. However, many musicians continue to feel that certain keys are more appropriate to certain emotions than others. [[Indian classical music]] theory continues to strongly associate keys with emotional states, times of day, and other extra-musical concepts and notably, does not employ equal temperament.

===Consonance and dissonance===
{{Main article|Consonance and dissonance}}
{{double image|right|Perfect octave on C.png|175|Minor second on C.png|175|The [[perfect octave]], a consonant interval {{audio|Perfect octave on C.mid|Play}}|The [[minor second]], a dissonant interval {{audio|Minor second on C.mid|Play}}|A consonance|A dissonance}}
[[Consonance and dissonance]] are subjective qualities of the sonority of intervals that vary widely in different cultures and over the ages.
Consonance (or concord) is the quality of an interval or chord that seems stable and complete in itself. Dissonance (or discord) is the opposite in that it feels incomplete and "wants to" resolve to a consonant interval. Dissonant intervals seem to clash. Consonant intervals seem to sound comfortable together. Commonly, perfect fourths, fifths, and octaves and all major and minor thirds and sixths are considered consonant. All others are dissonant to greater or lesser degree.{{sfn|Latham|2002|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}

Context and many other aspects can affect apparent dissonance and consonance. For example, in a Debussy prelude, a major second may sound stable and consonant, while the same interval may sound dissonant in a Bach fugue. In the Common Practice era, the perfect fourth is considered dissonant when not supported by a lower third or fifth. Since the early 20th century, [[Arnold Schoenberg]]’s concept of "emancipated" dissonance, in which traditionally dissonant intervals can be treated as "higher," more remote consonances, has become more widely accepted.{{sfn|Latham|2002|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;!--Better would be the title of the article in this dictionary, added to the entry in the list of references, in which case a page number would be superfluous.--&gt;}}

===Rhythm===
{{Main article|Rhythm}}
[[File:Metric levels.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Metric level]]s: beat level shown in middle with division levels above and multiple levels below.]]
Rhythm is produced by the sequential arrangement of sounds and silences in time. [[Metre (music)|Meter]] measures music in regular pulse groupings, called [[Bar (music)|measures or bars]]. The [[time signature]] or meter signature specifies how many beats are in a measure, and which value of written note is counted or felt as a single beat.

Through increased stress, or variations in duration or articulation, particular tones may be accented. There are conventions in most musical traditions for regular and hierarchical accentuation of beats to reinforce a given meter. [[Syncopation|Syncopated]] rhythms contradict those conventions by accenting unexpected parts of the beat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syncopation|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t237/e10023|website=Oxford Dictionary of Music|accessdate=11 August 2017|quote="Syncopation is achieved by accenting a weak instead of a strong beat, by putting rests on strong beats, by holding on over strong beats, and by introducing a sudden change of time‐signature."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing simultaneous rhythms in more than one time signature is called [[polyrhythm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polyrhythm|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/22059|website=Grove Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=11 August 2017|quote="The superposition of different rhythms or metres."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, rhythm and meter have become an important area of research among music scholars. The most highly cited of these recent scholars are [[Maury Yeston]],{{sfn|Yeston|1976}} [[Fred Lerdahl]] and [[Ray Jackendoff]],{{sfn|Lerdahl and Jackendoff|1985}} [[Jonathan Kramer]],{{sfn|Kramer|1988}}  and [[Justin London]].{{sfn|London|2004}}

A [[melody]] is a series of tones sounding in succession that typically move toward a climax of tension then resolve to a state of rest. Because melody is such a prominent aspect in so much music, its construction and other qualities are a primary interest of music theory.

The basic elements of melody are pitch, duration, rhythm, and tempo. The tones of a melody are usually drawn from pitch systems such as [[Musical scale|scales]] or [[Musical mode|modes]]. Melody may consist, to increasing degree, of the figure, motive, semi-phrase, antecedent and consequent phrase, and period or sentence. The period may be considered the complete melody, however some examples combine two periods, or use other combinations of constituents to create larger form melodies.{{sfn|Stein|1979|loc=3–47}}

===Chord===

A chord, in [[music]], is any [[harmony|harmonic]] set of three or more [[Musical note|note]]s that is heard as if sounding [[Simultaneity (music)|simultaneously]].{{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|loc=67, 359|quote=A ''chord'' is a harmonic unit with at least three different tones sounding simultaneously." "A combination of three or more pitches sounding at the same time.}}{{sfn|Károlyi|1965|loc=63|quote=Two or more notes sounding simultaneously are known as a ''chord''.}} These need not actually be played together: [[arpeggio]]s and broken chords may, for many practical and theoretical purposes, constitute chords. Chords and [[Chord progression|sequences of chords]] are frequently used in modern Western, West African,{{sfn|Mitchell|2008}} and Oceanian{{sfn|Linkels|n.d.|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Specific page citation within this twelve-page article needed.--&gt;}} music, whereas they are absent from the music of many other parts of the world.{{sfn|Malm|1996|loc=15|quote=Indeed this harmonic orientation is one of the major differences between Western and much non-Western music.}}

The most frequently encountered chords are [[Triad (music)|triads]], so called because they consist of three distinct notes: further notes may be added to give [[seventh chord]]s, [[extended chord]]s, or [[added tone chord]]s. The most [[Common chord (music)|common chord]]s are the ''[[major chord|major]]'' and ''[[minor chord|minor]] [[Triad (music)|triads]]'' and then the ''[[augmented triad|augmented]]'' and ''[[diminished triad|diminished]] [[Triad (music)|triads]]''. The descriptions ''major'', ''minor'', ''augmented'', and ''diminished'' are sometimes referred to collectively as chordal ''quality''. Chords are also commonly classed by their [[root (chord)|root]] note—so, for instance, the chord '''C''' major may be described as a triad of major quality built on the note '''C'''. Chords may also be classified by [[Inverted chord|inversion]], the order in which the notes are stacked.

A series of chords is called a [[chord progression]]. Although any chord may in principle be followed by any other chord, certain patterns of chords have been accepted as establishing [[Key (music)|key]] in [[Common practice harmony|common-practice harmony]]. To describe this, chords are numbered, using [[Roman numerals]] (upward from the key-note),{{sfn|Schoenberg|1983|loc=1–2}} per their [[diatonic function]]. Common ways of [[#Notation|notating or representing chords]]{{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|loc=77}} in western music other than conventional [[staff notation]] include [[Roman numerals#Music theory|Roman numerals]], [[figured bass]] (much used in the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]]), [[Macro analysis|macro symbols]] (sometimes used in modern [[musicology]]), and various systems of [[chord chart]]s typically found in the [[lead sheet]]s used in [[Chord names and symbols (popular music)|popular music]] to lay out the sequence of chords so that the musician may play accompaniment chords or improvise a solo.

===Harmony===

In [[music]], harmony is the use of simultaneous [[pitch (music)|pitches]] ([[timbre|tones]], [[note (music)|notes]]), or [[chord (music)|chords]].{{sfn|Malm|1996|loc=15|quote=Homophonic texture...is more common in Western music, where tunes are often built on chords (harmonies) that move in progressions. Indeed this harmonic orientation is one of the major differences between Western and much non-Western music.}} The study of harmony involves chords and their construction and [[chord progression]]s and the principles of connection that govern them.{{sfn|Dahlhaus|2009}} Harmony is often said to refer to the "vertical" aspect of music, as distinguished from [[melody|melodic line]], or the "horizontal" aspect.{{sfn|Jamini|2005|loc=147}} [[Counterpoint]], which refers to the interweaving of melodic lines, and [[polyphony]], which refers to the relationship of separate independent voices, are thus sometimes distinguished from harmony.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In [[popular harmony|popular]] and [[jazz harmony]], chords are named by their [[root (chord)|root]] plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities. For example, a [[lead sheet]] may indicate chords such as C major, D minor, and G dominant seventh. In many types of music, notably Baroque, Romantic, modern, and jazz, chords are often augmented with "tensions". A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant interval]] in relation to the bass. Typically, in the classical [[common practice period]] a dissonant chord (chord with tension) "resolves" to a consonant chord. [[Harmonization]] usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds. In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between "tense" and "relaxed" moments.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Timbre===
{{Main article|Timbre}}
[[File:9577 Guitarz1970 Clean E9 Guitar Chord (Mike Tribulas).jpg|thumb|right|[[Spectrogram]] of the first second of an E9 chord played on a Fender Stratocaster guitar with noiseless pickups. Below is the E9 chord audio:
[[File:9577 Guitarz1970 Clean E9 Guitar Chord (Mike Tribulas).ogg]] ]]Timbre, sometimes called "color", or "tone color," is the principal phenomenon that allows us to distinguish one instrument from another when both play at the same pitch and volume, a quality of a voice or instrument often described in terms like bright, dull, shrill, etc. It is of considerable interest in music theory, especially because it is one component of music that has as yet, no standardized nomenclature. It has been called "...the psychoacoustician's multidimensional waste-basket category for everything that cannot be labeled pitch or loudness,"{{sfn|McAdams and Bregman|1979|loc=34}} but can be accurately described and analyzed by [[Fourier analysis]] and other methods{{sfn|Mannell|n.d.}} because it results from the combination of all sound [[Audio frequency|frequencies]], attack and release envelopes, and other qualities that a tone comprises.

[[Timbre]] is principally determined by two things: (1) the relative balance of [[overtones]] produced by a given instrument due its construction (e.g. shape, material), and (2) the [[Envelope (waves)|envelope]] of the sound (including changes in the overtone structure over time). Timbre varies widely between different instruments, voices, and to lesser degree, between instruments of the same type due to variations in their construction, and significantly, the performer's technique. The timbre of most instruments can be changed by employing different techniques while playing. For example, the timbre of a trumpet changes when a mute is inserted into the bell, the player changes their embouchure, or volume.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

A voice can change its timbre by the way the performer manipulates their vocal apparatus, (e.g. the shape of the vocal cavity or mouth). Musical notation frequently specifies alteration in timbre by changes in sounding technique, volume, accent, and other means. These are indicated variously by symbolic and verbal instruction. For example, the word ''dolce'' (sweetly) indicates a non-specific, but commonly understood soft and "sweet" timbre. ''Sul tasto'' instructs a string player to bow near or over the fingerboard to produce a less brilliant sound. ''Cuivre'' instructs a brass player to produce a forced and stridently brassy sound. Accent symbols like ''marcato'' (^) and dynamic indications (''pp'') can also indicate changes in timbre.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

====Dynamics====
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
{{Relevance inline|section|date=September 2015|reason=What has this entire section to do with theory?}}
{{Main article|Dynamics (music)}}
[[File:Music hairpins.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|An illustration of hairpins in musical notation.]]
In music, "[[dynamics (music)|dynamics]]" normally refers to variations of intensity or volume, as may be measured by physicists and audio engineers in [[decibels]] or [[phon]]s. In music notation, however, dynamics are not treated as absolute values, but as relative ones. Because they are usually measured subjectively, there are factors besides amplitude that affect the performance or perception of intensity, such as timbre, vibrato, and articulation.

The conventional indications of dynamics are abbreviations for Italian words like ''forte'' ('''''f''''') for loud and ''piano'' ('''''p''''') for soft. These two basic notations are modified by indications including ''mezzo piano'' ('''''mp''''') for moderately soft (literally "half soft") and ''mezzo forte'' ('''''mf''''') for moderately loud, ''sforzando'' or ''sforzato'' ('''''sfz''''') for a surging or "pushed" attack, or ''fortepiano'' ('''''fp''''') for a loud attack with a sudden decrease to a soft level. The full span of these markings usually range from a nearly inaudible ''pianissississimo'' ('''''pppp''''') to a loud-as-possible ''fortissississimo'' ('''''ffff''''').

Greater extremes of '''''pppppp''''' and '''''fffff''''' and nuances such as '''''p+''''' or ''più piano'' are sometimes found. Other systems of indicating volume are also used in both notation and analysis: dB (decibels), numerical scales, colored or different sized notes, words in languages other than Italian, and symbols such as those for progressively increasing volume (''crescendo'') or decreasing volume (''decrescendo''), often called "[[Dynamics (music)|hairpins]]" when indicated with diverging or converging lines as shown in the graphic above.

====Articulation====
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
{{Main article|Articulation (music)}}
[[File:Notation accents1.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Examples of articulation marks. From left to right: [[staccato]], [[staccatissimo]], [[martellato]], [[marcato]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;!--The linked article says there are two symbols commonly used to indicate "marcato": the one so indicated here, and the one that is here described as "martellato". Which authority says the latter is incorrect?--&gt; [[tenuto]].]]
Articulation is the way the performer sounds notes. For example, ''[[staccato]]'' is the shortening of duration compared to the written note value, ''[[legato]]'' performs the notes in a smoothly joined sequence with no separation. Articulation is often described rather than quantified, therefore there is room to interpret how to execute precisely each articulation.

For example, ''staccato'' is often referred to as "separated" or "detached" rather than having a defined or numbered amount by which to reduce the notated duration. Violin players use a variety of techniques to perform different qualities of ''staccato.'' The manner in which a performer decides to execute a given articulation is usually based on the context of the piece or phrase, but many articulation symbols and verbal instructions depend on the instrument and musical period (e.g. viol, wind; classical, baroque; etc.).

There are a set of articulations that most instruments and voices perform in common. They are—from long to short: ''legato'' (smooth, connected); ''[[tenuto]]'' (pressed or played to full notated duration); ''[[marcato]]'' (accented and detached); ''staccato'' ("separated", "detached"); ''[[martelé (bowstroke)|martelé]]'' (heavily accented or "hammered"). Many of these can be combined to create certain "in-between" articulations. For example, ''[[portato]]'' is the combination of ''tenuto'' and ''staccato''. Some instruments have unique methods by which to produce sounds, such as ''[[spicatto]]'' for bowed strings, where the bow bounces off the string.

===Texture===
{{Main article|Musical texture}}
[[File:Sousa - "Washington Post March," m. 1-7.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Introduction to [[John Philip Sousa|Sousa]]'s "[[The Washington Post (march)|Washington Post March]]," mm. 1–7{{audio|Sousa - "Washington Post March," m. 1-7.mid|Play}} features [[octave doubling]] {{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|p=133}} and a homorhythmic texture.]]
In [[music]], texture is how the [[melody|melodic]], [[rhythm]]ic, and [[harmony|harmonic]] materials are combined in a [[musical composition|composition]], thus determining the overall quality of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and [[range (music)|range]], or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices. For example, a thick texture contains many "layers" of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass.

The thickness also is affected by the amount and the richness of the instruments playing the piece. The thickness varies from light to thick. A lightly textured piece will have light, sparse scoring. A thickly or heavily textured piece will be scored for many instruments. A piece's texture may be affected by the number and character of parts playing at once, the [[timbre]] of the instruments or voices playing these parts and the harmony, [[tempo]], and rhythms used.{{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} The types categorized by number and relationship of parts are analyzed and determined through the labeling of primary textural elements: primary melody, secondary melody, parallel supporting melody, static support, harmonic support, rhythmic support, and harmonic and rhythmic support.{{sfn|Isaac and Russell|2003|loc=136}}

Common types included [[monophonic]] texture (a single melodic voice, such as a piece for solo soprano or solo flute), biphonic texture (two melodic voices, such as a duo for bassoon and flute in which the bassoon plays a drone note and the flute plays the melody), [[polyphonic]] texture and [[homophonic]] texture (chords accompanying a melody).{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;!--Especially for the drone accompaniment, which is usually regarded as a type of monophony.--&gt;

===Form or structure===

{{Main article|Musical form}}
The term musical form (or musical architecture) refers to the overall structure or plan of a piece of music, and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections.{{sfn|Brandt|2007}} In the tenth edition of ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]'', [[Percy Scholes]] defines musical form as "a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration."{{sfn|Scholes|1977}} According to [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]], musical form is "the shape or structure of the work." He describes it through difference: the distance moved from a [[Repetition (music)|repeat]]; the latter being the smallest difference. Difference is quantitative and qualitative: ''how far'', and ''of what type'', different. In many cases, form depends on statement and [[Restatement (music)|restatement]], unity and variety, and [[contrast (music)|contrast]] and connection.{{sfn|Middleton|1999|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}}

===Expression===
{{Main article|Musical expression}}
[[File:1Francisco20violinista.jpg|thumb|Right|220px|A violinist performing]]
Musical expression is the art of playing or singing music with emotional communication. The elements of music that comprise expression include dynamic indications, such as forte or piano, [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], differing qualities of timbre and articulation, color, intensity, energy and excitement. All of these devices can be incorporated by the performer. A performer aims to elicit responses of sympathetic feeling in the audience, and to excite, calm or otherwise sway the audience's physical and emotional responses. Musical expression is sometimes thought to be produced by a combination of other parameters, and sometimes described as a transcendent quality that is more than the sum of measurable quantities such as pitch or duration.

Expression on instruments can be closely related to the role of the breath in singing, and the voice's natural ability to express feelings, sentiment and deep emotions.{{clarify|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Does this mean that keyboard and stringed instruments are essentially inexpressive?--&gt; Whether these can somehow be categorized is perhaps the realm of academics, who view expression as an element of musical performance that embodies a consistently recognizable [[emotion]], ideally causing a [[emotional contagion|sympathetic emotional response]] in its listeners.{{sfn|London|n.d.}} The emotional content of musical expression is distinct from the emotional content of specific sounds (e.g., a startlingly-loud 'bang') and of learned associations (e.g., a [[national anthem]]), but can rarely be completely separated from its context.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The components of musical expression continue to be the subject of extensive and unresolved dispute.{{sfn|Avison|1752|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Where does Avison say there is a continuing and unresolved dispute?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Christiani|1885|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Where does Christiani say there is a continuing and unresolved dispute?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Lussy|1892|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--On what page(s) does Lussy state there is an extensive and unresolved dispute, or indeed that there is any dispute at all?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Darwin|1913|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Where does Darwin state that there is a continuing and unresolved dispute?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Sorantin|1932|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--On what page(s) does Sorantin contend that there is an extensive and unresolved dispute on thesubject?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Davies|1994|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--On what page does Davies say the components of expression continue to be subject to unresolved dispute?

===Notation===
{{Main article|Musical notation|Sheet music}}
[[File:Tibetanmusicalscore.jpg|thumb|[[Tibet]]an musical score from the 19th century]]
Musical notation is the written or symbolized representation of music. This is most often achieved by the use of commonly understood graphic symbols and written verbal instructions and their abbreviations. There are many systems of music notation from different cultures and different ages. Traditional Western notation evolved during the Middle Ages and remains an area of experimentation and innovation.{{Sfnm|Read|1969|1loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}|Stone|1980|2loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}In the 2000s, computer [[file formats]] have become important as well.{{sfn|Castan|2009}} Spoken language and [[Kodály Method#Hand signs|hand signs]] are also used to symbolically represent music, primarily in teaching.

In standard Western music notation, tones are represented graphically by symbols (notes) placed on a [[Staff (music)|staff]] or staves, the vertical axis corresponding to pitch and the horizontal axis corresponding to time. Note head shapes, stems, flags, ties and dots are used to indicate duration. Additional symbols indicate keys, dynamics, accents, rests, etc. Verbal instructions from the [[Conducting|conductor]] are often used to indicate tempo, technique, and other aspects.

In Western music, a range of different music notation systems are used. In Western [[Classical music]], conductors use printed scores that show all of the instruments' parts and orchestra members read parts with their musical lines written out. In popular styles of music, much less of the music may be notated. A rock band may go into a recording session with just a handwritten [[chord chart]] indicating the song's [[chord progression]] using chord names (e.g., C major, D minor, G7, etc.). All of the chord voicings, rhythms and accompaniment figures are improvised by the band members.

==Music theory as academic discipline==
The scholarly study of music theory in the twentieth century has a number of different subfields, each of which takes a different perspective on what are the primary phenomenon of interest and the most useful methods for investigation.

===Analysis===
{{Main article|Musical analysis|Schenkerian analysis|Transformational theory}}
[[File:Debussy Pelleas et Melisande prelude opening.PNG|thumb|upright=1.3|Typically a given work is analyzed by more than one person and different or divergent analyses are created. For instance, the first two bars of the prelude to [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Melisande]]''
are analyzed differently by Leibowitz, Laloy, van Appledorn, and Christ. Leibowitz analyses this succession harmonically as D minor:I-VII-V, ignoring melodic motion, Laloy analyses the succession as D:I-V, seeing the G in the second measure as an [[musical ornamentation|ornament]], and both van Appledorn and Christ analyses the succession as D:I-VII.
{{audio|Debussy Pelleas et Melisande prelude opening.mid|Play}}]]
Musical analysis is the attempt to answer the question ''how does this music work?'' The method employed to answer this question, and indeed exactly what is meant by the question, differs from analyst to analyst, and according to the purpose of the analysis. According to [[Ian Bent]], "analysis, as a pursuit in its own right, came to be established only in the late 19th century; its emergence as an approach and method can be traced back to the 1750s. However, it existed as a scholarly tool, albeit an auxiliary one, from the [[Middle Ages]] onwards."{{sfn|Bent|1987|loc=6}} [[Adolf Bernhard Marx]] was influential in formalising concepts about composition and music understanding towards the second half of the 19th century. The principle of analysis has been variously criticized, especially by composers, such as [[Edgard Varèse]]'s claim that, "to explain by means of [analysis] is to decompose, to mutilate the spirit of a work".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvnb|Bernard|1981|loc=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Schenkerian analysis]] is a method of musical analysis of tonal music based on the theories of [[Heinrich Schenker]] (1868–1935). The goal of a Schenkerian analysis is to interpret the underlying structure of a tonal work and to help reading the score according to that structure. The theory's basic tenets can be viewed as a way of defining [[tonality]] in music. A Schenkerian analysis of a passage of music shows hierarchical relationships among its pitches, and draws conclusions about the structure of the passage from this hierarchy. The analysis makes use of a specialized symbolic form of musical notation that Schenker devised to demonstrate various [[Schenkerian analysis#Techniques of prolongation|techniques of elaboration]]. The most fundamental concept of Schenker's theory of tonality may be that of ''tonal space''.&lt;ref&gt;Schenker described the concept in a paper titled ''Erläuterungen'' ("Elucidations"), which he published four times between 1924 and 1926: ''Der Tonwille'' {{Full citation needed|date=August 2015}} vol. 8–9, pp. 49–51, vol. 10, pp. 40–2; ''Das Meisterwerk in der Musik'', {{Full citation needed|date=August 2015}} vol. 1, pp. 201–05; 2, p. 193-97. English translation, ''Der Tonwille'',{{Full citation needed|date=August 2015}} vol. 2, p. 117-18 (the translation, although made from vols. 8–9 of the German original, gives as original pagination that of ''Das Meisterwerk'' {{Full citation needed|date=August 2015}} 1; the text is the same). The concept of tonal space is still present in {{harvtxt|Schenker|n.d.|loc=especially § 13}}, but less clearly than in the earlier presentation.&lt;/ref&gt; The intervals between the notes of the tonic triad form a ''tonal space'' that is filled with passing and neighbour notes, producing new triads and new tonal spaces, open for further elaborations until the surface of the work (the score) is reached.

Although Schenker himself usually presents his analyses in the generative direction, starting from the [[fundamental structure]] (''Ursatz'') to reach the score, the practice of Schenkerian analysis more often is reductive, starting from the score and showing how it can be reduced to its fundamental structure. The graph of the ''Ursatz'' is arrhythmic, as is a strict-counterpoint cantus firmus exercise.{{sfn|Schenker|n.d.|loc=§ 21{{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} Even at intermediate levels of the reduction, rhythmic notation (open and closed noteheads, beams and flags) shows not rhythm but the hierarchical relationships between the pitch-events. Schenkerian analysis is ''subjective''. There is no mechanical procedure involved and the analysis reflects the musical intuitions of the analyst.{{sfn| Snarrenberg|1997|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} The analysis represents a way of hearing (and reading) a piece of music.

Transformational theory is a branch of music theory developed by [[David Lewin]] in the 1980s, and formally introduced in his 1987 work, ''Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations''. The theory, which models [[Transformation (music)|musical transformations]] as elements of a [[Group theory|mathematical group]], can be used to analyze both [[tonality|tonal]] and [[atonal music]]. The goal of transformational theory is to change the focus from musical objects—such as the "C [[major chord]]" or "G major chord"—to relations between objects. Thus, instead of saying that a C major chord is followed by G major, a transformational theorist might say that the first chord has been "transformed" into the second by the "[[dominant (music)|Dominant]] operation."  (Symbolically, one might write "Dominant(C major) = G major.")  While traditional [[set theory (music)|musical set theory]] focuses on the makeup of musical objects, transformational theory focuses on the [[interval (music)|intervals]] or types of musical motion that can occur. According to Lewin's description of this change in emphasis, "[The transformational] attitude does not ask for some observed measure of extension between reified 'points'; rather it asks: 'If I am ''at'' s and wish to get to t, what characteristic ''gesture'' should I perform in order to arrive there?'"{{sfn|Lewin|1987|loc=159}}

===Music perception and cognition===
[[File:Diana deutsch scale fig3b.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|[[Deutsch's scale illusion]]: an [[auditory illusion]] in which two scales are presented with successive tones alternating between each ear but are perceived as simultaneous, unbroken scales.{{sfn|Bregman|1994|loc=76}}]]
{{Further information|Music psychology|Fred Lerdahl|Ray Jackendoff}}
Music psychology or the psychology of music may be regarded as a branch of both [[psychology]] and [[musicology]]. It aims to explain and understand [[music]]al [[behavior]] and [[experience]], including the processes through which music is perceived, created, responded to, and incorporated into everyday life.{{sfn|Tan, Peter, and Rom|2010|loc=2}}{{sfn|Thompson|n.d.|loc=320}} Modern music psychology is primarily [[Empirical research|empirical]]; its knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic [[observation]] of and interaction with [[Human subject research|human participants]]. Music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas, including music [[musical technique|performance]], [[music composition|composition]], [[music education|education]], [[music criticism|criticism]], and [[music therapy|therapy]], as well as investigations of human [[aptitude]], [[skill]], [[intelligence]], [[creativity]], and [[social behavior]].

Music psychology can shed light on non-psychological aspects of [[musicology]] and musical practice. For example, it contributes to music theory through investigations of the [[perception]] and [[Cognitive musicology|computational modelling]] of musical structures such as [[melody]], [[harmony]], [[tonality]], [[rhythm]], [[Meter (music)|meter]], and [[Musical form|form]]. Research in [[music history]] can benefit from systematic study of the history of [[musical syntax]], or from psychological analyses of composers and compositions in relation to perceptual, affective, and social responses to their music. [[Ethnomusicology]] can benefit from psychological approaches to the study of [[Culture in music cognition|music cognition in different cultures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=QCfUoD4m7E4C&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=Ethnomusicology+can+benefit+from+psychological+approaches+to+the+study+of+music+cognition+in+different+cultures.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=S1ffy-zJ_D&amp;sig=MHHfRNiZSsLSqtelThi5cvmrZnQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiezMnRypXZAhUJSY8KHVgoApcQ6AEISDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Ethnomusicology%20can%20benefit%20from%20psychological%20approaches%20to%20the%20study%20of%20music%20cognition%20in%20different%20cultures.&amp;f=false|title=Time in Indian Music: Rhythm, Metre, and Form in North Indian Rag Performance|last=Martin|first=Clayton|last2=Clayton|first2=Martin|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195339680|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Genre and technique===
{{Main article|Music genre|Musical technique}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F008930-0019, Beethovenhalle Bonn, Kammerkonzert Kölner Trio.jpg|thumb|A Classical [[piano trio]] is a group that plays [[chamber music]], including [[sonata]]s. The term "piano trio" also refers to works composed for such a group.]]
A music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of [[music]] as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions.{{sfn|Samson|n.d.}} It is to be distinguished from ''[[musical form]]'' and ''musical style'', although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.{{sfn|Wong|2011}}{{Failed verification|date=December 2014}}&lt;!--An electronic search of this web article finds only one occurrence of the word "form", as part of the compound expression ; the word "style" does not occur at all. As a result, this citation confirms neither the claim that genre should be distinguished from form and style, nor the claim that they are sometimes used interchangeably in practice.--&gt;

Music can be divided into different [[genres]] in many different ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are even varying academic definitions of the term ''genre ''itself. In his book ''Form in Tonal Music'', Douglass M. Green distinguishes between genre and [[Musical form|form]]. He lists [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], [[motet]], [[canzona]], [[ricercar]], and dance as examples of genres from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period. To further clarify the meaning of ''genre'', Green writes, "Beethoven's Op. 61 and Mendelssohn's Op. 64 are identical in genre—both are violin concertos—but different in form. However, Mozart's Rondo for Piano, K. 511, and the ''Agnus Dei'' from his Mass, K. 317 are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form."{{sfn|Green|1979|loc=1}} Some, like [[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|Peter van der Merwe]], treat the terms ''genre'' and ''style'' as the same, saying that ''genre'' should be defined as pieces of music that came from the same style or "basic musical language."{{sfn|van der Merwe|1989|loc=3}}

Others, such as Allan F. Moore, state that ''genre'' and ''style'' are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres.{{sfn|Moore|2001|loc=432–33}} A music genre or subgenre may also be defined by the [[musical technique]]s, the style, the cultural context, and the content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres. Timothy Laurie argues that "since the early 1980s, genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects".{{sfn|Laurie|2014|loc=284}}

Musical technique is the ability of [[musical instrument|instrumental]] and [[Human voice|vocal]] musicians to exert optimal control of their instruments or [[vocal cords]] to produce precise musical effects. Improving technique generally entails practicing exercises that improve muscular sensitivity and agility. To improve technique, musicians often practice fundamental patterns of notes such as the [[Natural minor|natural]], [[Minor scale|minor]], [[Major scale|major]], and [[chromatic scale]]s, [[Minor triad|minor]] and [[major triad]]s, [[Dominant seventh chord|dominant]] and [[diminished seventh]]s, formula patterns and [[arpeggio]]s. For example, [[Triad (music)|triads]] and [[Seventh chord|sevenths]] teach how to play chords with accuracy and speed. [[Scale (music)|Scales]] teach how to move quickly and gracefully from one note to another (usually by step). Arpeggios teach how to play [[broken chord]]s over larger intervals. Many of these components of music are found in compositions, for example, a scale is a very common element of [[Classical music|classical]] and [[Romantic music|romantic]] era compositions.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

[[Heinrich Schenker]] argued that musical technique's "most striking and distinctive characteristic" is [[repetition (music)|repetition]].{{sfn|Kivy|1993|loc=327}} Works known as [[étude]]s (meaning "study") are also frequently used for the improvement of technique.

===Mathematics===
{{Main article|Music and mathematics}}
[[Music]] theorists sometimes use [[mathematics]] to understand music, and although music has no [[axiomatic]] foundation in modern mathematics, mathematics is "the basis of sound" and sound itself "in its musical aspects... exhibits a remarkable array of number properties", simply because nature itself "is amazingly mathematical".{{sfn|Smith Brindle|1987|loc=42–43}} The attempt to structure and communicate new ways of composing and hearing music has led to musical applications of [[set theory]], [[abstract algebra]] and [[number theory]]. Some composers have incorporated the [[golden ratio]] and [[Fibonacci numbers]] into their work.{{sfn|Smith Brindle|1987|loc=chapter 6, ''passim''}}{{sfn|Garland and Kahn|1995|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} There is a long history of examining the relationships between music and mathematics. Though ancient Chinese, Egyptians and Mesopotamians are known to have studied the mathematical principles of sound,{{sfn|Smith Brindle|1987|loc=42}} the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] (in particular [[Philolaus]] and [[Archytas]]){{sfn|Purwins|2005|loc=22–24}} of ancient Greece were the first researchers known to have investigated the expression of [[musical scale]]s in terms of numerical [[ratio]]s.
[[File:HarmonicIdentities.Names.Frequencies.svg|thumb|right|400px|The first 16 harmonics, their names and frequencies, showing the exponential nature of the octave and the simple fractional nature of non-octave harmonics.]]
In the modern era, musical [[set theory]] uses the language of mathematical set theory in an elementary way to organize musical objects and describe their relationships. To analyze the structure of a piece of (typically atonal) music using musical set theory, one usually starts with a set of tones, which could form motives or chords. By applying simple operations such as [[transposition (music)|transposition]] and [[Melodic inversion|inversion]], one can discover deep structures in the music. Operations such as transposition and inversion are called [[isometries]] because they preserve the intervals between tones in a set. Expanding on the methods of musical set theory, some theorists have used abstract algebra to analyze music. For example, the pitch classes in an equally tempered octave form an [[abelian group]] with 12 elements. It is possible to describe [[just intonation]] in terms of a [[free abelian group]].{{sfn|Wohl|2005}}

===Serial composition and set theory===
[[File:Berg's Lyric Suite Mov. I tone row B-P.PNG|thumb|Tone row from [[Alban Berg]]'s ''[[Lyric Suite (Berg)|Lyric Suite]]'', mov. I. {{audio|Berg's Lyric Suite Mov. I tone row B-P.mid|Play}}]]
{{Further information|serialism|set theory (music)|Arnold Schoenberg|Milton Babbitt|David Lewin|Allen Forte}}
In music theory, serialism is a method or technique of [[Musical composition|composition]] that uses a series of values to manipulate different [[aspect of music|musical elements]]. Serialism began primarily with [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[twelve-tone technique]], though his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as one example of [[atonality|post-tonal]] thinking. Twelve-tone technique orders the twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]], forming a [[tone row|row]] or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition's [[melody]], [[harmony]], structural progressions, and [[variation (music)|variations]]. Other types of serialism also work with [[set (music)|sets]], collections of objects, but not necessarily with fixed-order series, and extend the technique to other musical dimensions (often called "[[parameter (music)|parameters]]"), such as [[duration (music)|duration]], [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]], and [[timbre]]. The idea of serialism is also applied in various ways in the [[visual arts]], [[design]], and [[architecture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bandur|2001|loc=5, 12, 74}}; {{harvnb|Gerstner|1964|loc=passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Integral serialism" or "total serialism" is the use of series for aspects such as duration, dynamics, and register as well as pitch. {{sfn|Whittall|2008|loc=273}} Other terms, used especially in Europe to distinguish post–World War II serial music from twelve-tone music and its American extensions, are "general serialism" and "multiple serialism".{{sfn|Grant|2001|loc=5–6}}

Musical set theory provides concepts for categorizing musical objects and describing their relationships. Many of the notions were first elaborated by [[Howard Hanson]] (1960) in connection with tonal music, and then mostly developed in connection with atonal music by theorists such as [[Allen Forte]] (1973), drawing on the work in twelve-tone theory of Milton Babbitt. The concepts of set theory are very general and can be applied to tonal and atonal styles in any equally tempered tuning system, and to some extent more generally than that.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

One branch of musical set theory deals with collections (sets and permutations) of pitches and pitch classes (pitch-class set theory), which may be ordered or unordered, and can be related by musical operations such as [[Transposition (music)|transposition]], [[Melodic inversion|inversion]], and [[Complement (music)|complementation]]. The methods of musical set theory are sometimes applied to the analysis of rhythm as well.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Musical semiotics===
{{Further information|music semiology|Jean-Jacques Nattiez}}
[[File:Roman Jakobson.jpg|thumb|upright|Semiotician [[Roman Jakobson]]]]
Music semiology ([[semiotics]]) is the study of signs as they pertain to [[music]] on a variety of levels. Following [[Roman Jakobson]], [[Kofi Agawu]] adopts the idea of musical semiosis being introversive or extroversive—that is, musical signs within a text and without.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} "Topics," or various musical conventions (such as horn calls, dance forms, and styles), have been treated suggestively by Agawu, among others.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} The notion of [[Musical Gestures|gesture]] is beginning to play a large role in musico-semiotic enquiry.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

:"There are strong arguments that music inhabits a semiological realm which, on both [[ontogenetic]] and [[phylogenetic]] levels, has developmental priority over verbal language."{{sfn|Middleton|1990|loc=172}}{{sfn|Nattiez|1976}}{{sfn|Nattiez|1990}}{{sfn|Nattiez1989}}{{sfn|Stefani|1973}}{{sfn|Stefani|1976}}{{sfn|Baroni|1983}}{{sfn|''Semiotica''|1987|loc=66:1–3}}{{clarify |date=November 2018|reason=The quotation cannot stem from all these references at once!}}

Writers on music semiology include Kofi Agawu (on topical theory,{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} [[Heinrich Schenker]],{{sfn|Dunsby and Stopford|1981|loc=49-53}}{{sfn|Meeùs|2017|loc=81-96}} Robert Hatten (on topic, gesture){{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}, [[Raymond Monelle]] (on topic, musical meaning){{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}, [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]] (on introversive taxonomic analysis and ethnomusicological applications){{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}, [[Anthony Newcomb]] (on narrativity){{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}, and [[Eero Tarasti]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} (generally considered the founder of musical semiotics).

[[Roland Barthes]], himself a semiotician and skilled [[amateur]] pianist, wrote about music in ''Image-Music-Text,''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} ''The Responsibilities of Form,''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} and ''Eiffel Tower,''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} though he did not consider music to be a semiotic system{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}.

Signs, meanings in music, happen essentially through the connotations of sounds, and through the social construction, appropriation and amplification of certain meanings associated with these connotations. The work of [[Philip Tagg]] (''Ten Little Tunes'',{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} ''Fernando the Flute'',{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} ''Music’s Meanings''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}}) provides one of the most complete and systematic analysis of the relation between musical structures and connotations in western and especially popular, television and film music. The work of [[Leonard Meyer]] in ''Style and Music''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} theorizes the relationship between ideologies and musical structures and the phenomena of style change, and focuses on romanticism as a case study.

===Education and careers===
[[File:Pat Carpenter picture.JPG|thumb|[[Columbia University]] music theorist Pat Carpenter in a 2013 photo]]
Music theory in the practical sense has been a part of education at conservatories and music schools for centuries, but the status music theory currently has within academic institutions is relatively recent. In the 1970s, few universities had dedicated music theory programs, many music theorists had been trained as composers or historians, and there was a belief among theorists that the teaching of music theory was inadequate and that the subject was not properly recognised as a scholarly discipline in its own right.&lt;ref name=GroveSMT&gt;{{cite web|last=McCreless|first=Patrick|title=Society for Music Theory|work=[[Grove Music Online]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing number of scholars began promoting the idea that music theory should be taught by theorists, rather than composers, performers or music historians.&lt;ref name=GroveSMT/&gt; This led to the founding of the [[Society for Music Theory]] in the United States in 1977. In Europe, the French ''[http://www.sfam.org Société d'Analyse musicale]'' was founded in 1985. It called the First European Conference of Music Analysis for 1989, which resulted in the foundation of the ''[http://www.sbam.be/index.html Société belge d'Analyse musicale]'' in Belgium and the ''[http://www.gatm.it Gruppo analisi e teoria musicale]'' in Italy the same year, the ''[http://www.sma.ac.uk Society for Music Analysis]'' in the UK in 1991, the ''[http://verenigingvoormuziektheorie.net Vereniging voor Muziektheorie]'' in the Netherlands in 1999 and the ''[http://www.gmth.de/home.aspx Gesellschaft für Musiktheorie]'' in Germany in 2000.{{sfn|Meeùs|2015|loc=111}} They were later followed by the [http://eng.otmroo.ru Russian Society for Music Theory] in 2013 and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20180328133232/http://ptam.org.pl/ Polish Society for Music Analysis] in 2015, and others are in construction. These societies coordinate the publication of music theory scholarship and support the professional development of music theory researchers.

As part of their initial training, music theorists will typically complete a [[B.Mus]] or a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in music (or a related field) and in many cases an M.A. in music theory. Some individuals apply directly from a bachelor's degree to a Ph.D, and in these cases, they may not receive an M.A. In the 2010s, given the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of university graduate programs, some applicants for music theory Ph.D programs may have academic training both in music and outside of music (e.g., a student may apply with a B.Mus and a Masters in Music Composition or Philosophy of Music).

Most music theorists work as instructors, lecturers or professors in [[college]]s, [[University|universities]] or [[Music school|conservatories]]. The job market for tenure-track professor positions is very competitive.{{Vague|date=August 2015}}&lt;!--How competitive is "very"? As competitive as for, say, a position as an airline pilot?--&gt; Applicants must hold a completed Ph.D or the equivalent degree (or expect to receive one within a year of being hired—called an "ABD", for "[[All But Dissertation]]" stage) and (for more senior positions) have a strong record of publishing in peer-reviewed journals. Some Ph.D-holding music theorists are only able to find insecure positions as [[sessional lecturer]]s. The job tasks of a music theorist are the same as those of a professor in any other humanities discipline: teaching undergraduate and/or graduate classes in this area of specialization and, in many cases some general courses (such as [[Music appreciation|Music Appreciation]] or Introduction to Music Theory), conducting research in this area of expertise, publishing research articles in peer-reviewed journals, authoring book chapters, books or textbooks, traveling to conferences to present papers and learn about research in the field, and, if the program includes a [[graduate school]], supervising M.A. and Ph.D students and giving them guidance on the preparation of their theses and dissertations. Some music theory professors may take on senior administrative positions in their institution, such as [[Dean (education)|Dean]] or [[Chairman|Chair]] of the School of Music.

The Institute network has four  organization: SE “Research farm “Nyvka” (Kiev), SE “Research farm of Lviv research station of the Institute of Fisheries” (Lviv region), Lviv research station (Lviv region) and Zakarpattya scientific-research station of salmonid culture and conservation of endangered fishes (Zakarpattia region).

== International cooperation ==
Institute scientists cooperate with more than thirty scientific institutions in 17 countries of Europe, Asia, and America. The main line is to solve the problems of aquatic bioresources and [[aquaculture]]. Internship programs for young scientists and training in new methods and techniques of research, selection, molecular-genetic and biochemical studies are developed with research institutions of Poland, Hungary, USA, Russian Federation and Belarus.

In 1997, the institute was the initiator for creating the International Council of scientific and technical cooperation in the field of aquatic bioresources of inland water bodies, which included 16 scientific institutions of Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Russian Federation, Poland, Hungary and Ukraine. The cooperation worked as bilateral and multilateral studies in the field of selection in aquaculture, conservation and restoration of valuable and endangered fish species, development of resource saving technologies of fish rearing, fisheries exploitation of reservoirs and cooling water bodies of energetic systems, fish feeding, prevention of fish diseases, etc.

In 2004, the International Council was transformed into the Network of Aquaculture Centers in Central-Eastern Europe (NACEE), the main mandate of which was to coordinate research and development works in the field of aquatic bioresources and aquaculture in this region. The Institute of Fisheries is an associate contractor on research topics including carp selection, sturgeon culture and conservation of aquatic bioresources. The Institute participates in the project “Technological platform of aquaculture development in Central and Eastern Europe with the possibility of further integration into a common European scientific space”. The Institute is also a member of the European Aquaculture Association, with which it cooperates in fishegries science.

== Scientific library ==
The Institute's library is a specialized scientific-subdivision, which carries out bibliographic and library support. The library has a specialized stock of scientific literature on [[aquaculture]], inland fisheries, [[ichthyology]], hydroecology, [[hydrobiology]], general biology, [[zoology]], [[hydrotechnics]] and aquaculture economy. The thorough use of the library stock is facilitated by the reference-bibliographic tool composed of catalogues and file-cabinets. The card variant has alphabetical and systematic catalogues, which include Institute reports, periodic journals, dissertations and dissertation abstracts, articles of the Institute employees (partially). The IRBIS electronic catalogue includes monographs, collections of scientific articles, articles from periodicals and other publications. The scientific library stock is composed of about 50 000 items and contains all types of print publications. The library provides information and library-bibliographic services to scientists, specialists, postgraduate students and students of higher education institutions. Reader services are performed through subscription, in the reading room and through an inter-library exchange system.

== ''Fisheries Science of Ukraine'' ==
The Institute was the founder and publisher of the quarterly scientific journal ''Fisheries Science of Ukraine''. The journal is included in the List of Specialized Publications of Ukraine, which can be used for publishing results of doctoral and candidate’s theses (biological and agricultural sciences). It was approved in 8 July 2009. and re-certified in 2014. Research papers are published in Ukrainian, Russian, or English. The Journal is open for free access by the Main Scientific Library of Ukraine – V.I. Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. The editorial board considers as a priority to include the Journal into international databases. It is represented in databases such as: Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), DOI (The Digital Object Identifier), [[Ulrich's Periodicals Directory]], Open Academic Journals Index (OAJI) eLIBRARY.RU, ROAD – каталог наукових ресурсів відкритого доступу, Google Scholar and [http://usj.org.ua/ «Українські Наукові Журнали»].

The '''National Solar Observatory ''' ('''NSO''') is a [[United States]] public [[research institute]] to advance the knowledge of the [[solar physics|physics]] of the [[Sun]].
NSO studies the Sun both as an [[astronomical object]] and as the dominant external influence on [[Earth]].
NSO is headquartered in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and operated facilities at two locations, at [[Sacramento Peak]] near [[Sunspot, New Mexico|Sunspot]] in [[New Mexico]], and at [[Kitt Peak]] in [[Arizona]] until the end of [[Fiscal_year#United_States|fiscal year]] 2017.
The institute is constructing the 4-meter [[Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope]] in the [[Haleakala Observatory]] on the island of [[Maui]].

NSO provides its observations to the scientific community. It operates facilities, develops advanced instrumentation both in-house and through partnerships, conducts solar research, and carries out educational and public outreach.

== Visiting the observatories ==
The National Solar Observatory HQ is located on the campus of the University of Colorado, Boulder. It also has some staff on [[Sacramento Peak]], where visitors are welcome during the daytime. The observatory lies in [[New Mexico]] at the southern end of [[New Mexico State Road 6563|NM Scenic Byway 6563]], about 18 miles (by car) south of [[Cloudcroft, New Mexico|Cloudcroft]] (on NM 82), and 40 miles southeast (by car) from [[Alamogordo, New Mexico|Alamogordo]] (on NM 70 and 54), in the village of [[Sunspot, New Mexico|Sunspot]] inside of the [[Lincoln National Forest]]. Sunspot is an unincorporated community in the Sacramento Mountains in Otero County.The nearby nighttime observatory,  [[Apache Point Observatory]], is not open to the public.

== Telescopes operated by the observatory ==
=== Sacramento Peak ===
* See [[Sunspot Solar Observatory]] for the telescopes located there
* See [[Apache Point Observatory]] for the telescopes located there

=== Kitt Peak ===
* [[McMath-Pierce Solar Telescope]]
* [[Kitt Peak Solis Telescope]]

=== Global ===
* [[Global Oscillation Network Group]]

== History==
The Sacramento Peak facilities are located in [[Sunspot, New Mexico]]. The site's name was chosen by the late [[James C. Sadler]], (1920–2005), an internationally noted [[meteorologist]] and professor at The [[University of Hawaii]], formerly with the [[United States Air Force]] on assignment during the early inception of the observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |title=The Sacramento Peak Observatory |work=Solar Physics |issue=182 |pages=1-19 |year=1998 |first=J. B.|last=Zirker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Solar eclipse of August 21, 2017]], NSO enlisted the cooperation of various groups in the Citizen CATE (Continental-America Telescopic Eclipse)  experiment to set up more than 60 identical telescopes along the eclipse path, to produce 90 continuous minutes of images, 10 seconds apart, of the Sun's inner [[corona]]. This was to provide a clearer understanding of solar plumes and other transient phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-solar-eclipse-usa-projects/citizen-scientists-will-take-to-the-field-for-u-s-eclipse-idUSKCN1AX100|title=Citizen scientists will take to the field for U.S. eclipse|last=Klotz|first=Irene|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Realism''' was an artistic movement that began in France in the 1850s, after the [[French Revolution of 1848|1848 Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; Realists rejected [[Romanticism]], which had dominated French literature and art since the late 18th century.  Realism revolted against the exotic subject matter and the exaggerated emotionalism and drama of the Romantic movement. Instead, it sought to portray real and typical contemporary people and situations with truth and accuracy, and not avoiding unpleasant or sordid aspects of life. Realist works depicted people of all classes in situations that arise in ordinary life, and often reflected the changes brought by the [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial]] and [[Commercial Revolution]]s. The popularity of such "realistic" works grew with the introduction of [[photography]]—a new visual source that created a desire for people to produce representations which look objectively real.

The Realists depicted everyday subjects and situations in contemporary settings, and attempted to depict individuals of all social classes in a similar manner. Classical idealism and Romantic emotionalism and drama were avoided equally, and often sordid or untidy elements of subjects were not smoothed over or omitted. Social realism emphasizes the depiction of the working class, and treating them with the same seriousness as other classes in art, but realism, as the avoidance of artificiality, in the treatment of human relations and emotions was also an aim of Realism. Treatments of subjects in a heroic or sentimental manner were equally rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Finocchio, Ross. "Nineteenth-Century French Realism". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm online] (October 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Realism as an art movement was led by [[Gustave Courbet]] in France. It spread across Europe and was influential for the rest of the century and beyond, but as it became adopted into the mainstream of painting it becomes less common and useful as a term to define artistic style. After the arrival of [[Impressionism]] and later movements which downgraded the importance of precise illusionistic brushwork, it often came to refer simply to the use of a more traditional and tighter painting style. It has been used for a number of later movements and trends in art, some involving careful illusionistic representation, such as [[Photorealism]], and others the depiction of "realist" subject matter in a social sense, or attempts at both.


== Beginnings in France ==
[[File:Gustave Courbet 010.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Bonjour, Monsieur Courbet]]'', 1854. A Realist painting by [[Gustave Courbet]].]]
The Realist movement began in the mid-19th century as a reaction to [[Romanticism]] and [[History painting]]. In favor of depictions of 'real' life, the Realist painters used common laborers, and ordinary people in ordinary surroundings engaged in real activities as subjects for their works. The chief exponents of Realism were [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Jean-François Millet]], [[Honoré Daumier]], and [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/collection/sfp/noflash/realism/1941_6_1.htm NGA Realism movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714144138/http://www.nga.gov/collection/sfp/noflash/realism/1941_6_1.htm |date=2014-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/realist-movement National Gallery glossary, Realism movement]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://impressionist1877.tripod.com/realism.htm Philosophy of Realism]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jules Bastien-Lepage]] is closely associated with the beginning of ''Naturalism'', an artistic style that emerged from the later phase of the Realist movement and heralded the arrival of [[Impressionism]].&lt;ref name=Fry&gt;Fry, Roger. 1920. "Vision and Design." London: Chatto &amp; Windus. "An Essay in Æsthetics." 11-24. Accessed online on 13 March 2012 at {{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/52044301/Roger-Fry-Vision-and-design |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114154844/http://www.scribd.com/doc/52044301/Roger-Fry-Vision-and-design |archivedate=2013-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Realists used unprettified detail depicting the existence of ordinary contemporary life, coinciding in the contemporaneous naturalist literature of [[Émile Zola]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], and [[Gustave Flaubert]].&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm Nineteenth-Century French Realism | Essay | Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Courbet was the leading proponent of Realism and he challenged the popular [[history painting]] that was favored at the state-sponsored art academy.
His groundbreaking paintings ''[[A Burial at Ornans]]'' and ''[[The Stonebreakers]]'' depicted ordinary people from his native region. Both paintings were done on huge canvases that would typically be used for history paintings.&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"/&gt; Although Courbet's early works emulated the sophisticated manner of Old Masters such as [[Rembrandt]] and [[Titian]], after 1848 he adopted a boldly inelegant style inspired by [[popular print]]s, shop signs, and other work of folk artisans.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt; In ''The Stonebreakers'', his first painting to create a controversy, Courbet eschewed the pastoral tradition of representing human subjects in harmony with nature. Rather, he depicted two men juxtaposed against a charmless, stony roadside. The concealment of their faces emphasizes the dehumanizing nature of their monotonous, repetitive labor.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt;

The French Realist movement had stylistic and ideological equivalents in all other Western countries, developing somewhat later. The Realist movement in France was characterized by a spirit of rebellion against powerful official support for history painting. In countries where institutional support of history painting was less dominant, the transition from existing traditions of [[genre art|genre painting]] to Realism presented no such schism.&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;Rubin, J. 2003. "Realism". ''Grove Art Online''.&lt;/ref&gt; An important Realist movement beyond France was the [[Peredvizhniki]] or ''Wanderers'' group in Russia who formed in the 1860s and organized exhibitions from 1871 included many realists such as genre artist [[Vasily Perov]], [[landscape art|landscape]] artists [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Alexei Savrasov]], and [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]], portraitist [[Ivan Kramskoy]], [[war artist]] [[Vasily Vereshchagin]], historical artist [[Vasily Surikov]] and, especially, [[Ilya Repin]], who is considered by many to be the most renowned Russian artist of the 19th century. 

Courbet's influence was felt most strongly in Germany, where prominent realists included [[Adolph Menzel]], [[Wilhelm Leibl]], [[Wilhelm Trübner]], and [[Max Liebermann]]. Leibl and several other young German painters met Courbet in 1869 when he visited Munich to exhibit his works and demonstrate his manner of painting from nature.&lt;ref&gt;Nationalgalerie (Berlin), and Françoise Forster-Hahn. 2001. ''Spirit of an Age: Nineteenth-Century Paintings From the Nationalgalerie, Berlin''. London: National Gallery Company. p. 155. {{ISBN|1857099605}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy the artists of the [[Macchiaioli]] group painted Realist scenes of rural and urban life. The [[Hague School]] were Realists in the Netherlands whose style and subject matter strongly influenced the early works of [[Vincent van Gogh]].&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt; In Britain artists such as the American [[James Abbot McNeill Whistler]], as well as English artists [[Ford Madox Brown]], [[Hubert von Herkomer]] and [[Luke Fildes]] had great success with realist paintings dealing with social issues and depictions of the "real" world. 

In the United States, [[Winslow Homer]] and [[Thomas Eakins]] were important Realists and forerunners of the [[Ashcan School]], an early-20th-century art movement largely based in [[New York City]]. The Ashcan School included such artists as [[George Bellows]] and [[Robert Henri]], and helped to define [[American realism]] in its tendency to depict the daily life of poorer members of society.

The '''social construction of disability''' is the idea that society and its institutions have the power to construct disability around social expectations of health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea argues that disability is construction based on several localized social expectations. For example, in the medieval period disability was constructed around a person's moral behavior. Disability was seen as divine punishment or a side effect of a moral failing being physically or biologically different was not enough to be considered disabled. Only until the European Enlightenment did society change its definition of disability to be more related to biology. However these biological definitions of health centered around what is considered to be healthy for most Western Europeans.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book

==History==
Around the year 1970, in North America various groups including sociologists, disabled people, and disabled focused political groups began to pull away from the accepted medical lens of viewing disability. These groups began to discuss things like oppression, civil rights, and accessibility. This change in discourse resulted in conceptualizations of disability that was rooted in social constructions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Overview===
Canada and the United States have operated under the premise that social assistance benefits should not exceed the amount of money that can be earned through labor in order to give citizens an incentive to search for and maintain employment. This has led to widespread poverty amongst disabled citizens. In the 1950s, disability pensions were established and included various forms of direct economic assistance; however, these amounts were set at exceedingly low monetary levels. Since the 1970s, both governments have viewed unemployed disabled citizens as excess labor due to continuous high rates of unemployment and have made minimal attempts to increase employment, which keeps disabled people at poverty- level incomes due to the ‘incentive’ principle. Poverty is the most debilitating circumstance handicapped people face, resulting in the inability to afford proper medical, technological and other assistance necessary to participate in society.&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite book|last=Wendell|first=Wendell|title=The Social Construction of Disability|publisher=Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group|year=1996 |pages=60|url=http://moodle.fhs.cuni.cz/pluginfile.php/19118/mod_resource/content/0/Wendell_Social_construction.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laws and public policy===
Laws have helped to recognize disability as a social construct rather than simply physical impairment. In 1776, the Continental Congress passed the first national law regarding wounded soldiers. Rather than stating attitudes towards disability, the act proposed that how the US viewed disability was closely linked to its views about the worth of the soldiers. This segment of the Act contains a few inferences which relate to disability:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whereas, in the course of the present war, some commissioned and non-commissioned officers of the army and navy, as also private soldiers, marines, and seamen, may lose a limb, or be otherwise so disabled as to prevent their serving in the army or navy, or getting their livelihood, and may stand in need of relief[.]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Liachowitz|first=Claire|title=Disability as a Social Construct|year=1988|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|pages=22–23|isbn=0-8122-8134-9}}

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although this resolution related disability to “getting a livelihood,” it also implies through the recognition of an additional connection to serving in the military that disability is not just a failure to function properly but rather built systemically through the ability to function in certain settings. Also, this resolution states that disability is not only based upon physical capabilities and societal roles but social aspects as well.

The [[Americans With Disabilities Act]] (ADA) is a prime example of how laws have changed the societal roles of disabled people. The Act was signed by President Bush in July 1990. It prohibited the discrimination of disabled people by employers and also required that mass transportation, commercial buildings and public accommodations be accessible to disabled people. After the law was passed, Congress realized that many people with disabilities were secluded from society and could not live independently. Before the ADA was made into a law, disabled people could not land a job, enter a restaurant or store, or access the bus. A 1986 poll revealed that 66 percent of disabled citizens were jobless, in spite of the fact that many proclaimed they desired and were capable of employment. The same poll showed that 40 percent of handicapped people could not find a job due to the inaccessibility of transportation and public places. As a result of implementation of the ADA, 6&amp;nbsp;million private businesses and 80,000 state and local governments made their facilities available to the disabled. In July 1992, the provisions of the Act incorporating 43&amp;nbsp;million disabled individuals in to the workforce were set into motion. Many business owners realized that the changes made to their establishment were of little financial consequence, typically under $500. The conditions of disabled people before and after this law was passed are examples of how society constructs disability through discrimination and physical barriers. By eliminating these obstacles, the disabled are more integrated into society.&lt;ref&gt;Stalcup, pp. 17, 23, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment of disability==
In the United States, according to the [[Social Security Administration]], to be considered "disabled," a claimant must provide medical evidence displaying proof of and severity of the impairment(s). Medical evidence comes from sources that have treated or evaluated the claimant for his/her impairment(s). Acceptable medical sources include medical professionals including licensed physicians, licensed or certified psychologists, licensed optometrists (only for purposes of establishing visual disorders), licensed podiatrists (only for purposes of establishing impairments of the foot and/or ankle), and qualified speech-language pathologists (only for purposes of establishing speech or language impairments). Qualified speech-language pathologists must be licensed by the State education in the State in which he/she practices, or hold a Certificate of clinical Competence from the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/evidentiary.htm|title=Disability Evaluation Under Social Security Part II - Evidentiary Requirements. |publisher=The United States Social Security Administration |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying for disability (and the assessment of) can take place in person at the Social Security field office, by telephone, by mail, or by filing online. The application process involves supplying a description of the impairment, treatment sources, and other information. A field office then verifies non-medical eligibility requirement (including age, employment, marital status, or Social Security coverage information) and sends the case to the state agency ([[Disability Determination Services]], or DDS) for evaluation (DDS are state agencies that develop medical evidence and deciding whether or not a claimant - the person requesting disability benefits - is disabled or blind under the law).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/general-info.htm|title=Disability Evaluation Under Social Security Part I - General Information. |publisher=The United States Social Security Administration |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
===Paralympics===
Since the invention of the television in the early 1900s, this medium has held a pervasive influence on our outlook on many aspects of society, disability being one of them. One example is how the 2000 Paralympics versus the Olympics were televised. The 2000 Sydney Paralympic Games, one of the biggest in history, was barely acknowledged by mainstream media prior to the event. The Sydney Paralympic organizers worked extensively to try to solicit coverage of the Games. For more than two years, they negotiated with Channel 7 to broadcast the competitions. Channel 7 proposed that if the Paralympics paid them $3&amp;nbsp;million in case of lack of advertising revenue they would agree to broadcast the event. Eventually, the [[Australian Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) and Channel 7 announced they would be broadcasting the Games and Channel 7 would “complement” the coverage with a highlights package that ran daily on its pay-TV Channel. ABC also promised to broadcast at least 60&amp;nbsp;minutes of daily highlights. Later on, ABC finally agreed to air a live broadcast of the opening and closing ceremonies. The opening and closing ceremonies were actually quite popular amongst viewers, watched by 2.5&amp;nbsp;million; however the rest of the games proved to be quite the opposite. While the Olympics were covered live throughout the entire event, the Paralympics apparently was not important enough to deserve the same live coverage before the initial showing. By deeming the disabled to be less important than those without disabilities and by separating the Olympics and Paralympics, disability is socially constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Goggin, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
Over the last several decades, technology has transformed networks, services, and communication, and promoted convergence of telecommunications, computer use, etc. Technology changes, or, the [[Digital Revolution]], has changed how people work, learn, and interact. The digital revolution has directed people to use computers, cell phones, and other technologies more and more. However, many people who use such technology experience a form of disability. Even if it is not physically visible, those with, for example, cognitive impairments, hand tremors, vision impairments, have some form of disability that don't allow them to be able to fully access technology the way that those without a "technological disability" do.

===Education===
Special education "...is a social construction whereby a society can label a group in order to isolate responsibility for that group's welfare and thereby protect normal sources of power. In education, society has created many social categories, including learning disabilities. Such social categories represent the structure of society. The success of special educations students who have learning disabilities seems to be measured in material terms; but if they don't have the opportunity to achieve this success, it is hard to turn to the American community for support, as so many people in this community condemn them for their differences.

Thus, education tries to restore the idea of a moral community, one in which the members question what constitutes a good life, to form a reconceptualization of education, where physical and mental conditions would be seen as part of a range of abilities, where different talents were distributed in different ways, and all talents would be recognized. All students would be included in the educational network instead of being set apart as special cases, and it would be acknowledged that all humans have special needs and no one is normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Capper|first=Colleen|title=Educational Administration in a Pluralistic Society|publisher=State University of New York Pr|date=July 1993|pages=173–174, 176–177|isbn=978-0791413739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Strozzi Institute''' is an organization located in [[Oakland, California]]  that offers [[coaching#Applications|coaching]] services and trainings in [[leadership]], [[organizational development]], and personal mastery.  It uses a [[somatics|somatic]] approach to learning. Programs are offered primarily at the institute's [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma]] training center.&lt;ref name="dance" /&gt;
{{TOC right}}

==History==
Strozzi Institute was founded in 1985 by [[Richard Strozzi-Heckler]], Ph.D. as an application of his research into a "somatic philosophy of [[learning]]". 

In the 1970s Strozzi-Heckler and Robert K. Hall, M.D. developed The Lomi School of [[body oriented psychotherapy]], influenced by the work of [[Fritz Perls]], [[Ida Pauline Rolf|Ida Rolf]], [[Randolph Stone]], and [[Charan Singh (guru)|Charan Singh]].&lt;ref name="groundworks"/&gt; In addition to the usual [[psychiatric]] and [[psychoanalytic theory|psychoanalytic]] methods, this program includes touch, group process, [[breathwork]], [[Vipassanā|attention training]], and movement to its approach,&lt;ref name="groundworks"&gt;Johnson, D., ''Groundworks: Narratives of Embodiment''. North Atlantic (1997) {{ISBN|978-1-55643-235-4}} p. 116 https://books.google.com/books?id=pRnAGCOBxFEC&lt;/ref&gt; to provide its framework for working with the mind unified with the physical body.&lt;ref name="body"&gt;Davidson, A., Davis, V., ''Body Brilliance: Mastering Your Five Vital Intelligences'' Elite Books (2010) {{ISBN|978-1-60070-025-5}} p. 70, 220&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1985 Strozzi-Heckler contributed to a [[pilot program]] for the [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] to evaluate [[Mind-body connection|mind-body]] approaches to [[Military education and training|military training]]. In addition to many of the measured outcomes related to increased [[endurance]], [[alertness]], capacity for [[stress management]], and [[Sports psychology#Team dynamics|team cohesion]], participants unexpectedly demonstrated significant increases in leadership characteristics.  Reflecting on this, Strozzi-Heckler began exploring ways to adapt the program for leaders in business and government.&lt;ref name="dance"/&gt;In collaboration with [[Fernando Flores]] during the 1980s and 1990s, Flores's Ontology of Language research into [[speech act#In computer science|speech acts]] was integrated and applied to the somatic leadership domain. &lt;ref&gt; Wildflower, L., "The Hidden History of Coaching" McGraw-Hill Education (2013) {{ISBN|978-0335245406}} p.66 https://books.google.com/books?id=IKGSyKsY-hkC&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Strozzi Institute introduced a training program for [[coaching|coaches]] interested in their somatic approach.

==Strozzi Somatics==
The Strozzi Institute methodology, known as Strozzi Somatics, is used one-on-one and in groups of varying size.

The Strozzi Somatics [[methodology]] makes a distinction between ''soma'' - the living body in its entirety, and the mechanistic view of the physical body as an assemblage of anatomical parts.  Using this first definition the body is regarded as the primary domain of feeling, action, language, and meaning.&lt;ref name="jasp"&gt;Strean, W.B., Strozzi-Heckler, R., "(The) Body (of) Knowledge: Somatic Contributions to the Practice of Sport Psychology" ''Journal of Sports Psychology'', September 2009 p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, coaches observe the ways people hold their bodies and how they respond to stress situations, such as verbal or physical surprises.  The body’s overall organization in this way is referred to as a somatic shape.&lt;ref name="keleman"&gt;Keleman, S., ''Emotional Anatomy''.  Center Press (1985) {{ISBN|978-0-934320-07-8}}  p.103&lt;/ref&gt; Each person’s unique somatic shape is formed by responses to past experiences, positive and negative, which are established as deep, mostly unconscious patterns of muscular activity in the body. Over time these patterns produce conditioned tendencies of reaction to people, situations and environments.&lt;ref name="fem"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-harrow/reclaiming-feminine-value_b_409615.html |title=Susan Harrow: Reclaiming Feminine Values and Virtues in the Workplace and Home |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2010-01-04 |accessdate=2012-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strozzi-Heckler has described the process in which, when an individual is exposed to a stressful stimulus, they revert to this conditioned tendency, limiting their available choices for action.&lt;ref name="AofC"&gt;Strozzi-Heckler, R., ''Anatomy of Change: A Way to Move Through Life's Transitions''. North Atlantic Books (1997) {{ISBN|978-1-55643-147-0}} p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Withdrawal, fear, attempting to dominate, rigidity, and over-accommodation are examples of different conditioned tendency shapes.&lt;ref name="dance"/&gt;  Because this is a [[Somatics|somatic]] event rather than an exclusively [[Cognition|cognitive]] one, new information or theoretical insight will not shift the response.  As an illustration, he describes a team leader who has extensive education in management principles but, especially under stress, comports himself in a way that produces mistrust and resentment from the people he manages, eventually creating significant breakdowns within his team.&lt;ref name="dojo"&gt;Strozzi-Heckler, R., ''The Leadership Dojo''. Frog Books (2007) {{ISBN|978-1-58394-201-7}} pp. 27-32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership ===
Strozzi Institute has stressed that leadership characteristics often considered innate are teachable, and can be improved with practice. These traits include: high [[self awareness#In psychology|self awareness]] and awareness of the environment, being open to possibilities rather than limited to past options, being motivated by a connection to what one cares about,
the ability to deal directly with matters that need attention,
directing attention outward in a way that enables listening and connection with others,
and the ability to coordinate with others and empathize with their concerns.
&lt;ref name="voxam"&gt;Interview with Strozzi-Heckler http://www.voiceamerica.com/episode/26740/the-body-of-leadership 6:50 - 11:48, 19:20 - 20:05&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aikido Influence===
Many of the practices taught are adapted from [[aikido]] and different forms of [[meditation]].
Aikido movements are presented in a non-[[martial arts|martial]] context and principles of the art such as:
''centering'' oneself, ''facing'' an attack, ''extending'' outward into the environment, ''entering'' into shared space, and ''blending'' with the momentum of an incursion, are used as physical metaphors to guide the practice of embodying leadership characteristics.&lt;ref name="dance"/&gt;
An aikido [[dojo]], ''Two Rock Aikido'', is located on the Strozzi Institute site in Sonoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tworockaikido.com |title=Two Rock Aikido, Petaluma - California |publisher=Tworockaikido.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strozzi Bodywork===
Working from the premise that the body and the [[self]] are indistinguishable from one another, Strozzi Institute offers training in a style of [[bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]] developed by Strozzi-Heckler and Hall to produce change in a person's core historical limitations.   Strozzi Bodywork involves addressing deeply held muscular contractions (also known as [[character armor|armoring]]) maintained in the soma using touch, breath, and directed attention. Practitioners train to develop an [[empathy|empathetic]], compassionate presence that can build trust and enable them to work with others through a variety of [[emotion]]al states. Some somatic coaches use Strozzi Bodywork in their coaching sessions.

===Applications===
The Strozzi Somatics methodology has been applied to a broad range of organizations and with diverse populations. These include Fortune 50 companies, [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEALs]], [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]], [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]], [[social justice]] groups, professional sports teams, as well as urban gang members, [[prisoner]]s, Olympic athletes,&lt;ref name="dance"/&gt; and survivors of sexual trauma.&lt;ref name="heal"&gt;Haines, S., ''Healing Sex: A Mind-Body Approach to Healing Sexual Trauma'' Cleis (2007) {{ISBN|978-1-57344-293-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strozzi Institute has contributed to U.S. Military [[counter-insurgency]] training, integrating somatic practices to enhance soldiers' abilities to connect with others across cultures rather than rely predominantly on force.  Strozzi-Heckler has said, "Working with the body gives you a way to do that because it transcends words and language. It takes us to that common core of being human."&lt;ref name="dance"&gt;Helgesen, S. “The Dance of Power” ''Strategy+Business'', Winter 2007/Issue 49, http://www.strategy-business.com/article/07406?gko=c0c2d&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Beacon Light''''' is a painting by [[J. M. W. Turner]]. It was given to the [[National Museum of Wales]] by the Davies sisters ([[Gwendoline Davies|Gwendoline]] and [[Margaret Davies|Margaret]]). For some time it was regarded as a fake, but is now accepted as authentic.

==Provenance==
''Beacon Light'' was among a number of works that were said to have been given by Turner to his mistress, Mrs Booth. It was sold at Christie's by her son, John Pound (her son by her first marriage).

In 1922, it was sold as a genuine Turner and the Davies sisters (Gwendoline and Margaret) spent £2,625 to buy it.&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann, Luke; "The Davies sisters' Turners in Cardiff"; ''British Art Journal'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/industry-to-impressionism/ Museum of Wales] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011163636/http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/industry-to-impressionism/ |date=11 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of Gwendoline Davies, it was among seven works by Turner that were donated to the National Museum of Wales.

==Doubts as to authenticity==
Shortly after the donation, doubts were raised about its authenticity and that of two other Turners donated by the sisters.

Butlin and Joll dated the work to c1835-40 and suggest that it is a fragment of a larger canvas 'which has certainly been worked on by a hand other than Turner's'.&lt;ref&gt;Butlin, Martin, and Evelyn Joli. ''The Paintings of J. M. W. Turner''&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, it was believed to depict the Needles on the Isle of Wight

It was removed from display, but did appear in a 2007 exhibition. It returned to display in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/art/online/?action=show_item&amp;item=1836 National Museum of Wales]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Fake or Fortune?''==
It was featured on the BBC TV programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' Scientific analysis showed that the paint used was consistent with Turner's known usage and that the same paint had been used for the whole of the picture. An X-ray showed that a lighthouse at the summit of the bluff had been painted over. [[Philip Mould]] and [[Bendor Grosvenor]] were able to establish that the scene was near [[Margate]] and not on the [[Isle of Wight]] as had been previously believed. The evidence for the painting's authenticity was presented to [[Martin Butlin]], the co-author of the Turner ''[[catalogue raisonné]]'', who accepted that the work was genuine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode| title = Turner: A Miscarriage of Justice?|series = Fake or Fortune?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01n39kg|accessdate = 10 December 2012|network = BBC|date = 23 September 2012|seriesno=2|number=2|transcript =| transcripturl =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
