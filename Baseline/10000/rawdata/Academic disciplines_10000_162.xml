      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5260">The '''1970 British Cohort Study''' (BCS70) is a continuing, multi-disciplinary [[longitudinal survey]] monitoring the development of babies born in the UK during the week of 5–11 April 1970.

==History==
Since the start of the BCS70, eight full sets of data have been collected in 1970, 1975, 1980, 1986, 1996, 1999/2000, 2004/2005 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/444794/DFE-RR458_Summary_of_longitudinal_surveys.pdf|title=Summary of longitudinal surveys|last=Coleman|first=Nick|date=2015|website=Department for Education|publisher=British Government|page=9|isbn=978-1-78105-510-6|access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following survey was planned for 2016/2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hra.nhs.uk/news/research-summaries/1970-british-cohort-study-2016-17-survey/|title=1970 British Cohort Study: 2016-17 Survey|last=Sullivan|first=Alice|date=2015-09-08|website=Health Research Authority|publisher=National Health Service|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first wave in 1970, called the [http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/page.aspx?&amp;sitesectionid=810&amp;sitesectiontitle=BCS+1970 British Births Survey], was conducted by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100328202035/http://www.wellbeingofwomen.org.uk/research/national-birthday-trust-fund/ National Birthday Trust Fund] together with the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] in order to collect information to compare with those of the [[National Child Development Study]] (NCDS). The following two sweeps in 1975 and 1980, when the study was known as the [http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/page.aspx?&amp;sitesectionid=803&amp;sitesectiontitle=BCS+1975 Child Health and Education Study] (CHES), were carried out by the Department of Child Health at Bristol University. The 1986 survey was conducted by the [http://www.longviewuk.com/pages/iccs.shtml International Centre for Child Studies] and called Youthscan which was then taken over for the following surveys by the Social Statistics Research Unit (SSRU), now known as the [http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk Centre for Longitudinal Studies] (CLS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esds.ac.uk/longitudinal/access/bcs70/l33229.asp ESDS Longitudinal, BCS70 dataset guide], retrieved September 17, 2009. [https://www.webcitation.org/5k5FzJGKx?url=http://www.esds.ac.uk/longitudinal/access/bcs70/l33229.asp Archived] 2009-09-26.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016 there were 770 papers and books published about the 1970 British Cohort Study.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pearson|2016|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope of the BCS70 has been broadened in the course of the different surveys. While the focus was on medical aspects at birth, factors such as physical, educational, social and economic development were subsequently taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esds.ac.uk/findingData/snDescription.asp?sn=5585&amp;amp;key=/&amp;amp;flag=true Economic and Social Data Service (ESDS), BC70 catalogue record entry], retrieved September 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the 1970 birth cohort study created a [[Facebook]] page for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pearson|2016|pp=337–339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/19942595903/?fref=nf|title=1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70)|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Facebook group page|publisher=Facebook|access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology and scope==
The primary method of data collection consists of face-to-face interviews (with the parents), self-completion questionnaires and psychological and educational measurements. The sample size included 17,287 babies in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland born in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esds.ac.uk/findingData/bcs70.asp BCS70 dataset guide], retrieved September 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Survey results==
The findings from the BCS70 have generated over 770 publications, a list of which can be found [http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/bibliography here]. One key publication which also includes data of other British Cohort Studies is [http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/page.aspx?&amp;sitesectionid=937&amp;sitesectiontitle=Changing+Britain%2C+Changing+Lives%3A+Three+generations+at+the+turn+of+the+century Elsa Ferri, John Bynner and Michael Wadsworth (eds.)(2003) Changing Britain, Changing Lives: three generations at the turn of the century ]&lt;ref&gt;ESDS Longitudinal, BCS70 dataset guide&lt;/ref&gt;

The medium of instruction is the [[English language]].


==History==

The creation of Al Akhawayn University was largely funded by [[King Fahd]] of Saudi Arabia from an endowment intended for the cleanup of an oil spill off the coast of Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jsu.edu/news/july_dec2005/07202005b.html|title=Moroccan Encounter:Letters from a Foreign Land|website=www.jsu.edu|date=2005-07-20|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cleanup was never realized as the wind blew the oil spill away and the endowment was used to create the university. Al Akhawayn University was founded by Royal Decree (''[[Moroccan Dahir|Dahir]]'') in 1993 and officially inaugurated by the former King [[Hassan II]] of Morocco on January 16, 1995. The Arabic name ''al-akhawayn'', literally the "two brothers," refers to the two respective kings.

==Academics==
With 2,173 full-time students living and studying together on a residential campus in the Middle Atlas town of Ifrane, Al Akhawayn offers undergraduate and graduate program options in the [[Humanities]] and [[Social Sciences]], [[Science education|Science]] and [[Engineering]], and [[Business Administration]] – all connected by a common core based on the American liberal arts model.

{{about|the entertainment industry|the concept of ancillary markets in power systems|ancillary services (electric power)}}

'''Ancillary markets''' are non-theatrical markets for [[feature films]], like [[home video]], television, [[Pay Per View]], [[Video on demand|VOD]], Internet streaming, airlines and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://indieranch.com/distribute.html |title=Knowing your audience is one thing, reaching them is another. |first=Yuri |last=Koll |work=indieranch.com |date=November 20, 2008 |accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maccs.com/non-theatrical |title=MACCS International Theatrical Film Distribution Software |accessdate=July 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109215530/http://www.maccs.com/non-theatrical |archivedate=January 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Before television, studios played their films in theaters exclusively. However, in 1950 many studios began to sell all their pre-1948 features to television syndicators. The television syndicators then would use these films to fill in their programming schedules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Criticism-Ideology/Distribution-ANCILLARY-MARKETS.html |title=Ancillary markets - Distribution |first= |last= |work=filmreference.com |year=2013 |accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back in the 1960s, the first domestic ancillary market for feature films was created. NBC was the first to practice the market on September 23, 1961 by programming "NBC Saturday Night at the Movies." After such success, ABC became the second network ever to program a series of prime time features in 1962. One of the other networks, CBS, followed and added a prime time feature program in 1965.

Today, feature films opens in motion picture theaters to establish its box-office value. After that is established, it is then released to ancillary markets in a particular order as follows:

* Video and [[Pay Per View]] (PPV)
* Premium cable services such as HBO, Showtime, and Cinemax
* Cable television
* Network television
* Television syndication

The sequence is to maximize the full economic potential of each market.

==VCR==
Home video recorders were made public when Sony introduced the half-inch Betamax cassette in 1975. Following Betamax, the company JVC introduced the Video Home System (VHS).  Marketed by RCA and manufactured by Matsushita, VHS soon became known as the video-cassette recorders (VCRs). VCRs, which gave the consumer the option of recording programs from television, were a new form of competition in the demanding consumer market. VCRs revenue contributed to the development of the ancillary market of video and DVD. By the 1980s, five million households owned VCRs. Major studios had not yet adapted to the new video technologies that were being developed for consumers. There were no anticipations of new markets or other opportunities to expand until an entrepreneur, Andre Blay, opened Hollywood film companies’ eyes. Blay wanted the license to transfer and sell their films on tape.  After he succeeded and his approach was beneficial, film companies all around became a part of the video distribution. The film companies could not deny the fact that this new distribution would lead to a new revenue stream.&lt;ref&gt;P., McDonald &amp; J., Wasko. The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry.2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==DVD==
As the VHS market saturated, multiple media executives and manufacturers liked the idea of utilizing other home video technologies. In 1993, the film industry upgraded their technology with the creation of several new formats including the DVD, or digital video disc. Many manufacturers such as the Japanese (Hitachi, JVC, Matsushita, Mitsubishi, Pioneer, Sony and Toshiba) and the European (Philips and Thomson) collaborated to facilitate development of the DVD Forum. In March 1997, the US launch of the DVD systems went smoothly due to Hollywood's solidarity. Manufacturers and film studios decided to avoid making the same mistake of the VHS format battles and agreed upon a universal standard of cooperation. When first introduced in 1997, DVDs sold at the low price of $20, for which they offered high-quality image and extra special features. Consumers liked the advantages of the DVDs and soon surpassed VHS sales.&lt;ref&gt;Wasser, Frederick.(2008) "Ancillary Markets - Video and DVD: Hollywood Retools". Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p. 127-128&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premium television==

The first premium rate television services were [[Phonevision]], [[Telemeter (pay television)|Telemeter]], SubscriberVision, among others. None of them were successful, until the launch of Home Box Office ([[HBO]]) in 1972, considered the first successful premium-rate subscription television service. Other services were launched: [[Z Channel]], [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], [[The Movie Channel]], [[Cinemax]], [[Spotlight (TV channel)|Spotlight]] and [[Home Theater Network]]. Only Showtime, The Movie Channel and Cinemax survived through the 1980s. These premium rate services air features unedited, uncut, and commercial-free, the same way they were shown on theaters and/or home video.

==Cable television==
{{Empty section|date=June 2011}}

==Network television==
Out of the many ancillary markets out there, none were more effective and revenue rewarding than network television, and eventually syndication began. [[Amanda D. Lotz]] spoke on the radical change in her book titled ''Television Will Be Revolutionized (2008)."
She mentions how time went on and as the post-network era developed, that the limited ways there were for medium to be distributed was eliminated. What was expanding, and evolving was network television as a whole.&lt;Lotz 85&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lotz|first=Amanda|title=Television Will be Revolutionized|year=2007|publisher=NYU Press|pages=86|url=http://cinema.usc.edu/archivedassets/096/15646.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&gt; At first channels were few, and very limited. But soon came the multi-channel transition, then on with the creation of cable TV. As that later expended cable began to see the 'cash cow' in that and began selling shares to different networks in order to air their studio programs. Not only did Network Television open up ancillary markets for TV, but other markets as well. The VCR then became a hot commodity, because the consumer wanted the option of recording. That slowly transitioned to the DVD that took out the VCR, and finally DVR. Which seems to be just that, a VCR and a DVD combined. Network television took a gigantic step when it later allowed programs to have different showing dates, and even multiple air times. This offered different networks to still be able to ear revenue off of an older film that already has left the box office.

==Making Television Safe for Film==

According to McDonald and Wasko, Hollywood's interest in emerging medium of television dates from the 1920s and includes experiments with the developing technology, an alternative model of television as home theater, applications for television frequencies, as well as investments in broadcasting companies that were exploring television (Anderson, 1994; Hilmes, 1990; Wasko, 1994). The evidence suggests that studios clearly wanted to control the development and implementation of television technology. Securing that control required the assistance of the Federal Communication Commission, which regulated television's development by articulating technical standards and operating rules and through the FCC's exclusive right to license the use of television frequencies for experimentation or broadcast (McDonald and Wasko, p.&amp;nbsp;107).

==Video games==
Video games are a rapidly growing ancillary market for feature films. Video game over-all gross income has consistently surpassed that of movie sales since 2004. Because of the increased interest in video games many major media and communication companies have begun to show interest in video games as a way to market, brand, and advertise for their product.  Some movies that have benefited from this are the ''Harry Potter'', ''Lord of the Rings'', and ''James Bond'' series. Because the video game industry has been able to outplay and outgross many movies, video game manufacturers are beginning to look in the direction of producing their own movies as well. Microsoft's producers of ''Halo'' have decided to pass Hollywood studios and produce their own movie.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Randy.(2008) "Ancillary Markets - Video Games: Promises and Challenges of an Emerging Industry". Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p. 132-133&lt;/ref&gt;

Hollywood has shown interest in the video game industry as an ancillary market almost as far as video games have existed. The film industry's goal within the video game industry is to either seek control and therefore ownership of the video game market or to license products to video game producers. Once the video game profits are high, that is when Hollywood seeks control. On the other hand, when profits are down, that is when Hollywood offers the licensing. The collaboration had always been problematic since the film industry had been uncertain about the development of video games. Hollywood has seen video games as another promotional scheme for a film.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Randy.(2008) "Ancillary Markets - Video Games: Promises and Challenges of an Emerging Industry". Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recorded Music==
Hollywood has had interactions with the recorded music industry that dates back as far as the studio system itself.  The interactions between the two include three main periods; 1927-1957: recorded music as a form of promotion, 1957-1977: recorded music as cross-promotion and ancillary revenue, and 1977-1997: recorded music as cross-promotion, ancillary revenue stream, and means of spreading risk.
In addition to music's promotional value, studios realized that, "A chart success was an effective way of generating additional revenue for their companies, both in terms of publishing and performance royalties and, of course, in outright sales."  Recorded music proved to be of great value as an ancillary market to the film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-1-4051-3388-3|pages=143–151|author=Smith, Jeff|authorlink=Ancillary Markets-Recorded Music: Charting the Rise and Fall of the Soundtrack Album|editor=McDonald &amp; Wasko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2016}}

'''Animal studies''' is a recently recognized field in which animals are studied in a variety of cross-disciplinary ways. Scholars who engage in animal studies may be formally trained in a number of diverse fields, including [[geography]], [[art history]], [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[film studies]], [[geography]], [[history]], [[psychology]], [[literary studies]], [[museology]], [[philosophy]], communication, and [[sociology]]. They may engage with questions about literal animals, or about notions of "animality" or "brutality," employing various theoretical perspectives, including [[feminism]], [[Marxist theory]], and [[queer theory]]. Using these perspectives, those who engage in animal studies seek to understand both human-animal relations now and in the past, and to understand animals as beings-in-themselves, separate from our knowledge of them. Because the field is still developing, scholars and others have some freedom to define their own criteria about what issues may structure the field.

==History==
As an interdisciplinary subject, animal studies exists at the intersection of a number of different fields of study. Different fields began to turn to animals as an important topic at different times and for various reasons, and these separate disciplinary histories shape how scholars approach animal studies.

In part, animal studies developed out of the [[animal liberation movement]] and was grounded in [[ethics|ethical]] questions about co-existence with other species: whether it is moral to eat animals, to do scientific research on animals for human benefit, and so on. Animal studies scholars who explore the field from an ethical perspective frequently cite [[Australian]] philosopher [[Peter Singer]]'s 1975 work, ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'',&lt;ref name="Gorman"&gt;{{cite web |author=Gorman, James |date=12 January 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/science/animal-studies-move-from-the-lab-to-the-lecture-hall.html?pagewanted=all |title=Animal Studies Move From the Lab to the Lecture Hall |publisher=The New York Times |access-date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a founding document in animal studies.  Singer's work followed [[Jeremy Bentham#Animal rights|Jeremy Bentham]]'s by trying to expand [[utilitarian]] questions about pleasure and pain beyond humans to other [[sentience|sentient]] creatures.

Theorists interested in the role of animals in literature, culture, and [[Continental philosophy]] also consider the late work of [[Jacques Derrida]] a driving force behind the rise of interest in animal studies in the humanities.&lt;ref name="Gorman" /&gt;  Derrida's final lecture series, ''The Animal That Therefore I Am'', examined how interactions with animal life affect human attempts to define humanity and the self through language. Taking up Derrida's deconstruction and extending it to other cultural territory, [[Cary Wolfe]] published ''Animal Rites'' in 2003 and critiqued earlier animal rights philosophers such as [[Peter Singer]] and Thomas Regan. Wolfe's study points out an insidious humanism at play in their philosophies and others. Recently also the Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] published a book on the question of the animal: ''The Open. Man and Animal''.

==Research topics and methodologies==
Researchers in animal studies examine the questions and issues that arise when traditional modes of [[Humanities|humanistic]] and [[Science|scientific]] inquiry begin to take animals seriously as subjects of thought and activity.  Students of animal studies may examine how humanity is defined in relation to animals, or how representations of animals create understandings (and misunderstandings) of other species. In order to do so, animal studies pays close attention to the ways that humans [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]] animals, and asks how humans might avoid bias in observing other creatures. For instance, [[Donna Haraway]]'s book, ''Primate Visions'', examines how [[diorama]]s created for the [[American Museum of Natural History]] showed family groupings that conformed to the traditional human [[nuclear family]], which misrepresented the animals' observed behavior in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Donna |last=Haraway |authorlink=Donna_Haraway |jstor=466593 |title=Teddy Bear Patriarchy: Taxidermy in the Garden of Eden, New York City, 1908–1936 |journal=Social Text |issue=11 |date=Winter 1984–1985 |pages=20–64 |publisher=Duke University Press |doi = 10.2307/466593}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical approaches in animal studies have also considered representations of non-human animals in popular culture, including species diversity in animated films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Becoming-Animal Is A Trap For Humans |first=Timothy |last=Laurie |journal=Deleuze and the Non-Human |year=2015 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10912960}}, eds. Hannah Stark and Jon Roffe.&lt;/ref&gt;

By highlighting these issues, animal studies strives to re-examine traditional [[Ethics|ethical]], [[Politics|political]], and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] categories in the context of a renewed attention to and respect for animal life. The assumption that focusing on animals might clarify human knowledge is neatly expressed in [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s famous dictum that animals are "good to think."&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude. ''Totemism''. Boston: Beacon Press, 1963, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bad quarto''', in Shakespearean scholarship, is a [[book size|quarto-sized]] publication of one of [[Shakespeare]]'s plays that is considered spurious, [[pirated]] from a theatre without permission by someone in the audience writing it down as it was spoken or written down later by an actor or group of actors, which, according to a theory, has been termed "[[memorial reconstruction]]". Since the quarto derives from performance and lacks a direct link to the author's original manuscript, the text would be expected to contain corruptions, abridgements and paraphrasings.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Harold. "Introduction". Shakespeare, William.  ''Hamlet''. Arden Shakespeare (1982) {{ISBN|1-903436-67-2}}. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duthie 1-4"&gt;Duthie, George Ian. "Introduction; the good and bad quartos". ''The Bad Quarto of Hamlet''. CUP Archive (1941). pp. 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

That is in contrast to a "good quarto", which is considered to be a text that is authorised, one that may have been printed from the author's manuscript, or a scribal copy or prompt copy that is based on the author's manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Duthie, George Ian. "Introduction; the good and bad quartos". ''The Bad Quarto of Hamlet''. CUP Archive (1941). pp. 5-9&lt;/ref&gt; "Bad quartos" are considered to include the first quartos of ''Romeo and Juliet'', ''Henry V'', ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'', and ''Hamlet''.&lt;ref name="Duthie 1-4"/&gt;

The concept has expanded to include quartos of plays by other Elizabethan authors, including Peele's ''[[The Battle of Alcazar (play)|The Battle of Alcazar]]'', [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Greene's]] ''Orlando Furioso'', and the collaborative script, ''[[Sir Thomas More (play)|Sir Thomas More]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Erne, Lukas.

==Origins of bad quarto theory==
The concept of the "bad quarto" as a category of text was created by bibliographer [[Alfred W. Pollard]] in his book ''Shakespeare Folios and Quartos'' (1909).  The idea came to him in his reading of the address by the editors, [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]], which appears at the beginning of Shakespeare's First Folio and is titled, "To the Great Variety of Readers". Heminges and Condell refer to "diuerse stolne, and surreptitious copies" of the plays. It had been thought that that reference was generally to quarto editions of the plays.

Pollard, however, claims that Heminges and Condell meant to refer only to "bad" quartos, and Pollard lists as "bad" the first quartos of ''Romeo and Juliet'' (1597), ''Henry V'' (1600), ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'' (1602), ''Hamlet'' (1603), and ''Pericles'' (1609). Pollard pointed out that not only the texts contained "badness" but also there was badness in those who pirated the plays.&lt;ref&gt;De Grazia, Margreta. "The essential Shakespeare and the material book." Orgel, Stephe and others, editors. ''Shakespeare and the Literary Tradition''. Courier Corporation (1999) {{ISBN|9780815329671}}, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar [[W. W. Greg]] worked closely with Pollard and published the bad quarto of ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'',&lt;ref&gt;Greg, W. W. editor. [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001373658 ''Shakespeare's Merry Wives of Windsor''], 1602. Oxford; At the Clarendon Press (1910)&lt;/ref&gt; which is a work that is significant in the history of the "bad quarto" theory. Greg described how the text may have been copied, and he identified the actor who played the role of "Host" as the culprit. Greg called the process that the actor may have used "[[memorial reconstruction]]", a phrase later used by other scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, Alfred W. ''Shakespeare folios and quartos: a study in the bibliography of Shakespeare's plays'', 1594–1685. University of Michigan Library (1909).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erne, Lukas. ''Shakespeare as Literary Dramatist''. Cambridge University Press (2013) {{ISBN|9781107029651}}. p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bad quarto, good quarto, first folio.png|thumb|320px|Comparison of the "To be, or not to be" soliloquy in the first three editions of Hamlet]]

For Shakespeare, the [[First Folio]] of 1623 is the crucial document; of the 36 plays contained in that collection, 18 have no other source. The other 18 plays had been printed in [[Quarto (text)|quarto]] form at least once between 1594 and 1623, but since the prefatory matter in the First Folio itself warns against earlier texts, which are termed "stol'n and surreptitious copies, maimed and deformed by frauds and stealths of injurious impostors", 18th- and 19th-century editors of Shakespeare tended to ignore the quarto texts and preferred the Folio.

It was at first suspected that the bad quarto texts represented [[shorthand]] reporting, a practice mentioned by [[Thomas Heywood]] in the Prologue to his 1605 play ''If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody''; reporters would surreptitiously take down a play's text in shorthand during a performance and pirate a popular play for a competing interest. Greg and R. C. Rhodes argued instead for an alternative theory: since some of the minor speeches varied less than those of major characters, their hypothesis was that the actors who played the minor roles had [[memorial reconstruction|reconstructed the play texts from memory]] and gave an accurate report of the parts that they themselves had memorized and played but a less correct report of the other actors' parts.

The idea caught on among Shakespeare scholars. Peter Alexander added ''The First Part of the Contention Betwixt the Two Famous Houses of York and Lancaster'' (1594) and ''The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York'' (1595), the earliest versions of ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]'' and ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]],'' to the roster of bad quartos; they had been previously thought to be source plays for Shakespeare's later versions of the same stories. The concept of the bad quarto was extended to play texts by authors other than Shakespeare, and by the second half of the 20th century, the idea was widely being used.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, ''Shakespeare Companion'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the end of the century, dissenting views had been published, such as the work of Laurie Maguire, then at the [[University of Ottawa]].

==Criticism and alternative hypotheses==
Some problems exist with the bad quarto hypothesis. The first quarto of [[Richard III (play)|''Richard III'']] is considered a bad quarto "even though it is an unusually 'good' bad quarto".&lt;ref&gt;Evans, ''Riverside Shakespeare,'' p. 754.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander himself recognised that the idea of memorial reconstruction did not apply perfectly to the two plays that he studied, which possessed problematical features that could not be explained. He maintained that the quartos of the two early histories were "partial" memorial reconstructions.

Some critics, including [[Eric Sams]] and [[Hardin Craig]], dispute the entire concept of memorial reconstruction by pointing out that unlike shorthand reporting, no reliable historical evidence exists that actors reconstructed plays from memory. They believe that memorial reconstruction is a modern fiction. Individual scholars have sometimes preferred alternative explanations for variant texts such as revision. Steven Urkowitz has argued the hypothesis that ''[[King Lear]]'' is a revised work in ''Shakespeare's Revision of "King Lear"''. Some scholars have argued that the more challenging plays of the Shakespearean canon, like ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', make sense as works that Shakespeare wrote at one time and later revised.

Steven Roy Miller considers a revision hypothesis in preference to a bad-quarto hypothesis for ''The Taming of a Shrew'', the alternative version of Shakespeare's ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]].''&lt;ref&gt;Miller, pp. 6–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Burkhart's 1975 study ''Shakespeare's Bad Quartos: Deliberate Abridgements Designed for Performance by a Reduced Cast'' provides another alternative to the hypothesis of bad quartos as memorial reconstruction. Other studies have questioned the "orthodox view" on bad quartos, as in David Farley-Hills's work on ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.

==Maguire study==
In 1996, Laurie Maguire of the Department of English at the University of Ottawa published a study&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, L. ''Shakespeare's Suspect Texts: the 'Bad' Quartos and their context'' Cambridge Univ Press (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; of the concept of memorial reconstruction, based on the analysis of errors made by actors taking part in the [[BBC TV]] Shakespeare series, broadcast in the early 1980s. She found that actors typically add, drop or invert single words. However, the larger-scale errors that would be expected if actors were attempting to piece together the plays some time after their performance failed to appear in all but a few of the bad quartos. The study, however, uncovered some circumstantial evidence for memorial reconstruction in the bad quartos of ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' and ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]''. According to Maguire, virtually all the bad quartos appear to be accurate renditions of original texts that "merit our attention as valid texts in their own right".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''The Sunday Telegraph'', 17 March 1996, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Of other playwrights==
Though the bad quarto concept originated in reference to Shakespearean texts, scholars have also applied it to non-Shakespearean play texts of the [[English Renaissance]] era. In 1938, Leo Kirschbaum published "A Census of Bad Quartos" and included 20 play texts.&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, pp. 85–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Maguire's 1996 study examined 41 Shakespearean and non-Shakespearean editions that have been categorised as bad quartos, including the first editions of ''[[Arden of Feversham]]'', ''[[The Merry Devil of Edmonton]]'', and ''[[Fair Em]]'', plays of the [[Shakespeare Apocrypha]], plus [[George Chapman]]'s ''[[The Blind Beggar of Alexandria]]'', [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' and ''[[The Massacre at Paris]]'', ''Part 1'' of Heywood's ''[[If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody]]'' and [[Beaumont and Fletcher]]'s ''[[The Maid's Tragedy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, pp. 227–321.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''biophysical  environment''' is a [[life|biotic]] and [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] surrounding of an [[organism]] or [[population]], and consequently includes the factors that have an influence in their survival, development, and evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Biology online| title=''Environment. Definition''| url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Environment| accessdate=2012-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A biophysical environment can vary in scale from [[microscopic]] to global in extent. It can also be subdivided according to its attributes. Examples include the [[marine environment]], the [[atmospheric environment]] and the [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Life-environment interaction==
All life that has survived must have adapted to conditions of its environment. Temperature, light, humidity, soil nutrients, etc., all influence any species, within any environment. However life in turn modifies, in various forms, its conditions. Some long term modifications along the history of our planet have been significant, such as the incorporation of [[oxygen]] to the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]. This process consisted in the breakdown of [[carbon dioxide]] by [[anaerobic microorganism]]s that used the carbon in their [[metabolism]] and released the [[Atmospheric chemistry|oxygen to the atmosphere]]. This led to the existence of oxygen-based plant and animal life, the [[great oxygenation event]]. Other interactions are more immediate and simple, such as the smoothing effect that forests have on the temperature cycle, compared to neighboring unforested areas.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

[[Environmental science]] is the study of the interactions within the biophysical environment. Part of this [[Branches of science|scientific discipline]] is the investigation of the [[effect of human activity on the environment]]. [[Ecology]], a sub-discipline of biology and a part of environmental sciences, is often mistaken as a study of human induced effects on the environment. [[Environmental studies]] is a broader [[academic discipline]] that is the systematic study of interaction of humans with their environment. It is a broad field of study that includes the [[natural environment]], [[built environment]]s and [[social environment]]s.

Environmentalism is a broad social and philosophical movement that, in a large part, seeks to minimise and compensate the negative effect of human activity on the biophysical environment. The issues of concern for environmentalists usually relate to the natural environment with the more important ones being [[climate change]], [[species]] [[extinction]], [[pollution]], and [[old growth forest]] loss.

The '''bouba/kiki effect''' is a non-arbitrary mapping between speech sounds and the visual shape of objects. This effect was first observed by German-American psychologist [[Wolfgang Köhler]] in 1929.&lt;ref name = Kohler1929&gt;{{cite book | author = Köhler, W | year = 1929 | title = Gestalt Psychology. | location = New York | publisher = Liveright}}&lt;/ref&gt; In psychological experiments first conducted on the island of [[Tenerife]] (where the primary language is [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), Köhler showed forms similar to those shown at the right and asked participants which shape was called "takete" and which was called "baluba" ("maluma" in the 1947 version). Although not explicitly stated, Köhler implies that there was a strong preference to pair the jagged shape with "takete" and the rounded shape with "baluba".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Köhler, W | year = 1947 | title = Gestalt Psychology | edition = 2nd | location = New York | publisher = Liveright | page = 224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran]] and Edward Hubbard repeated Köhler's experiment using the words "kiki" and "bouba" and asked American college undergraduates and Tamil speakers in India "Which of these shapes is bouba and which is kiki?" In both groups, 95% to 98% selected the curvy shape as "bouba" and the jagged one as "kiki", suggesting that the human brain somehow attaches abstract meanings to the shapes and sounds in a consistent way.&lt;ref name = "Rama2001"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ramachandran, VS | author2 = Hubbard, EM | last-author-amp = yes | year = 2001b | title = Synaesthesia: A window into perception, thought and language | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 8 | issue = 12 | pages = 3–34 | url = http://cbc.ucsd.edu/pdf/Synaesthesia%20-%20JCS.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Work by [[Daphne Maurer]] and colleagues shows that even children as young as 2{{frac|1|2}} years old may show this effect as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maurer D, Pathman T, Mondloch CJ | last-author-amp = yes | year = 2006 | title = The shape of boubas: Sound-shape correspondences in toddlers and adults | journal = Developmental Science | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 316–322 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00495.x | pmid = 16669803 | url = http://psych.mcmaster.ca/maurerlab/Publications/Maurer_bouba.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110723035944/http://psych.mcmaster.ca/maurerlab/Publications/Maurer_bouba.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect does not occur in all communities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogers|first=S.K.|last2=Ross|first2=A.S.|date=1975|title=A cross-cultural test of the maluma-takete phenomenon|url=|journal=Perception|volume=4|pages=105–106|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it appears that the effect breaks if the sounds do not make licit words in the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Syles|first=Suzy|last2=Gawne|first2=Lauren|date=2017|title=When Does Maluma/Takete Fail?

The effect has also been shown to emerge when the words to be paired are existing first names, suggesting that some familiarity with the linguistic stimuli does not eliminate the effect. A study showed that individuals will pair names such as "Molly" with round silhouettes, and names such as "Kate" with sharp silhouettes. Moreover, individuals will associate different personality traits with either group of names (''e.g.'', easygoingness with "round names"; determination with "sharp names"). This may hint at a role of abstract concepts in the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sidhu|first=David M.|last2=Pexman|first2=Penny M.|date=2015-05-27|title=What’s in a Name?

Ramachandran and Hubbard suggest that the kiki/bouba effect has implications for the evolution of language, because it suggests that the naming of objects is not completely arbitrary.&lt;ref name = "Rama2001" /&gt;{{rp|17}} The rounded shape may most commonly be named "bouba" because the mouth makes a more rounded shape to produce that sound while a more taut, angular mouth shape is needed to make the sound "kiki".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=D’Onofrio|first1=Annette|title=Phonetic Detail and Dimensionality in Sound-shape Correspondences: Refining the ''Bouba-Kiki'' Paradigm|journal=Language and Speech|date=15 November 2013|volume=57|issue=3|pages=367–393|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1020.1352&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the distinction may be between [[Coronal consonant|coronal]] or [[Dorsal consonant|dorsal]] consonants like [[Voiceless velar stop|/k/]] and [[Labial consonant|labial]] consonants like [[Voiced bilabial stop|/b/]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Additionally, it was shown that it is not only different consonants (e.g., voiceless versus voiced) and different vowel qualities (e.g., /a/ versus /i/) that play a role in the effect, but also vowel quantity (long versus short vowels). In one study, participants rated words containing long vowels to refer to longer objects and short vowels to short objects.&lt;ref&gt;Bross, F. (2018). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323749384_Cognitive_associations_between_vowel_length_and_object_size_A_new_feature_contributing_to_a_boubakiki_effect Cognitive associations between vowel length and object size: A new feature contributing to a bouba/kiki effect].

Berlin: Humbold University, 17-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence of these "[[synesthesia]]-like mappings" suggest that this effect might be the neurological basis for [[sound symbolism]], in which sounds are non-arbitrarily mapped to objects and events in the world.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

More recently, research indicated that the effect may be a case of [[ideasthesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Gómez Milán, E., Iborra, O., de Córdoba, M.J., Juárez-Ramos V., Rodríguez Artacho, M.A., Rubio, J.L. (2013) The Kiki-Bouba effect: A case of personification and ideaesthesia. ''The Journal of Consciousness Studies.''  20(1-2): pp. 84-102.&lt;/ref&gt; Ideasthesia (alternative spelling ideaesthesia) is defined as a phenomenon in which activations of concepts (inducers) evoke perception-like experiences (concurrents). The name comes from the Greek ''idea'' and ''aisthesis'', meaning "sensing concepts" or "sensing ideas", and was introduced by Danko Nikolić.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nikolić|first1=Danko|title=Is synaesthesia actually ideaestesia? An inquiry into the nature of the phenomenon|journal=Proceedings of the Third International Congress on Synaesthesia, Science &amp; Art|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Autism|Autistic]] individuals do not show as strong a preference. Individuals without autism agree with the standard result 88% of the time, while individuals with autism agree only 56% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oberman LM, Ramachandran VS | last-author-amp = yes | year = 2008 | title = Preliminary evidence for deficits in multisensory integration in autism spectrum disorders: the mirror neuron hypothesis | journal = Social Neuroscience |volume = 3 | issue = 3-4 | pages = 348–55 | pmid = 18979385 | doi = 10.1080/17470910701563681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28031">'''Buffy studies''' (or '''Buffyology''') is the study of [[Joss Whedon]]'s popular television series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and, to a lesser extent, its spin-off program ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''.  It explores issues related to gender and other philosophical issues as expressed through the content of these shows in the fictional [[Buffyverse]].

[[Neda Ulaby]] of [[NPR]] describes ''Buffy'' as having a "special following among academics, some of whom have staked a claim in what they call 'Buffy Studies'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Neda |last=Ulaby |url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1262180 |title='Buffy Studies' |work= National Public Radio |date= May 13, 2003 |accessdate= February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not widely recognized as a distinct discipline, the term "Buffy studies" is commonly used amongst the academic ''Buffy''-related writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Marianne |last= Cantwell |url= http://refractory.unimelb.edu.au/2004/02/03/collapsing-the-extratextualpassions-and-intensities-of-knowledge-in-buffy-the-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-online-fan-communities-marianne-cantwell |title=Collapsing the Extra/Textual: Passions and Intensities of Knowledge in Buffy the Vampire Slayer Online Fan Communities|work=''Refractory: a Journal of Entertainment Media''|volume=5|date=February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development as academic field==
[[Image:Slayage (Buffyverse).jpg|thumb|Slayage logo]]
The debut of ''Buffy'' (1997–2003) eventually led to the publication of a number of books and hundreds of articles examining the themes of the show from a wide range of disciplinary perspectives including [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], [[theology]] and [[women's studies]]. Since January 2001 ''Slayage: The Online Journal of Buffy Studies'' has published essays on the topic quarterly, and it continues to do so. ''[[Fighting the Forces: What's at Stake in Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' was published in 2002, and since then many more ''Buffy'' books have been published by academic book publishers. There have also been a number of international conferences on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;See: "[https://web.archive.org/web/20030421112944/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/england/2340659.stm Boffins get their teeth into Buffy]", ''BBC'' (18 October 2002). "[http://www.wickedness.net/v1cfp.htm Vampires: Myths and Metaphors of Enduring Evil] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215093849/http://www.wickedness.net/v1cfp.htm |date=2005-12-15 }}" ''Wickedness.net'' (2002). "[http://www.slayage.tv/SCBtVS_Archive/index.htm The Slayage Conference on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Paper Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622232427/http://www.slayage.tv/SCBtVS_Archive/index.htm |date=2006-06-22 }}", ''Slayage.tv'' (2004). These sources report on three conferences respectively: "Blood, Text and Fears" (University of East Anglia, UK, 2002), ''Myths and Metaphors of Enduring Evil'' (Budapest, Hungary, 2003), and "The Slayage Conference" (Nashville, USA, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; "College courses across the globe are devoted to the show, and secondary schools in Australia and New Zealand also provide Buffy classes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20040529/scholars_buffy_040529?s_name=&amp;no_ads= Scholars lecture on 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314015546/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20040529/scholars_buffy_040529?s_name=&amp;no_ads= |date=March 14, 2007 }}, ''Ctv.ca'' (May 29, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The topic can even be undertaken as part of a [[Master's degree]] in Cult Film &amp; TV at [[Brunel University]], [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/weird/article.html?in_article_id=13473&amp;in_page_id=2|title=Study Buffy at university|work=Metro.co.uk|date=May 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly, ''Angel'' is being analyzed alongside its predecessor, e.g. in the 2005 publication, [[Reading Angel: The TV Spin-off With a Soul|''Reading Angel'']].

The creator of ''Buffy'', [[Joss Whedon]], has responded to the scholarly reaction to his series: "I think it's great that the academic community has taken an interest in the show. I think it's always important for academics to study popular culture, even if the thing they are studying is idiotic. If it's successful or made a dent in culture, then it is worthy of study to find out why. Buffy, on the other hand is, I hope, not idiotic. We think very carefully about what we're trying to say emotionally, politically, and even philosophically while we're writing it... it really is, apart from being a pop-culture phenomenon, something that is deeply layered textually episode by episode."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/16/readersopinions/16WHED.html?ex=1198213200&amp;en=292c3c27d77f61ac&amp;ei=5070 |title=10 Questions for... Joss Whedon |work=''[[The New York Times]]''|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=May 16, 2003|accessdate=December 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Third International Slayage Conference on the Whedonverses was held June 5–8, 2008 at [[Henderson State University]] in [[Arkadelphia, Arkansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsu.edu/philosophy/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610010223/http://www.hsu.edu/philosophy/ |archivedate=June 10, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The response to this scholarly attention has had its critics.  Jes Battis, who authored ''[[Blood Relations: Chosen Families in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Angel"|Blood Relations in Buffy and Angel]]'', has stated that study of the Buffyverse "invokes an uneasy combination of enthusiasm and ire", and meets "a certain amount of disdain from within the halls of the academy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jes|last=Battis|title=''[[Blood Relations: Chosen Families in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Angel"]]''|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company''|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|date=June 2005|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of explored themes==

===Gender studies===
*Lorna Jowett, 2005: Sex and The Slayer: A Gender Studies Primer for the Buffy Fan.
*:In this paper, published by Wesleyan University Press, Jowett, senior lecturer in American Studies at The University of Northampton and  Buffy fan, states that ‘Buffy may be “Barbie with a kung-fu grip”, but she is still Barbie’ (p.&amp;nbsp;197).  Jowett identifies the show as being “post-feminist”, while arguing that it fails to challenge gender stereotypes in meaningful ways.  Jowetts book’s first 3 chapters are entitled: Girl Power, Good Girls and Bad Girls, in which Jowett dissects the stereotypes within the female characters that, she argues, are reinforced by the show. The next three chapters are broken into the male stereotypes: Tough men, New Men and Dead Boys. Jowett states that reinforcement of stereotypes exists within the show for male characters as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Annie|last=Potts|url=http://fap.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/17/3/415|title=Review: Lorna Jowett: Sex and the Slayer: A Gender Studies Primer for the Buffy Fan|work=''Feminism &amp; Psychology''|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Los Angeles, California|date=August 1, 2007|accessdate=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Lorna|last=Jowett|url=http://www.upne.com/0-8195-6757-4.html|title=''Sex and The Slayer: A Gender Studies Primer for the Buffy Fan''|publisher=Wesleyan University|location=Middletown, Connecticut|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pop culture studies===
*Dee Amy-Chinn and Milly Williamson, 2005: The Vampire Spike in text and fandom: Unsettling oppositions in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
*:Amy-Chinn, senior lecturer at Oxford Brookes University and Williamson, of Brunel University, focus on a specific character in this paper, Spike, who as argued by the authors, embodies “the simultaneous expression of erotic repulsion and attraction” and a “fear of and desire for the ‘other’”. The authors compare and contrast the character of Spike to the show’s general treatment of sexuality and self.&lt;ref&gt;http://ecs.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/8/3/275&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media studies===
*Rhonda Wilcox, 2005: Why Buffy Matters: The Art of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
*:Why does Buffy Matter?  In this paper Wilcox makes the attempt to bring this television show into perspective for us.  Wilcox says, “It matters because it shows that television can be art, and deserves to be so studied…the depth of the characters, the truth of the stories, the profundity of the themes, and their precise incarnation in language, sound and image – all of these matter.” (Wilcox 419).  While giving in depth details of all of these elements and also drawing on other academic articles about Buffy, Wilcox helps to bring this television series to the same page for all fans interested in Buffy; from those who are a bit unsure about the series all the way to those die hard fans.
*Wilcox, Rhonda &amp; Lavery, David, 2002.  “Fighting the Forces: What’s at Stake for Buffy The Vampire Slayer.”
*:"Fighting the Forces” explores the struggle to create meaning in an impressive example of popular culture, the television series phenomenon “Buffy the Vampire Slayer”. These essays analyze the social and cultural issues implicit in the series and place it in its literary context.  Editors Wilcox and Lavery have opened an intriguing doorway to fans of this show, “Issues of gender, generations, race, class, and violence are treated seriously, through an in-depth analysis of both main characters and sidekicks. Class and race are discussed through a study of Buffy’s and her friends’ relationship with the two "other" slayers, American white trash Faith and Jamaican Kendra.”  Wilcox and Lavery analyze these many concepts while critiquing other scholarly essays such as “God, New Religious Movements, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and “Everything Philosophical About Buffy the Vampire Slayer.”&lt;ref&gt;http://you.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/13/3/269&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family studies===
* Burr, Vivien., and Jarvis, C. Sept. 2007. “Imagining the Family Representations of Alternative Lifestyles in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.”
*:This paper offers studies of the family and how media families affect the views of young people.  Through the television show, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Burr explores the dangers and advantages of non-normative family forms, especially the non-genetic or ‘chosen’ families. (Burr) There is also a focus that Buffy “endorses a non-hierarchical, ‘democratic vision’ of the family. (Giddens, 1992) Also, Buffy can generate ‘interactive social worlds’ that are a main focus of the spreading of new social, familial practices (Plummer, 1995).  Family is viewed in a new and different way through Buffy that leads to such innovations as well in practice and research on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;http://qsw.sagepub.com/content/vol6/issue3/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics===
* Kociemba, David, 2006: “Actually, it explains a ''lot''": Reading the Opening Title Sequences in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.”
*:This paper examines the opening title sequences of the television series in detail, looking at the use of imagery, color, editing, logo, credits, title, and scoring. The opening title sequences of Buffy the Vampire Slayer function as a microcosm of the series itself. They reveal the influence of the creators’ perception of their audience and their own work, the medium’s narrative and artistic conventions, and the media industry’s own practices. They construct the series’ past, shape the viewer’s present experience of the episode, and prepare the way for future narratives. This article won the "Short Mr. Pointy" award for excellence in scholarship in Buffy Studies from the Whedon Studies Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slayageonline.com/essays/slayage22/Kociemba.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025074345/http://www.slayageonline.com/essays/slayage22/Kociemba.htm |archivedate=2009-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Descartes}}
'''Cartesian doubt''' is a form of '''methodological skepticism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; associated with the writings and methodology of [[René Descartes]] (1596{{ndash}}1650).&lt;ref name="Philosophical Glossary"&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20010621215141/http://www.swif.uniba.it/lei/foldop/foldoc.cgi?Cartesian+doubt A Philosophical Glossary]" edited by Justin Leiber, Philosophy Department, University of Houston, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scruton"/&gt; Cartesian doubt is also known as '''Cartesian skepticism''', '''methodic doubt''', '''methodological skepticism''', '''universal doubt''', '''systematic doubt''' or '''hyperbolic doubt'''.

Cartesian doubt is a systematic process of being skeptical about (or doubting) the truth of one's beliefs, which has become a characteristic method in [[philosophy]]. This method of doubt was largely popularized in Western philosophy by René Descartes, who sought to doubt the truth of all his beliefs in order to determine which beliefs he could be certain were true. It is the basis for Descartes' statement, "''[[Cogito ergo sum]]''" ("I think, therefore I am").

Methodological skepticism is distinguished from [[philosophical skepticism]] in that methodological skepticism is an approach that subjects all knowledge claims to scrutiny with the goal of sorting out true from false claims, whereas philosophical skepticism is an approach that questions the possibility of certain knowledge.

== Characteristics ==
Cartesian doubt is methodological. Its purpose is to use doubt as a route to certain knowledge by finding those things which could not be doubted. The fallibility of sense data in particular is a subject of Cartesian doubt.

There are several interpretations as to the objective of Descartes' skepticism. Prominent among these is a [[W:foundationalism|foundationalist]] account which claims that Descartes' skepticism is aimed at eliminating all belief which it is possible to doubt, thus leaving Descartes with only [[basic belief]]s (also known as foundational beliefs). From these indubitable basic beliefs, Descartes then attempts to derive further knowledge. It's an archetypal and significant example that epitomizes the [[Rationalism|Continental Rational]] schools of philosophy.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

== Technique ==
Descartes' method of hyperbolic doubt included:
# accepting only information you know to be true
# breaking down these truths into smaller units
# solving the simple problems first
# making ''complete'' lists of further ''problems''

Hyperbolic doubt means having the tendency to doubt, since it is an extreme or exaggerated form of doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Skirry (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; (Knowledge in the Cartesian sense means to know something beyond not merely all reasonable, but all possible, doubt.) In his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' (1641), Descartes resolved to systematically doubt that any of his beliefs were true, in order to build, from the ground up, a belief system consisting of only certainly true beliefs; his end goal—or a major one, at the least—was to find an undoubtable basis for the sciences. Consider Descartes' opening lines of the ''Meditations'':

{{Quotation | Several years have now elapsed since I first became aware that I had accepted, even from my youth, many false opinions for true, and that consequently what I afterward based on such principles was highly doubtful; and from that time I was convinced of the necessity of undertaking once in my life to rid myself of all the opinions I had adopted, and of commencing anew the work of building from the foundation... | René Descartes | Meditation I'', 1641}}

== Descartes's method ==
René Descartes, the originator of Cartesian doubt, put all beliefs, ideas, thoughts, and matter in doubt. He showed that his grounds, or reasoning, for any knowledge could just as well be false. Sensory experience, the primary mode of knowledge, is often erroneous and therefore must be doubted. For instance, what one is seeing may very well be a [[hallucination]]. There is nothing that proves it cannot be. In short, if there is any way a belief can be disproved, then its grounds are insufficient. From this, Descartes proposed two arguments, the dream and the demon.&lt;ref name="Scruton"&gt;[[Roger Scruton]]. ''Modern Philosophy: An Introduction and Survey''. London: Penguin Books, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The dream argument ===
{{See also|Dream argument}}

Descartes, knowing that the context of our dreams, while possibly unbelievable, are often lifelike, hypothesized that humans can only believe that they are awake. There are no sufficient grounds by which to distinguish a dream experience from a waking experience. For instance, Subject A sits at the computer, typing this article. Just as much evidence exists to indicate that the act of composing this article is reality as there is evidence to demonstrate the opposite. Descartes conceded that we live in a world that can create such ideas as dreams. However, by the end of ''The Meditations'', he concludes that we can distinguish dream from reality at least in retrospect:&lt;ref name="Scruton"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"But when I distinctly see where things come from and where and when they come to me, and when I can connect my perceptions of them with my whole life without a break then I can be certain that when I encounter these things  I am not asleep but awake." &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;— Descartes: Selected Philosophical Writings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6tNxSphqAYkC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=%22But+when+I+distinctly+see+where+things+come+from+and%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5_iRLDxEc-&amp;sig=4qw-RoWL9GPSHQvlI4cgzBEC1pw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjIkbHR9o_dAhUBUK0KHf07DMcQ6AEwAnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22But%20when%20I%20distinctly%20see%20where%20things%20come%20from%20and%22&amp;f=false|title=Descartes: Selected Philosophical Writings|last=Descartes|first=René|date=1988-02-26|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521358125|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The Evil Demon ===

{{Main|Evil demon}}

Descartes reasoned that our very own experience may very well be controlled by an ''evil demon'' of sorts. This demon is as clever and deceitful as he is powerful. He could have created a superficial world that we may think we live in.&lt;ref name="Scruton"/&gt; As a result of this doubt, sometimes termed the Malicious Demon Hypothesis, Descartes found that he was unable to trust even the simplest of his perceptions.

In ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy#Meditation I: Concerning Those Things That Can Be Called into Doubt|Meditation I]]'', Descartes stated that if one were mad, even briefly, the insanity might have driven  man into believing that what we thought was true could be merely our minds deceiving us. He also stated that there could be '[[evil demon|some malicious, powerful, cunning demon]]' that had deceived us, preventing us from judging correctly.

Descartes argued that all his senses were lying and since your senses can easily fool you, his idea of an infinitely powerful being must be true as that idea could have only been put there by an infinitely powerful being which would have no reason to be deceitful to him.

== I think, therefore I am ==

While methodic doubt has a nature, one need not hold that knowledge is impossible in order to apply the method of doubt.  Indeed, Descartes' attempt to apply the method of doubt to the existence of himself spawned the proof of his famous saying, "''[[Cogito, ergo sum]]''" (I think, therefore I am).  That is, Descartes tried to doubt his own existence, but found that even his doubting showed that he existed, since he could not doubt if he did not exist.&lt;ref name="Scruton"/&gt;

The twelve volume '''''Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum''''' is the primary reference work for the study of British satirical prints of the 18th and 19th century.  Most of the content  of the catalogue is now available through the [[British Museum]]'s on-line database.

==Description==
The ''BM Satires'' &lt;ref name="DorothyGeorge"&gt; {{cite book|last1=George| first1=M Dorothy |title=Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum |publisher=The British Museum| date=1870-1954| location=London| url=https://archive.org/stream/catalogueofprint07brituoft/catalogueofprint07brituoft_djvu.tx}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprises twelve volumes compiled between 1870 and 1954 and provides a [[catalogue raisonné]] of the 17,000 odd satirical prints assembled in the 19th century by [[Edward Hawkins (numismatist)|Edward Hawkins,]]&lt;Ref name="hawkins"&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Hawkins (British Museum Biographical details)| url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=51568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keeper of Antiquities in the [[British Museum]] from his own and other collections.

It includes works by all the leading artists and makers of satirical prints of the period, as well as lesser known and anonymous designers. Notable artists represented include:   [[Henry Alken]], [[Samuel Alken]], [[William Austin (caricaturist)|William Austin]], [[James Bretherton (artist)|James Bretherton]], [[Charles Bretherton]], [[Henry William Bunbury]],  [[Frederick George Byron]],  [[John Cawse]],  [[John Collett (artist)| John Collet]], [[Thomas Colley]], [[George Cruikshank]], [[Isaac Cruikshank]],  [[Robert Cruikshank]], [[Matthew Darly]],  [[William Dickinson (engraver)|William Dickinson]],  [[Robert Dighton]], [[John Dighton]], [[John Doyle (artist)|John Doyle]], [[William Elmes]], [[Francis Jukes]], [[James Gillray]], [[Henry Heath (artist)|Henry Heath]], [[William Heath (artist)|William Heath]], [[John Kay (caricaturist)|John Kay]], [[John Leech (caricaturist)| John Leech]], [[Lewis Marks]],  [[Richard Newton (caricaturist)|Richard Newton]], [[Piercy Roberts]],  [[Thomas Rowlandson]],  [[F.Sansom]], [[James Sayers]],  [[John Raphael Smith]], [[C.Starck]],  [[Edward Topham]],  [[Henry Wigstead]],  [[Samuel de Wilde]], [[Charles Williams (caricaturist)|Charles Williams]], and  [[George Moutard Woodward |George "Moutard" Woodward]]. Some works by foreign printmakers are also included.

The catalogue allocates a unique identifier to each print which is widely used as a bibliographic reference to specific caricatures in books about caricatures and in sales catalogues. The identifiers are one to five digit numbers, allocated in sequential order of listing within the whole sequence of volumes, each volume covering a monotonically increasing range of numbers. For example; '''BM Satires 10101''' refers to a print listed in Volume VIII (which covers the range 9693 to 11703) that was published in September 1803, titled ''My Ass in a Band Box''. For each print, the catalogue provides a title, publisher, designer and creator if known, image description, lettering and inscriptions, dimensions,  bibliographic references,  and explanatory notes about the historical context and personages and printmaking technique (e.g. [[etching]], [[aquatint]], [[stipple]], hand-coloured, etc.).   The prints are for the most part in historical order of date of publication, though some appear out of chronological order  in  addenda that appear in later volumes. Within each year, Political and Social satire is arranged separately and sequentially.

There is a prefatory essay to each volume by the editor giving a  historical synopsis of printmaking, artists, publishers and events through the period covered by the volume;  including [[Rudolph Ackermann]], [[Bowles &amp; Carver]], [[Thomas Cornell (publisher) | Thomas Cornell]], [[Elizabeth D'Archeray]], [[John Fairburn]],  [[Samuel William Fores]],  [[William Holland (publisher)| William Holland]], [[Hannah Humphrey]], [[ William_Humphrey (engraver)| William Humphrey]], [[Elizabeth Jackson (publisher) |Elizabeth Jackson]], [[John Kay (caricaturist)|John Kay]], [[Thomas Maclean (publisher) | Thomas Maclean]], [[John Raphael Smith]], [[Susan Vivares]] and many others.

==History==
The first five volume of the catalogue were compiled under [[Frederic George Stephens]] between 1870 and 1883, with the assistance of Edward Hawkins, Keeper of Antiquities for the [[British Museum]]. The last seven volumes were the magnum opus of [[Mary Dorothy George]] the distinguished historian of British satire.  In 2008&amp;ndash;12, as part of the British Museum's program to digitalise its collections, all the volumes were scanned and used to form the basis of the entries for the satirical prints in the [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx British Museum on-line catalogue].  Digital images are now available for most of the prints.

The '''cloud drop effective radius''' (alternatively '''cloud effective radius''' or '''effective radius''') is a [[weighted mean]] of the size distribution of cloud droplets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/PIP/shtml/cloud_effective_radius.shtml |title=Cloud Effective Radius |work=Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center |accessdate=3 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724155507/http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/PIP/shtml/cloud_effective_radius.shtml |archivedate=24 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was defined in 1974 by [[James E. Hansen]] and [[Larry Travis]] as the ratio of the third to the second [[moment (mathematics)|moment]] of a droplet size distribution to aid in the [[inverse problem|inversion]] of [[remote sensing|remotely sensed]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hansen., J.E. and L.D. Travis |title=Light scattering in planetary atmospheres |journal=[[Space Science Reviews]] |volume=16 |issue =4 |year=1974 |doi=10.1007/BF00168069 |pages=527–610 |bibcode=1974SSRv...16..527H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physically, it is an area weighted radius of the cloud drop particles.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as
&lt;math&gt;r_e = \dfrac{\int\limits_{0}^{\infty} \pi \cdot r^3 \cdot n(r)\,dr}{\int\limits_{0}^{\infty} \pi \cdot r^2 \cdot n(r)\,dr}&lt;/math&gt;.

The global effective particle radius has different values for water and ice clouds: the former is around 14 μm, whereas for ice it is around 25 μm. Studies also indicate that the effective cloud droplet radius is larger over oceans than over ground by 15%-20%. By contrast, the difference in the ice particle size over land and oceans is much smaller (only 5%).&lt;ref name = "2013stubenrauch"&gt;

The '''Comoé National Park Research Station''', located in the [[Comoé National Park]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], was founded by Professor Karl Eduard Linsenmair in 1989/90.

The research station was forced to close after the outbreak of the [[First Ivorian Civil War]] in 2002. After the end of the [[Second Ivorian Civil War]] in 2011 repairs at the station began and in 2014 the station had achieved again its full working capacity. The focus of the field based research is on conservation, tropical ecology and behaviour.

==History==
In 1989/90 a first research camp was realized with substantial funding provided by the Volkswagen Stiftung, the [[University of Würzburg]] and the respective Ministry (Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Bildung und Kultus, Wissenschaft und Kunst). A successful application for a research grant by Linsenmair at the [[Fritz Thyssen Foundation]] led to the expansion and transformation into a permanent station, after various bureaucratic hurdles in [[Germany]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire]], which delayed the construction of the field station approximately 8 years.&lt;ref name="Die Zeit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Habekuss|first1=Fritz|title=Der Patron und sein Paradies|url=http://www.zeit.de/2015/11/elfenbeinkueste-comoe-nationalpark-forschungsstation-savanne|accessdate=29 July 2015|work=Die Zeit|issue=N°11/2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Construction started in 2000 and in early 2002 all guesthouses and other buildings apart from the lab were finished and a move from the camp to the new station was possible.

The outbreak of the [[First Ivorian Civil War]], in September 2002, resulted in the loss of the entire removable and demountable equipment and the closure of the station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Degen|first1=Marieke|title=Civil war leaves Ivory Coast research in tatters|journal=Nature|date=13 February 2003|volume=421|issue=6924|pages=680–680|doi=10.1038/421680b|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6924/full/421680b.html|accessdate=29 July 2015|pmid=12610586}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the positive development in the country after the [[Second Ivorian Civil War]], the rehabilitation of the station started in 2012 with remaining funds from the Fritz Thyssen Foundation and the University of Würzburg. With the construction of the solar plant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coskun|first1=Ayhan|title=36 kWP for Research Station in Ivory Coast|url=http://www.solar23.com/news1.html|website=SOLAR23|publisher=SOLAR23|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in December 2014, the rehabilitation was finished and the station had achieved its full working capacity again,&lt;ref name="Die Zeit"/&gt; making it one of the most modern field research stations in Africa.&lt;ref name="afrika"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frank|first1=Erik|title=Research Station Comoé|url=http://www.afrikazentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/forschung_in_afrika/research_station_comoe/|website=University of Würzburg|publisher=Afrikazentrum|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ziels|first1=Susanne|last2=Linsenmair|first2=Karl Eduard|title=Comoé Research Station|journal=GTÖ Conference 2015|date=7 April 2015|page=Free Session 12-P11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Homepage"/&gt;

==Research==
The Research of the station focuses on various fields of conservation, tropical ecology and behaviour, e.g. ecophysiology, chemical and evolutionary  ecology. In its first 2 decades before the civil war over 20 international research institutions conducted projects at the station with over 100 scientists contributing to the over 200 papers published in peer reviewed journals. Far more students participated in field courses, collecting data for more than 40 diploma, masters, bachelors and Ph.D. theses.&lt;ref name="uni"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Linsenmair|first1=Eduard|title=Tropenforscher kehren zurück|url=http://www.biologie.uni-wuerzburg.de/aktuelles_veranstaltungen/archiv1/single/artikel/tropenfors-1/|website=University of Würzburg|publisher=einBLICK|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Connectionism''' is an approach in the fields of [[cognitive science]], that hopes to explain [[mind|mental]] phenomena using [[artificial neural networks]] (ANN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/connectionism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=James|last=Garson|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=27 November 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Artificial_neural_network.svg|thumb|Connectionist (ANN) model with a hidden layer]]

==Basic principles==
The central connectionist principle is that mental phenomena can be described by interconnected networks of simple and often uniform units. The form of the connections and the units can vary from model to model. For example, units in the network could represent [[neurons]] and the connections could represent [[synapses]], as in the [[human brain]].

===Spreading activation===
{{Main|Spreading activation}}
In most connectionist models, networks change over time.  A closely related and very common aspect of connectionist models is ''activation''. At any time, a unit in the network has an activation, which is a numerical value intended to represent some aspect of the unit.  For example, if the units in the model are neurons, the activation could represent the [[probability]] that the neuron would generate an [[action potential]] spike. Activation typically spreads to all the other units connected to it.  Spreading activation is always a feature of neural network models, and it is very common in connectionist models used by [[cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologists]].

===Neural networks===
{{Main|Artificial neural networks}}
Neural networks are by far the most commonly used connectionist model today. Though there are a large variety of neural network models, they almost always follow two basic principles regarding the mind:

# Any mental state can be described as an (N)-dimensional [[Vector (mathematics)|vector]] of numeric activation values over neural units in a network.
# Memory is created by modifying the strength of the connections between neural units. The connection strengths, or "weights", are generally represented as an N×N [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].

Most of the variety among neural network models comes from:
* ''Interpretation of units'': Units can be interpreted as neurons or groups of neurons.
* ''Definition of activation'': Activation can be defined in a variety of ways. For example, in a [[Boltzmann machine]], the activation is interpreted as the [[probability]] of generating an action potential spike, and is determined via a [[logistic function]] on the sum of the inputs to a unit.
* ''Learning algorithm'': Different networks modify their connections differently. In general, any mathematically defined change in connection weights over time is referred to as the "learning algorithm".

Connectionists are in agreement that [[recurrent neural networks]] (directed networks wherein connections of the network can form a directed cycle) are a better model of the brain than [[feedforward neural networks]] (directed networks with no cycles, called [[Directed acyclic graph|DAG]]). Many recurrent connectionist models also incorporate [[dynamical systems theory]]. Many researchers, such as the connectionist [[Paul Smolensky]], have argued that connectionist models will evolve toward fully [[Continuous function|continuous]], high-dimensional, [[non-linear]], [[dynamic systems]] approaches.

===Biological realism===
Connectionist work in general does not need to be biologically realistic and therefore suffers from a lack of neuroscientific plausibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encephalos.gr/48-1-01e.htm|title=Encephalos Journal|website=www.encephalos.gr|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-OCCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT18&amp;lpg=PT18&amp;dq=%22accurate%22&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q=%22accurate%22&amp;f=false|title=Neural Geographies: Feminism and the Microstructure of Cognition|last=Wilson|first=Elizabeth A.|date=2016-02-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317958765|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e953/59bc80e624a963a3d8c943e3b2898a397ef7.pdf|title=Organismically-inspired robotics: homeostatic adaptation and teleology beyond the closed sensorimotor loop|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zorzi|first=Marco|last2=Testolin|first2=Alberto|last3=Stoianov|first3=Ivilin P.|date=2013-08-20|title=Modeling language and cognition with deep unsupervised learning: a tutorial overview|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00515|issn=1664-1078|pmc=3747356|pmid=23970869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&amp;context=comparativephilosophy|title=ANALYTIC AND CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uV9TZzOITMwC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=%22biological%20plausibility%22&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q=%22biological%20plausibility%22&amp;f=false|title=Neural Network Perspectives on Cognition and Adaptive Robotics|last=Browne|first=A.|date=1997-01-01|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780750304559|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pPv0STSos8C&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=%22biological+realism%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22biological%20realism%22&amp;f=false|title=Connectionism in Perspective|last=Pfeifer|first=R.|last2=Schreter|first2=Z.|last3=Fogelman-Soulié|first3=F.|last4=Steels|first4=L.|date=1989-08-23|publisher=Elsevier|year=|isbn=9780444598769|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning===
The weights in a neural network are adjusted according to some [[learning rule]] or algorithm, such as [[Hebbian theory|Hebbian learning]]. Thus, connectionists have created many sophisticated learning procedures for neural networks. Learning always involves modifying the connection weights. In general, these involve mathematical formulas to determine the change in weights when given sets of data consisting of activation vectors for some subset of the neural units. Several studies have been focused on designing teaching-learning methods based on connectionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Novo|first=María-Luisa|last2=Alsina|first2=Ángel|last3=Marbán|first3=José-María|last4=Berciano|first4=Ainhoa|date=2017|title=Connective Intelligence for Childhood Mathematics Education|url=https://doi.org/10.3916/C52-2017-03|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=25|issue=52|pages=29–39|doi=10.3916/c52-2017-03|issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By formalizing learning in such a way, connectionists have many tools. A very common strategy in connectionist learning methods is to incorporate [[gradient descent]] over an error surface in a space defined by the weight matrix. All gradient descent learning in connectionist models involves changing each weight by the [[partial derivative]] of the error surface with respect to the weight. [[Backpropagation]] (BP), first made popular in the 1980s, is probably the most commonly known connectionist gradient descent algorithm today.

==History==

Connectionism can be traced to ideas more than a century old, which were little more than speculation until the mid-to-late 20th century.

===Parallel distributed processing===

The prevailing connectionist approach today was originally known as '''parallel distributed processing''' (PDP). It was an [[artificial neural network]] approach that stressed the parallel nature of neural processing, and the distributed nature of neural representations.  It provided a general mathematical framework for researchers to operate in. The framework involved eight major aspects:

* A set of ''processing units'', represented by a [[set (computer science)|set]] of integers.
* An ''activation'' for each unit, represented by a vector of time-dependent [[Function (mathematics)|functions]].
* An ''output function'' for each unit, represented by a vector of functions on the activations.
* A ''pattern of connectivity'' among units, represented by a matrix of real numbers indicating connection strength.
* A ''propagation rule'' spreading the activations via the connections, represented by a function on the output of the units.
* An ''activation rule'' for combining inputs to a unit to determine its new activation, represented by a function on the current activation and propagation.
* A ''[[learning rule]]'' for modifying connections based on experience, represented by a change in the weights based on any number of variables.
* An ''environment'' that provides the system with experience, represented by sets of activation vectors for some [[subset]] of the units.

A lot of the research that led to the development of PDP was done in the 1970s, but PDP became popular in the 1980s with the release of the books ''Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition - Volume 1 (foundations)'' and ''Volume 2 (Psychological and Biological Models)'', by [[James L. McClelland]], [[David E. Rumelhart]] and the PDP Research Group. The books are now considered seminal connectionist works, and it is now common to fully equate PDP and connectionism, although the term "connectionism" is not used in the books.

===Earlier work===
PDP's direct roots were the [[perceptron]] theories of researchers such as [[Frank Rosenblatt]] from the 1950s and 1960s. But perceptron models were made very unpopular by the book ''Perceptrons'' by [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]], published in 1969. It demonstrated the limits on the sorts of functions that single-layered (no hidden layer) perceptrons can calculate, showing that even simple functions like the [[exclusive disjunction]] (XOR) could not be handled properly. The PDP books overcame this limitation by showing that multi-level, non-linear neural networks were far more robust and could be used for a vast array of functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0893-6080(89)90020-8| title = Multilayer feedforward networks are universal approximators| journal = Neural Networks| volume = 2| issue = 5| pages = 359| year = 1989| last1 = Hornik | first1 = K. | last2 = Stinchcombe | first2 = M. | last3 = White | first3 = H. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many earlier researchers advocated connectionist style models, for example in the 1940s and 1950s, [[Warren McCulloch]] and [[Walter Pitts]] ([[Artificial neuron|MP neuron]]), [[Donald Olding Hebb]], and [[Karl Lashley]]. McCulloch and Pitts showed how neural systems could implement [[first-order logic]]: Their classic paper "A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity" (1943) is important in this development here. They were influenced by the important work of [[Nicolas Rashevsky]] in the 1930s.  Hebb contributed greatly to speculations about neural functioning, and proposed a learning principle, [[Hebbian learning]], that is still used today. Lashley argued for distributed representations as a result of his failure to find anything like a localized [[Engram (neuropsychology)|engram]] in years of [[lesion]] experiments.

===Connectionism apart from PDP===
Though PDP is the dominant form of connectionism, other theoretical work should also be classified as connectionist.

Many connectionist principles can be traced to early work in [[psychology]], such as that of [[William James]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anderson  |first1= James A.|last2=Rosenfeld |first2= Edward |date= 1989|title= Neurocomputing: Foundations of Research|url= |location= |publisher= A Bradford Book |page= 1|chapter = Chapter 1: (1890) William James ''Psychology (Brief Course)'' |isbn=978-0262510486 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological theories based on knowledge about the human brain were fashionable in the late 19th century.  As early as 1869, the neurologist [[John Hughlings Jackson]] argued for multi-level, distributed systems. Following from this lead, [[Herbert Spencer]]'s ''Principles of Psychology'', 3rd edition (1872), and [[Sigmund Freud]]'s ''Project for a Scientific Psychology'' (composed 1895) propounded connectionist or proto-connectionist theories. These tended to be speculative theories. But by the early 20th century, [[Edward Thorndike]] was experimenting on learning that posited a connectionist type network.

In the 1950s, [[Friedrich Hayek]] proposed that spontaneous order in the brain arose out of decentralized networks of simple units{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Hayek's work was rarely cited in the PDP literature until recently{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}.

Another form of connectionist model was the [[Stratificational linguistics|relational network]] framework developed by the [[linguist]] [[Sydney Lamb]] in the 1960s. Relational networks have been only used by linguists, and were never unified with the PDP approach. As a result, they are now used by very few researchers.

There are also hybrid connectionist models, mostly mixing symbolic representations with neural network models.
The hybrid approach has been advocated by some researchers (such as [[Ron Sun]]).

==Connectionism vs. computationalism debate==
As connectionism became increasingly popular in the late 1980s, some researchers (including [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Steven Pinker]] and others) reacted against it.  They argued that connectionism, as then developing, threatened to obliterate what they saw as the progress being made in the fields of cognitive science and psychology by the classical approach of [[computationalism]]. Computationalism is a specific form of cognitivism that argues that mental activity is [[Computing|computational]], that is, that the mind operates by performing purely formal operations on symbols, like a [[Turing machine]].  Some researchers argued that the trend in connectionism represented a reversion toward [[associationism]] and the abandonment of the idea of a [[language of thought]], something they saw as mistaken. In contrast, those very tendencies made connectionism attractive for other researchers.

Connectionism and computationalism need not be at odds, but the debate in the late 1980s and early 1990s led to opposition between the two approaches.  Throughout the debate, some researchers have argued that connectionism and computationalism are fully compatible, though full consensus on this issue has not been reached.  Differences between the two approaches include the following:

* Computationalists posit symbolic models that are structurally similar to underlying brain structure, whereas connectionists engage in "low-level" modeling, trying to ensure that their models resemble neurological structures.
* Computationalists in general focus on the structure of explicit symbols ([[mental models]]) and [[syntactical]] rules for their internal manipulation, whereas connectionists focus on learning from environmental stimuli and storing this information in a form of connections between neurons.
* Computationalists believe that internal mental activity consists of manipulation of explicit symbols, whereas connectionists believe that the manipulation of explicit symbols provides a poor model of mental activity.
* Computationalists often posit [[domain specificity|domain specific]] symbolic sub-systems designed to support learning in specific areas of cognition (e.g., language, intentionality, number), whereas connectionists posit one or a small set of very general learning-mechanisms.

Despite these differences, some theorists have proposed that the connectionist architecture is simply the manner in which organic brains happen to implement the symbol-manipulation system. This is logically possible, as it is well known that connectionist models can implement symbol-manipulation systems of the kind used in computationalist models,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} as indeed they must be able if they are to explain the human ability to perform symbol-manipulation tasks. But the debate rests on whether this symbol manipulation forms the foundation of cognition in general, so this is not a potential vindication of computationalism. Nonetheless, computational descriptions may be helpful high-level descriptions of cognition of logic, for example.

The debate largely centred on logical arguments about whether connectionist networks could produce the syntactic structure observed in this sort of reasoning. This was later achieved,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} although using processes unlikely to be possible in the brain,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} thus the debate persisted. {{As of | 2016}}, progress in neurophysiology and general advances in the understanding of neural networks have led to the successful modelling of a great many of these early problems, and the debate about fundamental cognition has, thus, largely been decided among neuroscientists in favour of connectionism.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} However, these fairly recent developments have yet to reach consensus acceptance among those working in other fields, such as psychology or philosophy of mind.

Part of the appeal of computational descriptions is that they are relatively easy to interpret, and thus may be seen as contributing to our understanding of particular mental processes, whereas connectionist models are in general more opaque, to the extent that they may be describable only in very general terms (such as specifying the learning algorithm, the number of units, etc.), or in unhelpfully low-level terms. In this sense connectionist models may instantiate, and thereby provide evidence for, a broad theory of cognition (i.e., connectionism), without representing a helpful theory of the particular process that is being modelled. In this sense the debate might be considered as to some extent reflecting a mere difference in the level of analysis in which particular theories are framed.

The recent{{when|date=February 2016}} popularity of [[Cognitive Model#Dynamical systems|dynamical systems]] in [[philosophy of mind]] have added a new perspective on the debate; some authors{{which|date=February 2016}} now argue that any split between connectionism and computationalism is more conclusively characterized as a split between computationalism and [[Cognitive Model#Dynamical systems|dynamical systems]].

In 2014, [[Alex Graves (computer scientist)|Alex Graves]] and others from [[DeepMind]] published a series of papers describing a novel Deep Neural Network structure called the [[Neural Turing Machine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Graves|first1=Alex|title=Neural Turing Machines|arxiv=1410.5401}}&lt;/ref&gt; able to read symbols on a tape and store symbols in memory. Relational Networks, another Deep Network module published by DeepMind are able to create object-like representations and manipulate them to answer complex questions. Relational Networks and Neural Turing Machines are further evidence that connectionism and computationalism need not be at odds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39340">In 1975 the Japanese government added a new chapter to the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties (1950) to provide for "traditional techniques or craftsmanship that are indispensable to the preservation of cultural property and for which preservation measures shall be taken". Preservation techniques are selected in relation to both [[Tangible Cultural Properties of Japan|tangible]] and [[Intangible Cultural Properties of Japan|intangible]] cultural properties and a holder or preservation body is recognized for each technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/natlaws/media/pdf/japan/japan_law_protectionproperty_entno.pdf |title=Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties (1950, last amendment 2007) |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunkachō"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/pdf/h21_chapter_06.pdf |title=Preservation and Utilization of Cultural Properties |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |page=41 |accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Larsen"&gt;{{cite book |title=Architectural Preservation in Japan |author=Larsen, Knut Einar |publisher=[[ICOMOS]] International Wood Committee |year=1994 |pages=40f |ISBN=82-519-1432-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In support of the {{nihongo|Selected Conservation Techniques|選定保存技術}}, the government provides funding for and conducts programmes relating to documentation, training, development, promotion and public education. Recognition is thus made and measures taken to combat some of the most serious conservation issues, namely the lack of specialist craftsmen, the loss of knowledge of traditional techniques, and the availability of suitable tools and materials. These issues are of particular relevance in Japan due to the sophistication and inherent susceptibility of much of its art and architecture.&lt;ref name="Bunkachō"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larsen"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9988">The '''Creative Energy Homes'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/creative-energy-homes/index.aspx|publisher=The University of Nottingham|title=Creative Energy Homes project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (CEH) project is a showcase of innovative state-of-the-art energy-efficient homes of the future. Seven homes constructed on the [[Campuses of the University of Nottingham#University Park Campus|University Park Campus]] of the [[University of Nottingham]] are being designed and constructed to various degrees of innovation and flexibility to allow the testing of different aspects of modern methods of construction including layout and form, cladding materials, roof structures, foundations, glazing materials, thermal performance, building services systems, sustainable/[[renewable energy]] technologies, lighting systems, acoustics and water supply. The project aims to stimulate sustainable design ideas and promote new ways of providing affordable, environmentally sustainable housing that are innovative in their design. The homes are fully instrumented and occupied in order to provide comprehensive post occupancy evaluation data.

== The David Wilson House ==
[[File:CEH DavidWilsonHouse.jpg|thumb|left|The David Wilson Ecohouse]] Construction of the CEH project began in 1999 with the David Wilson Ecohouse.
This is a 4-bedroom detached property which uses brick and block construction. Its main purpose was to support research into domestic-sized renewable energy systems such as micro-CHP ([[Combined heat and power]]), [[solar thermal]], micro-wind, [[Light tube|sun pipes]], and natural ventilation devices.

The house is currently used as office space for University of Nottingham staff and continues to be used as a test bed for University research projects.

== The BASF House ==
The [http://www.house.basf.co.uk/ BASF house] was the 3rd house to be constructed and was completed in January 2008 taking only 25 weeks to build. The house was designed by Derek Trowell Architects [http://derektrowellarchitects.co.uk/basf-house/] to demonstrate that it is possible to build an affordable low energy house whilst still adherering to the [[Passivhaus]] ideology. It meets the level 4 standard of the [[Code for Sustainable Homes]].

The house has a compact floor area and relies as much as possible on passive solar design to keep costs down. The north, east and west walls are highly insulated, with the minimum number of openings compatible with acceptable day lighting standards. The southern elevation consists of a fully glazed two-layer adjustable sunspace with glazed screens that can be opened or closed to facilitate heating or cooling.

A [[Ground-coupled heat exchanger|ground-air heat exchanger]], supplied by [http://www.rehau.co.uk/ Rehau], lies to the front of the house and this consists of a network of horizontal pipes buried approximately 2m underground. At this depth the soil temperature only varies between 8-12°C throughout the year. Therefore in winter cold air can be pre-heated before being drawn into the house and in the summer the air can be cooled.

A [[rainwater harvesting]] system has also been installed, which consists of a 3500 litres tank buried under the car parking space. It collects the run-off water from the roof. This water can be used for washing clothes, watering the garden, flushing the toilet and general cleaning. Water efficiency is also an important factor of the code for sustainable homes and using a rainwater harvesting system drastically reduces the amount of mains water used per person per day.

The [[Passive solar building design|sun space]], at the front of the house captures the solar gain from the sun, heating the air for use in the rest of the house. The south facing elevation is almost 100% glazed and the north facing elevation 30% glazed, providing improved quality of life in the home by maximising the use of natural daylight and reducing the energy required to light the home.

On the roof of the house are 3 solar thermal panels used for hot water heating. This is a larger system than is typical for this size of house, which allows storage of hot water for as long as 3 days and helps compensate for extended periods of overcast conditions.

== The E.ON 2016 House ==
The [http://www.eon-uk.com/about/2016house.aspx E.ON House] is a replica 1930s UK semi-detached house built primarily to research the impact of various retrofitting solutions on the existing housing stock.

According to the [[Code for Sustainable Homes]] (CfSH) all the new houses built from 2016 are required to meet Level 6 requirements of the CfSH, or be carbon zero. However, it is estimated that by the year 2050, 25 million existing UK homes will still account for between 70 and 90 percent of the housing stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Existing Housing and Climate Change|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmcomloc/432/432i.pdf|publisher=House of Commons|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 25% of UK CO2 emissions derive from the domestic housing stock&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Firth|first=Steven|title=Investigating CO2 emissions reduction in existing urban housing using a community domestic energy model|url=http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2009/BS09_2098_2105.pdf|work=Proceedings of the Eleventh International IBPSA Conference|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; so clearly there is a large opportunity to reduce UK carbon emissions by increasing the efficiency of existing homes.

The house is built to 1930s building regulations and the project developers had to receive special planning permission in order to construct the house. It has no roof or wall cavity insulation and uses single glazed windows. Hot water is provided by an outdated, inefficient non-condensing gas boiler and immersion heater. The plan is to bring this 1930s house to a top of the range home meeting Level 6 CfSH. It is hoped that the lessons learnt from this detailed research will help point the way to retrofitting homes to create more sustainable properties. The project consists of three phases:

# During the first phase the house was monitored in its original state. There are over 100 sensors positioned around the house monitoring temperature, relative humidity, electricity consumption of individual appliances, gas consumption, water consumption, total electricity consumption and occupancy.
# The second phase was carried out from August 2010 to June 2011. The building was upgraded with additional insulation, an improved heating system, double glazing, more efficient lighting and drought proofing. Research was carried out as to the impact of these improvements.
# In the third phase, due to begin in late 2011, further improvements will be made incorporating the installation of a conservatory-style extension creating a buffer zone between the property and the outside elements and a sun space to maximise solar gain. Renewable energy technologies, such as [[Photovoltaic panels|Solar panel]]  and solar hot water system will also be installed in order to supply the house with electricity and hot water.

== The Tarmac Homes ==
Tarmac have sponsored the construction of two semi-detached eco-homes called [http://www.tarmachomesproject.co.uk/ Tarmac House]. These are designed by [http://www.zedfactory.com/ ZEDfactory], the company responsible for the [[BEDZED]] project in south London. One home is built to Level 4 CfSH  and the other to Level 6 CfSH.

These houses demonstrate that it is possible to build a sustainable home using currently available materials and traditional methods of construction. Sustainability features of the properties include:

* Extremely well insulated walls with 250&amp;nbsp;mm of [[cavity wall insulation]].
* A [[Biomass heating system]] situated in front of the houses.
* A [[Solar water heating]] system with roof-mounted solar panels.
* [http://solarcentury.com/ Solar century] sun slates on the level 6 house helping to meet electricity demands.

== The Nottingham H.O.U.S.E (Home Optimising the Use of Solar Energy) ==
[http://www.nottinghamhouse.co.uk/ Nottingham H.O.U.S.E] is a small family "starter" home, which was built as a part of a [[Solar Decathlon Europe]] 2010 event by the students of the [http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/engineering/Departments/abe/index.aspx Department of Architecture and Built Environment]. The house delivers a zero carbon sustainable design solution that is compliant with level 6 of UK's Code for Sustainable Homes. It is a prefabricated two storey house with a courtyard garden that can be used in terrace or semi-detached form.

The House was presented at the [http://www.ecobuild.co.uk/ Ecobuild] 2010 event and awarded with the prize for the best use of timber. The models of the house were also presented at the [[Expo 2010|Shanghai Expo 2010]]. The prefabricated house is due to be moved on to the University Park campus of the University of Nottingham in the near future.

== The Mark Group House ==
The Mark Group house is currently under construction.  It is a 4-bedroom property constructed using a steel framing system with insulation cladding. Construction of the basement uses an [[Insulating concrete form|Insulating Concrete Form]] (ICF) which incorporates [[Ground granulated blast furnace slag|Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag]] (GGBS) into the [[Portland cement]].

Manufacturing Portland cement produces around 1 tonne of CO2 per tonne of concrete whereas GGBS, as a by-product of the iron industry, produces only 0.1 tonnes of CO2 per tonne{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. GGBS can be mixed with Portland cement 70%-30% to decrease its carbon footprint by around 40%{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}.

[[File:Carbonyl oxide (Criegee zwitterion).svg|thumb|Criegee [[zwitterion]]]]

A '''Criegee intermediate''' (also called a '''Criegee [[zwitterion]]''' or '''Criegee [[biradical]]''') is a [[carbonyl]] [[oxide]] with two charge centres. These [[molecules]] help to break down [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[nitrogen dioxide]] in the atmosphere, and may help offset [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Oliver |last1= Welz |first2= John D. |last2= Savee |first3= David L. |last3= Osborn |first4= Subith S. |last4= Vasu |first5= Carl J. |last5= Percival |first6= Dudley E. |last6= Shallcross |first7= Craig A. |last7= Taatjes |title= Direct Kinetic Measurements of Criegee Intermediate (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OO) Formed by Reaction of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; |journal= Science |date= 13 January 2012 |volume= 335 |issue= 6065 |pages= 204–207 |doi= 10.1126/science.1213229 |bibcode = 2012Sci...335..204W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MSNBC&gt;{{cite news| last=Castro| first=Joseph| title=How mysterious molecules may help cool Earth|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45975663/ns/technology_and_science-science/#.TxCB1PmGmSo|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|accessdate=2012-01-12 |date= January 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of this sort of structure was first postulated in the 1950s by [[Rudolf Criegee]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/120112142232.htm | title= Offsetting Global Warming: Molecule in Earth's Atmosphere Could 'Cool the Planet' | date= January 12, 2012| publisher= [[Science Daily]] | accessdate= 2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; for whom it is named, but it was not until 2013 that direct detection of such chemicals was reported. [[Infrared spectroscopy]] suggests the [[electronic structure]] is a [[zwitterion]] rather than a [[biradical]] as some had proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Infrared Absorption Spectrum of the Simplest Criegee Intermediate CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OO |journal= Science |date= 12 April 2013 |volume= 340 |issue= 6129 |pages= 174–176 |doi= 10.1126/science.1234369 |last1= Su |first1= Yu-Te |last2= Huang |first2= Yu-Hsuan |first3= Witek |last3= Henryk A. |last4= Lee |first4= Yuan-Pern |bibcode = 2013Sci...340..174S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Decentralized wastewater systems''' (also referred to as '''decentralized wastewater treatment systems''') convey, treat and dispose or reuse [[wastewater]] from small communities, buildings and dwellings in remote areas, individual public or private properties. [[Wastewater]] flow is generated when appropriate water supply is available within the buildings or close to them.

Decentralized wastewater systems treat, reuse or dispose the effluent in relatively close vicinity to its source of generation. They have the purpose to protect [[public health]] and the [[natural environment]] by reducing substantially health and environmental hazards.

They are also referred as "decentralized wastewater treatment systems" because the main technical challenge is the adequate choice of a treatment and/or disposal facility.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wastewatereducation.org/watertowaste/epa_septic_program_strategy.pdf|title=Decentralized wastewater systems: a program strategy, EPA, Washington DC, USA|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.borda-sea.org/basic-needs-services/dewats-decentralized-wastewater-treatment.html|title=DEWATS/Decentralized wastewater treatment, BORDA, South-east Asia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commonly used acronym for decentralized wastewater treatment system, is DEWATS.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Background ==

=== Comparison to centralized systems ===
Centralized wastewater systems are the most widely applied in well-developed urban environments and the oldest approach to the solution of the problems associated with wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;Karman D. (2007) [http://www3.iath.virginia.edu/waters/article.html The 'Cloaka Maxima' and the monumental manipulation of water in archaic Rome], On-line journal ''&amp;nbsp;The Water of Rome,'' retrieved on the 18 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;They collect wastewater in large and bulk pipeline networks, also referred as [[sewerage]], which transport it at long distances to one or several treatment plants.  [[Stormwater|Storm water]] can be collected in either [[combined sewer]]s or in a separate storm water drains.  The latter consists of two separate pipeline systems, one for the wastewater and one for the storm water. The treated effluent is disposed in different ways, most often discharged into natural water bodies. The treated effluent may also be used for beneficial purposes and in this case it is referred as [[reclaimed water]].

The main difference between decentralized and centralized systems is in the conveyance structure. In decentralized systems the treatment and disposal or reuse of the effluent is close to the source of generation. This results in a small conveyance network, in some cases limited only to one pipeline. The size of the network allows for applications of different conveyance methods, in addition to the well-known gravity sewers, such as pressurized sewers and [[vacuum sewer]]s. The quantity of the effluent is low and is characterized by significant fluctuations.

=== Applications ===
In locations with developed infrastructure, decentralized wastewater systems could be a viable alternative of the conventional centralized system, especially in cases of upgrading or retrofitting existing systems.&lt;ref name="Leverenz" /&gt; Many different combinations and variations of ''hybrid'' systems are possible. The development of new treatment technologies allows for decentralized solutions, which are technically and aesthetically sound and acceptable.

Decentralized applications are a necessity in cases of new urban developments, where the construction of the infrastructure is not ready or will be executed in future. In many countries and locations, the infrastructure development (roads, water supply and especially wastewater/drainage systems) is executed years after the housing development. In such cases decentralized wastewater facilities are considered as a temporary solution, but they are mandatory, in order to prevent public health and ecological problems.

Decentralized systems allow for flow separation or source separation, which segregates different types of wastewater, based on their origin, such as: [[Blackwater (waste)|black water]], [[greywater]] and [[urine]].&lt;ref name="Leverenz"&gt;Tchobanoglous G., Leverenz H. (2013) The rationale for decentralization of wastewater infrastructure, in: [https://books.google.bg/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=juicry4LaRgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=decentralized+wastewater+systems&amp;ots=CHVe6w98Wu&amp;sig=VvTMLtDYXrW60pGHm0xKI_HTpPs&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=decentralized%20wastewater%20systems&amp;f=false Source separation and decentralization for wastewater management], ed: Larsen T.A., Udert K.M., Lienert J., ''IWA publishing'', London, UK&lt;/ref&gt; This approach requires separate parallel pipeline/plumbing systems to convey the segregated flows and the purpose is to apply different level of treatment and handling of each flow and to enhance the safe reuse and disposal of the end products.&lt;ref&gt;WHO (2006). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1004 WHO Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Grey water] . World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

In the specific case of [[Developing country|developing countries]], where localities with poor infrastructure are common, decentralized wastewater treatment has been promoted extensively because of the possibility to apply technologies with low operation and maintenance requirements.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Sasse, L. (1998). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1933 DEWATS Decentralised Wastewater Treatment in Developing Countries]. Bremen Overseas Research and Development Association (BORDA), Germany&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, decentralized approaches require smaller scale investments, compared to centralized solutions.

== Types ==
[[File:Torvetua eco-village (3254898889).jpg|thumb|Decentralized wastewater system in Torvetua eco-village in [[Norway]]. Wastewater is collected by a [[vacuum sewer]]. [[Greywater]] is treated locally.]]
Based on the size of the served area, different scales of decentralization could be found:
* Decentralization at the level of a suburb or satellite township in an urban area – these systems could be defined as small centralized systems when applied to small towns or rural communities. But if they are applied only to selected suburbs or districts in medium or large population centres, with existing centralized system,&amp;nbsp;the whole system could be defined as a ''hybrid'' system, where decentralization is applied to parts of the whole drained area.&lt;ref name="Leverenz" /&gt;
* Decentralization at the level of a neighbourhood – this category includes clusters of homes, gated communities, small districts and areas, which are served by vacuum sewers.  
* Decentralization at “on-site” level ([[Onsite sewage facility|on-site sanitation]]) – in these cases the whole system lays within one property and serves one or several buildings.

== Wastewater treatment options ==
[[File:Biogas digester at Meru prison (3504698658).jpg|thumb|Biogas digester for decentralized wastewater treatment at Meru Prison, Kenya]]
Treatment/disposal facilities requiring effluent infiltration: usually they are applied at on-site level and are adequate because of the very low wastewater quantity generated. However, they require suitable soil conditions, permitting [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] of the excess water, and low [[Water table|ground water table]]. If not applied properly, they may be a serious source of ground water pollution.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;''[https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-06/documents/2004_07_07_septics_septic_2002_osdm_all.pdf Onsite wastewater treatment systems manual]'' (2002), EPA 625/R-00/008, Washington DC, USA&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pit latrine]]s are applied when the water supply is very scarce and wastewater flow can hardly be generated. They are the most common sanitation technique in under-developed areas.
* [[Septic tank]]s are the most common on-site treatment technology used, which can be applied successfully where an adequate water supply is available and the soil/groundwater conditions are acceptable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leverenz" /&gt;
Treatment facilities resembling natural purification processes: their application requires significant surface area, because of the slow pace of the biological processes applied. For the same reason they are more suitable for warmer climates, because the rate of the purification process is temperature dependent. These technologies are more resilient to fluctuating loads and do not require complex maintenance and operation.&lt;ref&gt;Scholzel &amp; Bowel (1999) [http://www.pacificwater.org/userfiles/file/TR0288.pdf Small scale treatment plant project – report on project criteria, guidelines and technologies], SOPAC TR288, retrieved on the 18 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constructed wetland]]s are more suitable for applications at on-site or at neighbourhood level, while [[stabilization pond]]s could be a viable alternative for decentralized systems at the level of small towns or rural communities.

Engineered wastewater treatment technologies: there is a large variety of [[wastewater treatment plants]] where different treatment processes and technologies are applied.&lt;ref&gt;''Wastewater engineering&amp;nbsp;: treatment and reuse (4th ed.). Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc., McGraw Hill, USA. 2003. &amp;nbsp;{{ISBN|0-07-112250-8}}.''&lt;/ref&gt; Small-scale treatment facilities in decentralized systems, apply similar technologies as medium or large plants.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Crites R., Tchobanoglous G. (1998) Small and decentralized &amp;nbsp;wastewater management, ''WCB/McGraw-Hill'', {{ISBN|0-07-289087-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For on-site applications package plants are developed, which are compact and have different compartments for the different processes. However, the design and operation of small treatment plants, especially at neighbourhood or on-site level,  present significant challenges to wastewater engineers, related to flow fluctuations, necessity of competent and specialized operation and maintenance, required to deal with a large number of small plants, and relatively high per capita cost.&lt;ref&gt;Boller. M. (1997) Small wastewater plants- a challenge to wastewater engineers, ''Water Science and Technology,'' Vol 35, issue 6, p.1-12&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulations and management ==
[[Regulation and monitoring of pollution#Water pollution|Water pollution regulations]] in the form of [[legislation]] documents, [[guideline]]s or [[Local ordinance|ordinance]]s prescribe the necessary level of treatment, so that the treated effluent meets the requirements for safe disposal or reuse. Effluent may be disposed by discharging into a natural water body or infiltrated in the ground. In addition, regulations  mention requirements regarding the design and operation of wastewater systems, as well as the penalties and other measures for their enforcement. Centralized systems are designed, built and operated in order to fulfil the existing regulations. Their management usually is executed by [[Local Authorities|local authorities]]. In hybrid systems and small centralized systems in towns or rural communities management can be executed in the same way.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In the case of decentralization at on-site level and clusters of buildings, the whole wastewater system is located within private premises. The costs and responsibility for the design, construction, operation and maintenance is the responsibility of the owner. In many cases specialized companies might execute the operation and maintenance procedures. The local authorities issue permits and may provide support for the operation and management in the form of collecting wastes, issuing certificates/licenses for standardized treatment equipment, or for selected qualified private companies. From regulatory point of view, the control of the quality of treated effluent for reuse, discharge or disposal is entirely the responsibility of local or national government authorities. This might be a challenge if a large number of systems must be controlled and inspected. It is in the owner's interest to operate and maintain the system properly, especially in the case of reuse of the treated effluent. Most often the operational problems are associated with clogging of the treatment facilities as result of irregular removal of the sludge or hydraulic overloading due to increased number of population served or increased water consumption.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Urban planning and infrastructure issues ==
Wastewater systems are part of the [[infrastructure]] of urban or rural communities and the [[urban planning]] process. Urban planning data and information, such as plots of individual dwellings, roads/streets, storm water drainage, water supply, and electricity systems are essential for the design and implementation of a sustainable wastewater system. In decentralized wastewater systems, which collect and treat wastewater only, storm water might be overlooked and cause flooding problems. If planned decentralized solutions are applied, storm water drainage should be executed together with the roads system.

In under-developed population centres where no infrastructure is available, is difficult to provide sustainable sanitation measures; e.g. pit latrines/septic tanks need periodic cleansing, usually executed by [[Vacuum Tracks|vacuum tracks]], which have to access the latrine and need a basic road for this purpose. [[Fecal sludge management]] deals with the organization and implementation of this practice in a sustainable way, including collection, transport, treatment and disposal/reuse of faecal sludge from pit latrines and septic tanks.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;WSTF (2015). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2448 Design and Technologies of Decentralised Treatment Facilities] - Manuals and further documents developed in the context of GIZ’s Water Sector Reform Programme. Water Services Trust Fund (WSTF), Nairobi, Kenya&lt;/ref&gt;

In the cases of new urban/rural developments, or the retrofitting of  existing ones, it is advisable  to consider different alternatives regarding the design of the wastewater system, including decentralized solutions. A sustainable approach would require optimal technical solutions in terms of reliability and cost effectiveness.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; From this perspective, centralized solutions might be more appropriate in many cases, depending on existing sizes of plots, [[topography]], [[geology]], ground water tables  and climatic conditions. But when applied adequately, decentralized systems allow for the application of more environmentally friendly solutions and reuse of the treated effluent, including recovery and reuse of specific elements. In this way alternative water resources are provided and the environment is protected. In addition [[Public awareness of science|public awareness]], perceptions and support are an important  part of the urban planning process in general, and the choice of adequate wastewater system in specific.,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Anderson K., Dickin S., Rosemarin A. (2017) [http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/8/12/1289/htm Towards "sustainable" sanitation: challenges and opportunities in urban areas",] ''Sustainability,'' 8, doi: 10-3390/su8121289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2757 Wastewater - the untapped resource], The UN world water development report 2017, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
One example of decentralized treatment is the "DEWATS technology" which has been promoted under this name by the German NGO [[Bremen Overseas Research and Development Association|BORDA]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It has been applied in many countries in South East Asia and in South Africa.&lt;ref name="ESCAP"&gt;ESCAP, UN-Habitat, AIT (2015).

Water Research Commission (WRC), Gezina ZA, South Africa&lt;/ref&gt; It applies [[anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] treatment processes, including anaerobic baffled reactors (ABRs) and [[anaerobic filter]]s, followed by aerobic treatment in ponds or in constructed wetlands. This technology was researched and tested in South Africa where it was shown that the treatment efficiency was lower than expected.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Reynaud, N. (2015). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2415 Operation of Decentralised Wastewater Treatment Systems (DEWATS) under tropical field conditions.] PhD thesis, Faculty of Environmental Sciences, Technical University, Dresden&lt;/ref&gt;

A case study of a decentralized wastewater system at on-site level with treated effluent reuse was performed at the Botswana Technology Centre in Gaborone, Botswana.&lt;ref&gt;Hranova R (2005) The Wastewater Reuse Practice in Botswana – a Challenge for the Development of the Water Sector, ''Proceedings of the BIE annual conference – 19–21 October 2005, Gaborone, Botswana.'' (Proceedings in CD format)&lt;/ref&gt; It is an example of a decentralized wastewater system, which serves one institutional building, located in an area served by municipal sewerage. Wastewater from the building is treated in a plant consisting of: septic tank, followed by planted rock filter, [[Biofilter|bio-filter]] and a surface flow wetland. The treated effluent is reused for irrigation of the surrounding green areas, but the study registered outflow from the wetland only during periods of heavy rains. This example shows the need for careful estimation of the expected quantity, quality and fluctuations of the generated wastewater when designing decentralized wastewater systems.

'''''Divine Action and Modern Science''''' (2002) is a book written by Nicholas Saunders. It looks at [[Near East]]ern biblical and modern theological approaches to the idea of [[Divine Providence|divine action]], covering such questions as how divine action occurs, what its effects are, the relationship between divine and finite causation and complementarity versus [[mutually exclusive|mutual exclusivity]]. Saunders concludes that God is active in the physical world, but not as described by traditional accounts.&lt;ref&gt;David Atkinson, Words and works, ''[[Times Literary Supplement]],'' January 9, 2004 issue 5258 p27(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this book, Saunders differentiates between general and special divine action, with the former referring to the actions of God concerning the entirety of the natural order (initial creation and continual sustenance), and the latter pointing to the actions of God with regards to a particular time and place (such as a particular divine intervention or responses to prayer).

The author’s categorical disagreement with current endeavors to bring together special divine action (SDA) with quantum assumptions and chaos theory is reflected in the book, saying that people are still remotely far from a reasonable hypothesis of divine action in a world that is consonant with contemporary science. Nonetheless, Saunders presumes that God exists and is currently active in the world in a specific sense setting off new fundamental interactions in nature. The book’s writer further concedes that while people cannot ever seek to have inclusive comprehension of God’s action within the world, this should not be a reason for anyone to go to the opposite extreme and assert that God’s transcendence prohibits any evocative discussions of His actions.

== Key points ==
Essentially, ''Divine Action and Modern Science'' attempted to reconcile God and his actions with science. The book's main thesis is that Divine action should be considered an action upon and within nature. This being said, it is part of nature and, therefore, "the mechanics of describing such action, in some way, correlate with the mechanics of describing nature herself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epperson|first=Michael|date=October 2004|title=Book Review: Nicholas. Saunders,&amp;nbsp; Divine Action and Modern Science.|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/426996?journalCode=jr|journal=The Journal of Religion|language=en|volume=84|issue=4|pages=648–649|doi=10.1086/426996|issn=0022-4189|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saunders also drew from several theories on Divine Action such as those put forward by thinkers William Pollard, [[Nancey Murphy]], and [[Thomas M. Tracy|Thomas Tracy]], among others. In his discourse, the author – through the evidence provided by these scholars – concluded that for each Divine action, there is a scientific feasibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wesleywildman.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/docs/2003-Wildman-Review-of-Saunders-Divine-Action-and-Modern-Science.pdf|title=Divine Action and Modern Science|last=Wildman|first=Wesley|date=2002|website=Wesley Wildman|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the book claimed that a scientific explanation of the Divine action could revolutionize theological traditions, making it more relevant and tenable in light of our modern understanding of the natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Divine Action and Modern Science|last=Saunders|first=Nicholas|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521801567|location=Cambridge|pages=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File: Woman-power emblem.svg|thumb|upright|A generic symbol for feminism]]
'''Feminist political theory''' is a diverse subfield of [[feminist theory]] working towards three main goals:
# To understand and critique the role of gender in how [[political theory]] is conventionally construed.
# To re-frame and re-articulate conventional [[political theory]] in light of feminist issues (especially gender equality).
# To support [[political science]] presuming and pursuing gender equality.
Feminist political theory encompasses a broad scope of approaches. It overlaps with related areas including feminist jurisprudence/[[feminist legal theory]]; feminist political philosophy; female-centered empirical research in political science; and feminist research methods ([[feminist method]]) for use in political science the social sciences. Indeed, one scholar notes that, insofar as almost all versions of feminism involve "demonstrating the ways in which politics, understood as power relations, is present in our everyday lives," one could reasonably "describe feminist theory as a whole as a kind of political philosophy."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Feminist Political Theory|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781444367072.wbiee757/abstract|publisher = Blackwell Publishing Ltd|date = 2013-01-01|isbn = 9781444367072|doi = 10.1002/9781444367072.wbiee757/full|first = Lori|last = Watson}}&lt;/ref&gt; What frequently distinguishes feminist political theory from feminism broadly is the specific examination of the state and its role in the reproduction or redressing of gender inequality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to being broad and multidisciplinary, the field is relatively new, inherently innovative, and still expanding; the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' explains that "feminist political philosophy serves as a field for developing new ideals, practices, and justifications for how political institutions and practices should be organized and reconstructed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Summer 2014|title = Feminist Political Philosophy|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2014/entries/feminism-political/|date = 2014-01-01|first = Noëlle|last = McAfee|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
For summary of feminist history more broadly, see [[feminism]]. Feminist political theory as a term only consolidated in the West during Women's Liberation movements of the 1960s and 70s. Previously, very few works of political theory explicitly considered women's political situation. John Stuart Mill’s 1861 call for women's suffrage in ''The Subjection of Women'' is a notable exception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = John Stuart Mill: The Subjection of Women|url = http://www.constitution.org/jsm/women.htm|website = www.constitution.org|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th Century, Simone de Beauvoir’s 1949 work ''The Second Sex'' exposed the power dynamics surrounding womanhood and laid the foundation for subsequent feminist theories exposing women's social subjugation. In the 1980s and 1990s, feminist theory expanded into the legal realm led by Catharine MacKinnon’s and Andrea Dworkin’s campaigns against pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = philosophical feminism|url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/philosophical-feminism|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several distinct stages are sketched out below.

=== Liberal feminism ===
[[Liberal feminism]] marks an important approach to feminist politics which was especially pervasive during the first half of the twentieth century. Some of the most well known examples of liberal feminist writing were published far earlier,  including [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) and [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' (1869). A common theme of liberal feminism is an emphasis on equal opportunity via fair opportunity and equal political rights. In addition, according to ''The International Encyclopedia of Ethics,'' "[L]iberal feminisms of both the past and the present retain some commitment to the distinction between the public and private realms – a distinction [which is the] focus of much critique within feminist political theory."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Marxist, socialist and radical feminism ===
Marxist feminism and socialist feminism considered classism as the primary source of women's oppression&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Unhappy Marriage of Marxism and Feminism: Towards a More Progressive Union|last=Hartmann|first=Heidi|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=0-415-93152-5|location=Feminist Theory Reader (Eds: McCann &amp; Kim)|pages=206-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pandora's Box: Subjectivity, class, and sexuality in socialist feminist criticism|last=Kaplan|first=Cora|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=1985|isbn=0-8135-2388-5|location=Feminisms (1997) (Eds: Warhol &amp; Herndl)|pages=956-975}}&lt;/ref&gt;. "...

== Topics of inquiry ==
=== Feminist epistemology ===
A key aspect of feminist political theory/philosophy is feminist epistemology. Feminist epistemologists question the objectivity of social and philosophical sciences by contending that standards of authority and credibility are socially constructed and thus reflect and re-entrench the sociopolitical status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = philosophical feminism|url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/philosophical-feminism|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, one common feminist methodological solution is to include many diverse voices reflecting all parts of society in the process of knowledge-making.

=== Gendered political institutions ===
Political theory on the gendering of institutions explores questions such what does it mean for an institution to be “gendered," how can one evaluate whether an institution is gendered, and what are the consequences of gendered institutions for the people who work within them (of all genders). An example of such related scholarship is Eileen McDonagh's book ''The Motherless State'' which explores how socially feminized "motherly" attributes have been stripped from modern governance models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Motherless State|last = McDonagh|first = Eileen|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Chicago|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Group identity/identity politics ===
Theorist studying this aspect of feminist political theory question the construction of women as an identity group. On a basic level, they consider whether it is even possible to come to some sort of conclusion about a "women" group’s relation to politics. One facet of the debate involves [[intersectionality]] and whether women from different racial and cultural backgrounds have enough in common to form a political group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Should Blacks Represent Blacks and Women Represent Women? A Contingent Yes|last = Mansbridge|first = Jane|date = 1999|journal = Journal of Politics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another facet questions whether transgender women should be included in the group "women" insofar as they lack many of the experiences of girlhood and womanhood which bind "women" together as a distinct group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Dispute Between Radical Feminism and Transgenderism|url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/04/woman-2|website = The New Yorker|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another approach to this topic includes redefining "groupness;" for example, Iris Marion Young has suggested women are more of a "seriality" rather than a group insofar as they undergo similar experiences but in isolation of each other, lacking a sense of group identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Gender as Seriality: Thinking About Women as a Social Collective|last = Young|first = Iris Marion|date = 1994|journal = Signs|doi =10.1086/494918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political leadership and gender ===
This field address how women lead differently than their male counterparts as legislators, executives, and judges. Some scholars in this field study how political leadership is itself masculinized to exclude the kinds of political leadership women most frequently provide, often outside of formal offices. For example, Hardy-Fanta looks at grassroots political work in Latino communities in the U.S. to identify feminized political leadership roles, ultimately concluding that Latina women provide the most critical leadership and work in those communities—despite the fact that most studies overlook their leadership because it does  not occur within formal officeholding roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Latina Women and Political Leadership|last = Hardy-Fanta|first = Carol|date = 1995|journal = New England Journal of Public Policy|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Friedrich Miescher]] Laboratory''' (FML) of the [[Max Planck Society]] is a biological research institute located on the Society's campus in [[Tübingen]], Germany. It was founded in 1969 to offer highly qualified junior scientists in the area of biology an opportunity to establish independent research groups and pursue their own line of research within a five-year period (extensions possible). The group leaders are elected by a committee of scientists from diverse areas and institutions on the basis of a public tendering procedure. While at the FML, they can use modern, well-equipped laboratories and work in teams tailored to their ideas. The laboratory is not headed by a director. Instead, the group leaders take turns in representing the FML, and its administrative and organizational interests. Furthermore, all group leaders jointly manage the funds available to the laboratory.

There is no specification as to which kind of biological research should be conducted at the FML, and the focus of research changes with the appointment of each new group leader. In the past, research interests have included developmental biology, neurobiology, cell biology, psychology and many other areas of modern biology.

'''Geriatric sexology''' is the systematic study of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] in the elderly. It encompasses all aspects of sexuality, including attempting to characterise "normal sexuality" and its variants, including [[paraphilia]]s and disorders of or relating to [[sex]] and the [[sex organ]]s. The field covers [[physiological]] and [[psychological]] aspects of sexuality and its disorders.

{{RunicChars}}
The '''Golden Horns of Gallehus''' were two horns made of [[Sheet metal|sheet]] [[gold]],  discovered in Gallehus, north of [[Møgeltønder]] in [[Southern Jutland]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name=drfactbox&gt;[http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Indland/2007/12/20/114905.htm?rss=true Official Danish news (DR) page with fact box regarding the subject] {{da icon}}; The horns are also identified as ''Tunderense''  in older literature,   a learned Latin adjective formation of  ''Tundern'', the old name of Tønder.&lt;/ref&gt;
The horns dated to the early 5th century, i.e. the beginning of the [[Germanic Iron Age]].

The horns were found in 1639 and in 1734, respectively, at locations only some 15–20 metres apart.&lt;ref name=drfactbox/&gt; They were composed of segments of double sheet gold. The two horns were found incomplete; the longer one found in 1639 had seven segments with ornaments, to which six plain segments and a plain rim were added, possibly by the 17th-century restorer. The shorter horn found in 1734 had six segments, a narrow one bearing a [[Proto-Norse]] [[Elder Futhark]] inscription at the rim and five ornamented with images. It is uncertain whether the horns were intended as [[drinking horn]]s, or as [[blowing horn]]s, although drinking horns have more pronounced history as luxury items made from precious metal.

The original horns were stolen and melted down in 1802. Casts made of the horns in the late 18th century were also lost. Replicas of the horns must thus rely on 17th and 18th-century drawings exclusively and are accordingly fraught with uncertainty. Nevertheless,  replicas of the original horns were produced and are exhibited at the [[National Museum of Denmark]], [[Copenhagen]], and the [[Moesgaard Museum]], near [[Aarhus]], Denmark. These replicas also have a history of having been stolen and retrieved twice, in 1993 and in 2007.

The horns are the subject of one of the best-known poems in Danish literature, "The Golden Horns" (''Guldhornene''), by [[Adam Oehlenschläger]].

==Description==
Both horns consisted of two layers of gold sheet, the inner sheet of lesser quality, amalgamated with silver, the outer sheet of pure gold. The outer sheet was constructed from a number of rings, each covered with cast figures soldered onto the rings, with yet more figures chased into the rings between the larger figures. The second horn bore an [[Elder Futhark]] inscription in [[Proto-Norse]] which is of great value for [[Germanic linguistics]].

Both horns were once the same length,{{Dubious|date=May 2009}} but a segment of the narrow end of the second (shorter) horn, which was missing when it was found (1734), had already been plowed up and recovered prior to 1639. It also was subsequently melted down and lost.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
The longer horn in its restored state was 75.8&amp;nbsp;cm in length, as measured along the outer perimeter; the opening diameter was 10.4&amp;nbsp;cm., and the horn weighed 3.2&amp;nbsp;kg.

Because the casts made of the horns were lost, it is uncertain whether the horns were simply curved or whether they had a winding, helix-like curvature like a natural ox-horn.

[[Image:Inscription on Golden horn of Gallehus.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Detail of the runic inscriptions found on one of the copies housed at the [[Moesgaard Museum]].]]

===Runic inscription===
The second horn bore the following [[Elder Futhark]] inscription ([[Rundata|DR 12 †U]]):
:[[File:Gallehus inscription.png|300px]] (1734 drawing after the original)
:{{Runic|ᛖᚲᚺᛚᛖᚹᚨᚷᚨᛊᛏᛁᛉ᛬ᚺᛟᛚᛏᛁᛃᚨᛉ᛬ᚺᛟᚱᚾᚨ᛬ᛏᚨᚹᛁᛞᛟ᛬}} (Runic [[Unicode]])
:'''ekhlewagastiz:holtijaz:horna:tawido:''' (transliteration)

This is read as a sentence in [[Proto-Norse]], ''{{lang|gem-Latn|ek Hlewagastiz Holtijaz horna tawidō}}'', translating to "I Hlewagastiz Holtijaz made the horn". This inscription is among the earliest inscriptions in the Elder Futhark that record a full sentence, and the earliest preserving a line of [[alliterative verse]].

The meaning of the [[Germanic name|given name]] ''Hlewagastiz'' is debated: it  may mean either "lee guest" or "fame guest". ''Holtijaz'' may either be a patronymic, "son (or descendant) of Holt", or express a characteristic such as "of the wood".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.runenprojekt.uni-kiel.de/abfragen/standard/deutung2.asp?findno=28&amp;ort=Gallehus&amp;objekt=Goldhorn Kiel University] has a compilation of literature. Interpretation as a patronymic is more common. The alternative interpretation   "of the sacred grove" is found in Klingenberg, Heinz ,''Runenschrift - Schriftdenken - Runeninschriften''. Heidelberg (1973) and in Grønvik, Ottar,  'Runeinnskriften på gullhornet fra Gallehus' in ''Maal og Minne'' (1999), 1-18. The translation "wood-dweller" is found in Karker, Allan, ''Dansk i tusind år: Et omrids af sprogets historie'', Copenhagen (1993). An interpretation of ''Holt'' as a toponym, translating "from Holt", is found in Gutenbrunner, Siegfried, ''Schleswig-Holsteins älteste Literatur. Von der Kimbernzeit bis zur Gudrundichtung'', Kiel (1949).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible cipher runes===
[[File:Gallehus cipher Hartner.png|thumb|240px|reading of the supposed cipher in the top segment according to Hartner (1969).]]
The two rows of images in the top segment of the longer horn have been taken as a [[Cipher runes|cipher]] encoding a runic text of 22 letters, although there is no universally accepted decipherment.  Hartner (1969)  read  ''luba horns ens helpa hjoho'', an "[[apotropaic]] sentence" translated by Hartner as "may I, the potion of this horn, bring help to the clan".&lt;ref&gt;review of Hartner (1969) by A. T. Reiche in Isis, The History of Science Society (1973), p. 236; c.f. Beer (1970), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iconography===
{{further|Migration period art}}
{{double image|left|Large Gallehus horn images.png|190|Small Gallehus horn images.png|170|The image panels of the both horns projected onto a flat surface (etchings by J. R. Paulli, 1734)}}
The figures embossed on the horns combine depictions of numerous anthropomorphic, zoomorphic and [[mythological hybrid|hybrid]] motifs. In addition to the main figures which are soldered to the horn, protruding from the horn surface, there are a number of additional figures and ornaments realized by [[chasing]].

There are numerous attempts at their interpretation, all of them speculative. Interpretation is especially difficult since it has to rely on the imprecise drawings made before the loss of the original horns. Interpretations usually try to align the iconography with [[Germanic mythology]], although Mediterranean ([[Byzantine]]) elements are also cited.

Obvious parallels with Germanic [[Migration Period art]] are rather limited. There are large considerable number of serpents, some of them intertwining in the fashion of the wider [[animal style]] of Dark Age Europe. A figure holding a horn may be compared to the "valkyrie" shown on the [[Tjängvide image stone]]. Two masked figures armed with sword and shield on the smaller horn are reminiscent of other Germanic depictions of [[sword-dance]]s, e.g. on the [[Sutton Hoo helmet]]. Two other armed figures with large horns or antlers may be compared to [[horned helmet]] iconography, or to the "[[Cernunnos]]" figure on the [[Gundestrup cauldron]]. The peculiar image of a tricephalous figure has been taken as a pagan predecessor of depictions of a [[tricephalous Christ]] symbolizing the [[Trinity]] in Christian iconography but is difficult to place in a contemporary context. Olrik (1918) nevertheless recognized a number of [[Norse gods]] among the figures, including [[Tyr]], [[Odin]], [[Thor]] and [[Freyr]].&lt;ref&gt;Axel Olrik, ''Gudefremstillinger paa guldhornene og andre ældre mindesmærker'', Danske Studier (1918), 1-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frankfurt historian of science [[Willy Hartner]] in 1969 published an interpretation involving [[gematria]] and [[archaeoastronomy]], taking many of the figures as representing [[constellation]]s, claiming that the iconography refers to a lunar eclipse of 4 November 412 and a solar eclipse of 16 April 413.

The first horn (A) had figures arranged in seven segments, The second horn (B) had six segments including the narrow one containing the runic inscription around the rim.

It is made from a double gold sheet, the outer one of very fine, the inner of inferior gold. It holds one Maß or ... and weighs 7 pounds 14 ounces]]

===First horn===
The longer horn was discovered on July 20, 1639 by a peasant girl named Kirsten Svendsdatter in the village of Gallehus, near [[Møgeltønder]], Denmark when she saw it protrude above the ground. She wrote a letter to King [[Christian IV of Denmark]] who retrieved it and in turn gave it to the Danish [[Christian V of Denmark|prince Christian]], who{{Dubious|date=May 2009}}&lt;!--Christian V was born only in 1646--&gt; refurbished it into a drinking-horn, adding a golden pommel to be screwed on at the narrow end to close it up.

The Danish antiquarian [[Olaus Wormius]] wrote a treatise named ''De aureo cornu'' on the first Golden Horn in 1641.
The first preserved sketch of the horn comes from this treatise. Wormius notes that he had not seen the horn in the state in which it was found, and it cannot now be determined whether the rim and the narrow segments devoid of ornamentation were modern additions like the pommel.

In 1678, the horn was described in the ''[[Journal des Savants]]''.

===Second horn===
About 100 years later on April 21, 1734 the other (shorter, damaged) horn was found by Erich Lassen not far from the first horn. He gave it to the count of Schackenborg who in turn delivered it to King [[Christian VI of Denmark]] and received 200 [[Danish rigsdaler|rigsdaler]] in return. From this moment both horns were stored at ''Det kongelige Kunstkammer'' (The Royal Chamber of Art) at [[Christiansborg]], currently the Danish [[Rigsarkivet]] (national archive). The shorter horn was described in a treatise by archivist Richard Joachim Paulli in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Published in German as ''Zuverlässiger Abriss des Anno 1734 bey Tundern gefundenen Güldenen Horns'' (1734), in Danish translation as ''Tilforladelig Tegning paa det Anno 1734 udi Jydland fundene Guld-Horn'' (1735), with 7 woodcuts, comprising half-page cut on title page and 6 figures depicting the runic inscription and decorations on the golden horn. For reproductions, cf. Oxenstierna, E. C. G. ''Die Goldhörner von Gallehus'', Lidingö, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burglary and destruction==

===Original horns===
On May 4, 1802, the horns were stolen by a [[goldsmith]] and [[watchmaker]] named Niels Heidenreich from [[Foulum]], who entered a storage area containing the horns using forged keys. Heidenreich took the horns home and melted them down to recycle the gold. The theft was discovered the next day&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/golden-horns-of-gallehus/|title=Golden Horns of Gallehus «  Trafficking Culture|website=traffickingculture.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a bounty of 1,000 rigsdaler was advertised in the papers.

The [[master craftsman|grandmaster]] of the goldsmiths [[guild]], Andreas Holm, suspected that Heidenreich had been involved, since he had tried to sell Holm forged “[[pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]s” (Indian coins with god motifs), made from bad gold mixed with [[brass]]. Holm and his colleagues had kept watch on Heidenreich and saw him dump coin stamps in the town moat. He was arrested on April 27, 1803, and confessed on April 30. On June 10, Heidenreich was sentenced to prison, and not released until 1840. He died four years later. His buyers returned the recycled gold, which ended up in coins, not copies of the horns.

However, a set of [[plaster]] casts of the horns had been made for a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in [[Rome]], but they had already been lost in a shipwreck off the [[Corsica]]n coast. Approximate copies were instead created from sketches. The horns pictured above are newer copies, made in 1980.

===Copies===
In 1993, copies of the horns were stolen from [[Moesgaard Museum]], which were shortly after recovered ditched in a forest near [[Hasselager]]. These copies are made of gilded [[brass]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jp.dk/indland/krimi/article1092023.ece Moesgaard udstiller guldhorn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929125611/http://jp.dk/indland/krimi/article1092023.ece |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, 2007, a set of modern [[Gilding|gilded]] [[silver]] copies were stolen from Kongernes Jelling museum at 4:30 in the morning,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jp.dk/indland/krimi/article1091371.ece Professionelle bag tyveri af guldhorn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000510/http://jp.dk/indland/krimi/article1091371.ece |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but were recovered shortly after on September 19, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Trafficking Culture, http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/golden-horns-of-gallehus/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green Monday''' (GM) is a startup that makes low-carbon and sustainable living simple. Founded in 2012 in Hong Kong, GM is aimed at tackling [[climate change]] and ensuring [[food security]]. It is selected by FAST COMPANY magazine to be among China's Top 50 Most Innovative Companies of Year 2014.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In 2015, Green Monday launched “Green Common” in Hong Kong to empower the community with food choices that are sustainable, innovative, wholesome and responsible.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Green Monday cites references from the [[United Nations]] that livestock industry and factory farming are the number one contributor of the world's [[carbon footprint]].  Meat production also consumes a disproportionate amount of water and land resources, which directly jeopardizes [[food security]] and [[environmental sustainability]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

As of 2014, results of a survey by market research company Ipsos showed that 1.6 million Hong Kong people, or 23% of the city's total population, embrace "Green Monday" - an increase of 18% from 2012,&lt;ref name="China"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hkedition/2014-11/25/content_18970851.htm|title='Green Monday' backed by 1.6m fans|publisher=Chinadaily.com.cn|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 1,000 restaurants in Hong Kong are offering their menus.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==History==
Green Monday started to grow beyond Hong Kong in 2014. Events that marked their international recognition and growth include:  
* The [[University of Columbia]] became the first university in the US to launch Green Monday on their campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HQew3aExHc|title=Green Monday at Columbia University!|work=YouTube|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fast Company (magazine)]] named Green Monday among China's Top 50 Most Innovative Companies of Year 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.cn/go.php?m=content&amp;c=index&amp;a=show&amp;catid=17&amp;id=2072|title=快公司中文网|publisher=Fastcompany.cn|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The US Consulate of Hong Kong, the [[American Humane Society]] and the Italian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong became Green Monday's partners.&lt;ref name="China"/&gt;
* Green Monday was launched at the [[Washington University in St. Louis]] in January 2015, becoming the second university in the US to join the program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainability.wustl.edu/campus-operations/sustainable-dining/green-monday/|title=Sustainable Dining, Green Monday|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Green Monday's School Program has been sponsored by a local bank Charitable Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bochk.com/ir/pdf/bochold/2013annual_report/ch14_e.pdf|format=PDF|title=Local Bank Annual Report 2013|publisher=Bochk.com|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, More than 800 schools with about 600,000 students from kindergarten to university in Hong Kong pledged to observe "Green Monday".&lt;ref name="China"/&gt; From November 2012 to June 2013, the average vegetarian meal order rate increased from 4% to 42%.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
* Major universities in Hong Kong, including the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], [[Hong Kong Baptist University]] and the [[Hong Kong University]] have also joined the Green Monday School Program.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
* Outside Hong Kong,  [[Columbia University]], [[Washington University in St. Louis]], [[UCLA]] and [[Tsinghua University]] have launched Green Monday on their campuses.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Criticism==
Although Green Monday is often compared with another movement [[Meatless Monday]], Green Monday insists that they simply want to create more plant-based options in the market and advise against removing conventional meat options.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[Image:Basho by Kinkoku c1820.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Portrait of [[Matsuo Bashō]] by [[Yokoi Kinkoku]], c. 1820. The calligraphy relates one of Bashō's most famous haiku poems: ''Furu ike ya / kawazu tobikomu / mizu no oto'' (An old pond / a frog jumps in / the sound of water).]]

'''{{nihongo|''Haiga''|俳画||extra=haikai drawing}}''' is a style of [[Japanese painting]] that incorporates the [[aesthetics]] of ''[[haikai]]''. ''Haiga'' are typically painted by [[haiku]] poets (''haijin''), and often accompanied by a haiku poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Daijirin'' entry for ''haiga''|url=http://kotobank.jp/word/%E4%BF%B3%E7%94%BB|work=Kotobank dictionary aggregator website|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the poetic form it accompanied, ''haiga'' was based on simple, yet often profound, observations of the everyday world. [[Stephen Addiss]] points out that "since they are both created with the same brush and ink, adding an image to a haiku poem was&amp;nbsp;... a natural activity."&lt;ref&gt;Addiss. p14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stylistically, ''haiga'' vary widely based on the preferences and training of the individual painter, but generally show influences of formal [[Kanō school]] painting, minimalist [[Zen painting]], and [[Ōtsu-e]], while sharing much of the aesthetic attitudes of the ''[[nanga (art)|nanga]]'' tradition. Some were reproduced as [[woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock prints]]. The subjects painted likewise vary widely, but are generally elements mentioned in the [[calligraphy]], or poetic images which add meaning or depth to that expressed by the poem. The moon is a common subject in these poems and paintings, sometimes represented by the Zen circle ''[[ensō]]'', which evokes a number of other meanings, including that of the [[Mu (negative)|void]]. Other subjects, ranging from [[Mount Fuji]] to rooftops, are frequently represented with a minimum of brushstrokes, thus evoking elegance and beauty in simplicity.

==History==
[[Image:A little cuckoo across a hydrangea(Haiga) by Yosa Buson.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A little cuckoo across a hydrangea by [[Yosa Buson]].]]

[[Nonoguchi Ryūho]] (1595–1669), a student of [[Kanō Tan'yū]], is sometimes credited{{By whom|date=November 2012}} with founding the style; though poetry was commonly accompanied by images for centuries prior, Ryūho was the first poet to regularly include paintings alongside his calligraphy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

[[Matsuo Bashō]], known worldwide as the definitive master of haiku, frequently painted as well. ''Haiga'' became a major style of painting as a result of association with his famous works of haiku.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Like his poems, Bashō's paintings are founded in a simplicity which reveals great depth, complementing the poems they are paired with. Towards the end of his life, he studied painting under [[Morikawa Kyoriku]], his pupil in poetry; the works of both men benefited from the exchange, and a number of works were produced combining Morikawa's painting with Bashō's poetry and calligraphy.

Composing haiku, and painting accompanying pictures, was a common pastime of [[Edo period]] aesthetes, who would pursue these activities in their spare time, or at friendly gatherings as a communal form of entertainment. The famous novelist [[Ihara Saikaku]] was one of many people not normally associated with either poetry or painting, who took part. By contrast, the ''[[nanga (art)|nanga]]'' painter [[Yosa Buson]], widely considered second only to Bashō as a master of haiku, is said to be "the only artist to be included in surveys both of great poets and great painters in Japanese history."&lt;ref&gt;Addiss. p15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other schools of painting which maintained a standard set of styles passed from master to apprentice, the genre of ''haiga'' encompassed a variety of artists with different approaches. Some, like Bashō, were primarily poets, accompanying their compositions with simple sketches,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} while others, like Buson, were primarily painters, devoting more space and centrality of focus to the image.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Maruyama Goshun]] and [[Ki Baitei]] were among those who tended to paint portraits of poets and other figures in a relatively quick, loose style which looks somewhat [[cartoon]]ish to the modern eye. Some ''haiga'' paintings, such as those by [[Morikawa Kyoriku]], reflect the formal training of the artists, while others, like those by [[Nakahara Nantenbō]], reflect the artist's background in [[Zen]].

One overall trend that developed over time, despite this wide variety, was a shift from the circles of literati (''bunjin'') painters to the orbit of the [[Shijō school]] of the naturalistic painter [[Maruyama Ōkyo]]. This move was effected primarily by Maruyama Goshun,{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} and can be seen as well in the works of [[Yamaguchi Soken]]. Some later painters, such as [[Takebe Sōchō]], were influenced by ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' styles, and used color in highly detailed works.

Though traditional-style ''haiga'' are still produced today, contemporary artists experiment with the style, coupling haiku with digital imagery, photography, and other media.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

'''Homogenization''' in [[Climatology|climate research]] means the removal of non-climatic changes. Next to [[Climate change|changes in the climate]] itself, raw climate records also contain non-climatic jumps  and changes for example due to relocations or changes in instrumentation. The most used principle to remove these inhomogeneities is the relative homogenization approach in which a candidate [[Weather station|stations]] is compared to a reference time series based on one or more neighboring stations. The candidate and reference station(s) experience about the same climate, non-climatic changes that happen only in one station can thus be identified and removed.

==Climate observations==
To study climate change and variability long instrumental climate records are essential, but are best not used directly. These datasets are essential since they are the basis for assessing century-scale trends or for studying the natural (long-term) variability of climate, amongst others. The value of these datasets, however, strongly depends on the homogeneity of the underlying time series. A homogeneous climate record is one where variations are caused only by variations in weather and climate. Long instrumental records are rarely, if ever homogeneous.

Results from the homogenization of instrumental western climate records indicate that detected inhomogeneities in mean temperature series occur at a frequency of roughly 15 to 20 years.&lt;ref name="aueretal2007"&gt;Auer, I., R.

It should be kept in mind that most measurements have not been specifically made for climatic purposes, but rather to meet the needs of weather forecasting, agriculture and hydrology.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, C. N. jr., Menne, M. J., [[Peter Thorne (climatologist)|Thorne, P.W.]] "Benchmarking the performance of pairwise homogenization of surface temperatures in the United States. Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres", 117, D5, {{doi|10.1029/2011JD016761}}, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the typical size of the breaks is often of the same order as the climatic change signal during the 20th century.&lt;ref name="aueretal2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="menne2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brunettietal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="caussinus_mestre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dellamarta" /&gt;
Inhomogeneities are thus a significant source of uncertainty for the estimation of secular trends and decadal-scale variability.

If all inhomogeneities would be purely random perturbations of the climate records, collectively their effect on the mean global climate signal would be negligible. However, certain changes are typical for certain periods and occurred in many stations, these are the most important causes as they can collectively lead to artificial biases in climate trends across large regions.

==Causes of inhomogeneities==
[[Image:HeatIsland Kanto en.png|thumb|300px|[[Tokyo]], an example of an urban heat island. Normal temperatures of Tokyo go up more than those of the surrounding area.]]

The best known inhomogeneity is the [[Urban heat island#Global warming|urban heat island effect]]. The temperature in cities can be warmer than in the surrounding country side, especially at night. Thus as cities grow, one may expect that temperatures measured in cities become higher. On the other hand, with the advent of aviation, many meteorological offices and thus their [[Weather station|stations]] have often been relocated from cities to nearby, typically cooler, airports.&lt;ref name="trewin"&gt;Trewin, B.: "Exposure, instrumentation, and observing practice effects on land temperature measurements".'' WIREs Clim. Change'', 1, 490–506, {{doi|10.1002/wcc.46}}, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Stevenson screen exterior.JPG|thumb|Exterior of a Stevenson screen]]
Other non-climatic changes can be caused by changes in measurement methods. Meteorological instruments are typically installed in a screen to protect them from direct sun and wetting.&lt;ref&gt;Meulen, van der, J.P. and T. Brandsma. "Thermometer screen intercomparison in De Bilt (The Netherlands), part I: Understanding the weather-dependent temperature differences". ''Int. J. Climatol.'', {{doi|10.1002/joc.1531}}, 28, 371-387, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 19th century it was common to use a metal screen in front of a window on a North facing wall. However, the building may warm the screen leading to higher temperature measurements. When this problem was realized the [[Stevenson screen]] was introduced, typically installed in gardens, away from buildings. This is still the most typical weather screen with its characteristic [[Louver|double-louvre]] door and walls for ventilation. The historical Montsouri and Wilds screens were used around 1900 and are open to the North and to the bottom. This improves ventilation, but it was found that infra-red radiation from the ground can influence the measurement on sunny calm days. Therefore, they are no longer used. Nowadays [[automatic weather station]]s, which reduce labor costs, are becoming more common; they protect the thermometer by a number of white plastic cones.&lt;ref name="begert" /&gt; This necessitated changes from manually recorded liquid and glass thermometers to automated electrical resistance thermometers, which reduced the recorded temperature values in the USA.&lt;ref name="menne2009" /&gt;

Also other climate elements suffer from inhomogeneities. The precipitation amounts observed in the early instrumental period, roughly before 1900, are biased and are 10% lower than nowadays because the 
[[Rain gauge|precipitation measurements]] were often made on a roof. At the time, instruments were installed on rooftops to ensure that the instrument is never shielded from the rain, but it was found later that due to the turbulent flow of the wind on roofs, some rain droplets and especially snow flakes did not fall into the opening. Consequently, measurements are nowadays performed closer to the ground.

Other typical causes of inhomogeneities are a change in measurement location; many observations, especially of precipitation are performed by volunteers in their garden or at their work place. Changes in the surrounding can often not be avoided, e.g., changes in the vegetation, the [[Impervious surface|sealing of the land surface]], and warm and sheltering buildings in the vicinity. There are also changes in measurement procedures such as the way the daily mean temperature is computed (by means of the minimum and maximum temperatures, or by averaging over 3 or 4 readings per day, or based on 10-minute data). Also changes in the observation times can lead to inhomogeneities. A recent review by Trewin focused on the causes of inhomogeneities.&lt;ref name="trewin" /&gt;

The inhomogeneities are not always errors. This is seen most clear for stations affected by warming due to the urban heat island effect. From the perspective of global warming, such local effects are undesirable, but to study the influence of climate on health such measurements are fine. Other inhomogeneities are due to compromises that have to be made between ventilation and protection against the sun and wetting in the design of a weather shelter. Trying to reduce one type of error (for a certain weather condition) in the design will often lead to the more errors from the other factors. Meteorological measurements are not made in the laboratory. Small errors are inevitable and may not be relevant for meteorological purposes, but if such an error changes, it may well be an inhomogeneity for climatology.

==Homogenization==
To reliably study the real development of the climate, non-climatic changes have to be removed. The date of the change is often documented (called meta data: data about data), but not always. Meta data is often only available in the local language. In the best case, there are parallel measurements with the original and the new set-up for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Aguilar E., Auer, I., Brunet, M., Peterson, T. C., and Wieringa, J.: [http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/wcdmp/wcdmp_series/documents/WCDMP-53.pdf ''Guidelines on climate metadata and homogenization'']. World Meteorological Organization, WMO-TD No. 1186, WCDMP No. 53, Geneva, Switzerland, 55 p., 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; 
This is a WMO ([[World Meteorological Organisation]]) guideline, but parallel measurements are unfortunately not very often performed, if only because the reason for stopping the original measurement is not known in advance, but probably more often to save money. By making parallel measurement with replicas of historical instruments, screens, etc. some of these inhomogeneities can still be studied today.
[[File:Centre for Climate Change (C3) Terragona, weather screen intercomparison study.JPG|thumb|upright=1.8|One way to study the influence of changes in measurement techniques is by making simultaneous measurements with historical and current instruments, procedures or screens. This picture shows three meteorological shelters next to each other in Murcia (Spain). The rightmost shelter is a replica of the Montsouri screen, in use in Spain and many European countries in the late 19th century and early 20th century. In the middle, Stevenson screen equipped with automatic sensors. Leftmost, Stevenson screen equipped with conventional meteorological instruments.]]

Because you are never sure that your meta data (station history) is complete, statistical homogenization should always be applied as well. The most commonly used statistical principle to detect and remove the effects of artificial changes is relative homogenization, which assumes that nearby stations are exposed to almost the same climate signal and that thus the differences between nearby stations can be utilized to detect inhomogeneities.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad, V. and Pollak, C.: [https://archive.org/details/methodsinclimato032726mbp ''Methods in Climatology'']. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, 459 p., 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; 
By looking at the difference time series, the year-to-year variability of the climate is removed, as well as regional climatic trends. In such a difference time series, a clear and persistent jump of, for example 1&amp;nbsp;°C, can easily be detected and can only be due to changes in the measurement conditions.

If there is a jump (break) in a difference time series, it is not yet clear which of the two stations it belongs to. Furthermore, time series typically have more than just one jump. These two features make statistical homogenization a challenging and beautiful statistical problem. Homogenization algorithms typically differ in how they try to solve these two fundamental problems.&lt;ref name="venemaetal"&gt;Venema, V., O. Mestre, E. Aguilar, I. Auer, J.A. Guijarro, P. Domonkos, G. Vertacnik, T. Szentimrey, P. Stepanek, P. Zahradnicek, J. Viarre, G. Müller-Westermeier, M. Lakatos, C.N. Williams, 
M.J. Menne, R. Lindau, D. Rasol, E. Rustemeier, K. Kolokythas, T. Marinova, L. Andresen, F. Acquaotta, S. Fratianni, S. Cheval, M. Klancar, M. Brunetti, Ch. Gruber, M. Prohom Duran, T. Likso, 
P. Esteban, Th. Brandsma. [http://www.clim-past.net/8/89/2012/ "Benchmarking homogenization algorithms for monthly data"]. ''Climate of the Past'', '''8''', 89-115, {{doi|10.5194/cp-8-89-2012}}, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, it was customary to compute a composite reference time series computed from multiple nearby stations, compare this reference to the candidate series and assume that any jumps found are due to the candidate series.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandersson, A.: "A homogeneity test applied to precipitation data". ''J. Climatol.'', {{doi|10.1002/joc.3370060607}}, 6, 661-675, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter assumption works because by using multiple stations as reference, the influence of inhomogeneities on the reference are much reduced. However, modern algorithms, no longer assume that the reference is homogeneous and can achieve better results this way. There are two main ways to do so. You can compute multiple composite reference time series from subsets of surrounding stations and test these references for homogeneity as well.
&lt;ref&gt;Szentimrey, T.: "Multiple Analysis of Series for Homogenization (MASH)". ''Proceedings of the second seminar for homogenization of surface climatological data'', Budapest, Hungary; WMO, WCDMP-No. 41, 27-46, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
Alternatively, you can only use pairs of stations and by comparing all pairs with each other determine which station most likely is the one with the break.&lt;ref name="caussinus_mestre" /&gt; If there is a break in 1950 in pair A&amp;amp;B and B&amp;amp;C, but not in A&amp;amp;C, the break is likely in station B; with more pairs such an inference can be made with more certainty.

If there are multiple breaks in a time series, the number of combinations easily becomes very large and it is becomes impossible to try them all. For example, in case of five breaks (''k''=5) in 100 years of annual data (''n''=100), the number of combinations is about 100&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;=10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; or 10 billion. This problem is sometimes solved iteratively/hierarchically, by first searching for the largest jump and then repeating the search in both sub-sections until they are too small. This does not always produce good results. A direct way to solve the problem is by an efficient optimization method called [[dynamic programming]].

Sometimes there are no other stations in the same climate region. In this case, sometimes absolute homogenization is applied and the inhomogeneities are detected in the time series of one station. If there is a clear and large break at a certain date, you may well be able to correct it, but smaller jumps and gradually occurring inhomogeneities (urban heat island or a growing vegetation) cannot be distinguished from real natural variability and climate change. Data homogenized this way does not have the quality you may expect and should be used with much care.

==Inhomogeneities in climate data==
By homogenizing climate datasets, it was found that sometimes inhomogeneities can cause biased trends in raw data; that homogenization is indispensable to obtain reliable regional or global trends. For example, for the Greater Alpine Region a bias in the temperature trend between the 1870s and 1980s of half a degree was found, which was due to ''decreasing urbanization'' of the network and systematic changes in the time of observation.&lt;ref&gt;Böhm R., Auer, I., Brunetti, M., Maugeri, M., Nanni, T., and Schöner, W.: "Regional temperature variability in the European Alps 1760–1998 from homogenized instrumental time series". ''International Journal of Climatology'', {{doi|10.1002/joc.689}}, 21, pp. 1779–1801, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
The precipitation records of the early instrumental period are biased by -10% due to the systematic higher installation of the gauges at the time.&lt;ref name="aueretal2005"&gt;Auer I, Böhm, R., Jurkovic, A., Orlik, A., Potzmann, R., Schöner W., et al.: A new instrumental precipitation dataset for the Greater Alpine Region for the period 1800–2002. International Journal of Climatology,  {{doi|10.1002/joc.1135}}, 25, 139–166, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
Other possible bias sources are new types of weather shelters&lt;ref name="brunettietal" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brunet, M., Asin, J., Sigró, J., Banón, M., García, F., Aguilar, E., Esteban Palenzuela, J., Peterson, T. C., and Jones, P.: "The minimization of the screen bias from ancient Western Mediterranean air temperature 
records: an exploratory statistical analysis". ''Int. J. Climatol.'', {{doi|10.1002/joc.2192}}, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the change from liquid and glass thermometers to electrical resistance thermometers,&lt;ref name="menne2009" /&gt; as well as the tendency to replace observers by automatic weather stations,&lt;ref name="begert" /&gt; the urban heat island effect and the transfer of many urban stations to airports.&lt;ref name="trewin" /&gt;

In the project HOME homogenization algorithms were recently tested on artificial climate data with known inhomogeneities and it was found that relative homogenization improves temperature records and that the modern methods that do not work with a homogeneous reference are most accurate.&lt;ref name="venemaetal" /&gt;

'''Integrated landscape management''' is a way of managing a landscape that brings together multiple stakeholders, who collaborate to integrate policy and practice for their different land use objectives, with the purpose of achieving sustainable landscapes.&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reed" /&gt;

Integrated landscape management is one approach to addressing the major global challenges of [[poverty]], [[food security]], [[climate change]], [[water scarcity]], [[deforestation]] and [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] at the local level. Proponents of integrated landscape management argue that as these challenges are interconnected, coordinated approaches are needed to address them, in order for landscapes (heterogenous geographic areas) to generate multiple benefits. For example, one river basin can supply water for towns and agriculture, timber and food crops for smallholders and industry, and habitat for biodiversity; the way in which each one of these sectors pursues its goals can have impacts on the others.&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=A K|last2=McMichael|first2=P|last3=Milder|first3=J C|last4=Scherr|first4=S J|title=Multi-functional landscapes from the grassroots?

Integrated landscape management is increasingly recognised and taken up by intergovernmental bodies,&lt;ref name="SBSTTA report" /&gt; government initiatives,&lt;ref name="GMS BLL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IINDC" /&gt; research institutes,&lt;ref name="CIFOR landscapes pg" /&gt; and some of the world's largest conservation NGOs,&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt; resulting in an increase in the number of examples of the approach in practice. However, barriers to uptake include difficulties in monitoring integrated landscape management and the proliferation of definitions and terms relating to it.&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt;

== Development and uptake of the approach ==
Efforts to develop and implement concepts that integrate social and economic development, and biodiversity conservation are not new.  Integrated landscape management has evolved through multiple iterations and alongside other concepts&lt;ref name="Reed"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=J|last2=Deakin|first2=E|last3=Sunderland|first3=T|title=What are ‘Integrated Landscape Approaches’ and how effectively have they been implemented in the tropics: a systematic map protocol|journal=Environmental Evidence|date=2015|volume=4:2|url=http://www.cifor.org/library/5422/what-are-integrated-landscape-approaches-and-how-effectively-have-they-been-implemented-in-the-tropics-a-systematic-map-protocol/|issn=2047-2382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="learning"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=J|last2=Van Vianen|first2=J|last3=Deakin|first3=E L|last4=Barlow|first4=J|last5=Sunderland|first5=T|title=Integrated landscape approaches to managing social and environmental issues in the tropics: learning from the past to guide the future|journal=Global Change Biology|date=2016|doi=10.1111/gcb.13284|volume=22|pages=2540–2554}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scherr"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scherr|first1=S J|last2=Shames|first2=S|last3=Friedman|first3=R|title=Defining Integrated Landscape Management for Policy Makers|journal=Ecoagriculture Policy Focus|date=2013|issue=10|url=http://ecoagriculture.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/DefiningILMforPolicyMakers.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Minang"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Minang|first1=P A|last2=van Noordwijk|first2=M|last3=Freeman|first3=O E|last4=Mbow|first4=C|last5=de Leeuw|first5=J|last6=Catacutan|first6=D|title=Climate-Smart Landscapes: Multifunctionality In Practice|date=2015|publisher=World Agroforestry Center (ICRAF)|location=Nairobi, Kenya}}&lt;/ref&gt; – from [[watershed management]] to [[landscape ecology]]&lt;ref name="Sayer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sayer|first1=J|title=Reconciling conservation and development: are landscapes the answer?|journal=Biotropica|date=2009|volume=41|issue=6|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00575.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00575.x/abstract|pages=649–652}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from [[landscape-scale conservation]] to indigenous biocultural territorial development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indigenous Biocultural Territories|url=http://www.biocultural.iied.org/indigenous-biocultural-territories|publisher=IIED}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has much in common with the concept of the water-energy-food nexus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water, Food and Energy Nexus|url=http://www.unwater.org/topics/water-food-and-energy-nexus/en/|publisher=UN Water}}&lt;/ref&gt; and draws on the [[ecosystem approach]] (the primary framework for action under the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecosystem Approach Introduction|url=https://www.cbd.int/ecosystem/|publisher=CBD}}&lt;/ref&gt;). There are particular parallels with ‘climate-smart agriculture', which also aims for landscapes to provide multiple benefits in terms of food security, rural livelihoods, and climate change adaptation and mitigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=FAO|title="Climate-Smart" Agriculture: Policies, Practices and Financing for Food Security, Adaptation and Mitigation|date=2010|publisher=FAO|location=Rome, Italy|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i1881e/i1881e00.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interest in landscape approaches has increased in recognition of the connections between the global challenges of [[poverty]], [[food security]], [[climate change]], [[water scarcity]], [[deforestation]] and loss of [[biodiversity]]. For example, lifting people out of poverty can increase consumption and drive climate change;&lt;ref name="Stern"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stern|first1=N|title=The Economics of Climate Change: the Stern Review|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; increasing agricultural production can exacerbate water scarcity and drive habitat loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tilman|first1=D|title=Global environmental impacts of agricultural expansion: the need for sustainable and efficient practices|journal=Proc.

Integrated landscape management has been adopted at the intergovernmental level by the [[UN Environment Programme]], which states that "UNEP champions the landscape approach de facto as it embodies the main elements of integrated ecosystem management"; UNEP puts the approach into practice through a  multinational project of Ecosystem Management of Productive Landscapes.&lt;ref name="UNEPEMPL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecosystems Management of Productive Landscapes|url=https://unepempl.wordpress.com/about/|publisher=UN Environment Programme (UNEP)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] also recognises the approach: its scientific committee has compiled information on improving sustainable use of biodiversity in a landscape perspective, and stated that "As sustainability can only be achieved at an appropriate spatial and temporal context, the landscape level is arguably the most important spatial scale to improve and assess the sustainable management of agricultural and forest ecosystems.".&lt;ref name="SBSTTA report"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Convention on Biological Diversity|first1=SBSTTA|title=Report on how to improve sustainable use of biodiversity in a landscape perspective (UNEP/CBD/SBSTTA/15/13)|url=https://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/sbstta/sbstta-15/official/sbstta-15-13-en.pdf|website=Convention on Biological Diversity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape approaches are also being taken up by national governments (for example, to inform international cooperation for the Greater Mekong Subregion,&lt;ref name="GMS BLL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biodiversity Landscapes and Livelihoods|url=http://www.gms-eoc.org/biodiversity-conservation-corridors-initiative|website=Greater Mekong Subregion - Core Environment Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GMS Workshop on Landscape Approaches|url=http://www.gms-eoc.org/events/gms-workshop-on-landscape-approaches|website=Greater Mekong Subregion - Core Environment Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a foundational principle of Indonesia's climate change commitments&lt;ref name="IINDC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Republic of Indonesia|title=Intended Nationally Determined Contribution|url=http://www4.unfccc.int/submissions/INDC/Published%20Documents/Indonesia/1/INDC_REPUBLIC%20OF%20INDONESIA.pdf|website=UNFCCC submissions}}&lt;/ref&gt;); by international research bodies (for example, the [[Center for International Forestry Research]],&lt;ref name="CIFOR landscapes pg"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR)|url=http://www.cifor.org/sustainable-landscapes/|website=Sustainable Landscapes}}&lt;/ref&gt; which convenes the Global Landscapes Forum&lt;ref name="GLF homepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landscapes.org/|website=Global Landscapes Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;); and conservation NGOs (for example, the [[Worldwide Fund for Nature]], Global Canopy Programme, [[The Nature Conservancy]], IDH - The Sustainable Trade Initiative, and EcoAgriculture Partners, which collaborated on a book on integrated landscape management&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;).

== Definitions ==
A plethora of overlapping ideas and definitions have emerged,&lt;ref name="Reed" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://forestsnews.cifor.org/23834/landscape-approach-defies-simple-definition-and-thats-good?fnl=en|title=‘Landscape approach’ defies simple definition — and that’s good|date=2014-08-27|work=CIFOR Forests News|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; defining landscapes, landscape management, and landscape approaches from the perspectives of different fields (see alternative definitions under [[landscape ecology]], for example). Despite differences in definitions, many terms can be seen as entry points for landscape approaches.&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Minang" /&gt; One set of definitions (developed by a consortium of research groups and NGOs&lt;ref name="LSLB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denier|first1=L|last2=Scherr|first2=S|last3=Shames|first3=S|last4=Chatterton|first4=P|last5=Hovani|first5=L|last6=Stam|first6=N|title=The Little Sustainable Landscapes Book|date=2015|publisher=Global Canopy Programme|location=Oxford|url=http://globalcanopy.org/sustainablelandscapes}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that aims to create a stepwise progression through landscapes, sustainable landscapes, integrated landscape management and landscape approaches is as follows:

"A landscape is a [[socio-ecological system]] that consists of natural and/or human-modified ecosystems, and which is influenced by distinct ecological, historical, economic and socio-cultural processes and activities."&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;

"A sustainable landscape helps to meet the principles of sustainable development as defined in the UN [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. These are landscapes that can meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;

"Integrated landscape management is a way of managing the landscape that involves collaboration among multiple stakeholders, with the purpose of achieving sustainable landscapes."

"The governance structure, size and scope, and number and type of stakeholders involved (private sector, civil society, government) can vary. The level of cooperation also varies, from information sharing and consultation, to more formal models with shared decision-making and joint implementation."&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;

"A landscape approach is a conceptual framework whereby stakeholders in a landscape aim to reconcile competing social, economic and environmental objectives. It seeks to move away from the often-unsustainable sectoral approach to land management. A landscape approach aims to ensure the realisation of local level needs and action (i.e. the interests of different stakeholders within the landscape), while also considering goals and outcomes important to stakeholders outside the landscape, such as national governments or the international community."&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;

== Relevance to international commitments ==
Proponents of integrated landscape management argued that it is well-suited to address complex global challenges, such as those that are the focus of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] and policies for [[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation]] (REDD+).&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SDG briefing" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reed J, van Vianen J, Sunderland T. 2015. From 
global complexity to local reality: Aligning implementation pathways for the Sustainable Development Goals and landscape approaches
. Infobrief No. 129. Bogor, Indonesia: Center for International Forestry Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the '''Sustainable Development Goals''', researchers have drawn parallels between the interdependent nature of these Goals, and the perceived potential for integrated landscape management to maximise collaboration in planning, policy development and action across multiple sectors at the landscape scale.&lt;ref name="SDG briefing" /&gt; Many of the Sustainable Development Goals have potential synergies and trade-offs (conflicts): proponents therefore argue that a sectoral approach may not be effective, whereas landscape approaches provide a potential framework to manage these interlinked challenges. To give more specific examples, increased areas of irrigated agricultural land to meet Goal 2 (ending hunger) could have adverse impacts on Goal 15 (terrestrial ecosystems) or on Goal 6 (sustainable water management).&lt;ref&gt;Reed J, van Vianen J, Sunderland T. 2015. From global complexity to local reality: Aligning implementation pathways for the Sustainable Development Goals and landscape approaches. Infobrief No. 129. Bogor, Indonesia: Center for International Forestry Research.&lt;/ref&gt; Landscape approaches are intended to systematically consider and include diverse stakeholders and sectors, and thus create a mechanism to achieve the multiple objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals – for example, working across the catchment area of a river to enhance agricultural productivity, flood defence, biodiversity and carbon storage, while also strengthened institutions for rural communities.&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;

In terms of '''climate change and REDD+''', unlike other sectors that emit greenhouse gases, the land use sector (including agriculture and forestry) has the potential to mitigate climate change by actively removing greenhouse gases, in addition to simply reducing emissions, especially through reforestation and landscape restoration. This sector accounts for around 24% of anthropogenic emisisons - and a much greater proportion of emissions in many developing countries, where land use represents the largest potential for climate change mitigation.&lt;ref&gt;Smith P., M. Bustamante, H. Ahammad, H. Clark, H. Dong, E. A. Elsiddig, H. Haberl, R. Harper, J. House, M. Jafari, O. Masera, C.  Mbow,  N.  H.  Ravindranath,  C. W.  Rice,  C.  Robledo  Abad,  A.

== Principles and elements ==
Many ways of implementing integrated landscape management have been identified. Two long-term processes by two coalitions of researchers and NGOs developed ten principles for integrated landscape management,&lt;ref name="Ten P" /&gt; and five elements of integrated landscape management.&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;

The '''Ten Principles of Landscape Approach''' include the need for continual learning and [[adaptive management]], which incorporates participatory monitoring; the expectation that actions take place at multiple scales and that landscapes are multifunctional (e.g. supplying both goods, such as timber and food, and services, such as water and biodiversity protection); and although there will be multiple stakeholders, they nonetheless have a common concern about the landscape, negotiate change with each other in a transparent way, and their rights and responsibilities are clear or become clear through the process.&lt;ref name="Ten P"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sayer|first1=J|last2=Sunderland|first2=T|last3=Ghazoul|first3=J et al|title=Ten principles for a landscape approach to reconciling agriculture, conservation, and other competing land uses|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA|date=2013|volume=110|issue=21|pages=8349–8356|doi=10.1073/pnas.1210595110|url=http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/articles/ASunderland1302.pdf|pmc=3666687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Five Elements of Integrated Landscape Management''' describe the implementation cycle of a landscape approach, namely that: "interested stakeholders in the landscape come together for cooperative dialogue and action in a multi-stakeholder platform (1); they undertake a systematic process to exchange information and discuss perspectives to achieve a shared understanding of the landscape conditions, challenges and opportunities (2); this enables collaborative planning to develop an agreed action plan (3); stakeholders then implement the plan, with attention to maintaining collaborative commitments (4); and finally, monitoring for adaptive management and accountability feeds into subsequent rounds of dialogue and the design of new collaborative action (5)".&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt; These five elements can be presented graphically in a circle, similar to the project management cycle.

== Risks and barriers ==
Despite many examples of implementation, and the interest of many public and private sector organisations (see for example participation at global fora on landscapes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Landscape Forum - the Investment Case speakers|url=http://www.landscapes.org/london-2016/speakers/|website=Global Landscape Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Global Landscapes Forum Final Report|url=http://www.landscapes.org/publication/2014-global-landscapes-forum-final-report/|website=Global Landscapes Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;), there are various barriers and risks around landscape approaches. An extensive literature review&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt; identified five main barriers.

The first is '''terminology confusion''': the variety of definitions creates the potential for not only confusion, but also resistance to engage with an approach that has emerged, often somewhat independently, from different fields.&lt;ref name="Reed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt; As stated by Scherr et al.: “People are talking about the same thing without realizing it. This can lead to fragmentation of knowledge, unnecessary re-invention of ideas and practices, and inability to mobilize action at scale. For policymakers, this rich diversity is often simply overwhelming: they receive confusing messages as to what an enabling policy environment to address the full set of landscape values would look like.”&lt;ref name="Scherr" /&gt;

These risks are far from unique to landscape approaches: since the 1970s it has been recognised that the constant emergence of new terms and labels from efforts to improve and integrate policy and practice for rural areas of developing countries can be harmful if they obscure problems or promote rhetoric at the expense of action.&lt;ref name="ODI"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Overseas Development Institute|title=Integrated Rural Development|journal=ODI Briefing Paper|date=1979|issue=04|url=https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/6626.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that landscapes approaches develop from, and aim to integrate, a wide variety of concepts and sectors, makes it vulnerable to overlapping definitions and parallel conceptual development. Like other approaches to conservation, it could be seen as a fad.&lt;ref name="fads"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Redford|first1=K|last2=Padoch|first2=C|last3=Sunderland|first3=T|title=Fads, funding and forgetting in three decades of conservation|journal=Conservation Biology|date=2013|volume=27|issue=3|pages=437–438|doi=10.1111/cobi.12071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further barriers to implementation have been identified. As has been the case with other integrated approaches, '''time lags''' result from the fact that substantial time and resources are invested both in developing concepts and planning projects, while resources are less adequate for implementation, and more limited still for monitoring the outcomes.&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sayer" /&gt; Difficulties in establishing objectives, operating norms and funding that effectively bridge different sectors can lead to '''operating silos'''(where each sector pursues its goals without giving consideration to the others), whether at the level of local actors and institutions within a landscape, national ministries, or donors.&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt; Working across sectors at the landscape scale requires a range of skills, different from those traditionally used by conservation organisations.&lt;ref name="Sayer" /&gt;  Landscape approaches rely on the engagement of multiple stakeholders, which can lead to problems of '''Internal/external engagement''',&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reed" /&gt; if engagement is reduced to a box-ticking exercise or inaccessible to community participants,&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt; or powerful players such as government agencies or large companies can be deterred by a perception that there is too much participatory discussion at the expense of efficient decision-making&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt; The least developed area of landscape approaches is '''monitoring''', to understand whether the ambitious, multiple objectives of the approach have been achieved.&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt;

== Examples ==
Examples of landscape approaches are collated and analysed globally&lt;ref name="LSLB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Minang" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landscapes for People Food and nature case studies http://peoplefoodandnature.org/analysis/all-publications/case-studies/&lt;/ref&gt; or regionally, for example from Africa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milder|first1=J C|last2=Hart|first2=A K|last3=Dobie|first3=P|last4=Minai|first4=J|last5=Zaleski|first5=C|title=Integrated landscape initiatives for Afircan agriculture, development, and conservation: a region-wide assessment|journal=World Development|date=2014|volume=54|pages=68–80|doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2013.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Estrada-Carmona|first1=N|last2=Hart|first2=A K|last3=Declerk|first3=F A J|last4=Harvey|first4=C A|last5=Milder|first5=J C|title=Integrated landscape management for agriculture, rural livelihoods, and ecosystem conservation: an assessment of experience from Latin America and the Caribbean|journal=Landscape and urban planning|date=2014|volume=129|pages=1–11|doi=10.1016/j.landurbplan.2014.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; International organisations have developed programmes that apply the approach to multiple locations worldwide (for example, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] Livelihoods and Landscapes Strategies programme worked in 27 landscapes in 23 different countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Livelihoods and Landscapes|url=https://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/forest/fp_our_work/fp_projects/fp_our_work_ll/fp_livelihoods_landscapes_about/|publisher=IUCN}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Some specific examples of implementation in individual landscapes are as follows.

An example of an indigenous producer movement that is managing a multi-functional landscape is from the [[Potato Park]] in Pisac, Peru, which is an Indigenous Biocultural Heritage Territory, where indigenous communities protect the ecological and cultural diversity of the 12000ha landscape.&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt;

An example of cooperation between very different actors is from the landscape of the [[Doi Mae Salong]] watershed in North-west Thailand, a designated Military Reserved Area under the control of the Royal Thai Armed Forces. Reforestation activities, to address degradation caused by unsustainable land uses, led to tension with local hill tribes. In response, a multi-stakeholder dialogue was used to reach agreement on land rights and use of different parts of the reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=R J|last2=Kugel|first2=C|last3=Rattanasorn|first3=T|title=Unusual partnerships : lessons for landscapes and livelihoods from the Doe Mae Salong landscape, Thailand.|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/10215|website=IUCN|publisher=IUCN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wide image|2014 June 1, Mae Fa Luang District.jpg|1000px|Landscape near the Doi Mae Salong mountain in 2014}}

The [[Mount Kailash]] region is of particular religious and ecological importance, as it is here that the [[Indus River]], the [[Karnali River]] (a major tributary of the [[Ganges River]]), the [[Brahmaputra River]] and the [[Sutlej]] river systems originate. With assistance from the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), the three surrounding countries (China, India and Nepal) developed an integrated management approach to the different conservation and development issues within this landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wallrapp|first1=C|title=Transboundary landscape management in the Kailash Sacred Landscape|url=http://peoplefoodandnature.org/blog/transboundary-landscape-management-in-the-kailash-sacred-landscape/|publisher=Landscapes for People Food and Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Volta River]] basin, [[landscape modelling]] illustrates the cause and effect of alternative scenarios for the riparian buffer, and is used to inform land-use decisions. Six countries in West Africa are using the ‘Mapping Ecosystems Services to Human well-being’ (MESH) toolkit to assess strategies for conserving hydrological [[ecosystem services]] and meeting national SDG commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wood|first1=S|last2=Jones|first2=S|title=Balancing multiple SDG-related outcomes of riparian buffers in the Volta Basin|url=http://peoplefoodandnature.org/blog/balancing-multiple-sdg-related-outcomes-of-riparian-buffers-in-the-volta-basin/|publisher=Landscapes for People Food and Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International conservation NGOs are applying the approach using '''REDD+ financing''', for example [[Conservation International]] is using carbon financing from Disney in the 182,000-hectare [[Alto Mayo Protection Forest]], in the San Martín region of Peru. Smallholders sign up to REDD+ agreements, which provide incentives for them to reduce the rate of local deforestation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Implementing Forest Conservation in Peru’s Alto Mayo Region|url=http://www.conservation.org/stories/alto-mayo-protected-forest/Pages/overview.aspx/|publisher=Conservation International}}&lt;/ref&gt; independent verification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alto Mayo Conservation Initiative 2nd Verification Report|url=http://database.v-c-s.org/sites/v-c-s.org/files/042%20Alto%20Mayo%20VCS+CCB%202nd%20Verification%20Report-v1_Final%2015Jan2015.pdf|publisher=Verified Carbon Standard, The Climate, Community and Biodiversity Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported improvements in living conditions, reduced deforestation, and positive impacts on biodiversity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8802">'''Marketing engineering''' is currently definded as "a systematic approach to harness data and knowledge to drive effective marketing decision making an implementation through a technology-enabled and model-supported decision process".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/840607615|title=Principles of marketing engineering|last=Arvind.|first=Rangaswamy,|last2=de.|first2=Bruyn, Arnaud|date=2013|publisher=DecisionPro|isbn=0985764805|oclc=840607615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term ''marketing engineering'' can be traced back to Lilien et al. in "The Age of Marketing Engineering" published in 1998;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.ama.org/Archive/ResourceLibrary/MarketingManagement/Pages/1998/7/1/679274.aspx|title=The Age of Marketing Engineering.|website=archive.ama.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; in this article the authors define ''marketing engineering'' as the use of [[computer]] [[decision model]]s for making [[marketing]] decisions. [[Marketing manager]]s typically use "conceptual marketing", that is they develop a [[mental model]] of the decision situation based on past experience, intuition and reasoning. That approach has its limitations though: experience is unique to every individual, there is no objective way of choosing between the best judgments of multiple individuals in such a situation and furthermore judgment can be influenced by the person position in the [[Hierarchical organization|firm's hierarchy]]. In same year [[Gary Lilien|Lilien G. L.]] and A. Rangaswamy published ''Marketing Engineering: Computer-Assisted Marketing Analysis and Planning'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/731888669|title=Marketing Engineering : computer assisted marketing analysis and planning|last=Arvind.|first=Rangaswamy,|date=2005|publisher=Trafford|isbn=1412022525|oclc=731888669}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fildes and Ventura''&lt;ref&gt;The Journal of Operational Research Society, Vol. 51, No. 7 (Jul., 2000), pp. 891–892&lt;/ref&gt; praised the book in their review, while noting that a fuller discussion of [[market share]] models and [[econometric model]]s would have made the book better for teaching and that "conceptual marketing" should not be discarded in the presence of marketing engineering, but that both approaches should be used together. Leeflang and Wittink (2000)&lt;ref&gt;P.S.H. Leeflang, D. R. Wittink, Building models for marketing decisions: Past, present and future, International Journal of Research in Marketing, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; have identified five era of model building in marketing:
# (1950-1965) The first era of application of [[operations research]] and [[management science]] to marketing
# (1965-1970) Adaptation of models to fit marketing problems
# (1970-1985) Emphasis on models that are an acceptable representation of reality and are easy to use
# (1985-2000) Increase interest in marketing [[decision support system]]s, [[meta-analyses]] and studies of the generalizability of results
# (2000- .  ) Growth of new exchange systems (ex: [[e-commerce]]) and need for new modeling approaches

How to build market models and how to develop a structured approach to marketing questions has been an issue of active discussion between researchers, L. Lilien and A. Rangaswamy (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lilien|first=Gary L.|last2=Rangaswamy|first2=Arvind|date=2001-06-01|title=The Marketing Engineering Imperative: Introduction to the Special Issue|url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/inte.31.3s.1.9679|journal=Interfaces|volume=31|issue=3_supplement|pages=S1–S7|doi=10.1287/inte.31.3s.1.9679|issn=0092-2102}}&lt;/ref&gt; have observed that while having data gives a competitive advantage, having too much data without the models and systems for working with it may turn out to be as bad as not having the data. Lodish (2001) &lt;ref&gt;Leonard M. Lodish, (2001) Building Marketing Models that Make Money. Interfaces 31(3_supplement):S45-S5&lt;/ref&gt; observed that the most complicated and [[mathematical beauty|elegant model]] will not necessarily be the one adopted in the firm, good models are the ones who capture the [[trade-off]]s of [[decision making]], subjective [[estimate]]s may be necessary to complete the model, risk needs to be taken into account, model complexity must be balanced versus ease of understanding, models should integrate tactical with strategic aspects. Migley (2002)&lt;ref&gt;David Migley, What to codify: marketing science or marketing engineering? Marketing theory 2002&lt;/ref&gt; identifies four purposes in codifying marketing knowledge:
# To facilitate the progress of marketing as a [[science]]
# To promote the discipline within its institutional and professional environments
# To better educate and credential the potential manager
# To provide competitive advantage to the firm
Lilien et al.(2002)&lt;ref&gt;Lilien L.G., Rangaswamy A., van Bruggen Gerrit H.,Wierenga B., Bridging the marketing theory-practice gap with marketing engineering, Journal of Business Research 2002&lt;/ref&gt; define marketing engineering as "the systematic process of putting marketing data and knowledge to practical use through the planning, design, and construction of decision aids and marketing management support systems (MMSSs)". One the driving factors toward the development of marketing engineering are the use of high-powered personal computers connected to [[LAN]]s and [[Wide area network|WAN]]s, the [[Big data|exponential growth in the volume of data]], the reengineering of marketing functions. The effectiveness of the implementation of marketing engineering and MMSSs in the firm depend on the decision situation characteristics(demand), the nature of the MMSS (supply), match between supply and demand, design characteristics of the MMSS, characteristics of implementation process.  Wider adoption depend on difference between end-user systems and high-end systems, user training and the growth of the [[Internet]].

{{Anthropology of religion}}
[[Millenarianism]] has been found through history among people who rally around often-apocalyptic religious prophecies that predict a return to power, the defeat of enemies, and/or the accumulation of wealth. These movements have been especially common among people living under [[colonialism]] or other forces that disrupt previous social arrangements.

The phrase "millennialist movement" has been used by scholars in anthropology and history to describe the common features of these religious phenomena when viewed as [[social movements]], and has most often been used to describe the social movements that have taken place in colonized societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burridge|first=Kenelm|title=New Heaven, New Earth: A study of Millenarian Activities|year=1969|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity itself can be seen as originating in a millenarian movement among [[Jewish people]] living under Roman rule, although its characteristics as a social movement quickly changed as it spread through the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[Book of Revelation]] also predicts a thousand-year reign of [[Jesus]] prior to the defeat of [[Satan]]. 

Some millenarian movements include:
* The [[Ghost Dance]] movement among Native Americans.
* [[Tenskwatawa]] the "Shawnee Prophet" called for return to ancestral ways and defeat of European colonial power.
* The [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] cattle-killing movement of [[South Africa]], led by the prophetess [[Nongqawuse]].
* The [[Righteous Harmony Society]] during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] was a Chinese movement reacting against Western colonialism.
* The [[God Worshipping Society]] of the [[Taiping Rebellion]], which fused Anglo-American [[Protestant]] Christian and Chinese elements into a movement that focused the resentment of [[Han Chinese]] against the ruling [[Manchu]] [[Qing Dynasty]]. [[Hong Xiuquan]], their leader, proclaimed himself to be the second son of [[God]] and brother of [[Jesus Christ]], as well as the [[Son of Heaven|''Tian Zi'' (Son of Heaven)]], a sacred title of the [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperor]]. He would establish the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]], which controlled much of southern China from 1851-1864.  
* The [[Maji Maji Rebellion]] was influenced by an African [[spirit medium]] who gave his followers war medicine that he said would turn German bullets into water.
* [[Bábism]] and [[Bahá'í faith|Bahá'ism]], two [[Perennial philosophy|perennialist]] movements founded in [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Persia]] by self-proclaimed prophets.
* The [[Mahdist State]] in [[Sudan]], which was established by [[Muhammad Ahmad]], who proclaimed himself the [[Mahdi]] and led a [[Mahdist War|jihad]] against the [[History of Sudan (1821-1885)|Khedive of Egypt's rule over the Sudan]] and the [[British Empire]]. 
* [[Chilembwe uprising]] - a 1915 uprising in [[Nyasaland]] led by a millenarian priest
* The Melanesian [[John Frum]] [[cargo cult]] believed in a return of their ancestors brought by Western technology.
* [[Burkhanism]] was an [[Altay people|Altay]]an movement led by a visionary that reacted against [[Russification]].
* The [[Battle of Kuruyuki]] was the 1892 attempt of the [[Eastern Bolivian Guarani]] to combat Christianity and Bolivian settlers.   
* The [[Guaycuru|Guaycuruan]]-speaking [[Toba people|Toba]] attempted to regain control of the [[Gran Chaco]] in Argentina in 1904.
* The [[Tepehuán Revolt]] in 1620s Mexico was an attempt to expel Spanish colonists and priests and return to traditional ways.

'''Montane ecosystems''' refers to any [[ecosystem]] found in [[mountain]]s. These ecosystems are strongly affected by [[alpine climate|climate]], which gets [[lapse rate|colder as elevation increases]]. They are stratified according to elevation. Dense [[forest]]s are common at moderate elevations. However, as the elevation increases, the climate becomes harsher, and the plant community transitions to grasslands or [[tundra]].

==Life zones==
[[File:Mountain-birch-Trollheimen.jpg|thumb|A stand of [[Betula pubescens|mountain birch]] at around 750&amp;nbsp;m in [[Trollheimen]], typical of [[Scandinavia]]n subalpine forests]]

As elevation increases, the [[alpine climate|climate becomes cooler]], due to a decrease in [[atmospheric pressure]] and the [[adiabatic cooling]] of airmasses.&lt;ref name=goodywilson&gt;{{cite book |first1=Richard M. |last1=Goody |first2=James C.G. |last2=Walker |title=Atmospheres |chapter=Atmospheric Temperatures |chapterurl=http://lasp.colorado.edu/~bagenal/3720/GoodyWalker/AtmosCh3sm.pdf |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1972 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729075851/http://lasp.colorado.edu/~bagenal/3720/GoodyWalker/AtmosCh3sm.pdf |archivedate=29 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The change in climate by moving up 100&amp;nbsp;meters on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80&amp;nbsp;kilometers (45&amp;nbsp;miles or 0.75° of [[latitude]]) towards the nearest pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blyth |first1=S. |last2=Groombridge |first2=B. |last3=Lysenko |first3=I. |last4=Miles |first4=L. |last5=Newton |first5=A. |url=http://www.unep-wcmc.org/mountains/mountain_watch/pdfs/WholeReport.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080511044709/http://www.unep-wcmc.org/mountains/mountain_watch/pdfs/WholeReport.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 May 2008 |title=Mountain Watch |year=2002 |publisher=UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre, Cambridge, UK |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristic flora and fauna in the mountains tend to strongly depend on elevation, because of the change in climate. This dependency causes [[life zone]]s to form: bands of similar ecosystems at similar altitude.

One of the typical life zones on mountains is the montane forest: at moderate elevations, the rainfall and temperate climate encourages dense forests to grow. [[Holdridge life zone|Holdridge]] defines the climate of montane forest as having a biotemperature of between {{convert|6|and|12|C|F}}, where biotemperature is the mean temperature considering temperatures below {{convert|0|C|F}} to be {{convert|0|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=lugo&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lugo|first1=Ariel E.|first2=Sandra L.|last2=Brown|first3=Rusty|last3=Dodson|first4=Tom S.|last4=Smith|first5=Hank H.|last5=Shugart|year=1999|title=The Holdridge Life Zones of the conterminous United States in relation to ecosystem mapping|journal=Journal of Biogeography|volume=26|pages=1025–1038|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/global/iitf/pubs/ja_iitf_1999_lugo002.pdf|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.1999.00329.x|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above the elevation of the montane forest, the trees thin out in the subalpine zone, become twisted [[krummholz]], and eventually fail to grow. Therefore, Montane forests often contain trees with twisted trunks. This phenomenon is observed due to the increase in the wind strength with the elevation.The elevation where trees fail to grow is called the [[tree line]]. The biotemperature of the subalpine zone is between {{convert|3|and|6|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=lugo/&gt;

Above the tree line the ecosystem is called the alpine zone or [[alpine tundra]], dominated by grasses and low-growing shrubs. The biotemperature of the alpine zone is between {{convert|1.5|and|3|C|F}}. Many different plant species live in the alpine environment, including  [[perennial grass]]es, [[Cyperaceae|sedges]],  [[forb]]s, [[cushion plant]]s, [[moss]]es, and [[lichen]]s.&lt;ref name=functional&gt;{{Cite book

Alpine plants display adaptations such as rosette structures, waxy surfaces, and hairy leaves. Because of the common characteristics of these zones, the [[World Wildlife Fund]] groups a set of related [[ecoregions]] into the "[[montane grassland and shrubland]]" biome.

Climates with biotemperatures below {{convert|1.5|C|F|0}} tend to consist purely of rock and ice.&lt;ref name=lugo/&gt;

==Montane forest==
[[File:Overlooking Waimea Canyon.jpg|thumb|[[Waimea Canyon]], Hawaii is known for its montane [[vegetation]].]]
Montane forests occur between the [[submontane zone]] and the subalpine zone. The elevation at which one habitat changes to another varies across the globe, particularly by [[latitude]]. The upper limit of montane forests, the [[Tree line|forest line or timberline]], is often marked by a change to hardier species that occur in less dense stands.&lt;ref name=Price/&gt; For example, in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] of [[California]], the montane forest has dense stands of [[lodgepole pine]] and [[red fir]], while the [[Sierra Nevada subalpine zone]] contains sparse stands of [[whitebark pine]].&lt;ref name="Rundel"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rundel|first=P.W.|author2=D.

Montane forests differ from lowland forests in the same area.&lt;ref name=Nagy&gt;{{cite book|title=The biology of alpine habitats|first1=László|last1=Nagy|first2=Georg|last2=Grabherr|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The climate of montane forests is colder than lowland climate at the same latitude, so the montane forests often have species typical of higher-latitude lowland forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Perry | first = David A. | year = 1994 | title = Forest Ecosystems | publisher = JHU Press | isbn = 0-8018-4987-X | page = 49 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWNtHLz3fXYC&amp;pg=PA55 | accessdate = 2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Humans can disturb montane forests through [[forestry]] and [[agriculture]].&lt;ref name=Nagy/&gt; On isolated mountains, montane forests surrounded by treeless dry regions are typical "[[sky island]]" ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Albert | first1 = James S. | last2 = Reis | first2 = Roberto E. | year = 2011 | title = Historical Biogeography of Neotropical Freshwater Fishes | publisher = University of California Press | isbn = 0-520-26868-7 | page = 311 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_Suu7a-ERdMC&amp;pg=PA311 | accessdate = 2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Temperate climate ===
[[File:PitsundaPineGrove.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Pine forest in [[Abkhazia]]]]

Montane forests in temperate climate are typically one of [[temperate coniferous forest]] or [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forest]], forest types that are well known from northern Europe, northern United States, and southern Canada. The trees are, however, often not identical to those found further north: geology and climate causes different related species to occur in montane forests.

Montane forests around the world tend to be more species-rich than those in Europe, because major mountain chains in Europe are oriented east-west.


Montane forests in temperate climate occur in Europe (the [[Alps]], [[Carpathians]], [[Caucasus]] and more), in North America ([[Cascade Range]], [[Klamath-Siskiyou]], [[Appalachians]] and more), south-western South America, [[New Zealand]] and [[Himalaya]].

=== Mediterranean climate ===
[[File:Chase khar - چاسه خار (3).jpg|thumb|right|Iranian oak scrub in the [[Zagros Mountains]]]]
Montane forests in [[Mediterranean climate]] are warm and dry except in winter, when they are relatively wet and mild. These forests are typically mixed conifer and broadleaf forests, with only a few conifer species. [[Pine]] and [[Juniper]] are typical trees found in Mediterranean montane forests. The broadleaf trees show more variety and are often evergreen, e.g. evergreen [[Oak]].

This type of forest is found in the [[Mediterranean Basin]], [[North Africa]], [[Mexico]] and the [[southwestern US]], [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]].

=== Subtropical and tropical climate ===
[[File:Forest on Gunung Batu Brinchang, Malaysia.jpg|thumb|right|Tropical montane forest at around 2,000&amp;nbsp;m in [[Malaysia]]]]

In the tropics, montane forests can consist of [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|broadleaf forest]] in addition to [[tropical coniferous forest|coniferous forest]]. One example of a tropical montane forest is a [[cloud forest]], which gains its moisture from clouds and fog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mulligan | first = M. | title = Tropical Montane Cloud Forests: Science for Conservation and Management | editor = Bruijnzeel, L.

Mossy forests usually develop on the saddles of mountains, where moisture introduced by settling clouds is more effectively retained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=C.M.|year=1997|title=[[Nepenthes of Borneo]]|publisher=Natural History Publications (Borneo)|location=Kota Kinabalu|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on latitude, the lower limit of montane rainforests on large mountains is generally between {{convert|1500|and|2500|m|ft}} while the upper limit is usually from {{convert|2400|to|3300|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruijnzee|first1=L.A.|first2=E.

==Subalpine zone==

The subalpine zone is the [[life zone|biotic zone]] immediately below the [[tree line]] around the world. In tropical regions of [[Southeast Asia]] the tree line may be above {{convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blasco |first=F. |last2=Whitmore |first2=T.C. |last3=Gers |first3=C. |year=2000 |title=A framework for the worldwide comparison of tropical woody vegetation types |journal=Biological Conservation |volume=95 |issue=2 |pages=175–189 |url=http://www.ecolab.ups-tlse.fr/IMG/pdf/BC_Blasco_et_al.2000.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6APmLJTrW?url=http://www.ecolab.ups-tlse.fr/IMG/pdf/BC_Blasco_et_al.2000.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-04 |accessdate=2012-03-11 |doi=10.1016/S0006-3207(00)00032-X |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |df= }} p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Scotland it may be as low as {{convert|450|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Grace |first=John |last2=Berninger |first2=Frank |last3=Nagy |first3=Laszlo |year=2002 |title=Impacts of Climate Change on the Tree Line |journal=Annals of Botany |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=537–544 |doi=10.1093/aob/mcf222 |pmid=12324278 |pmc=4240388 }} fig. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Species that occur in this zone depend on the location of the zone on the Earth, for example, [[snow gum]] in Australia, or [[subalpine larch]], [[mountain hemlock]] and [[subalpine fir]] in western North America.

Trees in the subalpine zone often become [[krummholz]], that is, crooked wood, stunted and twisted in form. At tree line, tree seedlings may germinate on the [[Windward and leeward|lee side]] of rocks and grow only as high as the rock provides wind protection. Further growth is more horizontal than vertical, and additional rooting may occur where branches contact the soil. Snow cover may protect krummholz trees during the winter, but branches higher than wind-shelters or snow cover are usually destroyed. Well-established krummholz trees may be several hundred to a thousand years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/romo/naturescience/subalpine_ecosystem.htm|title=Subalpine ecosystem|work=Rocky Mountain National Park|publisher=U.S. National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Montane grasslands and shrublands|Meadows]] may be found in the subalpine zone. [[Tuolumne Meadows]] in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] of [[California]], is an example of a subalpine meadow.

Example subalpine zones around the world include the [[French Prealps]] in Europe, the [[Sierra Nevada subalpine zone|Sierra Nevada]] and [[Rocky Mountains subalpine zone|Rocky Mountain]] subalpine zones in North America, and subalpine forests in the [[Eastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests|eastern Himalaya]], [[Western Himalayan subalpine conifer forests|western Himalaya]], and [[Hengduan Mountains subalpine conifer forests|Hengduan mountains]] of Asia.

==Alpine grasslands and tundra==

[[Image:GlarusAlps.jpg|thumb|An alpine [[Bog|mire]] in the [[Swiss Alps]]]]
Alpine grasslands and tundra lie above the tree line, in a world of intense radiation, wind, cold, snow, and ice. As a consequence, alpine vegetation is close to the ground and consists mainly of [[perennial grass]]es, [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], and [[forb]]s. Annual plants are rare in this ecosystem and usually are only a few inches tall, with weak root systems.&lt;ref name=blm&gt;{{Include-USGov|agency=[[Bureau of Land Management]]|source={{cite web|url=http://www.blm.gov/wildlife/plan/WY/Alpine%20Tundra%20Grassland.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724070058/http://www.blm.gov/wildlife/plan/WY/Alpine%20Tundra%20Grassland.pdf|archivedate=2008-07-24|title=Grassland Habitat Group}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other common [[plant life-form]]s include [[prostrate shrub]]s, [[grass|graminoids]] forming  [[tussock (grass)|tussocks]], and [[cryptogams]], such as [[bryophytes]] and [[lichens]].&lt;ref name=functional/&gt;

Plants have adapted to the harsh alpine environment. [[Cushion plant]]s, looking like ground-hugging clumps of moss, escape the strong winds blowing a few inches above them. Many flowering plants of the alpine tundra have dense hairs on stems and leaves to provide wind protection or [[anthocyanin|red-colored pigments]] capable of converting the sun's light rays into heat. Some plants take two or more years to form flower buds, which survive the winter below the surface and then open and produce fruit with seeds in the few weeks of summer.&lt;ref name=rockymtn&gt;{{NPS|url=http://www.nps.gov/romo/naturescience/alpine_tundra_ecosystem.htm|article=Rocky Mountain National Park: Alpine Tundra Ecosystem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-flowering [[lichen]]s cling to rocks and soil. Their enclosed [[algae|algal cells]] can [[photosynthesize]] at any temperature above {{convert|0|C|F}}, and the outer fungal layers can absorb more than their own weight in water.

The adaptations for survival of drying winds and cold may make tundra vegetation seem very hardy, but in some respects the tundra is very fragile. Repeated footsteps often destroy tundra plants, leaving exposed soil to blow away, and recovery may take hundreds of years.&lt;ref name=rockymtn/&gt;

Alpine meadows form where sediments from the weathering of rocks has produced soils well-developed enough to support grasses and sedges. Alpine grasslands are common enough around the world to be categorized as a [[biome]] by the [[World Wildlife Fund]]. The biome, called "Montane grasslands and shrublands", often evolved as virtual islands, separated from other montane regions by warmer, lower elevation regions, and are frequently home to many distinctive and [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] plants which evolved in response to the cool, wet [[climate]] and abundant sunlight.

The most extensive montane grasslands and shrublands occur in the [[Neotropic ecozone|Neotropic]] [[páramo]] of the [[Andes Mountains]]. This biome also occurs in the mountains of [[eastern Africa|east]] and [[central Africa]], [[Mount Kinabalu]] of [[Borneo]], highest elevations of the [[Western Ghats]] in South India and the Central Highlands of [[New Guinea]]. A unique feature of many wet tropical montane regions is the presence of giant rosette plants from a variety of plant families, such as ''[[Lobelia]]'' ([[Afrotropic]]), ''[[Puya (genus)|Puya]]'' ([[Neotropic]]), ''[[Cyathea]]'' ([[New Guinea]]), and ''[[Argyroxiphium]]'' ([[Hawaii]]).

Where conditions are drier, one finds montane grasslands, savannas, and woodlands, like the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], and montane [[steppe]]s, like the steppes of the [[Tibetan Plateau]].

'''N-philes''' are group of [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] molecules which are specifically attracted to the [[Carbon–nitrogen bond|C=N bonds]], defying often the selectivity rules of [[electrophilic]] attack. N-philes can often masquerade as electrophiles, where [[acyl]] radicals are excellent examples which interact with [[Pi electrons]] of aryl groups.

'''New Chronology''' is an alternative [[chronology of the ancient Near East]] developed by English Egyptologist [[David Rohl]] and other researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David |last=Rohl|title=The Lost Testament|year=2002|location= UK|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=David |last=Rohl|title= From Eden to Exile | year=2009|page= 2|ref=harv|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; beginning with ''A Test of Time: The Bible - from Myth to History'' in 1995. It contradicts mainstream [[Egyptology]] by proposing a major revision of the established [[Egyptian chronology]], in particular by re-dating Egyptian kings of the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth]] through [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-fifth]] Dynasties, bringing forward conventional dating by up to 350 years. Rohl asserts that the New Chronology allows him to identify some of the characters in the [[Hebrew Bible]] with people whose names appear in archaeological finds.

The New Chronology, one of several proposed radical revisions of the conventional chronology, has not been accepted in academic Egyptology, where the conventional chronology or small variations of it remain standard.&lt;ref name="biblearchaeology.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bennett|first= Chris|title=Temporal Fugues |journal=Journal of Ancient and Medieval Studies|volume=XIII |year=1996|url= http://www.biblearchaeology.org/file.axd?file=temporalfugues.rtf|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amélie Kuhrt]], head of Ancient Near Eastern History at [[University College London]], in one of the standard reference works of the discipline, notes, {{quote|Many scholars feel sympathetic to the critique of weaknesses in the existing chronological framework [...], but most archaeologists and ancient historians are not at present convinced that the radical redatings proposed stand up to close examination.&lt;ref name=Kuhrt&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhrt|first=Amelie|authorlink=Amélie Kuhrt|title=The Ancient Near East c. 3000-330 BC|volume=I |series=Routledge History of the Ancient World series|location=London &amp; New York|year=1995|page= 14|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}
Rohl's most vocal critic has been [[Kenneth Kitchen]], one of the leading experts on biblical history and the author of the standard work on the conventional chronology of the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt]], the period most directly affected by the New Chronology's redating of the Nineteenth to Twenty-fifth Dynasties.

== Rohl's New Chronology ==
[[File:NC Egyptian chronology comparison.png|thumb|Chart comparing the New Chronology of [[David Rohl]] and the [[Egyptian chronology#Conventional chronology|conventional chronology]] of [[Ian Shaw (Egyptologist)|Ian Shaw]]]]

David Rohl's published works ''A Test of Time'' (1995), ''Legend'' (1998), ''The Lost Testament'' (2002), and ''The Lords of Avaris'' (2007) set forth Rohl's theories for re-dating the major civilisations of the ancient world. ''A Test of Time'' proposes a down-dating (bringing closer to the present), by several centuries, of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]], thus needing a major revision of the [[conventional chronology of ancient Egypt]]. Rohl asserts that this would let scholars identify some of the major events in the Hebrew Bible with events in the archaeological record and identify some of the well-known biblical characters with historical figures who appear in contemporary ancient texts. Lowering the Egyptian dates also dramatically affects the dating of dependent chronologies, such as that currently used for the [[Greek Heroic Age]] of the [[Late Bronze Age]], removing the [[Greek Dark Ages]], and lowering the dates of the [[Trojan War]] to within two generations of a ninth-century-BC [[Homer]] and his most famous composition: the ''[[Iliad]]''.

Rejecting the Revised Chronology of [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] and the [[Glasgow Chronology]] presented at the Society for Interdisciplinary Studies's 1978 "Ages in Chaos" conference, the New Chronology lowers the Egyptian dates (established within the traditional chronology) by up to 350 years at points before the universally accepted fixed date of 664 BC for the sacking of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] by [[Ashurbanipal]].

Before the 1995 publication of ''A Test of Time'', [[Thomas L. Thompson]], a [[theology|theologian]] associated with [[Biblical Minimalism]], had insisted that any attempt to write history based on a direct integration of biblical and extra-biblical sources was "not only dubious but wholly ludicrous".&lt;ref name="st131002"/&gt; Rohl explained his view on the issue in ''The Lost Testament'' (2007): "Is the Old Testament history or myth? The only way to answer that question is to investigate the biblical stories using the archaeological evidence, combined with a study of the ancient texts of the civilisations which had a role to play in the Bible story. But this has to be done with an open mind. In my view the biblical text – just like any other ancient document – should be treated as a potentially reliable historical source until it can be demonstrated to be otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Testament'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Rohl had previously remarked in ''A Test of Time'' (1995) that he "did not originally set out to challenge our current understanding of the Old Testament narratives. This has come about simply because of the need to explore the ramifications of my TIP [Egyptian Third Intermediate Period] research. I have no religious axe to grind – I am simply an historian in search of some historical truth."&lt;ref&gt;''A Test of Time'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Rohl's redating is based on criticism of three of the four arguments which he considers are the original foundations of the conventional chronology for the Egyptian New Kingdom:
* He asserts that the identification of "[[Shishak|Shishaq]] [Shishak], King of Egypt" ([[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] 14:25f; [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] 12:2-9) with [[Shoshenq I]], first proposed by [[Jean-François Champollion]], is based on incorrect conclusions. Rohl argues instead that Shishaq should be identified with [[Ramesses II]] (probably pronounced Riamashisha), which would move the date of Ramesses' reign forward some 300 years.
* Rohl also asserts that the record in the [[Ebers Papyrus]] of the [[Sothic cycle|rising of Sirius]] in the ninth [[regnal year]] of [[Amenhotep I]], which is used in conventional chronology to fix that year to either 1542 BC or 1517 BC, has been misread, and instead should be understood as evidence for a reform in the Egyptian calendar. This negative view of Papyrus Ebers is exemplified in a statement by Professor Jürgen von Beckerath who is of the opinion that "The calendar on the verso of the Ebers Medical Papyrus is by now so disputed that we must ask ourselves whether we really possess a sure basis for the chronology of this period of Egyptian history which is, after all, of the greatest importance for fixing the sequence of historical events, as well as for neighbouring countries".&lt;ref&gt;Becherath, J. von, in Helk, W. (ed.) Abstracts for the 'High, Middle or Low? International Colloquium on Chronology held at [[Schloss Haindorf]] (1990), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Wolfgang Helck concludes that "We therefore think it is safer to start from the regnal dates rather than from interpretations of real or supposed Sirius (Sothic) or New Moon dates".&lt;ref&gt;Helck, W. in Helk, W. (ed.) Abstracts for the 'High, Middle or Low? International Colloquium on Chronology held at Schloss Haindorf (1990), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;
* Papyrus Leiden I.350, which dates to the 52nd year of Ramesses II, records a lunar observation which places that year of Ramesses's reign in one of 1278, 1253, 1228 or 1203 BC within the date-range of the conventional chronology. Having questioned the value of the Ebers Papyrus, Rohl argues that, since the lunar cycle repeats itself every 25 years, it is only useful for fine tuning a chronology and could equally apply to dates 300 years later as in the New Chronology.

Thus, Rohl is of the opinion that none of these three foundations of the conventional Egyptian chronology are secure, and that the sacking of Thebes by the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal in 664 BC is the earliest fixed date in Egyptian history.

===Evidence adduced===
Rohl bases his revised chronology (the New Chronology) on his interpretation of numerous archeological finds and genealogical records from Egypt. For example:

* Rohl notes that no [[Apis (deity)|Apis]] bull burials are recorded in the Lesser Vaults at [[Saqqara]] for the [[Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-first]] and early [[Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-second]] Dynasties. He also argues that the reburial sequence of the mummies of the New Kingdom pharaohs in the Royal Cache (TT 320) shows that these two dynasties were contemporary (thus explaining why there are too few Apis burials for the period). Rohl finds that in the royal burial ground at Tanis it appears that the tomb of [[Osorkon II]] of the 22nd Dynasty was built before that of [[Psusennes I]] of the 21st Dynasty; in Rohl's view this can only be explained if the two dynasties were contemporary.
* Rohl offers inscriptions that list three non-royal genealogies which, when one attributes 20 to 23 years to a generation, show, according to Rohl, that Ramesses II flourished in the 10th century BC as Rohl advocates. In the conventional chronology, all three genealogies would be missing seven generations. He also argues that there are no genealogies that confirm the conventional dates for Ramesses II in the 13th century BC.
* One of Rohl's methods is the use of [[archaeoastronomy]], which he employs to fix the date of a near-sunset solar [[eclipse]] during the reign of [[Akhenaten]] and observed from the city of [[Ugarit]]. Based on calculations, using computer astronomy programs, Rohl asserts that the only time when this eclipse could have occurred during the whole second millennium BC was on 9 May 1012 BC. This is approximately 350 years later than the conventional dates for Akhenaten (1353-1334 BC).
* Rohl's dates for Amenemhat III of the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]] in the 17th century BC have found support in the work of astronomer David Lappin, whose research finds matches for a sequence of 37 out of 39 lunar month lengths recorded in 12th Dynasty contracts; the conventional chronology matches at best 21. According to Lappin, this pattern provides "startling" support for Rohl's chronology.&lt;ref name=st131002&gt;''[[The Sunday Times]]'', 13 October 2002, [http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/style/article54642.ece How myth became history]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shishaq===
[[File:Sysw-&amp;-Shyshk.jpg|thumb|Comparison by David Rohl of (first line) the name ''Sysw'' (the [[hypocorism]] of Ramesses II) as it would have been written using 13th to 10th century Proto-Hebrew signs, and (second line) the biblical name Shyshk as it would have been written using ninth to seventh-century Early Hebrew signs. The signs are taken from pottery inscriptions dating to those periods (namely the Lachish VI ostracon and the Izbet Sartah abcedary).]]

Most Egyptologists accept Shishaq as an alternative name for Shoshenq I.&lt;ref&gt;Ash, Paul S. ''David, Solomon and Egypt'' Continuum International Publishing Group - Sheffie (1 Nov 1999) {{ISBN|978-1-84127-021-0}} pp. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Michael David ''The Oxford History of the Biblical World'' Oxford Paperbacks; New edition (26 Jul 2001) {{ISBN|978-0-19-513937-2}} p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Kevin A ''The Campaign of Pharaoh Shoshenq I into Palestine'' Mohr Siebeck 2005 {{ISBN|978-3-16-148270-0}} p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Rohl disputes that Shoshenq's military activity fits the biblical account of Shishaq on the grounds that the two kings' campaigns are completely different and Jerusalem does not appear in the Shoshenq inscription as a subjected town.&lt;ref&gt;''A Test of Time'', pp. 122-27.&lt;/ref&gt; He also points out that Ramesses did campaign against Israel and that he had a short form of his formal name which was in use in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Testament'', pp. 389-96.&lt;/ref&gt; That name was Sysw, whilst the early Hebrew alphabet did not distinguish between S and SH, so the biblical name may have originally been Sysq. Rohl has also argued that the qoph ending may be a later misreading of the early sign for waw which in the tenth century was identical to the seventh century sign for qoph. Thus 7th century Sysq may have been a mistaken later reading of tenth-century Sysw.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Rohl]], [http://thelegendgroup.msatt.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=43&amp;Itemid=90 Shoshenq, Shishak and Shysha], accessed 7 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory that Ramesses II (hypocoristicon ''Sysa''), rather than Shoshenq I, should be identified with the biblical Shishak is not widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grisanti |first1= Michael A |first2= Davd M. |last2=Howard |title=Giving the Sense |publisher= Kregel Academic &amp; Professional |date=1 April 2004 |isbn= 978-0-8254-2892-0 |page=193 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=stMd0QV97IYC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=Shishak+and+Sysw+David+Rohl&amp;num=100&amp;ei=KOd1SvaKKI_-ygTSzuz-Ag&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kevin Wilson agrees only partially with David Rohl. Wilson accepts that there is a mismatch between the triumphal relief of Shoshenq I and the biblical description of King Shishak. However, he does not think that this discrepancy gives sufficient reason for doubting the identification of Shoshenq I with King Shishak of the Bible. Wilson writes about Shoshenq's inscription, "Contrary to previous studies, which have interpreted the relief as a celebration of his Palestine campaign, neither the triumphal relief nor any of its elements can be utilized as a source for historical data about that campaign. … the triumphal relief can unfortunately play no role in the reconstruction of Shoshenq’s campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Wilson |first1= Kevin A. |title= The Campaign of Pharaoh Shoshenq I into Palestine|year= 2005|publisher= Mohr Siebeck|isbn= 3-16-148270-0|page= 65}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wilson's view is not supported by Kenneth Kitchen who states: "That the great topographical list of Shoshenq I at Karnak is a document of the greatest possible value for the history and nature of his campaign against Judah and Israel is now clearly established beyond all dispute, thanks to the labours expended on that list by a series of scholars. However, the composition and interpretation of the list still require further examination and clarification".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Kitchen |first1= Kenneth A.|authorlink=Kenneth Kitchen |title= The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt|year= 1973|publisher=Aris &amp; Phillips|isbn= 9780856680014|page= 432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other leading scholars who have studied the campaign relief point out that it is indeed a unique list of subjected towns and not a copy of an earlier campaign by a more celebrated pharaoh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Noth |first1= M. |title= ZDPV 61|year= 1938|pages= 277–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Albright |first1= W.

==Implications of the New Chronology==

The implications of a radical down-dating of the conventional Egyptian chronology, such as that proposed by Rohl and other revisionists, are complex and wide-ranging. The New Chronology affects the historical disciplines of Old Testament studies, Levantine archaeology, Aegean and Anatolian archaeology and Classical studies, and raises major issues concerning Mesopotamian chronology and its links with Egypt and Anatolia.

===Implications for Egypt and her neighbours===

Redating the reign of Ramesses II to three centuries later than that given by the conventional chronology would reposition the date of the [[Battle of Kadesh]] and revise the linked chronology of Hittite history, and would need a revision of the chronology of Assyrian history before 911 BC. Given the dependence of Hittite chronology on Egyptian chronology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical dictionary of the Hittites |last=Burney |first=Charles Allen |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8108-6564-8 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=74IJytg2XuUC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Hittite+chronology+Egyptian#v=onepage&amp;q=Hittite%20chronology%20Egyptian&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; a lowering of Egyptian dates would result in a lowering of the end of the [[Hittite New Kingdom]] and a resulting reduction (or complete removal) of the Anatolian Dark Age.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lords of Avaris'', Chapter 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Amarna period, a [[chronological synchronism]] between Egypt and Assyria is attested through the correspondence of Pharaoh Akhenaten and a King Ashuruballit. In the conventional chronology, this Ashuruballit is identified with [[Ashur-uballit I]] of the early [[Middle Assyrian Empire]], but the New Chronology has proposed the addition of an otherwise unknown King Ashuruballit "II" during the Middle Assyrian "dark age" as the author of the [[Amarna letters]]. Given that the Ashuruballit I synchronism with Akhenaten has become the crucial link between Egyptian and Mesopotamian history in recent years, this issue is a key area of focus and dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Kitchen, Preface to the 2nd edition of ''TIPE''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implications for the Bible===

As explained above, the New Chronology rejects the identification of Shoshenq I with the biblical Shishaq,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newchronology.org/cgi-bin/somsid.cgi?session=1251460988&amp;page=html/volumes/06|title=ISIS - Journal of the Ancient Chronology Forum|work=newchronology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instead offers Ramesses II (also known by his nickname "Sysa") as the real historical figure behind the Shishaq narrative.

Rohl identifies [[Labaya]], a local ruler in Canaan whose activities are documented in the Amarna Letters, with [[Saul]], and identifies [[David]] with Dadua ("Tadua"), also mentioned in Amarna Letter EA256. Saul and Labaya share the same demise - "both die in battle - against a coalition of city states from the coastal plain - on or near [[Mount Gilboa]], both as a result of betrayal."&lt;ref name=st131002/&gt; Both also have a surviving son whose name translates as "Man of Baal."

The New Chronology places [[Solomon]] at the end of the wealthy Late Bronze Age rather than in the relatively impoverished Early Iron Age. Rohl and other New Chronology researchers contend that this fits better with the Hebrew Bible's description of Solomon's wealth.&lt;ref name=st131002/&gt;

Furthermore, Rohl shifts the Israelite Sojourn, Exodus and Conquest from the end of the Late Bronze Age to the latter part of the Middle Bronze Age (from the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]] to the Thirteenth/Hyksos period). Rohl claims that this solves many of the problems associated with the historicity issue of the biblical narratives. He makes use of the archaeological reports from [[Avaris]], in the eastern [[Nile Delta]], which show that a large Semitic-speaking population lived there during the Thirteenth Dynasty. These people were culturally similar to the population of Middle Bronze Age (MB IIA) Canaan. Rohl identifies these Semites as the people upon whom the biblical tradition of the Israelite Sojourn in Egypt was subsequently based.

Towards the end of the Middle Bronze Age (late MB IIB) archaeologists have revealed a series of city destructions which John Bimson and Rohl have argued correspond closely to the cities attacked by the Israelite tribes in the Joshua narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newchronology.org/cgi-bin/somsid.cgi?session=1251460988&amp;page=html/volumes/02|title=ISIS - Journal of the Ancient Chronology Forum|work=newchronology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohl ''A Test of Time'', Chapter 14, pp. 299-325&lt;/ref&gt; Most importantly, the heavily fortified city of Jericho was destroyed and abandoned at this time. On the other hand, there was no city of Jericho in existence at the end of the Late Bronze Age, drawing William Dever to conclude that "Joshua destroyed a city that wasn’t even there".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dever|first1=William G.|title=Recent Archeological Discoveries and Biblical Research|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ab7_GFJ-dKQC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=Dever+Joshua+destroyed+even+there&amp;hl=en|accessdate=2013-01-07|year=1990|origyear=1989|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=USA|isbn=0-295-97261-0|page=47|chapter=2. The Israelite Settlement in Canaan. New Archeological Models|quote=(Of course, for some, that only made the Biblical story more miraculous than ever&amp;mdash;Joshua destroyed a city that wasn't even there!)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rohl claims that it is this lack of archaeological evidence to confirm biblical events in the Late Bronze Age which lies behind modern scholarly skepticism over the reliability of the Hebrew Bible narratives before the Divided Monarchy period. He gives the example of Israeli professor of archaeology, [[Ze'ev Herzog]], who caused an uproar in Israel and abroad when he gave voice to the "fairly widespread" view held among his colleagues that "there had been no Exodus from Egypt, no invasion by Joshua and that the Israelites had developed slowly and were originally Canaanites,"&lt;ref name="Sturgis"&gt;M. Sturgis, ''It Ain’t Necessarily So: Investigating the Truth of the Biblical Past'' (Headlin, London, 2001), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; concluding that the Sojourn, Exodus and Conquest was “a history that never happened.”&lt;ref name="Sturgis" /&gt; However, Rohl contends that the New Chronology, with the shift of the Exodus and Conquest events to the Middle Bronze Age, removes the principal reason for that widespread academic skepticism.

==Identifications in the New Chronology==

===Personal identifications===

Rohl identifies:
*[[Nebkaure Khety]] IV (16th Pharaoh of the 10th Dynasty) with the Pharaoh who had dealings with [[Abraham]].
*[[Amraphel]] (Genesis 14) with [[Amar-Sin]], king of [[Sumer]] (1834-1825 BC/BCE by Rohl's chronology).
*[[Tidal (Bible)]], King of Goyim/King of Nations (Genesis 14), with [[Tishdal]], [[Hurrian]] ruler from the [[Zagros]] mountains.
*Zariku, governor of [[Ashur]], with king [[Arioch]] of [[Ellasar]].
*Kutir-Lagamar of [[Elam]] with [[Chedorlaomer]] of Elam.
*[[Amenemhat III]] with the Pharaoh of Joseph, and [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] with the [[Vizier]] of Amenemhat III.
* The "new king who did not know Joseph" in Exodus 1:8 is identified by Rohl with [[Sobekhotep III]].{{Request quotation|date=September 2017}}
*[[Neferhotep I]] with the adoptive grandfather of [[Moses]].
*[[Sobekhotep IV|Khanefere Sebekhotep IV]], brother and successor of Neferhotep, with Khenephres, the Pharaoh from whom Moses fled to [[Midian]].
*The [[Pharaoh of the Exodus]] with Manetho's Tutimaeus, whom Rohl identifies with [[Dedumose II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rohl|first1=David|title=An Alternative to the Velikovskian Chronology of Ancient Egypt|url=http://davidrohl.blogspot.co.uk/|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ibni]], [[Middle Bronze Age]] ruler of [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], with [[Jabin]], king of Hazor in Joshua 11:10.
*[[Akish]] or [[Achish]], king of Gath, is identified with [[Šuwardata]], King of [[Gath (city)|Gath]] in the Amarna letters. ''Akish'' is believed to be a shortened form of the [[Hurrian]] name ''Akishimige'', "the Sun God has given." Shuwardata is an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] name meaning "the Sun God has given."
*[[Aziru]] of the Amarna Letters is identified with [[Hadadezer bar Rehob|Hadadezer]], Syrian king in II Samuel.
*[[Labaya]], a ruler in the [[Amarna Letters]], with [[King Saul]].
*[[King David]] with Dadua in Amarna Letter [[Amarna letter EA 256|EA 256]].
*[[Mutbaal]], writer of the letter, is identified with Ishbaal (aka [[Ishbosheth]]). The two names have exactly the same meaning: "Man of Baal." Following the death of his father (Labaya/Saul), Mutbaal/Ishbaal moved his center to [[Transjordan (Bible)|Transjordan]].
*"The Sons of Labaya," in the [[Amarna Letter EA 250|Amarna Letter 250]], with Mutbaal/Ishbaal and David/Dadua, the latter being the son-in-law of Labaya/Shaul.
*Benemina, also mentioned in [[Amarna letter EA 256|EA 256]], is identified by Rohl with Baanah, Israelite chieftain in II Samuel 4, who would later betray and assassinate Ishbosheth.
*Yishuya, also mentioned in [[Amarna letter EA 256|EA 256]], is identified with [[Jesse]] (''Ishai'' in Hebrew), father of David.
*Ayab, the subject of [[Amarna letter EA 256|EA 256]], is held to be the same as the Biblical [[Yoav]] (English "[[Joab]]").
*Lupakku ("Man of Pakku"), Aramean army commander in the Amarna Letters, with Shobach ("He of Pakku"{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}), Aramean army commander in the Bible.
*[[Nefertiti]] with [[Neferneferuaten]] and with [[Smenkhkare]].
*[[Horemheb]] is identified with the Pharaoh who destroyed [[Gezer]] and later gave it to [[Solomon]], together with one of his daughters as a wife. When Horemhab took Gezer he was not yet the ruler, but was acting under [[Tutankhamun]]. However, he became Pharaoh not long after, and Tutankhamun died too young to have left any marriageable daughters.
*[[Ramses II]] ([[hypocoristicon]] = Shysha) with [[Shishaq]] in the Bible.
*[[Chancellor Bay|Irsu the Syrian]], who took over control of Egypt according to the [[Harris Papyrus]], with Arza, Master of the Palace of Israel according to I Kings 16:8-10.
*[[Sheshi]], a [[Hyksos]] ruler, with [[Sheshai]], a ruler of [[Hebron]] descended from [[Anak]] (Joshua 15:13-15).
*Io of the Line of [[Inachus]] with Queen [[Ahhotep I|Ahhotep]] of the 17th Dynasty of Egypt at Waset
*[[Cadmus#Founder of Thebes|Cadmus of Thebes]] with Cadmus in the line of Pelasgian rulers of Crete
*[[Inachus]] with [[Khyan|Anak-idbu Khyan]] of the Greater Hyksos
*[[Apepi (pharaoh)|Auserre Apepi]] of the Greater Hyksos with [[Epaphus]]
*[[Cush (Bible)|Cush]], son of biblical [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] with [[Meskiagkasher]] of the First Dynasty of [[Uruk]]
*[[Nimrod]], son of biblical [[Cush (Bible)|Cush]] with [[Enmerkar]] ('Enmer the Hunter') of the First Dynasty of Uruk

===Geographical identifications===

Rohl, in addition to his chronology, also has some geographical ideas that are different from the conventional notions. These include:

*The [[Garden of Eden]] (the urheimat [homeland] of the Sumerians), according to Rohl, was located in what is now [[Tabriz#Early accounts|northwestern Iran]], between [[Lake Urmia]] and the [[Caspian Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Testament'', pp. 16-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[The Tower of Babel]], according to Rohl, was built in the ancient Sumerian capital of [[Eridu]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Testament''&lt;/ref&gt;
*The site of the ancient city of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] is "a little over 100 metres beneath the surface of the [[Dead Sea]]," a few kilometers south-by-southeast from [[En-Gedi]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Testament'', pp. 120-124.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Amalekites]] defeated by [[King Saul]] were not the ones living in the [[Negev]] and/or the [[Sinai]], but a northern branch of this people, "in the territory of Ephraim, on the highlands of Amalek" - or, in an alternative translation "in the Land of Ephraim, the mountains of the Amalekites" (Judges 12:15). This is supported by the report that, immediately following his destruction of the Amalekites, "Saul went to Carmel and set up a monument" (I Samuel 15:12). Once Saul is removed from the Negev and the Sinai, "Saul's kingdom as described in the Bible is precisely the area ruled over by [[Labaya]] according to the el-Amarna letters."&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Testament'', p. 318)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===In Egyptology===
Most Egyptologists have not adopted the New Chronology,&lt;ref name="biblearchaeology.org" /&gt; continuing to employ the standard chronology in mainstream academic and popular publications. Rohl's most vocal critic has been Professor [[Kenneth Kitchen]], formerly of [[Liverpool University]], who called Rohl's thesis "100% nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Symbiosis, symbolism, and the power of the past: Canaan, ancient Israel, and their neighbors from the Late Bronze Age through Roman Palaestina |editor1-last=Dever |editor1-first=William G. |last=Kitchen |first=Kenneth |authorlink= |others=Seymour Gitin |chapter=Egyptian interventions in the Levant in Iron Age II |year=2003 |publisher=Eisenbrauns |location= |isbn=978-1-57506-081-1 |pages=113–132 [122] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KK3eFcbIGN0C&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=Rohl+Kitchen#v=onepage&amp;q=Rohl%20Kitchen&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, other Egyptologists recognise the value of Rohl's work in challenging the bases of the Egyptian chronological framework. Professor Erik Hornung acknowledges that "...there remain many uncertainties in the Third Intermediate Period, as critics such as David Rohl have rightly maintained; even our basic premise of 925 [BC] for Shoshenq’s campaign to Jerusalem is not built on solid foundations."&lt;ref&gt;Hornung, E. et al.: "Ancient Egyptian Chronology" (Handbook of Oriental Studies I, vol. 83, Brill, Leiden, 2006), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Academic debate on the New Chronology, however, has largely not taken place in Egyptological or archaeological journals. Most discussions are to be found in the [[Institute for the Study of Interdisciplinary Sciences]]' ''Journal of the Ancient Chronology Forum'' (1985–2006).&lt;ref&gt;ISIS archive, [http://www.newchronology.org Journal of the Ancient Chronology Forum].&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Bennett (1996),&lt;ref name="biblearchaeology.org"/&gt; while saying "I am quite certain that Rohl’s views are wrong" notes that besides academic debate on problems with the conventional chronology, such as those associated with the [[Thera eruption]], a "far deeper challenge ... has been mounted in the public arena." The history of this challenge to mainstream consensus outside of academic debate originates with the 1991 ''Centuries of Darkness'' by [[Peter James (historian)|Peter James]], together with Rohl, co-founder of the [[Institute for the Study of Interdisciplinary Sciences]]. ''Centuries of Darkness'' postulated 250 years of non-existent "phantom time" in the conventional chronology based on an archaeological "Dark Age".&lt;ref&gt;"In a special review issue of the ''Cambridge Archaeological Journal'' these proposals were roundly rejected by experts in all disciplines in Old World archaeology, a result virtually assured by the failure of the authors to present more than an outline restructuring for Egyptian chronology." Bennett (1996:2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth Kitchen's arguments against the New Chronology have focused on Rohl's Third Intermediate Period revision which proposes an overlap between the 21st and 22nd Dynasties. In particular Kitchen challenges the validity of the chronological anomalies raised by Rohl, questioning whether they are true anomalies and offering his own explanations for the apparent problems raised by Rohl. Kitchen accuses New Chronologists of being obsessed with trying to close gaps in the archaeological record by lowering the dating.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Grouping all radical revisions of Egyptian chronology together without distinction, [[Erik Hornung]], in his Introduction to the ''Handbook of Ancient Egyptian Chronology'', makes the following statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We will always be exposed to such attempts, but they could only be taken seriously if not only the arbitrary dynasties and rulers, but also their contexts, could be displaced.... In the absence of such proofs we can hardly be expected to "refute" such claims, or even to respond in any fashion ... It is thus neither arrogance nor ill-will that leads the academic community to neglect these efforts which frequently lead to irritation and distrust outside of professional circles (and are often undertaken with the encouragement of the media). These attempts usually require a rather lofty disrespect of the most elementary sources and facts and thus do not merit discussion. We will therefore avoid discussion of such issues in our handbook, restricting ourselves to those hypotheses and discussions which are based on the sources.&lt;ref&gt;Hornung, E. et al.: "Ancient Egyptian Chronology" (Handbook of Oriental Studies I, vol. 83, Brill, Leiden, 2006), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bennett (1996), whilst not accepting Rohl's thesis, suggests that such out-of-hand rejection may be inappropriate in Rohl's case, since "there is a world of difference between [Rohl's] intellectual standing and that of Velikovsky, or even Peter James" since, unlike "popular radicalisms" such as those of [[Immanuel Velikovsky|Velikovsky]], [[Robert Bauval|Bauval]] or [[Graham Hancock|Hancock]], "Rohl has a considerable mastery of his material."

Professor [[Amélie Kuhrt]], head of Ancient Near Eastern History at University College, London, in one of the standard reference works of the discipline, states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;An extreme low chronology has been proposed recently by a group devoted to revising the absolute chronology of the Mediterranean and Western Asia: P. James et al., ''Centuries of Darkness'', London, 1991; similar, though slightly diverging revisions, are upheld by another group, too, and partly published in the ''Journal of the Ancient Chronology Forum''. The hub for the dating of other cultures is Egypt, so much of the work of both groups focuses on Egyptian evidence. Many scholars feel sympathetic to the critique of weaknesses in the existing chronological framework presented in these volumes, but most archaeologists and ancient historians are not at present convinced that the radical redatings proposed stand up to close examination.&lt;ref name=Kuhrt/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Radiocarbon dating===
In 2010 a series of corroborated [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dates]] were published for dynastic Egypt which suggest some minor revisions to the conventional chronology, but do not support Rohl's proposed revisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Christopher Bronk Ramsey et al., |title=Radiocarbon-Based Chronology for Dynastic Egypt, |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/328/5985/1554 |journal=''Science'' Vol. 328. no. 5985 (18 June 2010), pp. 1554 - 1557.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular media===
In 1995 Rohl published his version of the New Chronology, in the best-selling book ''A Test of Time'', accompanied by a 1995 Channel 4 three-part series ''Pharaohs and Kings - A Biblical Quest''. ''A Test of Time'' takes up the general scenario presented by James, adding many details omitted in 1991, including the "dramatic results" pertaining to [[Biblical chronology]]. Whilst the New Chronology has not been broadly accepted in academia, it has been widely disseminated to the public since the 1990s via Rohl's best-selling&lt;ref&gt;''A Test of Time'' stayed in the top ten ''[[Sunday Times]]'' bestseller list for eight weeks in 1995 (from 17 September to 6 November, pp. 7-14).&lt;/ref&gt; books and the 1995 [[Channel 4]] television documentary, aired in the United States in 1996 on [[The Learning Channel]]. Berthoud (2008) contrasts the "near-unanimous" rejection of Rohl's theories in Egyptology with the "sensational effect" his books, combined with the television series, had on the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Berthoud, J-M. ''Creation Bible Et Science'', 2008, {{ISBN|978-2-8251-3887-8}}, 244f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction of some leading figures from the academic establishment has been very hostile. Kenneth Kitchen presented a "savage review" of ''Centuries of Darkness'' in the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', and the [[British Museum]] banned ''A Test of Time'' from its museum store.&lt;ref&gt;Alden Bass (2003), [http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/2503 Which Came First, the Pyramids or the Flood?], ''Apologetics Press :: Reason &amp; Revelation'', November 2003 - 23[11]:97-101&lt;/ref&gt;

===By evangelicals===

In December 1999 the Dutch language internet journal ''Bijbel, Geschiedenis en Archeologie'' (Bible, History and Archaeology) devoted space to a debate about Rohl's New Chronology. According to evangelical scholar, J.G. van der Land, editor of the journal, Rohl's time-line resolves some archaeological anomalies surrounding ancient Egypt, but creates conflicts with other areas that make it untenable.&lt;ref name=vanderland&gt;van der Land, J.G. (2000) "[http://www.bga.nl/en/discussion/echroroh.html Pharaohs and the Bible: David Rohl's chronology untenable]", ''Bijbel, Geschiedenis en Archeologie'', December 1999&lt;/ref&gt; His arguments were then countered by Peter van der Veen and Robert Porter.&lt;ref name=vanderveen&gt;van der Veen, P.G. (2000) "[http://www.bga.nl/en/discussion/engveen.html Is Rohl's Chronology inaccurate? A reply to BGA']," ''Bijbel, Geschiedenis en Archeologie'', December 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Porter&gt;Porter, R.M. (2000) "[http://www.bga.nl/en/discussion/enfilpo.html 'Did the Philistines settle in Canaan around 1200 BC?]", ''Bijbel, Geschiedenis en Archeologie'', December 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In the final article in the issue, van der Land identified some new issues for Rohl's chronology arising from recent finds in Assyrian letters.&lt;ref&gt;van der Land, J.G. (2000), "[http://www.bga.nl/en/discussion/engbaboe.html Conclusive evidence against Rohl's proposed New Chronology: An Assyrian chancellor's archive"], ''Bijbel, Geschiedenis en Archeologie'', December 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perversion''' is a type of [[human behavior]] that [[Deviance (sociology)|deviates]] from that which is understood to be [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] or [[normal (behavior)|normal]]. Although the term ''perversion'' can refer to a variety of forms of deviation, it is most often used to describe [[Human sexual activity|sexual behaviors]] that are considered particularly abnormal, repulsive or [[sexual obsessions|obsessive]]. Perversion differs from deviant behavior, in that the latter covers areas of behavior (such as petty crime) for which ''perversion'' would be too strong a term. It is often considered [[pejorative|derogatory]], and, in [[psychological]] literature, the term ''[[paraphilia]]'' has been used as a replacement,&lt;ref name="Martins"&gt;Martins, Maria C.; co-author Ceccarelli, Paulo. [http://www.ceccarelli.psc.br/artigos/ingles/html/thesocalled.htm ''The So-called "Deviant" Sexualities: perversion or right to difference?''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303003854/http://www.ceccarelli.psc.br/artigos/ingles/html/thesocalled.htm |date=2006-03-03 }} Presented in the 16th World Congress. "Sexuality and Human Development: From Discourse to Action." 10–14 March 2003 Havana, Cuba.&lt;/ref&gt; though this term is controversial, and ''deviation'' is sometimes used in its place.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Skynner/John Cleese, ''Families and How to Survive them'' (London 1994) p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of concept==
One view is that the concept of perversion is subjective,&lt;ref name="Martins"/&gt; and its application varies depending on the individual. Another view considers that perversion is a degradation of an objectively true morality.  Originating in the 1660s a pervert was originally defined as "one who has forsaken a doctrine or system regarded as true, apostate."&lt;ref name="etymonlinepervert"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pervert|title=Pervert|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sense of a pervert as a sexual term was derived in 1896, and applied originally to variants of sexualities or sexual behavior believed harmful by the individual or group using the term.

==Non-sexual usages==
The verb ''pervert'' is less narrow in reference than the related nouns, and can be used without any sexual connotations.&lt;ref name="dicpervert"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pervert|title=Pervert|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in English law for the crime of [[perverting the course of justice]] which is a common law offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/perverting_the_course_of_justice/|title=Perverting the course of justice|date=1 July 2011|website=The Crown Prosecution Service|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a transition to the sexual in 'the technique of purposeful perversion' of conversational remarks: "Purposeful perversion of what a woman has said ... is a long step closer to a direct attempt at seduction or rape."&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman, ''Rationale of the Dirty Joke Vol I'' (Panther 1973) p. 238–9)&lt;/ref&gt;

The noun sometimes occurs in abbreviated [[slang]] form as "perv" and used as a verb meaning "to act like a pervert", and the adjective "pervy" also occurs. All are often, but not exclusively, used non-seriously.

In [[economics]] the term "[[perverse incentive]]" means a policy that results in an effect contrary to the policymakers' intention.

==Sexual usages==

===Freud on the role of perversion===
[[Freud]]'s didactic strategy in his ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'' was to construct a bridge between the "perversions" and "normal" sexuality. Clinically exploring "a richly diversified collection of erotic endowments and inclinations: [[hermaphroditism]], [[pedophilia]], [[sodomy]], [[fetishism]], [[exhibitionism]], [[Sadomasochism|sadism]], [[Sadomasochism|masochism]], [[coprophilia]], [[necrophilia]]" among them, Freud concluded that "all humans are innately perverse".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud: A Life for our Time'' (London 1988) p. 145–6&lt;/ref&gt; He found the roots of such perversions in infantile sexuality—in 'the child's "polymorphously perverse" inclinations ... the "aptitude" for such perversity is innate'.&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; The 'crucial irony of Freud's account in the ''Three Essays'' was that perversion in childhood ''was'' the norm'.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Fliratation'' (London 1994) p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;
Refining his analysis a decade later, Freud stressed that while [[childhood sexuality]] involved a wide and unfocused range of perverse activities, by contrast with adult perversion there was 'an important difference between them. Perverse sexuality is as a rule excellently centred: all its activities are directed to an aim—usually a single one; one component instinct has gained the upper hand...In that respect there is no difference between perverse and normal sexuality other than the fact that their dominating component instincts and consequently their sexual aims are different. In both of them, one might say, a well-organized tyranny has been established, but in each of the two a different family has seized the reins of power'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 365&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later, in "A Child is Being Beaten" (1919), Freud laid greater stress on the fact that perversions "go through a process of development, that they represent an end-product and not an initial manifestation ... that the sexual aberrations of childhood, as well as those of mature life, are ramifications of the same complex"&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 169 and p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;—the [[Oedipus complex]]. [[Otto Fenichel]] took up the point about the defensive function of perversions—of "experiences of sexual satisfactions which simultaneously gave a feeling of security by denying or contradicting some fear";&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; adding that while "some people think that perverts are enjoying some kind of more intense sexual pleasure than normal people. This is not true ... [though] neurotics, who have repressed perverse longings, may envy the perverts who express the perverse longings openly".&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arlene Richards on the role of perversion in women===
Freud wrote extensively on perversion in men. However, he and his successors paid scant attention to perversion in women. In 2003, psychologist, psychoanalyst and feminist Arlene Richards published a seminal paper on female perversion, "A Fresh look at Perversion", in the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association.&lt;ref&gt;Arlene K. Richards (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, psychoanalyst Lynn Friedman, in a review of The Complete Works of Arlene Richards in the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association, noted prior to that time, "virtually no analysts were writing about female perversion. This pioneering work undoubtedly paved the way for others, including Louise Kaplan (1991), to explore this relatively uncharted territory."&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Friedman (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The permissive society===
[[File:Chikan Sign 3.jpg|thumb|A [[sign]] in [[Suita, Osaka|Suita city]], [[Osaka prefecture]], [[Japan]], warns 'Beware of Perverts'.]]
{{Main|Permissive society}}
With the [[sexual revolution]] of the later twentieth century, much that Freud had argued for became part of a new, wide-ranging liberal consensus, a quasi-normative belief that "everyone's entitled to his own sex life...Some people fancy black rubber clothes. Consenting adults and all that".&lt;ref&gt;[[Russell Hoban]], ''The Lion of Boaz-Jachin and Jachin-Boaz'' (London 1974) p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; At times this might lead to a kind of [[Panglossianism|Panglossian]] world view where every [[Sexual fetishism|fetishist]] has his "fetishera ... for every man who is hung up on shoes, there is a woman ready to cater for and groove with him, and for every man who gets his thrills from hair, there is a woman who gets hers from having her [[The Rape of the Lock|locks raped]]. [[Havelock Ellis]] has many cases of this meeting of the minds: the man who yearns to get pressed on by high heels sooner or later meets the woman who has daydreamed all her life of heel-pressing".&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Berne]], ''Sex in Human Loving'' (Penguin 1970) p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Where internal controversy did arise in the liberal consensus was about the exact relation of variations to normal development - some considering in the wake of Freud that "these different sexual orientations can best be explained and understood by comparison with normal development",&lt;ref&gt;Skynner/Cleese, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; and highlighting the [[fear of intimacy]] in perversion as "a kind of sex ... which is hedged about with special conditions...puts ''a vast distance'' between the partners".&lt;ref&gt;Skynner/Cleese, p. 290–1&lt;/ref&gt; From such a standpoint, "whatever the deviant impulse or fantasy may be, that's where the real, true, loving sexuality is hidden"&lt;ref&gt;Skynner/Cleese, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;—a point of transition perhaps to some of the bleaker post-permissive visions of perversion.

===Critical views===
For some participants, "Liberation, at least in its sexual form, was a new kind of imposed morality, quite as restricting" as what had gone before—one that "took very little account of the complexity of human emotional connections"&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny Diski]], ''The Sixties'' (London 2009) p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; and was driven by 'the superego injunction to enjoy that permeates our discourse'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Slavoj Zizek]], ''The Parallax View'' (London 2006) p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; New, more sceptical currents of disenchantment with perversion emerged as a result (alongside more traditional condemnations) in both the French-speaking and English-speaking worlds.

[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] had early highlighted "the [[ambivalence]] proper to the 'partial drives' of scoptophilia, [[sadomasochism]] ... the often very little 'realised' aspect of the apprehension of others in the practice of certain of these perversions".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 19960 p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; In his wake, others would stress how "there is always, in any perverse act, an aspect of rape, in the sense that the Other must find himself drawn into the experience despite himself ... a loss or abandonment of subjectivity."&lt;ref&gt;Jean Clavreul, "The Perverse Couple", in Stuart Schneiderman ed., ''Returning to Freud'' (New York 1980) p. 227–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[object relations theory]] would point to the way "in perversion there is the refusal, the terror of strangeness"; to the way "the 'pervert'...attacks imaginative elaboration through compulsive action with an accomplice; and this is done to mask psychic pain".&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Kissing, Tickling and Being Bored'' (London 1994) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical studies would find "in the perverse relationships described...an absolute absence of any shared pleasures";&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; while at the theoretical level "perversions involve—the theory tells us—an attempted denial of the difference between the sexes and the generations", and include "the wish to damage and dehumanize ... the misery of the driven, damaging life".&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' p. 108, Raymond Harris, III The Pervert.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John's Diner by John Baeder.jpg|thumb|right|375px|''John's Diner with John's Chevelle'', 2007&lt;br&gt;[[John Baeder]], oil on canvas, 30×48 inches.]]

'''Photorealism''' is a genre of art that encompasses [[painting]], [[drawing]] and other graphic media, in which an artist studies a [[photograph]] and then attempts to reproduce the image as realistically as possible in another [[Medium (arts)|medium]]. Although the term can be used broadly to describe artworks in many different media, it is also used to refer specifically to a group of paintings and painters of the American [[art movement]] that began in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

==History==

===Origins===
As a full-fledged art movement, Photorealism evolved from [[Pop Art]]&lt;ref name="Supperrealist Pop Art"&gt;Lindey (1980), pp. 27–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002. pp 14-15"&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nochlin&gt;[[Nochlin, Linda]], "The Realist Criminal and the Abstract Law II", ''Art In America.'' 61 (November–December 1973), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a counter to [[Abstract Expressionism]]&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002. pp 14-15"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nochlin /&gt; as well as [[Minimal art|Minimalist art movements]]&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002. pp 14-15"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nochlin /&gt;&lt;ref name=fleming709 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Battock, Gregory 1980. pp 8-10"&gt;Battock, Gregory. Preface to [[Louis K. Meisel|Meisel, Louis K.]] (1980), ''Photorealism''. New York:[[Harry N. Abrams|Abrams]]. pp 8–10&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the United States.&lt;ref name="Battock, Gregory 1980. pp 8-10"/&gt;  Photorealists use a photograph or several photographs to gather the information to create their paintings and it can be argued that the use of a [[camera]] and photographs is an acceptance of [[Modernism]].&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt; However, the admittance to the use of photographs in Photorealism was met with intense criticism when the movement began to gain momentum in the late 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that visual devices had been used since the fifteenth century to aid artists with their work.&lt;ref name="Scharf, Aaron"&gt;Scharf, Aaron (1969), ''Art and Photography'' Baltimore: Allan Lane, The Penguin Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of photography in the nineteenth century had three effects on art: portrait and scenic artists were deemed inferior to the photograph and many turned to photography as careers; within nineteenth- and twentieth-century art movements it is well documented that artists used the photograph as source material and as an aid—however, they went to great lengths to deny the fact fearing that their work would be misunderstood as imitations;&lt;ref name="Scharf, Aaron"/&gt; and through the photograph's invention artists were open to a great deal of new experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002), pp. 11–14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the culmination of the invention of the photograph was a break in art's history towards the challenge facing the artist—since the earliest known cave drawings—trying to replicate the scenes they viewed.&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt;

By the time the Photorealists began producing their bodies of work the photograph had become the leading means of reproducing reality and abstraction was the focus of the art world.&lt;ref&gt;Chase, pp. 12–14.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] continued as an ongoing art movement, even experiencing a reemergence in the 1930s, but by the 1950s modernist critics and Abstract Expressionism had minimalized realism as a serious art undertaking.&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Superrealist 1"/&gt;  Though Photorealists share some aspects of American realists, such as [[Edward Hopper]], they tried to set themselves as much apart from traditional realists as they did Abstract Expressionists.&lt;ref name="Superrealist 1"&gt;Lindey (1980), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Photorealists were much more influenced by the work of [[Pop Art|Pop artists]] and were reacting against Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;Lindey (1980), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pop Art and Photorealism were both reactionary movements stemming from the ever-increasing and overwhelming abundance of photographic media, which by the mid 20th century had grown into such a massive phenomenon that it was threatening to lessen the value of imagery in art.&lt;ref name="Supperrealist Pop Art"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chase, p. 14"&gt;Chase, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prown 1977"&gt;Prown, Jules David and Rose, Barbara (1977), ''American Painting: From the Colonial Period to the Present''. New York:Rizzoli. {{ISBN|0847800490}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, whereas the Pop artists were primarily pointing out the absurdity of much of the imagery (especially in commercial usage), the Photorealists were trying to reclaim and exalt the value of an image.&lt;ref name="Chase, p. 14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prown 1977"/&gt;

The association of Photorealism to ''[[Trompe L'oeil]]'' is a wrongly attributed comparison, an error in observation or interpretation made by many critics of the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="Superrealist 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fleming709&gt;Fleming, John and Honour, Hugh (1991), ''The Visual Arts: A History,'' 3rd Edition. New York: [[Harry N. Abrams|Abrams]]. p. 709. {{ISBN|0810939134}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Trompe L'oeil paintings attempt to "fool the eye" and make the viewer think he is seeing an actual object, not a painted one. When observing a Photorealist painting, the viewer is always aware that they are looking at a painting.&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Superrealist 1"/&gt;

===Definition===
The word ''Photorealism'' was coined by [[Louis K. Meisel]]&lt;ref name="meiselgallery1"&gt;[http://www.meiselgallery.com/ Meiselgallery.com]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1969 and appeared in print for the first time in 1970 in a Whitney Museum catalogue for the show "Twenty-two Realists."&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 12"&gt;Meisel (1989), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also sometimes labeled as Super-Realism, [[New Realism]], Sharp Focus Realism, or [[hyperrealism (painting)|Hyper-Realism]].&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 12" /&gt;

Louis K. Meisel,&lt;ref name="meiselgallery1"/&gt; two years later, developed a five-point definition at the request of Stuart M. Speiser, who had commissioned a large collection of works by the Photorealists, which later developed into a traveling show known as 'Photo-Realism 1973: The Stuart M. Speiser Collection', which was donated to the [[Smithsonian]] in 1978 and is shown in several of its museums as well as traveling under the auspices of 'site'.&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 12"/&gt;  The definition for the 'originators' was as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#  The Photo-Realist uses the camera and photograph to gather information.
#  The Photo-Realist uses a mechanical or semimechanical means to transfer the information to the canvas.
#  The Photo-Realist must have the technical ability to make the finished work appear photographic.
#  The artist must have exhibited work as a Photo-Realist by 1972 to be considered one of the central Photo-Realists.
#  The artist must have devoted at least five years to the development and exhibition of Photo-Realist work.&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 13"&gt;Meisel (1980), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Styles===
Photorealist painting cannot exist without the [[photograph]].  In Photorealism, change and movement must be frozen in time which must then be accurately represented by the artist.&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 13"/&gt;  Photorealists gather their imagery and information with the camera and photograph. Once the photograph is developed (usually onto a photographic slide) the artist will systematically transfer the image from the photographic slide onto [[canvas]]es.  Usually this is done either by projecting the slide onto the canvas or by using traditional grid techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel (1980), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting images are often direct copies of the original photograph but are usually larger than the original photograph or slide.  This results in the photorealist style being tight and precise, often with an emphasis on imagery that requires a high level of technical prowess and [[virtuoso|virtuosity]] to simulate, such as [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]]s in specular surfaces and the [[geometry|geometric]] rigor of man-made environs.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel (1980), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artists===
The first generation of American photorealists includes such painters as [[John Baeder]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Charles Bell (painter)|Charles Bell]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Don Eddy]], [[Robert Bechtle]],  and [[Tom Blackwell]].&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980"&gt;Meisel (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;  Often working independently of each other and with widely different starting points, these original photorealists routinely tackled mundane or familiar subjects in traditional art genres--[[landscape]]s (mostly [[cityscape|urban]] rather than naturalistic), [[portrait]]s, and [[still life]]s.&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980"/&gt; In the UK, photorealist approaches were favoured by many artists including Mike Gorman and Eric Scott. The introduction of these European painters to a wider US audience was brought about through the 1982 'Superhumanism' exhibition at the Arnold Katzen Gallery, New York.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Nora. (October 15, 2015) [http://onmywall.co/photorealism-technical-mastery-and-effortless-style/ "Photorealism - Technical Mastery and Effortless Style"] ''On My Wall''&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the movement is primarily associated with painting, [[Duane Hanson]] and [[John DeAndrea]] are [[sculptor]]s associated with photorealism for their painted, lifelike sculptures of average people that were complete with simulated [[hair]] and real clothes. They are called ''Verists.''&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980" /&gt;

===Since 2000===

[[File:Glennray Tutor 1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Dream of Love'' (2005), Oil on canvas. Example of Photorealist [[Glennray Tutor]]'s work]]

Though the height of Photorealism was in the 1970s the movement continues and includes several of the original photorealists as well as many of their contemporaries.  According to Meisel and Chase's ''Photorealism at the Millennium'', only eight of the original photorealists were still creating photorealist work in 2002;&lt;ref&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; ten including [[John Baeder]] and Howard Kanovitz.

Artists Charles Bell, John Kacere, and Howard Kanovitz have died; Audrey Flack, Chuck Close, and Don Eddy have moved away from photorealism; and Robert Cottingham no longer considers himself a photorealist.

Newer Photorealists are building upon the foundations set by the original photorealists.  Examples would be the influence of Richard Estes in works by Anthony Brunelli or the influence of Ralph Goings and Charles Bell in works by [[Glennray Tutor]]. However, this has led many to move on from the strict definition of photorealism as the emulation of the photograph.  Photorealism is also no longer simply an American art movement. Starting with [[Franz Gertsch]] in the 1980s Clive Head, Raphaella Spence, Bertrand Meniel, and [[Roberto Bernardi]] are several European artists associated with photorealism that have emerged since the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meisel, Millennium"/&gt; This internationalization of photorealism is also seen in photorealist events, such as [[The Prague Project]], in which American and non-American photorealist painters have traveled together to locations including Prague, Zurich, Monaco and New York, to work alongside each other in producing work.

The evolution of technology has brought forth photorealistic paintings that exceed what was thought possible with paintings; these newer paintings by the photorealists are sometimes referred to as "[[Hyperrealism (painting)|Hyperrealism]]."&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  With new technology in cameras and digital equipment, artists are able to be far more precision-oriented and can produce imagery using a wider range of media.  The artist [[William Fink|Bill Fink]] has developed his own technique for creating photorealistic images using soil, pollen, human hair, and cremated human remains.&lt;ref name=advocate&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Photo Realism: Artist Bill Fink uses human ash to create a visual AIDS memorial|author=Steve Greenberg|date=2 June 1992|magazine=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|issue=604|pages=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photorealism's influence and popularity continues to grow, with new books such as [[Juxtapoz]]'s 2014 book entitled ''Hyperreal'' detailing current trends within the artistic genre.

Topsoil as well as farm fertilizers and other potential pollutants run off unprotected farm fields when heavy rains occur.]]
A '''pollutant''' is a substance or energy introduced into the environment that has undesired effects, or adversely affects the usefulness of a resource. A pollutant may cause long- or short-term damage by changing the growth rate of plant or animal species, or by interfering with human amenities, comfort, health, or property values. Some pollutants are [[biodegradable]] and therefore will not persist in the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] in the long term. However, the degradation products of some pollutants are themselves polluting such as the products [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]] and [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane|DDD]] produced from degradation of [[Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane|DDT]].

==Different types of pollutants in nature==

===Stock pollutants===
Pollutants, towards which the environment has low [[absorptive capacity]] are called ''stock pollutants''.&lt;ref name=Tietenberg/&gt; (e.g. [[persistent organic pollutant]]s such as [[PCBs]], non-[[biodegradable]] [[Plastic pollution|plastics]], and [[heavy metals]]). Stock pollutants accumulate in the environment over time. The damage they cause increases as more pollutant is emitted, and persists as the pollutant accumulates. Stock pollutants can create a burden for future generations, by passing on damage that persists well after the ‘benefits' received from incurring that damage; have been forgotten.&lt;ref name=Tietenberg&gt;[[Tietenberg, Tom]] (2006). Economics of Pollution Control, Chapter 15 in ''Environmental and Natural Resource Economics'', 7th Edition, Pearson, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fund pollutants===
Fund pollutants are those for which the environment has moderate absorptive capacity. Fund pollutants do not cause damage to the environment unless the emission rate exceeds the receiving environment's absorptive capacity (e.g. carbon dioxide, which is absorbed by plants and oceans).&lt;ref name=Tietenberg/&gt; Fund pollutants are not destroyed, but rather converted into less harmful substances, or diluted/dispersed to non-harmful concentrations.&lt;ref name=Tietenberg/&gt;

=== Notable pollutants ===
Notable pollutants include the following groups or compounds:

* [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] Hg
* [[Persistent organic pollutant]]s POPs
* [[Ozone]] Ozone
* [[Particulate matter]] [[Particulate pollution|PM]]
* [[Environmental Persistent Pharmaceutical Pollutant]]s EPPP
* [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s PAHs
* [[Volatile organic compound]]s VOCs

=== Light pollutant ===
[[Light pollution]] is the impact that anthropogenic light has on the visibility of the night sky. It also encompasses [[ecological light pollution]] which describes the effect of [[artificial light]] on individual [[organism]]s and on the structure of [[ecosystem]]s as a whole. 

[[File:Perseiid.jpg|thumb|The night sky viewed from Luhasoo bog, [[Estonia]] with light pollution in background.]]

==Zones of influence==
Pollutants can also be defined by their zones of influence, both horizontally and vertically.&lt;ref name=Tietenberg/&gt;

===Horizontal zone===
The horizontal zone refers to the area that is damaged by a pollutant. Local pollutants cause damage near the emission source. Regional pollutants cause damage further from the emission source.&lt;ref name=Tietenberg/&gt;

===Vertical zone===
The vertical zone refers to whether the damage is ground-level or atmospheric. Surface pollutants cause damage by accumulating near the Earth's surface. Global pollutants cause damage by concentrating in the [[atmosphere]].

==Regulation==
{{main|Regulation and monitoring of pollution}}

===International===
Pollutants can cross international borders and therefore international regulations are needed for their control. The [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]], which entered into force in 2004, is an international legally binding agreement for the control of persistent organic pollutants. [[Pollutant Release and Transfer Register]]s (PRTR) are systems to collect and disseminate information on environmental releases and transfers of toxic chemicals from industrial and other facilities.

===European Union===
The [[European Pollutant Emission Register]] is a type of PRTR providing access to information on the annual emissions of industrial facilities in the Member States of the [[European Union]], as well as Norway.

===United States===
'''Clean Air Act standards.''' Under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], the [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] (NAAQS) are developed by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) for six common air pollutants, also called "criteria pollutants": [[particulates]]; [[Smog#Photochemical_smog|smog]] and  [[ground-level ozone]]; [[carbon monoxide]]; [[sulfur oxide]]s; [[nitrogen oxide]]s; and [[lead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants/naaqs-table |title=NAAQS Table |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |website=Criteria Air Pollutants |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants]] are additional emission standards that are set by EPA for toxic air pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/stationary-sources-air-pollution/national-emission-standards-hazardous-air-pollutants-neshap-9 |title=National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants |date=2018-01-25 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16854">[[File:Banach-Tarski Paradox.svg|thumbnail|right|350px|An illustration of the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]], a famous result in pure mathematics. Although it is proven that it is possible to convert one sphere into two using nothing but cuts and rotations, the transformation involves objects that cannot exist in the physical world.]]
Broadly speaking, '''pure mathematics''' is [[mathematics]] that studies entirely abstract [[concept]]s.  This has been a recognizable category of mathematical activity from the 19th century onwards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Piaggio|first1=H|title=Three Sadleirian Professors: A.R. Forsyth, E.W. Hobson and G.H. Hardy|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Sadleirian_Professors.html|website=MacTutor History of Mathematics archive|publisher=St. Andrews University|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at variance with the trend towards meeting the needs of [[navigation]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[economics]], [[engineering]], and so on.

Another view is that pure mathematics is ''not necessarily'' [[applied mathematics]]: it is possible to study abstract entities with respect to their intrinsic nature and not be concerned with how they manifest in the real world.&lt;ref name=Magid/&gt; Even though the pure and applied viewpoints are distinct philosophical positions, in practice there is much overlap in the activity of pure and applied mathematicians.

To develop accurate models for describing the real world, many applied mathematicians draw on tools and techniques that are often considered to be "pure" mathematics. On the other hand, many pure mathematicians draw on natural and social phenomena as inspiration for their abstract research.

==History==

===Ancient Greece===
Ancient Greek mathematicians were among the earliest to make a distinction between pure and applied mathematics. [[Plato]] helped to create the gap between "arithmetic", now called [[number theory]], and "logistic", now called [[arithmetic]]. Plato regarded logistic (arithmetic) as appropriate for businessmen and men of war who "must learn the art of numbers or [they] will not know how to array [their] troops" and arithmetic (number theory) as appropriate for philosophers "because [they have] to arise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |edition=Second |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=1991 |isbn=0-471-54397-7|chapter=The age of Plato and Aristotle|pages=86|quote=Plato is important in the history of mathematics largely for his role as inspirer and director of others, and perhaps to him is due the sharp distinction in ancient Greece between arithmetic (in the sense of the theory of numbers) and logistic (the technique of computation). Plato regarded logistic as appropriate for the businessman and for the man of war, who "must learn the art of numbers or he will not know how to array his troops." The philosopher, on the other hand, must be an arithmetician "because he has to arise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being."}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euclid of Alexandria]], when asked by one of his students of what use was the study of geometry, asked his slave to give the student threepence, "since he must make gain of what he learns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |edition=Second |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=1991 |isbn=0-471-54397-7|chapter=Euclid of Alexandria |pages=101 |quote=Evidently Euclid did not stress the practical aspects of his subject, for there is a tale told of him that when one of his students asked of what use was the study of geometry, Euclid asked his slave to give the student threepence, "since he must make gain of what he learns."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek mathematician [[Apollonius of Perga]] was asked about the usefulness of some of his theorems in Book IV of ''Conics'' to which he proudly asserted,&lt;ref name="Apollonius"&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |edition=Second |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=1991 |isbn=0-471-54397-7|chapter=Apollonius of Perga|pages=152|quote=It is in connection with the theorems in this book that Apollonius makes a statement implying that in his day, as in ours, there were narrow-minded opponents of pure mathematics who pejoratively inquired about the usefulness of such results. The author proudly asserted: "They are worthy of acceptance for the sake of the demonstrations themselves, in the same way as we accept many other things in mathematics for this and for no other reason." (Heath 1961, p.lxxiv).&lt;BR&gt;The preface to Book V, relating to maximum and minimum straight lines drawn to a conic, again argues that the subject is one of those that seem "worthy of study for their own sake." While one must admire the author for his lofty intellectual attitude, it may be pertinently pointed out that s day was beautiful theory, with no prospect of applicability to the science or engineering of his time, has since become fundamental in such fields as terrestrial dynamics and celestial mechanics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;They are worthy of acceptance for the sake of the demonstrations themselves, in the same way as we accept many other things in mathematics for this and for no other reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And since many of his results were not applicable to the science or engineering of his day, Apollonius further argued in the preface of the fifth book of ''Conics'' that the subject is one of those that "...seem worthy of study for their own sake."&lt;ref name="Apollonius"/&gt;

===19th century===
The term itself is enshrined in the full title of the [[Sadleirian Professor of Pure Mathematics|Sadleirian Chair]], founded (as a professorship) in the mid-nineteenth century. The idea of a separate discipline of ''pure'' mathematics may have emerged at that time. The generation of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] made no sweeping distinction of the kind, between ''pure'' and ''applied''. In the following years, specialisation and professionalisation (particularly in the [[Weierstrass]] approach to [[mathematical analysis]]) started to make a rift more apparent.

===20th century===
At the start of the twentieth century mathematicians took up the [[axiomatic method]], strongly influenced by [[David Hilbert]]'s example. The logical formulation of '''pure mathematics''' suggested by [[Bertrand Russell]] in terms of a [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]] structure of [[Proposition (mathematics)|proposition]]s seemed more and more plausible, as large parts of mathematics became axiomatised and thus subject to the simple criteria of ''[[rigorous proof]]''.

In fact in an axiomatic setting ''rigorous'' adds nothing to the idea of ''proof''. Pure mathematics, according to a view that can be ascribed to the [[Bourbaki group]], is what is proved. '''Pure mathematician''' became a recognized vocation, achievable through training.

The case was made that pure mathematics is useful in [[engineering education]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[A. S. Hathaway]] (1901) [http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1901-07-06/S0002-9904-1901-00797-5/S0002-9904-1901-00797-5.pdf "Pure mathematics for engineering students"], [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] 7(6):266–71.&lt;/ref&gt;
:There is a training in habits of thought, points of view, and intellectual comprehension of ordinary engineering problems, which only the study of higher mathematics can give.

==Generality and abstraction==
One central concept in pure mathematics is the idea of generality; pure mathematics often exhibits a trend towards increased generality. Uses and advantages of generality include the following:

* Generalizing theorems or mathematical structures can lead to deeper understanding of the original theorems or structures
* Generality can simplify the presentation of material, resulting in shorter proofs or arguments that are easier to follow.
* One can use generality to avoid duplication of effort, proving a general result instead of having to prove separate cases independently, or using results from other areas of mathematics.
* Generality can facilitate connections between different branches of mathematics. [[Category theory]] is one area of mathematics dedicated to exploring this commonality of structure as it plays out in some areas of math.

Generality's impact on [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] is both dependent on the subject and a matter of personal preference or learning style.  Often generality is seen as a hindrance to intuition, although it can certainly function as an aid to it, especially when it provides analogies to material for which one already has good intuition.

As a prime example of generality, the [[Erlangen program]] involved an expansion of [[geometry]] to accommodate [[non-Euclidean geometries]] as well as the field of [[topology]], and other forms of geometry, by viewing geometry as the study of a space together with a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] of transformations.  The study of [[number]]s, called [[algebra]] at the beginning undergraduate level, extends to [[abstract algebra]] at a more advanced level; and the study of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, called [[calculus]] at the college freshman level becomes [[mathematical analysis]] and [[functional analysis]] at a more advanced level.  Each of these branches of more ''abstract'' mathematics have many sub-specialties, and there are in fact many connections between pure mathematics and applied mathematics disciplines. A steep rise in [[abstraction]] was seen mid 20th century.

In practice, however, these developments led to a sharp divergence from [[physics]], particularly from 1950 to 1983. Later this was criticised, for example by [[Vladimir Arnold]], as too much [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], not enough [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]]. The point does not yet seem to be settled, in that [[string theory]] pulls one way, while [[discrete mathematics]] pulls back towards proof as central.

==Purism==
Mathematicians have always had differing opinions regarding the distinction between pure and applied mathematics. 
One of the most famous (but perhaps misunderstood) modern examples of this debate can be found in [[G.H. Hardy]]'s ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]''.

It is widely believed that Hardy considered applied mathematics to be ugly and dull. Although it is true that Hardy preferred pure mathematics, which he often compared to [[painting]] and [[poetry]], Hardy saw the distinction between pure and applied mathematics to be simply that applied mathematics sought to express ''physical'' truth in a mathematical framework, whereas pure mathematics expressed truths that were independent of the physical world. Hardy made a separate distinction in mathematics between what he called "real" mathematics, "which has permanent aesthetic value", and "the dull and elementary parts of mathematics" that have practical use.

Hardy considered some physicists, such as [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], and [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]], to be among the "real" mathematicians, but at the time that he was writing the ''Apology'' he also considered [[general relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]] to be "useless", which allowed him to hold the opinion that only "dull" mathematics was useful. Moreover, Hardy briefly admitted that—just as the application of [[matrix theory]] and [[group theory]] to physics had come unexpectedly—the time may come where some kinds of beautiful, "real" mathematics may be useful as well.

Another insightful view is offered by Magid:
{{quote|I've always thought that a good model here could be drawn from ring theory. In that subject, one has the subareas of [[commutative ring|commutative ring theory]] and [[non-commutative ring|non-commutative ring theory]]. An uninformed observer might think that these represent a dichotomy, but in fact the latter subsumes the former: a non-commutative ring is a not-necessarily-commutative ring. If we use similar conventions, then we could refer to applied mathematics and nonapplied mathematics, where by the latter we ''mean not-necessarily-applied mathematics''... [emphasis added]&lt;ref name=Magid&gt;[[Andy Magid]] (November 2005) [http://www.ams.org/notices/200510/commentary.pdf Letter from the Editor], [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]], page 1173&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Subfields==
[[Mathematical analysis|Analysis]] is concerned with the properties of functions. It deals with concepts such as [[continuous function|continuity]], [[limit of a function|limits]], [[derivative|differentiation]] and [[integral|integration]], thus providing a rigorous foundation for the [[calculus]] of infinitesimals introduced by Newton and Leibniz in the 17th century. [[Real analysis]] studies functions of real numbers, while [[complex analysis]] extends the aforementioned concepts to functions of complex numbers.  [[Functional analysis]] is a branch of analysis that studies infinite-dimensional vector spaces and views functions as points in these spaces.

[[Abstract algebra]] is not to be confused with the manipulation of formulae that is covered in secondary education. It studies [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] together with [[binary operations]] defined on them. Sets and their binary operations may be classified according to their properties: for instance, if an operation is [[associative]] on a set that contains an identity element and inverses for each member of the set, the set and operation is considered to be a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. Other structures include [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], [[vector spaces]] and [[Lattice (group)|lattices]].

[[Geometry]] is the study of shapes and space, in particular, groups of transformations that act on spaces. For example, [[projective geometry]] is about the group of projective transformations that act on the real projective plane, whereas [[inversive geometry]] is concerned with the group of inversive transformations acting on the extended complex plane.

[[Number theory]] is the theory of the positive [[integers]]. It is based on ideas such as divisibility and [[modular arithmetic|congruence]]. Its [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic|fundamental theorem]] states that each positive integer has a unique prime factorization. In some ways it is the most accessible discipline in pure mathematics for the general public: for instance the [[Goldbach conjecture]] is easily stated (but is yet to be proved or disproved). In other ways it is the least accessible discipline; for example, Wiles' proof that Fermat's equation has no nontrivial solutions requires understanding [[automorphic forms]], which though intrinsic to nature have not found a place in physics or the general public discourse.

[[Topology]] is a modern extension of Geometry. Rather than focusing on the sizes of objects and their precise measurement, topology involves the properties of spaces or objects that are preserved under smooth operations such as bending or twisting (but not, for example, tearing or shearing). Topology's subfields interact with other branches of pure math: traditional topology uses ideas from [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]], such as metric spaces, and [[algebraic topology]] relies on ideas from [[combinatorics]] in addition to those of analysis.

[[Combinatorics]] is a branch of mathematics concerning the study of finite or countable discrete structures. It also interacts with many other areas of mathematics. For example, additive combinatorics is related to [[number theory]] and [[analysis]], and [[graph theory]] comes from [[topology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47096">A '''renewable resource''' is a [[natural resource]] which replenishes to overcome [[resource depletion]] caused by usage and consumption, either through biological reproduction or other naturally recurring processes in a finite amount of time in a human time scale. Renewable resources are a part of Earth's natural environment and the largest components of its [[Ecosphere (ecology)|ecosphere]]. A positive life cycle assessment is a key indicator of a resource's sustainability.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Management for a Small Planet" by Jean Garner Stead and W. Edward Stead, M.E.

==Air, food and water==

===Water resources===

{{Main article|Water resources}}

[[Water]] can be considered a ''renewable'' material when carefully controlled usage, treatment, and release are followed. If not, it would become a non-renewable resource at that location. For example, [[groundwater]] is usually removed from an [[aquifer]] at a rate much greater than its very slow natural recharge, and so groundwater is considered non-renewable. Removal of water from the pore spaces may cause permanent compaction ([[subsidence]]) that cannot be renewed. 97.5% of the water on the Earth is salt water, and 3% is [[fresh water]]; slightly over two thirds of this is frozen in [[glacier]]s and [[Polar climate|polar]] [[ice cap]]s.&lt;ref name="USGS dist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/waterdistribution.html|title=Earth's water distribution|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining unfrozen freshwater is found mainly as groundwater, with only a small fraction (0.008%) present above ground or in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Scientific Facts on Water: State of the Resource| publisher=GreenFacts Website | accessdate=2008-01-31 | url= http://www.greenfacts.org/en/water-resources/index.htm#2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Water pollution]] is one of the main concerns regarding water resources. It is estimated that 22% of worldwide water is used in industry.&lt;ref name="WBCSD Water Facts &amp; Trends"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&amp;id=MTYyNTA |title=WBCSD Water Facts &amp; Trends |date= |accessdate=2009-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301011840/http://www.wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&amp;id=MTYyNTA |archivedate=2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Major industrial users include hydroelectric dams, [[Electricity generation#Other generation methods|thermoelectric power plants]] (which use water for cooling), [[ore]] and [[Petroleum|oil]] refineries (which use water in chemical processes) and manufacturing plants (which use water as a solvent).

[[Desalination]] of seawater is considered a renewable source of water, although reducing its dependence on fossil fuel energy is needed for it to be fully renewable.&lt;ref name=LowCDesal&gt;{{cite web | last=Lienhard | first=John H. | last2=Thiel | first2=Gregory P. | last3=Warsinger | first3=David M. | last4=Banchik | first4=Leonardo D. | title=Low Carbon Desalination: Status and Research, Development, and Demonstration Needs, Report of a workshop conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in association with the Global Clean Water Desalination Alliance | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology | date=2016-12-08 | url=http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/105755 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212568/food Encyclopædia Britannica definition]&lt;/ref&gt; Most food has its origin in renewable resources. Food is obtained directly from plants and animals.

Hunting may not be the first source of meat in the modernised world, but it is still an important and essential source for many rural and remote groups. It is also the sole source of feeding for wild carnivores.&lt;ref&gt;Mammals: Carnivores. Duane E. Ullrey. Encyclopedia of Animal Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable agriculture===
{{main article|Sustainable agriculture}}
The phrase [[sustainable agriculture]] was coined by Australian agricultural scientist [[Gordon McClymont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rural Science Graduates Association |year=2002 |url=http://agbu.une.edu.au/~aaabg/rsga/im.html |title={{sic|In Memo|rium|hide=y|expected=In Memoriam}}&amp;nbsp;— Former Staff and Students of Rural Science at UNE |publisher=[[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]] |accessdate=21 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606220152/http://agbu.une.edu.au/~aaabg/rsga/im.html |archivedate=6 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been defined as "an integrated system of plant and animal production practices having a site-specific application that will last over the long term".&lt;ref&gt;Gold, M. (July 2009). [http://www.nal.usda.gov/afsic/pubs/agnic/susag.shtml What is Sustainable Agriculture?]. United States Department of Agriculture, Alternative Farming Systems Information Center.&lt;/ref&gt; Expansion of agricultural land reduces [[biodiversity]] and contributes to [[deforestation]]. The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations estimates that in coming decades, cropland will continue to be lost to industrial and urban development, along with reclamation of wetlands, and conversion of forest to cultivation, resulting in the [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] and increased [[soil erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y4252e/y4252e14.htm |title=FAO World Agriculture towards 2015/2030 |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |year=2003 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Polyculture.JPG|thumb|250px|Polyculture practices in [[Andhra Pradesh]]]]
Although [[air]] and [[sunlight]] are available everywhere on [[Earth]], [[Agriculture|crops]] also depend on [[soil]] [[nutrients]] and the availability of [[water resources|water]]. [[Monoculture]] is a method of growing only one crop at a time in a given field, which can damage land and cause it to become either unusable or suffer from reduced [[Crop yield|yields]]. Monoculture can also cause the build-up of [[pathogen]]s and pests that target one specific species. The [[Great Irish Famine|Great Irish Famine (1845–1849)]] is a well-known example of the dangers of monoculture.

[[Crop rotation]] and [[shifting cultivation|long-term crop rotations]] confer the replenishment of nitrogen through the use of [[green manure]] in sequence with cereals and other crops, and can improve [[soil structure]] and [[fertility (soil)|fertility]] by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants. Other methods to combat lost soil nutrients are returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands (returning lost nutrients indefinitely) such as the [[Flooding of the Nile]], the long-term use of [[biochar]], and use of crop and livestock [[landrace]]s that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests, drought, or lack of nutrients.

Agricultural practices are the single greatest contributor to the global increase in [[Erosion|soil erosion]] rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|authors=Committee on 21st Century Systems Agriculture|title=Toward Sustainable Agricultural Systems in the 21st Century|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-309-14896-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wdm4qMW1azgC&amp;pg=PT88}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that "more than a thousand million tonnes of southern Africa's soil are eroded every year. Experts predict that crop yields will be halved within thirty to fifty years if erosion continues at present rates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Musokotwane Environment Resource Centre for Southern Africa CEP Factsheet |url=http://www.sardc.net/imercsa/Programs/CEP/Pubs/CEPFS/CEPFS01.htm |accessdate=2013-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213002938/http://www.sardc.net/imercsa/Programs/CEP/Pubs/CEPFS/CEPFS01.htm |archivedate=2013-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dust Bowl]] phenomenon in the 1930s was caused by severe [[drought]] combined with farming methods that did not include crop rotation, fallow fields, [[cover crop]]s, soil terracing and wind-breaking trees to prevent [[Aeolian processes|wind erosion]].&lt;ref name=drought&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tillage]] of agricultural lands is one of the primary contributing factors to erosion, due to mechanised agricultural equipment that allows for deep plowing, which severely increases the amount of soil that is available for transport by [[water erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Blanco, Humberto &amp; Lal, Rattan|chapter=Tillage erosion|title=Principles of Soil Conservation and Management|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=978-90-481-8529-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wj3690PbDY0C&amp;pg=PA109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lobb, D.A.|chapter=Soil movement by tillage and other agricultural activities|editor=Jorgenson, Sven E.|title=Applications in Ecological Engineering|publisher=Academic Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-444-53448-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aRKO6ZazC8UC&amp;pg=PA247}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The phenomenon called ''peak soil'' describes how large-scale factory farming techniques are affecting humanity's ability to grow food in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Peak Soil: Why cellulosic ethanol, biofuels are unsustainable and a threat to America |url=http://culturechange.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=107&amp;Itemid=1 |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without efforts to improve soil management practices, the availability of [[Arable land|arable soil]] may become increasingly problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CopperWiki Soil erosion |url=http://www.copperwiki.org/index.php?title=Soil_erosion |accessdate=2013-01-05}}{{unreliable source?|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods to combat erosion include [[no-till farming]], using a [[keyline design]], growing [[Hedge|wind breaks]] to hold the soil, and widespread use of [[compost]]. [[Fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s can also have an effect of soil erosion,{{cn|date=July 2018}} which can contribute to [[soil salinity]] and prevent other species from growing. [[Phosphate]] is a primary component in the chemical fertiliser applied most commonly in modern agricultural production. However, scientists estimate that rock phosphate reserves will be depleted in 50–100 years and that ''Peak Phosphate'' will occur in about 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095937800800099X |title=The story of phosphorus: Global food security and food for thought |author=Cordell|journal= Global Environmental Change |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2013-01-06|display-authors=etal |doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2008.10.009 |volume=19 |pages=292–305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Industrial process]]ing and [[logistics]] also have an effect on agriculture's sustainability. The way and locations crops are [[selling|sold]] requires energy for transportation, as well as the energy cost for materials, [[labour (economics)|labour]], and [[transport]]. Food sold at a local location, such a [[farmers' market]], have reduced energy overheads.

===Air===
Air is a renewable resource. All [[living organisms]] need [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]] (directly or indirectly), [[carbon]] (directly or indirectly) and many other gases in small [[quantities]] for their [[survival skills|survival]].

==Non-food resources==
[[File:Douglas des farges 1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Douglas fir]] forest created in 1850, [[Meymac]] (Corrèze), France]]

An important renewable resource is [[wood]] provided by means of [[forestry]], which has been used for construction, housing and firewood since ancient times.

A large variety of [[Grease (lubricant)|lubricants]], industrially used vegetable oils, textiles and fibre made e.g. of [[cotton]], [[copra]] or [[hemp]], [[paper]] derived from [[wood]], [[Textile|rags]] or [[grass]]es, [[bioplastic]] are based on plant renewable resources. A large variety of chemical based products like [[latex]], [[ethanol]], [[resin]], [[sugar]] and [[starch]] can be provided with plant renewables. Animal based renewables include [[fur]], [[leather]], technical [[fat]] and lubricants and further derived products, as e.g. [[animal glue]], [[tendon]]s, [[Casing (sausage)|casings]] or in historical times [[ambergris|ambra]] and [[baleen]] provided by [[whaling]].

With regard to pharmacy ingredients and legal and illegal drugs, plants are important sources, however e.g. venom of snakes, frogs and insects has been a valuable renewable source of pharmacological ingredients. Before GMO production set in, [[insulin]] and important [[hormones]] were based on animal sources. [[Feather]]s, an important byproduct of poultry farming for food, is still being used as filler and as base for [[keratin]] in general. Same applies for the [[chitin]] produced in farming [[Crustacean]]s which may be used as base of [[chitosan]]. The most important part of the human body used for non-medical purposes is [[human hair]] as for [[artificial hair integrations]], which is being traded worldwide.

===Historical role===
[[File:Japan Factory Ship Nisshin Maru Whaling Mother and Calf.jpg|left|thumb|An adult and sub-adult [[Minke whale]] are dragged aboard the [[Nisshin Maru]], a Japanese whaling vessel]]
[[File:Hanfdaemmstoff CG.jpg|right|thumb|[[Hemp#Building material|Hemp]] insulation, a renewable resource used as [[Sustainable living#Sustainable building materials|building material]]]]

Historically, renewable resources like firewood, [[latex]],  [[guano]], [[charcoal]], [[wood ash]], plant colors as [[indigo]], and whale products have been crucial for human needs but failed to supply demand in the beginning of the industrial era.&lt;ref name=rad/&gt; Early modern times faced large problems with overuse of renewable resources as in [[deforestation]], [[overgrazing]] or [[overfishing]].&lt;ref name=rad/&gt;

In addition to fresh meat and milk, which as food items are not the topic of this section, [[livestock]] farmers and artisans used further animal ingredients as  [[tendon]]s, horn, bones, bladders. Complex technical constructions as the [[composite bow]] were based on combination of animal and plant based materials. The current distribution conflict between biofuel and food production is being described as [[Food vs. fuel]]. Conflicts between food needs and usage, as supposed by [[fief]] obligations were in so far common in historical times as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wageningenacademic.com/_clientfiles/download/livestockhousing-e_01.pdf A short history of livestock production]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, J.

The [[British Agricultural Revolution]] was mainly based on a new system of [[crop rotation]], the  four-field rotation. [[United Kingdom|British]] agriculturist [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Charles Townshend]] recognised the invention in Dutch [[Waasland]] and popularised it in the 18th century UK, [[George Washington Carver]] in the USA. The system used [[wheat]], [[turnip]]s and [[barley]] and introduced as well [[clover]]. Clover is able to fix nitrogen from air, a practically non exhaustive renewable resource, into fertilizing compounds to the soil and allowed to increase yields by large. Farmers opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop. Thus [[livestock]] could to be bred year-round and winter [[culling]] was avoided. The amount of manure rose and allowed more crops but to refrain from [[wood pasture]].&lt;ref name=rad/&gt;

Early modern times and the 19th century saw the previous resource base partially replaced respectively supplemented by large scale chemical synthesis and by the use of fossil and mineral resources respectively.&lt;ref name= DCH/&gt; Besides the still central role of wood, there is a sort of renaissance of renewable products based on modern agriculture, genetic research and extraction technology. Besides fears about an upcoming [[peak oil|global shortage of fossil fuels]], local shortages due to boycotts, war and blockades or just transportation problems in remote regions have contributed to different methods of replacing or substituting fossil resources based on renewables.

===Challenges===
The use of certain basically renewable products as in [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Animal substances|TCM]] [[endangered species|endangers various species]]. Just the black market in [[rhinoceros horn]] reduced the world's rhino population by more than 90 percent over the past 40 years.&lt;ref name=RH&gt;''"Rhino horn: All myth, no medicine"'', ''National Geographic'', Rhishja Larson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FTCMRH&gt;''Facts about traditional Chinese medicine (TCM): rhinoceros horn'', Encyclopædia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/facts/5/1035448/traditional-Chinese-medicine-TCM-as-discussed-in-rhinoceros-mammal Facts about traditional Chinese medicine (TCM): rhinoceros horn, as discussed in rhinoceros (mammal):&amp;nbsp;– Britannica Online Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renewables used for self sufficiency===
[[Image:FA Geisenheim22.jpg|thumb|In vitro-culture of Vitis (grapevine), [[Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute]]]]
The success of the German chemical industry till World War I was based on the replacement of colonial products. The predecessors of [[IG Farben]]  dominated the world market for [[Dye|synthetic dyes]] at the beginning of the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aftalion|1991|p=104}}, {{Harvnb|Chandler|2004|p=475}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had an important role in artificial [[Drug|pharmaceuticals]], [[photographic film]], [[Agrichemical|agricultural chemicals]] and [[Electrochemistry|electrochemicals]].&lt;ref name= DCH&gt;{{Cite book|title = The German Chemical Industry in the Twentieth Century|last = Lesch|first = John E.|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year = 2000|isbn = |location = |pages = 219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the former [[Plant breeding]] research institutes took a different approach. After the loss of the [[German colonial empire]], important players in the field as [[Erwin Baur]] and [[Konrad Meyer]] switched to using local crops as base for economic [[autarky]].&lt;ref name="heim"&gt;Autarkie und Ostexpansion: Pflanzenzucht und Agrarforschung im Nationalsozialismus, (agrarian research during the NS regime) Susanne Heim, Wallstein, 2002, {{ISBN|389244496X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Autarkie und Ostexpansion: Pflanzenzucht und Agrarforschung im Nationalsozialismus, (agrarian research during the NS regime)|last = Heim|first = Susanne|publisher = Wallstein|year = 2002|isbn = 389244496X|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer as a key agricultural scientist and spatial planner of the Nazi era managed and lead [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] resources and focused about a third of the complete research grants in Nazi Germany on agricultural and genetic research and especially on resources needed in case of a further German war effort.&lt;ref name="heim"/&gt;  A wide array of agrarian research institutes still existing today and having importance in the field was founded or enlarged in the time.

There were some major failures as trying to e.g. grow [[Hardiness (plants)|frost resistant]] olive species, but some success in the case of [[hemp]], [[flax]], [[rapeseed]], which are still of current importance.&lt;ref name="heim"/&gt; During World War 2, German scientists tried to use Russian [[Taraxacum]] (dandelion) species to manufacture [[natural rubber]].&lt;ref name="heim"/&gt;  Rubber dandelions are still of interest, as scientists in the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (IME) announced 2013 to have developed a cultivar that is suitable for commercial production of natural rubber.&lt;ref name=sciencedaily&gt;{{cite web|title=Making Rubber from Dandelion Juice|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/10/131028114547.htm|work=sciencedaily.com|publisher=sciencedaily.com|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal situation and subsidies==
Several legal and economic means have been used to enhance the market share of renewables.
The UK uses [[Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation]]s (NFFO), a collection of [[Statutory Instrument|orders]] requiring the electricity [[Distribution Network Operator]]s in [[England]] and [[Wales]] to purchase electricity from the [[nuclear power]] and [[renewable energy]] sectors. Similar mechanisms operate in [[Scotland]] (the Scottish Renewable Orders under the Scottish Renewables Obligation) and [[Northern Ireland]] (the Northern Ireland Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation). In the USA, [[Renewable Energy Certificates]] (RECs), use a similar approach. German [[Energy transition|Energiewende]] is using fed-in tariffs. An unexpected outcome of the subsidies was the quick increase of pellet byfiring in conventional fossil fuel plants (compare [[Tilbury power stations]]) and cement works, making wood respectively biomass accounting for about half of Europe’s renewable-energy consumption.&lt;ref Name=woodecon/&gt;

The tremendous diversity of enzymes in biological organisms, and the potential for [[synthetic biology]] to alter these enzymes to create yet new chemical functionalities, can drive the chemical industry.  A major platform for creation of new chemicals is the [[polyketide]] biosynthetic pathway, which generates chemicals containing repeated [[alkyl]] chain units with potential for a wide variety of [[functional group]]s at the different carbon atoms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garg|first=Shivani|last2=Rizhsky|first2=Ludmila|last3=Jin|first3=Huanan|last4=Yu|first4=Xiaochen|last5=Jing|first5=Fuyuan|last6=Yandeau-Nelson|first6=Marna D.|last7=Nikolau|first7=Basil J.|title=Microbial production of bi-functional molecules by diversification of the fatty acid pathway|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1096717616000045|journal=Metabolic Engineering|volume=35|pages=9–20|doi=10.1016/j.ymben.2016.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leber|first=Christopher|last2=Da Silva|first2=Nancy A.|date=2014-02-01|title=Engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the synthesis of short chain fatty acids|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.25021/abstract|journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering|language=en|volume=111|issue=2|pages=347–358|doi=10.1002/bit.25021|issn=1097-0290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deforestation===

{{main article|Deforestation}}
[[File:Deforestation Carceres Braasil 1996.jpg|thumb|[[Deforestation in Brazil]] 1996]]
Besides their role as a resource for fuel and building material, trees protect the environment by absorbing carbon dioxide and by creating oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chemistry.about.com/od/environmentalchemistry/f/oxygen-produced-by-trees.htm How Much Oxygen Does One Tree Produce?] By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D., About.com Guide&lt;/ref&gt;  The destruction of rain forests is one of the critical causes of [[climate change]]. Deforestation causes carbon dioxide to linger in the atmosphere. As carbon dioxide accrues, it produces a layer in the atmosphere that traps radiation from the sun. The radiation converts to heat which causes [[global warming]], which is better known as the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;Mumoki, Fiona. “The Effects of Deforestation on our Environment Today.” Panorama. TakingITGlobal. 18 July 2006. Web. 24 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deforestation also affects the [[water cycle]]. It reduces the content of water in the soil and groundwater as well as atmospheric moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html |title=Underlying Causes of Deforestation |work=UN Secretary-General’s Report |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411092448/http://wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html |archivedate=2001-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deforestation reduces soil cohesion, so that [[Soil erosion|erosion]], flooding and [[landslide]]s ensue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwec.edu/jolhm/EH2/Rogge/index.htm|author=Daniel Rogge|work=University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire|title=Deforestation and Landslides in Southwestern Washington|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805191140/http://www.uwec.edu/jolhm/EH2/Rogge/index.htm|archivedate=2012-08-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/413717.stm |title=China's floods: Is deforestation to blame? |publisher=BBC News |date=August 6, 1999 |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rain forests house many species and organisms providing people with food and other commodities.

Some renewable resources, species and organisms are facing a very high risk of extinction caused by growing human population and over-consumption. It has been estimated that over 40% of all living species on Earth are at risk of going extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservationandwildlife.com/threatened-species/|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20170525032656/http://www.conservationandwildlife.com/threatened-species/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 May 2017|title=Threatened Species|publisher=Conservation and Wildlife|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many nations have laws to protect hunted species and to restrict the practice of hunting. Other conservation methods include restricting land development or creating preserves. The [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] is the best-known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/red-list-overview |title=Red List Overview |date=February 2011 |publisher=IUCN |accessdate=2 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527175928/http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/red-list-overview |archivedate=27 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, 199 countries have signed an accord agreeing to create [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s to protect endangered and other threatened species.

In 1956, [[Anthony F. C. Wallace]] published a paper called '''"Revitalization Movements"''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sjsu.edu/people/mira.amiras/courses/c10/s2/AFC_Wallace_RevitalizationMvt.pdf   Wallace, Anthony F.C. 1956. "Revitalization Movements," ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' 58: 264-281.]&lt;/ref&gt; to describe how [[culture]]s change themselves.   A revitalization movement is a "deliberate, organized, conscious effort by members of a society to construct a more satisfying culture" (p.&amp;nbsp;265), and Wallace describes at length the processes by which a revitalization movement takes place.

Wallace' model 1956 describes the process of a '''revitalization movement'''. It is derived from studies of a Native American religious movement, The Code of [[Handsome Lake]], which may have led to the formation of the [[Longhouse Religion]]. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{Plainlist|
*I. ''Period of generally satisfactory adaptation'' to a group's social and natural environment.
*II. ''Period of increased individual stress''. While the group as a whole is able to survive through its accustomed  cultural behavior, changes in the social or natural environment frustrate efforts of many people to obtain normal satisfactions of their needs.
*III. ''Period of cultural distortion''. Changes in the group's social or natural environment drastically reduce the capacity of accustomed cultural behavior to satisfy most persons' physical and emotional needs.
*IV. ''Period of revitalization'': (1) reformulation of the cultural pattern; (2) its communication; (3) organization of a reformulated cultural pattern; (4) adaptation of the reformulated pattern to better meet the needs and preferences of the group; (5) cultural transformation; (6) routinization, when the adapted reformulated cultural pattern becomes the standard cultural behavior for the group.
*V. ''New period of generally satisfactory adaptation'' to the group's changed social and/or natural environment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}
}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wallace derived his theory from studies of so-called primitive peoples (preliterate and homogeneous), with particular attention to the [[Iroquois]] revitalization movement led by [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] religious leader and [[prophet]] [[Handsome Lake]] (1735-1815). Wallace believed that his revitalization model applies to movements as broad and complex as the rise of [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], or [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan Methodism]].

Revitalizaton is a part of social movements.

Scholars such as Vittorio Lanternari (1963) and Peter Worsley (1968) have developed and adapted Wallace's insights.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16046">[[File:Perotin - Alleluia nativitas.jpg|thumb|Pérotin, "Alleluia nativitas", in the third rhythmic mode.]]
In [[medieval music]], the '''rhythmic modes''' were set patterns of long and short [[duration (music)|duration]]s (or [[rhythm]]s). The value of each [[musical notation|note]] is not determined by the form of the written note (as is the case with more recent European musical notation), but rather by its position within a group of notes written as a single figure called a [[Ligature (music)|"ligature"]], and by the position of the ligature relative to other ligatures. '''Modal notation''' was developed by the composers of the [[Notre Dame school]] from 1170 to 1250, replacing the even and unmeasured rhythm of early [[polyphony]] and [[plainchant]] with patterns based on the metric feet of classical poetry, and was the first step towards the development of modern [[mensural notation]] {{harv|Hoppin|1978|loc=221}}. The rhythmic modes of Notre Dame Polyphony were the first coherent system of rhythmic notation developed in Western music since antiquity.

==History==
Though the use of the rhythmic modes is the most characteristic feature of the music of the late [[Notre Dame school]], especially the compositions of [[Pérotin]], they are also predominant in much of the rest of the music of the ''[[ars antiqua]]'' until about the middle of the 13th century. Composition types which were permeated by the modal rhythm include Notre Dame [[organum]] (most famously, the organum triplum and organum quadruplum of Pérotin), [[conductus]], and [[Clausula (music)|discant clausulae]]. Later in the century, the motets by [[Petrus de Cruce]] and the many anonymous composers, which were descended from discant clausulae, also used modal rhythm, often with much greater complexity than was found earlier in the century: for example each voice sometimes sang in a different mode, as well as a different language.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

In most sources there were six rhythmic modes, as first explained in the anonymous treatise of about 1260, ''De mensurabili musica'' (formerly attributed to [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]], who is now believed merely to have edited it in the late 13th century for [[Jerome of Moravia]], who incorporated it into his own compilation) {{harv|Baltzer|2001}}. Each mode consisted of a short pattern of long and short note values ("[[Longa (music)|longa]]" and "[[Double whole note|brevis]]") corresponding to a [[metrical foot]], as follows {{harv|Reese|1940|loc=207–209}}:

# Long-short ([[trochee]])
# Short-long ([[Iamb (foot)|iamb]])
# Long-short-short ([[dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]])
# Short-short-long ([[anapaest]])
# Long-long ([[spondee]])
# Short-short-short ([[Tribrach (poetry)|tribrach]])

Although this system of six modes was recognized by medieval theorists, in practice only the first three and fifth patterns were commonly used, with the first mode being by far the most frequent {{harv|Apel|1961|loc=223}}. The fourth mode is rarely encountered, an exception being the second clausula of ''Lux magna'' in MS Wolfenbüttel 677, fol. 44 {{harv|Hughes|1956a|loc=320}}. The fifth mode normally occurs in groups of three and is used only in the lowest voice (or tenor), whereas the sixth mode is most often found in an upper part {{harv|Hughes|1954a|loc=320}}.

Modern transcriptions of the six modes usually are as follows:

# Quarter ([[crotchet]]), eighth ([[quaver]]) (generally [[meter (music)|barred]], therefore, in 3/8 or, because the patterns usually repeat an even number of times, in 6/8 (Apel 1961, 221))&lt;br&gt;[[File:Rhythmic mode 1.PNG]] {{audio|Rhythmic mode 1.mid|Play X4}}
# Eighth, quarter (barred in 3/8 or 6/8)&lt;br&gt;[[File:Rhythmic mode 2.PNG]] {{audio|Rhythmic mode 2.mid|Play X4}}
# Dotted quarter, eighth, quarter (barred in 6/8)&lt;br&gt;[[File:Rhythmic mode 3.PNG]] {{audio|Rhythmic mode 3.mid|Play X2}}
# Eighth, quarter, dotted quarter (barred in 6/8)&lt;br&gt;[[File:Rhythmic mode 4.PNG]] {{audio|Rhythmic mode 4.mid|Play X2}}
# Dotted quarters (barred in either 3/8 or 6/8)&lt;br&gt;[[File:Rhythmic mode 5.PNG]] {{audio|Rhythmic mode 5.mid|Play X2}}
# Eighths (barred in 3/8 or 6/8)&lt;br&gt;[[File:Rhythmic mode 6.PNG]] {{audio|Rhythmic mode 6.mid|Play X4}}
*Cooper (1973, 30) gives the above but doubled in length, thus 1) is {{music|half}} {{music|quarter}} barred in 3/4, for example.
*Riemann (1962, 135) is another modern exception, who also gives the values twice as long, in 3/4 time, but in addition holds that the third and fourth modes were really intended to represent the modern {{music|common-time}}, with duple rhythms ( {{music|half}} {{music|quarter}} {{music|quarter}} and {{music|quarter}} {{music|quarter}} {{music|half}}, respectively).

==Notation==
[[File:Pérotin - Viderunt omnes.jpg|thumb|Pérotin, ''Viderunt omnes'' (Gradual for Christmas Day), in the first rhythmic mode. MS Florence, Biblioteca Medicea-Laurenziana, Pluteo 29.1, fol. 1 recto.]]
Devised in the last half of the 12th century {{harv|Seay|1975|loc=97}}, the notation of rhythmic modes used stereotyped combinations of ligatures (joined noteheads) to indicate the patterns of long notes (longs) and short notes (breves), enabling a performer to recognize which of the six rhythmic modes was intended for a given passage.
Linked notes in groups of:
3, 2, 2, 2, etc. indicate the first mode,
2, 2, 2, 2, … 3 the second mode, 
1, 3, 3, 3, 3, etc. the third mode,
3, 3, 3, … 1 the fourth mode,
3, 3, 3, 3, etc. the fifth mode, 
and 4, 3, 3, 3, etc. the sixth mode
{{harv|Hughes 1954a|loc=323–24}}.
The reading and performance of the music notated using the rhythmic modes was thus based on context. After recognizing which of the six modes applied to a passage of [[neume]]s, a singer would generally continue on in that same mode until the end of a phrase, or a [[cadence (music)|cadence]]. In modern editions of medieval music, ligatures are represented by horizontal brackets over the notes contained within it.

All the modes adhere to a ternary principle of metre, meaning that each mode would have a number of beat subdivisions divisible by the number 3. Some medieval writers explained this as veneration for the perfection of the Holy Trinity, but it appears that this was an explanation made after the event, rather than a cause ({{harvnb|Reese|1940|loc=274}}; {{harvnb|Hughes|1954a|loc=319–20}}). Less speculatively, the flexibility of rhythm possible within the system allows for variety and avoids monotony. Notes could be broken down into shorter units (called ''fractio modi'' by [[Anonymous IV]]) or two rhythmic units of the same mode could be combined into one (''extensio modi'') {{harv|Seay|1975|loc=98–99}}. An alternative term used by Garlandia for both types of alteration was "reduction" {{harv|Roesner|2001}}. These alterations may be accomplished in several ways: ''extensio modi'' by the insertion of single (unligated) long notes or a smaller-than-usual ligature; ''fractio modi'' by the insertion of a larger-than-usual ligature, or by special signs. These were of two types, the ''plica'' and the ''climacus'' {{harv|Hiley and Payne|2001}}.

The ''plica'' was adopted from the liquescent neumes (''cephalicus'') of chant notation, and receives its name (Latin for "fold") from its form which, when written as a separate note, had the shape of a U or an inverted U. In modal notation, however, the plica usually occurs as a vertical stroke added to the end of a ligature, making it a ''ligatura plicata''. The plica usually indicates an added breve on a weak beat {{harv|Hiley and Payne|2001}}. The pitch indicated by the plica depends on the pitches of the note it is attached to and the note following it. If both notes are the same, then the plica tone is the upper or lower neighbor, depending on the direction of the stem. If the interval between the main notes is a third, then the plica tone fills it in as a passing tone. If the two main notes are a second apart, or at an interval of a fourth or larger, musical context must decide the pitch of the plica tone {{harv|Apel|1961|loc=227}}.

[[File:Climacus.gif|thumb|The ''climacus''.]] [[File:Clivis cumpunctis carrée.jpg|thumb|''climacus'' with ligature]]
The ''climacus'' is a rapid descending scale figure, written as a single note or a ligature followed by a series of two or more descending lozenges. Anonymous IV called these ''currentes'' (Latin "running"), probably in reference to the similar figures found in pre-modal Aquitanian and Parisian polyphony. [[Franco of Cologne]] called them ''coniunctura'' (Latin for "joined [note]"). When consisting of just three notes (''coniunctura ternaria'') it is rhythmically identical with the ordinary three-note ligature, but when containing more notes this figure may be rhythmically ambiguous and therefore difficult to interpret {{harv|Hiley and Payne|2001}}. The difficulty was compounded in the later half of the 13th century, when the lozenge shape came also to be used for the [[semibreve]]. A general rule is that the last note is a longa, the second-last note is a breve, and all the preceding notes taken together occupy the space of a longa. However, the exact internal rhythm of these first notes of the group requires some interpretation according to context {{harv|Apel|1961|loc=240}}.

It was also possible to change from one mode to another without a break, which was called "admixture" by Anonymous IV, writing around 1280 {{harv|Roesner|2001}}.

[[File:Alteratio.png|thumbnail|Tenor from Motet "Homo, luge!"/"Homo miserabilis"/"Brumans e mors" (13th century). Third rhythmic mode, syllabic notation.]]
Because a ligature cannot be used for more than one syllable of text, the notational patterns can only occur in [[melisma]]tic passages. Where syllables change frequently or where pitches are to be repeated, ligatures must be broken up into smaller ligatures or even single notes in so-called "syllabic notation", often creating difficulty for the singers, as was reported by Anonymous IV ({{harvnb|Apel|1961|loc=225}}; {{harvnb|Roesner|2001}}).

An '''ordo''' (plural ''ordines'') is a [[phrase (music)|phrase]] constructed from one or more statements of one modal pattern and ending in a rest. Ordines were described according to the number of repetitions and the position of the concluding rest. "Perfect" ordines ended with the first note of the pattern followed by a rest substituting for the second half of the pattern, and "imperfect" ordines ended in the last note of the pattern followed by a rest equal to the first part. Imperfect ordines are mostly theoretical and rare in practice, where perfect ordines predominate {{harv|Hoppin|1978|loc=223}}.

Other writers who covered the topic of rhythmic modes include Anonymous IV, who mentions the names of the composers Léonin and Pérotin as well as some of their major works, and [[Franco of Cologne]], writing around 1260, who recognized the limitations of the system and whose name became attached to the idea of representing the duration of a note by particular notational shapes, though in fact the idea had been known and used for some time before Franco {{harv|Hughes|1954b|loc=379–80}}. Lambertus described nine modes, and Anonymus IV said that, in England, a whole series of irregular modes was in use {{harv|Reece|1940|loc=288}}.

==History==
The School of Politics and International Relations at Nottingham was established in 1965 and was initially housed in the old Engineering Building. Richard Pear was the first Professor of Politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/politics/about-the-school/history.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324050255/http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/Politics/About-the-School/History.aspx |archivedate=2010-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Politics had previously been taught as early as 1959 as part of the Department of Social Science where Politics formed part of a joint degree in Politics and Economics.

In 1971 the Sir Francis Hill chair was established following an endowment from the Municipal Mutual Insurance Company and Frank Stacey, an expert in local government was appointed. In 1981 [[Dennis Kavanagh]] joined the school. Kavanagh is best known for his work on the [[Nuffield Election Studies]]. The School moved to the 'Orchards' Building during the 1980s. Several new degrees were introduced during the 1980s including an MA in Political Economy and Political Culture and a joint BA in Politics and History and an MA in International Relations.

In 1994 the head of department Dr David Regan committed suicide by [[carbon monoxide poisoning]]  and cited his treatment by the University of Nottingham in a suicide note. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/pressure-for-nottingham-suicide-inquiry-continues/98080.article|title=Pressure for Nottingham suicide inquiry continues|date=3 February 1995|website=Timeshighereducation.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999 moved to the Law and Social Sciences Building (LASS) and changed its name to the ‘School of Politics and International Relations' in 2005.
In 2011 the school gained national media attention following the arrest of two  student one of whom was completing a PhD related to terrorism.  Dr Rod Thornton published a paper critical of the department’s handling of the incident and was subsequently suspended. Thornton later left by “mutual consent”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.impactnottingham.com/2012/06/dr-rod-thornton-leaves-the-university-after-mutual-agreement/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-06-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307143141/http://www.impactnottingham.com/2012/06/dr-rod-thornton-leaves-the-university-after-mutual-agreement/# |archive-date=2014-03-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===David Regan===
In 1994 the then head of the department [[David Regan (academic)|David Regan]] killed himself in a protest against decisions made by management at the University of Nottingham which he disagreed with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/suicide-was-sacrificial-1448829.html|title=Suicide 'was sacrificial'|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University rejected calls for a public inquiry into the death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/academics-call-for-inquiry-into-sacrificial-suicide-1571725.html|title=Academics call for inquiry into `sacrificial' suicide|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nottingham Two===
{{main|Nottingham Two}}
The School received international media attention in 2011 when an academic in the department [[Rod Thornton]] published an academic paper critical of the department and the [[University of Nottingham]]'s handling of the arrest of a student called [[Rizwaan Sabir]] who was completing a PhD thesis on terrorism. Mr Sabir downloaded a copy of an Al-Qaeda training manual from a US government website and was wrongly arrested on terrorism charges. The University of Nottingham described the paper as defamatory to a number of Thornton's colleagues in the department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-13350702|title=Chomsky concern over 'suspension'|date=10 May 2011|accessdate=18 October 2018|website=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thornton later apologized for inaccuracies in his paper and left his job by mutual consent.

===Miwa Hirono visa controversy===
In 2015 [[Times Higher Education]] reported that the Home Office had refused a visa for the academic [[Miwa Hirono]], an expert on Chinese foreign policy,  on the basis she had spent around 200 days in the past five years resident in China researching China's foreign peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. Matthew Humphrey, head of Nottingham’s School of Politics and International Relations said that the policy was “vindictive and bone-headed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/visa-refusal-for-china-expert-miwa-hirono-is-pure-madness/2019182.article#.VQo4JuTMIac.twitter|title=Visa refusal for China expert Miwa Hirono is ‘pure madness’|date=19 March 2015|website=Timeshighereducation.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2020">'''Sculptured stones''' is a name applied to commemorative monuments of [[early Christian]] date found in various parts of the [[British Isles]] and [[Scandinavia]].

They are usually rough-hewn slabs or boulders, and in a few cases well-shaped crosses, bearing lettered and symbolic inscriptions of a rude sort and ornamental designs resembling those found on [[Celt]]ic scriptures of the [[Gospels]]. Their lettered inscriptions are in [[Latin]], [[Ogam]] or [[Viking|Scandinavian]] and [[Angles|Anglican]] [[runes]], while some are uninscribed. Sculptured stones are usually found near ancient [[Church (building)|ecclesiastical]] sites, and their date is approximately fixed according to the character of the ornamentation. Some of these stones date as late as the 11th century. The [[Pictish stones]] from [[Scotland]] are particularly remarkable for their elaborate decoration and for certain symbolic characters to which as yet no satisfactory interpretation has been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pictishstones.org.uk/

'''Toxicology''' is a [[discipline (academia)|discipline]], overlapping with [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[pharmacology]], and [[medicine]], that involves the study of the [[adverse effect]]s of [[chemical substance]]s on living [[organism]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toxicologysource.com/whatistoxicology.html |title=What is Toxicology |last=Schrager |first=TF |date=October 4, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310233247/http://www.toxicologysource.com/whatistoxicology.html |archivedate=March 10, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the practice of [[diagnosis|diagnosing]] and [[therapy|treating]] exposures to [[toxin]]s and [[toxicant]]s. The [[dose–response relationship|relationship between dose and its effects on the exposed organism]] is of high significance in toxicology. Factors that influence chemical [[toxicity]] include the dosage (and whether it is acute or chronic), route of exposure, species, age, sex, and environment. '''Toxicologists''' are experts on [[poison]]s and [[poisoning]].

== History ==
[[File:Mathieu Joseph Bonaventure Orfila.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lithograph]] of [[Mathieu Orfila]]]]

[[Dioscorides]], a Greek physician in the court of the Roman emperor [[Nero]], made the first attempt to classify plants according to their toxic and therapeutic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hodgson |first=Ernest |year=2010 |title=A Textbook of Modern Toxicology |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |page=10 |isbn=978-0-470-46206-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Wahshiyya]] wrote the ''Book on Poisons'' in the 9th or 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levey |first=Martin |year=1966 |title=Medieval Arabic Toxicology: The Book on Poisons of ibn Wahshiyya and its Relation to Early Native American and Greek Texts}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was followed up in 1360 by [[Khagendra Mani Darpana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Taxonomical outlines of bio-diversity of Karnataka in a 14th century Kannada toxicology text Khagendra Mani Darpana|first1=Sathyanarayana|last1=Bhat|first2=Kumaraswamy|last2=Udupa|date=1 August 2013|journal=Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Biomedicine|volume=3|issue=8|pages=668–672 |doi=10.1016/S2221-1691(13)60134-3|pmid=23905027|pmc=3703563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mathieu Orfila]] is considered the modern father of toxicology, having given the subject its first formal treatment in 1813 in his ''Traité des poisons'', also called ''Toxicologie générale''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/visibleproofs/galleries/biographies/orfila.html |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |title=Biography of Mathieu Joseph Bonaventure Orfila (1787–1853)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850, [[Jean Stas]] became the first person to successfully isolate plant poisons from human tissue. This allowed him to identify the use of [[nicotine]] as a poison in the famous Bocarmé murder case, providing the evidence needed to convict the Belgian Count [[Hippolyte Visart de Bocarmé]] of killing his brother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wennig|first=Robert|date=April 2009|title=Back to the roots of modern analytical toxicology: Jean Servais Stas and the Bocarmé murder case|journal=[[Drug Testing and Analysis (journal)|Drug Testing and Analysis]]|volume=1|issue=4|pages=153–155|pmid = 20355192|doi = 10.1002/dta.32 | oclc =| id = | url = | language = | laysummary = | laysource = | laydate = | quote =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theophrastus Phillipus Auroleus Bombastus von Hohenheim (1493–1541) (also referred to as [[Paracelsus]], from his belief that his studies were above or beyond the work of [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]]&amp;nbsp;– a Roman physician from the first century) is also considered "the father" of toxicology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindfully.org/Pesticide/Paracelsus-Dose-ToxicologyOct01.htm |title=Paracelsus Dose Response in the Handbook of Pesticide Toxicology WILLIAM C KRIEGER / Academic Press Oct01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with the classic toxicology maxim, "''Alle Dinge sind Gift und nichts ist ohne Gift; allein die Dosis macht, dass ein Ding kein Gift ist.''" which translates as, "All things are poisonous and nothing is without poison; only the dose makes a thing not poisonous." This is often condensed to: "[[The dose makes the poison]]" or in Latin "Sola dosis facit venenum".&lt;ref name=Ottoboni&gt;{{cite book| last = Ottoboni |first=M.

== Basic principles==

The goal of toxicity assessment is to identify [[adverse effects]] of a substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Committee on Risk Assessment of Hazardous Air Pollutants, Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council |title= Science and judgement in risk assessment |publisher=The National Academic Press |location= |year=1994|page=56 |isbn= 978-0-309-07490-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adverse effects depend on two main factors: i) routes of exposure (oral, inhalation, or dermal) and ii) dose (duration and concentration of exposure).  To explore dose, substances are tested in both acute and chronic models.&lt;ref name= d1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.epa.gov/region8/human-health-toxicity-assessment|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agencies|title=Human Health Toxicity Assessment}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, different sets of experiments are conducted to determine whether a substance causes cancer and to examine other forms of toxicity.&lt;ref name=d1/&gt;

Factors that influence chemical toxicity:&lt;ref name=Ottoboni/&gt;
*Dosage
**Both large single exposures (acute) and continuous small exposures (chronic) are studied.
*Route of exposure
**Ingestion, inhalation or skin absorption
*Other factors
**Species
**Age
**Sex
**Health
**Environment
**Individual characteristics

== Testing methods ==

The classic experimental tool of toxicology is testing on non-human animals.&lt;ref name=Ottoboni/&gt; An example of a model organism is ''[[Galleria mellonella]],'' which can replace small mammals to study toxicology in vivo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harding|first=Clare R.|last2=Schroeder|first2=Gunnar N.|last3=Collins|first3=James W.|last4=Frankel|first4=Gad|date=2013-11-22|title=Use of ''Galleria mellonella'' as a Model Organism to Study ''Legionella pneumophila'' Infection|url=https://www.jove.com/video/50964/use-galleria-mellonella-as-model-organism-to-study-legionella|journal=Journal of Visualized Experiments|issue=81|pages=50964|doi=10.3791/50964|pmid=24299965|issn=1940-087X|pmc=3923569}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, such [[animal testing]] provides information that is not available by other means about how substances function in a living organism.&lt;ref name=SocTox2014&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toxicology.org/ms/air1.asp |publisher=Society of Toxicology |title=The importance of animal in research |date=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207062218/http://www.toxicology.org/ms/air1.asp |archivedate=2014-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of non-human animals for toxicology testing is opposed by some organisations for reasons of animal welfare, and it has been restricted or banned under some circumstances in certain regions, such as the testing of cosmetics in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Kanter | first = James | date = March 11, 2013 | title = E.U.

=== Alternative testing methods ===
While testing in animal models remains as a method of estimating human effects, there are both ethical and technical concerns with animal testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date = 8 September 2011 | title = Existing Non-animal Alternatives | publisher = AltTox.org | url = http://alttox.org/ttrc/existing-alternatives/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1950s, the field of toxicology has sought to reduce or eliminate animal testing under the rubric of "Three Rs" - reduce the number of experiments with animals to the minimum necessary; refine experiments to cause less suffering, and replace ''in vivo'' experiments with other types, or use more simple forms of life when possible.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.toxicology.org/script/admin/toxtopics/114517_AM_TT3_InVitro_SOT.pdf|title=Alternative toxicity test methods: reducing, refining and replacing animal use for safety testing |publisher= Society of Toxicology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan M. Goldberg. [http://altweb.jhsph.edu/altex/27_2/rPL7_Goldberg2.pdf The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique: Is It Relevant Today?] Altex 27, Special Issue 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer modeling is an example of alternative testing methods;  using computer models of chemicals and proteins, [[Structure–activity relationship|structure-activity relationships]] can be determined, and chemical structures that are likely to bind to, and interfere with, proteins with essential functions, can be identified.&lt;ref name=c1&gt;{{cite book |author1=Leeuwen van.C.J. |author2=Vermeire T.G. |title= Risk assessment of chemicals: An introduction |publisher=Springer |location=New York |year=2007|pages=451–479 |isbn=978-1-4020-6102-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This work requires expert knowledge in molecular modeling and statistics together with expert judgment in chemistry, biology and toxicology.&lt;ref name=c1/&gt;

In 2007 the American NGO [[National Academy of Sciences]] published a report called "Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy" which opened with a statement: "Change often involves a pivotal event that builds on previous history and opens the door to a new era. Pivotal events in science include the discovery of penicillin, the elucidation of the DNA double helix, and the development of computers. ...Toxicity testing is approaching such a scientific pivot point. It is poised to take advantage of the revolutions in biology and biotechnology. Advances in toxicogenomics, bioinformatics, systems biology, epigenetics, and computational toxicology could transform toxicity testing from a system based on whole-animal testing to one founded primarily on in vitro methods that evaluate changes in biologic processes using cells, cell lines, or cellular components, preferably of human origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=National Research Council|title=Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy|date=2007|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=9780309151733|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/11970/toxicity-testing-in-the-21st-century-a-vision-and-a}}  [http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/materials-based-on-reports/reports-in-brief/Toxicity_Testing_final.pdf Lay summary]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014 that vision was still unrealized.&lt;ref name=SocTox2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20574894|pmc=4410863 | doi=10.1080/10937404.2010.483176 | volume=13|issue=2–4 |title=Toxicity testing in the 21st century: a vision and a strategy|author=Krewski D, Acosta D Jr, Andersen M, Anderson H, Bailar JC 3rd, Boekelheide K, Brent R, Charnley G, Cheung VG, Green S Jr, Kelsey KT, Kerkvliet NI, Li AA, McCray L, Meyer O, Patterson RD, Pennie W, Scala RA, Solomon GM, Stephens M, Yager J, Zeise L|journal=J Toxicol Environ Health B Crit Rev|pages=51–138|year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases shifts away from animal studies has been mandated by law or regulation; the European Union (EU) prohibited use of animal testing for cosmetics in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Adler. S. |author2=et. al |title= Alternative (non-animal)methods for cosmetic testing: current status and future prospects - 2010|journal= Arch Toxicol |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=367–485 |year=2011|doi= 10.1007/s00204-011-0693-2|pmid=21533817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dose response complexities ==
Most chemicals display a classic dose response curve&amp;nbsp;– at a low dose (below a threshold), no effect is observed.&lt;ref name=Ottoboni/&gt;{{rp|80}}  Some show a phenomenon known as sufficient challenge&amp;nbsp;– a small exposure produces animals that "grow more rapidly, have better general appearance and coat quality, have fewer tumors, and live longer than the control animals".{{sfn|Ottoboni|1991|pp=83-85}}
A few chemicals have no well-defined safe level of exposure.  These are treated with special care.  Some chemicals are subject to
bioaccumulation as they are stored in rather than being excreted from the body;&lt;ref name=Ottoboni/&gt;{{rp|85–90}} these also receive special consideration.

Several measures are commonly used to describe toxic dosages according to the degree of effect on an organism or a population, and some are specifically defined by various laws or organizational usage.  These include:
* LD50 = [[Median lethal dose]], a dose that will kill 50% of an exposed population
* NOEL = No Observed Effect Level, the highest dose known to show no effect
* NOAEL = No Observed Adverse Effect Level, the highest dose known to show no adverse effects
* PEL = Permissible Exposure Limit, the highest concentration permitted under US [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] regulations
* STEL = Short-Term Exposure Limit, the highest concentration permitted for short periods of time, in general 15–30 minutes
* TWA = Time-Weighted Average, the average amount of an agent's concentration over a specified period of time, usually 8 hours.
*TTC = Threshold of Toxicological Concern have been established for the constituents of [[tobacco smoke]]&lt;ref name="TalhoutSchulz2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Talhout|first1=Reinskje|last2=Schulz|first2=Thomas|last3=Florek|first3=Ewa|last4=Van Benthem|first4=Jan|last5=Wester|first5=Piet|last6=Opperhuizen|first6=Antoon|title=Hazardous Compounds in Tobacco Smoke|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=8|issue=12|year=2011|pages=613–628|issn=1660-4601|doi=10.3390/ijerph8020613|pmid=21556207|pmc=3084482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Toxicology as a profession ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
A '''toxicologist''' is a scientist or medical personnel who specializes in the study of symptoms, mechanisms, treatments and detection of [[venom]]s and [[toxin]]s; especially the [[poison]]ing of people.

=== Requirements ===
To work as a toxicologist one should obtain a degree in toxicology or a related degree like [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[pharmacology]] or [[biochemistry]]. Bachelor's degree programs in toxicology cover the chemical makeup of toxins and their effects on biochemistry, physiology and ecology. After introductory life science courses are complete, students typically enroll in labs and apply toxicology principles to research and other studies. Advanced students delve into specific sectors, like the pharmaceutical industry or law enforcement, which apply methods of toxicology in their work. The [[Society of Toxicology]] (SOT) recommends that undergraduates in postsecondary schools that don't offer a bachelor's degree in toxicology consider attaining a degree in biology or chemistry.  Additionally, the SOT advises aspiring toxicologists to take statistics and mathematics courses, as well as gain laboratory experience through lab courses, student research projects and internships.

=== Duties ===
Toxicologists perform many different duties including research in the academic, nonprofit and industrial fields, product safety evaluation, consulting, public service and legal regulation. In order to research and assess the effects of chemicals, toxicologists perform carefully designed studies and experiments. These experiments help identify the specific amount of a chemical that may cause harm and potential risks of being near or using products that contain certain chemicals. Research projects may range from assessing the effects of toxic pollutants on the environment to evaluating how the human immune system responds to chemical compounds within pharmaceutical drugs. While the basic duties of toxicologists are to determine the effects of chemicals on organisms and their surroundings, specific job duties may vary based on industry and employment. For example, forensic toxicologists may look for toxic substances in a crime scene, whereas aquatic toxicologists may analyze the toxicity level of water bodies.

=== Compensation ===
The salary for jobs in toxicology is dependent on several factors, including level of schooling, specialization, experience. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) notes that jobs for biological scientists, which generally include toxicologists, were expected to increase by 21% between 2008 and 2018. The BLS notes that this increase could be due to research and development growth in biotechnology, as well as budget increases for basic and medical research in biological science.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word ''toxicology'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|t|ɒ|k|s|ᵻ|ˈ|k|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}) is a [[classical compound|neoclassical compound]] from [[New Latin]], first attested circa 1799,&lt;ref name="MWU"&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Unabridged Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/unabridged/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the combining forms ''[[wikt:toxico-#Prefix|toxico-]]'' + ''[[wikt:-logy#Suffix|-logy]]'', which in turn come from the [[Ancient Greek]] words [[wikt:τοξικός#Ancient Greek|τοξικός]] ''toxikos'', "poisonous", and [[wikt:λόγος#Ancient Greek|λόγος]] ''logos'', "subject matter").
