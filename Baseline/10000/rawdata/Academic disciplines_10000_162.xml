American Academy of Environmental Engineers
}}
The '''American Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists''' ('''AAEES''') is a society of professional [[Engineering|engineers]] and scientists who have demonstrated special expertise in [[environmental engineering]] or [[Environmental science|science]] beyond that normally required for professional practice, in a process similar to what is required for medical and other professional specialty certifications.

In addition to education and experience, Board-Certified Environmental Engineers and Scientists must have passed written and oral examinations and reviews by an admission panel of the Academy. The Academy's certification program is accredited by the Council of Engineering and Scientific Specialty Boards.&lt;ref name="Brochure"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaee.net/DownloadCenter/BecomeBoardCertified-AAEES.pdf |title=Be Recognized  Among the Best Environmental Engineers and Scientists In the World |publisher=American Academy of Engineers and Scientists |accessdate=2012-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217162800/http://www.aaee.net/DownloadCenter/BecomeBoardCertified-AAEES.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy was founded in 1955 for the principal purpose of serving the public by improving the practice, elevating the standards, and advancing public recognition of environmental engineering through a program of specialty certification of qualified engineers.

The Academy began in 1952, when a group of [[sanitary engineering|sanitary engineers]] working in the [[public health]] and [[defense industry|defense]] communities expressed concern about the requirements for professional practice. This led to the creation of the Committee for the Advancement of Sanitary Engineering of the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE). Later, the Joint Committee for the Advancement of Sanitary Engineering was formed, composed of the ASCE, the [[American Public Health Association]], the [[American Society for Engineering Education]], the [[American Water Works Association]] and the [[Water Environment Federation|Water Pollution Control Federation]]. With the sponsorship and support of these five organizations, the American Sanitary Engineering Intersociety Board was incorporated under the laws of the State of [[Delaware]] on October 21, 1955. Certified sanitary engineers were identified as Diplomates (now also known as Board Certified Environmental Engineers) of the American Academy of Sanitary Engineers, and were listed on a roster with the names of each member and their specialties as recognized by the Board. Other organizations joining as sponsors included the [[American Institute of Chemical Engineers]] in 1957 and the [[Air Pollution]] Control Association in 1962.

In 1966 the name of the Board was changed to the "Environmental Engineering Intersociety Board" (EEIB) and the name of the roster from the "American Academy of Sanitary Engineers" to the "American Academy of Environmental Engineers" (AAEE). A year later, in 1967, the Board of Trustees changed the American Academy of Environmental Engineers from just a roster of certified engineers to an organization with its own rights, bylaws and officers. This new organization was charged with working cooperatively with the EEIB in the advancement of all aspects of environmental engineering. The [[American Public Works Association]] joined as a sponsor of these organizations in 1969. The AAEE and the EEIB were merged into one organization in 1973. In 1976 the [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] became a sponsor of the Academy and it was followed by the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors in 1977, the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] in 1981 and the Solid Waste Association of North America in 1988. In 2011, the Academy decided to award board certifications to environmental scientists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.aaee.net/DownloadCenter/AAEE-BCESPressRelease.pdf |title=AAEE Approves Environmental Scientist Certification/Name Change |publisher=American Academy of Environmental Engineers |date=2011-12-20 |accessdate=2012-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217160727/http://www.aaee.net/DownloadCenter/AAEE-BCESPressRelease.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the adoption of its current name on 1 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://myemail.constantcontact.com/AAEE-Highpoints---September-2012.html?soid=1102273204531&amp;aid=XxW79TH9tls |title=Environmental Engineering Foundation Votes To Change Name To Environmental Engineering and Science Foundation |volume=28 |number=8 |date=November 2012 |journal=Highlights |publisher=American Academy of Environmental Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Requirements for board certification include a baccalaureate or higher degree in engineering or science from an accredited university, not less than eight years of professional engineering or scientific experience, and an examination on the practice of environmental engineering or science in a particular area of specialization. Exams are offered on the following topics for engineers: [[Air pollution|Air Pollution Control]], [[Sustainability|Environmental Sustainability]], General Environmental Engineering, [[Hazardous waste|Hazardous Waste Management]], [[Industrial hygiene|Industrial Hygiene]], Radiation Protection, [[Waste management|Solid Waste Management]] and Water Supply/Wastewater Management.  Scientists may choose from tests covering Air Resources, Environmental Biology, [[Environmental chemistry|Environmental Chemistry]], [[Environmental microbiology|Environmental Microbiology]], [[Environmental toxicology|Environmental Toxicology]], Groundwater and the Subsurface Environment, Surface Water Resources, or [[Sustainability science|Sustainability Science]].&lt;ref name="Brochure"/&gt;

An '''aquatic ecosystem''' is an [[ecosystem]]  in a [[body of water]]. [[Biocoenosis|Communities]] of [[biota (ecology)|organisms]] that are dependent on each other and on their environment live in aquatic ecosystems. The two main types of aquatic ecosystems are [[marine ecosystem]]s and [[freshwater ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Alexander| first = David E.| title = Encyclopedia of Environmental Science| publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]| date = 1 May 1999| isbn = 0-412-74050-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Marine ecosystem}}
Marine ecosystems, the largest of all ecosystems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=University of California Museum of Paleontology: The Marine Biome|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/biomes/marine.php?|accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; cover approximately 71% of the [[Earth's surface]] and contain approximately 97% of the planet's water. They generate 32% of the world's net [[primary production]].&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;{{cite book| last = Alexander| first = David E.| title = Encyclopedia of Environmental Science| publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]| date = 1 May 1999| isbn = 0-412-74050-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are distinguished from freshwater ecosystems by the presence of dissolved [[chemical compound|compounds]], especially [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s, in the water. Approximately 85% of the dissolved materials in [[seawater]] are [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]]. Seawater has an average salinity of 35 [[parts-per notation|parts per thousand]] of water. Actual salinity varies among different marine ecosystems.&lt;ref name=USEPA&gt;{{cite web| last = United States Environmental Protection Agency| authorlink = United States Environmental Protection Agency| title = Marine Ecosystems| date = 2 March 2006| url = http://www.epa.gov/bioiweb1/aquatic/marine.html| accessdate = 2006-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:oceanic divisions.svg|thumb|300px|right|A classification of marine habitats.]]
Marine ecosystems can be divided into many zones depending upon water depth and shoreline features. The [[ocean]]ic zone is the vast open part of the ocean where animals such as whales, sharks, and tuna live.  The [[benthic]] zone consists of substrates below water where many invertebrates live. The [[intertidal zone|intertidal]] zone is the area between high and low tides; in this figure it is termed the littoral zone. Other near-shore (neritic) zones can include [[estuary|estuaries]], [[salt marsh]]es, [[coral reef]]s, [[lagoon]]s and [[mangrove]] swamps.  In the deep water, [[hydrothermal vent]]s may occur where [[Chemosynthesis|chemosynthetic]] [[sulfur]] [[bacteria]] form the base of the food web.

[[class (biology)|Classes]] of organisms found in marine ecosystems include [[brown algae]], [[dinoflagellate]]s, [[coral]]s, [[cephalopod]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, and [[shark]]s. Fishes caught in marine ecosystems are the biggest source of commercial foods obtained from wild populations.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

Environmental problems concerning marine ecosystems include unsustainable exploitation of marine resources (for example [[overfishing]] of certain species), [[marine pollution]], [[Fisheries and climate change|climate change]], and building on coastal areas.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

===Freshwater===

{{main|Freshwater ecosystem}}

[[File:Panorama presa las niñas mogan gran canaria.jpg|thumb|640px|left|Freshwater ecosystem.]]{{clear}}
Freshwater ecosystems cover 0.78% of the Earth's surface and inhabit 0.009% of its total water. They generate nearly 3% of its net primary production.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; Freshwater ecosystems contain 41% of the world's known fish species.&lt;ref name=Daily&gt;{{cite book

There are three basic types of freshwater ecosystems:
*[[Lentic system ecology|Lentic]]: slow moving water, including [[pond|pool]]s, [[pond]]s, and [[lake]]s.
*[[Lotic System Ecology|Lotic]]: faster moving water, for example [[stream]]s and [[river]]s.
*[[Wetland]]s: areas where the soil is saturated or inundated for at least part of the time.&lt;ref name=Vaccari&gt;{{cite book

===Lentic ===
{{see also|Lake ecosystem}}

[[File:Primary zones of a lake.png|thumb|400px|right|The three primary zones of a lake.]]
Lake ecosystems can be divided into zones. One common system divides lakes into three zones (see figure).  The first, the [[littoral zone]], is the shallow zone near the shore. This is where rooted wetland plants occur.  The offshore is divided into two further zones, an open water zone and a deep water zone.  In the open water zone (or photic zone) sunlight supports photosynthetic algae, and the species that feed upon them.  In the deep water zone, sunlight is not available and the food web is based on detritus entering from the littoral and photic zones.  Some systems use other names.  The off shore areas may be called the [[pelagic zone]], the [[photic zone]] may be called the [[limnetic zone]] and the [[aphotic zone]] may be called the [[profundal zone]]. Inland from the littoral zone one can also frequently identify a [[riparian zone]] which has plants still affected by the presence of the lake—this can include effects from windfalls, spring flooding, and winter ice damage. The production of the lake as a whole is the result of production from plants growing in the littoral zone, combined with production from plankton growing in the open water.

[[Wetland]]s can be part of the lentic system, as they form naturally along most lake shores, the width of the wetland and littoral zone being dependent upon the slope of the shoreline and the amount of natural change in water levels, within and among years. Often dead trees accumulate in this zone, either from windfalls on the shore or logs transported to the site during floods.  This woody debris provides important habitat for fish and nesting birds, as well as protecting shorelines from erosion.

Two important subclasses of lakes are [[pond]]s, which typically are small lakes that intergrade with wetlands, and water [[reservoir]]s. Over long periods of time, lakes, or bays within them, may gradually become enriched by nutrients and slowly fill in with organic sediments, a process called succession. When humans use the watershed, the volumes of sediment entering the lake can accelerate this process. The addition of sediments and nutrients to a lake is known as [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

====Ponds====

Ponds are small bodies of freshwater with shallow and still water, [[marsh]], and [[aquatic plants]].&lt;ref&gt;Clegg, J. (1986). Observer's Book of Pond Life. Frederick Warne, London. 460 p.&lt;/ref&gt; They can be further divided into four zones: vegetation zone, open water, bottom mud and surface film.&lt;ref&gt;Clegg, J. (1986). Observer's Book of Pond Life. Frederick Warne, London. 460 p. p.160-163.&lt;/ref&gt; The size and depth of ponds often varies greatly with the time of year; many ponds are produced by spring flooding from rivers. [[Food web]]s are based both on free-floating [[algae]] and upon aquatic plants. There is usually a diverse array of aquatic life, with a few examples including algae, snails, fish, beetles, water bugs, frogs, turtles, otters and muskrats. Top predators may include large fish, herons, or alligators.  Since fish are a major predator upon amphibian larvae, ponds that dry up each year, thereby killing resident fish, provide important refugia for amphibian breeding.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt; Ponds that dry up completely each year are often known as [[vernal pools]]. Some ponds are produced by animal activity, including alligator holes and beaver ponds, and these add important diversity to landscapes.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt;

===Lotic ===
{{see also|River ecosystem}}

The major zones in river ecosystems are determined by the river bed's gradient or by the velocity of the current. Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]], which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into [[upland and lowland (freshwater ecology)|upland and lowland]] rivers.  The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a [[canopy (forest)|canopy]] derive the majority of their food base from algae. [[Fish migration|Anadromous fish]] are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and [[introduced species]].&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed.  The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands.&lt;ref name= Keddy/&gt;

===Wetlands ===
Wetlands are dominated by [[vascular plant]]s that have adapted to saturated soil.&lt;ref name=Keddy&gt;{{cite book|last=Keddy|first=Paul A.|title=Wetland Ecology. Principles and Conservation.|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-51940-3|page=497}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four main types of wetlands: swamp, marsh, fen and bog (both fens and bogs are types of [[mire]]). Wetlands are the most productive natural ecosystems in the world because of the proximity of water and soil. Hence they support large numbers of plant and animal species. Due to their productivity, wetlands are often converted into dry land with [[ditch|dykes]] and [[drainage|drains]] and used for agricultural purposes. The construction of dykes, and dams, has negative consequences for individual wetlands and entire watersheds.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt; Their closeness to lakes and rivers means that they are often developed for human settlement.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; Once settlements are constructed and protected by dykes, the settlements then become vulnerable to land subsidence and ever increasing risk of flooding.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt;  The Louisiana coast around New Orleans is a well-known example;&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A., D. Campbell, T. McFalls, G. Shaffer, R. Moreau, C. Dranguet, and R. Heleniak.  2007. The wetlands of lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas: past, present and future.  Environmental Reviews 15: 1- 35.&lt;/ref&gt; the Danube Delta in Europe is another.&lt;ref&gt;Gastescu, P. (1993). The Danube Delta: geographical characteristics and ecological recovery. Earth and Environmental Science, 29, 57–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
Aquatic ecosystems perform many important environmental functions. For example, they [[biogeochemical cycle|recycle nutrients]], purify water, attenuate floods, recharge ground water and provide habitats for wildlife.&lt;ref name=Loeb&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Loeb
  | first = Stanford L.
  | title = Biological Monitoring of Aquatic Systems
  | publisher = [[CRC Press]]
  | date = 24 January 1994
  | isbn = 0-87371-910-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquatic ecosystems are also used for human recreation, and are very important to the [[tourism]] industry, especially in coastal regions.&lt;ref name=Daily/&gt;

The health of an aquatic ecosystem is degraded when the ecosystem's ability to absorb a stress has been exceeded. A stress on an aquatic ecosystem can be a result of physical, chemical or biological alterations of the environment. Physical alterations include changes in water temperature, water flow and light availability. Chemical alterations include changes in the loading rates of biostimulatory nutrients, oxygen consuming materials, and toxins. Biological alterations include over-harvesting of commercial species and the introduction of exotic species. Human populations can impose excessive stresses on aquatic ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Loeb/&gt; There are many examples of excessive stresses with negative consequences. Consider three. The environmental history of the Great Lakes of North America illustrates this problem, particularly how multiple stresses, such as water pollution, over-harvesting and invasive species can combine.&lt;ref name="Vallentyne, J. R. 1974"&gt;Vallentyne, J. R. (1974). The Algal Bowl: Lakes and Man, Miscellaneous Special Publication No. 22. Ottawa, ON: Department of the Environment, Fisheries and Marine Service.&lt;/ref&gt; The Norfolk Broadlands in England illustrate similar decline with pollution and invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, B. (1983). The Norfolk Broadland: experiments in the restoration of a complex wetland. Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, 58, 521–561.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lake Pontchartrain along the Gulf of Mexico illustrates the negative effects of different stresses including levee construction, logging of swamps, invasive species and salt water intrusion.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P. A., Campbell, D., McFalls T., Shaffer, G., Moreau, R., Dranguet, C., and Heleniak, R. (2007). The wetlands of lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas: past, present and future. Environmental Reviews, 15, 1–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abiotic characteristics==
An ecosystem is composed of [[Biotic component|biotic]] communities that are structured by biological interactions and [[abiotic]] environmental factors. Some of the important abiotic environmental factors of aquatic ecosystems include substrate type, water depth, nutrient levels, temperature, salinity, and flow.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Loeb/&gt; It is often difficult to determine the relative importance of these factors without rather large experiments.  There may be complicated feedback loops.  For example, sediment may determine the presence of aquatic plants, but aquatic plants may also trap sediment, and add to the sediment through peat.

The amount of dissolved oxygen in a water body is frequently the key substance in determining the extent and kinds of organic life in the water body. Fish need dissolved oxygen to survive, although their tolerance to low oxygen varies among species; in extreme cases of low oxygen some fish even resort to air gulping.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, J. B. (1997). Air Breathing Fishes. San Diego, CA: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Plants often have to produce [[aerenchyma]], while the shape and size of leaves may also be altered.&lt;ref&gt;Sculthorpe, C. D. (1967). The Biology of Aquatic Vascular Plants. Reprinted 1985 Edward Arnold, by London.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, oxygen is fatal to many kinds of [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] bacteria.&lt;ref name=Manahan&gt;{{cite book| last = Manahan| first = Stanley E.| title = Environmental Chemistry| publisher = [[CRC Press]]| date = 1 January 2005| isbn = 1-56670-633-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nutrient levels are important in controlling the abundance of many species of algae.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, V. H. (1982). The nitrogen and phosphorus dependence of algal biomass in lakes: an empirical and theoretical analysis. Limnology and Oceanography, 27, 1101–12.&lt;/ref&gt;  The relative abundance of nitrogen and phosphorus can in effect determine which species of algae come to dominate.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, V. H. (1983). Low nitrogen to phosphorus ratios favor dominance by bluegreen algae in lake phytoplankton. Science, 221, 669–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Algae are a very important source of food for aquatic life, but at the same time, if they become over-abundant, they can cause declines in fish when they decay.&lt;ref name="Vallentyne, J. R. 1974"/&gt; Similar over-abundance of algae in coastal environments such as the Gulf of Mexico produces, upon decay, a hypoxic region of water known as a [[Dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, R. E. and Rabelais, N. N. (2003). Linking landscape and water quality in the Mississippi River Basin for 200 years. BioScience, 53, 563–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The salinity of the water body is also a determining factor in the kinds of species found in the water body. Organisms in marine ecosystems tolerate salinity, while many freshwater organisms are intolerant of salt. The degree of salinity in an estuary or delta is an important control upon the type of [[wetland]] (fresh, intermediate, or brackish), and the associated animal species.  Dams built upstream may reduce spring flooding, and reduce sediment accretion, and may therefore lead to saltwater intrusion in coastal wetlands.&lt;ref name = Keddy/&gt;

Freshwater used for [[irrigation]] purposes often absorbs levels of salt that are harmful to freshwater organisms.&lt;ref name=Manahan/&gt;

==Biotic characteristics==
The biotic characteristics are mainly determined by the organisms that occur.  For example, wetland plants may produce dense canopies that cover large areas of sediment—or snails or geese may graze the vegetation leaving large mud flats. Aquatic environments have relatively low oxygen levels, forcing adaptation by the organisms found there.  For example, many wetland plants must produce [[aerenchyma]] to carry oxygen to roots. Other biotic characteristics are more subtle and difficult to measure, such as the relative importance of competition, mutualism or predation.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt; There are a growing number of cases where predation by coastal herbivores including snails, geese and mammals appears to be a dominant biotic factor.&lt;ref&gt;Silliman, B. R., Grosholz, E. D., and Bertness, M. D. (eds.) (2009). Human Impacts on Salt Marshes: A Global Perspective. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autotrophic organisms===
[[Autotroph]]ic organisms are producers that generate organic compounds from inorganic material. Algae use solar energy to generate biomass from carbon dioxide and are possibly the most important autotrophic organisms in aquatic environments.&lt;ref name=Manahan/&gt; The more shallow the water, the greater the biomass contribution from rooted and floating vascular plants. These two sources combine to produce the extraordinary production of estuaries and wetlands, as this autotrophic biomass is converted into fish, birds, amphibians and other aquatic species.

Chemosynthetic bacteria are found in benthic marine ecosystems. These organisms are able to feed on [[hydrogen sulfide]] in water that comes from [[volcanic vent]]s. Great concentrations of animals that feed on these bacteria are found around volcanic vents. For example, there are [[giant tube worm]]s (''Riftia pachyptila'') 1.5&amp;nbsp;m in length and clams (''[[Calyptogena magnifica]]'') 30&amp;nbsp;cm long.&lt;ref name=Chapman&gt;{{cite book| last = Chapman| first = J.L.|author2=Reiss, M.J.| title = Ecology| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]| date = 10 December 1998| isbn = 0-521-58802-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heterotrophic organisms===
[[Heterotrophic]] organisms consume autotrophic organisms and use the organic compounds in their bodies as energy sources and as raw materials to create their own [[biomass]].&lt;ref name=Manahan/&gt; [[Euryhaline]] organisms are salt tolerant and can survive in marine ecosystems, while [[stenohaline]] or salt intolerant species can only live in freshwater environments.&lt;ref name=USEPA/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7305">In [[biochemistry]], '''avidity''' refers to the accumulated strength of ''multiple'' affinities of individual [[non-covalent]] binding interactions, such as between a protein receptor and its ligand, and is commonly referred to as functional affinity. As such, avidity is distinct from [[chemical affinity|affinity]], which describes the strength of a ''single'' interaction. However, because individual binding events increase the likelihood of other interactions to occur (i.e. increase the local concentration of each binding partner in proximity to the binding site), avidity should not be thought of as the mere sum of its constituent affinities but as the combined effect of all affinities participating in the biomolecular interaction. A particular important aspect relates to the phenomenon of 'avidity entropy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kitov PI, Bundle DR |title=On the nature of the multivalency effect: a thermodynamic model |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=125 |issue=52 |pages=16271–84 |year=2003 |pmid=14692768 |doi=10.1021/ja038223n }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomolecules often form heterogenous complexes or homogeneous [[oligomer]]s and multimers or [[polymer]]s. If clustered proteins form an organized matrix, such as the [[clathrin]]-coat, the interaction is a described as [[matricity]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Antibody-antigen interaction==
Avidity is commonly applied to [[antibody]] interactions in which multiple antigen-binding sites simultaneously interact with the target [[antigen]]ic [[epitope]]s, often in multimerized structures. Individually, each binding interaction may be readily broken; however, when many binding interactions are present at the same time, transient unbinding of a single site does not allow the molecule to diffuse away, and binding of that weak interaction is likely to be restored.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Each antibody has at least two antigen-binding sites, therefore antibodies are bivalent to multivalent. Avidity (functional affinity) is the accumulated strength of multiple affinities.&lt;ref name="pmid19409036"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rudnick SI, Adams GP |title=Affinity and avidity in antibody-based tumor targeting |journal=Cancer Biotherapy &amp; Radiopharmaceuticals |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=155–61 |year=2009 |pmid=19409036 |pmc=2902227 |doi=10.1089/cbr.2009.0627 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[IgM]] is said to have low affinity but high avidity because it has 10 weak binding sites for antigen as opposed to the 2 stronger binding sites of [[IgG]], [[IgE]] and [[IgD]] with higher single binding affinities.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Affinity===
Binding affinity is a measure of dynamic equilibrium of the ratio of on-rate (k&lt;sub&gt;on&lt;/sub&gt;) and off-rate (k&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt;) under specific concentrations of reactants. The affinity constant, [[Equilibrium constant|K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]], is the inverse of the dissociation constant, [[Dissociation constant|K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The strength of complex formation in solution is related to the [[stability constants of complexes]], however in case of large biomolecules, such as [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]-[[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] pairs, their interaction is also dependent on other structural and thermodynamic properties of reactants plus their orientation and immobilization.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

There are several [[methods to investigate protein–protein interactions]] existing with differences in immobilization of each reactant in 2D or 3D orientation. The measured affinities are stored in public databases, such as the [[Ki Database]] and [[BindingDB]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} As an example, affinity is the binding strength between the complex structures of the [[epitope]] of antigenic determinant and [[paratope]] of antigen-binding site of an antibody. Participating non-covalent interactions may include [[hydrogen bond]]s, [[ionic bond|electrostatic bond]]s, [[van der Waals force]]s and [[hydrophobic effect|hydrophobic force]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Charles A |last1=Janeway |first2=Paul |last2=Travers |first3=Mark |last3=Walport |first4=Mark J |last4=Shlomchik |page=104 |year=2001 |title=Immunobiology |edition=5th |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10757/ |location=New York |publisher=Garland Science |isbn=0-8153-3642-X }}{{page needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calculation of binding affinity for bimolecular reaction (1 antibody binding site per 1 antigen):

:&lt;chem&gt;[Ab] + [Ag] &lt;=&gt; [AbAg]&lt;/chem&gt;

where [Ab] is the [[antibody]] concentration and [Ag] is the [[antigen]] concentration, either in free ([Ab],[Ag]) or bound ([AbAg]) state.

calculation of association constant (or [[equilibrium constant]]):   
:&lt;math chem&gt;K_a = \frac{k_\ce{on}}{k_\ce{off}} = \frac\ce{[AbAg]}\ce{[Ab][Ag]}&lt;/math&gt;

calculation of dissociation constant:  
:&lt;math chem&gt;K_d = \frac{k_\ce{off}}{k_\ce{on}} = \frac\ce{[Ab][Ag]}\ce{[AbAg]}&lt;/math&gt;

==Application==
Avidity tests for [[rubella virus]], ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV), [[varicella-zoster virus]], human immunodeficiency virus ([[HIV]]), [[viral hepatitis|hepatitis viruses]], [[Epstein-Barr virus]], and others were developed a few years ago. These tests help to distinguish acute, recurrent or past infection by avidity of marker-specific [[IgG]]. Currently there are two avidity assays in use. These are the well known chaotropic (conventional) assay and the recently developed AVIcomp (avidity competition) assay.&lt;ref name="pmid19129411"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Curdt I, Praast G, Sickinger E, Schultess J, Herold I, Braun HB, Bernhardt S, Maine GT, Smith DD, Hsu S, Christ HM, Pucci D, Hausmann M, Herzogenrath J |title=Development of fully automated determination of marker-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) avidity based on the avidity competition assay format: application for Abbott Architect cytomegalovirus and Toxo IgG Avidity assays |journal=Journal of Clinical Microbiology |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=603–13 |year=2009 |pmid=19129411 |pmc=2650902 |doi=10.1128/JCM.01076-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Baldy Center for Law &amp; Social Policy''' is a research center at the [[University at Buffalo]] that advances interdisciplinary research on law, legal institutions and social policy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buffalo.edu/baldycenter/about.html|title=About Us - Baldy Center - University at Buffalo|website=www.buffalo.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Founded in 1978, the Baldy Center is housed within UB’s [[University at Buffalo Law School|School of Law]] but serves faculty with law and policy interests throughout the university. The Center was endowed by a bequest from Christopher Baldy, a prominent [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] attorney and UB School of Law graduate who died in 1959&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.buffalo.edu/news.host.html/content/shared/law/articles/introducing-sociology-to-law.detail.html|title=Baldy Center celebrates its 40th anniversary - University at Buffalo School of Law - University at Buffalo|website=www.law.buffalo.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Activities ==
The Baldy Center sponsors interdisciplinary research focusing on the intersection of law and social policy, awarding research grants annually to scholars across the university, especially in law, the humanities and social sciences. It also hosts and sponsors conferences that bring together researchers from across the world to discuss their Law and Society-related research. A list of grants awarded for research and conferences and their recipients [http://www.buffalo.edu/baldycenter/research/g-recipients.html is available] at the Center's website.

The Center’s intensive book manuscript workshops are organized around drafts of books about law, legal institutions or social policy by UB-affiliated scholars. The interdisciplinary discussions are designed to provide feedback to the authors from interested faculty and outside specialists.

The Baldy Center maintains cooperative ties to other interdisciplinary research centers and cosponsors a regional network of sociolegal scholars in New York and Canada. The Center additionally hosts distinguished scholars from around the world as visitors, speakers, consultants and conference participants.

The Center offers postdoctoral fellowships to budding scholars hoping to join the academy at American and global universities, along with research fellowships and senior fellowships. Research fellowships link law-and-policy scholars into the Baldy community and its resources, while senior fellowships are geared toward accomplished academics from other universities whose projects are closely related to the Baldy Center’s mission.

Through the Buffalo Legal Studies Research Paper Series, hosted and distributed by the Social Science Research Network, the Center provides an international audience for faculty and visiting scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buffalo.edu/baldycenter.html|title=Baldy Center - University at Buffalo|website=www.buffalo.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
Christopher Baldy graduated from the Buffalo School of Law in 1910, in the days when UB was a private school. He died a bachelor and left most of his estate, initially valued at $1.4 million, to his three brothers, stipulating that when they died, the remainder would be a gift to UB.

A surrogate judge in 1973 approved using the Baldy funding to start a new program in law and social policy, a subject area favored by UB’s law dean, Red Schwartz, a sociologist and the first-ever non-interim dean of an American law school who was not a lawyer. Schwartz was a key figure in the Law and Society movement that emerged in the 1960s and sought to explore how the law actually interacted with society, as opposed to the more formalistic, theoretical and academic approach that permeated legal scholarship for much of the 20th century.

Five years later, under then-Dean Thomas Headrick, the program in law and social policy was formalized into the Baldy Center&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

From 1981 to 2009, the Center hosted the peer-reviewed academic journal Law &amp; Policy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=40 Years at the Baldy Center: A Law and Society Hub in Buffalo|last=Hammill|first=Luke|publisher=University at Buffalo|year=2018|isbn=978-0-578-40506-3|location=University at Buffalo Baldy Center for Law &amp; Social Policy|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

For much of its history, the Baldy Center’s activities were organized around working groups focused on specific research areas. The number of groups fluctuated over time and during the 1990s were concentrated into more formal Baldy Programs such as Environmental Law and Policy; Children, Families and the Law; Community and Difference; Law, Gender and Social Policy; Human Rights Law and Policy; and Regulation and Public Policy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=40 Years at the Baldy Center: A Law and Society Hub in Buffalo|last=Hammill|first=Luke|publisher=University at Buffalo|year=2018|isbn=978-0-578-40506-3|location=University at Buffalo Baldy Center for Law &amp; Social Policy|pages=61-82}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

After 2010, the Center retired the working groups model and instituted its fellowship program while continuing to focus on conferences, book manuscript workshops and supporting research&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=40 Years at the Baldy Center: A Law and Society Hub in Buffalo|last=Hammill|first=Luke|publisher=University at Buffalo|year=2018|isbn=978-0-578-40506-3|location=University at Buffalo Baldy Center for Law &amp; Social Policy|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Blog fiction''' is a form of blogging that can be defined as any forms of narrative written and published through online web journals such as LiveJournal. Fictional blogs are a changing phenomenon with great potential to young writers.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, AA, Fictional Blogs, Uses of Blogs, Peter Lang, Bruns, A &amp; Jacobs, J (ed), New York, pp. 199-210. {{ISBN|0820481246}} (2006) [Research Book Chapter]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the 20th century, there were various authors who were leading the change to bring about the end of the print book. They intend to replace it with a mode of expression that was nonlinear and free to cross as many boundaries as the ever-increasing powers of the computers were making possible.&lt;ref&gt;http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.mga.edu/eds/ebookviewer/ebook?sid=9590c575-d91b-46ef-a66d-65d75126b5d6@sessionmgr102&amp;ppid=Page-__-107&amp;vid=0&amp;format=EK {{full citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=Readers generally cannot access the university proxy link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, blog fiction was developed in 1965; however, it was referred to as a hypertext or web. Well-known philosopher and sociologist Ted Nelson coined the term hypertext. He defined hypertext as "a body of pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that is could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper." Although Ted Nelson was given credit for combining the term and defining hypertext, many people were confused on what tasks it could complete. Most people assumed that it involved linking, like the World Wide Web. After much confusion and speculation about hypertext, the first Hypertext Conference was held in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commforum.mit.edu/hypertext-in-historical-context-vannevar-bush-and-ted-nelson-revisited-bc527272125|title=Hypertext in Historical Context: Vannevar Bush and Ted Nelson Revisited|date=30 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fake or real blogs==
Fictional blogging is all about expressing ideas and creativity. Blog fiction or fictional blogging help readers find who they are. 

Fake blogs, also known as flogs, are misleading web sites that launch [[scareware]] and post ads and comments to a real blog site to lure readers to the page. The con artists who run these sites currently make an estimated $750 million a year by selling products of miracle cures to phony anti-virus software and items of questionable value. Most of them have one article posing as impartial new report commenting on a miracle product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scambusters.org/fakeblog.html|title=8 Clues That Point to a Fake Blog.html|website=www.scambusters.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real blog fiction===

Fictional blogging can be a personal journal or diary that is posted online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogbasics.com/what-is-a-blog/|title=What Is a Blog? - Blog Basics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Though many critics and literary scholars dismiss blog fiction as an inferior and faddish literary form, there is a trend towards the recognition of blogs as a legitimate arena of fiction production. For instance, self-publishing provider Lulu sponsors the [[Lulu Blooker Prize]], which began in 2006. The Blooker prize is an award given to the best "blook" of the year: a work of fiction begun as blog fiction and then transformed into a printed publication. Thus, even despite the radical and democratizing potential of blog fiction, printed works still maintain greater authority and "official" status in the world of fiction and academia. 

Some people{{who|date=December 2017}} say blog fiction is not true blogging and that blogs should not contain fake content. However, blog fiction and regular blogging are all the same.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} In fictional blogging, writers talk about fictional subject matter and also write about real life events but with fictional characteristics. Blog fiction is what a blogger makes of it.

The '''Brown University Standard Corpus of Present-Day American English''' (or just '''Brown Corpus''') was compiled in the 1960s by [[Henry Kučera]] and [[W. Nelson Francis]] at [[Brown University]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]] as a general [[Text corpus|corpus]] (text collection) in the field of [[corpus linguistics]]. It contains 500 samples of English-language text, totaling roughly one million words, compiled from works published in the United States in 1961.

==History==
In 1967, Kučera and Francis published their classic work ''Computational Analysis of Present-Day American English'', which provided basic statistics on what is known today simply as the ''Brown Corpus''. The Brown Corpus was a carefully compiled selection of current American English, totalling about a million words drawn from a wide variety of sources. Kučera and Francis subjected it to a variety of computational analyses, from which they compiled a rich and variegated opus, combining elements of linguistics, psychology, statistics, and sociology. It has been very widely used in [[computational linguistics]], and was for many years among the most-cited resources in the field.

Shortly after publication of the first [[Lexicostatistics|lexicostatistical]] analysis, [[Boston]] publisher Houghton-Mifflin approached Kučera to supply a million word, three-line citation base for its new ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]''. This ground-breaking new dictionary, which first appeared in 1969, was the first dictionary to be compiled using corpus linguistics for word frequency and other information.

The initial Brown Corpus had only the words themselves, plus a location identifier for each. Over the following several years part-of-speech tags were applied. The Greene and Rubin tagging program (see under [[part of speech tagging]]) helped considerably in this, but the high error rate meant that extensive manual proofreading was required.

The tagged Brown Corpus used a selection of about 80 parts of speech, as well as special indicators for compound forms, contractions, foreign words and a few other phenomena, and formed the basis for many later corpora such as the [[Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen Corpus]]. The tagged corpus enabled far more sophisticated statistical analysis, much of it carried out by graduate student Andrew Mackie. Some of the analysis appears in ''Frequency Analysis of English Usage: Lexicon and Grammar'', by Winthrop Nelson Francis and Henry Kučera, Houghton Mifflin (January, 1983) {{ISBN|0-395-32250-2}}.

One interesting result is that even for quite large samples, graphing words in order of decreasing frequency of occurrence shows a [[hyperbola]]: the frequency of the ''n''-th most frequent word is roughly proportional to 1/''n''. Thus "the" constitutes nearly 7% of the Brown Corpus, "to" and "of" more than another 3% each; while about half the total vocabulary of about 50,000 words are ''[[hapax legomena]]'': words that occur only once in the corpus.&lt;ref&gt;Kirsten Malmkjær, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IG7tE4-p-uUC The Linguistics Encyclopedia]'', 2nd ed, Routledge, 2002, {{ISBN|0-415-22210-9}}, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; This simple rank-vs.-frequency relationship was noted for an extraordinary variety of phenomena by [[George Kingsley Zipf]] (for example, see his ''The Psychobiology of Language''), and is known as [[Zipf's law]].

Although the Brown Corpus pioneered the field of corpus linguistics, by now typical corpora (such as the [[Corpus of Contemporary American English]], the [[British National Corpus]] or the [[International Corpus of English]]) tend to be much larger, on the order of 100 million words.

== Sample distribution ==

The Corpus consists of 500 samples, distributed across 15 genres in rough proportion to the amount published in 1961 in each of those genres. All works sampled were published in 1961; as far as could be determined they were ''first'' published then, and were written by native speakers of American English.

Each sample began at a random sentence-boundary in the article or other unit chosen, and continued up to the first sentence boundary after 2,000 words. In a very few cases miscounts led to samples being just under 2,000 words.

The original data entry was done on upper-case only [[keypunch]] machines; capitals were indicated by a preceding asterisk, and various special items such as formulae also had special codes.

The corpus originally (1961) contained 1,014,312 words sampled from 15 text categories:

** Political
** Sports
** Society
** Spot News
** Financial

Note that some versions of the tagged Brown corpus contain combined tags. For instance the word "wanna" is tagged VB+TO, since it is a contracted form of the two words, want/VB and to/TO. Also some tags might be negated, for instance "aren't" would be tagged "BER*", where * signifies the negation. Additionally, tags may have hyphenations: The tag -HL is hyphenated to the regular tags of words in headlines. The tag -TL is hyphenated to the regular tags of words in titles. The hyphenation -NC signifies an ''emphasized'' word. Sometimes the tag has a FW- prefix which means foreign word.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

'''Carrion''' (from [[Latin]] ''caro'', meaning "meat") is the decaying flesh of a dead animal.

==Overview==
Carrion is an important food source for large [[carnivore]]s and [[omnivore]]s in most ecosystems. Examples of carrion-eaters (or [[scavenger]]s) include [[vulture]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[eagle]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Hovenden, Frank. [http://www.comoxvalleynaturalist.bc.ca/wild_side/2003/vulture.html The Carrion Eaters] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601062448/http://www.comoxvalleynaturalist.bc.ca/wild_side/2003/vulture.html |date=1 June 2010 }}.

Many invertebrates such as the [[Silphidae|carrion and burying beetle]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John George Wood|title=Insects abroad: Being a popular account of foreign insects; their structure, habits and transformations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=10VHAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA82|accessdate=27 November 2011|year=1892|publisher=Longmans|pages=82–}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[maggot]]s of [[Calliphoridae|calliphorid flies]] and [[Flesh-fly|flesh-flies]] also eat carrion, playing an important role in recycling nitrogen and carbon in animal remains.

[[File:Flies settle on a sheep carrion.jpg|thumb|[[Fly|Flies]] settling on a [[sheep]] carrion]]
Carrion begins to decay the moment of the animal's death, and it will increasingly attract insects and breed [[bacteria]]. Not long after the animal has died, its body will begin to exude a foul odor caused by the presence of bacteria and the emission of [[cadaverine]] and [[putrescine]].

Some plants and [[fungus|fungi]] smell like [[Decomposition|decomposing]] carrion and attract insects that aid in reproduction. Plants that exhibit this behavior are known as [[carrion flower]]s. [[Phallaceae|Stinkhorn mushroom]]s are examples of fungi with this characteristic.
[[File:Coyoteelk.jpg|thumb|left|A [[mountain coyote|coyote]] feeding on elk carrion in [[Yellowstone National Park]]'s Lamar Valley during winter.]]
Sometimes carrion is used to describe an infected carcass that is diseased and should not be touched. An example of carrion being used to describe dead and rotting bodies in literature may be found in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' (III.i):&lt;ref&gt;[http://shakespeare.mit.edu/julius_caesar/julius_caesar.3.1.html The Life and Death of Julies Caesar]. SCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting above.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Cry 'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
With carrion men, groaning for burial.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another example can be found in Daniel Defoe's ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' when the title character kills an unknown bird for food but finds "its flesh was carrion, and fit for nothing".

==In Noahide law==
{{main|Noahide laws}}
The thirty-count laws of [[Ulla (Talmudist)]] include the prohibition of humans consuming carrion.&lt;ref&gt;talmud, hullin 92b&lt;/ref&gt; This count is in addition to the standard seven law count and has been recently{{when|date=September 2018}} published from the Judeo-Arabic writing of [[Shmuel ben Hophni Gaon]] after having been lost for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mossad HaRav Kook]] edition of Gaon's commentary to Genesis.&lt;/ref&gt;

This article gives some details of the various '''catalogues of classical compositions''' that have come into general use.

==Opus numbers==
While the [[opus number]]ing system has long been the standard manner in which individual compositions are identified and referenced, it is far from universal, and there have been many different applications of the system. Very few composers gave opus numbers to all of their published works without exception:
* Some composers used it for certain genres of music but not for others (for example, in [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s time, it was normal to apply opus numbers to instrumental compositions but not to vocal compositions such as operas, oratorios, etc.).
* Some composers gave opus numbers to some of their early compositions but abandoned the practice after some time (examples include [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] and [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]]).
* Some used it in a very erratic manner, or were subject to the wishes of their publishers, who for commercial reasons often presented works with opus numbers that bore little relationship to their place in the chronological sequence of the composer's works. In cases such as [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] and [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], one opus number could refer to a number of different works; or a single work could appear under different opus numbers.
* Some composers abandoned their early compositions and restarted the opus numbering sequence. Some did this more than once. For example, [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]] three times started numbering his works with opus numbers. He stopped the system in 1921 because of the difficulty of distinguishing between original works and ethnographic arrangements, and between major and minor works.
* A few composers allowed superstitious considerations to override chronological specificity in numbering: [[Jules Massenet|Massenet]], for this reason, published an "Opus 12B" but not an "Opus 13."{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

There are cases where works that a composer chose not to publish were published after their death and assigned very late opus numbers that often give a misleading idea of their order of composition (cases include [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]).

Other composers simply never used opus numbers at all (examples include [[Aaron Copland|Copland]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]] and many other 20th-century composers).

In some cases, the opus numbers that were established during the composer's lifetime are still used, but symbols from alternative comprehensive catalogues are used for unpublished works or works that have come to light since the composer's death.

==Comprehensive catalogues==
For the above and other reasons, musicologists have often found it necessary to produce comprehensive catalogues that incorporate the most up-to-date information available about the composers' works. These catalogues sometimes also include unpublished sketches, incomplete drafts, even doubtful works and those known to have been spuriously attributed, as well as writings and other non-musical output.

When such a catalogue finds general acceptance, the sequence numbers allocated by the author then become the standard way of referencing the composer's works, and these numbers usually supersede the opus numbers (if any) that were previously used.

Some such catalogues are organised in a single chronological sequence; others are divided into different genres and listed chronologically within each genre; others are alphabetically arranged. [[Thematic catalogue]] indicates a catalogue with a music example ([[incipit]]/theme) for each entry, usually represented on one or two staves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Erich Deutsch]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=SL3VXT875IQC ''The Schubert Thematic Catalogue.''] New York: [[Dover Publications]], 1995. {{ISBN|0486286851}} – {{ISBN|9780486286853}} pp. ix ff.&lt;/ref&gt; A symbol is chosen to represent the catalogue as a whole, and this is usually the initial of the author's or the composer's surname, or an abbreviation of the title of the catalogue itself. In a small number of cases, different symbols apply to different parts of the catalogue.

Among the most famous examples of this are:
* the '''[[BWV]]''' numbers allocated to [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s works in the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]] (Bach Works List) developed by [[Wolfgang Schmieder]]. They are also sometimes referred to by their '''S'''&amp;nbsp;numbers (after Schmieder)
* the '''K''' numbers allocated to [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s works in the [[Köchel catalogue]], created by [[Ludwig Ritter von Köchel]]. In Germany and other parts of Europe, the symbol used is '''KV''', for [[Köchel-Verzeichnis]] (Köchel List)
* the '''{{D.}}''' numbers allocated to [[Franz Schubert]]'s works in the [[Deutsch catalogue]], developed by [[Otto Erich Deutsch]]

In some cases, both the opus number ''and'' the newer catalogue designation are sometimes appended to a work. For example, Schubert's first set of [[Impromptus (Schubert)|Impromptus]] was published as Op. 90 and is now catalogued as {{D.|number=899}}, but concert programmes, CDs and reference works commonly refer to Schubert's "Impromptus, Op. 90, D. 899".

Some catalogues have appendixes ({{lang-de|Anhang}}, abbreviated as Anh.) for doubtful and/or spurious works, arrangements, etc.

==Thematic catalogue==
A '''thematic catalogue''' is an index used to identify musical compositions through the citation of the opening notes ([[incipit (music)|incipit]]) and/or main theme(s) of the work and/or of its movements or main sections.&lt;ref&gt;Grier, James, 'Thematic catalogue'. In ''The Oxford Companion to Music'' ([[Oxford University Press]])&lt;/ref&gt; Such catalogues can be used for many purposes, including as guides to a specific composer's works, as an inventory of a library's holding or as an advertisement of a publisher's output. In addition to the musical identification, a thematic catalogue may continue information such as dates of composition and first performance. Works within a thematic catalogue can be grouped chronologically or by genre.

Thematic catalogues produced as scholarly guides to the works of a particular composer provide a shorthand means of identification for their music. The [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]] (BWV) numbering system used for the works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] is one example.

==Multiple catalogues==
In a number of cases, more than one catalogue exists, or has existed, for the same composer's works. In most such cases, only one will be considered the current standard catalogue for the purposes of musicological indexing. For example, [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]'s works are now known only by S numbers, from the catalogue by [[Humphrey Searle]], which superseded that created by [[Peter Raabe]], which used R numbers.  Older catalogues are included for [[historiography|historiographic]] purposes.

But there are exceptions to this, such as:
* For [[Domenico Scarlatti]], the [[Alessandro Longo|Longo]] catalogue ('''L''' numbers) was in use from 1906, and although it has become generally superseded by the 1953 [[Ralph Kirkpatrick|Kirkpatrick]] catalogue ('''K''' or '''Kk''' numbers), L numbers are still seen in references. In 1967, [[Giorgio Pestelli|Pestelli]] created a third catalogue ('''P''' numbers), which has found acceptance in some places. Because all three symbols are often encountered, there is a [[List of solo keyboard sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti|concordance]] to help navigate between them.
*[[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s works can appear with an '''opus''' number, a '''WoO''' number, a '''Hess''' number or a '''Bia''' number (see [[Catalogues of Beethoven compositions]]). Until 1955, the opus numbers that appeared in the [[Beethoven Gesamtausgabe]] were used exclusively, but this edition omitted a large number of works. In 1955, Georg Kinsky and Hans Helm produced a listing of works that had not been given opus numbers, and gave them [[WoO (Beethoven)|WoO]] numbers (''Werke ohne Opuszahl'', or "Works without opus number"). This listing is often referred to as the Kinsky Catalogue. In 1957, [[Willy Hess (composer)|Willy Hess]] produced a new catalogue of Beethoven's unpublished works, which included all or most of the Kinsky Catalogue as well as other pieces; Hess numbers were allocated to this sequence of works. In 1968, Giovanni Biamonti produced the [[Biamonti Catalogue]], which sought to combine and update all pre-existing catalogues. Bia numbers relate to this catalogue.
** Note: The WoO symbol has also been used to classify some other composers' works that were not given opus numbers, such as certain works by [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]].
* In [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]]'s case, at least three latter-day catalogues vie for prominence: Maurice J. E. Brown ('''B''' numbers); [[Krystyna Kobylańska]] ('''KK''' numbers); and [[Józef Michał Chomiński]], whose catalogue is segmented into six parts, each part utilising a different letter ('''A, C, D, E, P''' and '''S'''). Hence, a work of Chopin can be referred to by its opus number and/or a catalogue number preceded by one of eight letter symbols.
* The cataloguing of [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]]'s works is similarly complex. Bartók assigned opus numbers to his works three times. He ended this practice with the Violin Sonata No. 1, Op. 21 in 1921, because of the difficulty of distinguishing between original works and ethnographic arrangements, and between major and minor works. Since his death, three attempts—two full and one partial—have been made at cataloguing. The first, and still most widely used, is [[András Szőllősy]]'s chronological '''Sz''' numbers, from 1 to 121. [[Denijs Dille]] subsequently reorganised the juvenilia (Sz. 1–25) thematically, as '''DD''' numbers 1 to 77. The most recent catalogue is that of [[László Somfai]]; this is a chronological index with works identified by '''BB''' numbers 1 to 129, incorporating corrections based on the Béla Bartók Thematic Catalogue.

==List of catalogues==

The following incomplete list gives details of many of the catalogues and symbols that have been used, and in many cases are still in use. It is in author or composer order, but can be sorted in symbol order.

| Terry; W
| 2nd edition with a new foreword by H.C. Robbins-Landon&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Bach's works are mostly referred to by the opus number assigned by the original publishers, which can cause misidentification because different, secondary publishers used the same (original) opus number (such as using Op. 18 to identify three different sets of J. C. Bach works). Moreover, three of six Op. 6 symphonies are identified as Op. 8, but in a different order. Because of this confusion, the ''de facto'' standard catalogue is '''''John Christian Bach''''', by C. S. Terry (2nd ed. 1967). When identifying a J. C. Bach work, one cites the page and incipit numbers "in Terry", although they are not catalogue numbers per se. A short list of the Terry numbers is in ''The New Grove Bach Family'', by Christoph Wolff, et al. (pp.&amp;nbsp;341ff., NY: Norton, 1983). Also used are the opus numbers of the "Thematic Catalog" in the ''Collected Works of Johann Christian Bach'' (Ernest Warburton, ed.; NY: Garland Publishing, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death, some more works were published in 1855 and 1857 as Opp. posth. 66–74. Yet more works were later published, but without opus numbers; some of these were known in Chopin's lifetime, while others have come to light only since his death. At least three major attempts have been made to catalogue all Chopin's works systematically, and each catalogue has its own numbering system. Maurice J. E. Brown uses B numbers, [[Krystyna Kobylańska]] uses KK numbers, and Józef Michał Chomiński allocates numbers to a variety of letters (A, C, D, E, P and S).

| K or KV
| Mozart's opus numbers are particularly scattered and useless and are no longer used at all (for instance, there are two sets of violin sonatas both called Op. 1). Köchel's '''''Chronologisch-thematisches Verzeichnis sämmtlicher Tonwerke W. A. Mozarts''''' was published in 1862 and has been substantially revised four times since then. KV numbers (short for Köchel-Verzeichnis) are often used for Mozart's works in Europe.

| See also TrV.&lt;ref name=RStrauss&gt;Strauss gave opus numbers to 88 compositions. Two volumes of a catalogue of the remaining works were published by Erich Hermann Mueller von Asow (1892–1964) in 1959. After von Asow's death, Franz Trenner (d. 1993) and Alfons Ott (d. 1976) published the third volume, based on von Asow's notes; this catalogue lists 323 titles, including Strauss's literary writings. The numbers for compositions from this catalogue have '''AV''' numbers. During the 15 years it took to publish von Asow's work, many new sources became available, so Trenner created a new chronological catalogue in 1985. An updated edition was published in 1993, and his son Florian Trenner published a completely revised edition in 1999; this catalogue lists 298 works and it uses '''TrV''' numbers.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1383">The '''Centre for Theoretical and Computational Chemistry''' (CTCC) was founded by the Norwegian Research Council in 2007. The duration of the project is ten years.  The CTCC is split in two units. One unit is located at the Department of Chemistry, [[University of Oslo]]
(Leader: Prof. [[Trygve Helgaker]]), the other part is based at the Department of Chemistry, 
[[University of Tromsø]] (Leader: Prof. [[Kenneth Ruud]]).  The CTCC is devoted to a wide range of research in the fields of theoretical and computational chemistry.  One main focus is on method development in electronic structure theory. The CTCC is a key contributor to the [[Dalton (program)]] electronic structure program system.  Another important topic of interest is the description of molecular dynamics with consideration
of quantum effects.  Applications of the electronic structure and molecular dynamics methods to chemical problems is another main occupation of researchers working at the CTCC.

The '''classical education movement''' advocates a form of education based in the traditions of [[Western culture]], with a particular focus on education as understood and taught in [[Classical antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]].  The curriculum and pedagogy of classical education was first developed during the Middle Ages by [[Martianus Capella]] and systematized during the Renaissance by [[Petrus Ramus]]. Capella's original goal was to provide a systematic, memorable framework to teach all human knowledge.  The term "classical education" has been used in Western culture for several centuries, with each era modifying the definition and adding its own selection of topics.  By the end of the 18th century, in addition to the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]] of the Middle Ages, the definition of a classical education embraced study of literature, poetry, drama, philosophy, history, art, and languages.&lt;ref name="EncycAmerEd1"&gt;{{citation

In the 20th and 21st centuries, it has been used to refer to a broad-based study of the [[liberal arts]] and sciences, as opposed to a practical or pre-professional program.&lt;ref name="EncycAmerEd1"/&gt;

There exist a number of informal groups and professional organizations which undertake the classical approach to classical education in earnest.  Within the secular classical movement, in the 1930s [[Mortimer Adler]] and [[Robert Hutchins]] set forth the "Great Books" of Western civilization as center stage for a classical education curriculum.  Also some public schools (primarily charters) have structured their curricula and pedagogy around the trivium and integrate the teaching of values (sometimes called "character education") into the mainstream classroom.  There are several major societies and associations within the [[classical Christian education]] movement, including the Society for Classical Learning, the [[Association of Classical and Christian Schools]], [http://trinityschools.org/ Trinity Schools], and the CiRCE Institute.

The University of Pennsylvania seal (1894) depicted the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] as a stack of books providing the foundation for a 'modified' quadrivium of mathematics, natural philosophy (empirical science), astronomy, and theology.
__TOC__

==Three Phases of Modern Education Linked to Classical Education==
Classical education developed many of the terms now used to describe modern education.  Western classical education has three phases, each with a different purpose.  The phases are roughly coordinated with [[developmental psychology|human development]], and would ideally be exactly coordinated with each individual student's development.

* "Primary education" teaches students how to learn.
* "Secondary education" then teaches a conceptual framework that can hold all human knowledge (history), fills in basic facts and practices of major fields of knowledge, and develops the fundamental skills (perhaps in a simplified form) of every major human activity.
* "Tertiary education" then prepares a person to pursue an educated profession such as law, theology, military strategy, medicine, or science.

=== Primary education ===
In classical terms, primary education was the ''[[Trivium (education)|trivium]]'' comprising grammar, logic, and rhetoric.

Logic and rhetoric were often taught in part by the [[Socratic method]], in which the teacher raises questions and the class discusses them.  By controlling the pace, the teacher can keep the class very lively, yet disciplined.

==== Grammar ====
Grammar consists of [[language]] skills such as reading and the mechanics of writing.  An important goal of grammar is to acquire as many words and manage as many concepts as possible so as to be able to express and understand clearly concepts of varying degrees of complexity.  Classical education traditionally included study of [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] to reinforce understanding the workings of languages and allow students to read the [[Classics]] of [[Western culture|Western Civilization]] untranslated.  In the modern renaissance of classical education, this period refers to the upper elementary school years.

==== Logic ====
[[Logic]] ([[dialectic]]) is the process of correct [[reasoning]].  The traditional text for teaching logic was [[Aristotle]]'s [[Aristotelian logic|Logic]].  In the modern renaissance of classical education, this logic stage (or dialectic stage) refers to the junior high or middle school aged student, who developmentally is beginning to question ideas and authority, and truly enjoys a debate or an argument.  Training in logic, both formal and informal, enables students to critically examine arguments and to analyze their own. The whole goal is to train the student's mind not only to grasp information, but to find the analytical connections between seemingly different facts/ideas, to find out why something is true, or why something else is false (in short, reasons for a fact).

==== Rhetoric ====
[[Rhetoric]]al debate and composition are taught to somewhat older (often high school aged) students, who by this point in their education have the concepts and logic to criticize their own work and persuade others.  According to [[Aristotle]] "Rhetoric is the counterpart of dialectic", concerned with finding "all the available means of persuasion."  The student now learns to articulate answers to important questions in his/her own words, to try to persuade others with these facts, and to defend ideas against rebuttal.  The student learns to reason correctly in the Logic stage so that they can now apply those skills to Rhetoric.  Traditionally, students would read and emulate classical poets in learning how to present their arguments well.

=== Secondary education ===
Secondary education, classically the ''[[quadrivium]]'' or "four ways," consist of [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], [[music]], and [[astronomy]].  Arithmetic is Number in itself, which is a pure abstraction; that is, outside of space and time.  Geometry is Number in space. Music is Number in time, and Astronomy is Number in space and time.&lt;ref name=EncycAmerEd1 /&gt;  Sometimes [[architecture]] was taught alongside these, often from the works of [[Vitruvius]].

History was always taught to provide a context and show political and military development.  The classic texts were from ancient authors such as [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]], [[Livy]], [[Cicero]], and [[Tacitus]].

Biographies were often assigned as well; the classic example being [[Plutarch]]'s ''Lives''.  Biographies help show how persons behave in their context, and the wide ranges of professions and options that exist.  As more modern texts became available, these were often added to the curriculum.

In the [[Middle Ages]], these were the best available texts.  In modern terms, these fields might be called [[history]], natural [[science]], [[accounting]] and [[business]], [[fine art]]s (at least two, one to amuse companions, and another to decorate one's domicile), [[military strategy]] and [[military tactics|tactics]], [[engineering]], [[agronomy]], and [[architecture]].

These are taught in a matrix of history, reviewing the natural development of each field for each phase of the trivium.  That is, in a perfect classical education, the historical study is reviewed three times: first to learn the grammar (the concepts, terms and skills in the order developed), next time the logic (how these elements could be assembled), and finally the rhetoric, how to produce good, humanly useful and beautiful objects that satisfy the grammar and logic of the field.

History is the unifying conceptual framework, because history is the study of everything that has occurred before the present.  A skillful teacher also uses the historical context to show how each stage of development naturally poses questions and then how advances answer them, helping to understand human motives and activity in each field.  The question-answer approach is called the "dialectic method," and permits history to be taught Socratically as well.

Classical educators consider the [[Socrates|Socratic]] method to be the best technique for teaching critical thinking.  In-class discussion and critiques are essential in order for students to recognize and internalize critical thinking techniques.  This method is widely used to teach both [[philosophy]] and [[law]].  It is currently rare in other contexts.  Basically, the teacher referees the students' discussions, asks leading questions, and may refer to facts, but never gives a conclusion until at least one student reaches that conclusion.  The learning is most effective when the students compete strongly, even viciously in the argument, but always according to well-accepted rules of correct reasoning.  That is, [[fallacy|fallacies]] should not be allowed by the teacher.

By completing a project in each major field of human effort, the student can develop a personal preference for further education and professional training.

=== Tertiary education ===
Tertiary education was usually an [[apprentice]]ship to a person with the desired profession.  Most often, the understudy was called a "secretary" and had the duty of carrying on all the normal business of the "master." [[Philosophy]] and [[Theology]] were both widely taught as tertiary subjects in Universities, however.

The early biographies of nobles show probably the ultimate form of classical education: a tutor.  One early, much-emulated classic example is of this tutor system is of [[Alexander the Great]], who was tutored by [[Aristotle]].

== Modern interpretations of classical education ==
There exist a number of modern groups and professional organizations which take the classical approach to education seriously, and who undertake it in earnest.

===Classical Christian education===
{{main|Classical Christian education}}
There are several major societies and associations within the [[classical Christian education]] movement, including the Society for Classical Learning, the [[Association of Classical and Christian Schools]], [http://trinityschools.org/ Trinity Schools], the [[Classic Learning Test]], and the CiRCE Institute. 

These schools tend to rely for upon one or more of the visions of classical education represented by [[Dorothy Sayers]] essay "The Lost Tools of Learning",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Sayers, Dorothy  |title=The Lost Tools of Learning |url=http://www.cambridgestudycenter.com/artilces/Sayers1.htm |date=presented at Oxford in 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortimer Adler's [[Paideia Proposal]], Alfred North Whitehead's ''The Aims of Education,'' or Susan Wise Bauer's ''[https://welltrainedmind.com/ The Well Trained Mind]''.

Most classical Christian schools employ the trivium as three stages of learning which are linked to child development:

* Grammar: The fundamental rules of each subject
* Logic: The ordered relationship of particulars in each subject 
* Rhetoric: How the grammar and logic of each subject may be clearly expressed 

Classical Christian schools vary in their approach to the sectarian integration of Christian thinking. Some schools ask parents to sign a statement of faith before attending, some do not require this of parents but are clear in their sectarian teaching, others are consciously ecumenical. In the 1970s, as a response to the campus riots and sexual revolution of the 1960s, many small classical Catholic colleges began to incorporate, e.g. the [[Thomas More College of Liberal Arts]] in Merrimack, [[New Hampshire]] (est. 1978), [[Thomas Aquinas College]] in Sao Paulo, California, and [[Christendom College]] in Front Royal, Virginia. 

===Classical secular education===
There exist a number of classical schools in the public/secular sector.  These schools, primarily charter schools, also structure their curricula and pedagogy around the trivium and integrate the teaching of values (sometimes called "character education") into the mainstream classroom without involving any particular religious perspectives.

Methods of classical education have also often been integrated into [[homeschooling]], particularly due to the publication of:
"The Well-Trained Mind: A Guide to Classical Education at Home," by Jessie Wise and [[Susan Wise Bauer]] (W.W. Norton, 1999), is a modern reference on classical education, particularly in a homeschool setting. It provides a history of classical education, an overview of the methodology and philosophy of classical education, and annotated lists of books divided by grade and topic that list the best books for classical education in each category.

[[Mortimer Adler]] and [[Robert Hutchins]], both of the [[University of Chicago]] set forth in the 1930s to restore the "Great Books" of Western civilization to center stage in the curriculum. [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] is an example of this type of classical education at the college level.  Although the standard classical works&amp;mdash;such as the [[Harvard Classics]]&amp;mdash;most widely available at the time, were decried by many as out of touch with modern times, Adler and Hutchins sought to expand on the standard "classics" by including more modern works, and by trying to tie them together in the context of what they described as the "Great Ideas," condensed into a "Syntopicon" index and bundled together with a new "five foot shelf" of books as "The [[Great Books of the Western World]]." They were wildly popular during the 1950s, and discussion groups of aficionados were found all over the USA, but their popularity waned during the 1960s, and such groups are relatively hard to find today.  Extensions to the original set are still being published, encompassing selections from both current and older works which extend the "great ideas" into the present age and other fields, including civil rights, the global environment, and discussions of multiculturalism and assimilation.

==Classical Languages==
A more traditional, but less common view of classical education arises from the ideology of the Renaissance, advocating an education grounded in the languages and literatures of Greece and Rome. The demanding and lengthy training period required for learning to read Greek and Latin texts in their original form has been crowded out in most American schools in favor of more contemporary subjects.

The revival of "Classical Education" has resulted in Latin being taught at Classical Schools, but less often Greek.  It is worth noting that the [[Association of Classical and Christian Schools]] does require Latin for accreditation, and [[New Saint Andrews College]] requires both Latin and Greek to graduate with a 4-year degree.  A new group of schools, the [http://www.classicallatin.org Classical Latin School Association], does require Latin to be taught as a core subject.

Such an approach—an education in the [[classics]]—differs from the usual approach of the Classical education movement, but is akin to an education on "The Great Books" followed by [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]].

==Parallels in the East==
In India, the classical education system is based upon the study and understanding of the ancient texts the [[Vedas]], a discipline called [[Vedanga]], and subjects based upon that foundation, referred to as [[Upaveda]] and incorporating medicine ([[Ayurveda]]), music, [[archery]] and other [[martial arts]].

Similarly, in China, the fulcrum of a classical education was the study and understanding of a core canon, the [[Four Books and Five Classics]].

In Taiwan, Classical Chinese takes up 35% of Chinese education in junior high school (7-9th grade, compulsory), and 65% in senior high school (10-12th grade).

In it, he argues that the scope of the classical [[liberal education]] is inadequate for today's society, and that people should also be conversant with the basic facts of science and technology, since they now form a much more important part of our lives than did the tertiary studies of antiquity. He argues for a new synthesis of science, engineering, and the humanities in which there is a balance between what ''can'' be done and what ''ought'' to be done, between human desires and earthly consequences, and between our ever-increasing power to affect our surroundings and the ever-present danger of destroying the ecological and environmental systems which allow us to exist.

'''Conservation and restoration of metals''' is the activity devoted to the protection and [[Historic preservation|preservation]] of historical (religious, artistic, technical and ethnographic) and [[archaeological]] objects made partly or entirely of [[metal]]. In it are included all activities aimed at preventing or slowing deterioration of items, as well as improving accessibility and readability of them as objects of [[cultural heritage]]. Despite the fact that metals are generally considered as the relatively permanent and stable materials, in contact with the environment they deteriorate gradually, some faster and some much slower. This applies especially to archaeological finds.

It is very important that a conservator of metals has [[knowledge]] of basic [[metalworking]] techniques, history of metalwork, [[history of art]], [[archaeology]], [[corrosion]] of metals, [[scientific]] [[research]] methods, [[theory]] and [[ethics]] of conservation-restoration.

==Deterioration of metals==
[[File:PerseusSignoriaStatue.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Perseus with the Head of Medusa]]'' in the Loggia dei Lanzi gallery on the edge of the [[Piazza della Signoria]] in Florence; picture taken after the statue's cleaning and restoration.]]
An essential cause of deterioration is corrosion of metal objects or object deterioration by interaction with the environment. As the most influential factors of deterioration of historical objects should be pointed out as the relative humidity and air pollution while in archaeological objects a crucial role has composition, depth, humidity and amount of gasses in the soil. In cases of marine or fresh water finds the most important factors of decay are the amount and composition of soluble salts, water depth, amount of dissolved gases, the direction of water currents and the role of both microscopic and macroscopic living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;

==Deterioration of materials associated with metals==
Associated materials deteriorate depending on the origin whether they are organic or inorganic materials. Organic materials usually fail in a relatively short period of time, primarily due to biodegradation. With inorganic materials are these processes considerably longer and more complex. Amount of gases, humidity, depth and composition of soil are very important. In case of salty and sweet water finds essential are amount of gases dissolved in water, depth of water, direction of currents, and microscopic and macroscopic living organisms.

==Metals conservation planning==

===Basics===
As with the conservation and restoration works on any other material,  here are the basic tenets of conservation-restoration based on the quality of execution and the best possible preservation of cultural, historical and technological identity and integrity of objects. Minimal intervention, reversibility and repeatability of preferred treatment are essential, as well as the possibility of easy identification of restored parts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elsevierdirect.com/brochures/shreir/PDF/Shreirs_PreservationOfMetallicCulturalHeritage.pdf Accessed 16.01.2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently non-toxic nature of used materials and procedures becomes important too, both in relation to objects and conservator-restorer as a performer, but also in relation to the environment.

===Research===
Nowadays scientific research is an integral part of the metals conservation treatment, at least in highly developed countries.

====Identification of metals and alloys====
*Simple methods - visual examination, spot tests, specific gravity
*Scientific methods - [[X-ray fluorescence]], [[X-ray Diffraction|XRD]], [[Particle-induced X-ray emission]], [[LIBS]], [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]], electrochemical techniques, [[metallography]]

====Identification of corrosion processes and products====
*Simple method - visual examination, spot tests
*[[Oddy test|The Oddy test]] - for copper, silver, and lead
*Scientific methods - xrd, SEM, metallography

====Identification of materials associated with metals====
*Simple methods - visual examination, spot tests, specific gravity
*Scientific methods - xrf, [[chromatography]],
Raman spectroscopy

====Identification of technology used to produce objects====
*Simple methods - visual examination
*Scientific methods - metallography, [[x-ray radiography]], [[x-ray computed tomography]]

===Decision making===
In preparing the strategy of the metals conservation project interdisciplinary approach to the same is essential. It implies the participation of as many experts as is possible, as a minimum,  we can take curator (archaeologist, historian, art historian), scientists specialized for corrosion of metallic objects of cultural heritage and the conservator - restorer.

===Documentation===
Systematic and well-managed documentation is today an essential prerequisite for quality executed conservation and restoration treatments, including documentation of the state of objects before, during and after treatment. Identification of materials and procedures used to produce object and the results of any scientific research must be part of documentation too. Last but not least- an integral part of the documentation must be a recommendation for further care of object.

===Ethics and ethical problems in metals conservation===
The ethical concept of conservation of metal objects in principle is the same as those in other fields of conservation-restoration of cultural heritage.

But there are several specific problems that can only be found in the conservation of metals - problem of heat treatment of archaeological objects, and the problem of radical restoration of historic, mostly technical, but also architectonic objects too.

While in the first case problem is primarily in the destruction of valuable scientific data, in case of the technical, the architectural, and somewhat less often, historical objects problem is that a radically restored items just simulate the original appearance of the object, and so in some ways that objects can be considered even as, more or less successful fakes, which only superficially simulate long-lost or never existing state of object.

According to the above-mentioned, whenever it is possible real historical substance must be preserved. Thoroughly documented and technically professionally executed restoration of objects, must be avoided because such objects must be seen only as freshly painted surrogates of authentic historic substance.

Ethical problems connected with conservation of sacred metallic heritage objects can be included too.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J.C.: On restoring sacred objects http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/thompson/sacred/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==

===Preventive conservation===
{{main article|Collections care}}
Metallic heritage objects are sensitive to environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, air pollution and exposure to light and ultraviolet light. They must be protected in a controlled environment where such variables are maintained within a range of damage-limiting levels.

Preventive conservation, also known as collections care, is an important element of museum policy. It is an essential responsibility of members of the museum profession to create and maintain a protective environment for the collections in their care, whether in store, on display, or in transit. A museum should carefully monitor the condition of collections to determine when an artifact requires conservation work and the services of a qualified conservator.

===Interventive conservation===

====Cleaning====
[[Image:HorsesSaintMark1.jpg|right|thumb|Conservation of gilt bronze [[Horses of Saint Mark]], ([[Venice]]).]]

The most common procedure in conservation and restoration of metals is the cleaning process.  This process can be distinguish between mechanical, chemical, electrochemical, ultrasonic, plasma and laser cleaning. In principle, it is aimed at removing dirt and corrosion products from the surface of a metal object.  In many cases archaeology objects only can be cleaned mechanically.

====Reconstruction of missing parts or surface decoration====
In certain cases, metals conservator must re-create the lost parts of objects or restore original surface decoration. This approach is accurate only if we have an exact documentation or photographs of items in a complete, currently non-existent state that we want to return.

New parts must be clearly and visibly marked and at least they must be minimally different from the original historic material.

If needed, those parts must be easily and completely removable from the object, and with methods which will not harm it.

Only cyanide or hexchromate free processes must be used.

Only worn-out spots can be replated.

Replating of entire object must be avoided.

====Stabilization====
Focused on slowing of deterioration of objects – in the case of archaeology objects the thorough removal or blocking of chloride salts. In case of the historical objects it is focused on the use of corrosion inhibitors, conversion coatings, rust converters or eventually oxygen free storage.
*Chloride removal (chemical processes, electrochemical processes)
*Corrosion inhibitors ([[benzotriazole]], [[tannin]])
*[[Rust converter]]s˙
*[[Conversion coating]]s ([[phosphate conversion coating]]s, phosphate/tannin, etc.)
*Oxygen free storage

*Waxes:
'''Renaissance Wax{{main article|Renaissance Wax}}

is a brand of microcrystalline wax polish that is widely encountered in antique restoration and museum curation. Although not appropriate for all materials, it is known to and used by almost every collection. It is also used as a primary finish for cabinetry and furniture. Renaissance wax is also used by reenactors of historic swordsmanship to protect armour and weapons. It is widely recognised that this substance is more protective and longer lasting than oil, especially for swords and helmets that are frequently touched by human hands.

To quote a typical commercial supplier of conservation materials, it is used, to revive and protect valuable furniture, leather, paintings, metals, marble, onyx, ivory etc. Freshens colours and imparts a soft sheen&lt;ref&gt;http://www.picreator.co.uk/articles/3_renaissance_wax.htm{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cosmolloid 80 H'''

is refined white microcrystalline wax. It can be used on historical and archaeological metals. Melting point 60–94&amp;nbsp;°C. Soluble in benzol, ether, chloroform, [[carbon disulfide]], [[carbon tetrachloride]], [[turpentine]], petroleum distillates, and fixed oils; partially soluble in [[acetone]], [[diacetone alcohol]]. Main ingredient in Renaissance Wax.

===Conservation of materials associated with metals===

====Precious and semi precious stones====
In principle do not use any solvent, but only distilled water, or a 10% solution of soapwort plant (''Saponaria officinalis''). You must be Especially careful when working on porous gemstones like [[malachite]], [[opal]], [[chalcedony]], [[chrysoprase]], [[agate]], [[carnelian]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[jade]] and [[turquoise]]. Special attention requires gemstones combined with colored metal foils, in this case, the liquid does not come into contact with the foil. Do not use ultrasonic cleaning.

====Enamels====
{{Main article|Conservation and restoration of glass objects}}

====Niello====
Nielloed items can be cleaned only mechanically, never try to use chemical cleaning. Black pigment mixed with Paraloid B 72 can be used for reconstruction of missing parts.
Concentrated solution of Paraloid B 72 or B 67 (soluble in white spirit) can be used as reversible glue.

====Amber====
Do not clean with solvents, do not use ultrasound, you can use only distilled water, or a mixture of water and ethanol (add up to 0.5% crosslinker).&lt;ref&gt;Nikitin, MK; Meljnikova, EP Himija v restavracii, Leningrad 1990th str.268&lt;/ref&gt; Variety of waxy resin mixtures can be used as glue, depending on the color of amber. You can use 10% solution of Canada balsam in toluene&lt;ref&gt;Huck, J; Bleck, RD Chemikalien und Rezepte, Weimar 1990th&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological material can be cleaned only mechanically.
Soaking in liquid paraffin can be used to consolidate and improve color of amber.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ingolstadt.de/stadtmuseum/scheuerer/ausstell/bernst04.htm archaeological site access 23.03.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to one Korean article for consolidation can be used Paraloid B 67 dissolved in xylene (proved more stable than white spirit, usual solvent for B 67)&lt;ref&gt;Ham, CH, Shin, B. Amber Artifact Consolidation Case Study: Impact of Organic Solvents on Amber Artifacts, Abstracts from the 37th Annual Conference of the Canadian Association for Conservation of Cultural Property, Winnipeg 2011th&lt;/ref&gt; According to one American article as ideal consolidant and adhesive can be used Regalrez 1126&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276594058_Conservation_of_amber_at_the_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_New_York_USA_Regalrez_R_1126_as_a_consolidant_and_adhesive_for_amber_and_copal  Accessed 15.11.2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Artifacts must be Protected from strong light and high temperatures, low humidity and oscillations in humidity, in the case of metal/amber objects do not to use corrosion inhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cr.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-17.pdf Access to the site Aus Bruchstücken rekonstruiert Ein Bernsteinkästchen der Gothaer Kunstkammer&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oriental lacquer - urushi====
{{Main article|Conservation and restoration of lacquerware}}

Requires a completely different approach than western lacquers. May be found on the Japanese arms and armour. The best approach – leave it to expert for oriental lacquer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/urushi.html Accessed 10/02/2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic37-01-009_indx.html Accessed 2.10.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http: / / art-con.ru/node/651. Accessed 04.12.2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Mixture of 6-8% polyvinyl alcohol and chalk can be used as filling material(Rhoplex WS 24 can be used too).&lt;ref&gt;http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic37-01-009_2.html Accessed 18.11.2012 page.&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese conservators use traditional techniques, but as Urushi causes allergic reactions, these methods are not recommended. Clean it with an aliphatic hydrocarbon such as white or mineral spirits. Distilled water or saliva (moistened cottonwool swabs) can caused discoloration and should be avoided by the inexperienced: pH is crucial. Keep objects in rooms with controlled humidity and temperature, preferably about 50% RH, and protect them from UV radiation.

====Coral====
Can be cleaned with cotton wool swabs soaked in distilled water, or with a mixture of distilled water and ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;Nikitin, M.K.; Melynikova, E.P. Himiya v restavracii, Leningrad 1990., p.272.&lt;/ref&gt;
Do not use ultrasound. Avoid any contact with acids.

====Pearls====
Historical objects can be cleaned using a mixture of 70% ethanol and 30% weak ammonia water (1%). To remove the surface layer that has lost luster you can use 3–5% EDTA, after that step rinse with distilled water, and then with 80% ethanol, then with 90% ethanol, and finally with pure ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;Nikitin, M.K.; Melynikova, E.P. Himiya v restavracii, Leningrad 1990., p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;
Do not use ultrasound.
Archaeological finds must be treated as soon as possible, preferably after excavation, you can clean them only mechanically, then consolidate with 2% Paraloid B 72, in the case of dry findings (first saturate with solvent in which it is dissolved), in case of damp or wet findings use Rhoplex WS 24 (acrylic dispersion).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/reports/shell_objects.pdf Accessed 17.10.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
Somewhat More recent Russian literature recommends use of bleached beeswax dissolved in white spirit or medical benzine as protective coating. Fish glue mixed with water and alcohol (7/3), with addition of 1% katamine AB as biocide can be used as glue. Nonionogenic detergent 2-3% in a mixture of water and alcohol can be used for cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;http://art-con.ru/node/4473 Accessed 29.11.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
Avoid prolonged contact with water, sudden changes in temperature and relative humidity, including strong light or contact with acidic or alkaline solutions (soap water too).

====Mother of pearl====

====Ivory, bone and antler====
{{Main article|Conservation and restoration of ivory objects}}

====Tortoiseshell====

====Jet====
You can clean it with cottonwool swabs soaked in distilled water or soapwort extract (''Saponaria officinalis'', 100 grams of dried root per 1 liter of boiling water). Archaeological material can be cleaned only mechanically. Wax/resin mixtures or concentrated solution of Paraloid B 72 (or B 67) can be 
used as glue for archaeology objects.&lt;ref&gt;Nikitin, M.K.; Melynikova, E.P. Himiya v restavracii, Leningrad 1990., p.269&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage of metallic heritage objects==
The items should be stored in rooms that are protected from polluted air, dust, ultraviolet radiation, and excessive relative humidity - ideal values are temperature of 16-20&amp;nbsp;°C and up to 40% (35-55% according to recent Canadian Conservation Institute recommendations) relative humidity, noting that if metal is combined with organic materials, relative humidity should not be below 45%. Archaeological objects must be stored in rooms (or plastic boxes) with very low relative humidity, or in the case of particularly valuable items in the chambers with nitrogen or argon. Copper or copper alloy objects with active corrosion up to 35% RH. Iron objects with active corrosion 12-15% RH. Shelves in the storerooms must be of stainless steel or chlorine and acetate free plastic or powder coated steel. Wood and wood-based products ([[Particle board]], [[plywood]]) must be avoided. Also do not use [[rubber]], [[felt]] or [[wool]]. When you are handling metal objects, always wear clean cotton gloves. Lighting levels must be kept below 300 lux (up to 150 lux in case of lacquered or painted objects, up to 50 lux in case of objects with light sensitive materials)&lt;ref&gt;Budija Goran:Čišćenje, zaštita i održavanje umjetničkih predmeta i starina od metala, version December 2010., Zagreb,

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2214">'''Contact''' is an annual interdisciplinary conference that brings together [http://www.contact-conference.com/archive/org.html renowned social and space scientists, science fiction writers and artists] to exchange ideas, stimulate new perspectives, and encourage serious, creative speculation about humanity's future. The intent of Contact is to promote the integration of [[human factor]]s into space research and policy, to explore the intersection of science and art, and to develop ethical approaches to [[extraterrestrial intelligence|cross-cultural contact]]. Since its beginnings, the Contact conference has fostered interdisciplinary inquiries into art, literature, exploration and scientific investigation.

Contact was conceived by anthropologist Jim Funaro in 1979, and the first formal conference was held in 1983 in [[Santa Cruz, California]]. Twenty-six annual events have followed and several held at [[NASA Ames Research Center]]. In many previous years, the COTI HI project involved teams of high school students in the creation of scientifically accurate extraterrestrial beings, and in simulated encounters between two such races. 

Many spin-off organizations have formed, on line, and as far away as Japan. One such organization is the [[Contact consortium]], which is focused on the medium of contact in multi-user [[virtual world]]s on the [[Internet]].  

Contact has been closely allied with the [[SETI Institute]], and its early participants created the hypothetical planet Epona.

The 27th  Contact conference was held on March 31 - April 2, 2012 at the [[SETI Institute]] and the Domain Hotel, in [[Sunnyvale, California]]. Beginning with the 28th conference, held in Mountain View, the organization adopted a biennial schedule. The 29th conference was held on April 1st-3rd, 2016, at the Domain Hotel, California.

'''Conversion theory''' is [[Serge Moscovici]]'s conceptual analysis of the cognitive and interpersonal processes that mediate the direct and indirect impact of a consistent minority on the majority (Moscovici, 1976). Initially, Moscovici's conversion theory of [[minority influence]] began as a minority opinion that was rejected by many researchers, but eventually members of opposition validated it, thus confirming the theory's exact predictions. Asch's studies highlighted the power that majorities have over groups and their subsequent conformity, but Moscovici was more interested in the power exerted by minorities.

Contrasting the "majority rules" model of social influence, conversion theory maintains that disagreement within the group results in conflict, and that group members are motivated to reduce that conflict—either by changing their own opinions or attempting to get others to change. Minorities have a different process of influence, and Moscovici theorized that they do so by a ''validation process'' (majorities undergo comparison processes). If someone within the minority breaks that unanimity of the majority, this captures the majority's attention, causing them to consider their arguments and reasoning for disagreement (Moscovici, 1976). If the new information/opinions garnered from the minority are validated, this may sway the majority and lead to more long lasting changes than changes occurring via comparison processes.  This is because validation leads to private acceptance, whereas comparison processes result in direct influence as members publicly comply.{{cn|date=August 2015}} Generally, validation is a long process, so the effects of a minority are somewhat slower to emerge and identify.

One of the first tests of this theory was a reversal of [[Asch conformity experiments]] by adding two confederates in a six person group, and arranging for them to systematically disagree with the majority decision. Instead of lines, the participants judged (aloud) the color and brightness of a series of 36 colored slides (all were blue with varying luminosity). The confederates were told to consistently state "green" rather than "blue." When tested alone, the error rate of participants was 0.25% (i.e., saying green when the answer was blue), but when tested in the presence of the green-saying confederates, the error rate increased to 8.4%, thus confirming the power of a minority (Forsyth, 2010).

In [[physical cosmology]], '''cosmological perturbation theory''' is the theory by which the ''evolution of structure'' is understood in the [[big bang]] model. It uses [[general relativity]] to compute the gravitational forces causing small perturbations to grow and eventually seed the formation of [[star formation|star]]s, [[quasar]]s, [[galaxy formation|galaxies]] and [[cluster of galaxies|cluster]]s. It only applies to situations in which the universe is predominantly homogeneous, such as during [[cosmic inflation]] and large parts of the big bang. The universe is believed to still be homogeneous enough that the theory is a good approximation on the largest scales, but on smaller scales more involved techniques, such as [[N-body simulation]]s, must be used.

Because of the [[gauge invariance]] of [[general relativity]], the correct formulation of cosmological perturbation theory is subtle. There are currently two distinct approaches to perturbation theory in classical general relativity:

* ''gauge-invariant perturbation theory'' based on foliating a space-time with hyper-surfaces, and
* ''1+3 covariant gauge-invariant perturbation theory'' based on threading a space-time with frames.

== Gauge-invariant perturbation theory ==

The gauge-invariant perturbation theory is based on developments by Bardeen (1980),&lt;ref&gt;Bardeen J (1980) Phys. Rev. D, 22, 1882&lt;/ref&gt; Kodama and Sasaki (1984)&lt;ref&gt;Kodama H,  Sasaki M, (1984) Prog. Theor. Phys. Supplement, 78, 1-166
&lt;/ref&gt;  building on the work of Lifshitz (1946).&lt;ref&gt;Lifshitz E M (1946) J. Phys. (USSR), 10, 116&lt;/ref&gt; This is the standard approach to perturbation theory of general relativity for cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;Mukhanov, V. F., and Feldman, H. A., and Brandenberger, R. H.: "Theory of Cosmological Perturbations", Physics Reports (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is widely used for the computation of anisotropies in the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]&lt;ref name = "Husugi"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hu W, Sugiyama N | title = Toward Understanding CMB Anisotropies and Their Implications | journal = Phys. Rev. D | volume = 51 | year = 1995 | arxiv = astro-ph/9411008 | pages = 2599 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.51.2599 |bibcode = 1995PhRvD..51.2599H | issue = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[physical cosmology]] program and focuses on predictions arising from linearisations that preserve gauge invariance with respect to Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) models. This approach draws heavily on the use of [[Newtonianism|Newtonian]] like analogue and usually has as it starting point the FRW background around which perturbations are developed. The approach is '''non-local and coordinate dependent but gauge invariant''' as the resulting linear framework is built from a specified family of background hyper-surfaces which are linked by gauge preserving mappings to foliate the space-time. Although intuitive this approach does not deal well with the nonlinearities natural to general relativity.

== 1+3 covariant gauge-invariant perturbation theory ==

In [[relativistic cosmology]] using the Lagrangian threading dynamics of Ehlers (1971)&lt;ref&gt;Ehlers J (1971) General Relativity and Cosmology (Varenna), R K Sachs (Academic Press NY)&lt;/ref&gt; and Ellis (1971)&lt;ref&gt;Ellis G F R, (1971) General Relativity and Cosmology(Varenna), R K Sachs (Academic Press NY)&lt;/ref&gt; it is usual to use the gauge-invariant covariant perturbation theory developed by Hawking (1966)&lt;ref&gt;Hawking S W (1966) ApJ. 145, 44&lt;/ref&gt; and Ellis and Bruni (1989).&lt;ref&gt;Ellis G F R, Bruni M (1989) Phys. Rev. D, 40, 6, 1804&lt;/ref&gt; Here rather than starting with a background and perturbing away from that background one starts with full [[general relativity]] and systematically reduces the theory down to one that is linear around a particular background.&lt;ref&gt;Tsagas C G, Challinor A, Maartens R (2008) Physics Reports 465  61-147&lt;/ref&gt; The approach is '''local and both covariant as well as gauge invariant''' but can be non-linear because the approach is built around the local [[comoving observer]] frame (see [[frame bundle]]) which is used to thread the entire space-time. This approach to perturbation theory produces differential equations that are of just the right order needed to describe the true physical degrees of freedom and as such no non-physical gauge modes exist. It is usual to express the theory in a coordinate free manner. For applications of [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]], because one is required to use the full [[tangent bundle]], it becomes convenient to use the [[Tetrad (general relativity)|tetrad]] formulation of relativistic cosmology. The application of this approach to the computation of anisotropies in [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]&lt;ref name="maartens"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Maartens R, Gebbie T, Ellis GF| title = Cosmic microwave background anisotropies: Nonlinear dynamics| journal = Phys. Rev. D | volume = 59 | year=1999 | pages = 083506|arxiv=astro-ph/9808163|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevD.59.083506 |bibcode = 1999PhRvD..59h3506M |issue= 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; requires the linearization of the full [[relativistic kinetic theory]] developed by Thorne (1980)&lt;ref&gt;Thorne K S (1980) Rev. Mod. Phys., 52, 299&lt;/ref&gt; and Ellis, Matravers and Treciokas (1983).&lt;ref&gt;Ellis G F R, Treciokas R, Matravers D R, (1983) Ann. Phys., 150, 487&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gauge freedom and frame fixing ==

In relativistic cosmology there is a freedom associated with the choice of threading frame, this frame choice is distinct from choice associated with coordinates. Picking this frame is equivalent to fixing the choice of timelike world lines mapped into each other, this reduces the [[gauge freedom]] it does not fix the gauge but the theory remains gauge invariant under the remaining gauge freedoms. In order to fix the gauge a specification of correspondences between the time surfaces in the real universe (perturbed) and the background universe are required along with the correspondences between points on the initial spacelike surfaces in the background and in the real universe. This is the link between the gauge-invariant perturbation theory and the gauge-invariant covariant perturbation theory. Gauge invariance is only guaranteed if the choice of frame coincides exactly with that of the background; usually this is trivial to ensure because physical frames have this property.

== Newtonian-like equations ==

Newtonian-like equations emerge from perturbative general relativity with the choice of the [[Newtonian gauge]]; the Newtonian gauge provides the direct link between the variables typically used in the gauge-invariant perturbation theory and those arising from the more general gauge-invariant covariant perturbation theory.

The '''Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics''' is an [[economic]] [[research institute]] at [[Yale University]]. It was founded in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] in 1932 by [[Alfred Cowles]], a businessman and economist, as the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics. In 1939, the Cowles Commission moved to the [[University of Chicago]] under the directorship of [[Theodore O. Yntema]]. [[Jacob Marschak]] took over as director in 1943 until 1948, when it was passed over to [[Tjalling C. Koopmans]]. Rising hostile opposition to the Cowles Commission by the department of economics at University of Chicago during the 1950s led Koopmans to convince the Cowles family to move it to [[Yale University]] in 1955 (where it was renamed the Cowles Foundation).{{ref|newschool}}

As its motto (''Theory and Measurement'') indicates, the Cowles Commission was dedicated to the pursuit of linking [[economic theory]] to mathematics and statistics. Its main contributions to economics lie in its creation and consolidation of two important fields: [[general equilibrium theory]] and [[econometrics]].

The thrust of the Cowles approach was a specific, probabilistic framework in estimating [[simultaneous equations]] to model an economy.  Its ultimate goal in doing so was to gain [[economic policy|policy]] insight.  The Cowles approach structured its models from a priori economic theory.  One of its main contributions was in exposing the [[estimator bias|bias]] of [[ordinary least squares]] regression in [[parameter identification problem|identifying]] coefficient estimates.  Consequently, Cowles researchers developed new methods such as the [[indirect least squares]], [[instrumental variable]] methods, the full information [[maximum likelihood]] method, and the limited information maximum likelihood method.  All of these methods used theoretical, a priori restrictions. According to an article by Carl F. Christ, the Cowles approach was grounded on the following assumptions: 1, simultaneous economic behavior; 2, linear or logarithmic equations and disturbances; 3, systematic, observable variables without error; 4, discrete variable changes as opposed to continuous; 5, a priori determination of [[exogeny|exogeneity]] and [[endogeneity (econometrics)|endogeneity]]; 6, the existence of a [[reduced form]]; 7, independence of the [[explanatory variable]]s; 8, a priori identified [[structural equation]]s; 9, [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] disturbances with zero means, finite and constant [[covariance]]s, a [[nonsingular]] [[covariance matrix]], and [[serial correlation|serial independence]]; 10, a [[Lyapunov stability|dynamically stable]] system of equations.{{ref|Christ}}

Several Cowles associates have won [[Nobel prize]]s for research done while at the Cowles Commission. These include [[Tjalling Koopmans]], [[Kenneth Arrow]], [[Gérard Debreu]], [[James Tobin]], [[Franco Modigliani]], [[Herbert A. Simon]], [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]], [[Lawrence Klein]], [[Trygve Haavelmo]], [[Leonid Hurwicz]] and [[Harry Markowitz]].

The Cowles Foundation is located at 30 [[Hillhouse Avenue]], [[New Haven, Connecticut]].

'''Depression glass''' is clear or colored translucent machine made glassware that was distributed free, or at low cost, in the United States and Canada around the time of the [[Great Depression]]. 

==History==
Much depression glass is [[uranium glass]]. The [[Quaker Oats Company]], and other food manufacturers and distributors, put a piece of glassware in boxes of food, as an incentive to purchase. Some movie theaters and businesses handed out pieces to patrons.

Most of this glassware was made in the Ohio River Valley of the United States, where access to raw materials and power made manufacturing inexpensive in the first half of the twentieth century. More than twenty manufacturers made more than 100 patterns, and entire dinner sets were made in some patterns. Common colors are clear (crystal), pink, pale blue, green, and amber. Less common colors include yellow (canary), ultramarine, [[Jadeite (kitchenware)|jadeite]] (opaque pale green), delphite (opaque pale blue), cobalt blue, red (ruby and royal ruby), black, amethyst, monax, and white (milk glass).

Although of marginal quality, Depression glass has been highly collectible since the 1960s. Due to its popularity as a [[collectible]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/east-jefferson/index.ssf/2011/03/crescent_city_depression_glass.html|title=Crescent City Depression glass show to be held in Kenner|publisher=The Times-Picayune |date=March 17, 2011|accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is becoming more scarce on the open market. Rare pieces may sell for several hundred dollars. Some manufacturers continued to make popular patterns after World War II, or introduced similar patterns, which are also collectible. Popular and expensive patterns and pieces have been reproduced, and reproductions are still being made.

==Elegant glass==
Often confused with Depression glass is [[Elegant glass]], which is of much better quality. It was distributed through jewelry and department stores from the 1920s through the 1950s, and was an alternative to fine china. Most of the Elegant glassware manufacturers had closed by the end of the 1950s, when cheap glassware and imported china replaced Elegant glass. 

[[Image:Fostoriaplate.jpg|right|thumb|Fostoria plate]]

Some Elegant glass manufacturers were:
*[[Cambridge Glass Company]]
*[[Consolidated Lamp and Glass Company]]
*[[Duncan Miller Glass Company]]
*[[Fenton Art Glass Company]]
*[[Fostoria Glass Company]]
*[[Heisey Glass Company]]
*[[Imperial Glass Company]]
*[[Lotus Glass Company]]
*[[McKee Glass Company]]
*[[Morgantown Glass Works]]
*[[New Martinsville Glass Company]]
*[[Paden City Glass Company]]
*[[Tiffin Glass Company]]
*[[Westmoreland Glass Company]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4103">'''Emergent Design''' is a [[phrase]] coined by [[David Cavallo]] to describe a theoretical [[Conceptual framework|framework]] for the implementation of systemic change in education and learning environments.  This examines how choice of design [[methodology]] contributes to the success or failure of [[education reforms]] through studies in [[Thailand]]. It is related to the theories of [[situated learning]] and of [[constructionist learning]]. The term constructionism was coined by [[Seymour Papert]] under whom Cavallo studied. Emergent Design holds that education systems cannot adapt effectively to technology change unless the education is rooted in the existing skills and needs of the local culture.

== Applications ==
The most notable non-theoretical application of the principles of emergent design is in the [[OLPC XO|OLPC]], whose concept work is supported in Cavallo's paper "Models of growth &amp;mdash; towards fundamental change in learning environment".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.media.mit.edu/publications/bttj/Paper11Pages96-112.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergent design in agile software development ==
Emergent design is a consistent topic in [[agile software development]], as a result of the methodology's focus on delivering small pieces of working code with business value. With emergent design, a development organization starts delivering functionality and lets the design emerge. Development will take a piece of functionality A and implement it using best practices and proper test coverage and then move on to delivering functionality B. Once B is built, or while it is being built, the organization will look at what A and B have in common and refactor out the commonality, allowing the design to emerge. This process continues as the organization continually delivers functionality. At the end of an agile release cycle, development is left with the smallest set of the design needed, as opposed to the design that could have been anticipated in advance. The end result is a simpler design with a smaller code base, which is more easily understood and maintained and naturally has less room for defects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agilesherpa.org/agile_coach/engineering_practices/emergent_design Emergent design discussion at agileSherpa]&lt;/ref&gt;. Practices like Change Vector Tracking has helped teams adopting Emergent design as their design philosophy more systematic, disciplined and pragmatic.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite paper

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergent Design for social change ==
Emergent Design is also being used in social change movements, such as a group of Canadian NGOs that are bringing together a group of civic leaders to discuss how their work scales up and scales deep. A series of events are being organized by the Carold Institute and [[Ashoka: Innovators for the Public|Ashoka Canada]] in 2013 through to 2015. The project goals currently include, but are not limited to:
* Engage emerging leaders in redefining models and systems that will support a vibrant and dynamic civil society in Canada.
* Strengthen and broaden the impact of their leadership
* Discover and disseminate new knowledge related to systems change and emerging systems
* Share key learning, insights, innovative strategies and new models of engagement among participants and with key stakeholders and sponsoring organizations

The '''European Consortium for Political Research''' ('''ECPR''') is an independent scholarly association that supports and encourages the training, research and cross-national cooperation of many thousands of academics and graduate students specialising in political science and all its sub-disciplines. ECPR membership is institutional rather than individual and, at its inception in 1970, comprised eight members ([[University of Bergen|Bergen]], [[University of Gothenburg|Gothenburg]], [[University of Essex|Essex]], [[Leiden University|Leiden]], [[University of Mannheim|Mannheim]], [[Nuffield College]] ([[University of Oxford|Oxford]]), [[University of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]] and [[Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques|Paris (FNSP)]]). Membership has now grown to encompass more than 350 institutions throughout [[Europe]], with associate members spread across the world.

;ECPR activities include
* Organising workshops, roundtables, conferences and summer schools
* Publishing journals, books, articles and newsletters
* Providing a comprehensive European information source for political scientists through its website, electronic bulletin and online searchable databases
* Promoting teaching and training and the discipline in general through the professional journal [[European Political Science]] (EPS) and summer schools.

The ECPR has close links with similar organisations, such as the [[American Political Science Association]] (APSA), European national associations and the [[International Political Science Association]] (IPSA).

FSEC's mission is to research and develop energy technologies that enhance Florida's and the nation's economy and environment, and to educate the public, students and practitioners on the results of the research. The Center has gained national and international recognition for its wide range of research, education, training and certification activities.

==Operations==
The Center's 150-member staff includes 95 professionals with expertise in engineering, energy research, building science, energy and policy analysis, and education and training. The remainder of the staff consists of technical and administrative support personnel and university student assistants. Research at FSEC is based on field monitoring, computer simulations and controlled experiments in highly instrumented laboratories. These research efforts are developed in partnership with industry, nonprofit organizations, private sponsors and national laboratories.

==Research and grants==
In October 2009, the [[United States Department of Energy]] provided a $2.8 million grant to Solar Energy Center to help lead efforts to create and manage the newly created [[Solar Installer Instructor Training Network]].&lt;ref name="grant"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://today.ucf.edu/blog/2009/10/16/ucf-gets-28m-from-doe-for-solar-network/ |title=UCF Gets $2.8M From DOE for Solar Network |accessdate=2009-10-19 |publisher=University of Central Florida |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019151058/http://today.ucf.edu/blog/2009/10/16/ucf-gets-28m-from-doe-for-solar-network/ |archivedate=2009-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The training network is a five-year effort intended to create a geographic blanket of training opportunities in solar installations across the United States. Its goals are to accelerate market adoption of solar technologies by ensuring that high-quality installations are standard and to create sustainable jobs within the solar installation industry. FSEC will operate the Southeast region of the seven-region network."&lt;ref name="grant"/&gt;

'''The Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants''' (or simply the '''''Glass Flowers''''') is a collection of highly realistic [[glass]] [[botany|botanical]] models at the [[Harvard Museum of Natural History]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].

Created by [[Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka]] from 1887 through 1936 at their studio in [[Hosterwitz]], near [[Dresden, Germany]], the collection was commissioned by [[George Lincoln Goodale]], the first director of Harvard's [[Botanical Museum]], and was financed by [[Mary Lee Ware]] and her mother [[Elizabeth Cabot (Lee) Ware|Elizabeth C. Ware]].&lt;ref&gt;Blaschka Plants Blend Science and Artistry (NYT) - https://www.nytimes.com/1976/03/08/archives/new-jersey-pages-blaschka-plants-blend-science-and-artistry.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; It includes 847 life-size models (representing 780 species and varieties of plants in 164 families) and some 3,000 detail models such as of plant parts and anatomical sections. The collection comprises approximately 4,400 individual glass models representing over 830 plant species.

==Background==
{{main|Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka}}
[[File:Rudolf, Leopold and Caroline Blaschka in garden cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Rudolf (standing) and Leopold Blaschka]]
Starting in 1863 the Blaschkas had a thriving business making glass models of [[marine invertebrate]]s, selling them to museums and private collectors in a global enterprise (see {{crossreference|[[Glass sea creatures]]}}).&lt;ref&gt;http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2016/10/exhibition-talk-film-explore-sea-glass&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 1886, the Blaschkas were approached by Professor Goodale who, after seeing their work, had gone Dresden to ask them to make a series of glass botanical models for Harvard; the reason for the request being that only used method at time was showcasing pressed and carefully labeled specimens—a methodology that offered a twofold problem: being pressed, the specimens were two-dimensional and tended to lose their color, two drawbacks which glass models did not have.&lt;ref name="hmnh.harvard.edu"&gt;http://hmnh.harvard.edu/glass-flowers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nasonline.org"&gt;http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/goodale-george.pdf National Academy of Sciences Biographical Memoir&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold was hesitant but eventually agreed to make some sample models which, though badly damaged in customs,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmog.org/article/glass-flowers&lt;/ref&gt; convinced Goodale of their value in botanical teaching.&lt;ref name="hmnh.harvard.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nasonline.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nasonline.org"/&gt;

To fund the project Goodale approached his former student Mary Lee Ware and her mother, Elizabeth [[Cabot family|C.]] Ware, who were already liberal benefactors of Harvard's botanical department.&lt;ref&gt;Flowers that never fade / Franklin Baldwin Wiley. Boston Bradlee Whidden, Publisher 1897&lt;/ref&gt; The original arrangement (in 1887) provided that the Blaschkas would work half time on the project, but in 1890 a new arrangement called for them to work full-time.&lt;ref name="Schultes, Richard Evans 1982"&gt;Schultes, Richard Evans., William A. Davis, and Hillel Burger. The Glass Flowers at Harvard. New York: Dutton, 1982. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Archives of Rudolph and Leopold Blaschka and the Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants - http://botlib.huh.harvard.edu/libraries/glass.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The work continued until 1936, at which point Leopold and Elizabeth had both died.&lt;ref name="nasonline.org"/&gt;

The collection is formally dedicated to [[Charles Eliot Ware|Dr. Charles Eliot Ware]], the deceased father and husband of Mary and Elizabeth Ware, respectively.&lt;ref name="hmnh.harvard.edu"/&gt;

==The models==
[[File:Ware Dedication plaque.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1|"In memory of physician Charles Eliot Ware (1814{{ndash}}1887), a graduate of this university. These models were presented by his wife and daughter who survived him. He sincerely cherished and deeply loved native plants as friends."]]
The models are glass with wire supports (internal or external), glue, a variety of organic media,{{Explain|date=March 2017}} and paint or enamel coloring.&lt;ref&gt;NcNally, Rika Smith and Nancy Buschini (1993). [http://aic.stanford.edu/jaic/articles/jaic32-03-002_1.html Journal of the American Institute for Conservation], Volume 32, Number 3, Article 2 (pp. 231 to 240)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Boston Globe'' has called them "anatomically perfect and, given all the glass-workers who've tried and failed, unreproducible."&lt;ref&gt;Putting the Glass Flowers in new light - http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/05/putting-the-glass-flowers-in-new-light/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harvard's glass flowers return - https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/theater-art/2016/05/24/harvard-glass-flowers-return/SwICUX1ZgpsP3CPPeMbpuO/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GlassFlowers4HMNH.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4]]

It is often said that the Blaschkas employed secret techniques now lost; in fact their techniques were common at the time, but their skill, enthusiasm, and meticulous study and observation of their subjects in life were extraordinary, which Leopold ascribed to familial tradition, in a letter to Mary Lee Ware: "Many people think that we have some secret apparatus by which we can squeeze glass suddenly into these forms{{nbsp}} ... &lt;!--, but it is not so. We have tact. My son Rudolf has more than I have, because he is my son, and tact increases in every generation.--&gt; The only way to become a glass modeler of skill, I have often said to people, is to get a good great-grandfather who loved glass."

The Blaschkas' primary technique was [[lampworking]], in which glass is melted over a flame fed by air from a foot-powered bellows, then shaped using tools to pinch, pull or cut; forms were blown as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glass Dictionary|url=http://www.cmog.org/research/glass-dictionary/l|publisher=Corning Museum of Glass|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their old-fashioned Bohemian lamp-working table is part of the museum exhibit.
Over the years Rudolf brought more and more of the entire production process under his personal control, eventually even manufacturing his own glass and colorants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Zone Books| isbn = 978-1-890951-43-6| last = Daston| first = Lorraine| title = Things that talk : object lessons from art and science| chapter = The Glass Flowers| location = New York| date = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Botanist Donald Schnell has called the models "enchanting", and relates his surprise at finding that the models faithfully depict an unpublished detail of a bee's behavior while pollinating a particular plant{{emdash}}a detail which he had privately hypothesized.&lt;ref&gt;Schnell, Donald (2002). Carnivorous Plants of the United States and Canada. Timber Press. {{ISBN|0-88192-540-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Whitehouse and Small wrote that "the superiority in design and construction of the Blaschka models surpasses all modern model making to date and the skill and art of the Blaschkas rests in peace for eternity."{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The Glass Flowers is one of the most noted tourist attractions of the Boston area. More than 210,000 visitors view the collection annually. In 1936, when Harvard invited the public to tour the campus in honor of its tercentenary, a ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter taking the tour commented "Tercentenary or no, the chief focus of interest remains the famous glass flowers, the first of which was put on exhibition in 1893, and which with additions at intervals since, have never failed to draw exclamations of wonder or disbelief from visitors."&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18570">'''Groundwater banking''' is a [[water management]] mechanism designed to increase water supply reliability.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Semitropic Water Storage District. FAQs. &lt;http://www.semitropic.com/GndwtrBankFAQs.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Groundwater]] can be created by using dewatered [[aquifer]] space to store water during the years when there is abundant [[rainfall]]. It can then be pumped and used during years that don’t have a surplus of water.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt; People can manage the use of groundwater to benefit society through the purchasing and selling of these groundwater rights. The surface water should be used first, and then the groundwater will be used when there isn’t enough [[surface water]] to meet [[water demand|demands]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Maliva, Robert G. "Groundwater Banking: Opportunities And Management Challenges." Water Policy 16.1 (2014): 144-156. Academic Search Complete. Web. 18 Nov. 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt; The groundwater will reduce the risk of relying on surface water and will maximize expected income.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There are regulatory storage-type aquifer recovery and storage systems which when water is injected into it gives the right to withdraw the water later on.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Groundwater banking has been implemented into semi-arid and arid [[southwestern United States]] because this is where there is the most need for extra water.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The overall goal is to transfer water from low-value to high-value uses by bringing buyers and sellers together.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Groundwater storage concepts ==
The bank is an aquifer used as an underground storage tank, and the recharge of water causes an increase in the volume of water stored in the aquifer to have increasing water levels.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the case of a withdrawal there would be a decrease in water levels.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The amount of water depends also on a couple of other factors including groundwater pumping by other users, leakage, and natural recharge.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The recharge of water by land application or injection increases the volume of water, and then some of the water will be used at a future time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It can be looked at as inputs of water minus outputs is equal to the change in water storage.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Another aspect is the [[hydrology]] which is the difference between dynamic and static response to recharge and abstraction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The water levels will rise or fall in the well during recharge and recovery.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Once recharge and recovery stops the water levels return to background levels, and one of the main issues is the change in static water levels after the dynamic response from recharge or recovery disappears.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

There can be some technical issues with the aquifer response to manage recharge and recovery.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; If the aquifer is hydraulically connected to body of water on the surface there are increases in the water table elevation as the result of managed recharge.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This could increase the rate of discharge or decrease the amount of induced recharge, and both of these cause water to leave the basin.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The recharge and recovery could also affect the lateral and vertical groundwater flow into the aquifer.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There is not always a one-to-one correspondence between the volume of water and the change in storage.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Methods of groundwater banking ==
&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;Groundwater banking&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; is accomplished in two ways: through in-lieu and direct recharge.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt; In-lieu recharge is storing water by utilizing surface water "in-lieu" of pumping groundwater, thereby storing an equal amount in the groundwater basin.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt; In-lieu recharge is the renewable surface water used to irrigate the farmland in place of using regular groundwater.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Recharge and Facilities|url = http://www.azwaterbank.gov/Water_Storage/Recharge_and_Facilities.htm|website = www.azwaterbank.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is helping to save more groundwater because the water stays in the aquifer to be used later.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Direct recharge is storing water by allowing it to percolate directly to storage in the groundwater basin.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt; With direct recharge it floods an area so that water seeps through the ground to get to the [[aquifer]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The water is then pumped out when there is more of a demand with the use of recovery wells.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Pros and cons ==
There are some disadvantages to retrieving this groundwater. As groundwater is withdrawn from below the surface, the ground above settles.&lt;ref name="test1"&gt;http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/thePossibilities/Imagine_08-11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This settling of land, known as subsidence, can fracture roads and building foundations and can burst water, sewer, and gas lines.&lt;ref name="test1" /&gt; This method hasn't been well tested yet, so there could be some negative impacts on the environment. Water is a public resource and this could make water become a private industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Groundwater Banking – Water Education Foundation|url = http://www.watereducation.org/aquapedia/groundwater-banking|website = www.watereducation.org|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groundwater banking can be compared and contrasted to the use of surface reservoirs. Groundwater banking has many advantages over the use of surface reservoirs. The projects do not cost as much to construct and store the same amount, if not more, than the surface reservoirs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = http://mavensnotebook.com/the-notebook-file-cabinet/groundwater-banking/|url = http://mavensnotebook.com/the-notebook-file-cabinet/groundwater-banking/|website = mavensnotebook.com|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bank will have less of an impact on the environment than a surface reservoir.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The water that is in the bank will no longer be exposed to [[evaporation]], but several feet per year of water is lost in the reservoirs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is more reliable to use when the [[climate]] is changing and can respond to seasonal changes better to manage the water than the surface reservoirs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are also some disadvantages to groundwater banking over surface reservoirs. There are energy costs to recovering the water and these costs are usually more than the reservoirs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There is also a pumping capacity and when the demands change during the year the productiveness can be limited.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Not all groundwater is used when sold. Some groundwater is being studied for its benefits. Groundwater banking and aquifer storage systems are being explored to control flooding during times of high precipitation.&lt;ref name="test2"&gt;http://www.cpo.noaa.gov/sites/cpo/Projects/SARP/CaseStudies/2013/Russian%20River%20Basin%20CA_Case%20Study%20Factsheet_Extreme%20Weather%20Events_2013-2-6v1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The groundwater is being traded in many regions. There are trades even in the United States. The city of [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]] is the largest city in the United States that relies solely on groundwater for its municipal supply.&lt;ref name="test2" /&gt;

== Feasibility of groundwater recharge on agricultural land ==
There have not been many successful trials of groundwater banking on agricultural land since the land is usually privately owned.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Greene|first=A.T.|date=April 2015|title=Soil suitability index identifies potential areas for groundwater banking on agricultural lands|url=http://calag.ucanr.edu/Archive/?article=ca.v069n02p75|journal=California Agriculture|volume=|pages=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=University of California, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owners have to be on board with the practice of groundwater banking knowing what the risks and best practices entail.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A study was done to find a Soil Agricultural Groundwater Banking Index (SAGBI) which evaluates [[soil]] suitability for the use of groundwater banking in [[California]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There are five factors that determine the feasibility of groundwater recharge on agricultural land: deep percolation, root zone residence time, [[topography]], chemical limitations, and soil surface conditions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The five factors were modeled using [[United States Department of Agriculture]] Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) digital soil survey data.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

For the deep percolation factor a high rate of water transmission through the [[soil profile]] and into the aquifer below is the key to successful groundwater banking.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It becomes more important when there is flooding since it could be used as the main water source.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It is derived from the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the limiting layer.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Saturated hydraulic conductivity measures soil permeability when the soil is saturated.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

When looking at root zone residence time factor it was found that a prolonged duration of saturated conditions in the root zone has the possibility to cause damage to perennial crops.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; If the soil causes a bud break it is more likely that the crop will become damaged.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Most crops aren’t able to withstand long periods of saturated conditions in the root zone.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The root zone residence time estimates the likelihood of having good enough drainage within the root zone once water is applied.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The topography of land for spreading water across fields has the best outcome when there is level topography.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Level topography works the best because it holds water better on the landscape which allows infiltration across large areas.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Infiltration basin|Infiltration]] reduces ponding and minimizes [[erosion]] by runoff.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The chemical limitations factor is related to the [[salinity]] which is a threat to the [[sustainability]] of [[agriculture]] and groundwater.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This factor was determined by [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical]] conductivity (EC) of the soil which measures the [[soil salinity]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The best soil has the lowest levels of salinity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Soil also has [[pesticide]]s and nitrate, but it is unable to be evaluated due to the dependency on management history.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The surface condition factor is when banking by flood spreading can change the soil surfaces physical conditions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Infiltrations limits can be caused by quality and depth of water that could lead to the destruction of aggregates, the formation of physical crusts, and compaction.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; To determine soil condition two factors were examined: soil erosion factor and sodium absorption ratio (SAR).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

To determine the feasibility of groundwater banking each of the five factors were assigned a weight to how significant it was, and then a SAGBI score was calculated.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The weights were 27.5% deep percolation, 27.5% root zone residence time, 20% topography, 20% chemical limitations, and 5% surface conditions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Of the 17.5 million acres of agricultural land examined only 5 million acres were considered soils with excellent, good, and moderately good suitability.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Agricultural groundwater banking can be associated with financial risk which may cause crop loss, so in the end, the loss may exceed the benefits of water saving.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Adoption of this practice would require support to protect growers from risk of crop failure.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Groundwater accounting system ==
The [[accounting]] system tracks the recharge and withdrawals of stored water and it can include a market system to reserve the storage of water.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Depositors could earn credits for the recharge of water which can be used later on for the water recovered from the bank.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The banking system could then be set up to allow trading of credits.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There are several objectives of the water bank accounting system: track water deposits, withdrawals, and to control the amount, timing, and location of withdrawals by the participants.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; If groundwater isn’t regulated there is more of a chance for [[freeriding]] and [[overexploitation|overuse]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There needs to be sustainability of the system in order to continue with the operation of the system or there would be no point to using it.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The accounting method that will be used is the double-entry accounting method, so every transaction is recorded as a debit and a credit in separate [[ledger]] accounts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This also allows for tracking of [[inventory]] in asset accounts and claims to inventory in ownership accounts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Deposits happen when more water is stored in an aquifer than there is supposed to be.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The recharge of water by a member would be a credit in a member's account and a liability in the bank's account.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For the bank to be successful then both ledgers have to be balanced, so the right to water in a member's accounts should be equal to the amount of water that can be recovered from the system.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; If the right to water is greater than liabilities then the bank is insolvent, and this will become a problem when a drought occurs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

There are some issues that could arise from using this water bank accounting system. These problems were evaluated for the Las Posas Basin groundwater bank and Fox Canyon Groundwater Management Agency (FCGMA) has jurisdiction over the project.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; FCGMA reported that the accumulation of credits has been increasing for banks.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; What can happen is the accumulated credits can become greater than the annual abstraction rate.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The volume of credits accumulating exceed the amount of water that can be taken out during a short-time period.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This will cause a threat to the regional groundwater resource or even depressions in groundwater elevations, land subsidence, and seawater intrusion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Regulatory framework ==
The banking systems need regulatory control over the basin to implement the withdrawal rates and to ensure that other participants will not extract too much stored water.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The best scenario would be that the bank owner or participants would be the main users to ensure that abstractions are controlled.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; If this is not the case, then there must be another way to control the number and amount of abstractions happening.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It needs to be clear who has priority over stored water, so that when abstractions are constrained it is known who will get the water first.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There can be problems when multiple entities have jurisdiction over a project, and this can cause regulatory and organizational challenges.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There are some generally accepted rules and also many of the issues are handled through state-specific concepts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; One of the main requirements is an action needs to be in place so that the stored water isn’t being abstracted by other users who aren’t involved in the system.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These frameworks rely on the knowledge of [[hydrogeology]] to determine the success of a system, and the systems need to provide benefits to prove it was worth building.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Economics ==
The different projects can become economically efficient by maximizing the benefits of the limited resource (water).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Groundwater Banking and the Conjunctive Management of Groundwater and Surface Water in the Upper Snake River Basin of Idah|last = Contor|first = Bryce|date = August 2009|journal = Idaho Water Resources Research Institute Technical Completion Report|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; To maximize efficiency the users need to find where [[marginal cost]] is equal to [[marginal benefit]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is important for supply to equal demand like in the figure below. The use of water becomes a negative [[externality]] when there is rivalry and the property rights are not well-defined.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The way to eliminate some of the negative externality is there can be a [[tax]] placed on the resource to increase the marginal cost.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When they tax the right amount the user will use the resource at the socially acceptable level.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The other way to affect the externality is to create a [[subsidy]]. A subsidy will increase the marginal benefit in order to get to the socially accepted level of use for the resource.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Simple supply and demand.svg|200x250px|Simple supply and demand]]

Water is not a homogeneous [[commodity]] for several reasons which include sensitivity to location, time of use, form of the water, and administrative responses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The use of groundwater banking can make water a more homogenous commodity. This can create a market value which will enhance private investment increasing the benefits.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It will also align marginal benefit with marginal cost causing the market to come to an economically-efficient level.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Water has high transaction costs and create market barriers which devalues the use to society restricting the reallocation of resources.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The demand does not change when there is a market barrier so there will be many unpleasant people if they don't get their share of water.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If a bank is in the process of being made the removal of market-access barriers can be part of the negotiations, but it isn't necessarily the bank itself that is the cause.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Groundwater banking could reduce transaction costs because each individual won't have to analyze each transaction.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''''Harry Clarke{{spaced ndash}}Darkness in Light '''''is a documentary film originally released in 2003 (Irish-language version titled Harry Clarke - Dorchadas i Solas).

==Synopsis==
Filmmaker [[John J Doherty]] traces the life and work of the [[Irish people|Irish]] artist, book illustrator and [[stained glass]] artist [[Harry Clarke]] (1889–1931) with major contributions from his biographer [[Nicola Gordon Bowe]] as well as many stained glass artists, poets and historians. The film takes the artist's work in [[stained glass]], which was mainly religious an ethereal, and in [[book illustration]], which was mainly dark &amp; fantastical, as the basis for its title and tells a story of talent, struggle, success and the [[censorship]] of his final masterpiece 'the Geneva Window'. [[Harry Clarke]] brought his expertise in working in fine decorative detail in glass to his book illustrations, most notably in the tales of [[Hans Christian Andersen]] and [[Edgar Allan Poe]] where he is compared to [[Aubrey Beardsley]] and which are featured in the film and paralleled with [[German Expressionist]] cinema of the time. The film was made in conjunction with the [[Irish Film Board]] and national broadcaster [[TG4]].

==Awards==
This film won the Best Arts Documentary award at the 2004 [[Celtic International Film Festival]].&lt;br /&gt;

'''Homoplasy''', in [[biology]] and [[phylogenetics]], is when a [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] has been gained or lost independently in separate lineages over the course of evolution. This is different from [[Homology (biology)|homology]], which is the similarity of traits due to common ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Torres-Montúfar A, Borsch T, Ochoterena H | title = When Homoplasy Is Not Homoplasy: Dissecting Trait Evolution by Contrasting Composite and Reductive Coding | journal = Systematic Biology | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 543–551 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 28645204 | doi = 10.1093/sysbio/syx053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Homoplasy can arise from both similar [[Natural selection|selection]] pressures acting on adapting species, and the effects of [[genetic drift]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Evolution: an introduction| vauthors = Stearns SC, Hoekstra RF |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn=9780199255634 |edition=2nd|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hall AR, Colegrave N | title = Decay of unused characters by selection and drift | journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 610–7 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18081745 | doi = 10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01473.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[File:Homoplasy.jpg|thumb|Homoplasy is the similarity in trait that is not due to a common ancestor.]]

Most often, homoplasy is viewed as a similarity in morphological traits. However, homoplasy may also appear in other trait types, such as similarity in the genetic sequence &lt;ref name="Reece2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanderson1996"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homoplasy: The Recurrence of Similarity in Evolution| vauthors =Sanderson MJ, Hufford L |publisher=Academic Press, Inc.|year=1996|isbn=0-12-618030-X|location=San Diego, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;, life cycle types &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Silberfeld T, Leigh JW, Verbruggen H, Cruaud C, de Reviers B, Rousseau F | title = A multi-locus time-calibrated phylogeny of the brown algae (Heterokonta, Ochrophyta, Phaeophyceae): Investigating the evolutionary nature of the "brown algal crown radiation" | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 56 | issue = 2 | pages = 659–74 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20412862 | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2010.04.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or even behavioral traits &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Queiroz A, Wimberger PH | title = The usefulness of behavior for phylogeny estimation: levels of homoplasy in behavioral and morphological characters | journal = Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 46–60 | date = February 1993 | pmid = 28568085 | doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.1993.tb01198.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanderson1996" /&gt;.

== Etymology ==
The term homoplasy was first used by [[Ray Lankester]] in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Lankester ER |year=1870|title=On the use of the term homology in modern zoology, and the distinction between homogenetic and homoplastic agreements.|journal=Annals and Magazine of Natural History|volume=6|pages=34-43|doi=10.1080/00222937008696201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding adjective is either ''homoplasic'' or ''homoplastic''.
It is derived from the two [[ancient greek]] words {{wikt-lang|grc|ὁμός}} ({{grc-transl|ὁμός}}), meaning "similar, alike, the same", and {{wikt-lang|grc|πλάσσω}} ({{grc-transl|πλάσσω}}), meaning "to shape, to mold".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Abrégé du dictionnaire grec français |last=Bailly |first=Anatole | name-list-format = vanc |date=1981-01-01 |publisher=Hachette |isbn=2010035283 |location=Paris |oclc=461974285 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tabularium.be/bailly/ |title=Greek-french dictionary online |last=Bailly |first=Anatole | name-list-format = vanc|date= |website=www.tabularium.be | |access-date=October 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://comenius.susqu.edu/biol/202/dictionary%20of%20terms/h/homoplasy.htm|title=Systematic Biology - Dictionary of Terms: Homoplasy| vauthors = Holt JR, Judica CA |date=February 4, 2014| |access-date=September 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reece2011"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Campbell Biology| vauthors = Reece JB, Urry LA, Cain ML, Wasserman SA, Minorsky PV, Jackson RB  |publisher=Pearson|year=2011|isbn=9780321739759|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parallelism and convergence ==
[[Parallel evolution|Parallel]] and [[convergent evolution]] lead to homoplasy when different species independently evolve or gain a comparable trait, which diverges from the trait inferred to have been present in their common ancestor. When the similar traits are caused by an equivalent developmental mechanism, the process is referred to as parallel evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Archie JW |year=1989|title=Homoplasy excess ratios: new indices for measuring levels of homoplasy in phylogenetic systematics and a critique of the consistency index|journal=Systematic Biology|volume=38|pages=253-269|doi=10.2307/2992286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Wake DB |date= September 1991 |title=Homoplasy: The Result of Natural Selection, or Evidence of Design Limitations? |journal=The American Naturalist|language=en|volume=138|issue=3|pages=543–567|doi=10.1086/285234 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process is called convergent evolution when the similarity arises from different developmental mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Hodin J |year=2000|title=Plasticity and constraints in development and evolution|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology|volume=288|pages=1-20|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-010X(20000415)288:1&lt;1::AID-JEZ1&gt;3.0.CO;2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of homoplasy may occur when different lineages live in comparable ecological niches that require similar adaptations for an increase in fitness. An interesting example is that of the marsupial moles ([[Notoryctidae]]), golden moles ([[Chrysochloridae]]) and northern moles ([[Talpidae]]). These are mammals from different geographical regions and lineages, and have all independently evolved very similar burrowing characteristics (such as a cone-shaped heads and flat frontal claws) to live in a subterranean ecological niche &lt;ref name="Nevo1979"&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Nevo E |year=1979|title=Adaptive convergence and divergence of subterranean mammals|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=10|pages=269-308|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.10.110179.001413}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Reversion ==
In contrast, [[Reverse evolution|reversal]] (a.k.a. vestigialization) leads to homoplasy through the disappearance of previously gained traits &lt;ref name="Wake2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wake DB, Wake MH, Specht CD | title = Homoplasy: from detecting pattern to determining process and mechanism of evolution | journal = Science | volume = 331 | issue = 6020 | pages = 1032–5 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21350170 | doi = 10.1126/science.1188545 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. This process may result from changes in the environment in which certain gained traits are no longer relevant, or have even become costly &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Fong DW, Kane TC, Culver DC |year=1995|title=Vestigialization and loss of nonfunctional characters|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=26|pages=249-68|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.26.110195.001341}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall2008" /&gt;. This can be observed in subterranean and cave-dwelling animals by their loss of sight &lt;ref name="Nevo1979" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones1989"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jones R, Culver DC | title = EEvidence for selection on sensory structures in a cave population of ''Gammarus minus'' (Amphipoda) | journal = Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution | volume = 43 | issue = 3 | pages = 688–693 | date = May 1989 | pmid = 28568387 | doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.1989.tb04267.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;, in cave-dwelling animals through their loss of pigmentation &lt;ref name="Jones1989" /&gt;, and in both snakes and legless lizards through their loss of limbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Skinner A, Lee MS |year=2009|title=Body-form evolution in the scincid lizard ''Lerista'' and the mode of macroevolutionary transitions|journal=Evolutionary Biology|volume=36|pages=292-300|doi=10.1007/s11692-009-9064-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Skinner A, Lee MS, Hutchinson MN | title = Rapid and repeated limb loss in a clade of scincid lizards | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 8 | pages = 310 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 19014443 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2148-8-310 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinguishing homology from homoplasy ==

Homoplasy, especially the type that occurs in more closely related phylogenetic groups, can make phylogenetic analysis more challenging. [[Phylogenetic tree|Phylogenetic trees]] are created by means of [[parsimony analysis]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Phylogenetics: Theory and Practice of Phylogenetic Systematics| vauthors = Wiley EO, Lieberman BS |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=2011 |isbn=9780470905968 |location=Hoboken, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biological Systematics: Principles and Applications| vauthors = Schuh RT, Brower AV |publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780801462436|location=Ithaca, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These analyses can be done with phenotypic, as well as genetic traits (DNA sequences) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inferring phylogenies|vauthors = Felsenstein J |publisher=Sinauer|year=2004|isbn=978-0878931774}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Using parsimony analysis, the hypothesis that requires the fewest evolutionary changes is preferred over alternative hypotheses. Construction of these trees may become a challenge when clouded by the occurrence of homoplasy in the traits used for the analysis. The most important approach in overcoming these challenges, is by increasing the amount of independent (non-[[Pleiotropy|pleiotropic]], non-[[Genetic linkage|linked]]) characteristics used in the construction of these phylogenic trees. Along with parsimony analysis, one could perform a likelihood analysis, where the probability of a tree being true is calculated and branch lengths are measured; and bootstrapping, in which trees are constructed for each characteristic separately to estimate the confidence of a tree.&lt;ref name="Sanderson1996" /&gt;

According to [[Cladogram#Measuring homoplasy|cladistic interpretation]], homoplasy can be identified when a given similarity in trait cannot be explained by relation through a common ancestor on a preferred phylogenetic hypothesis - that is, the feature in question arises (or disappears) at more than one point on the tree &lt;ref name="Wake2011" /&gt;.

In the case of DNA sequences, homoplasy cannot be avoided due to its four-state nature. An observed homoplasy may simply be the result of  [[Genetic drift|random nucleotide substitutions]] accumulating over time, and thus may not need an [[adaptationist]] evolutionary explanation &lt;ref name="Sanderson1996" /&gt;.

== Examples and applications of homoplasy ==

There are numerous documented examples of homoplasy within the following taxa:
* Eusiroidea ([[Crustaceans]] and [[Amphipoda]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Verheye ML, Martin P, Backeljau T, D'Udekem D'Acoz C |date=2015-12-22|title=DNA analyses reveal abundant homoplasy in taxonomically important morphological characters of Eusiroidea (Crustacea, Amphipoda) |journal=Zoologica Scripta |volume=45|issue=3|pages=300–321|doi=10.1111/zsc.12153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Urticaceae]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu ZY, Milne RI, Chen CJ, Liu J, Wang H, Li DZ | title = Ancestral State Reconstruction Reveals Rampant Homoplasy of Diagnostic Morphological Characters in Urticaceae, Conflicting with Current Classification Schemes | journal = PloS One | volume = 10 | issue = 11 | pages = e0141821 | date = 2015-11-03 | pmid = 26529598 | pmc = 4631448 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0141821 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Asteraceae]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Mejías JA, Chambouleyron M, Kim SH, Infante MD, Kim SC, Léger JF |date=2018-07-19|title=Phylogenetic and morphological analysis of a new cliff-dwelling species reveals a remnant ancestral diversity and evolutionary parallelism in Sonchus (Asteraceae) |journal=Plant Systematics and Evolution|language=en|volume=304|issue=8|pages=1023–1040|doi=10.1007/s00606-018-1523-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Polypodioideae]] (Selligueoid Ferns),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = He L, Schneider H, Hovenkamp P, Marquardt J, Wei R, Wei X, Zhang X, Xiang Q |date=2018-05-09|title=A molecular phylogeny of selligueoid ferns (Polypodiaceae): Implications for a natural delimitation despite homoplasy and rapid radiation |journal=Taxon|volume=67|pages=237–249|doi=10.12705/672.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ants]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Schär S, Talavera G, Espadaler X, Rana JD, Andersen Andersen A, Cover SP, Vila R |date=2018-06-27|title=Do Holarctic ant species exist? Trans-Beringian dispersal and homoplasy in the Formicidae |journal=Journal of Biogeography |volume=45|issue=8|pages=1917–1928 |doi=10.1111/jbi.13380 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Merluccius capensis]] (Cape Hakes) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Henriques R, von der Heyden S, Matthee CA | title = When homoplasy mimics hybridization: a case study of Cape hakes (Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus) | journal = PeerJ | volume = 4 | pages = e1827 | date = 2016-03-28 | pmid = 27069785 | doi = 10.7717/peerj.1827 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tarantula]] spiders of the genus ''Bonnetina'': nearly all morphological traits within this genus are homoplastic. Only sexual features were observed to not be homoplastic, suggesting that sexual selection may have been a driving force in the divergence of tarantulas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ortiz D, Francke OF, Bond JE | title = A tangle of forms and phylogeny: Extensive morphological homoplasy and molecular clock heterogeneity in Bonnetina and related tarantulas | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 127 | pages = 55–73 | date = October 2018 | pmid = 29778724 | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2018.05.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[gharials]], with homoplasy between ''Tomistoma'' and true crocodiles, and between thoracosaurs and ''Gavialis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee MS, Yates AM | title = Tip-dating and homoplasy: reconciling the shallow molecular divergences of modern gharials with their long fossil record | journal = Proceedings. Biological Sciences | volume = 285 | issue = 1881 | pages = 20181071 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 30051855 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2018.1071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The occurrence of homoplasy can also be used to make predictions about evolution. Recent studies have used homoplasy to predict the possibility and the path of extraterrestrial evolution. For example, Levin et al. (2017) suggest that the development of eye-like structures is highly likely, due to its numerous, independently evolved incidences on earth.&lt;ref name="Wake2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Levin SR, Scott TW, Cooper HS, West SA |year=2017|title=Darwin's aliens|journal=International Journal of Astrobiology|pages=1-9|doi=10.1017/S1473550417000362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Homoplasy vs. evolutionary contingency ==

In his book [[Wonderful Life (book)|''Wonderful Life'']], [[Stephen Jay Gould]] claims that repeating the evolutionary process, from any point in time onward, would not produce the same results &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History| vauthors = Gould SJ |publisher=Vintage Books|year=2000|isbn=9780099273455|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The occurrence of homoplasy is viewed by some biologists as an argument against Gould’s theory of evolutionary contingency. Powell &amp; Mariscal (2015) argue that this disagreement is caused by an [[equivocation]] and that both the theory of contingency as well as homoplastic occurrence can be true at the same time &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Powell R, Mariscal C | title = Convergent evolution as natural experiment: the tape of life reconsidered | journal = Interface Focus | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 20150040 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26640647 | doi = 10.1098/rsfs.2015.0040 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Exhibitions ===

* '''I International Exhibition of Calligraphy'''

Repin State Academic Institute of Painting Sculpture and Architecture hosted the I International Exhibition of Calligraphy on September 16–21, 2008. On the first day, more than 500 people visited it even before the official opening.480 works from 25 states were presented. In total, over 700 works were submitted for the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://peterburg2.ru/news/927.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824084342/http://peterburg2.ru/news/927.html |archivedate=2011-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 20 lectures and workshops from Russian and foreign artists were held during the five days of the Exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calligraphy-expo.ru/en/ Business program-2008]{{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition boasted with the presence of 40 renowned international calligraphers.&lt;ref&gt;"As we write, and think", Information Portal "REN TV", 23.09.2008&lt;/ref&gt;

''Interesting facts''

The welcome book was to be posted an entry in with ink and quill.

All female visitors on the last day of the Exhibition were presented with white roses.

Visitors of the event included a just-married couple and a group of cadets.

* '''Mystery of the world calligraphy (special exposition)'''

December 9–14, 2008 the Contemporary Museum of Calligraphy held the special exhibit ‘Mysteries of the world calligraphy’ dedicated to the Constitution Day. A formal trigger to launch this exhibit was the arrival of a new item: the Handwritten Constitution of the Russian Federation, first of its kind in the Post-Soviet Russia. This A2-sized work has been performed in five months by Pyotr Chobitko, Chairman of the National Union of Calligraphers, in person (with the exception of lining the sheets).

The exhibition featured several workshops and lectures by Russian and international artists.&lt;gallery perrow="3" widths="200" heights="130"&gt;

* '''III International Exhibition of Calligraphy'''

The III International Exhibition of Calligraphy was successfully held September 10–12, 2010 in Veliky Novgorod. A special-built mobile pavilion erected in the city historic centre near the Kremlin in Yaroslav’s Court became its venue. The project’s unique feature is that the event was the first ever large-scale travelling exhibition of a current [[International Council of Museums|ICOM]] member.The Exhibition received RUEF (Russian Union of exhibitions and fairs) approval for high professional level of exhibitions organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://calligraphy-expo.com/eng/about/News.aspx?ItemID=1503 "The RUEF certificate was granted!"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219145326/http://calligraphy-expo.com/eng/about/News.aspx?ItemID=1503# |date=2014-02-19 }}, Official site of the project, 03-03-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

— Over 37000 visitors attended the event over the three days

— 19 trucks with equipment and exhibits travelled from Moscow to Novgorod to make it happen

— They carried 136 tons of cargo

— A team of 91 from the Contemporary Museum of Calligraphy and the MVK International Exhibition Company came from Moscow to prepare the exhibition.

Over the four days of the event, 46 workshops were held. In total, 35 renowned calligraphy artists took part in the exhibition. Novgorod residents had a chance to see over 300 calligraphy exhibits, including some listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.

For the first time a wakeboarding tournament for WakeWorld Russia Cup took place within the Exhibition, with best professional riders from Russia, Europe and Asia. The Museum Night project was also held in cooperation with the Novgorod State United Museum-Reserve.

* '''IV International Exhibition of Calligraphy'''

Date — November 1 – December 15, 2012. Venue — the [[Museum of Calligraphy|Contemporary museum of calligraphy]].

10 new authors from European and Eastern countries with their distinct styles and personalities took part in the 4th International Exhibition of Calligraphy. Valerian Bakharev’s “I Ching Signs” consisting of 64 hexagrammic paintings became the symbol of the exposition.

The unique feature of this exhibition was the fact that the exposition changed 6 times. The program included lectures and workshops for both adults and children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m24.ru/videos/5031 “The 4th International Exhibition of Calligraphy opened in Sokolniki”], Moskva 24 TV-channel, November 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''V International Exhibition of Calligraphy'''

V International Exhibition of Calligraphy was held in Moscow March 14 through April 12, 2015. The anniversary event boasted with the participation of a recorв number of participants: 90 artists from 52 countries who presented 201 calligraphy artworks. The theme of the exposition was ‘Reflections on the Motherland’.

== Project’s development ==

=== National Union of Calligraphers ===

On May 14, 2008 the National Union of Calligraphers was established at the International Exhibition of Calligraphy. The handwritten charter with many famous Russian calligraphers’ signatures testifies to the Union’s birth. Under the Charter the Union aims at revival of the art of calligraphy in Russia, creating conditions for its development and admitting everybody who is willing to learn the beauty of writing. Petr Chobitko was elected Chairman of the Union with Alexey Shaburov as its President.

The most outstanding Union’s masterpiece is the Handwritten Constitution of the Russian Federation performed by Pyotr Chobitko in person. It is stored at Contemporary Museum of Calligraphy. Miniature copies of the piece have been prepared as gift editions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11103">'''Isozymes''' (also known as '''isoenzymes''' or more generally as '''multiple forms of enzymes''') are [[enzyme]]s that differ in amino acid sequence but catalyze the same chemical reaction.  These enzymes usually display different kinetic parameters (e.g. different [[Michaelis-Menten kinetics|''K''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;]] values), or different regulatory properties.
The existence of isozymes permits the fine-tuning of metabolism to meet the particular needs of a given tissue or developmental stage (for example [[lactate dehydrogenase]] (LDH)).
In [[biochemistry]], isozymes (or isoenzymes) are [[isoform]]s (closely related variants) of enzymes. In many cases, they are coded for by [[homology (biology)|homologous]] genes that have diverged over time.  Although, strictly speaking, [[allozyme]]s represent     enzymes from different [[allele]]s of the same [[gene]], and isozymes represent enzymes from different genes that process or [[catalyse]] the same reaction, the two words are usually used interchangeably.

==Introduction==
Isozymes were first described by [[R. L. Hunter]] and [[Clement Markert]] (1957) who defined them as ''different variants of the same enzyme having identical functions and present in the same individual''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Markert|first=Clement L.|last2=Moller|first2=Freddy|year=1959|title=Multiple forms of enzymes: tissue, ontogenetic, and species specific patterns.|url=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=45|pages=753–763|doi=10.1073/pnas.45.5.753|pmc=222630}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition encompasses (1) enzyme variants that are the product of different genes and thus represent different [[locus (genetics)|loci]] (described as ''isozymes'') and (2) enzymes that are the product of different [[alleles]] of the same gene (described as ''allozymes'').&lt;ref name="Kearney"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kearney |title=Fundamental Genetics |date=2014 |publisher=McNaughton Publishing |pages=413-414 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isozymes are usually the result of [[gene duplication]], but can also arise from [[polyploidy|polyploidisation]] or [[nucleic acid hybridization]]. Over evolutionary time, if the function of the new variant remains ''identical'' to the original, then it is likely that one or the other will be lost as [[mutation]] accumulate, resulting in a [[pseudogene]]. However, if the mutations do not immediately prevent the enzyme from functioning, but instead modify either its function, or its pattern of [[gene expression]], then the two variants may both be favoured by [[natural selection]] and become specialised to different functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gerald, Gerald |title=The Biology Book: From the Origin of Life to Epigenetics, 250 Milestones in the History of Biology |date=2015 |publisher=Sterling |page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, they may be expressed at different stages of development or in different tissues.&lt;ref name="Huang"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huang, Le |title=Genome |date=2009 |publisher=Grady-McPherson |page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allozymes may result from [[point mutation]]s or from insertion-deletion ([[mutation|''indel'']]) events that affect the [[DNA]] coding sequence of the [[gene]]. As with any other new [[mutations]], there are three things that may happen to a new allozyme:

# It is most likely that the new allele will be non-functional&amp;mdash;in which case it will probably result in low [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] and be removed from the population by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Alberts"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alberts |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell |date=2017 |publisher=Garland Science |page=649 |edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Alternatively, if the [[amino acid]] residue that is changed is in a relatively unimportant part of the enzyme (e.g., a long way from the [[active site]]), then the mutation may be [[Neutral theory of molecular evolution|selectively neutral]] and subject to [[genetic drift]].&lt;ref name="Walstrom"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walstrom, Ford et al |title=Models of genetics and natural selection: a current biomolecular understanding |journal=Biomolecular Ecology |date=2014 |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=1021-1034}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# In rare cases, the mutation may result in an enzyme that is more efficient, or one that can catalyse a slightly different [[chemical reaction]], in which case the mutation may cause an increase in fitness, and be favoured by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Walstrom"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==An example==
An example of an isozyme is [[glucokinase]], a variant of [[hexokinase]] which is not inhibited by [[glucose 6-phosphate]]. Its different regulatory features and lower affinity for glucose (compared to other hexokinases), allows it to serve different functions in cells of specific organs, such as control of [[insulin]] release by the [[beta cell]]s of the [[pancreas]], or initiation of [[glycogen]] synthesis by [[liver]] cells. Both of these processes must only occur when glucose is abundant, or problems occur.

The enzyme [[lactate dehydrogenase]] is made of two (H-form and M-Form) different sub units, combines in different [[Permutations and combinations|combinations]] depending on the tissue in which it is present as shown in the table below,

==Distinguishing isozymes ==
Isozymes (and allozymes) are variants of the same enzyme. Unless they are identical in terms of their biochemical properties, for example their [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] and [[enzyme kinetics]], they may be distinguished by a [[biochemical assay]]. However, such differences are usually subtle (particularly between ''allozymes'' which are often  [[Neutral theory of molecular evolution|neutral variants]]). This subtlety is to be expected, because two enzymes that differ significantly in their function are unlikely to have been identified as ''isozymes''.

Whilst isozymes may be almost identical in function, they may differ in other ways. In particular, [[amino acid]] substitutions that change the [[electric charge]] of the enzyme (such as replacing [[aspartic acid]] with [[glutamic acid]]) are simple to identify by [[gel electrophoresis]], and this forms the basis for the use of isozymes as [[molecular marker]]s. To identify isozymes, a crude protein extract is made by grinding animal or plant tissue with an extraction buffer, and the components of extract are separated according to their charge by gel electrophoresis. Historically, this has usually been done using gels made from [[potato starch]], but [[acrylamide]] gels provide better resolution.

All the proteins from the tissue are present in the gel, so that individual enzymes must be identified using an assay that links their function to a staining reaction. For example, detection can be based on the localised [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of soluble indicator [[dye]]s such as [[tetrazolium salts]] which become insoluble when they are [[Redox|reduced]] by [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] such as [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]] or [[NADP]], which generated in zones of enzyme activity. This assay method requires that the enzymes are still functional after separation ([[native gel electrophoresis]]), and provides the greatest challenge to using isozymes as a laboratory technique.

Isoenzymes differ in kinetics (they have different Km and Vmax values).

==Isozymes and allozymes as molecular markers ==
[[Population genetics]] is essentially a study of the causes and effects of genetic variation within and between populations, and in the past, isozymes have been amongst the most widely used [[molecular marker]]s for this purpose. Although they have now been largely superseded by more informative [[DNA]]-based approaches (such as direct [[DNA sequencing]], [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s and [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellites]]), they are still amongst the quickest and cheapest marker systems to develop, and remain ({{As of|2005|lc=on}}) an excellent choice for projects that only need to identify low levels of genetic variation, e.g. quantifying [[mating system]]s.

==Other major examples==
*The [[cytochrome P450]] isozymes play important roles in [[metabolism]] and [[steroidogenesis]].
*The multiple forms of [[phosphodiesterase]] also play major roles in various biological processes.   Although more than one form of these enzymes have been found in individual cells, these isoforms of the enzyme are unequally distributed in the various cells of an organism.  From the clinical standpoint they have been found to be selectively activated and inhibited, an observation which has led to their use in therapy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5400">'''KWIC''' is an acronym for '''Key Word In Context''', the most common format for [[concordance (publishing)|concordance]] lines. The term KWIC was first coined by [[Hans Peter Luhn]].&lt;ref&gt;Manning, C. D., Schütze, H.: "Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing", p.35. The MIT Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The system was based on a concept called ''keyword in titles'' which was first proposed for Manchester libraries in 1864 by [[Andrea Crestadoro]].&lt;ref name="index"&gt;{{cite book|title=Advanced Indexing and Abstracting Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIUkl7bLzYUC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=Andrea+Crestadoro#v=onepage&amp;q=Andrea%20Crestadoro&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''KWIC''' index is formed by sorting and aligning the words within an article title to allow each word (except the [[stop words]]) in titles to be searchable alphabetically in the index.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.janda.org/workshop/content%20analysis/kwic.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It was a useful indexing method for technical manuals before computerized [[full text search]] became common.

For example, a search query including all of the words in the title statement of this article ("KWIC is an acronym for Key Word In Context, the most common format for concordance lines") and the [[Wikipedia:Slogans|Wikipedia slogan]] in English ("the free encyclopedia"), searched against this very web page, might yield a KWIC index as follows. A KWIC index usually uses a wide layout to allow the display of maximum 'in context' information (not shown in the following example).

A KWIC index is a special case of a ''permuted index''.&lt;ref&gt;http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/lang/python/examples/kwic/web/theory.html&lt;/ref&gt; This term refers to the fact that it indexes all [[cyclic permutation]]s of the headings. Books composed of many short sections with their own descriptive headings, most notably collections of [[Manual page (Unix)|manual pages]], often ended with a '''permuted index''' section, allowing the reader to easily find a section by any word from its heading. This practice, also known as '''KWOC''' (“'''Key Word Out of Context'''”), is no longer common.

The Concordance of the Roman Missal is produced in both the KWIC and KWICn formats and is noteworthy in that each word form is listed as it appears in the text, that is, it is un-lemmatized."

London &amp; New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;, a new psychological theory of [[consciousness]], and leader of the [[Vygotsky Circle]] (also referred to as "Vygotsky-[[Alexander Luria|Luria]] Circle").

Despite his claim for a "new psychology" that he foresaw as a "science of the Superman" of the [[Communism|Communist future]], Vygotsky's main work was in [[developmental psychology]] and he proposed a theory of the development of "higher psychological functions" that saw human psychological development as emerging through interpersonal connections and actions with the social environment. During an earlier [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] and [[Reductionism|reductionist]] "instrumental psychology" period of his career (1920s), he argued that human psychological development can be formed through the use of meaningless (i.e., virtually random) signs that he viewed as psychological equivalent of instrument use in human labor and industry.&lt;ref name="revBook"/&gt; Later, in the "[[Holism|holistic]]" period of his career (first half of 1930s), Vygotsky rejected his earlier reductionist views on signs. Under the increasing influence from the holistic thinking of the scholars primarily associated with German-American [[Gestalt psychology]] movement Vygotsky adopted their views on "psychological systems" and—inspired by [[Kurt Lewin]]'s "[[Field theory (psychology)|Topological (and vector) psychology]]"—introduced the vague notion of the "[[zone of proximal development]]". It was during this period that he identified play of young children as their "leading activity", that he understood as the main source of preschoolers psychological development, which he viewed as the inseparable unity of emotional, volitional, and cognitive development. 

As early as in mid-1920s, Vygotsky's ideas were introduced in the West, but he remained virtually unknown until the early 1980s when the popularity among educators of the developmental psychology of [[Jean Piaget]] (1896-1980) started to decline and, in contrast, Vygotsky's notion of the "zone of proximal development" became a central component of the development of the so-called "[[Social constructivism|social constructivist]]" turn in developmental and, primarily, educational psychology and practice. A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' study, published in 2002, ranked Vygotsky as the 83rd top psychologist of the twentieth century and the third (and the last) Russian on the top-100 list after [[Ivan Pavlov]] and Vygotsky's longtime collaborator [[Alexander Luria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haggbloom |first=Steven J. |last2=''et al.'' |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=139–152 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug02/eminent.aspx |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary L. |last6=Russell |first6=Tenea M. |last7=Borecky |first7=Chris M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=Reagan |last9=Powell |first9=John L., III| displayauthors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early twenty-first century has seen scholarly reevaluations of the popular version of Vygotsky's legacy (sometimes termed "Vygotsky cult", "the cult of Vygotsky", or even "the cult of personality around Vygotsky"), which is referred to as the "revisionist revolution in Vygotsky Studies".&lt;ref name="revBook"&gt;Yasnitsky, A. &amp; van der Veer, R.

The studies conducted in the framework of the "revisionist turn" in Vygotsky studes in the decade of 2010s revealed not only systematic and massive falsifications and distortions of Vygotsky's legacy, but also demonstrated rapid decrease of this author's popularity in international scholarship that started in 2016-2017 and the downfall even further accelerated in 2018у&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=djqLs50AAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=djqLs50AAAAJ:umqufdRvDiIC Michael Cole’s (and Lev Vygotsky’s) ''Mind in society'' (1978): Google Scholar citation rate]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://psyanimajournal.livejournal.com/15934.html psyanimajournal: ''Vygotsky Bubble in 2017: The Year of the Great Break!'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://psyanimajournal.livejournal.com/16496.html psyanimajournal: ''Vygotsky Cult in figures and the Vygotsky Bubble: the 3rd Anniversary of the project!'']&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Biography==
Lev Vygotsky was born to the Vygodskii family in the town of [[Orsha]], [[Belarus]] (then belonging to [[Russian Empire]]) into a non-religious middle-class family of [[Russian Jews|Russian Jewish]] extraction. His father Simkha Vygodskii was a banker. Young Lev Vygodskii was raised in the city of [[Gomel]], where he was homeschooled until 1911 and then obtained formal degree (with distinction) in a private Jewish Gimnasium, which allowed him entrance to a university. In 1913 Lev Vygodskii was admitted to the [[Moscow University]] by mere ballot through a "[[Jewish quota#Countries legislating limitations on the admission of Jewish students|Jewish Lottery]]": at the time a three percent Jewish student quota was administered for entry in Moscow and Saint Petersburg universities. He had interest in humanities and social sciences, but at the insistence of his parents he applied to the medical school in Moscow University. During the first semester of study he transferred to the law school. There he studied law and, in parallel, he attended lectures at fully official, but privately funded and non degree granting Shaniavskii [[:ru:Московский городской народный университет имени А. Л. Шанявского|Moscow City People's University]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Shaniavskii+University Shaniavskii University]&lt;/ref&gt; His early interests were in the arts and, primarily, in the topics of the history of the Jewish people, the tradition, culture and Jewish identity. In contrast, during this period he was highly critical of the ideas of both [[socialism]] and [[Zionism]], and proposed the solution of the "Jewish question" by return to the traditional Jewish Orthodoxy.

Lev Vygodskii never completed his formal studies at the [[Imperial Moscow University]] and, thus, he never obtained a university degree: his studies were interrupted by the October Bolshevik uprising in 1917 in the country's capital Petrograd and the second largest city Moscow. Following these events, he left Moscow and eventually returned to Gomel, where he lived after the [[October Revolution|October Socialist Revolution]] of 1917 occurred. There is virtually no information about his life during the years in Gomel (that administratively belonged to the [[Ukrainian State]] at the time) after the German occupation during the [[WWI]], until the Bolsheviks captured the town in 1919. Since then he was an active participant of major social transformation under the Bolshevik (Communist) rule and a fairly prominent representative of the Bolshevik government in Gomel from 1919 to 1923. By the early 1920s, as reflected in his journalistic publications of the time, he informally changed his Jewish-sounding birth name, 'Lev Símkhovich Výgodskii' ({{lang-rus|Лев Си́мхович Вы́годский}}), with the surname becoming ''Vygótskii'' and the [[Russian patronymic|patronymic]] 'Símkhovich' becoming the Slavic 'Semiónovich'. It was under this pen-name that the fame subsequently came to him. His daughters (subsequently born in 1925 and 1930)  and other relatives, though, preserved their original family name 'Vygodskii'. The traditional English spelling of his last name nowadays is 'Vygotsky'.&lt;ref name="bioBook"/&gt;

In January 1924, Vygotsky took part in the Second All-Russian Psychoneurological Congress in [[Petrograd]] (soon thereafter renamed [[Leningrad]]). After the Congress, Vygotsky received an invitation to become a research fellow at the Psychological Institute in Moscow. Vygotsky moved to Moscow with his new wife, Roza Smekhova. He began his career at the Psychological Institute as a "staff scientist, second class".&lt;ref&gt;Van der Veer, R., &amp; Valsiner, J. (1991). [https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/10170 Understanding Vygotsky. A quest for synthesis]. Oxford: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1925, Vygotsky completed his dissertation in 1925 entitled, "The Psychology of Art", that was not published until the 1960s and a book entitled, "Pedagogical Psychology", that apparently was created on the basis of lecture notes that he prepared in Gomel while he was a psychology instructor at local educational establishments. In summer 1925 he made his first and only trip abroad to a London congress on the education of the deaf.&lt;ref&gt;van der Veer, R. &amp; Zavershneva, E. (2011).

After his release from hospital Vygotsky did theoretical and methodological work on the crisis in psychology, but never finished the draft of the manuscript and interrupted his work on it around mid-1927. The manuscript was published later with notable editorial interventions and distortions in 1982 and presented by the editors as one of the most important Vygotsky's works.&lt;ref name="Zavershneva, E 2009"&gt;Zavershneva, E. 2009.

Vygotsky. ''Journal of Russian and East European Psychology'', vol. 50, no. 4, July–August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In this early manuscript, Vygotsky argued for the formation of a general psychology that could unite the naturalist objectivist strands of psychological science with the more philosophical approaches of Marxist orientation. However, he also harshly criticized those of his colleagues who attempted to build a "[[Marxism|Marxist]] Psychology" as an alternative to the naturalist and philosophical schools. He argued that if one wanted to build a truly Marxist Psychology, there were no shortcuts to be found by merely looking for applicable quotes in the writings of [[Karl Marx|Marx]]. Rather one should look for a methodology that was in accordance with the Marxian spirit.&lt;ref name="Kozulin1986"&gt;Kozulin, Alex. 1986. "Vygotsky in Context" in Vygotsky L. "Thought and Language", MIT Press. pp. xi - lvii&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926-30 Vygotsky worked on a research programme investigating the development of higher cognitive functions of logical memory, selective attention, decision making, and language comprehension, from early forms of primal psychological functions. During this period he gathered a group of collaborators including [[Alexander Luria]], Boris Varshava, [[Alexei Leontiev]], [[Leonid Zankov]], and several others. Vygotsky guided his students in researching this phenomenon from three different perspectives: 
* The instrumental approach, which tried to understand the ways humans use objects as mediation aids in memory and reasoning
*A developmental approach, focused on how children acquire higher cognitive functions during development
* A culture-historical approach, studying how social and cultural patterns of interaction shape forms of mediation and developmental trajectories &lt;ref name="Kozulin1986"/&gt;

In the early 1930s Vygotsky experienced deep crisis, personal and theoretical, and after a period of massive self-criticism made an attempt at a radical revision of his theory. The work of the representatives of the [[Gestalt psychology]] and other holistic scholars was instrumental in this theoretical shift. In 1932-1934 Vygotsky was aiming at establishing a psychological theory of consciousness, but because of his death this theory remained only in a very sketchy and unfinished form.

==Life and scientific legacy==
Vygotsky was a pioneering psychologist and his major works span six separate volumes, written over roughly ten years, from ''Psychology of Art'' (1925) to ''Thought and Language'' [or ''Thinking and Speech''] (1934). Vygotsky's interests in the fields of [[developmental psychology]], [[child development]], and [[education]] were extremely diverse. His philosophical framework includes interpretations of the cognitive role of mediation tools, as well as the re-interpretation of well-known concepts in psychology such as [[internalization]] of knowledge. Vygotsky introduced the notion of [[zone of proximal development]], a metaphor capable of describing the potential of human cognitive development. His work covered topics such as the origin and the [[psychology of art]], development of higher [[mental function]]s, [[philosophy of science]] and the [[Methodology|methodology of psychological research]], the relation between [[learning]] and [[Developmental psychology|human development]], concept formation, interrelation between [[language and thought]] development, play as a psychological phenomenon, [[learning disabilities]], and abnormal human development (aka ''defectology''). His scientific thinking underwent several major transformations throughout his career, but generally Vygotsky's legacy may be divided into two fairly distinct periods,{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} and the transitional phase between the two during which Vygotsky experienced the crisis in his theory and personal life. These are the [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] "instrumental" period of the 1920s, integrative "[[Holism|holistic]]" period of the 1930s, and the transitional years of, roughly, 1929-1931. Each of these periods is characterized by its distinct themes and theoretical innovations.

==="Instrumental" period (1920s)===

====Cultural mediation and internalization====
Vygotsky studied child development and the significant roles of [[cultural mediation]] and [[interpersonal communication]]. He observed how higher mental functions developed through these interactions, and also represented the shared knowledge of a culture. This process is known as [[internalization]]. ''Internalization'' may be understood in one respect as "knowing how". For example, the practices of riding a bicycle or pouring a cup of milk initially, are outside and beyond the child. The mastery of the skills needed for performing these practices occurs through the activity of the child within society. A further aspect of internalization is ''appropriation'', in which children take tools and adapt them to personal use, perhaps using them in unique ways. Internalizing the use of a pencil allows the child to use it very much for personal ends rather than drawing exactly what others in society have drawn previously.

===The period of crisis, criticism, and self-criticism (1929–1932)===

In 1930s Vygotsky was engaged in massive reconstruction of his theory of his "instrumental" period of the 1920s. Around 1929-1930 he realized numerous deficiencies and imperfections of the earlier work of the Vygotsky Circle and criticized it on a number of occasions: in 1929,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. self-criticism of 1929: "I am revising the s[econd] part of "monkey"[i.e., the book Ape, primitive, and child]. Alas! The f[irst] chapter is written wholly according to the Freudianists [...]; then the impenetrable Piaget is turned into an absolute beyond all measure; instrument and sign are mixed together even more, and so on and so forth. This is not the fault of A. R. [Luria] personally, but of the entire "epoch" of our thinking. We need to put a stop to this unrelentingly. [...] Let there be the most rigorous, monastic regime of thought; ideological seclusion, if necessary. And let us demand the same of others. Let us explain that studying cultural psychology is no joke, not something to do at odd moments or among other things, and not grounds for every new person’s own conjectures".

Their structure and the system of their development remain the same. What is changed and modified are rather the relationships, the links between the functions.

Luria, from Moscow, June 12, 1931: "I am still beset with thousands of petty chores. The fruitlessness of what I do greatly distresses me. My scientific thinking is going off into the realm of fantasy, and I cannot think things through in a realistic way to the end.

'''Now''' I understand all this more deeply" (Zavershneva, 2010b, p. 54)&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Vygotsky criticized his earlier idea of radical separation between the "lower" and "higher" psychological functions and, around 1932, appears to abandon it.&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky in his presentation of December, 1932, a year and half before his death: "1. The necessity of a new stage of inquiry does not stem from the fact that a new thought has occurred to me or a new idea has caught my interest, but from the necessity of developing the research itself—new facts prod me into searching for new and more intricate explanations. The narrowness, bias, and schematism of the old mindset led us to the wrong assessment of the essential principles that we mistook for the secondary ones: interfunctional connections. We focused attention on the sign (on the tool) to the detriment of the operation with it, representing it as something simple, which goes through three phases: magical—external—internal. But the knot is external  and the teenager’s diary is external. Hence we have a sea of poorly explained facts and a desire to delve more deeply into the facts, i.e., to evaluate them theoretically in a different way.
2. The higher and lower functions are not constructed in two tiers: their number and names do not match. But our previous understanding was not right, either[, according to which] a higher function is the mastery of the lower ([e.g.,] voluntary attention is the subordination to it of involuntary attention) because this means exactly—in two tiers". Vygotsky’s record titled "Symposium, December 4, 1932", see in Zavershneva, E. 2010b. The Vygotsky Family Archive: New Findings. Notebooks, Notes, and Scientific Journals of L.S. Vygotsky (1912–1934). ''Journal of the Russian and East European Psychology'' 48 (1):34-60, pp. 41-42&lt;/ref&gt;

Vygotsky's self-criticism was complemented by external criticism for a number of issues, including the separation between the "higher" and the "lower" psychological functions, impracticality and inapplicability of his theory in social practices (such as industry or education) during the time of rapid social change, and vulgar Marxist interpretation of human psychological processes. Critics also pointed to his overemphasis on the role of language and, on the other hand, the ignorance of the emotional factors in human development. Major figures in Soviet psychology such as [[Sergei Rubinstein]] criticized Vygotsky's notion of mediation and its development in the works of students. Following criticism and in response to generous offer from the highest officials in Soviet Ukraine, a major group of Vygotsky's associates, the members of the [[Vygotsky Circle]], including [[Alexander Luria|Luria]], [[Mark Lebedinsky]], and [[Aleksei N. Leontiev|Leontiev]], moved from Moscow to Ukraine to establish the [[Kharkov School of Psychology|Kharkov school of psychology]]. In the second half of the 1930s, Vygotsky was criticized again for his involvement in the cross-disciplinary study of the child known as [[paedology]] and uncritical borrowings from contemporary "bourgeois" science. Considerable critique came from the alleged Vygotsky's followers, such as Leontiev and members of his research group in Kharkov. Much of this early criticism was later discarded by these Vygotskian scholars as well.

==="Holistic" period (1932–1934)===

The period of major revision of Vygotsky's theory and its transition from mechanist orientation of his 1920s to integrative holistic science of the 1930s. During this period Vygotsky was under particularly strong influence of holistic theories of German-American group of proponents of [[Gestalt psychology]], most notably, the peripheral participants of the Gestalt movement [[Kurt Goldstein]] and [[Kurt Lewin]]. However, Vygotsky's work of this period remained largely fragmentary and unfinished and, therefore, unpublished.

====Zone of proximal development====
"[[Zone of proximal development]]" (ZPD) is Vygotsky's term for the range of tasks that a child is in the process of learning to complete. In the original Vygotsky's writings this phrase is used in three different meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Kozulin, A. (2014). Dynamic assessment in search of its identity in Yasnitsky, A., van der Veer, R., &amp; Ferrari, M. (Eds.). (2014). The Cambridge Handbook of Cultural-Historical Psychology. Cambridge University Press (pp. 126-147)&lt;/ref&gt; Vygotsky viewed the ZPD as a better way to explain the relation between children’s learning and cognitive development. Prior to the ZPD, the relation between learning and development could be boiled down to the following three major positions: 1) Development always precedes learning (e.g., [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]]): children first need to meet a particular maturation level before learning can occur; 2) Learning and development cannot be separated, but instead occur simultaneously (e.g., [[behaviorism]]): essentially, learning is development; and 3) learning and development are separate, but interactive processes (e.g., [[gestaltism]]): one process always prepares the other process, and vice versa. Vygotsky rejected these three major theories because he believed that learning should always precede development in the ZPD. According to Vygotsky, through the assistance of a more capable person, a child is able to learn skills or aspects of a skill that go beyond the child’s actual developmental or maturational level. The lower limit of ZPD is the level of skill reached by the child working independently (also referred to as the child's developmental level). The upper limit is the level of potential skill that the child is able to reach with the assistance of a more capable instructor. In this sense, the ZPD provides a prospective view of cognitive development, as opposed to a retrospective view that characterizes development in terms of a child’s independent capabilities.

====''Thinking and speech''====
Perhaps Vygotsky's most important contribution concerns the inter-relationship of language development and thought. This problem was explored in Vygotsky's book, ''Thinking and speech'', entitled in Russian, ''Myshlenie i rech'', that was published in 1934. In fact, this book was a mere collection of essays and scholarly papers that Vygotsky wrote during different periods of his thought development and included writings of his "instrumental" and "holistic" periods. Vygotsky never saw the book published: it was published posthumously, edited by his closest associates (Kolbanovskii, Zankov, and Shif) not sooner than December, 1934, i.e., half a year after his death. First English translation was published in 1962 (with several later revised editions) heavily abbreviated and under an alternative and incorrect translation of the title ''Thought and Language'' for the Russian title ''Mysl' i iazyk''. The book establishes the explicit and profound connection between speech (both silent inner speech and oral language), and the development of mental concepts and cognitive awareness. Vygotsky described inner speech as being qualitatively different from verbal external speech. Although Vygotsky believed inner speech developed from external speech via a gradual process of "internalization" (i.e., transition from the external to the internal), with younger children only really able to "think out loud", he claimed that in its mature form, inner speech would not resemble spoken language as we know it (in particular, being greatly compressed). Hence, thought itself developing socially.

===Death (1934) and posthumous fame===
Vygotsky died of [[tuberculosis]] on June 11, 1934, at the age of 37, in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]]. One of Vygotsky's last private notebook entries gives a proverbial, yet very pessimistic self-assessment of his contribution to psychological theory:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the final thing I have done in psychology – and I will like [[Moses]] die at the summit, having glimpsed the promised land but without setting foot on it. Farewell, dear creations. The rest is silence.&lt;ref name="revBook"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Immediately after his death, Vygotsky was proclaimed one of the leading psychologists in the Soviet Union, although his stellar reputation was somewhat undermined by the decree of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 1936 that denounced the mass movement, discipline, and related social practice of the so-called [[Pedology (children study)|pedology]]. Yet, even despite some criticisms and censorship of his works—most notably, in the post-Stalin era in the Soviet Union of 1960s-1980s by his Russian alleged and self-proclaimed best students and followers—Vygotsky always remained among the most quoted scholars in the field and has become a [[Cult following|cult figure]] for a number of contemporary intellectuals and practitioners in Russia and the international psychological and educational community alike.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, J. &amp; Yasnitsky, A. (2015). [http://individual.utoronto.ca/yasnitsky/texts/Fraser%20&amp;%20Yasnitsky%20(2015).pdf Deconstructing Vygotsky’s Victimization Narrative: A Re-Examination of the "Stalinist Suppression" of Vygotskian Theory].

==Influence worldwide==

===Eastern Europe===
In the [[Soviet Union]], the work of the group of Vygotsky's students known as the [[Vygotsky Circle]] was vital for preserving and, in many respects, distorting the scientific legacy of Lev Vygotsky.&lt;ref name="Kozulin 1986 264–274"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kozulin|first=A.|title=The concept of activity in Soviet psychology: Vygotsky, his disciples and critics|journal=American Psychologist|year=1986|volume=41|issue=3|pages=264–274|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.41.3.264}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the group subsequently laid a foundation for Vygotskian psychology's systematic development in such diverse fields as the psychology of memory ([[Pyotr Zinchenko|P. Zinchenko]]), perception, sensation, and movement ([[Alexander Zaporozhets|Zaporozhets]], [[Vladimir Asnin|Asnin]], [[Alexei Nikolaevich Leont'ev|A. N. Leont'ev]]), personality (Lidiya Bozhovich, [[Vladimir Asnin|Asnin]], [[Alexei Nikolaevich Leont'ev|A. N. Leont'ev]]), will and volition ([[Alexander Zaporozhets|Zaporozhets]], [[Alexei Nikolaevich Leont'ev|A. N. Leont'ev]], [[Pyotr Zinchenko|P. Zinchenko]], L. Bozhovich, [[Vladimir Asnin|Asnin]]), psychology of play (G. D. Lukov, Daniil El'konin) and psychology of learning ([[Pyotr Zinchenko|P. Zinchenko]], L. Bozhovich, D. El'konin), as well as the theory of step-by-step formation of mental actions (Pyotr Gal'perin), general psychological [[activity theory]] ([[Alexei Nikolaevich Leont'ev|A. N. Leont'ev]]) and psychology of action ([[Alexander Zaporozhets|Zaporozhets]]).&lt;ref name="Kozulin 1986 264–274"/&gt; Andrey Puzyrey elaborated the ideas of Vygotsky in respect of psychotherapy and even in the broader context of deliberate [[psychological intervention]] (psychotechnique), in general.&lt;ref name=Puzyrey&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vassilieva|first=J.|title=Russian psychology at the turn of the 21st century and post-Soviet reforms in the humanities disciplines|journal=History of Psychology|year=2010|volume=13|issue=2|pages=138–159|doi=10.1037/a0019270}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Laszlo Garai]] &lt;ref&gt;:Interview with Laszlo Garai on the Activity Theory of Alexis Leontiev and his own Theory of Social Identity as referred to the meta-theory of Lev Vygotsky. ''Journal of Russian and East European Psychology'' 2012; vol. 50, no. 1, pp. 50–64.&lt;/ref&gt; founded a Vygotskian research group.

===North America===
In North America, Vygotsky's work was known from the end of the 1920s through a series of publications in English, but it did not have a major impact on research in general. In 1962 a translation of his posthumous 1934 book, ''Thinking and Speech'', published with the title,''Thought and Language'', did not seem to change the situation considerably. It was only after an eclectic compilation of partly rephrased and partly translated works of Vygotsky and his collaborators, published in 1978 under Vygotsky's name as ''Mind in Society'', that the Vygotsky boom started in the West: originally, in North America, and later, following the North American example, spread to other regions of the world. This version of Vygotskian science is typically associated with the names of its chief proponents Michael Cole, [[James Wertsch]], their associates and followers, and is relatively well-known under the names of "[[cultural-historical activity theory]]" (aka CHAT) or—yet more distant from Vygotsky's legacy--"[[activity theory]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roth|first=W.M.|author2=Lee, J.Y. |title="Vygotsky's Neglected Legacy": Cultural Historical Activity Theory|journal=Review of Educational Research|date=June 2007|volume=77|issue=2|doi=10.3102/0034654306298273|pages=186–232|url=http://lchc.ucsd.edu/MCA/Mail/xmcamail.2007_06.dir/att-0021/Wolff-Michael_Roth_Vygotsky.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="toomela1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Toomela | first1 = A | year = 2000 | title = Activity theory is a dead end for cultural-historical psychology | url = | journal = Culture &amp; Psychology | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 353–364 | doi=10.1177/1354067x0063005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  name="toomela2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Toomela | first1 = A | year = 2008 | title = Activity theory is a dead end for methodological thinking in cultural psychology too | url = | journal = Culture &amp; Psychology | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 289–303 | doi=10.1177/1354067x08088558}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Instructional scaffolding|Scaffolding]], a concept introduced by Wood, [[Jerome Bruner|Bruner]], and Ross in 1976, is somewhat related to the idea of ZPD, although Vygotsky never used the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = D.

==Criticisms of North American "Vygotskian" and original Vygotsky's legacy==
A critique of the North American interpretation of Vygotsky's ideas and, somewhat later, its global spread and dissemination appeared in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Valsiner, J. (1988). Developmental psychology in the Soviet Union. Brighton, Sussex: Harvester Press, p. 117: Present-day psychologists’ interest in Vygotsky’s thinking is indeed paradoxical. On the one hand, his writings seem increasingly popular among developmental psychologists in Europe and North America. On the other hand, however, careful analyses and thorough understanding of the background of Vygotsky’s ideas is rare... Vygotsky seems to be increasingly well known in international psychology, while remaining little understood. The roots of his thinking in international philosophical and psychological discourse remain largely hidden. His ideas have rarely been developed further, along either theoretical or empirical lines.&lt;/ref&gt; The early 1980s criticism of Russian and Western "Vygotskian" scholars &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simon | first1 = J | year = 1987 | title = Vygotsky and the Vygotskians | url = | journal = American Journal of Education | volume = 95 | issue = 4| pages = 609–613 }}&lt;/ref&gt; continued throughout the 1990s. Thus, different authors emphasized the biased and fragmented interpretations of Vygotsky by representatives of what was termed "neo-Vygotskian fashions in contemporary psychology"&lt;ref&gt;Van der Veer, R., and J. Valsiner. 1991. Understanding Vygotsky: A quest for synthesis. Oxford: Blackwell, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; or "selective traditions" in Vygotskian scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Cazden, C. B. 1996. Selective traditions: Readings of Vygotsky in writing pedagogy. In Child discourse and social learning: An interdisciplinary perspective, edited by D. Hicks, 165-186. New York: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristically, the most fashionable "Vygotskian" phraseology in wide circulation in Western scholarly and educational discourse—such as the so-called "[[zone of proximal development]]"—in the critical literature of this period were referred to as "one of the most used and least understood constructs to appear in contemporary educational literature",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Palincsar | first1 = A.

Other authors also suggest clearly distinguishing between Vygotsky's original notion of "zona blizhaishego razvitiia" (''ZBR'') and its later Western superficial interpretations known under the umbrella term, "zone of proximal development" (''ZPD'').&lt;ref&gt;Valsiner, J., &amp; Van der Veer, R.

Renninger (Eds.), The development and meaning of psychological distance (pp. 35-62). Hillsdale, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valsiner, J., &amp; van der Veer, R. (2014).

Ferrari (Eds.), ''The Cambridge Handbook of Cultural-Historical Psychology''. (pp. 148-174). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism continued and reached a peak in the 2000s. Most often these critiques address numerous distortions of Vygotsky's ideas, mere "declarations of faith",&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Valsiner, J., and R. Van der Veer (2000). The social mind: Construction of the idea. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p.4: It is often an open question as to what functions such declarations can have in science. From a position of in-depth analysis, such statements seem merely to be stating the obvious (compared with the statements like the rain is wet or the rich are affluent). And yet, such general claims about the sociality of the human psyche are made with remarkable vigour and repetitiveness&lt;/ref&gt; "versions of Vygotsky",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gillen | first1 = J | year = 2000 | title = Versions of Vygotsky | url = | journal = British Journal of Educational Studies | volume = 48 | issue = 2| pages = 183–98 | doi=10.1111/1467-8527.t01-1-00141}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "concepts and inferences curiously attributed to Lev Vygotsky",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gredler | first1 = M.

Critical analysis of Vygotsky's ideas revealed that the alleged "Vygotsky's theory of play" never existed as such: instead, it was proposed that "Vygotsky's brief writings about play do not constitute a theory according to scientific definitions of psychological theory, and would be better acknowledged merely as part of the historical evolution of ideas about children's play. Of greater significance is that the theoretical relevance of Vygotsky's opinion about play can seriously be called into question upon the basis of current research in the area".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=E.

==Revisionist movement in Vygotsky Studies==
The revisionist movement in Vygotsky Studies was termed a "revisionist revolution"&lt;ref name="revBook"/&gt; to describe a relatively recent trend that emerged in the 1990s. This trend is typically associated with growing dissatisfaction with the quality and scholarly integrity of available texts of Vygotsky and members of [[Vygotsky Circle]], including their English translations made from largely mistaken, distorted, and even in a few instances falsified Soviet editions,&lt;ref&gt;Veer, R., van der (1997).

Thus, some studies of the revisionist strand show that certain phrases, terms, and expressions typically associated with Vygotskian legacy as its core notions and concepts—such as "cultural-historical psychology", "cultural-historical theory", "cultural-historical school", "higher psychical/mental functions", "internalization", "zone of proximal development", etc., -- in fact, either occupy not more than just a few dozen pages within the six-volume collection of Vygotsky’s works,&lt;ref&gt;Tudge, J. 1999.

==''Complete Works of L. S. Vygotsky''==
Scholars associated with the [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] movement in Vygotsky Studies propose returning to Vygotsky's original uncensored works, critically revising the available discourse, and republishing them in both Russian and translation with a rigorous scholarly commentary.&lt;ref name="html"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Veer, R., van der (2010). Vygotsky in English: What still needs to be done. Website for International Cultural Historical Studies (http://www.ichs.udk.-berlin.de{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, an essential part of this revisionist strand is the ongoing work on "''PsyAnima'' Complete Vygotsky" project&lt;ref&gt;[http://psyanimajournal.livejournal.com/ psyanimajournal]: [http://psyanimajournal.livejournal.com/3526.html PsyAnima Полное собрание сочинений Выготского / PsyAnima Complete Vygotsky]&lt;/ref&gt; that for the first time ever exposes full collections of Vygotsky's texts, uncensored and cleared from numerous mistakes, omissions, insertions, and blatant distortions and falsifications of the author's text made in Soviet editions and uncritically transferred in virtually all foreign translated editions of Vygotsky's works. This project is carried out by an international team of volunteers—researchers, archival workers, and library staff—from Belarus, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, and Switzerland, who joined their efforts and put together a collection of L. S. Vygotsky’s texts. This publication work is supported by a stream of critical scholarly studies and publications on textology, history, theory and methodology of Vygotskian research that cumulatively contributes to the first ever edition of ''The Complete Works of L.S. Vygotsky''.&lt;ref&gt;Yasnitsky, A. (2012). [http://www.psyanima.su/journal/2012/3/2012n3a6/2012n3a6.2.pdf The Complete Works of L.S.

[[Computability theory]] is the part of the theory of [[computation]] that deals with what can be computed, in principle. [[Computational complexity theory]] deals with how hard computations are, in quantitative terms, both with upper bounds ([[algorithm]]s whose complexity in the worst cases, as use of computing resources, can be estimated), and from below (proofs that no procedure to carry out some task can be very fast).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6496">{{distinguish|text = [[Map of Tendre]] or the love maps in ''[[The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work]]''}}

A '''lovemap''' is a person's internal blueprint for their ideal erotic situations. The concept was originated by sexologist [[John Money]] in his discussions of how people develop their sexual preferences. Money defined it as "a developmental representation or template in the mind and in the brain depicting the idealized lover and the idealized program of sexual and erotic activity projected in imagery or actually engaged in with that lover."{{sfn|Money|1986|p=290}}

== History ==
John Money first wrote the word ''lovemap'' in 1980 for an article later published under the title "Pairbonding and [[Limerence]]". Prior to that, Money discussed lovemaps in a precursory form with his students in lectures, employing the term as a replacement for the expression, "an idealized and highly idiosyncratic image."{{sfn|Money|1986|p = xv-xvi}} In a 1997 review article, Money revisited  the concept of 'love map' and expanded it to three categories, ''haptoerotic'' (cutaneous), ''morphoerotic'' (visual) and ''gnomoerotic'' (narrative).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Money, J. | year = 1997 | title = Evolutionary sexology: the hypothesis of song and sex | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 48 | issue = 5 | pages = 399–402 | doi=10.1016/s0306-9877(97)90035-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, the concept of "love maps", applied to [[interpersonal relationships]], has found some acceptance and is frequently referenced in books about love and sexuality.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} [[Glenn Wilson (psychologist)|Glenn Wilson]] and Chris McLaughlin discussed it in their 2001 book ''The Science of Love''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wilson, G.D.  |author2=McLaughlin, C.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Science of Love|location=Great Britain | publisher=Fusion Press|year=2001|isbn=1-901250-54-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development and expression ==
Money describes the formation of an individual's lovemap as similar to the acquisition of a native language, in that it becomes established at an early age{{sfn|Money|1986|p = 14}} and bears the mark of the person's unique individuality, like an accent in a spoken language.{{sfn|Money|1986|p = 19}} According to Money, lovemaps are not present at birth, but begin to develop shortly thereafter, and manifest in full after puberty.{{sfn|Money|1986|p=xvi}} The individual may not discover certain aspects of their lovemap until triggered by a relevant experience (such as pornography use) later in life.{{sfn|Lehne|2009|p = 16}}

Psychologist Gregory Lehne states that lovemaps may be influenced by genetic or prenatal factors, but that their specific content must come from the senses.{{sfn|Lehne|2009|p = 14}} Lehne says that some perceptions are encoded in the person's lovemap after becoming sexualized for uncertain reasons, possibly because of their [[Association (psychology)|associations]] with provoked or random [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] [[arousal]], [[sexual arousal]], or hormonal fluctuations.{{sfn|Lehne|2009|p = 14}} These associations typically form during experiences before the age of eight, Money proposes.{{sfn|Lehne|2009|p = 15}}{{sfn|Money|1986|p=19}} As an example, Lehne argues that a child who accidentally becomes sexually aroused during [[spanking]] may go on to develop an interest in [[erotic spanking]].{{sfn|Lehne|2009|p = 15}} Once formed, the lovemap is extremely difficult to alter.{{sfn|Money|1986|p=19}}

A lovemap is usually quite specific as to details of the physiognomy, build, race, color, temperament, and manner of the ideal lover.{{sfn|Money|1986|p = 19}} Money suggests that love is like an [[ink blot test]], where pair-bonding occurs if projections (shaped by a person's lovemap) on the other are mutual, typically in a courtship phase of mating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Money|first=John|title=Gay, Straight, and In-Between: The Sexology of Erotic Orientation|year=1988|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-505407-5|pages=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==
Money analyzed a large range of sexual predilections and behaviors using his model of the "lovemap".  In his book on the subject, some of the most notable concepts include:{{sfn|Money|1986}}

*[[Heterosexual]] lovemaps – love mappings associative to persons of the opposite gender.{{sfn|Money|1986|p=xvi}}
*[[Homosexual]] lovemaps – love mappings associative to persons of the same gender.
*Vandalized lovemaps –  According to Money, these occur when the love mapping process becomes traumatized, as when a young child is either exposed to, or forced to participate in such inappropriate behaviors as [[child sexual abuse]], incest, or sexual sado-masochism.{{sfn|Money|1986|p=17-19}} He states that such a lovemap is typically formed between the ages of five and eight.{{sfn|Money|1986|p=19}} A vandalized lovemap may be paraphilic or hyposexual.{{sfn|Money|1986|p=19}}
*[[paraphilia|Paraphilic]] lovemaps – when lust is attached to fantasies and practices that are socially forbidden, disapproved, ridiculed, or penalized.{{sfn|Money|1986|p=19}} According to Money, it can result from lust being displaced from a "vandalized" area of an ordinary lovemap following abuse.{{sfn|Money|1986|p=19}} Alternatively, Money suggests that a paraphilic lovemap could arise from a non-sexual childhood experience that induced genital arousal in the child.{{sfn|Money|1986|p=20}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15562">'''Microbial biogeography''' is a subset of [[biogeography]], a field that concerns the distribution of organisms across space and time.&lt;ref name = "lomolino"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Mark V. Lomolino, Brett R. Riddle, Robert J. Whittaker, James H.|title=Biogeography|date=2010|publisher=Sinauer Associates|location=Sunderland, Mass.|isbn=9780878934942|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although biogeography traditionally focused on plants and larger animals, recent studies have broadened this field to include distribution patterns of [[microorganisms]]. This extension of biogeography to smaller scales—known as "microbial biogeography"—is enabled by ongoing advances in genetic technologies.

The aim of microbial biogeography is to reveal where microorganisms live, at what abundance, and why. Microbial biogeography can therefore provide insight into the underlying mechanisms that generate and hinder [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name = "martiny"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martiny|first1=Jennifer B.

==History==
[[Schewiakoff]] (1893) theorized about the cosmopolitan habitat of free-living protozoans.&lt;ref&gt;Schewiakoff, W.T. 1893. Über die geographische Verbreitung der Süßwasser-protozoen. ''Mem. Acad. Imp. Sci. St. Petersb. Ser. VII'' 41, n. 8, 1-201, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/176385#page/771/mode/1up BHL].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, [[Lourens Baas Becking]], based on his own research in California's salt lakes, as well as work by others on salt lakes worldwide,&lt;ref name="Bass1934"&gt;Baas-Becking, L.G.M. (1934). ''Geobiologie of inleiding tot de milieukunde''. The Hague, the Netherlands: W.P. Van Stockum &amp; Zoon, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JpYLAQAAIAAJ]. English translation, 2015, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hx-dCgAAQBAJ].&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that "everything is everywhere, but the environment selects".&lt;ref&gt;Translated from the original Dutch: ''"Alles is overal: maar het milieu selecteert"''&lt;/ref&gt; Baas Becking attributed the first half of this hypothesis to his colleague [[Martinus Beijerinck]] (1913).&lt;ref name=staley193&gt;Staley, J. T. &amp; Gosink, J. J. (1999). Poles Apart: Biodiversity and Biogeography of Sea Ice Bacteria. ''Annual Review of Microbiology'' 53: 189-215, [http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.micro.53.1.189?journalCode=micro].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beijerinck, M.W. (1913) ''De infusies en de ontdekking der backteriën. Jaarboek van de Koninklijke Akademie voor Wetenschappen.'' Amsterdam, the Netherlands: Müller. (Reprinted in Verzamelde geschriften van M.W. Beijerinck, vijfde deel, pp. 119–140. Delft, 1921).&lt;/ref&gt;

Baas Becking hypothesis of cosmopolitan microbial distribution would later be challenged by other works.&lt;ref&gt;Kristiansen, J. (1996). ''Biogeography of Freshwater Algae''. Dev.

== Microbial vs macro-organism biogeography ==

The biogeography of macro-organisms (i.e., plants and animals that can be seen with the naked eye) has been studied since the eighteenth century. For macro-organisms, biogeographical patterns (i.e., which organism assemblages appear in specific places and times) appear to arise from both past and current environments. For example, [[polar bears]] live in the [[Arctic]] but not the [[Antarctic]], while the reverse is true for [[penguins]]; although both polar bears and penguins have adapted to cold climates over many generations (the result of past environments), the distance and warmer climates between the north and south poles prevent these species from spreading to the opposite hemisphere (the result of current environments). This demonstrates the biogeographical pattern known as "isolation with geographic distance" by which the limited ability of a species to physically disperse across space (rather than any [[Selection (biology)|selective]] genetic reasons) restricts the geographical range over which it can be found.

The biogeography of [[microorganism]]s (i.e., organisms that cannot be seen with the naked eye, such as fungi and bacteria) is an emerging field enabled by ongoing advancements in genetic technologies, in particular cheaper [[DNA sequencing]] with higher throughput that now allows analysis of global datasets on microbial biology at the molecular level. When scientists began studying microbial biogeography, they anticipated a lack of biogeographic patterns due to the high dispersibility and large population sizes of microbes, which were expected to ultimately render geographical distance irrelevant. Indeed, in microbial ecology the oft-repeated saying by [[Lourens Baas Becking]] that “everything is everywhere, but the environment selects” has come to mean that as long as the environment is [[ecologically]] appropriate, [[geological]] barriers are irrelevant.&lt;ref name = "omalley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Malley|first1=Maureen A.|title=The nineteenth century roots of 'everything is everywhere'|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|date=August 2007|volume=5|issue=8|pages=647–651|doi=10.1038/nrmicro1711|pmid=17603517}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent studies show clear evidence for biogeographical patterns in microbial life, which challenge this common interpretation: the existence of microbial biogeographic patterns disputes the idea that “everything is everywhere” while also supporting the idea that environmental selection includes geography as well as historical events that can leave lasting signatures on microbial communities.&lt;ref name = "martiny" /&gt;

Microbial biogeographic patterns are often similar to those of macro-organisms. Microbes generally follow well-known patterns such as the [[distance decay]] relationship, the [[Occupancy–abundance relationship|abundance-range]] relationship, and [[Rapoport's rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanson|first1=China A.|last2=Fuhrman|first2=Jed A.|last3=Horner-Devine|first3=M.

However, important differences between the biogeographical patterns of microorganism and macro-organism do exist, and likely result from differences in their underlying biogeographic processes (e.g., drift, [[biological dispersal|dispersal]], selection, and [[mutation]]). For example, dispersal is an important biogeographical process for both microbes and larger organisms, but small microbes can disperse across much greater ranges and at much greater speeds by traveling through the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] (for larger animals dispersal is much more constrained due to their size).&lt;ref name = "martiny" /&gt; As a result, many microbial species can be found in both northern and southern hemispheres, while larger animals are typically found only at one pole rather than both.&lt;ref name = "marine" &gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amend|first1=Anthony S.|last2=Oliver|first2=Tom A.|last3=Amaral-Zettler|first3=Linda A.|last4=Boetius|first4=Antje|last5=Fuhrman|first5=Jed A.|last6=Horner-Devine|first6=M.

== Distinct patterns ==

=== Reversed latitudinal diversity gradient ===
Larger organisms tend to exhibit [[latitudinal gradients in species diversity]], with larger biodiversity existing in the tropics and decreasing toward more temperate polar regions. In contrast, a study on indoor fungal communities&lt;ref name = "indoor" /&gt; found microbial biodiversity to be significantly higher in temperate zones than in the tropics. The same study found that drastically different buildings exhibited the same indoor fungal composition in any given location, where similarity increased with proximity. Thus despite human efforts to control indoor climates, outside environments appear to be the strongest determinant of indoor fungal composition.

=== Bipolar latitude distributions ===
Certain microbial populations exist in opposite hemispheres and at complementary latitudes. These ‘bipolar’ (or ‘antitropical’) distributions are much rarer in macro-organisms; although macro-organisms exhibit latitude gradients, ‘isolation by geographic distance’ prevents bipolar distributions (e.g., polar bears are not found at both poles). In contrast, a study on marine surface bacteria&lt;ref name = "marine" /&gt; showed not only a latitude gradient, but also complementarity distributions with similar populations at both poles, suggesting no "isolation by geographic distance". This is likely due to differences in the underlying biogeographic process, dispersal, as microbes tend to disperse at high rates and far distances by traveling through the atmosphere.

=== Seasonal variations ===
Microbial diversity can exhibit striking seasonal patterns at a single geographical location. This is largely due to dormancy, a microbial feature not seen in larger animals that allows microbial community composition to fluctuate in relative abundance of persistent species (rather than actual species present). This is known as the "seed-bank hypothesis"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lennon|first1=Jay T.|last2=Jones|first2=Stuart E.|title=Microbial seed banks: the ecological and evolutionary implications of dormancy|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|date=February 2011|volume=9|issue=2|pages=119–130|doi=10.1038/nrmicro2504|pmid=21233850}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has implications for our understanding of ecological resilience and thresholds to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Caporaso|first1=J Gregory|last2=Paszkiewicz|first2=Konrad|last3=Field|first3=Dawn|last4=Knight|first4=Rob|last5=Gilbert|first5=Jack A|title=The Western English Channel contains a persistent microbial seed bank|journal=The ISME Journal|date=10 November 2011|volume=6|issue=6|pages=1089–1093|doi=10.1038/ismej.2011.162|pmc=3358019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Directed panspermia ===
[[Panspermia]] suggests that life can be distributed throughout [[outer space]] via [[comets]], [[asteroids]], and [[meteoroids]].  Panspermia assumes that life can survive the harsh space environment, which features vacuum conditions, intense radiation, extreme temperatures, and a dearth of available nutrients. Many microorganisms are able to evade such stressors by forming [[spores]] or entering a state of low-metabolic dormancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roszak|first1=DB|last2=Colwell|first2=RR|title=Survival strategies of bacteria in the natural environment.|journal=Microbiological Reviews|date=September 1987|volume=51|issue=3|pages=365–79|pmid=3312987|pmc=373117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in microbial biogeography have even shown that the ability of microbes to enter and successfully emerge from dormancy when their respective environmental conditions are favorable contributes to the high levels of microbial biodiversity observed in almost all [[ecosystems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=S. E.|last2=Lennon|first2=J. T.|title=Dormancy contributes to the maintenance of microbial diversity|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=15 March 2010|volume=107|issue=13|pages=5881–5886|doi=10.1073/pnas.0912765107|pmid=20231463|pmc=2851880}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus microbial biogeography can be applied to panspermia as it predicts that microbes are able to protect themselves from the harsh space environment, know to emerge when conditions are safe, and also take advantage of their dormancy capability to enhance biodiversity wherever they may land.

[[Directed panspermia]] is the deliberate transport of microorganisms to colonize another [[planet]]. If aiming to colonize an Earth-like environment, microbial biogeography can inform decisions on the biological payload of such a mission. In particular, microbes exhibit latitudinal ranges according to [[Rapoport's rule]], which states that organisms living at lower [[latitudes]] (near the [[equator]]) are found within smaller latitude ranges than those living at higher [[latitudes]] (near the poles). Thus the ideal biological payload would include widespread, higher-latitude microorganisms that can tolerate of a wider range of climates. This is not necessarily the obvious choice, as these widespread organisms are also rare in microbial communities and tend to be weaker competitors when faced with [[endemic]] organisms. Still, they can survive in a range of climates and thus would be ideal for inhabiting otherwise lifeless Earth-like planets with uncertain environmental conditions. [[Extremophiles]], although tough enough to withstand the space environment, may not be ideal for directed panspermia as any given extremophile species requires a very specific climate to survive. However, if the target was closer to Earth, such as a planet or moon in our [[Solar System]], it may be possible to select a specific extremophile species for the well-defined target environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5614">'''Moderation theory''' is a set of interrelated hypotheses that explain the process through which political groups eschew radical platforms in favour of more moderate policies and prefer electoral, compromising and non-confrontational strategies over non-electoral, exclusive, and confrontational strategies. Moderation can take place at both ideological and behavioural levels that mutually reinforce each other.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The origins of the theory go back to the work of [[Robert Michels]] who offers a classical study of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] in his book ''[[Political Parties]]''.{{sfn|Alidina|2014|p=1}} The theory offers insights into the transformation of party politics in a great range of cultural and historical cases including socialist{{sfn|Przeworski|Sprague|1986}} and [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] parties{{sfn|Kalyvas|1996}} in Western Europe and more recently Islamic political groups.{{sfn|Tezcür|2010}} In particular, the evolution of Islamic [[political parties]] in Turkey since the early 1970s that culminated in the rise of the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] in the 2002 parliamentary elections exemplifies the dynamics highlighted by moderation theory.

The theory is composed of three causal mechanisms.{{sfn|Tezcür|2010|pp=27–32}} First, once radical political groups are organized as vote-seeking parties, electoral considerations prevail and these groups abandon revolutionary agendas in favour of vote-maximizing strategies. This expectation is based on the [[median voter theorem]]. A second mechanism concerns the vulnerability of radical political groups participating in electoral contest to state repression. The logic of political survival necessitates that these groups avoid openly confronting state elites. The final mechanism involves the effects of organizational resources on group behaviour and suggests that the maintenance of electoral organization is prioritized over original political goals. Once radicals are organized as electoral parties, their original projects of revolutionizing the 
political system becomes unachievable simply because of the lack of organizational resources. While moderation of radicals is generally thought to be conducive to [[democratization]], it can also hamper and even hinder democratic progress as radicals are co-opted into the ruling political system and lose their reformist characteristics.

In contemporary times, moderation theory is further developed and critically refined to understand the evolution of Islamic political parties in Muslim majority countries as diverse as Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, and [[Güneş Murat Tezcür|Turkey]]. The [[Al-Wasat Party|Center Party]] (''Hizb al-Wasat'') of Egypt is example of a moderate Islamic organization that was not given license by the ruling regime.{{sfn|Wickham|2004}} Moreover, [[Muslim Brotherhood]] of Egypt has transformed into an organization that is responsive to the logic of political competition and survival in an authoritarian regime at the cost of its original ideological commitments.{{sfn|El-Ghobashy|2005}} Similarly, the [[Islamic Action Front]] of Jordan shows that Islamists can be moderate as a result of participation in pluralistic political process as long as this participation can be justified in Islamic terms.{{sfn|Schwedler|2006}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25996">'''Nearest neighbor search''' ('''NNS'''), as a form of proximity search,  is the [[optimization problem]] of finding the point in a given set that is closest (or most similar) to a given point. Closeness is typically expressed in terms of a dissimilarity function: the less similar the objects, the larger the function values. Formally, the nearest-neighbor (NN) search problem is defined as follows: given a set ''S'' of points in a space ''M'' and a query point ''q''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''M'', find the closest point in ''S'' to ''q''. [[Donald Knuth]] in vol. 3 of ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'' (1973) called it the '''post-office problem''', referring to an application of assigning to a residence the nearest post office. A direct generalization of this problem is a ''k''-NN search, where we need to find the ''k'' closest points.

Most commonly ''M'' is a  [[metric space]] and dissimilarity is expressed as a [[distance metric]], which is symmetric and satisfies the [[triangle inequality]]. Even more common, ''M'' is taken to be the ''d''-dimensional [[vector space]] where dissimilarity is measured using the [[Euclidean distance]], [[Taxicab geometry|Manhattan distance]] or other [[Statistical distance|distance metric]]. However, the dissimilarity function can be arbitrary. One example are asymmetric [[Bregman divergence]]s, for which the triangle inequality does not hold.&lt;ref name=Cayton2008&gt;{{Cite journal

==Methods==

Various solutions to the NNS problem have been proposed.  The quality and usefulness of the algorithms are determined by the time complexity of queries as well as the space complexity of any search data structures that must be maintained. The informal observation usually referred to as the [[curse of dimensionality]] states that there is no general-purpose exact solution for NNS in high-dimensional Euclidean space using polynomial preprocessing and polylogarithmic search time.

=== Exact methods ===

====Linear search====
The simplest solution to the NNS problem is to compute the distance from the query point to every other point in the database, keeping track of the "best so far".  This algorithm, sometimes referred to as the naive approach, has a [[running time]] of ''O''(''dN'') where ''N'' is the [[cardinality]] of ''S'' and ''d'' is the dimensionality of ''M''.  There are no search data structures to maintain, so linear search has no space complexity beyond the storage of the database. Naive search can, on average, outperform space partitioning approaches on higher dimensional spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A quantitative analysis and performance study for similarity search methods in high dimensional spaces|last1=Weber|first1=Roger|last2=Schek|first2=Hans-J.|last3=Blott|first3=Stephen | url=http://www.vldb.org/conf/1998/p194.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Space partitioning====
Since the 1970s, [[branch and bound]] methodology has been applied to the problem. In the case of Euclidean space this approach is known as [[spatial index]] or spatial access methods. Several [[Space partitioning|space-partitioning]] methods have been developed for solving the NNS problem.  Perhaps the simplest is the [[k-d tree]], which iteratively bisects the search space into two regions containing half of the points of the parent region.  Queries are performed via traversal of the tree from the root to a leaf by evaluating the query point at each split. Depending on the distance specified in the query, neighboring branches that might contain hits may also need to be evaluated. For constant dimension query time, average complexity is ''O''(log&amp;nbsp;''N'') &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An introductory tutorial on KD trees|author=Andrew Moore | url=http://www.autonlab.com/autonweb/14665/version/2/part/5/data/moore-tutorial.pdf?branch=main&amp;language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the case of randomly distributed points, worst case complexity is ''O''(''kN''^(1-1/''k''))&lt;ref name=Lee1977&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Alternatively the [[R-tree]] data structure was designed to support nearest neighbor search in dynamic context, as it has efficient algorithms for insertions and deletions such as the [[R* tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | doi = 10.1145/223784.223794| chapter = Nearest neighbor queries| title = Proceedings of the 1995 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data  – SIGMOD '95| pages = 71| year = 1995| last1 = Roussopoulos | first1 = N. | last2 = Kelley | first2 = S. | last3 = Vincent | first3 = F. D. R. | isbn = 0897917316}}&lt;/ref&gt; R-trees can yield nearest neighbors not only for Euclidean distance, but can also be used with other distances.

In case of general metric space branch and bound approach is known under the name of [[metric trees]]. Particular examples include [[vp-tree]] and [[BK-tree]].

Using a set of points taken from a 3-dimensional space and put into a [[Binary space partitioning|BSP tree]], and given a query point taken from the same space, a possible solution to the problem of finding the nearest point-cloud point to the query point is given in the following description of an algorithm.  (Strictly speaking, no such point may exist, because it may not be unique.  But in practice, usually we only care about finding any one of the subset of all point-cloud points that exist at the shortest distance to a given query point.)  The idea is, for each branching of the tree, guess that the closest point in the cloud resides in the half-space containing the query point.  This may not be the case, but it is a good heuristic.  After having recursively gone through all the trouble of solving the problem for the guessed half-space, now compare the distance returned by this result with the shortest distance from the query point to the partitioning plane.  This latter distance is that between the query point and the closest possible point that could exist in the half-space not searched.  If this distance is greater than that returned in the earlier result, then clearly there is no need to search the other half-space.  If there is such a need, then you must go through the trouble of solving the problem for the other half space, and then compare its result to the former result, and then return the proper result.  The performance of this algorithm is nearer to logarithmic time than linear time when the query point is near the cloud, because as the distance between the query point and the closest point-cloud point nears zero, the algorithm needs only perform a look-up using the query point as a key to get the correct result.

=== Approximation methods ===
An approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm is allowed to return points, whose distance from the query is at most &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; times the distance from the query to its nearest points. The appeal of this approach is that, in many cases, an approximate nearest neighbor is almost as good as the exact one. In particular, if the distance measure accurately captures the notion of user quality, then small differences in the distance should not matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Andoni|first=A.|last2=Indyk|first2=P.|date=2006-10-01|title=Near-Optimal Hashing Algorithms for Approximate Nearest Neighbor in High Dimensions|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4031381/|journal=2006 47th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS'06)|pages=459–468|doi=10.1109/FOCS.2006.49|isbn=978-0-7695-2720-8|citeseerx=10.1.1.142.3471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proximity graph methods (such as HNSW&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Malkov|first=Yury|last2=Yashunin|first2=Dmitry|date=2016|title=Efficient and robust approximate nearest neighbor search using Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs|eprint=1603.09320|class=cs.DS}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are considered the current state-of-the-art for the approximate nearest neighbors search.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://erikbern.com/2018/06/17/new-approximate-nearest-neighbor-benchmarks.html|title=New approximate nearest neighbor benchmarks|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.benfrederickson.com/approximate-nearest-neighbours-for-recommender-systems/|title=Approximate Nearest Neighbours for Recommender Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The methods are based on greedy traversing in proximity neighborhood graphs &lt;math&gt;G(V,E)&lt;/math&gt;in which every point &lt;math&gt;x_i \in S &lt;/math&gt; is uniquely associated with vertex &lt;math&gt;v_i \in V &lt;/math&gt;. The search for the nearest neighbors to a query ''q'' in the set ''S'' takes the form of searching for the vertex in the graph &lt;math&gt;G(V,E)&lt;/math&gt;.
The basic algorithm - greedy search, works as follows: search starts from an enter-point vertex &lt;math&gt;v_i \in V &lt;/math&gt; by computing the distances from the query q to each vertex of its the neighborhood &lt;math&gt;\{v_j:(v_i,v_j) \in E\}&lt;/math&gt;, and then finds a vertex with the minimal distance value. If the distance value between the query and the selected vertex is smaller than the one between the query and the current element, then the algorithm moves to the selected vertex, and it becomes new enter-point. The algorithm stops when it reaches a local minimum: a vertex whose neighborhood does not contain a vertex that is closer to the query than the vertex itself.

The idea of proximity neighborhood graphs was exploited in multiple publications, including the seminal paper by Arya and Mount,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arya|first1=Sunil|last2=Mount|first2=David|date=1993|title=Approximate Nearest Neighbor Queries in Fixed Dimensions|journal=Proceedings of the Fourth Annual {ACM/SIGACT-SIAM} Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, 25–27 January 1993, Austin, Texas.|pages=271–280}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the VoroNet system for the plane,&lt;ref name="voroNet"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Olivier|first1=Beaumont|last2=Kermarrec|first2=Anne-Marie|last3=Marchal|first3=Loris|last4=Rivière|first4=Etienne|year=2006|title=VoroNet: A scalable object network based on Voronoi tessellations|journal=INRIA|volume=RR-5833|issue=1|pages=23–29|doi=10.1007/BF00263763|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the RayNet system for the &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}^n&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="rayNet"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Olivier|first1=Beaumont|last2=Kermarrec|first2=Anne-Marie|last3=Rivière|first3=Etienne|year=2007|title=Peer to Peer Multidimensional Overlays: Approximating Complex Structures|journal=Principles of Distributed Systems|volume=4878|issue=|pages=315–328|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-77096-1_23|isbn=978-3-540-77095-4|postscript=.|citeseerx=10.1.1.626.2980}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Metrized Small World&lt;ref name="msw2014"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Malkov|first1=Yury|last2=Ponomarenko|first2=Alexander|last3=Krylov|first3=Vladimir|last4=Logvinov|first4=Andrey|year=2014|title=Approximate nearest neighbor algorithm based on navigable small world graphs|journal=Information Systems|volume=45|pages=61–68|doi=10.1016/j.is.2013.10.006|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and HNSW&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; algorithms for the general case of spaces with a distance function. These works were preceded by a pioneering paper by Toussaint, where he introduced a concept of a ''relative neighborhood'' graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Toussaint|first1=Godfried|date=1980|title=The relative neighbourhood graph of a finite planar set|journal=Pattern Recognition|volume=12|issue=4|pages=261–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Locality sensitive hashing====

[[Locality sensitive hashing]] (LSH) is a technique for grouping points in space into 'buckets' based on some distance metric operating on the points. Points that are close to each other under the chosen metric are mapped to the same bucket with high probability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=A. Rajaraman  |author2=J. Ullman |lastauthoramp=yes | url=http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds.html |title=Mining of Massive Datasets, Ch. 3 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nearest neighbor search in spaces with small intrinsic dimension====

The [[cover tree]] has a theoretical bound that is based on the dataset's [[doubling constant]]. The bound on search time is ''O''(''c''&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') where ''c''  is the [[Expansivity constant|expansion constant]] of the dataset.

====Projected radial search====

In the special case where the data is a dense 3D map of geometric points, the projection geometry of the sensing technique can be used to dramatically simplify the search problem.
This approach requires that the 3D data is organized by a projection to a two dimensional grid and assumes that the data is spatially smooth across neighboring grid cells with the exception of object boundaries.
These assumptions are valid when dealing with 3D sensor data in applications such as surveying, robotics and stereo vision but may not hold for unorganized data in general.
In practice this technique has an average search time of ''O''(''1'')  or ''O''(''K'')  for the ''k''-nearest neighbor problem when applied to real world stereo vision data.
&lt;ref name=panSearch/&gt;

====Vector approximation files====

In high dimensional spaces, tree indexing structures become useless because an increasing percentage of the nodes need to be examined anyway. To speed up linear search, a compressed version of the feature vectors stored in RAM is used to prefilter the datasets in a first run. The final candidates are determined in a second stage using the uncompressed data from the disk for distance calculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Approximation-Based Data Structure for Similarity Search|last1=Weber|first1=Roger|last2=Blott|first2=Stephen|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/83e4/e3281411ffef40654a4b5d29dae48130aefb.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Compression/clustering based search====
The VA-file approach is a special case of a compression based search, where each feature component is compressed uniformly and independently. The optimal compression technique in multidimensional spaces is [[Vector Quantization]] (VQ), implemented through clustering. The database is clustered and the most "promising" clusters are retrieved. Huge gains over VA-File, tree-based indexes and sequential scan have been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Adaptive cluster-distance bounding for similarity search in image databases|last1=Ramaswamy|first1=Sharadh|last2=Rose|first2=Kenneth|journal=ICIP|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Adaptive cluster-distance bounding for high-dimensional indexing|last1=Ramaswamy|first1=Sharadh|last2=Rose|first2=Kenneth|journal=TKDE|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also note the parallels between clustering and LSH.

==Variants==

There are numerous variants of the NNS problem and the two most well-known are the [[K-nearest neighbor algorithm|''k''-nearest neighbor search]] and the [[ε-approximate nearest neighbor search]].

===&lt;span id="K-nearest neighbor"&gt; ''k''-nearest neighbors &lt;/span&gt;===

[[K-nearest neighbor algorithm|''k''-nearest neighbor search]] identifies the top ''k'' nearest neighbors to the query.  This technique is commonly used in predictive analytics to estimate or classify a point based on the consensus of its neighbors. ''k''-nearest neighbor graphs are graphs in which every point is connected to its ''k'' nearest neighbors.

===Approximate nearest neighbor===
In some applications it may be acceptable to retrieve a "good guess" of the nearest neighbor. In those cases, we can use an algorithm which doesn't guarantee to return the actual nearest neighbor in every case, in return for improved speed or memory savings. Often such an algorithm will find the nearest neighbor in a majority of cases, but this depends strongly on the dataset being queried.

Algorithms that support the approximate nearest neighbor search include [[Locality-sensitive hashing#LSH algorithm for nearest neighbor search|locality-sensitive hashing]], [[best bin first]] and [[balanced box-decomposition tree]] based search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=S.|last1=Arya|author2-link=David Mount|first2=D. M.|last2=Mount|author3-link=Nathan Netanyahu|first3=N. S.|last3=Netanyahu|first4=R.|last4=Silverman|first5=A.|last5=Wu|title=An optimal algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor searching|journal= Journal of the ACM|volume=45|number=6|pages=891–923|date=1998|url=http://www.cse.ust.hk/faculty/arya/pub/JACM.pdf|doi=10.1145/293347.293348|citeseerx=10.1.1.15.3125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nearest neighbor distance ratio===

[[Nearest neighbor distance ratio]] do not apply the threshold on the direct distance from the original point to the challenger neighbor but on a ratio of it depending on the distance to the previous neighbor. It is used in [[Content-based image retrieval|CBIR]] to retrieve pictures through a "query by example" using the similarity between local features. More generally it is involved in several [[Pattern matching|matching]] problems.

===Fixed-radius near neighbors===

[[Fixed-radius near neighbors]] is the problem where one wants to efficiently find all points given in [[Euclidean space]] within a given fixed distance from a specified point. The data structure should work on a distance which is fixed however the query point is arbitrary.

===All nearest neighbors===

For some applications (e.g. [[entropy estimation]]), we may have ''N'' data-points and wish to know which is the nearest neighbor ''for every one of those N points''. This could of course be achieved by running a nearest-neighbor search once for every point, but an improved strategy would be an algorithm that exploits the information redundancy between these ''N'' queries to produce a more efficient search. As a simple example: when we find the distance from point ''X'' to point ''Y'', that also tells us the distance from point ''Y'' to point ''X'', so the same calculation can be reused in two different queries.

Given a fixed dimension, a semi-definite positive norm (thereby including every  [[lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; norm]]), and ''n'' points in this space, the nearest neighbour of every point can be found in ''O''(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') time and the ''m'' nearest neighbours of every point can be found in ''O''(''mn''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The '''orienting response''' ('''OR'''), also called ''orienting reflex'', is an organism's immediate response to a change in its environment, when that change is not sudden enough to elicit the [[startle response |startle reflex]]. The phenomenon was first described by Russian physiologist [[Ivan Sechenov]] in his 1863 book ''Reflexes of the Brain'', and the term ('ориентировочный рефлекс' in Russian) was coined by [[Ivan Pavlov]], who also referred to it as the ''Shto takoye?'' (Что такое? or ''What is it?'') reflex. The orienting response is a reaction to novel or significant stimuli. In the 1950s the orienting response was studied systematically by the Russian scientist [[Eugene N. Sokolov|Evgeny Sokolov]], who documented the phenomenon called "[[habituation]]", referring to a gradual "familiarity effect" and reduction of the orienting response with repeated stimulus presentations.&lt;ref name="Sokolov, E.N 1960, pp. 187"&gt;Sokolov, E.N, Neuronal models and the orienting reflex, in ''The Central Nervous System and Behavior'', Mary A.B. Brazier, ed. NY: JosiahMacy, Jr. Foundation, 1960, pp. 187–276&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have found a number of [[physiological]] mechanisms associated with OR, including changes in phasic and tonic [[skin conductance response]] (SCR), [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG), and heart rate following a novel or significant stimulus.  These observations all occur within seconds of stimulus introduction.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8986.2008.00702.x | last1 = Bradley | first1 = M.M. | year = 2008 | title = Natural selective attention: Orienting and emotion | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 1–11 | pmid = 18778317 | pmc = 3645482 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, EEG studies of OR have corresponded particularly with the [[P300 (neuroscience)|P300]] wave and [[P3a]] component of the OR-related [[event-related potential]] (ERP).&lt;ref name="fMRI"&gt;Polich, J. (2003). Overview of P3a and P3b. In J. Polich (Ed.), Detection of Change:Event-Related Potential and fMRI Findings (pp. 83-98). Kluwer Academic Press: Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neural correlates==

Current understanding of the localization of OR in the brain is still unclear.  In one study using [[fMRI]] and SCR, researchers found novel visual stimuli associated with SCR responses typical of an OR also corresponded to activation in the [[hippocampus]], [[anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate gyrus]], and [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]].  These regions are also believed to be largely responsible for emotion, decision making, and memory.  Increases in cerebellar and extrastriate cortex were also recorded, which are significantly implicated in visual perception and processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00001756-200009110-00037| last1 = Williams | first1 = L | last2 = Brammer | first2 = M | last3 = Skerrett | first3 = D | last4 = Lagapolous | first4 = J | last5 = Rennie | first5 = C | last6 = Kozek | first6 = K | last7 = Oliveri | first7 = G | last8 = Peduto | first8 = T | last9 = Gordon | first9 = E | year = 2000 | title = The neural correlates of orienting: An integration of fMRI and skin conductance orienting | url = http://tamu.edu/faculty/bortfeld/689/689_Spring'07/readings/Williams_etal_NR2000.pdf| journal = Brain Imaging | volume = 11 | issue = 13| pages = 3011–3015 | pmid =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
When an individual encounters a novel environmental stimulus, such as a bright flash of light or a sudden loud noise, he or she will pay attention to it even before identifying it. This orienting reflex seems to be present early in development, as babies will turn their head toward an environmental change{Cowan, 1995}.  From an evolutionary perspective, this mechanism is useful in reacting quickly to events that call for immediate action.

===Habituation===
Sokolov's investigation of OR was primarily motivated in understanding habituation.  Provided the first introduction of a novel stimulus, defined in Sokolovian terms as any change from the "currently active neuronal model" (what the individual is currently focused on), results in OR.  However, with repeated introduction of the same stimulus, the orienting response will decrease in intensity and eventually cease.&lt;ref name="Sokolov, E.N 1960, pp. 187"/&gt;  When novel stimuli have an associated contextual significance, repeated stimulus will still result in a sequentially decreasing OR, though at a modified rate of decay.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Orienting in decision-making===
The orienting response is believed to play an integral role in preference formation.   When faced with deciding between two options, subjects in studies by Simion &amp; Shimojo were shown to choose the items they preferentially orient their gaze toward.  This gaze can occur while the stimulus is present or after it has been removed, the latter causing gaze to be fixated at the point in which the stimulus had been present.  Gaze bias ceases following a decision, suggesting that gaze bias is the cause of preference and not its effect. Noting this postulated causal link with the irrelevance of a stimulus presence, it is argued that gaze orientation supports decision-making mechanisms in inducing a preferential bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3758/bf03193916| last1 = Simion | first1 = C | last2 = Shimojo | first2 = S | year = 2007 | title = Interrupting the cascade: Orienting contributes to decision making even in the absence of visual stimulation | url = | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 69 | issue = 4| pages = 591–595 | pmid = 17727112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role between emotion and attention===
Both novelty and significance of a stimulation are implicated in the generation of an orienting response.  Specifically, the emotional significance of a stimulus, defined by its level of pleasantness, can affect the intensity of the orienting response toward focusing attention on a subject.  Studies showed that during exposure to neutral and emotionally significant novel images, both pleasant and unpleasant images produced higher skin conductance readings than neutral images.   With repeated stimulation, all skin conductance readings diminished relative to novel introduction, though with emotionally significant content diminishing more slowly.  Conversely, studies observing cardiac deceleration during novel stimuli introduction showed significantly more deceleration for unpleasant stimuli compared to pleasant and neutral stimuli.  These findings suggest that OR represents a combination of responses that act in tandem to a common stimulus.  More importantly, the differences between emotionally charged and neutral stimuli demonstrates the influence of emotion in orienting attention, despite novelty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
In his 2007 book ''[[The Assault on Reason]]'', [[Al Gore]] posited that watching television affects the orienting response, an effect similar to [[vicarious traumatization]].

'''Phonetically Intuitive English''' ('''PIE''') is a scheme&lt;ref name=pie_scheme&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/phoneticallyintuitiveenglish/using-pie/schemes The PIE scheme]&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Google Chrome|Chrome]] [[browser extension]]&lt;ref name=pie_chrome&gt;[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jafbohhbdpejlcfpkbbpkegglokegjid PIE at Chrome Web Store]&lt;/ref&gt; that automatically adds [[diacritics]] to [[English language|English]] words on Web pages to show [[pronunciation]], intended for English-as-a-second-language ([[ESL]]) learners to learn correct pronunciations as they browse the Web, and for children in English-speaking countries to [[Reading education in the United States|learn to read]]. The free project has been reported&lt;ref name=pcworld_english&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/256680/pie_a_chrome_extension_that_can_help_with_reading_and_pronunciation.html PCWorld (English) story on PIE]&lt;/ref&gt; by ''[[PCWorld (magazine)|PCWorld]]'' and other media outlets and invited to National Education Association Exposition 2013, receiving very positive feedback from educators nationwide.

== Features ==
The [[free and open source]] browser extension&lt;ref name=pie_chrome /&gt; uses [[American English]] pronunciation data from the [[CMU Pronouncing Dictionary]] and a one-page scheme also called "Phonetically Intuitive English" (PIE)&lt;ref name=pie_scheme /&gt; to mark up English words with diacritics. The project claims that the scheme is designed to be very easy to learn.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/phoneticallyintuitiveenglish/ PIE's official project website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the English level of the user, PIE offers three modes, Full, Lite and Extra Lite, to show diacritics to different extents. The Full mode shows pronunciations to a great detail (e.g. even the silent g and h as in "light" are marked with a "silence mark"). More advanced learners may prefer the Lite mode (e.g. the silence marks on w, h, y and e will be omitted, as in "low", "she", "bay" and "take"). Very advanced learners can use the Extra Lite mode, which will further omit all schwa marks (e.g. the second and third a in "Canada" will have no marks).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10265">A '''piping and instrumentation diagram''' ('''P&amp;ID''') is a detailed diagram in the [[process industry]] which shows the [[piping]] and [[pressure vessel|vessel]]s in the process flow, together with the [[instrumentation]] and control devices.

Superordinate to the ''piping and instrumentation flowsheet'' is the ''[[process flow diagram]] (PFD)'' which indicates the more general flow of plant processes and equipment and relationship between major equipment of a plant facility.

==Contents and function==
[[File:Industrial control loop.jpg|thumb|Example of a single industrial control loop; showing continuously modulated control of process flow.]]
[[Image:Pump with tank pid en.svg|thumb|Piping and instrumentation diagram of pump with storage tank. Symbols according to EN ISO 10628 and EN 62424.]]
[[Image:P&amp;ID.JPG|thumb|300px|A more complex example of a '''P&amp;ID'''.]]
A piping and instrumentation diagram (P&amp;ID) is defined by the Institute of Instrumentation and Control as follows:
# A diagram which shows the interconnection of process equipment and the instrumentation used to control the process. In the process industry, a standard set of symbols is used to prepare drawings of processes. The instrument symbols used in these drawings are generally based on [[International Society of Automation]] (ISA) Standard S5.1
# The primary schematic drawing used for laying out a [[process control]] installation.

They usually contain the following information:
*Process piping, sizes and identification, including:
**Pipe classes or piping line numbers
**Flow directions
**Interconnections references 
**Permanent start-up, flush and bypass lines
*Mechanical equipment and process control instrumentation and designation (names, numbers, unique tag identifiers), including:
**Valves and their identifications (e.g. isolation, shutoff, relief and [[safety valve]]s)
**Control inputs and outputs ([[sensor]]s and final elements, interlocks) 
**Miscellaneous - vents, drains, [[flange]]s, special fittings, sampling lines, reducers and increasers &lt;!-- and swagers  &lt;&lt; I could not find any references to "swager" in this context. What is a "swager"?--&gt;
*Interfaces for class changes 
*Computer control system 
*Identification of components and subsystems delivered by others

P&amp;IDs are originally drawn up at the design stage from a combination of process flow sheet data, the mechanical process equipment design, and the instrumentation engineering design.  During the design stage, the diagram also provides the basis for the development of system control schemes, allowing for further safety and operational investigations, such as a [[Hazard and operability study]] (HAZOP). To do this, it is critical to demonstrate the physical sequence of equipment and systems, as well as how these systems connect.

P&amp;IDs also play a significant role in the maintenance and modification of the process after initial build. Modifications are red-penned onto the diagrams and are vital records of the current plant design.

They are also vital in enabling development of;
*Control and shutdown schemes
*Safety and regulatory requirements
*Start-up sequences
*Operational understanding.

P&amp;IDs form the basis for the live mimic diagrams displayed on [[graphical user interface]]s of large [[industrial control system]]s such as [[SCADA]] and [[distributed control system]]s.

==Identification and reference designation==
Based on STANDARD [[ANSI]]/[[Instrument Society of America|ISA]] S5.1 and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 14617-6, the P&amp;ID is used for the identification of measurements within the process. The identifications consist of up to 5 letters. The first identification letter is for the measured value, the second is a modifier, 3rd indicates passive/readout function, 4th - active/output function, and the 5th is the function modifier. This is followed by loop number, which is unique to that loop. For instance FIC045 means it is the Flow Indicating Controller in control loop 045. This is also known as the "tag" identifier of the field device, which is normally given to the location and function of the instrument. The same loop may have FT045 - which is the flow transmitter in the same loop.

For reference designation of any equipment in industrial systems the standard [[IEC 61346]] (''Industrial systems, installations and equipment and industrial products — Structuring principles and reference designations'') can be applied. For the function  ''Measurement'' the reference designator '''B''' is used, followed by the above listed letter for the measured variable.

For reference designation of any equipment in a power station the [[KKS Power Plant Classification System]] can be applied.

&lt;/score&gt;|width=210|caption=Repeat signs around the second note}}In [[music]], a '''repeat sign''' is a [[Musical notation|sign]] that indicates a section should be [[repetition (music)|repeated]]. If the piece has one repeat sign alone, then that means to repeat from the beginning, and then continue on (or stop, if the sign appears at the end of the piece). A corresponding sign facing the other way indicates where the repeat is to begin. These are similar to the instructions [[da capo]] and [[dal segno]].

{{Quote|Repeat. ''Wiederholungszeichen'' (''Ger.'') A sign that a movement or part of a movement is to be twice performed. That which is to be repeated is generally included within the sign of two or four dots in the spaces...When the performer does not, on repeating, go so far as the last dot-sign, but finishes at a previous cadence, it is usual to write over the repeat, Da Capo, placing a pause and ''fine'' over the chord at which the performer is to stop. If the signs of the repeat do not coincide with a well-defined portion of a movement the sign &amp;#x1D10B; is sometimes added.&lt;ref&gt;Stainer, John and Barrett, William Alexander (1898).

These are called "first-time bars" and "second-time bars", or "first and second endings". They are also known as "[[wikt:volta#Italian|volta]] brackets" and have no limit to how many there can be.

==In Unicode==
In [[Unicode]], repeat signs are part of the [[Musical Symbols (Unicode block)|Musical Symbols]] and are coded as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D100.pdf PDF of Musical Symbols block from the unicode consortium]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other notation==
When only standard  keyboard characters are available, the [[punctuation]] marks [[vertical bar]] and [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] are used to represent repeat signs: &lt;code&gt;|: ... :|&lt;/code&gt;

In [[Gregorian chant]], a repeat is indicated by a [[Roman numeral]] following a section. This is common particularly in a [[Kyrie]], where the lines followed by "iii" or "iij" are to be sung three times (corresponding to the correct liturgical form).

In [[shape-note]] singing, repeat signs usually have four dots, between each line of the staff. The corresponding sign to show where the repeat is from is either the same sign reversed (if it is at the beginning of a bar), or the dots themselves (if it is in the middle of a bar). First and second endings are given with just the numbers above the corresponding bars. Repeats notated at the beginning of a verse, or given with multiple lines of text per verse, are generally required; the repeats given for most songs of the final few lines are optional, and almost always used only for the final verse sung.

'''Solar physics''' is the branch of astrophysics that specializes in the study of the [[Sun]]. It deals with detailed measurements that are possible only for our closest star.  It intersects with many disciplines of pure [[physics]], [[astrophysics]], and [[computer science]], including [[fluid dynamics]], [[plasma physics]] including [[magnetohydrodynamics]], [[seismology]], [[particle physics]], [[atomic physics]], [[nuclear physics]], [[stellar evolution]], [[space physics]], [[spectroscopy]], [[radiative transfer]], [[optics|applied optics]], [[signal processing]], [[computer vision]], [[computational physics]], [[stellar physics]] and [[solar astronomy]].

Because the Sun is uniquely situated for close-range observing (other stars cannot be resolved with anything like the spatial or temporal resolution that the Sun can), there is a split between the related discipline of observational astrophysics (of distant stars) and observational solar physics.

The study of solar physics is also important as it is believed that changes in the solar atmosphere and solar activity can have a major impact on Earth's climate. The Sun also provides a "physical laboratory" for the study of plasma physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Solar Physics|first=Marshall Space Flight Center|title=Why we study the Sun|url=http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/whysolar.shtml|work=NASA|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient times===
Babylonians were keeping a record of solar eclipses, with the oldest record originating from the ancient city of Ugarit, in modern-day Syria. This record dates to about 1300 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Littman|first=M.|title=Totality: Eclipses of the Sun|date=2000|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|edition=2nd|author2=Willcox, F |author3=Espenak, F. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Chinese astronomers were also observing solar phenomena (such as solar eclipses and visible sunspots) with the purpose of keeping track of calendars, which were based on lunar and solar cycles. Unfortunately, records kept before 720 BC are very vague and offer no useful information. However, after 720 BC, 37 solar eclipses were noted over the course of 240 years.&lt;ref name="ancient china"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sten|first=Odenwald|title=Ancient eclipses in China|url=http://sunearthday.nasa.gov/2009eclipse/ancienteclipses.php|work=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval times===
Astronomical knowledge flourished in the Islamic world during medieval times. Many observatories were built in cities from Damascus to Baghdad, where detailed astronomical observations were taken. Particularly, a few solar parameters were measured and detailed observations of the Sun were taken. Solar observations were taken with the purpose of navigation, but mostly for timekeeping. Islam requires its followers to pray five times a day, at specific position of the Sun in the sky. As such, accurate observations of the Sun and its trajectory on the sky were needed. In the late 10th century, Iranian astronomer [[al-Khujandi|Abu-Mahmud Khojandi]] built a massive observatory near Tehran. There, he took accurate measurements of a series of meridian transits of the Sun, which he later used to calculate the obliquity of the ecliptic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arab and Islamic astronomy|url=http://www.starteachastronomy.com/arab.html|work=StarTeach Astronomy Education|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Western Europe was cut from all sources of ancient scientific knowledge, especially those written in Greek. This, plus de-urbanisation and diseases such as the Black Death led to a decline in scientific knowledge in Medieval Europe, especially in the early Middle Ages. During this period, observations of the Sun were taken either in relation to the zodiac, or to assist in building places of worship such as churches and cathedrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Portal to the heritage of astronomy|title=Theme: medieval astronomy in Europe|url=http://www2.astronomicalheritage.net/index.php/show-theme?idtheme=16|work=UNESCO|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance period===
In astronomy, the renaissance period started with the work of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]. He proposed that planets revolve around the Sun and not around the Earth, as it was believed at the time. This model is known as the heliocentric model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor Redd|first=Nola|title=Nicolaus Copernicus biography: facts &amp; discoveries|url=http://www.space.com/15684-nicolaus-copernicus.html|work=Space.com|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work was later expanded by [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo Galilei]]. Particularly, Galilei used his new telescope to look at the Sun. In 1610, he discovered sunspots on its surface. In the autumn of 1611, [[Johannes Fabricius]] wrote the first book on sunspots, "De Maculis in Sole Observatis" (On the spots observed in the Sun).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunspots|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/observations/sunspots.html|work=The Galileo Project|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern times===
Modern day solar physics is focused towards understanding the many phenomena observed with the help of modern telescopes and satellites. Of particular interest are the structure of the solar photosphere, the coronal heat problem and sunspots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wang|first=Pinghzi|title=Solar physics research trends|date=2008|publisher=[[Nova Science Publishers]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=royEo2yT9XMC&amp;pg=PA358 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

The [[Solar Physics Division]] of the [[American Astronomical Society]] boasts 555 members (as of May 2007), compared to several thousand in the parent organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Solar Physics Division|title=Membership|url=http://spd.aas.org/navbar_members.html|work=American Astronomical Society|accessdate=28 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322013145/http://spd.aas.org/navbar_members.html|archivedate=22 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major thrust of current (2009) effort in the field of solar physics is integrated understanding of the entire [[solar system]] including the Sun and its effects throughout interplanetary space within the [[heliosphere]] and on [[planet]]s and planetary [[atmosphere]]s. Studies of phenomena that affect multiple systems in the heliosphere, or that are considered to fit within a heliospheric context, are called [[heliophysics]], a new coinage that entered  usage in the early years of the current millennium.

'''Sophus Thalbitzer''' (1871–1941) was a Danish psychiatrist and medical doctor specializing in [[manic depressive psychosis|manic depressive psychoses]]. He successfully influenced [[LGBT history in Denmark|Danish legislation on homosexuality]] towards decriminalization in 1933.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-25927595 |title=Where is it illegal to be gay? |accessdate=23 February 2014 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Thalbitzer never married in his life, there are no sources to support the hypotheses that he was [[homosexuality|homosexual]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]].

==Life==
In 1912 Thalbitzer became consultant at the [[St Hans Women's Hospital]] near [[Copenhagen]].
In 1923 Thalbitzer became a member of the Advisory Board of Directors of the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]]. In 1924 and 1925 he published two articles on [[homosexuality]], successfully influencing Danish criminal legislation with his 'scientific' defence of the lowering of homosexual age of consent from 21 to 18.&lt;ref name="AldrichWotherspoon2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilhelm von Rosen|editor=Robert Aldrich; Garry Wotherspoon|title=Who's who in Gay and Lesbian History: From Antiquity to World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zLWTqBmifh0C&amp;pg=PA518|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-15983-8|pages=518–9|chapter=Thalbitzer, Sophus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], '''statistical semantics''' applies the methods of [[statistics]] to the problem of determining the meaning of words or phrases, ideally through [[unsupervised learning]], to a degree of precision at least sufficient for the purpose of [[information retrieval]]. 

==History==

The term ''statistical semantics'' was first used by [[Warren Weaver]] in his well-known paper on [[machine translation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weaver|1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that [[word sense disambiguation]] for machine translation should be based on the [[co-occurrence]] frequency of the context words near a given target word. The underlying assumption that "a word is characterized by the company it keeps" was advocated by [[J. R. Firth|J.R. Firth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assumption is known in [[linguistics]] as the [[distributional hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sahlgren|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emile Delavenay defined ''statistical semantics'' as the "statistical study of meanings of words and their frequency and order of recurrence".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Delavenay|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[George Furnas|Furnas]] et al. 1983" is frequently cited as a foundational contribution to statistical semantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Furnas|Landauer|Gomez|Dumais|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An early success in the field was [[latent semantic analysis]].

==Applications==

Research in statistical semantics has resulted in a wide variety of algorithms that use the distributional hypothesis to discover many aspects of [[semantics]], by applying statistical techniques to [[Text corpus|large corpora]]:
* Measuring the [[Semantic similarity|similarity in word meanings]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lund|Burgess|Atchley|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landauer|Dumais|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonald|Ramscar|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Terra|Clarke|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Measuring the similarity in word relations &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turney|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Modeling [[similarity-based generalization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yarlett|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Discovering words with a given relation&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hearst|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Classifying relations between words&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turney|Littman|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Extracting keywords from documents&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|Paynter|Witten|Gutwin|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turney|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Measuring the cohesiveness of text&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turney|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Discovering the different senses of words&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pantel|Lin|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Distinguishing the different senses of words&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turney|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subcognitive aspects of words&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turney|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Distinguishing praise from criticism&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turney|Littman|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related fields==

Statistical semantics focuses on the meanings of common words and the relations between common words, unlike [[text mining]], which tends to focus on whole documents, document collections, or named entities (names of people, places, and organizations). Statistical semantics is a subfield of [[computational semantics]], which is in turn a subfield of [[computational linguistics]] and [[natural language processing]].

Many of the applications of statistical semantics (listed above) can also be addressed by [[lexicon]]-based algorithms, instead of the [[text corpus|corpus]]-based algorithms of statistical semantics. One advantage of corpus-based algorithms is that they are typically not as labour-intensive as lexicon-based algorithms. Another advantage is that they are usually easier to adapt to new languages than lexicon-based algorithms. However, the best performance on an application is often achieved by combining the two approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turney|Littman|Bigham|Shnayder|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Systems Chemistry''' is the science of studying networks of interacting molecules, to create new functions from an ensemble of molecular components at different hierarchical levels with emergent properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Sadownik |last2=Otto |year= 2015| title = Systems Chemistry | journal = Encyclopedia of Astrobiology | pages = 1–3 | url = https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-642-27833-4_1095-2| }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rug.nl/research/centre-systems-chemistry/|title=Centre for Systems Chemistry|website=University of Groningen|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/What-is-systems-chemistry-and-how-does-it-differ-from-systems-biology|title=What is systems chemistry and how does it differ from systems biology?|first=Kristina|last=Kučanda|year=2014|website=Quora|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems chemistry also related to the origin of life ([[abiogenesis]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Kiedrowski |last2=Herdewijn |year= 2010| title = Welcome Home, Systems Chemists! | journal = Journal of Systems Chemistry |volume = 1| pages = 1 | url = https://jsystchem.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1759-2208-1-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations to Systems Biology==
Systems chemistry is a relatively young sub-discipline of [[chemistry]], where the focus does not lie on the individual chemical components but rather on the overall network of interacting molecules and on their emergent properties. Hence, it combines the classical knowledge of chemistry (structure, reactions and interactions of molecules) together with a systems approach inspired by [[systems biology]] and [[systems science]].

==History==
While multicomponent reactions have been studied for centuries, the idea of deliberately analyzing mixtures and reaction networks is more recent. The first mentions of systems chemistry as a field date from 2005 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Stankiewicz | last2=Eckardt |year= 2006| title = Chembiogenesis 2005 and Systems Chemistry Workshop | journal = Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. |volume = 45| pages = 324–344 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.200504139/full }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Kindermann | last2=Kiedrowski |year= 2005| title = Systems Chemistry: Kinetic and Computational Analysis of a Nearly Exponential Organic Replicator | journal = Angew. Chem. |volume = 117| pages = 6908–6913 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ange.200501527/abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Early adopters focused on prebiotic chemistry combined with [[supramolecular chemistry]], before it was generalized to the study of emergent properties and functions of any complex molecular systems. A 2017 review in the field of systems chemistry &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Ashkenasy |last2=Taylor |year= 2017| title = Systems Chemistry | journal = Chem. Soc. Rev. |volume = 46| pages = 2543–2554 | url = https://jsystchem.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1759-2208-1-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; described the state of the art as out-of-equilibrium self-assembly, fuelled molecular motion, chemical networks in compartments and oscillating reactions.

==Examples==
[[Dynamic combinatorial chemistry]] has been used as a method to develop ligands for biomolecules and receptors for small molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li |last2=Otto |year= 2013| title = Dynamic Combinatorial Libraries: From Exploring Molecular Recognition to Systems Chemistry | journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc. |volume = 135 | pages = 9222–9239 | url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja402586c }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ligands that can recognize biomolecules are being identified by preparing libraries of potential ligands in the presence of a target biomacromolecule. This approach sets the stage for their application as diagnostic biosensors for fast monitoring of imbalances and illnesses and therapeutic agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Verma |last2=Rotello | year= 2005 | title = Surface recognition of biomacromolecules using nanoparticle receptors | journal = Chem. Comm. |volume = 3| pages = 303–312 | url = http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2005/CC/b410889b#!divAbstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual components of certain chemical system will self-assemble to form receptors which are
complementary to target molecule. In principle, the preferred library members will select and
amplify based on the strongest interactions between the template and products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Kiedrowski |last2=Herdewijn |year= 2008| title = Systems chemistry | journal =  Chem. Soc. Rev. |volume = 37| pages = 101–108 | url = http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2008/cs/b611921m }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecular networks &amp; equilibrium==
A fundamental difference exists between chemistry as it is performed in most laboratories and chemistry as it occurs in life. Laboratory processes are mostly designed such that the (closed) system goes thermodynamically downhill; i.e. the product state is of lower [[Gibbs free energy]], yielding stable molecules that can be isolated and stored. Yet the chemistry of life operates in a very different way: Most molecules from which living systems are constituted are turned over continuously and are not necessarily thermodynamically stable. Nevertheless, living systems can be stable, but in a [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] sense. Such homeostatic (open) systems are far-from-equilibrium and are dissipative: they need energy to maintain themselves. In dissipative controlled systems the continuous supply of energy allows a continuous transition between different supramolecular states, where systems with unexpected properties may be discovered. One of the grand challenges of Systems Chemistry is to unveil [[complex network|complex reactions networks]], where molecules continuously consume energy to perform specific functions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2430">In [[computer science]] and [[computer engineering|engineering]], a '''test vector''' is a set of inputs provided to a system in order to test that system.  In [[software development]], test vectors are a methodology of [[software testing]] and [[software verification and validation]]. 

==Rationale==

In computer science and engineering, a system acts as a [[computable function]].  An example of a specific function could be &lt;math&gt;y = f(x)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the output of the system and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the input; however, most systems' inputs are not one-dimensional. When the inputs are multi-dimensional, we could say that the system takes the form &lt;math&gt;y = f(x_1, x_2, ...)&lt;/math&gt; ; however, we can generalize this equation to a general form &lt;math&gt;Y = C(X)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is the result of the system's execution, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the set of [[computable function]]s, and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an input vector.  While testing the system, various test vectors must be used to examine the system's behavior with differing inputs.

==Example==
For example, consider a login page with two input fields: a [[username]] field and a [[password]] field. In that case, the login system can be described as:
 
&lt;math&gt;
y = L(u,p)
&lt;/math&gt; 

with &lt;math&gt;y \in \{ true , false \}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u,p \in \{ String \}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;true&lt;/math&gt; designating login successful, and &lt;math&gt;false&lt;/math&gt; designating login failure, respectively.

Making things more generic, we can suggest that the function &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; takes input as a 2-dimensional [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] and outputs a one-dimensional vector ([[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]).
This can be written in the following way:-

&lt;math&gt;
Y = L(X)
&lt;/math&gt;

with 
&lt;math&gt;
X = [ x_1, x_2 ]=[u,p] \; ; \; Y = [ y_1 ] 
&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is called the input vector, and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is called the output vector.

In order to test the login page, it is necessary to pass some sample input vectors &lt;math&gt;\{X_1, X_2, X_3, ...\}&lt;/math&gt;.  In this context &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; is called a test vector.

'''''The Concord Review: A Quarterly Review of Essays by Students of History''''' is an [[academic journal]] dedicated to publishing the research papers of [[high school]] students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Your Name in Print: A Teen's Guide to Publishing for Fun, Profit and Academic Success |last=Harper |first=Elizabeth |authorlink= |author2=Timothy Harper |year=2005 |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |location= |isbn=978-0-312-33759-9 |page=166 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1987 by [[William H. Fitzhugh (teacher)|William H. Fitzhugh]], a [[Massachusetts]] educator dismayed with the "[[dumbing down]]" of writing standards in American secondary schools, publication in the ''Review'' is considered among the most prestigious awards for high school students.&lt;ref name=Dillon&gt;{{cite news |title=Journal Showcases Dying Art of the Research Paper |author=Sam Dillon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/08/education/08research.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=7 January 2011 |accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issued quarterly, the journal publishes research monographs on history topics from high school students from any country, as long as they are in English. Submissions are typically 4000 to 5500 words long, and must be accompanied by a subscription fee (ranging from $70-$150) to the journal in order to be considered.

In addition to publishing the journal, The Concord Review, Inc. engages in a number of other projects. Five outstanding essays per year are awarded the [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] Prize of about $3000.&lt;ref name = Rosemary&gt;{{cite book |title=Teaching the gifted in an inclusion classroom: Activities that work |last=Callard-Szulgit |first=Rosemary S. |authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education |location= |isbn=978-1-57886-185-9 |page=142 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fitzhugh also founded the National History Club, with chapters in hundreds of American high schools. Also, The Concord Review, Inc. operates a service called the National Writing Board, which for a fee of $100 will evaluate student writing and forward the results to college admissions committees.&lt;ref name = Proctor/&gt;

== Reception and support ==
Among others, the ''Review'' has been supported by Boston-based multimillionaire [[John Abele]].&lt;ref name="Dillon" /&gt;

Timelines of [[invention]]s display the development and progression of art, design, architecture, music and literature

==Invention in art, design and architecture==

''dates may be approximations''

* 350,000 BCE – [[Paint]] was invented by early man.  Pigment and paint grinding equipment was found in a cave at Twin Rivers near Lusaka, Zambia.
* 31,000 BCE – Representational painting was invented.  Murals of stampeding bulls, cantering horses, red bears and woolly rhinoceros are found in the [[Chauvet Cave]]s in France.
* 22,000 BCE – [[Sculpture]] was invented by [[Paleolithic]] tribes who created the female statuette called the [[Venus of Willendorf]], found in near Willendorf, Austria.
* 4000 BCE – [[Papyrus]], the precursor to [[paper]], was invented by the Egyptians by pounding flat woven mats of reeds.
* 2500 BCE – Egyptian blue pigment was invented by Egyptian chemists using a mixture of limestone (calcium oxide), malachite (copper oxide) and quartz (silica) fired to about 800–900 degrees Celsius.
* 500 BCE – [[Encaustic painting|Encaustic]] paints are invented by Greek artists by mixing colored pigments and wax.
* 450 BCE – Depicting the illusion of three-dimensional form on a two-dimensional surface was invented with the [[chiaroscuro]] painting technique that employs highlights and shadows.
* 250 BCE – [[Glassblowing]] was invented by Syrian craftsmen in Babylonia.
* 105 – [[Paper]] was invented by Ts’ai Lun, a Chinese court official.
* 650 – [[Porcelain]] was invented by Chinese artists in the Tang Dynasty as a fired mixture of kaolin (a clay) and petuntse (a feldspar).
* 1306 – A more naturalistic means of representational painting was invented by [[Giotto di Bondone]] using depth, perspective and temporal realism to present a single moment in time.
* 15th century – A [[cupola]] or dome which did not require a framework supporting its curves was invented by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]].  To transport the large stones to the construction site, Brunelleschi invented a unique boat capable of moving heavy cargo upriver and was granted exclusive rights to use his boat to move heavy loads, patent rights.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Patenting Art and Entertainment by Gregory Aharonian and Richard Stim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 15th century – [[Linear perspective]] was invented with work by Filippo Brunelleschi, and a treatise on perspective theory by [[Leon Battista Alberti]].   Perspective is a method for depicting the illusion of three-dimensions on a two-dimensional surface.&lt;ref&gt;ArtLex at www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Li.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1420 – The use of a single, consistent light source in painting with figures painted to appear three-dimensional was invented by the Italian artist [[Masaccio]] (Tommaso di Giovanni).  See his 1427 painting, "Tribute Money".
* 1485 – [[Sfumato]], a painting technique in which an atmospheric or blurry effect is created with minute transitions between color areas, was invented by Leonardo da Vinci.  Sfumato is seen in Leonardo's "Virgin on the Rocks" and "[[Mona Lisa]]".
* 1503 – [[Surrealism]] was invented by Flemish artist [[Hieronymus Bosch]] with his triptych "[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]".
* 1774 – [[Jasperware]], a dense vitreous pottery that could be turned on a lathe, was invented by [[Josiah Wedgwood]].
* 1816 – The photograph was invented by Joseph [[Nicephore Niepce]] using paper coated with [[silver chloride]] "fixed" with nitric acid.
* 1816 – a resolution contrast technique of painting and drawing was invented by [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] who used it to depict faces in high resolution with the rest of the image in low resolution, as for example in his drawing "Mrs. Charles Badham".
* 1861 – The color photograph was invented by physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]].
* 1863 – Multiple subject painting was invented by [[Édouard Manet]].  His "[[Le dejeuner sur l'herbe]]" presents four disconnected figures not looking at one another, lighted from different directions.  Dejeuner sur l'herbe also has a disconnected background-to-foreground perspective that eliminates the middle ground.
* 1865 – [[Chromolithograph]] prints were invented by [[Jules Chéret]].
* 1872 – Serial photomontage, the precursor to [[motion pictures]], was invented by [[Eadweard Muybridge]] and [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] by using multiple cameras to photograph moving objects.
* 1873 – Nonlinear horizon lines were invented by Édouard Manet, eliminating the horizon line in his 1874 painting "Boating".
* 1882 – Multiple time depiction was invented by Édouard Manet in his ''"[[A Bar at the Folies-Bergère]]"'', which depicts a bar scene from two points in space at two different moments in time.
* 1884 – [[Pointillism]] was invented by [[Georges Seurat]], who created entire paintings using small dots of pure unmixed color.
* 1886 – [[Trompe l'oeil]] was invented by [[William Michael Harnett]], an American painter.
* 1888 – A technique of portraying a subject from different perspectives and of distorting subject matter in painting was invented by [[Paul Cézanne]].
* 1891 – A technique of unfreezing time in still images was invented by [[Claude Monet]], who painted the same subject at many different times during the day, showing how it appeared differently largely due to the change in natural light.  He painted the cathedral at Rouen at 40 different times of the day and he painted the same haystack at 20 different moments in a year.
* 1902- A technique of indeterminate time was invented in painting by Paul Cézanne in his painting "Mont Sainte-Victorie", in which the sources and direction of light are not discernible.
* 1902 – The [[teddy bear]] was invented by Morris and Rose Michtom based on a cartoon of a bear saved by President Theodore Roosevelt.
* 1903 – The 3-D (three-dimensional) movie was invented by [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]] with their one-minute film "L’Arrivée du Train".
* 1904 – [[Fauvism]] was invented by [[Henri Matisse]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[André Derain]] and others.
* 1907 – A variety of special effects for film were invented by [[Georges Méliès]] in his film ''[[Tunneling the English Channel]]'', including stop-motion photography, split-screen photography, [[stop action animation]] and the combination of live action with full-scale mechanical backgrounds.
* 1915 – The multistable image was invented by W. E. Hill, with his drawing "My Wife and My Mother-in-Law", an image that can present either a young woman or an older woman.&lt;ref&gt;''Patenting Art and Entertainment'' by Gregory Aharonian and Richard Stim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1908 to 1917 – [[Cubism]] was invented by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]].  In Cubist artworks, the subject, whether it be a figure or a still life, is broken up and reassembled, and presented from multiple views simultaneously.  Cubism revolutionized western art, and influenced other art forms like music and literature.
* 1912 – [[Collage]] was invented by Picasso with his "Still Life with Chair Caning".  Attaching a material from the real world that was not ever used in high art into a painting violated what was previously considered the integrity of the artwork.  Collage was a new process for making art, a new art form, and it expanded the definition of art.
* 1912 – The [[Construction]] was invented by Picasso when he created "Guitar" in 1912 by joining parts together.  This additive image-making process was new to western sculpture which was previously made using subtractive processes like carving stone or wood, or modeling clay which may have then been cast in metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moodbook.com/history/modernism/pablo-picasso.html |title=Pablo Picasso. Art, life, and world of modern |publisher=Moodbook.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1917 – the [[Readymade]] was invented and exhibited by [[Marcel Duchamp]], "The Fountain" an upturned urinal signed by the artist.  The Readymade expanded the definition of art and of an artist.&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=11&amp;region=na#/Key-Events |title=The United States and Canada, 1900 A.D.–present &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1917 – [[De Stijl]] a kind of art based on pure geometry was invented by [[Theo van Doesburg]].
* 1926 – [[Science fiction]] movies were invented by [[Fritz Lang]] with his movie ''Metropolis'', which incorporates dynamic visual and special effects.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
* 1928 – [[Welded sculpture]], a new medium, a new process and a new art form, was invented by Pablo Picasso and Julio Gonzalez, opening up the solid form of sculpture to negative space and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;World History of Art by Hugh Honour, Laurence King Publishing 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; within a [[school]].&lt;ref name="Gamoran"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Teachers,Schools,andSociety/&gt; It may be referred to as '''streaming''' or '''phasing''' in certain schools.

In a tracking system, the entire school population is assigned to classes according to whether the students' overall achievement is above average, normal, or below average.  Students attend academic classes only with students whose overall academic achievement is the same as their own.

== Description ==
Ability grouping is ''not'' synonymous with tracking.&lt;ref&gt;Slavin, R. E. (1987). Ability grouping: A best-evidence synthesis. Review of Educational Research, 57, 293–336.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tracking differs from ability grouping by scale and permanence.  Ability groups are small, informal groups formed within a single classroom.  Assignment to an ability group is often short-term (never lasting longer than one school year), and varies by subject.&lt;ref name="Gamoran"/&gt;  Assignment to an ability group is made by (and can be changed at any time by) the individual teacher, and is usually not recorded in student records.  For example, a teacher may divide a typical mixed-ability classroom into three groups for a mathematics [[lesson]]:  those who need to review basic facts before proceeding, those who are ready to learn new material, and those who need a challenging assignment.  For the next lesson, the teacher may revert to whole-class, mixed-ability instruction, or may assign students to different groups.

==History in the United states==

=== Background ===
Tracking and its various modifications are among the predominant organizing practices of American public schools, and have been an accepted feature of the country's schools for nearly a century.&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;Rubin, B. (2008). Detracking in Context: How Local Constructions of Ability Complicate Equity-Geared Reform. Teachers College Record. Retrieved from: [http://www.tcrecord.org/printcontent.asp?contentID14603]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming into use at a time when schools were enrolling growing numbers of immigrant children as the result of compulsory schooling laws, tracking was adopted as a means of sorting those children viewed as having limited preparation or capacity for schooling from native children.  Unfortunately, however, tracking quickly took on the appearance of internal segregation.&lt;ref name="Wheelock"&gt;Wheelock, A. (1992). Crossing the tracks: How "untracking" can save America's schools. New York: New Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The types of tracks have changed over the years. Traditionally, there were academic, general, and [[Vocational school|vocational]] tracks, identified by the kind of preparation they provide.  By the 1920s, some schools had developed up to eight distinctly labeled tracks that represented particular curricular programs that reflected an assessment of students’ probable social and vocational futures.&lt;ref name="Wheelock" /&gt;

Many secondary schools now base track levels on course difficulty, with tracks such as basic, honors, or college-prep.&lt;ref name="Hallinan"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hallinan | first=Maureen | year=1994 | title=Tracking: From Theory to Practice | journal=Sociology of Education | volume=67 | issue=2 | pages=79–84 | doi=10.2307/2112697 | jstor=2112697 | publisher=Sociology of Education, Vol. 67, No. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Public schools might track in terms of high, average, or lower ability.  As noted by Oakes and Martin, "school policies determine three structural qualities of the tracking system: ''extensiveness'' (the number of subjects tracked and the type of distinct curricula offered); ''specificity'' (the number of track levels offered); and ''flexibility'' (whether students move from one track to another)".&lt;ref&gt;Oakes, Jeannie and Lipton Martin. "Tracking and Ability Grouping: A structural Barrier to Access and Achievement." Goodlad, John I. and Pamela Keating."Access to Knowledge." New York: College Entrance Examination Board, 1994. 187–204&lt;/ref&gt;  Although, in theory, track assignment is based on academic ability, other factors often influence placement.

===Origins of race-based tracking in school desegregation===
The ''Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka'' Supreme Court ruling of 1954 determined that the separate school statute established by ''Plessy v. Ferguson'' was unconstitutional, but a plan was not set forth for desegregating schools until the following year with the ''Brown II'' case. For schools in most southern regions of the United States, integration did not occur until the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mickelson|first=R. A.|title=The Academic Consequences of Desegregation and Segregation: Evidence from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools|journal=North Carolina Law Review|year=2003|volume=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mickelson (2003) stated that tracking was used as a tool to maintain white privilege by placing African-American students in lower academic tracks in Charlotte, North Carolina public schools after the ''Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg'' desegregation ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mickelson|first=R. A.|title=The Academic Consequences of Desegregation and Segregation: Evidence from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools|journal=North Carolina Law Review|year=2003|volume=81|pages=1514–1562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haney (1978) did a historical analysis on the negative effects of desegregation on African-American educators.&lt;ref&gt;Haney, J. E. (1978). The Effects of the Brown Decision of Black Educators. The Journal of Negro Education, 47(1), 88–95.&lt;/ref&gt; At the secondary school level, African-American teachers or less qualified white teachers were assigned to teach African American students. Teachers in lower tracks were also found to be less organized in preparing lessons and taught fewer concepts to students (Oakes, 1987).&lt;ref&gt;Oakes, J. (1987). Tracking in Secondary Schools: A Contextual Perspective. [[Educational Psychologist (journal)|Educational Psychologist]], 22(2), 129–153.&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of race-based tracking actually reach as far back as the federal court ruling in ''Roberts v. The City of Boston'' in 1850, a case that upheld separate school curriculums for blacks and whites on the belief in inherent racial differences in intelligence (Harvard Law Review, 1989).&lt;ref&gt;(1989). Teaching Inequality: The Problem of Public School Tracking. Harvard Law Review, 102(8), 1318–1341.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid- to late-1980s, there were a few federal court cases in the Mississippi and Georgia the involved unfair race-based tracking in school systems. ''Quarles v. Oxford Municipal Separate School District'', ''NAACP v. Georgia'', and ''Montgomery v. Starkville Municipal Separate School District'' each ruled in favor of school districts based on the argument that socioeconomic status was a legitimate reason for tracking. Courts also held the belief that racial discrimination in education was a thing of the past by the 1980s (Harvard Law Review, 1989). Unfortunately, in rural areas of Mississippi and Georgia, African-Americans were made of a large proportion of low income students, placing them in lower academic tracks.

As late as 2009, Childers (in press) found that in a successful Ohio high school that was majority African-American, students of color were still placed in lower academic tracks at a rate that did not reflect the student population.&lt;ref&gt;Childers, S. M. (2011). Getting in trouble: Feminist post-critical policy ethnography in an urban school. Journal of Qualitative Inquiry.&lt;/ref&gt; The argument for the proliferation of African-Americans in lower tracks was student choice rather than racially based practices of administrators (Childers, in press).

==Track assignment==
The ways by which students are assigned to tracks differs both between and within schools. Today, it is less common for schools to rigidly track students in all subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tracking Inequality: Stratification and Mobility in American High Schools|last=Lucas|first=Samuel|publisher=Teachers College Press|year=1999|isbn=0-8077-3798-4|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Administrators and teachers in a given school may purposefully avoid using the term “tracking” to describe the organization of their school’s curriculum.  Yet, schools maintain a variety of policies that sort students into different programs of study including: test scores and grade requirements, pre- and co-requisite requirements, and teacher recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Sean|date=2007|title=The Contours of Tracking in North Carolina|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/214913|journal=High School Journal|volume=90|pages=15-31|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schools also use over-arching programs of study such as “college prep” as a guidance technique to track students. Non-academic factors such as schedule conflicts can limit students from taking courses of varying level as well.  Thus, while most systems allow for some amount of student and parent choice, this choice is constrained by course taking requirements and guidance policies.  Within the context of this system, researchers disagree over the extent to which highly involved parents intervene to give their own student a course taking advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Useem|first=E.|date=1992|title=Middle Schools and Math Groups: Parents' Involvement in Children's Placement|url=|journal=Sociology of Education|volume=65|pages=263-279|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelly|first=S.|date=2004|title=Do Increased Levels of Parental Involvement Account for Social Class Differences in Track Placement?|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X03000851|journal=Social Science Research|volume=33|pages=626-659|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, high school students were sorted into “business/vocational,” “general,” or the “college” track, which had profound implications for the nature and extent of academic course taking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making Inequality: The Hidden Curriculum of High School Tracking|last=Rosenbaum|first=James E.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1976|isbn=0-471-73605-8|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In more recent decades, vocational course taking has declined,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Career and Technical Education in the United States: 1990-2005 (NCES 2008-035).|last=Levesque|first=K. et al.|publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|year=2008|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while academic course taking has increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Domina, T.|first=&amp; Saldana, J.|date=2012|title=Does Raising the Bar Level the Playing Field? Mathematics Curricular Intensification in American High Schools, 1982-2004.|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/0002831211426347|journal=American Educational Research Journal|volume=49|pages=685-708|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Domina and Saldana (2012) report that the graduating class of 1982 took an average of 14.6 academic courses while the class of 2004 took 19.1 academic courses. Likewise, the percentage of students graduating with pre-calculus or calculus coursework increased from about 10.3% of students to 32.9% of students.  This increase in academic course taking, especially in the public sector, has narrowed the differences in academic rigor between high- and low-track students somewhat.  Academic intensification has also reduced differences in the academic experiences of public vs. private school students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carbonaro, W.|first=&amp; Covay, E.|date=2010|title=School Sector and Student Achievement in the Era of Standards Based Reforms|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0038040710367934|journal=Sociology of Education|volume=83|pages=160-182|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite some loosening of high school tracking systems, most schools remain highly differentiated, with policies that encourage students to take the same level of coursework in different subjects.  In a study of high school tracking policies in North Carolina, Kelly and Price (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelly, S.|first=&amp; Price, H.|date=2011|title=The Correlates of Tracking Policy: Opportunity Hoarding, Status Competition, or a Technical-Functional Explanation?|url=https://doi.org/10.3102%2F0002831210395927|journal=American Educational Research Journal|volume=48|pages=560-585|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; report that the typical school had five or more levels of mathematics, with some schools having three or more levels of Geometry alone.  Larger schools and schools with a greater diversity of student achievement level have more extensive tracking systems than smaller, homogenous schools.  In many schools the track assignment process remains a high stakes decision.

== Debate ==

===Advantages===
Proponents of tracking say that tracking has several important strengths.

==== Lessons in adequation with the ability level of the students ====
A major advantage of tracking is that it allows [[teacher]]s to better direct lessons toward the specific ability level of the students in each class.&lt;ref name="Ansalone"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ansalone | first= George | year=2003 | title=Poverty, Tracking, and the Social Construction of Failure: International Perspectives on Tracking | journal=Journal of Children &amp; Poverty | volume=9 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While tracking for regular instruction makes no real difference in scholastic achievement for low and average ability students, it does produce substantial gains for gifted students in tracks specially designed for the gifted and talented.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Karen B, Ph.D., ''The Relationship of Grouping Practices to the Education of the Gifted and Talented Learner'', (The National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented, 1991 ) p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracking meets the need for highly gifted students to be with their intellectual peers in order to be appropriately challenged and to view their own abilities more realistically.&lt;ref name="fiedler"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fiedler |first=Ellen D. |author2=Richard E. Lange |author3=Susan Winebrenner |year=2002 |title=In search of reality: unraveling the myths about tracking, ability grouping, and the gifted |journal=Roeper Review |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=108–11 |issn=0278-3193 |doi=10.1080/02783190209554142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracking can allow students to receive lessons targeted at their ability for each subject separately, attending lessons set at different levels at the same school. For example, a student at a higher level in math may attend a class with advanced math students, but if at a lower level in English they may be grouped with peers at their level in English.

Another positive aspect of tracking is that since it separates students by ability, students' work is only compared to that of similar-ability peers, preventing a possible lowering of their self-esteem that could result from comparisons with the work of higher ability students, or inflating the egos of the high-ability students when compared to low-ability, same-age students.  Being with students of similar ability could allow students to realistically compete against one another for the highest marks with a reasonable chance of reaching the top of a class.



==== Higher achievement of high-ability students ====
Supporters of tracking also note that it allows for higher achievement of high-ability students.&lt;ref name="Kulik2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kulik | first= James A. |author2=Chen-Lin C. Kulik  | year=1992 | title=Meta-analytic findings on grouping programs | journal=Gifted Children Quarterly | volume=36 | issue=2 | pages=73–77 | doi=10.1177/001698629203600204}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kulik and Kulik (1992) found that high-ability students in tracked classes achieved more highly than similar-ability students in non-tracked classes. Similarly, Rogers (1991) recommends that gifted and talented students spend the majority of their school day with ability peers.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, ''The Relationship..."''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 and 1990, the Kuliks also found a moderate improvement in attitude toward subject material for ''all'' ability levels.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor of ability grouping that has been advocated is the Joplin Plan that refers directly to ability grouping for reading. These groups are generally more interchangeable and less defined.&lt;ref name="Kulik2" /&gt;
In another study, Argys, Rees, and Brewer (1996) found that high-track students’ achievement dropped when lower-ability students were integrated into the same class.&lt;ref name="Argys"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Argys | first= L. M. |author2=Rees, D. I. |author3=Brewer, D. J.  | year= 1996 | title= Detracking America's Schools: Equity at Zero Cost? | journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management | volume=15 | issue=4 | pages= 623–645 | doi= 10.1002/(SICI)1520-6688(199623)15:4&lt;623::AID-PAM7&gt;3.0.CO;2-J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of these studies suggest that tracking is beneficial to high-track students.  Tracking can also encourage low-ability students to participate in class since tracking separates them from intimidation of the high-ability students.&lt;ref name="Slavin1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slavin|first=Robert E.|year=1990|title=Achievement Effects of Ability Grouping in Secondary Schools: A Best-Evidence Synthesis|journal=Review of Educational Research|volume=60|issue=3|pages=471–499|doi=10.3102/00346543060003471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some supporters of tracking also view tracking as an effective means of allocation since it helps direct students into specific areas of the [[labor market]].&lt;ref name="Ansalone" /&gt;

Rogers classifies tracking as one of ten types of grouping.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Karen B, Ph.D., ''Re-forming Gifted Education'' (Great Potential Press, Scottsdale, AZ, 2002), pp. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;  High ability groups are often assigned special work that is more advanced than that of the other students in the class. For gifted children, such advanced work contributes to their social and emotional well-being.&lt;ref&gt;The Social and Emotional Development of Gifted Children: What Do We Know?, Edited by Maureen Neihart, Sally M. Reis, Nancy M. Robinson, and Sidney M. Moon; National Association of Gifted Children (Prufrock Press, Inc.), 2002, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===

==== Heterogeneity inside tracks ====
Despite the positive aspects of tracking, some scholars have noted limitations of the system.  Tracking often does not work as effectively as it should because of the composition of the tracks.  In practice, tracks are generally not as homogeneous as they could be
(although they are more homogenous than a non-tracking system, which randomly assigns students to classrooms), so some of the potential benefits can't be fully exploited.&lt;ref name="Hallinan" /&gt;

Even when tracks initially are nearly homogeneous in students' academic abilities, heterogeneity can develop over time, since students learn at different rates.  Some systems reassess all students periodically to keep students of comparable ability together as they progress.

==== Racial and social discrimination ====
Low-track classes tend to be primarily composed of low-income students, usually [[minorities]], while upper-track classes are usually dominated by students from socioeconomically successful groups.&lt;ref name="Hyland"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hyland | first=N. | year=2006 | title= Detracking in the Social Studies: A Path to a More Democratic Education? | journal=Theory into Practice | volume=45 | issue=1 | pages=64–71 | doi= 10.1207/s15430421tip4501_9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Jeannie Oakes theorized that the disproportionate placement of poor and minority students into low tracks does not reflect their actual learning abilities. Rather, she argues that the [[ethnocentric]] claims of [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]]s and the [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|Anglo-Saxon]]-driven Americanization movement at the turn of the century combined to produce a strong push for "industrial" schooling, ultimately relegating the poorer minority students to [[vocational education|vocational programs]] and a differentiated curriculum which she considered a lingering pattern in 20th century schools.&lt;ref name="Oakes2"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Oakes | first=Jeannie | year=1987 | title=Tracking in Secondary Schools: A Contextual Perspective | publisher=Santa Monica, CA: Rand Corp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Teachers appointment to classes ====
There is evidence to support the assertion that the appointment of teachers to classes is disproportionate.  The most-experienced, highest-status teachers are often assigned to teach high-track classes, whereas less-experienced teachers are usually assigned to low-track classes.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Davis | first=D. G. | year=1986 | title=A pilot study to assess equality in selected curricular offerings across three diverse schools in a large urban school district: A search for methodology. | journal=Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association, San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teachers of the high-track courses were found to be more enthusiastic in teaching, better at providing explanations, and more organized than teachers of low-track courses.&lt;ref name="Oakes2"/&gt;

==== Curricula ====
Scholars have also found that [[curricula]] often vary widely among tracks, as might be expected.&lt;ref name="Ansalone" /&gt;  While the enrichment and/or acceleration of curricula is considered to be a major benefit to gifted and talented students.,&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, ''The Relationship...'', p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; lessons taught in low-track classes often lack the engagement and comprehensiveness of the high-track lessons, reflecting their more remedial nature.

This can put low-track students at a disadvantage for college acceptance because they often do not gain the knowledge and skills of the upper-track students, presuming they could and would if not taught under a tracked system.  Oakes (1985) found that in high-track classes, teachers often used course materials and taught concepts which required extensive critical-thinking skills, whereas teachers in low-track classes tended to draw heavily from workbooks and rarely assign work that required critical thinking.&lt;ref name="Oakes1"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Oakes | first=Jeannie | year=1985 | title=Distribution of Knowledge | journal=Keeping Track: How Schools Structure Inequality | publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "But tracking described by Oakes in 1985 had little to do with educating gifted and talented children."&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, ''Re-forming...'', p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, curricula of high-track courses are much more intensive and in-depth than those of low-track courses, as would be expected.&lt;ref name="Spade_etc"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Spade |first= J. Z. |author2=Columba, L. |author3=Vanfossen, B. E.  | year=1997 | title=Tracking in Mathematics and Science: Courses and Course-Selection Procedures | journal=Sociology of Education | volume=70 | issue=2 | pages=108–127 | doi=10.2307/2673159 | jstor=2673159 | publisher=Sociology of Education, Vol. 70, No. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers reported spending less time addressing disciplinary issues in high-track classrooms than in low-track classes.&lt;ref name="Hallman_etc"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hallman |first= S. |author2=Ireson, J.  | year=2005 | title= Secondary school teachers' pedagogic practices when teaching mixed and structured ability classes | journal=Research Papers in Education | volume=20 | pages=3–24 | doi=10.1080/0267152052000341318}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connection between low-track students and perceived behavioral concerns has been reported frequently.&lt;ref name="Oakes3"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Oakes | first=Jeannie | year=2005 | title= Keeping track: How schools structure inequality (2nd ed.) | publisher=New Haven, CT: Yale University}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teachers in these instances often suggest that more time is required to promote proper student behavior over the development of [[critical thinking]] and independent learning.

==== Social effects and stigmatization ====
Some studies suggest that tracking can influence students' [[peer groups]] and attitudes regarding other students.  Gamoran's study (1992) shows that students are more likely to form friendships with other students in the same tracks than students outside of their tracks.&lt;ref name="gamoran2"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gamoran | first=Adam |year=1992 | title=The Variable Effects of High School Tracking | journal=American Sociological Review | volume=57 | issue=6 | pages=812–828 | doi=10.2307/2096125 | jstor=2096125 | publisher=American Sociological Review, Vol. 57, No. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since low-class and minority students are overrepresented in low tracks with Whites and Asians generally dominating high tracks, interaction among these groups can be discouraged by tracking.&lt;ref name="Khmelkov"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Khmelkov | first=V. |author2=Maureen Hallinan  | year=1999 | title=Organizational Effects on Race Relations in Schools | journal=Journal of Social Issues | volume=55 | issue=4 | pages=627–645 | doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00139}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no research showing an academic benefit to low track students from such interaction.

Tracking can also result in a [[stigmatization]] of low-track students.&lt;ref name="Hallinan"/&gt;  In some cases, this stigmatization is thought to have a negative impact on students' academic performance and to influence students' attitudes.&lt;ref name="Hallinan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamoran2"/&gt;  In one study, it was found that, among low-achieving students, students in tracked classes were more likely than students in non-tracked classes to believe that "their fate was out of their hands".&lt;ref name="B&amp;S2"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Braddock | first=J. H. |author2=R. E. Slavin  | year=1992 | title=Why Ability Grouping Must End: Achieving Excellence and Equity in American Education | journal=Paper presented at the Common Destiny Conference, Johns Hopkins University}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Carol Dweck]], this could be because their teachers impose upon them a 'fixed mindset,' but it is not an inherent attribute of tracking itself.&lt;ref&gt;Dweck, C. S. (2006). ''Mindset: The new psychology of success''. New York: Random House. p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dweck implies that teachers who promote a [[growth mindset]] could stimulate students to greater academic achievement regardless of tracking. So whether a fixed mindset is predictive of, or resulting from, a low track assignment is unknown.

The effects of social stigmatization can be some of the worst outcomes for students in lower academic tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oakes|first=J.|author2=Guiton, G. |title=Matchmaking: The dynamics of high school tracking decisions|journal=[[American Educational Research Journal]]|year=1995|volume=32|issue=1|pages=3–33|doi=10.3102/00028312032001003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schafer and Olexa (1971) interviewed high school students in lower academic tracks to examine the effects of tracking on self-esteem and perceived academic competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schafer|first=W. E.|title=Tracking and opportunity|year=1971|publisher=Chandler|location=Scranton, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that students lost confidence in their abilities by their placements in low-ability classes in which teacher expectations for them were low.

These dilemmas were very common as students made transitions to new schools (e.g., elementary to middle school, middle to high school). The tracking of African-American students in elementary schools reflected remnants of early desegregation in which African-American secondary school teachers were demoted to teaching in lower grades (Haney, 1978). In these elementary schools, class-based tracking disproportionately placed African-American students in lower tracks with African-American teachers, regardless of ability. In transitions to middle and high school, tracking by ability created a division among these students and stripped students in lower tracks of their perceived academic efficacies.

Goodlad (1983) and Oakes (1985) found that students in lower tracks were more likely to drop out of school or participate in criminal activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodlad|first=J. I.|title=A place called school|year=1983|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oakes|first=J.|title=Keeping track: How schools structure inequality|year=1985|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of tracking would have said that students dropped out due to lack of ability, but Mickelson (2003) stated that students differed widely even within lower tracks. Even when students demonstrated high academic ability, it was virtually impossible to change their academic tracks without delaying high school graduation (Mickelson, 2003).

==International perspective==

=== Background ===
Across countries there are wide differences in the use of formal tracking systems.  Even though some countries track students into differing-ability schools by age 10, others such as the United States keep their entire secondary-school system  comprehensive. [[Eric Hanushek]] and [[Ludger Woessmann]]  identify the impact of tracking by comparing differences in student outcome between primary and secondary school across tracked and non-tracked systems.&lt;ref&gt;Eric A. Hanushek and Ludger Woessmann,  "Does educational tracking affect performance and inequality? Differences-in-differences evidence across countries." ''Economic Journal'' 116( 510), March 2006: C63-C76.&lt;/ref&gt; The results suggest that early tracking increases educational inequality. While less clear, there is also a tendency for early tracking to reduce mean performance.

=== Tracking by country ===
Tracking was once popular in English-speaking countries, but is less used now; tracking systems formed the basis of the [[Tripartite System]] in England and Wales until the 1970s, and in [[Northern Ireland]] until 2009.

In the UK the term "Tracking" refers to recording data as to individual pupils progress, the term "Streaming" commonly translates to the meaning of Tracking in the sense of this article.

Weak tracking systems have been used in American schools.  In this approach, local schools assign students to classrooms according to their overall achievement, so that a given classroom is primarily composed of students with either high, average, or low academic achievement.

[[Education in Germany|Germany]] uses a tracked system.  In Germany, students' achievements in their last of generally four years of primary school determine the type of secondary school they will be permitted to attend, and therefore the type of education they will receive.

A tracking system has been in place since the advent of modern [[education in the Netherlands]]. After it was relaxed in the 70s and 80s, the tracking system has been gaining substantial strength again since the late 1990s.

==''A Small Act'' and similarities to class-based tracking abroad==
The 2010 HBO documentary, ''A Small Act'', documented the difficulty of Kenyan students being able to afford attending secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Arnold|first=Jennifer|title=A Small Act|url=http://www.asmallact.com/index.php|publisher=Home Box Office|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These elite schools were viewed as pathway to law school, medical school, and other forms of advanced education. Students who were kicked out of school for insufficient funds were fated to lives of poverty. In Kenya, having only a primary school education prepared one for menial labor, while secondary school equated to future social mobility for poor Kenyan children.

The Kenyan system of education closely mirrored tracking in American high schools where students in college-preparatory tracks were able to attend four-year universities immediately after graduation and vocationally tracked students could only enter community colleges and technical schools. Middle-class Kenyans were more likely to complete secondary schools and attend college, similar to college-preparatory students in the United States. Despite displaying promising academic ability, both low track students in the United States and poor children in Kenya can be at disadvantages in their educational advancement. For those in the United States, they acquire vocational skills at the sacrifice of reaching their full academic potential and the job security of a college education. The prospects for poor children in Kenya are even worse, having acquired few job skills in their primary school education.

Poor children in Kenya did have the opportunity to gain admission to secondary schools through merit scholarships, which required that students attained satisfactory scores on entrance examinations. There were indeed opportunities for bright poor children, but merit scholarships were limited in the number of students who could be awarded. In the United States, bright students in vocational tracks can enroll in two-year universities, but they lack the scholarships and post-secondary funding of their college-preparatory counterparts. Vocational students negotiate with the burden of scant financial support for college, and poor Kenyan children have the stress of passing entrance examinations even if they have academic ability similar to that of middle-class  children or those in college-preparatory tracks.

===Detracking===

Detracking occurs when students are deliberately positioned into classes of mixed ability.&lt;ref name=Rubin/&gt; As opposed to tracking, students are no longer placed in groups based upon academic achievement or ability.&lt;ref name="Hallinan, M. 1005"&gt;Hallinan, M. (1005) Tracking and Detracking Practices: Relevance for Learning. Transforming Schools. {{ISBN|978-0-8153-1257-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracking can be associated with giving students in low-track classes less resources, fewer experienced teachers, low expectations, and unchallenging curricula.&lt;ref name=Brewer&gt;Brewer, D., &amp; Rees, D. (1995). Detracking America's Schools: The Reform without Cost? Phi Delta Kappan, 77. Retrieved from: [https://www.questia.com/googlescholar.qst?docld=5001654255] Online: [http://www.cog.brown.edu/courses/63/Brewer_detracking.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents for detracking believe that low-track students will greatly benefit in school achievement if they are mixed in with high-track students.&lt;ref name=Argys /&gt;

===Benefits of detracking===
Critics of tracking such as [[Kevin G. Welner|Kevin Welner]] say that detracking will help close the class-based and race-based [[achievement gap]].&lt;ref name=Burris/&gt;  Often students in low-track classes are disadvantaged racial and ethnic minority students.&lt;ref name=Burris&gt;Burris, C., &amp; Welner, K. (2005). A Special Section on the Achievement Gap-Closing the Achievement Gap by Detracking. Phi Delta Kappan, 86. Retrieved from https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=MY2YJljsCFJyzltpDmFp7fMbLNVjTS7WswJfvTK49FZJC29k057Z!1380883283!427202863?docId=5009329171&lt;/ref&gt; Those in favor of detracking say that detracking challenges social views about [[race and intelligence]].&lt;ref name=Oaks/&gt;

Tracking has been shown to produce less academic achievement for low-ability students, and higher academic achievement for high-ability students; de-tracking would increase the achievement of the worst students and harm the achievement of the best students.&lt;ref name=Brewer/&gt;  Critics say that not challenging all students with the most advanced curriculum results in overall low student educational achievement,&lt;ref name=Burris/&gt; and that students in low tracks do not learn as much as their peers in higher tracks, e.g., advanced mathematics.&lt;ref name=Oaks&gt;Oakes, J., &amp; Stuart, A. (2000). Change Agentry and the Quest for Equity: Lessons from Detracking Schools. The Sharpe Edge of Educational Change: Teaching, Leading, and the Realities of Reform. {{ISBN|978-0-7507-0865-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers typically have higher expectations for students in high-track classes and low expectations for students in low-tracked classes, which affects the self-image of students.&lt;ref name="Hallinan, M. 1005"/&gt;

===Concerns of detracking===
Detracking has been proven to reduce the achievement of students who would otherwise be placed  in high-track classes.&lt;ref name=Brewer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burris/&gt; Parents of high-ability students and other proponents of tracking say that [[gifted education|academically gifted students]] should have access to classes that maximize their potential.&lt;ref name=Oaks/&gt; Detracking holds back high-ability students because teachers must reduce the amount and complexity of material so that all students in the class, including low-ability students, can understand it.&lt;ref name=Brewer /&gt; Putting all students together in a heterogeneous group makes the teacher's job more difficult by increasing the range of performance of the students in a class.&lt;ref name=Brewer /&gt;

The teachers' perception of a students' academic abilities determines how detracking is carried out in the classroom.&lt;ref name=Rubin/&gt; For example, in a school with many disadvantaged students, teachers assumed most students had low ability, and therefore the classroom curriculum was easier than what the students were capable of achieving.&lt;ref name=Rubin/&gt; On the other side, in a wealthy school, teachers typically assumed students were college-bound and intelligent, and followed a creative and challenging curriculum.&lt;ref name=Rubin/&gt;

==Proposed reforms==
Maureen Hallinan offers many suggestions for reforming the tracking system and counterbalancing its perceived negative consequences.&lt;ref name="Hallinan"/&gt; Although tracking can [[wikt:segregate|segregate]] students by race and [[socioeconomic status]], she says that, by ensuring that students are engaged in integrated settings{{Clarify|pre-text=such as|date=February 2010}} during the school day, some of the negative effects of the segregation{{Clarify|pre-text=such as|date=February 2010}} could be avoided. Some studies suggest that low-track students often have slower academic growth than high-track students, but Hallinan says that providing more-engaging lessons in class, altering assumptions about students, and raising requirements for students' performance could help.  Research is needed in this area to test her hypotheses. In order to prevent stigmatization of low-track students, Hallinan suggests that schools challenge low-track students to achieve highly and should offer public rewards for gains in academic achievement.&lt;ref name="Hallinan"/&gt; Such rewards would be necessary in all tracks to avoid the perception of unfairness.

Heterogeneous class assignment with part-time homogeneous groupings is one possible compromise.

Allen Graubard suggests that creating "small schools" within larger school systems would be a progressive proposal for reformation. The school experience could be reformatted by having students select programs themselves that cover both traditional learning as well as vocational real-world experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graubard|first=Allen|date=September 2004|title=Progressive Education and the Tracking Debate|url=|journal=The Radical Teacher |volume=70|pages=32–39|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reform would also benefit from improving the instruction that is provided to students within the classroom. In order to have all students benefit from eliminating tracking, teachers must have the tools to teach all students, as well as the tools to decrease stigma that may arise from students who feel that they are at different learning levels from their peers. There is evidence that as it stands, many teachers are not given proper training to teach/guide differentiated classrooms. In order to successfully accomplish a reformation of the educational experience, teachers and faculty must be provided the proper time and support to complete training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Modica|first=Marianne|date=September 2015|title=My Skin Color Stops Me From Learning: Tracking, Identity, and Student Dynamics in a Racially Mixed School|url=|journal=[[International Journal of Multicultural Education]]|volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=76–90|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Unresolved complex mixture''' (also UCM or hump) is a feature frequently observed in [[Gas chromatography|gas chromatographic]] (GC) data of crude oils and extracts from organisms exposed to oil.&lt;ref name="Gough"&gt;Gough, M. A. &amp; Rowland, S. J. Characterization of Unresolved Complex-Mixtures of Hydrocarbons in Petroleum. Nature 344, 648-650 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for the UCM hump appearance is that GC cannot resolve and identify a significant part of the hydrocarbons in crude oils. The resolved components appear as peaks while the UCM appears as a large background/platform. In non-biodegraded oils the UCM may comprise less than 50% of the total area of the chromatogram, while in biodegraded oils this figure can rise to over 90%. UCMs are also observed in certain refined fractions such as lubricating oils &lt;ref name="Gough" /&gt; and references therein.

One reason why it is important to study the nature of UCMs is that some have been shown to contain toxic components,&lt;ref name="Rowland"&gt;Rowland, S., Donkin, P., Smith, E. &amp; Wraige, E.

Analysis of the hydrocarbon fraction of crude oils by gas chromatography (GC) reveals a complex mixture containing many thousands of individual components.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, P. A., Lewis, C. A. &amp; Rowland, S. J. Isolation of individual hydrocarbons from the unresolved complex hydrocarbon mixture of a biodegraded crude oil using preparative capillary gas chromatography. Organic Geochemistry 36, 963-970 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  Components that are resolved by GC have been extensively studied e.g.&lt;ref&gt;Killops, S. D. &amp; Killops, V. J. An introduction to organic geochemistry (Longman, Harlow, England, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, despite the application of many analytical techniques the remaining components have, until very recently, proved difficult to separate due to the large numbers of co-eluting compounds.  Gas chromatograms of mature oils have prominent n-alkane peaks which distract attention from the underlying unresolved complex mixture (UCM) of hydrocarbons often referred to as the ‘hump’. Processes such as weathering and biodegradation result in a relative enrichment of the UCM component by removal of resolved components and the creation of new compounds.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, K. E., Walters, C. C. &amp; Moldowan, J. M. The biomarker guide: Volume 1, Biomarkers and Isotopes in the Environment and Human History (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been shown that both resolved and unresolved components of oils are subject to concurrent biodegradation,&lt;ref name="Gough" /&gt; i.e. it is not a sequential process, but due to the recalcitrant nature of some components, the rates of biodegradation of individual compounds greatly varies.  The UCM fraction often represents the major component of hydrocarbons within hydrocarbon-polluted sediments &lt;ref name="ScarlettA" /&gt; (see reference therein) and biota e.g.&lt;ref name="Rowland" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Donkin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, S.

==Weathering and biodegradion of oils within the marine environment==
Environmental UCMs result from highly degraded petroleum hydrocarbons and once formed they can stay largely unchanged in sediments for many years.  For example, in 1969 a diesel oil spill contaminated saltmarsh sediment within Wild Harbor River, US; by 1973 only a baseline hump was observed, which remained largely unchanged within the anaerobic sediment for 30.&lt;ref name="Reddy"&gt;Reddy, C. M. et al. The West Falmouth oil spill after thirty years: the persistence of petroleum hydrocarbons in marsh sediments. Environmental Science &amp; Technology 36, 4754-4760 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  In a study of the potential for UCM-dominated oil to be further degraded, it was concluded that even using bacteria specifically adapted for complex UCM hydrocarbons in conjunction with nutrient enrichment, biodegradation rates would still be relatively slow.&lt;ref&gt;McGovern, E. (Marine Institute Fisheries Research Centre, Dublin, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;  Bacterial degradation of hydrocarbons is complex and will depend on environmental conditions (e.g. aerobic or anaerobic, temperature, nutrient availability, available species of bacteria etc.).

==Analysis of UCM hydrocarbons==
A relatively recent analytical tool that has been used for the separation of UCMs is comprehensive two-dimensional GC [[GCxGC|(GC×GC)]]
.  This powerful technique, introduced by Liu and Phillips &lt;ref&gt;Liu, Z. Y. &amp; Phillips, J. B. Comprehensive 2-Dimensional Gas-Chromatography Using an on-Column Thermal Modulator Interface. Journal of Chromatographic Science 29, 227-231 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; combines two GC columns with different separation mechanisms: typically a  primary column that separates compounds based on volatility coupled to a second short column that separates by polarity.  The two columns are connected by a modulator, a device that traps, focuses and re-injects the peaks that elute from the first column into the second column.  Each peak eluting from the first column (which may be a number of co-eluting peaks) is further separated on the second column.  The second separation is rapid, allowing the introduction of subsequent fractions from the first column without mutual interference.  Dallüge et al.&lt;ref&gt;Dallüge, J., Beens, J. &amp; Brinkman, U. A. T. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography: a powerful and versatile analytical tool. Journal of Chromatography A 1000, 69-108 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; reviewed the principles, advantages and main characteristics of this technique.  One of the main advantages is the very high separation power, making the technique ideal for unravelling the composition of complex mixtures. Another important feature of GC×GC is that chemically related compounds show up as ordered structures within the chromatograms, i.e. isomers appear as distinct groups in the chromatogram as a result of their similar interaction with the second dimension column phase.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, J. B. &amp; Beens, J. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography: a hyphenated method with strong coupling between the two dimensions. Journal of Chromatography A 856, 331-347 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of GC×GC for the characterization of complex petrochemical mixtures has been extensively reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;Adahchour, M., Beens, J., Vreuls, R. J. J. &amp; Brinkman, U. A. T. Recent developments in comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC x GC) III. Applications for petrochemicals and organohalogens. Trac-Trends in Analytical Chemistry 25, 726-741 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;   Most research into petrochemical hydrocarbons using GC×GC has utilised [[Flame ionization detector|flame ionisation detection]] (FID) but [[mass spectrometry]] (MS) is necessary to obtain the structural information necessary to identify unknown compounds. Currently, only [[Time-of-flight mass spectrometry|time-of-flight MS]] (ToF-MS) can deliver the high acquisition rates required to analyse GC×GC.

==Toxicity of UCM hydrocarbon components==
There is compelling evidence that components within some UCMs are toxic to marine organisms. The clearance rate (also known as feeding feed) of mussels was reduced by 40% following exposure to a monoaromatic UCM derived from a Norwegian crude oil.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; The toxicity of monoaromatic UCM components was further evidenced by an elegant set of experiments using transplantations of clean and polluted mussels.&lt;ref name="Donkin" /&gt; Recent analysis by GC×GC-ToF-MS of UCMs extracted from the mussel tissues, has shown that they contain a vast array of both known and unknown compounds.&lt;ref name="BoothA" /&gt; The comparative analysis of UCMs extracted from mussels known to possess high, moderate and low Scope for Growth (SfG), a measure of the capacity for growth and reproduction,&lt;ref&gt;Widdows, J. et al.  Measurement of stress effects (scope for growth) and contaminant levels in mussels (Mytilus edulis) collected from the Irish Sea. Marine Environmental Research 53, 327-356 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that branched alkylbenzenes represented the largest structural class within the UCM of mussels with low SfG; also, branched isomers of alkyltetralins, alkylindans and alkylindenes were prominent in the stressed mussels.&lt;ref name="BoothA" /&gt; Laboratory toxicity tests using both commercially available and specially synthesised compounds revealed that such branched alkylated structures were capable of producing the observed poor health of the mussels.&lt;ref name="BoothA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BoothB" /&gt; The reversible effects observed in mussels following exposure to the UCM hydrocarbons identified to date are consistent with non-specific narcosis (also known as baseline) mode of action of toxicity.&lt;ref name="ScarlettB" /&gt; There is no evidence that toxic UCM components can biomagnify through the food chain. Crabs (Carcinus maenas) that were fed a diet of mussels contaminated with environmentally realistic concentrations of branched alkylbenzenes, suffered behavioural disruption but only a small concentration of the compounds were retained in the midgut of the crabs.&lt;ref name="ScarlettC" /&gt; Within marsh sediments still contaminated with high concentrations of UCM hydrocarbons from the Florida barge oil spill in 1969 (see above,) the behaviour and feeding of  fiddler crabs (Uca pugnax) was reported to be affected.&lt;ref&gt;Culbertson, J. B. et al. Long-term biological effects of petroleum residues on fiddler crabs in salt marshes. Marine Pollution Bulletin 54, 955-962 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polar UCMs==
Much of the past research into the composition and toxicity of UCM hydrocarbons has been conducted by the [http://www.research.plymouth.ac.uk/pegg/  Petroleum and Environmental Geochemistry Group (PEGG)] at the University of Plymouth, UK. As well as the hydrocarbon UCM, oils also contain more polar compounds such as those containing oxygen, sulphur or nitrogen. These compounds can be very soluble in water and hence bioavailable to marine and aquatic organisms. Polar UCMs are present within produced waters from oil rigs and from oil sands processing. A polar UCM fraction extracted from North Sea oil produced water was reported to elicit hormonal disruption by way of both estrogen receptor agonist and androgen receptor agonist activity.&lt;ref name="Tollefsen" /&gt; Ongoing concern regarding the potential toxicity of components within [[Athabasca oil sands|Athabasca Oil Sands]] (Canada) tailings ponds has highlighted the need for identification of the compounds present. Until recently, such positive identification of individual so-called [[naphthenic acid]]s  from oil sands produced waters had so far eluded characterisation but recent research by PEGG presented at a SETAC conference in 2010 &lt;ref&gt;Rowland, S. J. in SETAC North America 31st Annual Meeting, Portland, U.S.A., 7–11 November 2010 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that, using a new GCxGC-TOF-MS, it was possible to resolve and identify a range of new compounds within such highly complex extracts. One group of compounds found to be present were tricyclic diamondoid acids.&lt;ref&gt;Rowland SJ, Scarlett AG, Jones D, West CE, Frank RA. Diamonds in the Rough: Identification of Individual Naphthenic Acids in Oil Sands Process Water. Environ Sci Technol: In Press, {{doi|10.1021/es103721b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These structures had previously not even been considered as naphthenic acids and  suggests an unprecedented degree of biodegradation of some of the oil in the oil sands.

The '''Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa''' (''[[Enuma Anu Enlil]]'' Tablet 63) refers to the record of astronomical observations of [[Venus]], as preserved in numerous [[cuneiform]] [[clay tablet|tablet]]s dating from the first millennium BC. It is believed that this astronomical record was first compiled during the reign of King [[Ammisaduqa]] (or Ammizaduga), the fourth ruler after [[Hammurabi]]. Thus, the origins of this text should probably be dated to around the mid-seventeenth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |first=Russell |last=Hobson |title=The Exact Transmission of Texts in the First Millennium B.C. |type=PhD thesis |publisher=[[University of Sydney]] |date=2009 |url=http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/5404/1/r-hobson-2009-thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (according to the [[Middle Chronology]]).

The tablet recorded the rise times of [[Venus]] and its first and last visibility on the horizon before or after sunrise and sunset (the [[heliacal risings]] and settings of Venus) in the form of lunar dates. These observations are recorded for a period of 21 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=John David |last=North |author-link=John North (historian) |title=Cosmos: an illustrated history of astronomy and cosmology |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |date=2008 |page=41 |isbn=0-226-59441-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The sources==
This Venus tablet is part of ''[[Enuma anu enlil]]'' ("In the days of Anu and Enlil"), a long text dealing with [[Babylonian astrology]], which mostly consists of [[omen]]s interpreting celestial phenomena.

The earliest copy of this tablet to be published, a 7th-century BC [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]],  part of the [[British Museum]] collections, was recovered from the [[Library of Ashurbanipal|library at Nineveh]]. It was first published in 1870 by Henry Creswicke Rawlinson and [[George Smith (assyriologist)|George Smith]] as ''Enuma Anu Enlil'' Tablet 63, in "Tablet of Movements of the Planet Venus and their Influences" (''The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia'', volume III).

As many as 20 copies of this text are currently on record, many of them fragmentary, falling into 6 groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Erica |last1=Reiner |author-link1=Erica Reiner |first2=David Edwin |last2=Pingree |author-link2=David Pingree |title=Babylonian planetary omens |volume=Volume 3 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] |date=1998 |isbn=90-5693-011-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest of these copies is believed to be Source "B", found at [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] in 1924. It was copied from a tablet written at Babylon while [[Sargon II]] was King of [[Assyria]] between 720 and 704 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Hermann |last1=Hunger |author-link1=Hermann Hunger |first2=David Edwin |last2=Pingree |author-link2=David Pingree |title=Astral sciences in Mesopotamia |series=Handbuch der Orientalistik |volume=Volume 44 |page=32 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] |date=1999 |isbn=90-04-10127-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
Several dates for the original observations, as contained in the tablet, were proposed early in the 20th century. The following dates, corresponding to the High, [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|Middle]], [[Short chronology timeline|Low]] and [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|Ultra-Low Chronologies]], were inferred for the beginning of the Venus observations: [[1702 BC]], [[1646 BC]], [[1582 BC]], 1550 BC, respectively.

The tablet's significance for corroborating [[Babylonia]]n chronology was first recognised by [[Franz Xaver Kugler]] in 1912, when he succeeded in identifying the enigmatic "Year of the Golden Throne" ("Venus" tablet K.160) as potentially the 8th year of the reign of Ammisaduqa, based on one of his year names. 
&lt;ref&gt;Franz Xaver Kugler, Sternkunde und Sterndienst in Babel - II. Buch: Natur, Mythus und Geschichte als Grundlagen babylonischer Zeitordnung, nebst eingehenden Untersuchungen der älteren Sternkunde und Meteorologie, 2. Teil. Heft 1, Aschendorff, 1912&lt;/ref&gt;
Since then, this 7th-century BC copy has been variously interpreted to support [[Chronology of the Ancient Orient|several chronologies]] in the [[2nd millennium BC]].

Many uncertainties remain about the interpretation of the record of astronomical observations of Venus, as preserved in these surviving tablets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |quote=We then discuss why the 56/64 year Venus cycle cannot be traced in the Venus Tablet and therefore cannot serve as an anchor for the search of chronologies. |last=Gurzadyan |first=V.

Problems of atmospheric refraction were addressed by [[Vahe Gurzadyan]] in a 2003 publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=V.

Also, the tables used to calculate the helical rising of Venus assume a rate at which the earth is slowing, a rate which is not certain, causing "clock-time errors".&lt;ref&gt;John D. Weir, The Pattern of Venus Tablet Solutions, JACF, vol. 7, pp.70-76, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
