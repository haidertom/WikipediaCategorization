      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21799">'''Affiliative conflict theory''' ('''ACT''') is a social psychological approach that encompasses [[interpersonal communication]] and has a background in [[nonverbal communication]].  This [[theory]] postulates that "people have competing needs or desires for intimacy and autonomy" (Burgoon, p.&amp;nbsp;30). In any relationship, people will negotiate and try to balance out their own behavioral acts of (approach and avoidance) to maintain a comfortable level of [[intimacy]].&lt;ref name=Burgoon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgoon|first=J.K.|title=Interpersonal Adaption: Dyadic Interaction Patterns.|journal=New York: Cambridge University Press|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Affiliative conflict theory (ACT), also referred to as equilibrium theory or model,&lt;ref name=Burgoon /&gt; was first introduced in the 1960s by [[Michael Argyle (psychologist)|Michael Argyle]]. His article "Eye Contact, Distance and Affiliation", co-authored with [[Janet Dean Fodor|Janet Dean]] was published in ''Sociometry'' in 1965, and has been used greatly as the base line for ACT. Michael Argyle had a long distinguished career in which he advanced the field of [[social psychology]]. His work on [[nonverbal communication]] greatly developed this [[theory]] and his book ''The Psychology of Interpersonal Behavior'' became an international bestseller in 1967. Argyle's curiosity regarding if [[social skills]] were learned in the same way as manual skills led him to research interpersonal behavior.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Throughout his life's work he had various associates (Argyle &amp; Dean, 1965; Argyle &amp; Lalljee &amp; Cook, 1968, Argyle &amp; Ingham, 1972; Argyle &amp; Ingham, Alkema &amp; McCallin, 1972); all of which worked to validate the [[theory]] through their focus on the relationship between visual behavior (nonverbal behavior) and interpersonal distance (Coutts, pg. 3). Visual behavior research studies deal with influence, and with attributions made by observers. This reflects psychological [[research]] on nonverbal cues.&lt;ref name=Coutts&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coutts|first=L. M.|title=Affiliative Conflict Theory: Exploration of the Notions of Intimacy Equilibrium and Behavioral Compensation|journal=Windsor: University of Windsor.|year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic concept of nonverbal behavior==

There are numerous behaviors that fall under nonverbal involvement.  The nonverbal includes [[distance]], [[gaze]], [[touch]], body orientation, body lean, facial expressiveness, talking duration, interruptions, postural openness, relational gestures, head nods, and paralinguistic cues such as [[rate (mathematics)|rate]] and [[tone (linguistics)|tone]], which are at least as important as the words spoken in communicating to others.&lt;ref name=Meh&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mehrabian|first=A.|title=Orientation behaviors and nonverbal attitude communication.|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1967|pages=324–332|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1967.tb01190.x|volume=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the basic study of nonverbal communications that was tested is the study of temporal patterning which is defined  as relation to events in the vocal-verbal channel, when the receiver looks for cues, responds to them, and interprets them, and other times when the same movement or configuration will be unnoticed or disregarded.&lt;ref name=Mortensen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mortensen|first=D.|title=Communication Theory|journal=New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also beliefs that some nonverbal involvement cues have been found to increase personal performance on tasks such as test, verbal encoding, and relationship building.

Along with nonverbal behavior, another basic concept to understand is immediacy. [[Immediacy (philosophy)|Immediacy]] is generally defined as the degree of directness and intensity of interaction between two entities, such as two people.&lt;ref name=Remland&gt;{{cite journal|last=Remland|first=M.|author2=Jones, T.|title=The effects of nonverbal involvement and communication apprehension on state anxiety, interpersonal attraction, and speech duration.|journal=Communication Quarterly|year=1989|volume=37|issue=3|pages=170–183|doi=10.1080/01463378909385538}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Immediacy of body orientation is defined as the percentage of the duration of communicator-addressee interaction during which the communicator's median plane" (i.e., the plane perpendicular to the communicator's chest) passes through the addressee's position.&lt;ref name=Remland /&gt; When discussing immediacy, you tend to look at the head orientation of a communicator towards his addressee or it may be defined as the percentage of the duration of communicator-addressee interaction during which the communicator's head is directed towards the addressee's position. Duration of interaction between two individuals is defined as the length of time during which the two individuals are in each other's presence.

==Argyle and Cook's modifications==

In 1976, Argyle and Cook modified and extended their original theory after concluding only partial support for compensation.

:o In their first modification they added:

::-  Form of address – emotional expression
::- Absence of physical barriers
::- Openness of posture
::- Friendliness&lt;ref name=Burgoon /&gt;

:o The second modification addressed:

::- Effects of social norms (environment) on how people interact or obtain equilibrium levels.
::-  For example, "a couple may have a mutually strong approach need, but may "constrain" their intimacy behaviors to a socially acceptable lever if they are in public."&lt;ref name=Burgoon /&gt;

:o The third modification addressed:

::- Acknowledges that reciprocity may occur in response to intimacy changes. (burgoon 32)

==Empirical support==

Many academic scholars have researched ACT. Joseph Cappella, Ira Firestone, and John Aiello are just a few scholars whose conclusions of ACT differed. The first scholar, Joseph Cappella, did thirty-six studies in his review that concluded that "increased proximity leads to compensatory responses on distancing, gaze, posture, body orientation, bodily activity, verbal output, and the like" (Burgoon, p.&amp;nbsp;33). His results also theorize that physical closeness create a discomfort in partners that then respond by "increasing physical distance or psychological distance" (Burgoon, p.&amp;nbsp;33) The second scholar, Ira Firestone is known for his research on Reconciling verbal and nonverbal models of dyadic communications.&lt;ref name=Firestone&gt;{{cite journal|title=none|last=Firestone|first=I.|journal=Reconciling Verbal and Nonverbal Models of Dyadic Commission|year=1977|volume=2|issue=1|pages=30–44|doi=10.1007/bf01127016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firestone's conclusion was opposite to Cappella's. He concluded in one of his reviews that responses to spatial adjustments had various results. "Spatial distance, posture, and visual behavior features of dyadic interaction appear to show complex interdependencies. Both facilitative and inhibitory relationships abound. Clearly, the conclusion that non-verbal approach by one party induces withdrawal by the other is unwanted" (Burgoon, p.&amp;nbsp;33). The third scholar, John Aiello came to a more tempered conclusion. His studies reflected that compensation is more common in stable relationships rather than developing ones. He also stated that "comfort-oriented models do not predict observable compensation as long as variations immediacy behaviors fall with in optimal distance range" (Burgoon, p.&amp;nbsp;33). The different conclusions between these three scholars can only give a partial and inconsistent support of ACT, with proximity being the most consistent elicitor of compensation.

==Recent modifications==
Further research has added the concepts of [[cognition]] and [[expectation (epistemic)|expectation]]s however its "reliance on the basic assumptions and elements of Act affirms its influential impact and some of the "truths" it has uncovered" (Burgoon, pg. 38). According to Judy Burgoon the, "most significant contributions have been the introduction of arousal or discomfort as a primary indicator of behavioral changes, and attention to compensation as one major interaction pattern in [[interpersonal communication]]" (Burgoon, pg. 37).

The concept of compensation was first introduced and added to the theory by Larry Coutts and Frank Schneider in 1976 in their ACT article that investigated the intimacy equilibrium and compensation hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Coutts2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coutts|first=L. M.|author2=Schneider|title=Affiliative Conflict Theory: An Investigation of the Intimacy Equilibrium and Compensation Hypothesis|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1976|pages=1135–1142|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.34.6.1135|volume=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent modifications of ACT, as seen in John Aiello and Donna Thompson's comfort model which came about in 1979,&lt;ref name=Ailloe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ailloe|first=J.|author2=Thompson, D.|title=Interpersonal Distance Preferences|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|year=1979|volume=4|issue=2|pages=113–118|doi=10.1007/bf01006355}}&lt;/ref&gt; was at odds with ACT's basic premise; due to the conclusion that discomfort is not the trigger for compensation. Because "discomfort is only activated when interaction behaviors become extreme" (Burgoon, pg. 36). Another modification was done by Knowles (1980, 1989) whom introduced the rubric of field theory. One important contribution is that "behavior is goal oriented and purposeful, not necessarily mindful (Burgoon, pg. 36) The environments impact on human behavior also added another addition to ACT, known as field theory. Field Theory shows, that approach and avoidance gradients draw people together and apart. Approach is the need and desires whereas avoidance comes from enduring features like the fear of rejection. In 1989, Knowles "reconceptualization of ACT is that people feel discomfort when their internal approach and avoidance gradients are not equal" (Burgoon, pg. 36). "Knowles also allows for constant redefinition of gradieSnts and thus a fluctuating equilibrium level" (Burgoon, pg. 37). The problems it creates for ACT is such that, if gradients fluctuate "from moment to moment" then accurate predictions appears limited" (Burgoon, pg. 37). An interesting notion to take from these modifications is that "even when we want to be intimate with another, the fear of being too intimate or being rejected (avoidance gradient) may lurk in the background as an influential factor determining behavior" (Burgoon, pg. 37).

==Equilibrium==
The affiliative conflict theory becomes complex when one considers that approach and avoidance preferences are not the same, for example; when two people have "differing preferred levels of intimacy" (Burgoon, pg. 31). When two interactants have differing preferred levels of intimacy, they must (consciously or unconsciously) negotiate their differences to arrive at an equilibrium or [[homeostasis]] level that is mutually acceptable. This level of [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]] is known as the intimacy equilibrium point. Equilibrium is reached when individuals or dyads can maintain sufficient [[distance]] and immediacy, such that they are close enough to meet affiliative needs, while allowing each other [[privacy]] and [[autonomy]]. ACT modification to discuss the process of compensation, is utilized to restore equilibrium. [[Anxiety]] is an example of an intimate behavior that can come from a disturbed or unbalanced equilibrium level.&lt;ref name=Burgoon /&gt; Thus, equilibrium can only be established when the two people/dyads are able to negotiate and maintain a comfortable level of intimacy through their nonverbal interactions.

"Because the intimacy equilibrium is said to be a product of several interrelated behaviors, it is not clear as to the influence of such variables on the overall equilibrium level. That is, while a particular factor may affect interpersonal immediacy along one behavioral dimension (e.g., eye contact) this effect may be offset by a compensatory shift in immediacy along some other (unmeasured) behavioral dimension (e.g. body orientation or interpersonal distance). As a consequence, a change may occur in one behavioral dimension, although there would be little relative change in the equilibrium as a whole" (Coutts, pg. 5.)&lt;ref name=Coutts /&gt;

Affiliative Conflict Theory thus proposes that there are two separate, but related; propositions that involve maintaining the balance of the intimacy equilibrium point. The first is the "establishment of an equilibrium or balance of approach and avoidance forces reflected in the intensity of immediacy behaviors emitted by the interactants" (Coutts, pg. 3). The second deals with "compensatory changes in one or more of the immediacy behaviors following disruptions in the established equilibrium" (Coutts, pg. 3). These propositions can also be explained as balanced and unbalanced.&lt;ref name=Coutts /&gt;

===Balanced===
A balanced equilibrium is created when there is an increase in affiliative behavior, notably a decrease in avoidance. All nonverbal behaviors contribute to maintaining balance but researchers focus mostly on three nonverbal behaviors of intimacy and their relationship, which include eye contact, physical proximity and need for affiliation.&lt;ref name=Burgoon /&gt;

[[File:The Gaze.jpg|thumbnail|right|Increased eye contact and physical proximity during social interaction warrants an increase in intimacy.]]

::• '''''[[Eye-contact]]''''': Eye-contact can have a variety of subjective meanings such as friendship, sexual attraction, hate and struggle for dominance.&lt;ref name=Argle&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arygle|first=M.|author2=Dean, J.|title=Eye-Contact, Distance and Affiliation|journal=Sociometry|year=1965|volume=28|issue=3|pages=289–304|doi=10.2307/2786027}}&lt;/ref&gt; During social interaction, people look each other in the eye, repeatedly but short periods. If we may anticipate, people look most while they are listening, and use glances of about 3-10 seconds in length. When applied to the affiliative conflict theory, the approach forces include the need for feedback and affiliative needs. Argyle suggests that increased eye contact during interaction warrants an increase in intimacy. Eye contact is a reinforcer in the operative conditioning of verbal behavior such as looking your partner in the eye when you say I love you or during wedding vows.&lt;ref name=Argle /&gt;

::• '''''Physical Proximity''''' – The interpersonal distance between individuals can also affect the intimacy equilibrium level. During social interaction, one's intimacy should increase when individuals are close in space.&lt;ref name=Russo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Russo|first=N.|title=Eye Contact, Interpersonal Distance, and the Equilibrium Theory.|journal=American Psychological Association|year=1975|volume=31|issue=3|pages=497–502|doi=10.1037/h0076476}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hug or kiss are good examples of nonverbal behaviors that increase intimacy between two interactants. It's important to note that in order to maintain a certain level of intimacy a change in one's behavior, such as interpersonal distance, must be compensated for by a change in another, such as eye contact.&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=B.|author2=Goldberg, G.|author3= Keisler, C.|title=) Visual behavior and face-to-face distance during interaction|journal=Sociometry|year=1969|volume=32|issue=1|pages=43–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
::• '''''[[Need for affiliation]]''''' – The need for affiliation in a balanced equilibrium concerns the desire to be associated with specific people and groups, to have a greater sense of belonging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Connor | first1 = S. | last2 = Rosenblood | first2 = L. | year = 1996 | title = Affiliation motivation in everyday experience: A theoretical comparison | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 70 | issue = 3| pages = 513–522 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.3.513}}&lt;/ref&gt; It plays an important role in human interactions and the formation of bonds and relationships. As a principle of this theory, the need for affiliation is determines the motivation for both verbal and nonverbal behaviors between two individuals. A person with a moderate need of affiliation towards another person tends to want to be intimate with that individual. One of the best examples is a wedding proposal. A man's desire to have a more intimate relationship with a woman is put on display and warrants a verbal response which also validates the woman's need for affiliation if she accepts his proposal.&lt;ref name=Russo /&gt; 
 
It is supposed that similar considerations apply to other types of behavior, which are linked with affiliative motivation. Thus, there have been many studies surrounding the equilibrium point of intimacy of conversation and of amount of smiling. The more these behaviors occur, the more affiliative motivation is satisfied, but if they go too far or are decreased, anxiety is created and an avoidance behavior is shown.&lt;ref name=Burgoon /&gt;

===Unbalanced===

An unbalance is created when there is a decrease in affiliative behavior, notably increased avoidance, changes in one or more of the immediacy behaviors following disruptions in the established equilibrium.  If equilibrium for intimacy is disturbed along one of its dimensions, attempts will first be made to restore it by adjusting the others. If this is not possible because all are held constant, or because the deviation is too extreme, the subject will feel uncomfortable.  If the disturbance is in the direction of less intimacy, he/she will simply feel deprived of affiliative satisfactions. Another source of unbalance is [[communication apprehension]] (CA).&lt;ref name=Meh /&gt; CA constitute a mediating variable and is characterizes as apprehension as an internal feeling of considerable discomfort which leads to communication avoidance. Thus, persons who report high levels of CA experience more anxiety during an interaction than persons who report low levels of CA. Examples of a typical unbalance in response to the close approach of another is to compensate with gaze aversion, indirect body orientation, backing away from a touch, and increased distance.  A person can use avoidance behavior that express a desire to resist what is considered an inappropriate increase in the level of intimacy for that particular interaction.

==Gender roles==

Research shows that gender plays an important role in ACT. As Argyle (1967) points out, females are socialized to have a higher [[affiliative]] orientation, which they may express through using more eye contact.  However, other explanations can account for the higher use of mutual gaze by females.&lt;ref name=Argyle3&gt;{{cite book|last=Argyle|first=M.|title=The psychology of interpersonal behavior,|year=1967|publisher=Penguin Books|location=Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt; A higher affiliative orientation may increase the female's sensitivity and/or responsivity to social cues. Since the eyes are the prime source of information about another's attention, females that socializes in our culture would be expected to look more at the other person's eyes for this social information, thus increasing the amount of time a female dyad engages in eye contact, and perhaps (but not necessarily) increasing the mean length of mutual gaze for the dyad. The data show that the looking time in general shows an increase in the significance of the sex effect with age. Females may rely more on external cues in general, and insofar as the eyes of another are salient cues, the percentage of time in monitoring them should increase.&lt;ref name=Russo /&gt;  
  
Interpersonal distance was examined after a study about eye contact and mean length of mutual glance by Argyle and Ingham (1972) showed conflicting and reversal effects between males and females.&lt;ref name=Argyle4&gt;{{cite journal|last=Argyle|first=M.|author2=Ingham, R.|title=Gaze, mutual gaze, and proximity|journal=Semiotica|pages=32–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Russo conducted a study that focused on the eye-contact and distance relationship. In this study, 24 males and 24 females were drawn in same-sex pairs from kindergarten, third, and sixth grades and asked to "try out some distances and tell (the researcher) how they like them" (p.&amp;nbsp;499). Each participant sat and conversed for 2 minutes at each of the three distances. At each 2 minute interval the researcher asked the subjects how they liked talking at that particular distance. Russo found that the percentage of time engaged in contact (a) increased with distance, (b) was higher for females than males; and (c) did not significantly differ with friendship. In terms of the mean length of eye contact it: (a) did not significantly increase with interpersonal distance; (b) was higher for females than for males; and (c) was significantly greater for friends than nonfriends. Thus, the mean length of eye-contact appears to index affiliative tendencies, while the total amount of eye-contact does not.&lt;ref name=Russo /&gt;

The '''African Institute for Mathematical Sciences''' ('''AIMS''') is a tertiary education and research institute in [[Muizenberg]], South Africa, established in September 2003, and an associated network of linked institutes in Senegal, Ghana, Cameroon, Tanzania and Rwanda.

== History ==

=== Founder ===
The first African Institute for Mathematical Sciences was founded in Cape Town by [[Neil Turok]] in 2003, while he was Chair of Mathematical Physics at [[Cambridge University]]. Neil Turok is the son of [[Ben Turok]], an [[African National Congress|ANC]] MP. In 2008 Turok became Executive Director of the [[Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics]].

AIMS South Africa was formed as a partnership between the following universities: [[Stellenbosch University|University of Stellenbosch]], [[University of Cambridge]], [[University of Cape Town]], [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Paris-Sud]], and [[University of the Western Cape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aims.ac.za/en/about/about-aims|title=About AIMS|publisher=AIMS South Africa|accessdate=8 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908201619/https://www.aims.ac.za/en/about/about-aims|archive-date=8 September 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== AIMS Next Einstein Initiative ===
AIMS was the subject of a talk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/neil_turok_makes_his_ted_prize_wish|title=TED talk about AIMS, by Neil Turok|date=|publisher=TED}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Neil Turok]] after he received the [[TED Prize]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ted.com/ted_prize_2008_1/|title=TED Prize 2008: Dave Eggers and Tutoring, Neil Turok and the next African Einstein, Karen Armstrong and the Charter for Compassion|date=28 February 2008|publisher=TED}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neil Turok's TED wish was that, within his lifetime, an African Einstein would be celebrated.

The AIMS Next Einstein Initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nexteinstein.org|title=AIMS-NextEinstein Initiative|date=21 January 2010|publisher=Nexteinstein.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a plan to create 15 more AIMS centres across Africa. These centres intend to create institutions that are equipped with educational and scientific resources equivalent to the more developed continents, in order to fulfil Neil Turok's TED wish.

The first three centres created after that in South Africa are in Senegal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aims-senegal.sn/|title=AIMS-Senegal|date=4 May 2013|publisher=Aims-senegal.sn|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926215517/http://www.aims-senegal.sn/|archivedate=26 September 2011|deadurl=yes|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghana&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aims.edu.gh//|title=AIMS-Ghana|date=|publisher=AIMS-Ghana|access-date=11 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728045124/http://www.aims.edu.gh/|archive-date=28 July 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cameroon.  AIMS Senegal became operational in September, 2011 in Mbour, near Dakar, and AIMS Ghana opened its doors in 2012 in the small coastal city of Biriwa. An earlier centre based at the African University of Science and Technology (AUST&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aust-abuja.org/|title=African University of Science and Technology|date=|publisher=Aust-abuja.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020170941/http://aust-abuja.org/|archivedate=20 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in Nigeria was known as AIMS Abuja&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/34836|title=Seeking an African Einstein|date=|publisher=Physicsworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tedprize.org/aims-abuja-opens/|title=AIMS Abuja Opens|date=|publisher=Tedprize.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403000731/http://www.tedprize.org/aims-abuja-opens/|archivedate=3 April 2012|deadurl=yes|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a while. AIMS Ghana was set up in 2012, AIMS Cameroon in 2013 and AIMS Tanzania in 2014. There is a sixth centre in Rwanda.

The AIMS Next Einstein Initiative is a continuation of the work of the African Mathematical Institutes Network (AMI-Net).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nepadst.org/platforms/aminet.shtml|title=African Mathematical Institutes Network|date=|publisher=Nepadst.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After AIMS South Africa won the TED Prize in 2008, Neil Turok and his partners developed the AIMS Next Einstein Initiative, the goal of which is to build 15 centres of excellence across Africa by 2023. The Government of Canada made a US$20 million investment in the Next Einstein Initiative in 2010, through its [[International Development Research Centre]], and numerous governments in Africa and Europe have followed suit. In October 2015, a forum took place in Dakar under the auspices of UNESCO’s International Basic Sciences Programme to take the project for a vast network of centres to the next stage.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=Southern Africa.

An '''argument from nonbelief''' is a [[philosophical argument]] that asserts an inconsistency between the [[existence of God]] and a world in which people fail to recognize him.  It is similar to the classic [[problem of evil|argument from evil]] in affirming an inconsistency between the world that exists and the world that would exist if God had certain desires combined with the power to see them through.

There are two key varieties of the argument.  The '''argument from reasonable nonbelief''' (or the '''argument from divine hiddenness''') was first elaborated in [[J. L. Schellenberg]]'s 1993 book ''Divine Hiddenness and Human Reason''.  This argument says that if God existed (and was perfectly good and loving) every reasonable person would have been brought to believe in God; however, there are reasonable nonbelievers; therefore, this God does not exist.

[[Theodore Drange]] subsequently developed '''the argument from nonbelief''', based on the mere existence of nonbelief in God.  Drange considers the distinction between reasonable (by which Schellenberg means inculpable) and unreasonable (culpable) nonbelief to be irrelevant and confusing. Nevertheless, the overwhelming majority of academic discussion is concerned with Schellenberg's formulation.

==Historical references to the problem of divine hiddenness==
The theme of divine hiddenness, silence or darkness has a long history in Judeo-Christian theology.&lt;ref name="hs-ne"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Howard-Snyder | first=Daniel | author2=Paul K. Moser | year=2001 | chapter=Introduction: Divine Hiddenness | chapterurl=http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~howardd/hiddennessintro.html | title=Divine Hiddenness: New Essays | isbn=0-521-00610-4 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=New York}} The introductory section draws heavily on this source for its exposition of material.&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of the Judeo-Christian description of God as hidden are in the Bible, for example in the [[Psalms]], "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?....I cry by day, but you do not answer....",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-lb||Psalms|22:1–2|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Isaiah: "Truly you are a God who hides himself, O God of Israel, the Savior."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-lb||Isaiah|45:15|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first philosophers to write on the theme of divine hiddenness was [[Anselm of Canterbury]], who in his [[Proslogion]] links it to an existential or spiritual concern:
{{quote|I have never seen thee, O Lord my God; I do not know thy form. What, O most high Lord, shall this man do, an exile far from thee? What shall thy servant do, anxious in his love of thee, and cast out afar from thy face? He pants to see thee, and thy face is too far from him. He longs to come to thee, and thy dwelling place is inaccessible. He is eager to find thee, and knows not thy place. He desires to seek thee, and does not know thy face. Lord, thou art my God, and thou art my Lord, yet never have I seen thee. It is thou that hast made me, and hast made me anew, and hast bestowed upon me all the blessings I enjoy; and not yet do I know thee. Finally, I was created to see thee and not yet have I done that for which I was made.&lt;ref name="hs-ne" /&gt;}}

Daniel Howard-Snyder and Paul Moser, in the introduction to a volume of papers on the idea of divine hiddenness as evidence against theism, cite [[Nietzsche]]'s question as anticipating this contemporary theme: "a god who is all-knowing and all-powerful and who does not even make sure his creatures understand his intentions — could that be a god of goodness?"&lt;ref name="hs-ne" /&gt;

==Schellenberg's hiddenness argument==

Discussion of Schellenberg's argument has made explicit a non-theological use of the term 'hiddenness', which is now commonly used simply as a way of talking about the subjective condition of nonbelief in God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schellenberg |first=J. L. |editor1-first=Charles |editor1-last=Taliaferro |editor2-first=Paul |editor2-last=Draper |editor3-first=Philip |editor3-last=Quinn |title=A Companion to Philosophy of Religion 2d ed. |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2010 |pages=509–510 |chapter=Chapter 60: Divine Hiddenness |isbn=978-1-4051-6357-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his first presentation of the argument Schellenberg emphasized inculpable or reasonable nonbelief, but he has since shifted to speaking more specifically about nonresistant nonbelief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Schellenberg | first=J. L. | year=2007 | title=The Wisdom to Doubt: A Justification of Religious Skepticism | publisher=Cornell University Press | isbn=978-0-8014-7851-2 | pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first presentation is often given by commentators as follows, based on Schellenberg's own summing up:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Schellenberg | first=J. L. | year=1993 | title=Divine Hiddenness and Human Reason | publisher=Cornell University Press | isbn=0-8014-2792-4 | pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|
# If there is a God, he is perfectly loving.
# If a perfectly loving God exists, reasonable nonbelief does not occur.
# Reasonable nonbelief occurs.
# No perfectly loving God exists (from 2 and 3).
# Hence, there is no God (from 1 and 4).
}}

Schellenberg has stated that this formulation is misleading, when taken on its own, because it does not make explicit the reason why a perfectly loving God would want to prevent nonbelief. His deepest claim, he says, is "about the connection between love and openness to relationship -- a personal and positively meaningful and explicit sort of relationship of the sort that logically presupposes each party's belief in the other's existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Schellenberg | first=J.

In an article revisiting the argument ten years after it was originally proposed,&lt;ref name="jl2005a"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Schellenberg | first=J. L. | year=2005 | title=The hiddenness argument revisited (I) | journal=[[Religious Studies (journal)|Religious Studies]] | volume=41 | pages=201–215 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | doi=10.1017/S0034412505007614 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schellenberg observes that criticism has mainly centered around the idea that God would prevent inculpable nonbelief. He asserts that there are relatively few criticisms questioning the existence of inculpable nonbelief, and almost no theistic philosopher objects to the idea that God is perfectly loving.

=== God is perfectly loving ===

Schellenberg says he hasn't seen any serious objections to this premise by theistic philosophers, but there certainly are other [[conceptions of God]]. Daniel Howard-Snyder writes about the possibility of believing in an unsurpassably great [[personal god]] that is nevertheless dispassionate towards its creatures. Drawing on the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] concept of [[Eudaimonia]], he says one can think of a god more akin to a wise sage than the loving parent that Schellenberg envisions.&lt;ref name="hs2006"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|last=Howard-Snyder |first=Daniel |year=2006 |title=Hiddenness of God |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=2nd |editor=Donald M.

Theodore Drange, in his attempt to improve the argument ([[#Drange's argument from nonbelief|see below]]), states that there are many theists who do not view God as perfectly loving, and "some Christians think of him as an angry deity bent on punishing people for their sins."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | last=Drange | first=Theodore |authorlink=Theodore Drange | year=1998 | title=Nonbelief as Support for Atheism | booktitle=Twentieth World Congress of Philosophy | url=http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Reli/ReliDran.htm | accessdate=2007-01-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070204050102/http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Reli/ReliDran.htm| archivedate= 4 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drange concludes that the argument should be put forward only in relation to theists who already accept the first premise and believe in a god who is perfectly loving.

Most theists, in fact, do admit that [[love (religious views)|love]] is a central concept in almost all of the world's religions. God is often directly associated with love, especially with [[agape]]. Theologians such as [[Tom Wright (theologian)|N.T. Wright]] suggest that our experience of love is itself a [[argument from love|proof of God's existence]].  However, there are a few others (e.g. Brian Davies in the Thomist tradition) who suggest that the modern interpretation of what it means to say God loves human beings is incorrect, and so that God is able to be loving in a sense while actually willing disbelief.

=== Nonresistant nonbelief, lack of evidence, and sin ===

When asked what he would say when facing God on judgment day, [[Bertrand Russell]] famously replied that he would say "Not enough evidence, God! Not enough evidence!" Some nonbelievers may have hidden from themselves what seems to them to be possible evidence of the divine, but the view of the hiddenness argument is that others have tried hard to believe in God. Schellenberg addresses this difference with his distinction between culpable and ''inculpable'' nonbelief, with the latter defined as "non-belief that exists through no fault of the non-believer."&lt;ref name="jl2005a" /&gt;

Historically, the [[Calvinist]] tradition has placed the blame on nonbelievers. Calvin's religious [[epistemology]] is based on the [[sensus divinitatis]] (Sense of Divinity), the view that the presence of God is universally perceived by all humans. [[Paul Helm]] explains, "Calvin’s use of the term 'sense' signals that the knowledge of God is a common human endowment; mankind is created not only as capable of knowing God, but as actually knowing him."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Helm | first=Paul | author-link=Paul Helm|year=1998 | title=John Calvin, the Sensus Divinitatis, and the noetic effects of sin | journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Religion | volume=43 | issue=2 | pages=87–107 | doi=10.1023/A:1003174629151}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this tradition, there is no inculpable or nonresistant nonbelief. [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], the 18th century American theologian, claimed that while every human being has been granted the capacity to know God, successful use of these capacities requires an attitude of "true benevolence," a willingness to be open to the truth about God. Thus, the failure of non-believers to see "divine things" is in his view due to "a dreadful stupidity of mind, occasioning a sottish insensibility of their truth and importance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Edwards | first=Jonathan | year=1970 | title=Original Sin | authorlink=Jonathan Edwards (theologian) | editor=Clyde A. Holbrook | publisher=Yale University Press | isbn=0-300-01198-9}} As quoted and represented in Howard-Snyder (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demographics of theism and the problem of natural nonbelief ===

In modern times, there are fewer proponents of these views. One reason is that, as Stephen Maitzen argues,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first=Stephen | last=Maitzen | year=2006 | title=Divine Hiddenness and the Demographics of Theism | journal=[[Religious Studies (journal)|Religious Studies]] | volume=42 | pages=177–191 | url=http://philosophy.acadiau.ca/tl_files/sites/philosophy/resources/documents/Maitzen_Hiddenness.pdf | doi=10.1017/S0034412506008274 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[anthropology]] has long established that while religious belief in general is essentially universal, belief in what Calvin would recognize as God is very unevenly distributed among cultures (consider for example [[God in Buddhism]], [[Jain cosmology]], or non-theistic [[animism]]). If God exists, then why, Maitzen asks, does the prevalence of belief in God vary so dramatically with cultural and national boundaries? Jason Marsh has extended this kind of demographic challenge by focusing on human evolution and cognitive science of religion. Why is theistic belief apparently non-existent among early humans but common at later times, at least in some regions?  According to Marsh, the hiddenness problem is harder to answer once we appreciate that much nonbelief is 'natural', owing to the kinds of minds people naturally possess and to their place in evolutionary and cultural history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first=Jason | last=Marsh| year=2013 | title=Darwin and the Problem of Natural Nonbelief | journal=[[The Monist]]| volume=42 | pages=177–191 | url=http://philpapers.org/archive/MARDAT-7.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reason why many philosophers no longer attribute nonbelief to human sinfulness has to do with respect. In fact, modern critics, such as Howard-Snyder, who praised Schellenberg's book for being "religiously sensitive,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Howard-Snyder |first=Daniel |year=1995 |title=Book review: John Schellenberg, ''Divine Hiddenness and Human Reason'' (Cornell 1993) |journal=Mind |volume=104 |issue=414 |pages=430–435 |url=http://www.wwu.edu/~howardd/bookreviews/schellenberg.pdf |accessdate=2007-01-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928070142/http://www.wwu.edu/~howardd/bookreviews/schellenberg.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are similarly sensitive towards the nonbeliever. Howard-Snyder wrote:
{{quote|Even though some nonbelievers lack true benevolence, the empirical evidence strongly suggests that others possess it since they really do earnestly seek the truth about God, love the Good, assess evidence judiciously, and, if anything, display a prejudice for God, not against Him.&lt;ref name="hs2006" /&gt;}}

=== Would a perfectly loving God prevent nonresistant nonbelief? ===

The most serious criticisms of the hiddenness argument have been leveled against the idea that a perfectly loving God would prevent nonresistant nonbelief. Schellenberg argues in two steps, by first claiming that a loving God would enable humans to partake in a relationship with it, and then, assuming that belief in that god is a necessary condition for such relationships to occur, inferring that a loving God would not permit nonbelief. He states:
{{quote|There is, first of all, the claim that if there is a personal God who is perfectly loving, creatures capable of explicit and positively meaningful relationship with God, who have not freely shut themselves off from God, are always in a position to participate in such relationship – able to do so just by trying to.&lt;ref name="jl2005a" /&gt;}}
He justifies this claim by arguing that a conception of divine love can best be formed by extrapolating the best aspects of love in human relations, and draws an analogy with perfect parental love:
{{quote|The perfectly loving parent, for example, from the time the child can first respond to her at all until death separates them, will, insofar as she can help it, see to it that nothing ''she'' does ever puts relationship with herself out of reach for her child.&lt;ref name="jl2005a" /&gt;}}
But, says Schellenberg, belief in God's existence is necessary for engaging in such a meaningful relationship with God. He therefore concludes that if there is a perfectly loving God, such creatures will always believe in it. He further argues that since belief is involuntary, these creatures should always have evidence "causally sufficient" for such belief:
{{quote|The presence of God will be for them like a light that – however much the degree of its brightness may fluctuate – remains on unless they close their eyes.&lt;ref name="jl2005a" /&gt;}}

==Objections and counterarguments==

=== Skeptical theism ===
[[Skeptical theism]] is the view that we should remain skeptical of claims that our perceptions about God's purposes can reasonably be considered good evidence of what they are .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/sceptical-theism/v-1|title=Sceptical theism|last=McBrayer|first=Justin|date=2015|website=The Rutledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|access-date=10 October 2016|quote=Sceptical theists are ... sceptical of our abilities to discern whether the evils in our world constitute good evidence against the existence of God.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/sceptical-theism/v-1|title=Sceptical theism|last=McBrayer|first=Justin|date=2015|website=Rutledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|access-date=10 October 2016|quote=The sceptical element of sceptical theism can be used to undermine various arguments for atheism including both the argument from evil and the argument from divine hiddenness.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central thesis of skeptical theism is that it would not be surprising for an infinitely intelligent and knowledgeable being's reasons for permitting a perception of evil or alleged hiddenness to be beyond human comprehension.&lt;sup&gt;[[Skeptical theism#cite note-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt; That is, what is perceived as hiddeness may be necessary for a greater good or to prevent equal or even greater evils.

==== Noseeum defense ====
The philosophers Michael Bergmann and Michael Rea described the philosopher William Rowe's justification for the second premise of the argument from evil, which is equally applicable to a perception of hiddenness:&lt;blockquote&gt;Some evidential arguments ... rely on a “noseeum” inference of the following sort: NI: If, after thinking hard, we can’t think of any God-justifying reason for permitting some horrific evil then it is likely that there is no such reason. (The reason NI is called a ‘noseeum’ inference is that it says, more or less, that because we don’t see ‘um, they probably ain’t there.)&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=William|year=1979|title=The Problem of Evil and Some Varieties of Atheism, American|journal=American Philosophical Quarterly .|volume=16|pages=335–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2005|title=Michael Bergmann and Michael Rea|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~mrea/papers/In%20Defense%20of%20Skeptical%20Theism.pdf|journal=The Australasian Journal of Philosophy|volume=83|pages=241–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=William|year=1988|title=Evil and Theodicy|journal=Philosophical Topics|volume=16|pages=119–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=William|title=Ruminations about Evil|journal=Philosophical Topics|volume=5|pages=69–88.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Various analogies are offered to show that the noseeum inference is logically unsound. For example, a novice chess player's inability to discern a chess master's choice of moves cannot be used to infer that there is no good reason for the move.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~bergmann/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/OHPT-bergmann-preprint.pdf|title=Oxford Handbook to Philosophical Theology (Skeptical Theism and the Problem of Evil)|last=Bergmann|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=|editor-last=Flint|editor-first=Thomas|editor-link=|location=Oxford|pages=374–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skeptical theist and noseum defense place the burden of proof on the atheist to prove that their intuitions about God are trustworthy.

=== Unreasonable demands on God ===
This argument is sometimes seen as demanding God to prove his existence, for example by performing miracles. Critics have argued that even in Schellenberg's more refined version, the nonbeliever is imposing her own [[epistemological]] expectations on the will of God. A detailed discussion of these kinds of demands, and their moral and spiritual implications, is provided by [[Paul Moser]],&lt;ref name="pm_ne"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Moser | first=Paul | year=2001 | chapter=Cognitive Idolatry and Divine Hiding | chapterurl=http://www.luc.edu/faculty/pmoser/idolanon/CognitiveIdolatry.html | title=Divine Hiddenness: New Essays | isbn=0-521-00610-4 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; who says that such demands amount to cognitive idolatry. He defines [[idolatry]] as "our not letting the true God be Lord in our lives" and instead committing to something other than God by pursuing a quest for self-realization in our own terms. If this is idolatry in our actions, then idolatry in our knowing, he says, is as follows:
{{quote|Cognitive idolatry relies on a standard for knowledge that excludes the primacy of the morally self-transforming knowledge of God central to knowing God as Lord. It rests on an epistemological standard, whether empiricist, rationalist, or some hybrid, that does not let God be Lord. Such idolatry aims to protect one's lifestyle from serious challenge by the God who calls, convicts, and reconciles. It disallows knowledge of God as personal subject and Lord to whom we are morally and cognitively responsible. It allows at most for knowledge of God as an undemanding object of human knowledge.&lt;ref name="pm_ne" /&gt;}}

Schellenberg considers this criticism irrelevant to the argument, which in his opinion, does not impose any demands for demonstrations of God's power, but rather looks for evidence that "need only be such as will be causally sufficient for belief in the absence of resistance... This result might be effected through the much more spiritually appropriate means of religious experience, interpreted in the sensitive manner of a [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] or a [[Kierkegaard]]."&lt;ref name="jl2005a" /&gt; Schellenberg then expresses a certain frustration that theistic writers who otherwise extol the value of religious experiences deny non-theists the right to do so.

=== Soul-making theodicy ===

[[John Hick]] used the term "soul-making" in his theodicy ''Evil and the God of Love'' to describe the kind of spiritual development that he believes justifies the existence of evil. This defense is employed by Michael Murray,&lt;ref name="mm-ne"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Murray | first=Michael J. | year=2001 | chapter=Deus Absconditus | chapterurl=http://server1.fandm.edu/Departments/Philosophy/staticpages/Murray/Hiddenness_Murray.pdf | title=Divine Hiddenness: New Essays | isbn=0-521-00610-4 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; who explains how, in his view, divine hiddenness is essential to soul-making. It may seem that it is not hard to imagine a world where God is known and yet believers act freely with ample opportunities for spiritual development. But Murray gives a deep and careful analysis of the argument, concluding that if God's existence were revealed in such a way as to remove reasonable non-belief, then "any desire that we might have to believe or act in ways contrary to that which has been revealed would be overwhelmed."

Critics note here that, for example, in Christianity (and even more in Judaism, where God is represented as talking to Job and explaining why he is just), God is already believed to have exposed himself very distinctly: for example to the Apostles who saw his resurrection. One theistic explanation of this might be that God knows some people wouldn't believe anyway but if God knows this before creating, there is a problem about God's liability for what is created. More fundamentally in relation to Murray's argument, there is the problem for orthodox believers of explaining the existence of Satan, a fallen angel who is obviously aware of God and yet, according to theistic scriptures, freely chose to rebel against God.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.godonthe.net/evidence/satan.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unknown purpose defense ===

[[Alvin Plantinga]] writes that the statement "We can see no good reason for God to do X" only implies "There is no good reason for God to do X" on the assumption that "If there were a good reason for God to do X, we would be able to see it," which he suggests is absurd.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alvin Plantinga]] ''Warranted Christian Belief'' {{ISBN|0-19-513192-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point might be applied to versions of the argument from nonbelief that suggest without support that there is no good reason for God to permit nonbelief.

=== There really are no atheists defense ===

This is the argument that all true atheists are at heart lying so that they may live in a way that is contrary to God's commands (as seen in particular interpretations of Romans 1:18-25). Critics note that there are atheists who are not lying and are not using their atheism as an escape to sin. Proponents note, however, that they could just as easily still be lying, perhaps not to others anymore but themselves (i.e. loving the wrong woman argument{{clarify|date=October 2015}}). Some have claimed this argument, however, fails to account for Stephen Maitzen's point on the demographics of theism. If all atheists are liars, why are people in some societies so much more likely to lie than in others? &lt;ref&gt;http://philosophy.acadiau.ca/tl_files/sites/philosophy/resources/documents/Maitzen_Hiddenness.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally, some have also claimed this argument fails to account for Jason Marsh's point on natural nonbelief in early humans. Since there was quite plausibly such a thing as natural nonbelief in early humans, then it doesn't make much sense to say that said nonbelief is self-deceptive. That's because natural nonbelief entails nonresistant nonbelief.
&lt;ref&gt;https://philpapers.org/rec/MARDAT-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drange's argument from nonbelief==

Theodore Drange proposed a version of the nonbelief argument in 1996. He considers the distinction between culpable and inculpable nonbelief to be unhelpful in the argument, arguing instead that the mere existence of nonbelief is evidence against the existence of God. A semi-formal presentation of the argument is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last=Drange | first=Theodore | authorlink=Theodore Drange | year=1996 | title=The Arguments From Evil and Nonbelief | url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/aeanb.html | accessdate=2007-01-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070110135633/http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/aeanb.html| archivedate= 10 January 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#If God exists, God:
## wants all humans to believe God exists before they die;
## can bring about a situation in which all humans believe God exists before they die;
## does not want anything that would conflict with and be at least as important as its desire for all humans to believe God exists before they die; and
## always acts in accordance with what it most wants.
# If God exists, all humans would believe so before they die (from 1).
# But not all humans believe God exists before they die.
# Therefore, God does not exist (from 2 and 3).

Drange's argument is directed primarily to Christians, and the philosopher Laura Garcia has replied from that perspective. She says that Drange's argument hinges on the idea that belief in God's existence is, according to Christians, necessary for salvation. According to Garcia this idea is mistaken: "many Christians deny this claim and the Catholic Church explicitly rejects it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Garcia |first=Laura |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-last=Howard-Snyder |editor2-first=Paul |editor2-last=Moser |title=Divine Hiddenness: New Essays |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |page=84 |chapter=St. John of the Cross and the Necessity of Divine Hiddenness |isbn=0-521-00610-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as Garcia notes, Drange has answered that for many Christians—in particular, evangelical Christians—his point should remain convincing, and that there are in any case other good things that belief in God can bring for humans, which a good God would desire, such as peace of mind and a sense of meaning in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Garcia |first=Laura |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-last=Howard-Snyder |editor2-first=Paul |editor2-last=Moser |title=Divine Hiddenness: New Essays |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |page=85 |chapter=St. John of the Cross and the Necessity of Divine Hiddenness |isbn=0-521-00610-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29914">Formerly known as the '''World Life Issues on Environment and Development''' (WCED), the mission of the '''Brundtland Commission''' is to unite countries to pursue [[sustainable development]] together. The Chairperson of the Commission, [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], was appointed by [[United Nations]] [[UNSG|Secretary-General]] [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]] in December 1983. At the time, the [[UN General Assembly]] realized that there was a heavy deterioration of the human environment and natural resources. To rally countries to work and pursue sustainable development together, the UN decided to establish the '''Brundtland Commission'''. Gro Harlem Brundtland was the former [[Prime Minister of Norway]] and was chosen due to her strong background in the sciences and [[public health]]. The Brundtland Commission officially dissolved in December 1987 after releasing ''[[Our Common Future]]'', also known as the ''[[Our Common Future|Brundtland Report]]'', in October 1987. The document popularized (and defined) the term 
"[[Sustainable Development]]". ''[[Our Common Future]]'' won the [[University of Louisville]] [[Grawemeyer Award]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=grawemeyer.org&gt;{{cite web|title=1991- The United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development|url=http://grawemeyer.org/worldorder/previous-winners/1991-the-united-nations-world-commission-on-environment-and-development.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103112536/http://grawemeyer.org/worldorder/previous-winners/1991-the-united-nations-world-commission-on-environment-and-development.html|archivedate=2013-11-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization Center for Our Common Future was started in April 1988 to take the place of the Commission.

==History==
Ten years after the 1972 [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]], a number of global environmental challenges had clearly not been adequately addressed.  In several ways, these challenges had grown. Particularly, the underlying problem of how to reduce poverty in low-income countries through more productive and industrialized economy without, in the process, exacerbating the global and local environmental burdens, remained unresolved. Neither high-income countries in the North nor low-income countries in the South were willing to give up an economic development based on growth, but environmental threats, ranging from pollution, acid rain, deforestation and desertification, the destruction of the ozone layer, to early signs of climate change, were impossible to overlook and increasingly unacceptable. There was a tangible need for a developmental concept that would allow reconciling economic development with [[environmental protection]]. Views differed on several questions: were local environmental problems the result of local developments or of a global economic system that forced particularly low-income countries to destroy their environmental basis? Did environmental burdens result mainly from destructive economic growth-based development or from a lack of economic development and modernization? Would reconciling the economy and the environment require mainly technical means by using more resource-efficient technologies or mainly social and structural changes that would include political decision-making as well as changes in private consumption patterns?
The 1980 World Conservation Strategy of the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]], was the first report that included a very brief chapter on a concept called "sustainable development". It focused on global structural changes and was not widely read. The UN initiated an independent commission, which was asked to provide an analysis of existing problems and ideas for their solution, similar to earlier commissions such as the Independent Commission on International Development Issues (Brandt Commission) and the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues (Palme Commission).&lt;ref&gt;Iris Borowy, Defining Sustainable Development: the World Commission on Environment and Development (Brundtland Commission), Milton Park: earthscan/Routledge, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1983, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]], asked the Prime Minister of Norway, [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], to create an organization independent of the UN to focus on environmental and developmental problems and solutions after an affirmation by the General Assembly resolution in the fall of 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/r10/oi.nsf/8bb15fe43a5fb81788256b58005ff079/398761d6c3c7184988256fc40078499b!OpenDocument|title=History of Sustainability&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=epa.gov|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502230314/http://yosemite.epa.gov/r10/oi.nsf/8bb15fe43a5fb81788256b58005ff079/398761d6c3c7184988256fc40078499b!OpenDocument|archivedate=2 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new organization was the Brundtland Commission, or more formally, the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED). The Brundtland Commission was first headed by [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] as Chairman and [[Mansour Khalid]] as Vice-Chairman.

The organization aimed to create a united international community with shared sustainability goals by identifying sustainability problems worldwide, raising awareness about them, and suggesting the implementation of solutions. In 1987, the Brundtland Commission published the first volume of “[[Our Common Future]],” the organization’s main report. “[[Our Common Future]]” strongly influenced the [[Earth Summit]] in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992 and the third UN Conference on Environment and Development in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2002. Also, it is credited with crafting the most prevalent definition of sustainability, as seen below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonfuture.oregonstate.edu/part1/pf1_03.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623004236/http://oregonfuture.oregonstate.edu/part1/pf1_03.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 June 2010|title=This Norwegian's past may connect with your future|date=23 June 2010|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events before Brundtland===

During the 1980s it had been revealed that the [[World Bank]] had started to experience an expanded role in intervening with the economic and social policies of the [[Third World]]. This was most notable through the events at [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Bretton Woods]] in 1945. The ideas of [[neoliberalism]] and the institutions promoting [[economic globalization]] dominated the political agenda of the world's then leading trading nations: the United States under President [[Ronald Reagan]] and the United Kingdom under Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], both classical liberals.

These events led into an era of [[free market]]s built on a distortion of the international order forged in 1945 at Bretton Woods. Bretton Woods was transformed through the 1980s and 1990s, finally ending in 1995 with the establishment of the [[World Trade Organization]] ushered in by United States President [[Bill Clinton]]. Bretton Woods was formed as an arrangement among the industrialized nation states, but was transformed into a global regime of ostensibly free markets that privileged [[multinational corporations]] and actually undermined the [[sovereignty]] of the very national communities that established Bretton Woods.

The Brundtland Report was intended as a response to the conflict between the nascent order promoting globalized economic growth and the accelerating ecological degradation occurring on a global scale. The challenge posed in the 1980s was to harmonize prosperity with ecology. This postulated finding the means to continue economic growth without undue harm to the environment. To address the urgent needs of developing countries (Third World), the United Nations saw a need to strike a better balance of human and environmental well-being. This was to be achieved by redefining the concepts of "economic development" as the new idea of "sustainable development" - as it was called in the Brundtland Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldsustainability.pbworks.com/w/page/15443575/PreludeToBrundtland|title=ProfWork / PreludeToBrundtland|work=pbworks.com|accessdate=18 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118221135/http://worldsustainability.pbworks.com/w/page/15443575/PreludeToBrundtland|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand this paradigm shift, we start with the meaning of the key term: development

===Resolution establishing the Commission===

The 1983 [[UN General Assembly|General Assembly]] passed Resolution 38/161 "Process of preparation of the Environmental Perspective to the Year 2000 and Beyond", establishing the Commission.&lt;ref name="estabRes"/&gt; In A/RES/38/161, the General Assembly:

:"8. Suggests that the Special Commission, when established, should focus mainly on the following terms of reference for its work:

::(a) To propose long-term environmental strategies for achieving sustainable development to the year 2000 and beyond;

::(b) To recommend ways in which concern for the environment may be translated into greater co-operation among developing countries and between countries at different stages of economic and social development and lead to the achievement of common and mutually supportive objectives which take account of the interrelationships between people, resources, environment and development;

::(c) To consider ways and means by which the international community can deal more effectively with environmental concerns, in the light of the other recommendations in its report;

::(d) To help to define shared perceptions of long-term environmental issues and of the appropriate efforts needed to deal successfully with the problems of protecting and enhancing the environment, a long-term agenda for action during the coming decades, and aspirational goals for the world community, taking into account the relevant resolutions of the session of a special character of the Governing Council in 1982;"&lt;ref name="estabRes"&gt;United Nations. 1983.

==Modern definition of sustainable development==
{{Main|Sustainable development}}
The Brundtland Commission draws upon several notions in its definition of [[sustainable development]], which is the most frequently cited definition of the concept to date.

A key element in the definition is the unity of environment and development. The Brundtland Commission argues against the assertions of the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment and provides an alternative perspective on sustainable development, unique from that of the 1980 World Conservation Strategy of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The Brundtland Commission pushed for the idea that while the "environment" was previously perceived as a sphere separate from human emotion or action, and while "development" was a term habitually used to describe political goals or economic progress, it is more comprehensive to understand the two terms in relation to each other (We can better understand the environment in relation to development and we can better understand development in relation to the environment, because they cannot and should not be distinguished as separate entities). Brundtland argues:

"...the "environment" is where we live; and "development" is what we all do in attempting to improve our lot within that abode. The two are inseparable."

The Brundtland Commission insists upon the environment being something beyond physicality, going beyond that traditional school of thought to include social and political atmospheres and circumstances. It also insists that development is not just about how poor countries can ameliorate their situation, but what the entire world, including developed countries, can do to ameliorate our common situation.

The term sustainable development was coined in the paper ''Our Common Future'', released by the Brundtland Commission.
Sustainable development is the kind of development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The two key concepts of sustainable development are:
• the concept of "needs" in particular the essential needs of the world's poorest people, to which they should be given overriding priority; and
• the idea of limitations which is imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet both present and future needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Editorials/Kates-apr05-full.html|title=Environment Magazine - What Is Sustainable Development? Goals, Indicators, Values, and Practice|first=Environment Magazine - Taylor and|last=Francis|work=environmentmagazine.org|accessdate=18 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118214557/http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Editorials/Kates-apr05-full.html|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most agree that the central idea of the Brundtland Commission's definition of "sustainable development" is that of intergenerational equity. In sum, the "needs" are basic and essential, economic growth will facilitate their fulfillment, and equity is encouraged by citizen participation. Therefore, another characteristic that really sets this definition apart from others is the element of humanity that the Brundtland Commission integrates.

The particular ambiguity and openness-to-interpretation of this definition has allowed for widespread support from diverse efforts, groups and organizations. However, this has also been a criticism; perceived by some notable commentators as "self-defeating and compromised rhetoric".&lt;ref&gt;Manns, .J., "Beyond Brudtland's Compromise", Town &amp; Country Planning, August 2010, pp.337-340 {{cite web |url=http://www.tcpa.org.uk/resources.php?action=resource&amp;id=900 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416182659/http://www.tcpa.org.uk/resources.php?action=resource&amp;id=900 |archivedate=2015-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It nonetheless lays out a core set of guiding principles that can be enriched by an evolving global discourse. As a result of the work of the Brundtland Commission, the issue of sustainable development is on the agenda of numerous international and national institutions, as well as corporations and city efforts. The definition gave light to new perspectives on the sustainability of an ever-changing planet with an ever-changing population.

-Brundtland commission
(Our Common Future)
The Report of the Brundtland Commission, Our Common Future, was published by Oxford University Press in 1987, and was welcomed by the General Assembly Resolution 42/187. Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, General Assembly Resolution 42/187, 11 December 1987. One version with links to cited documents Our Common Future, Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987. Published as Annex to General Assembly document A/42/427, Development and International Co-operation is available.

The document was the culmination of a “900-day” international-exercise which catalogued, analysed, and synthesised written submissions and expert testimony from “senior government representatives, scientists and experts, research institutes, industrialists, representatives of non-governmental organizations, and the general public” held at public hearings throughout the world.

The Brundtland Commission's mandate was to: “[1] re-examine the critical issues of environment and development and to formulate innovative, concrete, and realistic action proposals to deal with them; [2] strengthen international cooperation on environment and development and assess and propose new forms of cooperation that can break out of existing patterns and influence policies and events in the direction of needed change; and [3] raise the level of understanding and commitment to action on the part of individuals, voluntary organizations, businesses, institutes, and governments” (1987: 347). “The Commission focused its attention on the areas of population, food security, the loss of species and genetic resources, energy, industry, and human settlements - realizing that all of these are connected and cannot be treated in isolation one from another” (1987: 27).

The Brundtland Commission Report recognised that human resource development in the form of poverty reduction, gender equity, and wealth redistribution was crucial to formulating strategies for environmental conservation, and it also recognised that environmental-limits to economic growth in industrialised and industrialising societies existed. As such, the Report offered “the analysis, the broad remedies, and the recommendations for a sustainable course of development” within such societies (1987:16). However, the Report was unable to identify the mode(s) of production that are responsible for degradation of the environment, and in the absence of analysing the principles governing market-led economic growth, the Report postulated that such growth could be reformed and expanded; this lack of analysis resulted in an obfuscated-introduction of the term sustainable development.

The report deals with sustainable development and the change of politics needed for achieving it. The definition of this term in the report is quite well known and often cited:

:"Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs". It contains two key concepts:
:*the concept of "needs", in particular the essential needs of the world's poor, to which overriding priority should be given; and
:*the idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet present and future needs."

==Structure==
The Brundtland Commission was chaired by former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland. Politicians, civil servants, and environmental experts make up the majority of the members. Members of the commission represent 21 different nations (both developed and developing countries are included). Many of the members are important political figures in their home country. One example is [[William Ruckelshaus]], former head of the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]. All members of the commission were appointed by both Gro Harlem Brundtland and [[Mansour Khalid]], the Chairman and Vice Chairman.

The commission focuses on setting up networks to promote environmental stewardship. Most of these networks make connections between governments and non-government entities. One such network is Bill Clinton's Council on Sustainable Development. In this council government and business leaders come together to share ideas on how to encourage sustainable development. The Brundtland Commission has been the most successful in forming international ties between governments and multinational corporations. The 1992 and 2002 [[Earth Summit]]s were the direct result of the Brundtland Commission. The international structure and scope of the Brundtland Commission allow multiple problems (such as [[deforestation]] and [[ozone depletion]]) to be looked at from a holistic approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/csd/csd15/media/backgrounder_brundtland.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=17 April 2012|website=archive.org|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417131934/http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/csd/csd15/media/backgrounder_brundtland.pdf|archivedate=17 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainability efforts==
The three main pillars of sustainable development include economic growth, environmental protection, and social equality. While many people agree that each of these three ideas contribute to the overall idea of sustainability, it is difficult to find evidence of equal levels of initiatives for the three pillars in countries' policies worldwide. With the overwhelming number of countries that put economic growth on the forefront of sustainable development, it is evident that the other two pillars have been suffering, especially with the overall well being of the environment in a dangerously unhealthy state. The Brundtland Commission has put forth a conceptual framework that many nations agree with and want to try to make a difference with in their countries, but it has been difficult to change these concepts about sustainability into concrete actions and programs. Implementing sustainable development globally is still a challenge, but because of the Brundtland Commission's efforts, progress has been made. After releasing their report, ''Our Common Future'', the Brundtland Commission called for an international meeting to take place where more concrete initiatives and goals could be mapped out. This meeting was held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil. A comprehensive plan of action, known as [[Agenda&amp;nbsp;21]], came out of the meeting. Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 entailed actions to be taken globally, nationally, and locally in order to make life on Earth more sustainable going into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/index.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405221844/http://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/index.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 April 2012|title=DSD :: Resources - Publications - Core Publications|date=5 April 2012|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic Growth===
Economic Growth is the pillar that most groups focus on when attempting to attain more sustainable efforts and development. In trying to build their economies, many countries focus their efforts on resource extraction, which leads to unsustainable efforts for environmental protection as well as economic growth sustainability. While the Commission was able to help to change the association between economic growth and resource extraction, the total worldwide consumption of resources is projected to increase in the future. So much of the natural world has already been converted into human use that the focus cannot simply remain on economic growth and omit the ever-growing problem of environmental sustainability. Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 reinforces the importance of finding ways to generate economic growth without hurting the environment. Through various trade negotiations such as improving access to markets for exports of developing countries, Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 looks to increase economic growth sustainability in countries that need it most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/res_agenda21_02.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408182141/http://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/res_agenda21_02.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 April 2012|title=DSD :: Resources - Publications - Core Publications|date=8 April 2012|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental Protection===
Environmental Protection has become more important to government and businesses over the last 20&amp;nbsp;years, leading to great improvements in the number of people willing to invest in green technologies. For the second year in a row in 2010, the United States and Europe added more power capacity from renewable sources such as wind and solar. In 2011 the efforts continue with 45 new wind energy projects beginning in 25 different states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awea.org/learnabout/publications/reports/upload/3Q-2011-AWEA-Market-Report-for-Public.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118220031/http://www.awea.org/learnabout/publications/reports/upload/3Q-2011-AWEA-Market-Report-for-Public.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on environmental protection has transpired globally as well, including a great deal of investment in renewable energy power capacity. Eco-city development occurring around the world helps to develop and implement water conservation, smart grids with renewable energy sources, LED street lights and energy efficient building. The consumption gap remains, consisting of the fact that "roughly 80 percent of the natural resources used each year are consumed by about 20 percent of the world's population". This level is striking and still needs to be addressed now and throughout the future.&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/climatechange/shared/gsp/docs/GSP1-6_Background%20on%20Sustainable%20Devt.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321094820/http://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/climatechange/shared/gsp/docs/GSP1-6_Background%20on%20Sustainable%20Devt.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social Equality===
The Social Equality and Equity as pillars of sustainable development focus on the social well-being of people. The growing gap between incomes of rich and poor is evident throughout the world with the incomes of the richer households increasing relative to the incomes of middle - or lower-class households.This is attributed partly to the land distribution patterns in rural areas where majority live from land. Global inequality has been declining, but the world is still extremely unequal, with the richest 1% of the world’s population owning 40% of the world’s wealth and the poorest 50% owning around 1%. The Brundtland Commission made a significant impact trying to link environment and development and thus, go away from the idea of environmental protection whereby some scholars saw environment as something of its sake. The Commission has thus reduced the number of people living on less than a dollar a day to just half of what it used to be, as many can approach the environment and use it.These achievements can also be attributed to economic growth in [[China]] and [[India]].&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;

The '''Byzantine Fresco Chapel''' is a part of the [[Menil Collection]] in [[Houston, Texas]], near the [[University of St. Thomas (Texas)|University of St. Thomas]]. From February 1997 to February 2012, it displayed the only intact [[Byzantine]] [[frescoes]] of this size and importance in the entire western hemisphere. The Byzantine frescoes had been taken from the church of [[Church of Saint Evphemianos, Lysi|St. Evphemianos]] in [[Lysi]], [[Cyprus]] in the 1980s. In September 2011, the collection announced that the frescos would be permanently returned to Cyprus in February 2012, following the conclusion of a long-term loan agreement with the [[Church of Cyprus|Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903703604576587072924927678 "From Texas at Age 700"].

They will not return to their original home as Lysi is now in [[Northern Cyprus]], but will be displayed at the Byzantine Museum in [[Nicosia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://houston.culturemap.com/newsdetail/09-23-11-20-43-menil-returning-byzantine-frescoes-to-cypress/ "See them while you can: Menil returning Byzantine frescoes to Cyprus in February 2012"].

Retrieved September 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On March 4, 2012, the Byzantine Fresco Chapel closed, but re-opened in 2015 for the first in a series of site-specific projects.

==History==
The chapel was opened in February 1997, and displayed masterworks from the 13th century—a dome with [[Christ Pantocrator]] and an [[apse]] depicting the [[Virgin Mary]] the [[Panayia]]. The frescoes had been stolen from a chapel near Lysi in the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish-occupied]] section of [[Cyprus]] in the 1980s, cut into 38 pieces, and shipped to Germany by thieves to sell them in the arts black-market.&lt;ref name="Slessor, Christine 1998"&gt;Slessor, Christine. "Out of this world&amp;nbsp;– Chapel Museum, Houston, Texas&amp;nbsp;– Glass and Transparency." ''The Architectural Review''. May, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The 38 fresco fragments were bought from the thieves by the Houston-based Menil Foundation on behalf of the Church of Cyprus, the rightful owner of the frescoes. The Menil Foundation then funded a careful restoration of the paintings.&lt;ref name="Menil Collection website"&gt;[https://www.menil.org/exhibitions/226-byzantine-fresco-chapel Byzantine Fresco Chapel]. ''www.menil.org''.&lt;/ref&gt; These intact frescoes were unique in the western hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Menil Collection website" /&gt;

==The original collection==
[[File:Lysi-dome.jpg|thumb|left|Dome from church in Lysi, Cyprus depicting Christ the Pantokrator]]
The major part of the collection consisted of the frescoes of the dome and apse. According to the guide to the museum, "the Lysi dome represents Christ Pantokrator, 'All sovereign'. It defines a space with no beginning and no end."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Guide to the Byzantine Fresco Chapel Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction of Christ gazing directly forward "has driven time out of space. His gaze is transworldly: not looking but all-seeing."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; By not depicting the Lord below the bust, he is "universal and ubiquitous."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Surrounding the figure of Christ is a double row of angels moving towards the throne prepared by God the Father for the [[Second Coming of Christ]]. The throne is guarded by the [[Archangel Michael]] and [[Archangel Gabriel]] and two [[seraphim]]. The [[Virgin Mary]] leads one line of angels to the throne, while [[John the Baptist]] leads the other.

In the apse, the Virgin was depicted as flanked by the two archangels with a medallion on her breast of the infant Christ, symbolizing the [[Incarnation]] of Christ.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:ByzantineChapelMuseum.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Church within a Museum; the glass and wood chapel that housed the only intact Byzantine frescoes in the Western hemisphere]]
The {{convert|4000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} $4 million building was designed by architect [[François de Menil]]. The interior combines rough stone, opaque glass, and rich woods, to create a space that is both art museum and spiritual space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houstonmuseumdistrict.org/default/museumpages/museumpage.asp?MID=15 "Byzantine Fresco Chapel"]. ''Houston Museum District''. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208080959/http://www.houstonmuseumdistrict.org/default/museumpages/museumpage.asp?MID=15 |date=February 8, 2012}}. Retrieved January 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The suspended-glass "walls" are not replicas of the chapel that the frescoes were removed from, but created a new context for displaying the icons. In order not to simply replicate the original chapel, de Menil designed "a mediating external building with an embedded steel structure&amp;nbsp;– a 'reliquary box'&amp;nbsp;– which forms a neutral enclosure for a freestanding chapel," according to Christine Slessor in ''The Architectural Review''.&lt;ref name="Slessor, Christine 1998" /&gt;

{{quote|"The Byzantine Chapel Museum is a religious building whose purpose is to restore spiritual significance and function to two thirteenth-century Byzantine Frescoes, a dome and an apse, rescued and restored by the owner ... The materiality of the original chapel is shattered and made ephemeral through the fragmented, freestanding sandblasted laminated glass structure which is an abstracted evocation of the original chapel. The infinite is evoked through the play of darkness and light." François de Menil, May 1997&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dupont.com/safetyglass/lgn/stories/0802.html "Byzantine Fresco Chapel Museum uses sandblasted laminated glass to restore spiritual significance"]. ''Laminated Glass News'', E.I. Dupont de Nemours Company. August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Byzantine chapel is oriented to face the cardinal directions&amp;nbsp;– the facades face directly north, south, east and west. The enclosed space measures approximately {{convert|116000|cuft|m3}}. There are no windows on the surface area of the building, except for a skylight of {{convert|1012|sqft|m2}} of clear, double glazed glass, which permits natural light to pervade the interior.&lt;ref&gt;Allan V.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
{{See also|Anno Domini}}
The year numbering system used with Common Era notation was devised by the Christian monk [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in the year 525 to replace the [[Era of Martyrs]] system, because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.&lt;ref name=Pedersen /&gt; He attempted to number years from an initial reference date ("[[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]"), an event he referred to as the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Pedersen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doggett, L.E., (1992), [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/calendars.html "Calendars"] in Seidelmann, P.K., ''The Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac'', Sausalito CA: University Science Books, 2.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BW_1mt4oebQC&amp;pg=PA686&amp;dq=jesus+birth+year+before |title=The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia |first=Geoffrey W. |last=Bromiley |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing |year=1995 |isbn= 978-0-8028-3781-3 |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dionysius labeled the column of the table in which he introduced the new era as "''Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi''".&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, O., (1983), "The Ecclesiastical Calendar and the Life of the Church" in Coyne, G.V. et al.

Numbering years in this manner became more widespread in Europe with its usage by [[Bede]] in England in 731. Bede also introduced the practice of dating years before what he supposed was the year of birth of Jesus,&lt;ref&gt;Bede wrote of the Incarnation of Jesus, but treated it as synonymous with birth. Blackburn, B &amp; Holford-Strevens, L, (2003), ''The Oxford Companion to the Year'', Oxford University Press, 778.&lt;/ref&gt; and the practice of not using a year zero.{{efn|As noted in [[History of zero|History of the zero]], the use of zero in Western civilization was uncommon before the twelfth century.}} In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last [[Western Europe]]an country to [[Spanish era|switch to the system]] begun by Dionysius.&lt;ref name="CathEncy-Chron" /&gt;

=== Vulgar Era ===
[[File:Johannes Kepler 1610.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Johannes Kepler]] first used "Vulgar Era" to distinguish dates on the Christian calendar from the [[regnal year]] typically used in national law.]]
The term "Common Era" is traced back in English to its appearance as "[[wikt:Vulgar|Vulgar]] Era" to distinguish dates on the Ecclesiastic calendar in popular use from dates of the [[regnal year]], the year of reign of a sovereign, typically used in national law.

The first use of the Latin term ''vulgaris aerae''{{Efn|name=VulgarisAerae0|In Latin, ''Common Era'' is written as ''Vulgaris Aerae''. It also occasionally appears as ''æræ vulgaris'', ''aerae vulgaris'', ''aeram vulgarem'', ''anni vulgaris'', ''vulgaris aerae Christianae'', and ''anni vulgatae nostrae aerae Christianas''.}} discovered so far was in a 1615 book by [[Johannes Kepler]].&lt;ref name=VulgarisAerae1 /&gt; Kepler uses it again in a 1616 table of [[Ephemeris|ephemerides]],&lt;ref name=VulgarisAerae2&gt;{{cite book |title=Second use of "vulgaris aerae" (Latin for Common Era) (1616) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0kElSQAACAAJ&amp;dq=vulgaris+aerae|publisher=Plancus |author=Kepler, Johann |year=1616 |accessdate=2011-05-18}} {{cite book |title=Ephemerides novae motuum caelestium, ab Ānno vulgaris aerae MDCXVII en observationibus potissimum Tychonis Brahei hypothesibus physicis, et tabulis Rudolphinis... |first=Johann |last=Kepler |publisher=Plancus |year=1616 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1617.&lt;ref name=VulgarisAerae3&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5w47twAACAAJ&amp;dq=vulgaris+aerae|title=Third use of "vulgaris aerae" (Latin for Common Era) (1617) |publisher=sumptibus authoris, excudebat Iohannes Plancus |author1=Kepler, Johannes |author2=Fabricus, David |year=1617 |accessdate=2011-05-18}} {{cite book |title=Ephemerides novae motuum coelestium, ab anno vulgaris aerae MDCXVII[-XXXVI]... |quote=Part 3 has title: Tomi L Ephemeridvm Ioannis Kepleri pars tertia, complexa annos à M.DC.XXIX. in M.DC.XXXVI.

Although Jews have their own [[Hebrew calendar]], they often use the [[Gregorian calendar]], without the AD prefix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote=Jews do not generally use the words "A.D." and "B.C." to refer to the years on the Gregorian calendar. "A.D." means "the year of our [[L-rd]]," and we do not believe Jesus is the L-rd. Instead, we use the abbreviations C.E. (Common or Christian Era) and B.C.E. (Before the Common Era). |author=Tracey R Rich |url=http://www.jewfaq.org/calendar.htm#Years | title=Judaism 101 | accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1825, the abbreviation VE (for Vulgar Era) was in use among Jews to denote years in the Western calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishgen.org/jcr-uk/susser/plymouthinscriptions.htm |title=Plymouth, England Tombstone inscriptions |publisher=Jewish Communities &amp; Records |quote=Here is buried his honour Judah ben his honour Joseph, a prince and honoured amongst philanthropists, who executed good deeds, died in his house in the City of Bath, Tuesday, and was buried here on Sunday, 19 Sivan in the year 5585.

In general publications, in the 200 years between 1808 and 2008 the ratio of usage of BCE to BC has increased by about 20% and CE to AD by about 50%, primarily since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=BCE,BC,CE,AD&amp;year_start=1808&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=10&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1;,BCE;,c0;.t1;,BC;,c0;.t1;,CE;,c0;.t1;,AD;,c0|title=Google Ngram Viewer|website=books.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary usage ==
Some academics in the fields of [[theology]], [[education]] and [[history]] have adopted CE and BCE notation, although there is some disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the Society for Historical Archaeology states in its more recent style guide "Do not use C.E. (common era), B.P. (before present), or B.C.E.; convert these expressions to A.D. and B.C." (In section I 5 the Society explains how to use "years B.P." in connection with [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon ages]].) {{cite web |url=https://sha.org/documents/SHAStyleGuide-Dec2011.pdf |title=Style Guide |author=Society for Historical Archaeology |date=December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419052334/http://www.sha.org/documents/SHAStyleGuide-Dec2011.pdf |archivedate=2016-04-19 |accessdate=2017-01-16 |deadurl=no |df=}} whereas the [[American Anthropological Association]] style guide takes a different approach calling for "C.E." and "B.C.E." {{cite web |url=http://www.aaanet.org/publications/guidelines.cfm |title=AAA Style Guide |format=PDF |author=American Anthropological Society
|date=2009 |accessdate=2015-05-26 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More visible uses of Common Era notation have recently surfaced at major museums in the English-speaking world. Furthermore, several style guides now prefer or mandate its usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.egyptstudy.org/ostracon/guidelines.html |journal=The Ostracon – Journal of the Egyptian Studies Society |title=Submission Guidelines for ''The Ostracon'' |quote=For dates, please use the now-standard "BCE–CE" notation, rather than "BC–AD."

Even some style guides for Christian churches prefer its use: for example, the Episcopal Diocese ''Maryland Church News''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ang-md.org/mcn/style_guide.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620230309/http://ang-md.org/mcn/style_guide.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 June 2006 |title=Maryland Church News Submission Guide &amp; Style Manual |work=Maryland Church News |format=PDF |date=1 April 2005 |accessdate=2011-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the usage of the BCE/CE notation in [[textbook]]s is growing.&lt;ref name=Gormley /&gt; Some publications have moved over to using it exclusively. For example, the 2007 World Almanac was the first edition to switch over to the BCE/CE usage, ending a 138-year usage of the traditional BC/AD dating notation. It is used by the [[College Board]] in its history tests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/history_world/topic.html?worldhist |title=AP: World History |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Norton Anthology of English Literature]]. Others have taken a different approach. The US-based [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] uses BCE/CE notation in articles on non-Christian religious topics such as [[Religious significance of Jerusalem#Jerusalem, Jews and Judaism|Jerusalem and Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |title=Jerusalem Timeline |publisher=History Channel |accessdate=2011-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520111303/http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |archivedate=May 20, 2011 }};{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |title=Jerusalem: Biographies |publisher=History Channel |accessdate=2011-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520111303/http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |archivedate=2011-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[England and Wales]] introduced the BCE/CE notation system into the official school curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-531644-ad-and-bc-become-cebce.do |title=AD and BC become CE/BCE |date=9 February 2002 |accessdate=2012-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220120909/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-531644-ad-and-bc-become-cebce.do |archivedate=December 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, in the United States, the Kentucky State School Board reversed its decision to use BCE and CE in the state's new Program of Studies, leaving education of students about these concepts a matter of discretion at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tffky.org/articles/Press%20Releases/prs%2006-14-06%20MC.html |title=State School Board reverses itself on B.C./A.D. controversy |publisher=Family Foundation of Kentucky |accessdate=2011-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427032052/http://www.tffky.org/articles/Press%20Releases/prs%2006-14-06%20MC.html |archivedate=April 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legacy.kctcs.edu/todaysnews/index.cfm?tn_date=2006-06-16#5119 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710123618/http://legacy.kctcs.edu/todaysnews/index.cfm?tn_date=2006-06-16#5119 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 July 2009 |title=School board keeps traditional historic designations |author=Joe Biesk |publisher=Louisville Courier-Journal |date=15 June 2006 |accessdate=2011-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpe.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/5F08162C-899F-47FE-9367-1DDD82DE74E6/0/6_CommissionerofEdReport.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926165947/http://cpe.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/5F08162C-899F-47FE-9367-1DDD82DE74E6/0/6_CommissionerofEdReport.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 September 2006|title=Kentucky Board of Education Report |publisher=Kentucky Board of Education Report |date=10 June 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2011, media reports suggested that the BC/AD notation in Australian school textbooks would be replaced by BCE/CE notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2033225/Australia-goes-PC-ban-BC-Birth-Jesus-removed-reference-point-dates-school-history-books.html |title=Australia goes all PC with a ban on BC: Birth of Jesus to be removed as reference point for dates in school history books |date=2 September 2011|accessdate=2012-02-05 |location=London |work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story became national news and drew opposition from some politicians and church leaders. Weeks after the story broke, the [[Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority]] denied the rumour and stated that the BC/AD notation would remain, with CE and BCE as an optional suggested learning activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/adbc-rock-solid-in-curriculum-20111020-1mab2.html |title=AD/BC rock solid in curriculum |date=21 October 2011|accessdate=2012-03-04 |location=Melbourne |work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rationale ==

=== Support ===
The use of CE in Jewish scholarship was historically motivated by the desire to avoid the implicit "Our Lord" in the abbreviation ''AD''.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Although other aspects of dating systems are based in Christian origins, AD is a direct reference to Jesus as Lord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American and English Encyclopedia of Law and Practice|year=1910|page=1116|quote=It has been said of the Latin words anno Domini, meaning in the year of our Lord [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Religions At Your Fingertips|author1=Michael McDowell |author2=Nathan Robert Brown |publisher=Penguin|year=2009|isbn=978-1-101-01469-1|page=38|quote=Marked by the turn of the Common Era, C.E., originally referred to as A.D., an abbreviation of the Latin ''Anno Domini'', meaning "Year of our God/Lord." This was a shortening of ''Anno Domini Nostri Jesu Christi'', meaning "Year of our God/Lord Jesus Christ."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of the Common Era notation assert that the use of BCE/CE shows sensitivity to those who use the same year numbering system as the one that originated with and is currently used by [[Christianity|Christians]], but who are not themselves Christian.&lt;ref name="RelTolrnc" /&gt;

Former United Nations Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], himself a [[Protestant]],&lt;ref name="kofifaith"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lefevere |first=Patricia |title=Annan: 'Peace is never a perfect achievement'&amp;nbsp;– United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan |publisher=National Catholic Reporter |date=11 December 1998 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_7_35/ai_53460476 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713031248/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_7_35/ai_53460476 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-13 |accessdate=2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; has argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he Christian calendar no longer belongs exclusively to Christians. People of all faiths have taken to using it simply as a matter of convenience. There is so much interaction between people of different faiths and cultures – different civilizations, if you like – that some shared way of reckoning time is a necessity. And so the Christian Era has become the Common Era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/ossg/sg/stories/articleFull.asp?TID=37 |title=Common values for a common era: Even as we cherish our diversity, we need to discover our shared values |author=Annan, Kofi A., (then Secretary-General of the United Nations) |date=28 June 1999 |publisher=Civilization: The Magazine of the Library of Congress |accessdate=2011-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501020027/http://www.un.org/News/ossg/sg/stories/articleFull.asp?TID=37 |archivedate=May 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Adena K. Berkowitz, when arguing at the Supreme Court opted to use BCE and CE because "Given the multicultural society that we live in, the traditional Jewish designations – B.C.E. and C.E. – cast a wider net of inclusion" &lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20180814202630/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/17/magazine/bc-ad-or-bce-ce.html |author=Safire, William |date=17 August 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition ===
Some oppose the Common Era notation for explicitly religious reasons. Because the BC/AD notation is based on the traditional year of the conception or birth of Jesus, some Christians are offended by the removal of the reference to him in era notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20061202/ai_n16891064|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012132926/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20061202/ai_n16891064|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 October 2007|last=Whitney|first=Susan|title=Altering history?

The forward to your book says B.C. and A.D. were removed so as to 'not impose the standards of one culture on others.'...&amp;nbsp;It's 2006 this year for anyone on Earth that is participating in day-to-day world commerce and communication. Two thousand six years since what? Most people know, regardless of their belief system, and aren't offended by a historical fact.|accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Southern Baptist Convention]] supports retaining the BC/AD abbreviations.&lt;ref name=SBC /&gt;

There are also secular concerns. English language expert [[Kenneth G. Wilson (author)|Kenneth G. Wilson]] speculated in his style guide that "if we do end by casting aside the AD/BC convention, almost certainly some will argue that we ought to cast aside as well the conventional numbering system [that is, the method of numbering years] itself, given its Christian basis."&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt; The short lived [[French Republican Calendar]], for example, began with the first year of the [[French First Republic]] and rejected the seven-day week (with its connections to the [[Book of Genesis]]) for a ten-day week.
Priest and writer on interfaith issues [[Raimon Panikkar]] contends that using the designation BCE/CE is a "return... to the most bigoted Christian colonialism" towards non-Christians, who do not necessarily consider the time period following the beginning of the calendar to be a "common era".&lt;ref name=Panikkar&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9-vYAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Panikkar,+Raimon+(2004).+Christophany:+The+Fullness+of+Man.
|last= Panikkar |first=Raimon |authorlink=Raimon Panikkar |title=Christophany: The Fullness of Man |location=Maryville, NY |publisher=Orbis Books |year=2004 |page=173|quote=Here is an example of the incarnation's historical-sociological implications among those who feel themselves furthest from Christianity. In certain North American academic circles one can see a return-with repercussions elsewhere-to the most bigoted Christian colonialism, along with the good intention of overcoming it. It has been suggested that the terminology of the Western calendar, Christian in origin, be replaced by one that presumably would be neutral and universal. It is understandable that some would protest the use of A.D. (anno Domini), but by eliminating B.C. (before Christ) and substituting B.C.E. (Before the Common Era) scholars betray the depths of the cultural impact of the historico-Christian event. After all, Jesus was not born in the year 1. We select a single event but without any value judgment. To call our age "the Common Era," even though for the Jews, the Chinese, the Tamil, the Muslims, and many others it is not a common era, constitutes the acme of colonialism.|accessdate=2011-05-18|isbn=978-1-57075-564-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' report, it was a student's use of BCE/CE notation, inspired by its use within [[Wikipedia]], which prompted the teacher and politician [[Andrew Schlafly]] to found [[Conservapedia]], a [[Cultural conservatism|cultural conservative]] [[wiki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Simon |first=Stephanie |title=A conservative's answer to Wikipedia|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/19/nation/na-schlafly19 |date=22 June 2007 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its "Conservapedia Commandments" is that users must always apply BC/AD notation, since its sponsors perceive BCE/CE notation to "deny the historical basis" of the dating system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservapedia.com/Conservapedia:Commandments Conservapedia Commandments] at Conservapedia&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conventions in style guides ==
The abbreviation BCE, just as with BC, always follows the year number. Unlike AD, which traditionally precedes the year number, CE always follows the year number (if context requires that it be written at all).&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt; Thus, the current year is written as {{currentyear}} in both notations (or, if further clarity is needed, as {{currentyear}} CE, or as AD {{currentyear}}), and the year that [[Socrates]] died is represented as 399 BCE (the same year that is represented by 399 BC in the BC/AD notation). The abbreviations are sometimes written with small capital letters, or with [[Full stop|periods]] (e.g., "&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;B.C.E.&lt;/span&gt;" or "C.E.").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/about15_rules.html |title=Major Rule Changes in The Chicago Manual of Style, Fifteenth Edition |year=2003 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |quote=Certain abbreviations traditionally set in small caps are now in full caps (AD, BCE, and the like), with small caps an option. |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070909071543/http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/about15_rules.html|archivedate=9 September 2007|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Style guides for academic texts on religion generally prefer BCE/CE to BC/AD.&lt;ref&gt;''SBL Handbook of Style'' [[Society of Biblical Literature]] 1999 "8.1.2 ERAS – The preferred style is B.C.E. and C.E. (with periods). If you use A.D. and B.C., remember that A.D. precedes the date and B.C. follows it. (For the use of these abbreviations in titles, see §&amp;nbsp;7.1.3.2.)"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar conventions in other languages ==
* In [[Germany]], Jews in [[Berlin]] seem to have already been using "(Before the) Common Era" in the 18th century, while others like [[Moses Mendelssohn]] opposed this usage as it would hinder the integration of Jews into German society.&lt;ref name="Jewish Joke" /&gt; The formulation seems to have persisted among German Jews in the 19th century in forms like ''vor der gewöhnlichen Zeitrechnung'' (before the common chronology).&lt;ref&gt;''Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums. Ein unpartheiisches Organ für alles jüdische Interesse'', II. Jahrgang, No. 60, Leipzig, 19. Mai 1838 (19 May 1838). See page 175 in [https://books.google.com/books?id=pwxFAAAAcAAJ Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums: Ein unpartheiisches Organ für alles jüdische Interesse in Betreff von Politik, Religion, Literatur, Geschichte, Sprachkunde und Belletristik, Volume 2] (Leipzig 1838).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|[[Julius Fürst]]}}, ''Geschichte des Karäerthums von 900 bis 1575 der gewöhnlichen Zeitrechnung'' (Leipzig 1862–1869).&lt;/ref&gt;
:In 1938 [[Nazi Germany]], the use of this convention was also prescribed by the [[National Socialist Teachers League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |page=149 |first=Karl Ludwig Freiherr |last=von und zu Guttenberg |author-link=Karl Ludwig Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg |url=http://www.monarchieforum.org/ARCHIV/WeisseBlaetter/MAI1938.pdf |date=May 1938 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119145938/http://www.monarchieforum.org/ARCHIV/WeisseBlaetter/MAI1938.pdf |archive-date=January 19, 2012 |title=Weiße Blätter: Monatschrift für Geschichte, Tradition u. Staat |accessdate=15 April 2018 |format= PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:However, it was soon discovered that many German Jews had been using the convention ever since the 18th century, and they found it ironic to see "[[Aryan]]s following Jewish example nearly 200 years later".&lt;ref name="Jewish Joke"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,759195,00.html |title=GERMANY: Jewish Joke |date=7 March 1938|accessdate=2012-02-05 |work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], Common forms used for "BC" are aC and a. de C. (for antes de Cristo, "before Christ"), with variations in punctuation and sometimes the use of J.C.(Jesucristo) instead of C. In scholarly writing, AEC is the equivalent of the English "BCE", antes de la Era Común or Before the Common Era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spanish.about.com/od/writtenspanish/qt/dates.htm |title=Writing Dates in Spanish |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Welsh language|Welsh]], OC can be expanded to equivalents of both AD (''Oed Crist'') and CE (''Oes Cyffredin''); for dates before the Common Era, CC (traditionally, ''Cyn Crist'') is used exclusively, as ''Cyn yr Oes Cyffredin'' would abbreviate to a mild obscenity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=welsh-termau-cymraeg;982a203b.0610 |title=Welsh-Termau-Cymraeg Archives |publisher=JISCMail |date=19 October 2006 |accessdate=2012-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason the terms ''common era'' and ''before the common era'', abbreviated as CE and BCE, have grown in popularity as designations.

'''Crisis Management Initiative''' ('''CMI''') is an independent [[Finland|Finnish]] [[non-governmental organisation]] that works to prevent and [[conflict resolution|resolve conflict]] through informal dialogue and mediation. [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate and former [[President of Finland]] [[Martti Ahtisaari]] founded CMI in 2000. CMI has offices in [[Helsinki]] and [[Brussels]] as well as a presence in selected countries. The organisation is officially registered as '''Crisis Management Initiative ry'''.

==Function==
CMI states it is focused on contributing to peace processes in three regions: [[MENA|the Middle East and North Africa]], [[Eurasia]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Self-statedly, CMI facilitates dialogue, mediates between conflicting sides, provides capacity-building and mediation support at all stages of conflict management and peace processes, and supports the broader peace building community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ngo-monitor.org/ngos/crisis-management-initiative-cmi/|title=Crisis Management Initiative (CMI)|last=|first=|date=2017-01-23|work=Institute for NGO Research|access-date=2018-01-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124070753/https://www.ngo-monitor.org/ngos/crisis-management-initiative-cmi/|archive-date=2018-01-24|dead-url=no|language=en-US|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Nobel Peace laureate and former President of Finland Martti Ahtisaari founded CMI on 24 August 2000.&lt;ref name="yhdistysnetti_cmi"&gt;{{Cite web | URL = http://yhdistysrekisteri.prh.fi/pertied.htx?kieli=3&amp;reknro=179786 | title = Crisis Management Initiative ry | work = AssociationNet | date = 2017-05-10 | location = Helsinki | publisher = Finnish Patent and Registration Office | accessdate = 2017-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After stepping down as the President of Finland that year, Ahtisaari declined the post of [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] because he wanted to focus instead on addressing the root causes of conflicts. President Ahtisaari's long-term vision with CMI was to  contribute to as much as effectively as possible to solving violent conflict throughout the world. The main tasks of the organisation in its early years were to assist Martti Ahtisaari in his numerous international assignments, to participate in policy discussions, and to advocate capacity-building in civilian crisis management.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

This led to CMI taking its own projects, at first concerning crisis management and later on expanding to peace building and conflict resolution projects. One of CMI's most visible assignments, the [[Aceh]] peace process began in late 2004. CMI and its chairman president Ahtisaari were asked to facilitate talks between the Government of Indonesia and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM). In 2008, President Ahtisaari was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his leading role in bringing independence to Namibia, Serbia's withdrawal from Kosovo, and autonomy for Aceh.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

'''Critical Commons''' is an online repository of user-generated media. The archive is a project of the [[Media Arts and Practice]] division of the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]]. The project supports the [[fair use]] of copyrighted media by educators.

== History ==
Critical Commons was established in 2008 by [[Steve F. Anderson]] and is an ongoing project of the [[Media Arts and Practice]] division of the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]]. Critical Commons was designed by [[Erik Loyer]] and developed using the free software video sharing system [[Plumi]] by the Asia-Pacific based [[EngageMedia]] and the Greece based design collective Unweb.me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criticalcommons.org/about-us |title=About — Critical Commons |publisher=Criticalcommons.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was launched with funding from the [[Macarthur Foundation]]'s Digital Media and Learning Initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cory Doctorow at 2:18 am Fri, Jan 22, 2010 |url=http://boingboing.net/2010/01/22/critical-commons-vs.html |title=Critical Commons vs. Hitler: resource for free/open media and fair use |publisher=Boing Boing |date=2010-01-22 |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hastac.org/projects/critical-commons |title=Critical Commons |publisher=HASTAC |date=2009-06-20 |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is part of an ongoing debate within higher education about the need for [[limitations and exceptions to copyright]].&lt;ref&gt;Guest, Charles; Guest, Joyce M.; Surry; Daniel W. ed.; and Robert M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3554">'''Forensic Economics''' as defined by the National Association of Forensic Economics is the scientific discipline that applies economic theories and methods to matters within a legal framework. Forensic economics covers, but is not limited to:
* The calculation of pecuniary damages in personal and commercial litigation.
* The analysis of liability, such as the statistical analysis of discrimination, the analysis of market power in antitrust disputes, and fraud detection.
* Other matters subject to legal review, such as public policy analysis, and business, property, and asset valuation.

In a 2012 paper by Eric Zitzewitz entitled “Forensic Economics,” ''Journal of Economic Literature'' 2012, 50(3), 731–769, published by the American Economic Association, "Forensic Economics" was defined as the application of economics to the detection and quantification of harm from behavior that has become the subject of litigation.

The only difference between these two definitions is that one suggests the application of science is itself a scientific discipline.  Notwithstanding this distinction, both definitions refer to the application of [[economics]].  While courts may dictate what economic issues are to be addressed, the economic science that is applied must be that which is taught and practiced in the world at large.

==Examples of applications of economics in litigation==
* Economic damages in injury and death
* Antitrust liability and economic damages
* Unfair practices in international trade
* Economic damages in copyright violation and patent infringement
* Contract violations
* Discrimination
* [[Economic damages]] related to physical and emotional abuse

{{Linguistics}}
'''Forensic linguistics''', '''legal linguistics''', or '''language and the law''', is the application of [[linguistics|linguistic]] knowledge, methods and insights to the [[forensic]] context of law, language, crime investigation, trial, and judicial procedure. It is a branch of [[applied linguistics]].

There are principally three areas of application for linguists working in forensic contexts:&lt;ref name=Aston&gt;{{Cite web |title=Centre for Forensic Linguistics |publisher=Aston University |url=http://www.forensiclinguistics.net/cfl_fl.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927010829/http://www.forensiclinguistics.net/cfl_fl.html |archivedate=27 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* understanding language of the written law,
* understanding language use in forensic and judicial processes, and
* the provision of linguistic evidence.

The discipline of forensic linguistics is not homogenous; it involves a range of experts and researchers in different areas of the field.

==History==

The phrase ''forensic linguistics'' first appeared in 1968 when Jan Svartvik, a professor of [[linguistics]], used it in an analysis of statements by [[Timothy John Evans]].&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008"&gt;John Olsson (2008), ''Forensic Linguistics, Second Edition''. London: Continuum {{ISBN|978-0-8264-6109-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was in regard to re-analyzing the statements given to police at [[Notting Hill]] police station in 1949 in the case of an alleged murder by Evans. Evans was suspected of murdering his wife and baby and was tried and hanged for the crime. Yet, when Svartvik studied the statements allegedly given by Evans, he found that there were different stylistic markers involved, and Evans did not actually give the statements to the police officers as had been stated at the trial.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Olsson, John. “What Is Forensic Linguistics?” ''[http://www.thetext.co.uk/what_is.pdf www.thetext.co.uk/what_is.pdf]'' (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Sparked by this case, early forensic linguistics in the UK were focused on questioning the validity of police interrogations. As seen in numerous famous cases (e.g. the convictions of Derek Bentley, the Guildford Four, the Bridgewater Three, etc.), many of the major concerns were of the statements police officers used. Numerous times, the topic of police register came up – this meaning the type of stylist language and vocabulary used by officers of the law when transcribing witness statements.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Moving to the US and the beginnings of the field of forensic linguistics, the field really began with the 1963 case of Ernesto Miranda. His case led to the creation of Miranda Rights and pushed focus of forensic linguistics on witness questioning rather than police statements. Various cases came about that challenged whether or not suspects truly understood what their rights meant – leading to a distinction of coercive versus voluntary interrogations.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

During the early days of forensic linguistics in the United Kingdom, the legal defense for many criminal cases questioned the authenticity of police statements. At the time, customary police procedure for taking suspects' statements dictated that it be in a specific format, rather than in the suspect's own words. Statements by witnesses are very seldom made in a coherent or orderly fashion, with speculation and backtracking done out loud. The delivery is often too fast-paced, causing important details to be left out.

Forensic linguistics can be traced back as early as a 1927 to a ransom note in Corning, New York. As the Associated Press reported&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. [http://nyshistoricnewspapers.org/lccn/sn84031094/1927-09-09/ed-1/seq-2/# "Think Corning Girl Wrote Ransom Note"]&lt;/ref&gt; in "Think Corning Girl Wrote Ransom Note" "Duncan McLure, of Johnson City uncle of the (kidnapped) girl, is the only member of the family to spell his name 'McLure' instead of 'McClure.' The letter he received, supposedly from the kidnappers, was addressed to him by the proper name, indicating that the writer was familiar with the difference in spelling."  Other work of forensic linguistics in the United States concerned the rights of individuals with regard to understanding their [[Miranda rights]] during the interrogation process.&lt;ref&gt;Olsson, John. "What Is Forensic Linguistics?" ''[http://www.thetext.co.uk/what_is.pdf www.thetext.co.uk/what_is.pdf]'' (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; An early application of forensic linguistics in the United States was related to the status of trademarks as words or phrases in the language. One of the bigger cases involved fast food giant [[McDonald's]] claiming that it had originated the process of attaching unprotected words to the 'Mc' prefix (referred to as [[McWords]]) and was unhappy with Quality Inns International's intention of opening a chain of economy hotels to be called 'McSleep'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Ayres, Jr | first = B. Drummond | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/22/us/mcdonald-s-to-court-mc-is-ours.html | title = McDonald's, to Court: 'Mc' Is Ours | date=22 July 1988 | accessdate = 19 March 2012 | publisher = [[The New York Times]] | location = [[New York City|New York]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Australian linguists discussed the application of linguistics and sociolinguistics to legal issues.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; They discovered that a phrase such as {{'}}''the same language''{{'}} is open to interpretation. Aboriginal people have their own understanding and use of 'English', something that is not always appreciated by speakers of the dominant version of English, i.e., 'white English'. The Aboriginal people also bring their own culturally-based interactional styles to the interview.

The 2000s saw a considerable shift in the field of forensic linguistics, which has been described as a coming-of-age of the discipline. Not only does the field have professional associations such as the International Association of Forensic Linguistics (IAFL) founded in 1993, and the Austrian Association for Legal Linguistics (AALL) founded in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;Austrian Association for Legal Linguistics. 2017. "Gründung der Österreichischen Gesellschaft für Rechtslinguistik. Abendgymnasium Wien. http://wien.abendgymnasium.at/gruendung-der-oesterreichischen-gesellschaft-fuer-rechtslinguistik/&lt;/ref&gt; it can now provide the scientific community with a range of textbooks such as Coulthard and Johnson (2007), Gibbons (2003) and Olsson (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Alison Johnson, Malcolm Coulthard. 2010. "Current debates in forensic linguistics". The Routledge Handbook of Forensic Linguistics. London: Routledge, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of study==
The range of topics within forensic linguistics is diverse, but research occurs in the following areas:

===The language of legal texts===
The study of the language of legal texts encompasses a wide range of forensic texts. That includes the study of text types and forms of analysis. Any text or item of spoken language can potentially be a forensic text when it is used in a legal or criminal context.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt; This includes analysing the linguistics of documents as diverse as Acts of Parliament (or other law-making body), private wills, court judgements and summonses and the statutes of other bodies, such as States and government departments. One important area{{Original research inline|date=November 2010}} is that of the transformative effect of [[Norman French]] and [[Latin|Ecclesiastic Latin]] on the development of the English common law, and the evolution of the legal specifics associated with it.  It can also refer to the ongoing attempts at making [[legal writing|legal language]] more comprehensible to laypeople.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

A forensic linguistics understanding of the relationship between language and law has been voiced by Leisser who states that 
* "It is indeed hard to deny that the rule of law is in fact the rule of language. It seems that there cannot be law without language. Kelsen (1945: 161) wrote that '[j]ust as everything King Midas touched turned into gold, everything to which the law refers becomes law, i.e. something legally e x i s t i n g'. The concept of law is conveyed and mediated entirely through the structures of human language and it is thus plausible to assume that everything the law touches is therefore also touched by language. This is particularly evident in the fact that all processes of legal meaning-making and meaning-seeking are inextricably tied to the language system. ... [L]aw is defined as a set of linguistic signs which is ascribed the societal power to control human conduct."&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Leisser]] (2017) ''„Adjectival Vagueness in Legal Language: The Case of the Austrian Civil Code“'' Vienna: University of Vienna, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===The language of legal processes===
Among other things, this area examines language as it is used in cross-examination, evidence presentation, judge's direction, police cautions, police testimonies in court, summing up to a jury, interview techniques, the questioning process in court and in other areas such as police interviews.

Police officers use specific language to elicit certain responses from civilians. Because of a police officers' social stature, and the way they often phrase "requests" as "commands", people may be confused as to what their rights are when they are being questioned by police. Officers use linguistic tactics including putting the blame onto the victim and asking questions with ambiguous phrasing to elicit specific responses from people (Solan, L. &amp; Tiersma, P, 2005).

A defendant using ambiguity in the courtroom may present issues and be deemed unacceptable. Specifically, when a victim is invoking their right to a lawyer, there are directions stating that the request may not come off as ambiguous. In fact, if the request is not stated in a way that the officer deems to be clear, the victim may not receive their request for counsel at all. Refer to the following link to explore an example through the ''Louisiana vs. Demesme'' case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasc.org/news_releases/2017/2017-052.asp|title=2017-052.asp|website=www.lasc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the examination process, language plays a substantial role in the presentation of a story to the courtroom. Specifically, the language used by the lawyer to construct the story to the courtroom elicits specific responses from the witness, and specific emotions from the jury. For example, in an instance where a lawyer is examining a hostile witness, they will often use language to limit the response of the witness, in order to avoid having the witness present conflicting evidence. In this instance, yes/no questions will be targeted, and questions with room for elaboration, such as wh-formation questions, will likely be avoided. In a situation where a lawyer interviews a friendly witness whose testimony could potentially strengthen the story constructed by the lawyer, the opposite may occur where wh-questions are targeted to allow for elaboration (Olsson, Luchjenborers, 2013).

Lawyers employs specific tactics for both themselves and their witnesses to come off as more or less truthful to the jury and the people of the courtroom. For example, the lawyer may refer to the witness by their first name or a nickname to humanize the witness, or they may speak using slang in order to create less social distance between himself and the courtroom. The lawyer may also avoid using slang, and instead use complicated law terminology to set himself apart from the courtroom and define his status (Olsson, Luchjenborers, 2013).

The lawyer works in constructing the language of the legal process of the courtroom, and specific witnesses may respond to the lawyer's questions in different ways, eliciting new language tactics and opinions from the jury. For example, witnesses may use direct or indirect speech based on their previous societal experiences, gender differences, socioeconomic differences, or differences in education level. Using particular dialects, slang, or sentence formations could assist in making the witness more or less truthful to the jury (Olsson, Luchjenborers, 2013).

==Forensic text types==

===Emergency call===
In an emergency call, the recipient or emergency operator's ability to extract primarily linguistic information in threatening situations and to come up with the required response in a timely manner is crucial to the successful completion of the call. Intonational emphasis, voice pitch and the extent to which there is cooperation between the caller and the recipient at any one time are also very important in analysing an emergency call. Full cooperation includes frank and timely responses.

Urgency plays a role in emergency calls, so hesitations, signs of evasiveness, and incomplete or overly short answers indicate that the caller might be making a false or hoax call. A genuine call has distinctive interlocking and slight overlap of turns. The recipient trusts the caller to provide accurate information and the caller trusts the recipient to ask only pertinent questions. If the caller uses a rising pitch at the end of every turn, it might represent a lack of commitment; the recipient's use of a rising pitch indicates doubt or desire for clarification. The call ideally moves from nil knowledge on the part of the recipient to a maximum amount of knowledge in a minimum possible period of time. This makes the emergency call unlike any other kind of service encounter.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt;

===Ransom demands or other threat communication===
Threat is a counterpart of a promise and is an important feature in a ransom demand. Ransom demands are also examined to identify between genuine and false threats. An example of a ransom note analysis can be seen in the case of the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]], where the first ransom note (sometimes referred to as the Nursery Note) stated: "We warn you for making anyding public or for notify the Polise the child is in gut care" (''sic'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/lindbergh/sfeature/crime.html|title=The Kidnapping|work=PBS Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the sentence, the kidnapper makes the claim that the child is in good hands but to make such a claim, the note would have to be written before the perpetrator enters the premises. Therefore, the claim is false (at the time of writing) since the kidnapper had not even encountered the child when he wrote the note.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ransom Notes: An Analysis of Their Content &amp; "Signature"|author=Falzini, Mark W.|work=Archival Ramblings|url=http://njspmuseum.blogspot.com/2008/02/one-of-most-fascinating-areas-of-study.html|date=9 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kidnappers may write statements that later end up being true, such as "your child is being held in a private location" being written ahead of time.

===Suicide letters===
A suicide note is typically brief, concise and highly propositional with a degree of evasiveness.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt; A credible suicide letter must be making a definite unequivocal proposition in a situational context. The proposition of genuine suicide is thematic, directed to the addressee (or addressees) and relevant to the relationship between them. Suicide notes generally have sentences alluding to the act of killing oneself, or the method of suicide that was undertaken.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2004" /&gt; The contents of a suicide note could be intended to make the addressee suffer or feel guilt. Genuine suicide letters are short, typically less than 300 words in length.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt; Extraneous or irrelevant material is often excluded from the text.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2004"&gt;John Olsson (2004). ''An Introduction to Language Crime and the Law''. London: Continuum International Publishing Group&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death row statements===
Death row statements either admit the crime, leaving the witness with an impression of honesty and forthrightness; or deny the crime, leaving the witness with an impression of innocence. They may also denounce witnesses as dishonest, critique law enforcement as corrupt in an attempt to portray innocence or seek an element of revenge in their last moments (Olsson 2004). Death row statements are within the heavily institutionalized setting of death row prisons.
The Forensic Linguistics Institute holds a corpus of these documents and is conducting research on them.

===Social media===
Social media statements are often context specific, and their interpretation can be highly subjective. Forensic application of a selection of stylistic and stylometric techniques in a simulated authorship attribution case involving texts has been done in relation to [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|author=C.S. Michell|year=2013|title=Investigating the use of forensic stylistic and stylometric techniques in the analysis of authorship on a publicly accessible social networking site (Facebook)|degree=MA in Linguistics|publisher=University of South Africa|url=http://uir.unisa.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10500/13324/dissertation_michell_cs.pdf?sequence=1|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of social media postings can reveal whether they are illegal (e.g. sex trade) or unethical (e.g. intended to harm) or whether they are not (e.g. simply provocative or free speech).&lt;ref&gt;C. Hardaker (2015). The ethics of online aggression: Where does “virtual” end, and “reality” begin? BAAL Conference on The Ethics of Online Research Methods. Cardiff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of linguistic evidence in legal proceedings==
These areas of application have varying degrees of acceptability or reliability within the field. Linguists have provided evidence in:
* [[Trademark]] and other intellectual property disputes
* Disputes of meaning and use
* Author identification (determining who wrote an anonymous text by making comparisons to known writing samples of a suspect; such as threat letters, mobile phone texts or emails)
* Forensic stylistics (identifying cases of [[plagiarism]])
* [[Voice identification]], also known as forensic phonetics, used to determine, through acoustic qualities, if the voice on a tape recorder is that of the defendant)
* [[Discourse analysis]] (the analysis of the structure of written or spoken utterance to determine who is introducing topics or whether a suspect is agreeing to engage in criminal conspiracy)
* Language analysis (forensic [[dialectology]]) tracing the linguistic history of [[asylum seeker]]s ([[Language Analysis for the Determination of Origin]])&lt;ref name="Tiersma, Peter" /&gt;
* Reconstruction of mobile phone text conversations
* Forensic phonetics

Specialist databases of samples of spoken and written natural language (called [[text corpus|corpora]]) are now frequently used by forensic linguists. These include corpora of suicide notes, mobile phone texts, police statements, police interview records and witness statements. They are used to analyse language, understand how it is used, and to reduce the effort needed to identify words that tend to occur near each other (collocations or collocates).

===Author identification===
The identification of whether a given individual said or wrote something relies on analysis of their [[idiolect]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard, M. (2004). Author identification, idiolect and linguistic uniqueness. ''Applied Linguistics'', 25(4), 431-447.&lt;/ref&gt; or particular patterns of language use (vocabulary, collocations, pronunciation, spelling, grammar, etc). The idiolect is a theoretical construct based on the idea that there is linguistic variation at the group level and hence there may also be linguistic variation at the individual level. [[William Labov]] has stated that nobody has found a "homogenous data" in idiolects,&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William (1972) ''Sociolinguistic patterns''. Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press, p192.&lt;/ref&gt; and there are many reasons why it is difficult to provide such evidence.

Firstly, language is not an inherited property, but one which is socially acquired.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, C. (1984). "Genre as social action." ''Quarterly Journal of Speech, pp 151-167&lt;/ref&gt; Because acquisition is continuous and life-long, an individual's use of language is always susceptible to variation from a variety of sources, including other speakers, the media and macro-social changes. Education can have a profoundly homogenizing effect on language use.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt; Research into authorship identification is ongoing. The term authorship attribution is now felt to be too deterministic.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, T. D. (2008). Approaching questions in forensic authorship analysis. In J. Gibbons &amp; M. T. Turell (Eds.), ''Dimensions of Forensic Linguistics''. Amsterdam: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;

The paucity of documents (ransom notes, threatening letters, etc) in most criminal cases in a forensic setting means there is often too little text upon which to base a reliable identification. However, the information provided may be adequate to eliminate a suspect as an author or narrow down an author from a small group of suspects.

Authorship measures that analysts use include word length average, average number of syllables per word, [[Article (grammar)|article]] frequency, type-token ratio, punctuation (both in terms of overall density and syntactic boundaries) and the measurements of [[hapax legomena]] (unique words in a text). Statistical approaches include [[factor analysis]], [[Bayesian statistics]], [[Poisson distribution]], [[multivariate analysis]], and [[discriminant function analysis]] of function words.

The Cusum (Cumulative Sum) method for text analysis has also been developed.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, A.Q., and S. Michaelson (1990) ''The Qsum Plot''. Internal Report CSR-3-90, Department of Computer Science, University of Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; Cusum analysis works even on short texts and relies on the assumption that each speaker has a unique set of habits, thus rendering no significant difference between their speech and writing. Speakers tend to utilize two to three letter words in a sentence and their utterances tend to include vowel-initial words.

In order to carry out the Cusum test on habits of utilizing two to three letter words and vowel-initial words in a sentential clause, the occurrences of each type of word in the text must be identified and the distribution plotted in each sentence. The Cusum distribution for these two habits will be compared with the average sentence length of the text. The two sets of values should track each other. Any altered section of the text would show a distinct discrepancy between the values of the two reference points. The tampered section will exhibit a different pattern from the rest of the text.

===Forensic stylistics===
This discipline subjects written or spoken materials (or both), to scientific analysis for determination and measurement of content, meaning, speaker identification, or determination of authorship, in identifying [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How does forensic linguistics/stylistics work in criminal issues? Answers|website=enotes.com|url=http://www.enotes.com/forensic-science/linguistics-forensic-stylistics|date=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} cases where forensic stylistics was used to detect [[plagiarism]] was the case of [[Helen Keller]]'s short story "[[The Frost King]]", in which the blind American author was accused of [[plagiarism]] in 1892. An investigation revealed that [[The Frost King]] had been plagiarised from Margaret Canby's ''Frost Fairies'' which had been read to Keller some time earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jamenjivarblog.wordpress.com/2014/06/05/when-helen-froze-over/|title=WHEN HELEN FROZE OVER|accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that Keller had made only minute changes to common words and phrases and used less common words to say the same thing, suggesting mere alterations to original ideas.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Keller used 'vast wealth' instead of 'treasure' (approximately 230 times less common in the language) 'bethought' instead of 'concluded' (approximately 450 times less common), 'bade them' instead of 'told them' (approximately 30 times less common). Keller used the phrase 'ever since that time' whilst Canby chose 'from that time' (the latter 50 times more common than the former). Keller also used ' I cannot imagine' whereas Canby used ' I do not know'. 'Know' is approximately ten times more common than 'imagine'. Keller relied on a lexis that is less common when compared to Canby's. The Flesch and [[Flesch-Kincaid]] readability test showed that Canby's text showing more originality compared to Keller's. Canby's text obtained a higher grade on the reading ease scale compared to Keller's. The distinctions between Keller and Canby's text are at the lexical and phrasal level.

Other examples of plagiarism include the cases between [[Richard Condon]], author of [[The Manchurian Candidate]] and English novelist [[Robert Graves]] and between [[Martin Luther King Jr]] and Archibald Carey. Judging by the text in ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'', Condon's work is seen to be rich in clichés such as ''"in his superstitious heart of hearts."'' While [[Helen Keller]] took pride in using rare phrases and avoids common source words, Condon was fond of expanding existing words into phrases and existing phrases into more extensive ones. Condon was also found to have borrowed from a wide range of Graves' work.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008"/&gt; However, in the plagiarism case between [[Martin Luther King Jr]] and Archibald Carey, almost half of King's doctoral dissertation was discovered to have been copied from another theology student. King simply changed the names of the mountains and used much more [[alliteration]] and [[assonance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Boston U. Panel Finds Plagiarism by Dr. King | date= 11 October 1991|accessdate=2008-06-14|work=The New York Times|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEFD61030F932A25753C1A967958260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carey's and Graves' texts (source texts) were noticeably shorter, pithier and simpler in structure while Condon's and King's texts relied on 'purple' devices, extending the existing text and flourish their language significantly.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Another famous example is the case of [[Theodore Kaczynski]], who was eventually convicted of being the "Unabomber", family members recognized his writing style from the published 35,000-word ''[[wikisource:Industrial Society and Its Future|Industrial Society and Its Future]]'' (commonly called the "Unabomber Manifesto"), and notified the authorities. FBI agents searching Kaczynski's hut found hundreds of documents written by Kaczynski but not published anywhere. An analysis produced by FBI Supervisory Special Agent James R. Fitzgerald identified numerous lexical items and phrases common to the two documents.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, J. R. (2004). "Using a forensic linguistic approach to tracking the Unabomber." In J. Campbell, &amp; D. DeNevi (Eds.)''Profilers: Leading investigators take you inside the criminal mind'' (pp. 193-222). New York: Prometheus Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Some were more distinctive than others, but the prosecution argued that even the more common words and phrases being used by Kaczynski became distinctive when used in combination with each other.&lt;ref name="Coulthard &amp; Johnson:2007" /&gt;

===Discourse analysis===
[[Discourse analysis]] deals with analyzing written, oral, or sign language use, or any significant [[semiotic]] event. According to the method, the close analysis of a covert recording can produce useful deductions. The use of 'I' instead of 'We' in a recording highlights non-complicity in a conspiracy. The utterance of 'yeah' and 'uh-huh' as responses indicate that the suspect understands the suggestion, while feedback markers such as 'yeah' and 'uh-huh' do not denote the suspect's agreement to the suggestion. Discourse analysts are not always allowed to testify but during preparation for a case they are often useful to lawyers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Linguistic dialectology===
This refers to the study of dialects in a methodological manner based on anthropological information. It is becoming more important to conduct systematic studies of dialects, especially within the English language, because they are no longer as distinct as they once were due to the onslaught of mass media and population mobility. Political and social issues have also caused languages to straddle geographical borders resulting in certain language varieties spoken in multiple countries, leading to complications when determining an individual's origin by means of his/her language or dialect.

Dialectology was used during the investigations into the [[Wearside Jack|Yorkshire Ripper tape hoax]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Fido (1994), ''The Chronicle of Crime: The infamous felons of modern history and their hideous crimes''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forensic phonetics===
The forensic phonetician is concerned with the production of accurate transcriptions of what was being said. Transcriptions can reveal information about a speaker's social and regional background. Forensic phonetics can determine similarities between the speakers of two or more separate recordings.  Voice recording as a supplement to the transcription can be useful as it allows victims and witnesses to indicate whether the voice of a suspect is that of the accused, i.e., alleged criminal.

A man accused of manufacturing the drug [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]] was mis-heard by the police transcriber as 'hallucinogenic'&lt;ref name="Coulthard &amp; Johnson:2007"&gt;Coulthard, M., &amp; Johnson, A. (2007). ''An introduction to forensic linguistics: Language in evidence''. Oxford: Routledge:162-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The police transcriber heard ''"but if it's as you say it's hallucinogenic, it's in the Sigma catalogue."'' However, the actual utterance was ''"but if it's as you say it's German, it's in the Sigma catalogue."''

Another disputed utterance was between a police officer and a suspect. One of the topics of conversation was a third man known as 'Ernie'. The poor signal of the recording made 'Ernie' sound like 'Ronnie'. The surveillance tape presented acoustic problems: an intrusive electronic-sounding cackle, the sound of the car engine, the playing of the car radio, the movement of the target vehicle, and the intrusive noise coincided with the first syllable of the disputed name.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008"/&gt;

[[Forensic speechreading]] is the complement of forensic voice identification. Transcripts of surveilled video records can sometimes allow expert speechreaders to identify speech content or style where the identity of the talker is apparent from the video record.

===Examples===
Evidence from forensic linguistics has more power to eliminate someone as a suspect than to prove him or her guilty.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Linguistic expertise has been employed in criminal cases to defend an individual suspected of a crime, and during government investigations. Forensic linguists have given expert evidence in a wide variety of cases, including abuse of process, where police statements were found to be too similar to have been independently produced by police officers; the authorship of [[hate mail]]; the authorship of letters to an Internet child pornography service; the contemporaneity of an arsonist's diary; the comparison between a set of mobile phone texts and a suspect's police interview, and the reconstruction of a mobile phone text conversation. Some well-known examples include an appeal against the conviction of [[Derek Bentley]] the identification of [[Subcomandante Marcos]], the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]]' charismatic leader by [[Max Appedole]] and the identification of [[Theodore Kaczynski]] as the so-called "[[Unabomber]]" by [[James R. Fitzgerald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/manhunt-unabomber-fbi-ted-kaczynski-james-fitzgerald-643594|title='Manhunt: Unabomber' explores how a federal investigator caught Ted Kaczynski and changed FBI profiling forever|date=2017-07-29|work=Newsweek|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal laboratories ''Bundeskriminalamt'' (in Germany) and the ''Nederlands Forensisch Instituut'' (in the [[Netherlands]]) both employ forensic linguists.&lt;ref name="Tiersma, Peter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languageandlaw.org/FORENSIC.HTM|title=forensic linguistics|first=peter|last=tiersma|website=www.languageandlaw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic linguistics contributed to the overturning of [[Derek Bentley]]'s conviction for murder in 1998 although there were other non-linguistic issues. Nineteen-year-old Bentley, who was [[Functional illiteracy|functionally illiterate]], had been hanged in 1953 for his part in the murder of PC Sidney Miles; he had been convicted partly on the basis of his statement to police, allegedly transcribed verbatim from a spoken [[monologue]]. When the case was reopened, a forensic linguist found that the frequency and usage of the word "then" in police transcripts suggested the transcripts were not verbatim statements but had been partially authored by police interviewers; this and other evidence led to Bentley's posthumous pardon.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard, R.M. (2000). " ''Whose text is it? On the linguistic investigation of authorship'' ", in S. Sarangi and R.M. Coulthard: ''Discourse and Social Life''. London, Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;
During the investigative stage to identify Subcomandante Marcos, the [[Mexican government]] speculated that he was a dangerous guerrilla fighter. This theory gained much traction at the end of 1994, after the dissident Zapatista Comandante, Salvador Morales Garibay, gave away the identity of his former fellow Zapatistas to the Mexican government, among them Marcos' identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letraslibres.com/sites/default/files/pdfs_articulos/pdf_art_5673_5540.pdf «El otro subcomandante»] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017111100/http://www.letraslibres.com/sites/default/files/pdfs_articulos/pdf_art_5673_5540.pdf |date=2013-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They all were indicted for terrorism, arrest warrants were issued and arrests were made in a military action.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5tZRlQk_8s»]&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican government alleges some Zapatistas to be terrorists, among them Marcos. There was a storm of political pressures claiming for a fast military solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis. On February 9, 1995, in a televised special Presidential broadcast, President [[Ernesto Zedillo]] announced Subcomandante Marcos to be one Rafael Sebastián Guillén Vicente, born June 19, 1957, in [[Tampico]], [[Tamaulipas]] to [[Spain|Spanish]] immigrants, an [[Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana]] School of Sciences and Arts for the Design former Professor. And after the government revealed Marcos' identity in January 1995, when Max Appedole, old friend, classmate with the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] at the [[Instituto Cultural Tampico]], made direct intervention in the conflict. Appedole played a major role with the Mexican government to avoid a Military solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis, by demonstrating that contrary to the accusations announced by President Ernesto Zedillo,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzUQqpDptm8»]&lt;/ref&gt; Rafael Guillén, was no terrorist. Max Appedole identified Marcos' linguistic fingerprint based on Marcos' specific, unique way of speaking, recognized his literary style in all Marcos' manifestos that were published in the media, linked them to their literary tournaments organized by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in which they competed in Mexico. Everyone has an [[idiolect]], encompassing vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation, that differs from the way other people talk. He confirmed that he had no doubt that Marcos was his friend Rafael Guillén, a pacifist. Max Appedole closed the first successful linguistic profiling confirmation case in the history of law enforcement. Based on these achievements this new science was developed, giving way to what is now called forensic linguistics. This motivated a new Division of forensic linguistics called Criminal Profiling in Law Enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=243839|title=Marcos, en la mira de Zedillo - Proceso|date=5 August 2002|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://enlineadirecta.info/?option=view&amp;article=12183«Marcos Sí es Sebastián Guillén»]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzos.com.mx/images/pdf/buzos195.pdf«La Otra Campana Pintada de Azul»]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hemeroteca.proceso.com.mx/?page_id=278958&amp;a51dc26366d99bb5fa29cea4747565fec=169802&amp;rl=wh« Maestros y condiscípulos de Tampico recuerdan a Rafael Guillén»]&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic linguistic evidence also played a role in the investigation of the 2005 disappearance of Julie Turner, a 40-year-old woman living in [[Yorkshire]]. After she was reported missing, her partner received several [[text message]]s from Julie's mobile phone, such as "Stopping at jills, back later need to sort my head out", and "Tell kids not to worry. sorting my life out. (sic) be in touch to get some things".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/science/12file-text.html Speech Patterns in Messages Betray a Killer], Elizabeth Svoboda, ''[[New York Times]]'' May 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators found that letters written by Turner's friend Howard Simmerson shared several unusual orthographic and punctuation features with the text messages, suggesting that Simmerson had been aware of the contents of the messages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1197187/Dear-Garry-Ive-decided-end-The-stop-trapped-killer.html Dear Garry.

19-year old [[Murder of Jenny Nicholl|Jenny Nicholl]] disappeared on 30 June 2005. [[Murder conviction without a body|Her body was never found]], giving police and forensic scientists little information to go on about what might have happened to Jenny. After looking through her phone for clues, forensic linguists came to the conclusion that the texts sent from her phone around the time that she disappeared seemed very different than her usual texting style, and soon started looking to her ex-boyfriend, David Hodgson, for clues of what happened to her, including looking through his phone and studying his texting style. The forensic linguists found a number of stylistic similarities between David's texting style and the messages sent from Jenny's phone around the time she went missing. Using the timeframe of when she went missing, combined with the differences in texting styles and other forensic details, Jenny's [[Murder|murderer]], David Hodgson, was convicted. The analysis of the text messages and their submission in court helped to pave the way for forensic linguistics to be acknowledged as a science in UK law, rather than opinion. To this day, her body has not been found, but justice was still served for her and her family because of forensic linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mitchell|first1=Elizabeth|title=The case for forensic linguistics|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7600769.stm|work=BBC News|date=8 September 2008|access-date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic linguist John Olsson gave evidence in a murder trial on the meaning of 'jooking' in connection with a stabbing.&lt;ref&gt;Trial of Rehan Asghar, Central Criminal Court, London, January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the appeal against the conviction of the [[Bridgewater Four]], the forensic linguist examined the written confession of Patrick Molloy, one of the defendants&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; a confession which he had retracted immediately&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and a written record of an interview which the police claimed took place immediately before the confession was dictated. Molloy denied that the interview had ever taken place, and the analysis indicated that the answers in the interview were not consistent with the questions being asked. The linguist came to the conclusion that the interview had been fabricated by police. The conviction against the Bridgewater Four was quashed before the linguist in the case, Malcolm Coulthard, could produce his evidence.

In an Australian case reported by Eagleson, a "farewell letter" had apparently been written by a woman prior to her disappearance. The letter was compared with a sample of her previous writing and that of her husband. Eagleson came to the conclusion that the letter had been written by the husband of the missing woman, who subsequently confessed to having written it and to having killed his wife. The features analysed included sentence breaks, [[markedness|marked]] [[Thematic relation|themes]], and deletion of [[preposition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Eagleson, Robert. (1994). 'Forensic analysis of personal written texts: a case study', John Gibbons (ed.), ''Language and the Law'', London: Longman, 362&amp;ndash;373.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, there was a horrible house fire where a father was able to save his children, but his wife died in the house. The police thought that the fire was actually not an accident, but instead was a cover-up of the father murdering the mother. The forensic linguists were able to obtain the phone of both the father and mother, and realized that there were texts still being sent from the mother's phone the whole day – long after the police thought she had died. Using information from the two phones, the linguists were able to study the texting styles of both parents to see if they could obtain any more information about what happened that day. It turned out that the texts sent from the wife's phone were actually the husband pretending to be the wife so that no one would know she was murdered, and everyone would believe that she perished in the house fire. The forensic linguists were able to figure this out by studying the husband's texting style, spelling errors, and more, and were able to come to the conclusion that the texts sent after the wife was thought to be deceased, was actually the husband texting off her phone pretending to be her. Without this knowledge, it would have been much more difficult to convict the husband of [[Murder|murder]] and get justice for the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yvxmbk/forensic-linguists-use-spelling-mistakes-to-help-convict-criminals|title=Forensic Linguists Use Spelling Mistakes to Help Convict Criminals|date=9 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional concepts==

===Linguistic fingerprinting===
A linguistic fingerprint is a concept put forward by some scholars that each human being uses language differently, and that this difference between people involves a collection of markers which stamps a speaker/writer as unique; similar to a fingerprint. Under this view, it is assumed that every individual uses languages differently and this difference can be observed as a fingerprint.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt;  It is formed as a result of merged language style. A person's linguistic fingerprint can be reconstructed from the individual's daily interactions and relate to a variety of self-reported personality characteristics, situational variables and physiological markers (e.g. blood pressure, cortisol, testosterone).&lt;ref&gt;Pennebaker, J. W. (1990). 'Physiological factors influencing the reporting of physical symptoms'. ''The Science of Self-report: Implications for Research and Practice.'' Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum Publishers, pp. 299-316&lt;/ref&gt; In the process of an investigation, the emphasis should be on the relative rather than absolute difference between the authors and how investigators can classify their texts. John Olsson, however, argues that although the concept of linguistic fingerprinting is attractive to law enforcement agencies, there is so far little hard evidence to support the notion.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt;

===Variation===
Intra-author variations are the ways in which one author's texts differ from each other. Inter-author variations are the ways in which different authors' writing varies. Two texts by one author do not necessarily vary less than texts by two different authors.
*'''Genre:''' When texts are being measured in different genres, considerable variation is observed even though they are by the same author.
*'''Text Type:''' Personal letters contain more inter-relationship bonding strategies than academic articles or term papers.
*'''Fiction vs. Non-Fiction:''' Some fiction writers are journalists. Due to the different demands of each medium, they can be completely different from one another and this results in intra-author variation.
*'''Private vs Public:''' A politician writing a political speech, which is a public text,  will differ greatly from a private text to a friend or family member.
*'''Time lapse:''' The greater the time lapse between two works, the greater the likely variation. Language changes more than we realize in a relatively short span of time, influencing our susceptibility to language changes around us.
*'''Disguise:''' A writer can publish pseudonymously or anonymously, disguising output to prevent recognition.

===Forensic transcription===
The two main types of transcriptions are written documents and video and audio records. Accurate, reliable text transcription is important because the text is the data which becomes the available evidence. If a transcription is wrong, the evidence is altered. If there is failure to transcribe the full text, evidence is once again altered unwittingly. There must be emphasis on the text being the evidence. A transcription of an audio file should never be assumed to be completely accurate. Each type of transcription contains its own problems. A handwritten document might contain unusual spellings which may result in ambiguous meanings, illegible handwriting and illustrations that are difficult to comprehend. A scanned document is tricky, as it may alter the original document. Audio and video documents can include repetitions, hesitation, nonsensical talk, jargon which can be hard to understand and speakers mumbling incoherently and inaudibly. Non-linguistic sounds such as crying and laughing may also be included in the audio and video text which cannot be transcribed easily.  Because of this, civil libertarians argued that interrogations in major criminal cases should be recorded and the recordings kept, as well as transcribed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/15/opinion/recording-police-questioning.html | work=The New York Times | title=Recording Police Questioning | date=15 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Halloween]], a contraction of "All Hallows' Eve", is a celebration observed on 31 October, the day before the feast of [[All Hallows' Day|All Hallows']]. The celebrations and observances of this day occur primarily in regions of the Western world, although some traditions vary significantly between geographical areas.

==Origins==
{{Main article|Halloween}}
Halloween, also spelled as Hallowe'en or Allhallowe'en, is a contraction of All Hallows' Eve, the eve or [[vigil]] before the Western Christian feast of All Hallows (or All Saints) which is observed on 1 November. This day begins the triduum of [[Hallowtide]], which culminates with [[All Souls' Day]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], many Christians held a folk belief that All Hallows' Eve was the "night where the veil between the material world and the [[Christian views on Hades|afterlife]] was at its most transparent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devros|first1=Isabelle|title=Little monsters play on All Hallow's Eve|url=http://www.armidaleexpress.com.au/story/2662750/little-monsters-play-on-all-hallows-eve/?cs=475|publisher=The Armidale Express|accessdate=2014-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==

===China===
The Chinese celebrate the "Hungry Ghost Festival" in mid-July, when it is customary to float river lanterns to remember those who have died. By contrast, Halloween is often called "All Saints' Day" (''Wànshèngjié'', 萬聖節), or (less commonly, but more correctly) "All Saints' Eve" (''Wànshèngyè'', 萬聖夜) or "Eve of All Saints' Day" (''Wànshèngjié Qiányè'', ''萬聖節前夕''), stemming from the term "All Hallows Eve" (hallow referring to the souls of holy saints). Chinese Christian churches hold religious celebrations. Non-religious celebrations are dominated by expatriate Americans or Canadians, but costume parties are also popular for Chinese young adults, especially in large cities. [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] and [[Ocean Park Hong Kong|Ocean Park]] ([[Ocean Park Halloween Bash|Halloween Bash]]) host annual Halloween shows.

[[Mainland China]] has been less influenced by [[Anglo]] traditions than Hong Kong and Halloween is generally considered "foreign". As Halloween has become more popular globally it has also become more popular in China, however, particularly amongst children attending private or international schools with many foreign teachers from North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Wu Ni|date=30 October 2013|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2013-10/30/content_17070057.htm|title=Halloween gaining popularity but still sees cultural differences|work=[[China Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hong Kong====

Traditional "door-to-door" trick or treating is not commonly practiced in Hong Kong due to the vast majority of Hong Kong residents living in high-rise apartment blocks. However, in many buildings catering to expatriates, Halloween parties and limited trick or treating is arranged by the management. Instances of street-level trick or treating in Hong Kong occur in ultra-exclusive gated housing communities such as [[The Beverly Hills]] populated by Hong Kong's super-rich and in expatriate areas like Discovery Bay and the Red Hill Peninsula. For the general public, there are events at Tsim Sha Tsui's Avenue of the Stars that try to mimic the celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gohongkong.about.com/od/hongkongfestivals/a/halloweeninhk.htm|title=Events and Celebrations for Halloween in Hong Kong|last=Boland|first=Rory|date=30 October 2009|work=About.com|accessdate=31 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Lan Kwai Fong]] area of Hong Kong, known as a major entertainment district for the international community, a Halloween celebration and parade has taken place for over 20 years, with many people dressing in costume and making their way around the streets to various drinking establishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lan Kwai Fong Halloween Street Party |url=http://www.lankwaifong.com/halloween/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101071409/http://www.lankwaifong.com/halloween/ |archivedate=1 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many international schools also celebrate Halloween with costumes, and some put an academic twist on the celebrations such as the "Book-o-ween" celebrations at [[Hong Kong International School]] where students dress as favorite literary characters.

===Japan===
[[File:Halloweendisplay-2012-saitama.jpg|thumb|A Halloween display in a local bank window, in [[Saitama prefecture|Saitama]], Japan.]]
Halloween arrived in [[Japan]] mainly as a result of American [[popular culture|pop culture]]. As recently as 2009, it was not appreciated and only celebrated by expats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ashcraft|first1=Brian|title=Japan's Infamous Halloween Trains|url=https://kotaku.com/japans-infamous-halloween-trains-1819762246|accessdate=24 October 2017|work=[[Gizmodo]]|date=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wearing of elaborate [[costume]]s by young adults at night is recently very popular in areas such as [[Amerikamura]] in [[Osaka]] and [[Shibuya]] in [[Tokyo]], where, in October 2012, about 1700 people dressed in costumes to take part in the Halloween Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/News_Photos/Features/Halloween-in-Japan/fp/7197 |title=Halloween in Japan |publisher=UPI.com |date=26 October 2012 |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The holiday has become popular with young adults as a costume party and club event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-japan-fell-in-love-with-halloween-for-adults-2014-10-30|last=Richards|first=Jeff W.|title=How Japan fell in love with Halloween for adults|work=Market Watch|publisher=Dow Jones|date=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trick or Treating for Japanese children has taken hold in some areas. The [[Yakuza]] have taken advantage of the festival by hosting parties and giving snacks and sweets to children, a tradition which goes back at least for 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/11/01/national/yamaguchi-gumi-henchmen-make-kobe-kids-offer-cant-refuse-halloween-sweets/#.WJQPZGczWM8

===Philippines===
The period from 31 October through 2 November is a time for remembering dead family members and friends. Many Filipinos travel back to their hometowns for family gatherings of festive remembrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://asianjournal.com/lifestyle/how-do-we-spell-halloween-in-the-philippines/|last1=Canopio|first1=Camille|last2=Distor|first2=Tessa|title=How do we spell 'Halloween' in the Philippines?|work=Asian Journal|date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trick-or treating is gradually replacing the dying tradition of ''Pangangaluluwâ'', a local analogue of the old English custom of [[souling]]. People in the provinces still observe ''Pangangaluluwâ'' by going in groups to every house and offering a song in exchange for money or food. The participants, usually children, would sing carols about the souls in [[Purgatory]], with the ''abúloy'' (alms for the dead) used to pay for Masses for these souls. Along with the requested alms, householders sometimes gave the children ''[[Suman (food)|suman]]'' (rice cakes). During the night, various small items, such as clothing, plants, etc., would "mysteriously" disappear, only to be discovered the next morning in the yard or in the middle of the street. In older times, it was believed that the spirits of ancestors and loved ones visited the living on this night, manifesting their presence by taking an item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-509344 |title=Halloween in the Philippines – CNN iReport |publisher=Ireport.cnn.com |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the observation of [[Christmas in the Philippines|Christmas]] traditions in the Philippines begins as early as September, it is a common sight to see Halloween decorations next to Christmas decorations in urban settings.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

===Singapore===
Around mid-July Singapore Chinese celebrate "[[Ghost Festival#Singapore and Malaysia|Zhong Yuan Jie / Yu Lan Jie]]" (Hungry Ghosts Festival), a time when it is believed that the spirits of the dead come back to visit their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Library Board, Singapore |url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_758_2004-12-16.html |title=Zhong Yuan Jie (Mid-Year Festival) |publisher=Infopedia |accessdate=20 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140212235245/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_758_2004-12-16.html |archivedate=12 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, Halloween celebrations are becoming more popular, with influence from the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/Mailbox/Story/A1Story20101101-245033.html |title=What's the big fuss about Halloween? |publisher=News.asiaone.com |date=1 November 2010 |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, there were over 19 major Halloween celebration events around Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halloween.sg/2012-singapore-halloween-events-and-parties |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818010706/http://www.halloween.sg/2012-singapore-halloween-events-and-parties |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 August 2013 |title=2012 Singapore Halloween Events And Parties – Singapore Halloween |publisher=Halloween.sg |accessdate=21 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SCAPE's Museum of Horrors held its fourth scare fest in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=*SCAPE Admin|url=https://scape.sg/public/sources/pdf/SCAPE_Annual_Report_FY1415.pdf|title=Scare Actors Audition&amp;#124; Museum of Horrors IV: The Twins|publisher=Scape.com.sg|date=23 July 2013|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Halloween Horror Nights#Universal Studios Singapore|Universal Studios Singapore]] hosts "Halloween Horror Nights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halloweenhorrornights.com.sg/|title=Halloween Horror Nights 7|website=Halloween Horror Nights 7|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia and New Zealand==
[[File:Halloween display in Sydney.jpg|thumb|Halloween display in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].]]
While not traditionally a part of Australian culture, non-religious celebrations of Halloween modeled on [[North America]]n festivities are growing increasingly popular in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halloween-australia.com/|title=Halloween in Australia - Halloween Australia|website=Halloween Australia|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in spite of seasonal differences and the transition from spring to summer. Criticism stems largely from the fact that Halloween has little relevance to Australian culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,26283533-421,00.html |title=Should Australians be Hallo-weaned off Halloween celebrations? |work=news.com.au |date=31 October 2009 |accessdate=1 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101035209/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C27574%2C26283533-421%2C00.html |archivedate= 1 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smh&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/hell-of-a-row-as-kids-buy-into-imported-halloween-rituals-20091031-hqpn.html|title=Hell of a row as kids buy into imported Halloween rituals|first1=Rachel|last1=Browne|first2=Jonno|last2=Seidler|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=1 November 2009|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also considered, by some Australians, to be an unwanted American influence; as although Halloween does have Celtic/European origins, its increasing popularity in Australia is largely as a result of American pop-culture influence.&lt;ref name=smh /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/comments/0,23600,26283533-421,00.html |title=Should Australians be Hallo-weaned off Halloween celebrations?

Due to the opposition to Halloween by some people, there is a growing movement where people are inviting trick-or-treaters to take part by putting a balloon or decoration on their letter box, to indicate that they are welcome to come knocking. In the past decade, the popularity of Halloween in Australia has grown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-30/love-it-or-hate-it-halloween-likely-to-continue-in-australia/6889420|title=Halloween: a festival that polarises Australians|date=30 October 2015|website=Abc.net.au|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New Zealand, as in neighbouring Australia, Halloween is not celebrated to the same extent as in North America, although in recent years the non-religious celebrations have been achieving some popularity especially among young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kiwifamilies.co.nz/articles/halloween/ |title=Halloween in NZ |author=Kiwi Families |date= |accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/halloween/|title=Halloween|website=My.christchurchcitylibraries.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trick-or-treat has become increasingly popular with minors in New Zealand over the years, despite being not a "British or Kiwi event" that purely is only influenced by American globalization.&lt;ref name="NZHeraldTrickTreat"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=12151853 |title=Halloween trick or treating: How old is too old?

==Europe==
Over the years, Halloween has become more successful in Europe and has been partially ousting some older customs like the ''{{ill|Rübengeistern|de|display=y}}'' ({{lang-en|turnip ghosts, beet spirit}}), [[Martinisingen]], and others.&lt;ref Name="Hör"&gt;Halloween in der Steiermark und anderswo, Volkskunde (Münster in Westfalen), Hrsg. Editha Hörandner, LIT Verlag Münster, 2005 {{ISBN|3825888894}}. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Sweden===
On All Hallow's Eve, a [[Requiem Mass]] is widely attended every year at [[Uppsala Cathedral]], part of the Lutheran [[Church of Sweden]].&lt;ref name="VlasBoari2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vlas|first1=Natalia|last2=Boari|first2=Vasile|title=Religion and Politics in the 21st Century: Global and Local Reflections|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443850766|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the period of Allhallowtide, starting with All Hallow's Eve, Swedish families visit churchyards and adorn the graves of their family members with lit candles and wreaths fashioned from pine branches.&lt;ref name="VlasBoari2013"/&gt;

Among children, the practice of dressing in costume and collecting candy has gained popularity in recent years.&lt;ref name="Phil2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pihl|first1=Anne|title=Halloween – my first time trick-or-treating in Sweden|url=http://www.relocatetosweden.com/en/halloween-first-time-trick-treating-sweden/|website=Relocate To Sweden|date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
Halloween is a work day in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and not celebrated until recently. For the past few years, it has been popular among younger generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sarajevo-x.com/showtime/clanak/111101038|title=Upoznajte sarajevske vještice i vješce&amp;nbsp;– Klix.ba|work=Sarajevo-x.com|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since wearing masks has become highly popular among children and teenagers, e.g. in many Bosnian schools, both elementary as well as high schools (secondary schools and vocational), students will usually wear costumes and masks on Halloween. There it is called ''Noć vještica'' ({{lang-en|Night of Witches}}).

===Germany===
Halloween was not generally observed in Germany prior to the 1990s, but has been increasing in popularity. It has been associated with the influence of United States culture, and "Trick or Treating" (in German, ''"Süßes sonst gibt's Saures"'') has been occurring in various German cities, especially in areas such as the [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]] neighborhood in Berlin, which was part of the American zone during the [[Cold War]]. Today, Halloween in Germany brings in 200 million euros a year, through multiple industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Das Geschäft mit dem Gruselfest: Aus Halloween wird Hallowahn - Stuttgarter Zeitung|url = http://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.das-geschaeft-mit-dem-gruselfest-aus-halloween-wird-hallowahn.efeab0e3-fdb3-4035-b698-62048e30f267.html|website = stuttgarter-zeitung.de|accessdate = 2015-10-31|language = de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halloween is celebrated by both children and adults. Adults celebrate at themed costume parties and clubs, while children go trick or treating. Complaints of vandalism associated with Halloween "Tricks" are increasing, particularly from many elderly Germans unfamiliar with "Trick or Treating".&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Neate and Nicholas Connolly (31 October 2013), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/rise-of-halloween-culture-sees-backlash-in-germany-a-931005.html Holiday Backlash: Germans Cringe at Rise of Halloween] ''[[Der Spiegel]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
Halloween has been increasing in popularity in [[Greece]] during the 2010s, as a commercial and secular celebration. It has been associated with the influence of the western culture. Bars, nightclubs and fun parks organise Halloween parties.

In Italy [[All Saints' Day]] is a public holiday. On 1 November, ''Tutti i Morti'' or [[All Souls' Day]], families remember loved ones who have died. These are still the main holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.italiarail.com/halloween-italy|title=Halloween in Italy - ItaliaRail - Italy Train Ticket and Rail Pass Experts|website=Italiarail.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some Italian tradition, children would awake on the morning of All Saints or All Souls to find small gifts from their deceased ancestors.

===Romania===
Romanians observe the [[St. Andrew's Day|Feast of St. Andrew]], patron saint of Romania, on 30 November. On St. Andrew's Eve ghosts are said to be about. A number of customs related to divination, in other places connected to Halloween, are associated with this night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://traditionsacrosseurope.wordpress.com/2008/11/25/st-andrews-day-in-romania/ |title=St. Andrew's Day in Romania |publisher=Traditionsacrosseurope.wordpress.com |date=2008-11-25 |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the popularity of Dracula in western Europe, around Halloween the Romanian tourist industry promotes trips to locations connected to the historical [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad Tepeș]] and the more fanciful Dracula of [[Bram Stoker]]. The most successful Halloween Party in Transylvania takes place in [[Sighișoara]], the citadel where Vlad the Impaler was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visit-transylvania.co.uk/romania-travel-transylvania/halloween-party-transylvania.html|title=Transylvania Live – Awarded Halloween in Transylvania Party, Halloween Short Break, Dracula Short Break, Romania travel|publisher=Visit-transylvania.co.uk|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=November 2015}}

===Russia===
In Russia most Christians are Orthodox, and in the Orthodox Church Halloween is on the Saturday after Pentecost and therefore 4–5 months before western Halloween. Celebration of western Halloween began in the 1990s around the downfall of the Soviet regime, when costume and ghoulish parties spread throughout night clubs throughout Russia. Halloween is generally celebrated by younger generations and is not widely celebrated in civic society (e.g. theaters or libraries). In fact, Halloween is among the Western celebrations that the Russian government and politicians—which have grown increasingly anti-Western in the early 2010s—are trying to eliminate from public celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shuster|first1=Simon|title=Russian Region Wages War on Halloween|url=http://world.time.com/2013/10/31/halloween-extremist-says-russian-region-enacting-ban/|website=World.time.com|accessdate=24 October 2014|date=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bennetts|first1=Marc|title=Nyet on Halloween: Russian church warns of 'dangers'; Siberia bans holiday|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/30/authorities-warn-russians-dangers-halloween/|accessdate=24 October 2014|work=Washington Times|date=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia: Activist calls for Halloween ban|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-29742511|accessdate=24 October 2014|work=BBC News|date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland and the Czech Republic===
Since the [[fall of Communism]] in 1989, Halloween has become increasingly popular in Poland and the Czech Republic. Particularly, it is celebrated among younger people. The influx of Western tourists and expats throughout the 1990s introduced the costume party aspect of Hallowe'en celebrations, particularly in clubs and at private house parties. Door-to-door trick or treating is not common.  Pumpkin carving is becoming more evident, following a strong North American version of the tradition.

===Switzerland===
In [[Switzerland]], Halloween, after first becoming popular in 1999, is on the wane, and is most popular with young adults who attend parties. Switzerland already has a "festival overload" and even though Swiss people like to dress up for any occasion, they do prefer a traditional element, such as in the [[Fasnacht]] tradition of chasing away winter using noise and masks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Home/Archive/Halloween_retailers_get_a_shock.html?cid=6223458|title=Interest in Halloween in Switzerland starts to wane|work=Swissinfo.ch|date=31 October 2007|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lenews.ch/2014/10/30/halloween-in-switzerland/ Taylor, Pamela.

====England====
{{See also|Mischief Night}}
In the past, on All Souls' Eve families would stay up late, and little "soul cakes" were eaten. At the stroke of midnight, there was solemn silence among households, which had candles burning in every room to guide the souls back to visit their earthly homes and a glass of wine on the table to refresh them. The tradition of giving soul cakes that originated in Great Britain and Ireland was known as [[souling]], often seen as the origin of modern [[trick or treating]] in North America, and souling continued in parts of England as late as the 1930s, with children going from door to door singing songs and saying prayers for the dead in return for cakes or money.&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;{{cite book|first=Nicholas|last=Rogers|title=Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|pages=28–30|isbn=0-19-514691-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional customs and [[folklore|lore]] include [[divination]] practices, ways of trying to predict the future.

==Canada==
Scottish emigration, primarily to Canada before 1870 and to the United States thereafter, brought the Scottish version of the holiday to each country. The earliest known reference to ritual begging on Halloween in English speaking North America occurs in 1911, when a newspaper in [[Kingston, Ontario]] reported that it was normal for the smaller children to go street "[[guising]]" on Halloween between 6 and 7 p.m., visiting shops and neighbours to be rewarded with nuts and candies for their rhymes and songs.&lt;ref name="ATP"/&gt; Canadians spend more on candy at Halloween than at any time apart from Christmas.

==United States==
In the United States, where lingering [[Puritan]] tradition restricted the observance of many holidays, Halloween did not become a holiday until the 19th century. The transatlantic migration of nearly two million Irish following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Great Famine (1845–1849)]] brought the holiday to the United States.

American librarian and author [[Ruth Edna Kelley]] wrote the first book length history of the holiday in the U.S., ''The Book of Hallowe'en'' (1919), and references [[souling]] in the chapter "Hallowe'en in America": "All Hallowe'en customs in the United States are borrowed directly or adapted from those of other countries. The taste in Hallowe'en festivities now is to study old traditions, and hold a Scotch party, using [[Robert Burns]]'s poem ''[[Halloween (poem)|Halloween]]'' as a guide; or to go a-souling as the English used. In short, no custom that was once honored at Hallowe'en is out of fashion now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/boh/boh17.htm |title=The Book of Hallowe'en: Chapter XV: Hallowe'en in America |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main event for children of modern Halloween in the United States and Canada is [[trick-or-treating]], in which children, teenagers, (sometimes) young adults, and parents  (accompanying their children) disguise themselves in [[Halloween costume|costume]]s and go door-to-door in their neighborhoods, ringing each doorbell and yelling "Trick or treat!" to solicit a gift of candy or similar items.&lt;ref name=ADH&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Nicholas|year=2002|chapter=Coming Over: Halloween in North America|title=Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night|pages=49–77|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-516896-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teenagers and adults will more frequently attend Halloween-themed costume parties typically hosted by friends or themed events at nightclubs either on Halloween itself or a weekend close to the holiday.

At the turn of the 20th century, Halloween had turned into a night of [[vandalism]], with destruction of property and cruelty to animals and people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyise.org/hallowhistory.html |title=Halloween History |publisher=Nyise.org |accessdate=21 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031031331/http://www.nyise.org/hallowhistory.html |archivedate=31 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1912, the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys Clubs]], and other neighborhood organizations came together to encourage a safe celebration that would end the destruction that had become so common on this night.

The commercialization of Halloween in the United States did not start until the 20th century, beginning perhaps with [[Halloween card|Halloween postcards]] (featuring hundreds of designs), which were most popular between 1905 and 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shaktiweb.com/postcards|title=Antique Halloween Postcards and E-cards|accessdate=14 September 2006|last=Anderson|first=Richard|year=2000|publisher=shaktiweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dennison Manufacturing Company (which published its first Halloween catalog in 1909) and the Beistle Company were pioneers in commercially made Halloween decorations, particularly die-cut paper items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spookshows.com/beistle/beistle.htm|title=Beistle: An American Halloween Giant|accessdate=14 September 2006|author=Dawn Kroma|author2=Lou Kroma|publisher=Spookshows.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halloweencollector.com/history|title=A Brief History of Halloween Collectibles|accessdate=14 September 2006|last=Ledenbach|first=Mark B.|publisher=halloweencollector.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; German manufacturers specialised in Halloween figurines that were exported to the United States in the period between the two World Wars.

Halloween is now the United States' second most popular holiday (after Christmas) for decorating; the sale of candy and costumes is also extremely common during the holiday, which is marketed to children and adults alike. The [[National Confectioners Association]] (NCA) reported in 2005 that 80% of American adults planned to give out candy to trick-or-treaters.&lt;ref name="candyusa.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.candyusa.org/Media/Seasonal/Halloween/pr_2005.asp|title=Trick-or-treaters can expect Mom or Dad's favorites in their bags this year|accessdate=14 September 2006|year=2005|publisher=National Confectioners Association|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827010441/http://www.candyusa.org/Media/Seasonal/Halloween/pr_2005.asp|archivedate=27 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington, DC: The National Retail Federation.&lt;/ref&gt;{{when?|date=November 2018}} Each year, popular costumes are dictated by various current events and pop culture icons. On many college campuses, Halloween is a major celebration, with the Friday and Saturday nearest 31 October hosting many costume parties. Other popular activities are watching horror movies and visiting haunted houses. Total spending on Halloween is estimated to be $8.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Halloween Headquarters|url=https://nrf.com/resources/consumer-data/halloween-headquarters|publisher=[[National Retail Federation]]|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events===
[[File:Slick Chicks Halloween 1947.jpg|thumb|upright|Four contestants in the Halloween Slick Chick beauty contest in [[Anaheim, California]], 1947]]
Many theme parks stage Halloween events annually, such as [[Halloween Horror Nights]] at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] and [[Universal Orlando]], [[Mickey's Halloween Party]] and [[Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party]] at [[Disneyland Resort]] and [[Magic Kingdom]] respectively, and [[Knott's Scary Farm]] at [[Knott's Berry Farm]]. One of the more notable parades is [[New York's Village Halloween Parade]]. Each year approximately 50,000 costumed marchers parade up [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycgo.com/events/village-halloween-parade1|title=Village Halloween Parade|website=NYCgo.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salem, Massachusetts]], site of the [[Salem witch trials]], celebrates Halloween throughout the month of October with tours, plays, concerts, and other activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://salemhalloweencity.com/halloween-events-activities-salem/|title=SALEM HALLOWEEN EVENTS FESTIVALS ACTIVITIES|website=Salemhalloweencity.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of venues in New York's lower Hudson Valley host various events to showcase a connection with [[Washington Irving]]'s ''[[Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]''. [[Van Cortlandt Manor]] stages the "Great Jack o' Lantern Blaze" featuring thousands of lighted carved pumpkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/10/04/7-halloween-events-you-wont-want-to-miss/|last=Dawson|first=Mackensie|title=7 Halloween events you won't want to miss|work=New York Post|date=4 October 2014|access-date=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some locales have had to modify their celebrations due to disruptive behavior on the part of young adults. [[Madison, Wisconsin]] hosts an [[State Street Halloween Party|annual Halloween celebrations]]. In 2002, due to the large crowds in the State Street area, a riot broke out, necessitating the use of mounted police and tear gas to disperse the crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/state/nov02/93044.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222212133/http://www.jsonline.com/news/state/nov02/93044.asp |archivedate=22 February 2006 |title=Halloween revelers erupt in Madison|date=4 November 2002|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|accessdate=18 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Chapel Hill, NC|Chapel Hill]], site of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], has a [[Halloween on Franklin Street|downtown street party]] which in 2007 drew a crowd estimated at 80,000 on downtown Franklin Street, in a town with a population of just 54,000. In 2008, in an effort to curb the influx of out-of-towners, mayor Kevin Foy put measures in place to make commuting downtown more difficult on Halloween.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/264/story/1276364.html|title=Chapel Hill to goblins: stay away|date=31 October 2008|publisher=The News &amp; Observer|accessdate=31 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103052017/http://www.newsobserver.com/264/story/1276364.html|archivedate=3 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, large crowds of college students rioted at the Keene, New Hampshire [[Pumpkin Fest (New Hampshire)|Pumpkin Fest]], whereupon the City Council voted not to grant a permit for the following year's festival,&lt;ref name="City Council Reject Pumpkin Fest Permit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concordmonitor.com/home/16367372-95/keene-city-council-rejects-pumpkin-fest-permit |title=Keene City Council rejects pumpkin fest permit |publisher=Concord Monitor |date=3 April 2015 |accessdate=3 April 2015 |author=Associated Press |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407050152/http://www.concordmonitor.com/home/16367372-95/keene-city-council-rejects-pumpkin-fest-permit |archivedate=7 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and organizers moved the event to [[Laconia, New Hampshire|Laconia]] for 2015.&lt;ref name="Laconia-hosting"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sexton|first1=Adam|title=It's official: Laconia will host this year's pumpkin festival|url=http://www.wmur.com/news/its-official-laconia-will-host-this-years-pumpkin-festival/32551994|publisher=[[WMUR-TV]]|accessdate=23 September 2015|date=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saint Helena===
In [[Saint Helena]], Halloween is actively celebrated, largely along the American model, with ghosts, skeletons, devils, vampires, witches and the like. Imitation pumpkins are used instead of real pumpkins because the pumpkin harvesting season in Saint Helena's hemisphere is not near Halloween.  Trick-or-treating is widespread.  Party venues provide entertainment for adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.saint.fm/Independent/20091030.pdf|title=Entertainment &amp; Events|format=PDF|publisher=St Helena Independent|date=30 October 2009|accessdate=30 October 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720172608/http://www.saint.fm/Independent/20091030.pdf|archivedate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dominican Republic===
In the [[Dominican Republic]] it has been gaining popularity, largely due to many Dominicans living in the States and then bringing it to the island. In the larger cities of [[Santiago de los Caballeros|Santiago]] or [[Santo Domingo]] it has become more common to see children trick-or-treating, but in smaller towns and villages it is almost entirely absent, partly due to religious opposition. Tourist areas such as [[Sosua]] and [[Punta Cana]] feature many venues with Halloween celebrations, predominantly geared towards adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kiskeya.life/why-dont-dominicans-celebrate-halloween/|title=Why Don't Dominicans Celebrate Halloween? |website=Kiskeya.life|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homespun offers music instruction for many instruments and styles on CD, DVD and streaming media.

==History==
[[Happy Traum]]'s inspiration for Homespun came in 1967, when he was a musician and part-time guitar teacher in New York City. When he moved to Woodstock, New York and began to tour with his brother [[Artie Traum]], he made tapes (based on his 1965 book ''Fingerpicking Styles for Guitar'') for his guitar students to use when he was unavailable.&lt;ref name=HS-puremusic-2017&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.puremusic.com/71happy1.html|title=Puremusic interview with Happy Traum|work=puremusic.com|accessdate=July 5, 2017|author=Frank Goodman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also received letters from others who wanted to learn to play, so he made more tapes and sold them via classified advertisements in ''[[Guitar Player]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and ''[[Sing Out!]]'' magazines.&lt;ref name=HS-monitor-1993&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacLachlan|first1=Suzanne L.
|title=Homespun Tapes Runs with Music Giants|url=https://m.csmonitor.com/1993/0913/13061.html|accessdate=July 5, 2017|work=Christian Science Monitor|date=September 13, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HS-rollmag-2011&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cordtz|first1=Kay|title=Documenting the Greats, Teaching the New: Happy and Jane Traum’s Homespun Tapes and Video|url=http://www.rollmagazine.com/archive/jul11/articles/music.php|accessdate=July 7, 2017|work=Roll Magazine|date=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He decided to turn this effort into the Homespun business, with his wife Jane as co-owner and his brother Artie assisting. They invited musicians they knew to record instructional tapes. [[Bill Keith (musician)|Bill Keith]] (banjo) and [[Kenny Kosek]] (fiddle) were among the first to participate.&lt;ref name=HS-deseret-1989&gt;{{cite news|last1=staff writer|first1= |title=Tapes Bring Homespun Sound Home|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/43034/TAPES-BRING-HOMESPUN-SOUND-HOME.html?pg=all|accessdate=July 7, 2017|work=Deseret News|date=April 20, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homespun's first instructional lessons were recorded in Traum's home and sold on five-inch reel-to-reel tapes, as cassettes were not yet generally available.&lt;ref name=HS-whichside-2005&gt;{{cite book |last=Weissman|first=Dick|authorlink= |date=2005|title=Which Side Are You On?: An Inside History of the Folk Music Revival in America|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Which_Side_Are_You_On.html?id=ocXMnBpa-DYC|access-date=July 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tapes were manually reproduced one by one at home: thus the name "Homespun."&lt;ref name=HS-rollmag-2011 /&gt;

Traum produced the sessions, and provided guidance for artists who were uncomfortable teaching.&lt;ref name=HS-namm-2017&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.namm.org/library/oral-history/jane-traum|title=Oral Histories: Jane Traum|work=NAMM.org|accessdate=July 7, 2017|author= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the business grew, Traum traveled to other locations to record more musicians, and invited musicians outside their circle of friends to participate.&lt;ref name=HS-puremusic-2017 /&gt;

In 1983, Homespun introduced music instruction on VCR tapes, before most homes had video players. Through the years, Homespun has expanded its audio and video formats, moving from audio cassette and video tape to CDs, DVDs, and streaming media.&lt;ref name=HS-billboard-1997&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bessman|first1=Jim|title=Homespun Turns 30 with CD Instructional, Video Lines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7QkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=homespun+music+instruction&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=V2a56is6-B&amp;sig=BdlbEe13wwqmkjoYz9BpOVZvM70&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjq9fjD-fjUAhUU1GMKHX9gAUc4HhDoAQgjMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=homespun%20music%20instruction&amp;f=false|accessdate=July 7, 2017|work=Billboard|date=November 8, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HS-rhythm-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Patience|first1=Iain|title=Happy Traum Interview|url=https://rhythms.com.au/happy-traum-interview-by-iain-patience/|accessdate=July 5, 2017|work=Rhythms|date=March 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hal Leonard Corporation]] has been distributing Homespun products since 1995. Homespun products are also sold at their website, and the Roots music channel offers a web subscription service for Homespun streaming media.&lt;ref name=HS-retailer-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Van Dyke|first1=Matthew|title=Hal Leonard &amp; Homespun Celebrate 20 Years Together|url=http://msretailer.com/hal-leonard-homespun-celebrate-20-years-together/

'''Identification''' is a key term for the discussion of [[rhetoric]] in [[Kenneth Burke]]′s ''[[A Rhetoric of Motives]]''. He uses it to evaluate the traditional perception of [[rhetoric]] as persuasion.  Burke suggests that whenever someone attempts to persuade someone else, [[Identification (psychology)|identification]] occurs, because for persuasion to occur, one party must "identify" with another. That is, the one who becomes persuaded sees that one party is like another in some way. Burke's definition of identification works not only in relation to the self (e.g. that tree has arms and is like me, thus I identify with that tree) it also refers to exterior identification (e.g. that man eats beef patties like that group, thus he is identified with that beef-patty-eating group). One can perceive identification between objects that are not the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Rhetoric of Motives|last=Burke|first=Kenneth|publisher=University of California Press|year=1969|isbn=0-520-01546-0|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Rhetoric of Motives'' opens with an analysis of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'' and [[Matthew Arnold]]'s ''[[Empedocles on Etna]]''; from his analysis, Burke eventually extricates the term “identification.”  From there, Burke uses the term to reclaim certain elements of rhetoric that have fallen away, while simultaneously expanding it to show how “identification” supplements traditional emphases on persuasion as central. The concept of identification, argues Burke, gives us an additional way of looking at rhetoric's role in [[human relations]], specifically ways in which people enact [[social cohesion]].

==Identification and the Realm of Rhetoric==

In particular, the concept of identification can expand our vision of the realm of rhetoric as more than solely agonistic. To be sure, that is the way we have traditionally situated it: “Rhetoric,” writes Burke, “is ''par excellence'' the region of the Scramble, of insult and injury, bickering, squabbling, malice and the lie, cloaked malice and the subsidized lie. . . . We begin with an anecdote of killing (in ''Samson Agonistes'' and “Empedocles on Etna”), because [[invective]], [[eristic]], [[polemic]], and [[logomachy]] are so pronounced an aspect of rhetoric” (19-20). But while impelled to acknowledge this nature, we can look for more from rhetoric, he argues:
: “We need never deny the presence of strife, enmity, factions, as a characteristic motive of rhetorical expression. We need not close our eyes to their almost tyranneous ubiquity in human relations; we can be on the alert always to see how such temptations to strife are implicit in the institutions that condition human relationships; yet we can at the same time always look beyond this order, to the principle of identification in general, a [[terministic]] choice justified by the facts that the identifications in the order of love are also characteristic of rhetorical expression.” (20)

==Facets of Identification==

What is identification? Burke spends most of the rest of Section I of ''A Rhetoric of Motives'' exploring the concept, at the same time hammering out the realm of rhetoric.

===Identification and Consubstantiality===

In identifying with the interests of another (or being persuaded that shared interests exist, even if they do not), one is “substantially one” with that other, or ''[[consubstantial.]]'' At the same time, each individual can retain unique substance. ''Substance,'' a recurring Burkean theme, was examined in terms of its “universal paradoxes” in ''[[Grammar of Motives]]'' and in its manifestations as unique constructed acts in ''[[Symbolic of Motives]];'' here, in the ''Rhetoric,'' substance is examined in its implications of division. To “identify with” is to become consubstantial, but, at the same time, as the ''Rhetoric'' shows us, “to begin with ‘identification’ is, by the same token, though roundabout, to confront the implications of division” (22).

It is in this key discussion of identification, [[consubstantiality]], and division that Burke lays out his crucial definition of the realm of rhetoric:
: “Insofar as the individual is involved in conflict with other individuals or groups, the study of this same individual would fall under the head of ''Rhetoric''. . . . The ''Rhetoric'' must lead us through the Scramble, the Wrangle of the Market Place, the flurries and flare-ups of the Human Barnyard, the Give and Take, the wavering line of pressure and counterpressure, the Logomachy, the onus of ownership, the War of Nerves, the War.” (23)

===Identification and Property===

In metaphysics, “a thing is identified by its ''properties”'' (23), but a rhetorical identification by property refers to material, economic property. Identification by material property is ethical, Burke states, but it is also the source of turmoil and discord when identifications establishing themselves through property come into relation with one another. The importance of property and the simultaneous, overlapping cooperation and conflict it entails make property and identification a key rhetorical topic, Burke says: “Put identification and division ambiguously together, so that you cannot know for certain just where one ends and the other begins, and you have the characteristic invitation to rhetoric. . . . The wavering line between the two cannot be ‘scientifically’ identified; rival rhetoricians can draw it at different places, and their persuasiveness varies with the resources each has at hand” (25).

In this section, Burke also notes the way identification functions as a screen, placing the term again firmly within the realm of rhetoric. Using science as an example, Burke explains that “however ‘pure’ one’s motives may be actually, the impurities of identification lurking about the edges of such situations introduce a typical Rhetorical wrangle of the sort that can never be settled once and for all, but belongs in the field of moral controversy where men properly seek to ‘prove opposites’” (26).

===Identification and Autonomy===

Identification can also be seen as the way in which specialized activities occupy, rather than transcend or escape, larger contexts: “The fact that an activity is capable of reduction to intrinsic, autonomous principles does not argue that it is free from identification with other orders of motivation extrinsic to it. Such other orders are extrinsic to it, as considered from the standpoint of the specialized activity alone. However, they are not extrinsic to the field of moral action as such, considered from the standpoint of human activity in general. . . . ‘Identification is a word for the autonomous activity’s place in this wider context.” (27)

Identification in this particular aspect is thus yet another major path into, or topic of, rhetoric; for example, “we are clearly in the region of rhetoric when considering the identifications whereby a specialized activity makes one a participant in some social or economic class. ‘Belonging’ in this sense is rhetorical.” (28) Such identification can become sinister when unacknowledged or hidden. Moreover, consubstantiality implies that sinister morality can spread through both substances, as when the morality associated with a so-called autonomous activity serves as the morality for the larger context with which it is identified: “One’s morality as a specialist cannot be allowed to do duty for one’s morality as a citizen. Insofar as the two roles are at odds, a specialty at the service of sinister interests will itself become sinister.” (31)

===Identification and Cunning===

Here Burke suggests expanding the realm of rhetoric to include the ways in which we operate rhetorically upon ourselves, forging identifications through unexamined or nonconscious motives, self-protective or suicidal. “If a social or occupational class is not too exacting in the scrutiny of identifications that flatter its interests, its very life is a profitable malingering (profitable at least until its inaccuracies catch up with it) — and as such, it is open to attack or analysis, Rhetoric comprising both the ''use'' of persuasive resources ''(rhetorica utens,'' as with the philippics of Demosthenes) and the study of them ''(rhetorica docens,'' as with Aristotle’s treatise on the ‘art’ of Rhetoric)” (36). The key element here that brings in cunning is consciousness, or perhaps more to the point, purposeful unconsciousness, or hypocrisy: “This aspect of identification, whereby one can protect an interest merely by not using terms incisive enough to criticize it properly, often brings rhetoric to the edge of cunning” (36).

[[File:Butantan 4818627920 417a496667 o.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Theodore Roosevelt]] at the Instituto Butantan in 1914]]
'''Instituto Butantan''' (in modern [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], '''Instituto Butantã'''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Butantan ou Butantã? Instituto Butantã ou Butantan?|url = http://dicionarioegramatica.com.br/2015/12/12/butantan-ou-butanta-instituto-butanta-ou-butantan/|website = DicionarioeGramatica.com|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;, {{IPA-pt|ĩʃtʃiˈtutu butɐ̃ˈtɐ̃|pron}}) is a [[Brazil]]ian [[biologic medical product|biologic]] research center located in Butantã, in the western part of the city of São Paulo, Brazil. '''Instituto Butantan''' is a public institution affiliated with the [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] State Secretariat of [[Health]] and considered one of the major scientific centers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Butantan Institute: History and Future Perspectives|journal = PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases|date = 2014-07-03|issn = 1935-2727|pmc = 4080994|pmid = 24992341|volume = 8|issue = 7|doi = 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002862|first = Marcelo|last = De Franco|first2 = Jorge|last2 = Kalil}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Butantan''' is the largest immunobiologicals and biopharmaceuticals producer in Latin America (and one of the largest in the world). It is world-renowned for its collection of venomous snakes, as well as those of venomous lizards, [[spider]]s, [[insect]]s and [[scorpion]]s. By extracting the reptiles' and insects' venoms, the Institute develops antivenoms and medicines against many diseases, which include tuberculosis, rabies, tetanus and diphtheria.

== History ==
The Institute was founded by the Brazilian [[physician]] and biomedical scientist [[Vital Brazil]] in 1901, according to [[Pasteur Institute]] paradigm, i.e., by combining in the same institution [[medical research]], the transfer of the results to society as health products, and self-financing through this later activity. Its foundation was a reaction to the outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] in the city of [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]].&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;  It is internationally renowned for its research on [[venom (poison)|venomous]] animals; it was visited by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in 1912. It is also a state-supported producer of [[vaccine]]s against many [[infectious diseases]], such as [[rabies]], [[hepatitis]], [[botulism]], [[tetanus]], [[diphtheria]], [[pertussis]] and [[tuberculosis]], as well as polyvalent and monovalent [[antivenom]]s against the bites of [[snakes]], [[lizards]], [[bees]], [[scorpion]]s and [[spider]]s (which, historically were first developed in the beginning of the 20th century by Dr. Vital Brazil and his coworkers).  Among the distinguished scientists at the institute were biochemists [[Karl Slotta]] and [[Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat]], pioneers in the study of progesterone, estriol, and medical use of venom, from 1935 to 1948.

A fire in 2010 destroyed the collection facility, which maintained one of the largest collections of venomous animals in the world, comprising around 80,000 snake specimens, and an estimated 450,000 spiders and scorpions.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

The name of the institute comes from "''Butantã''",&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; a district in the west zone of São Paulo. "''Butantã''" itself is a [[Tupian languages|Tupi]] word&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; meaning "''crushed soil''".

== Education and research ==

The Institute develops basic and applied biomedical research in many areas, including [[molecular biology]], [[immunology]] and [[epidemiology]] and has a graduate research training program in collaboration with other institutions, in the areas of biotechnology and [[infectology]]. Besides its research laboratories, production units and specialized library, it operates an animal breeding center for providing subjects for research and production of sera.  The Instituto Butantan also operate the "Hospital Vital Brazil", a specialist hospital that offers free treatment for poisonous animal stings and bites. The institute also accepts donations of serpents, arthropods and other animals captured by the public and by a network of collaborating centers and individuals.

The following research laboratories are part of the Butantan Institute:
* [[Arthropod]]s
* [[Herpetology]]
* [[Cellular biology]]
* [[Immunogenetics]]
* [[Immunopathology]]
* [[Virus|Viral]] [[Immunology]]
* [[Immunochemistry]]
* [[Genetics]]
* [[Dermatology]]
* [[Pathophysiology]]
* [[Biochemistry]] and [[Biophysics]]
* [[Pharmacology]]
* [[Microbiology]]
* [[Parasitology]]
* [[Biopharmaceutical]]s
* Applied [[Toxinology]]
* [[Biotechnology]] Center

Important Brazilian scientists who have worked in the Butantan Institute are: [[Vital Brazil]], [[Afrânio Pompílio Gastos do Amaral]], [[Isaias Raw]], [[Samuel Pessoa]], [[Willy Beçak]]. The Institute has strong collaborative ties with the [[Pasteur Institute]], [[Paris]], France, and with the [[Oswaldo Cruz Foundation]], [[Rio de Janeiro]].

== Production ==
The Butantan Institute is the largest producer in [[Latin America]] (and one of the largest in the world) of immunobiologicals and biopharmaceuticals. In 2001 it produced ca. {{Nowrap|110 million}} doses of vaccines and {{Nowrap|300 thousand}} vials of hyperimmune sera. The institute is responsible for the production of 90% of the vaccines used in Brazil.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;  The institute contains a venom farm where researchers milk around a thousand snakes for their [[venom]] which is used to make [[antivenom]]s and for medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eveleigh|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The production units manufacture the following bioproducts:

=== Hyperimmune sera and antivenoms ===
* Anti-[[Bothrops|Bothropic]]
* Anti-[[Rattlesnake|Crotalic]]
* Anti-Bothropic-Crotalic
* Anti-[[Elapidae|Elapidic]]

== Public activities ==
The Butantan Institute is one of the major touristic and educational attractions in a vast park area in the city section of [[Butantã (district of São Paulo)|Butantã]] in São Paulo. It has a [[serpentarium]], a historical museum, a biological museum, and a museum of microbiology. The venom farm is a major attraction and visitors can see the snakes housed in representations of their natural environments. The park also contains rare tree types.

== Butantan Foundation ==
The '''Fundação Butantan''' is a non-profit corporation established in 1984 to use more efficiently public funds and capital investments made by the Ministry of Health for the production of immunobiologicals. The Foundation reinvests part of the proceeds to build new facilities for new products. Part of the funds are used in the Institute for research and cultural activities, as well as to provide its workers with meals and basic food supplies.

== 2010 fire ==
On May 15, 2010, a fire almost burned down the laboratory and destroyed the Institute's entire collection of snake specimens (approximately 85,000 specimens preserved with [[formaldehyde]] and stored in 70% [[ethanol]]) and ca. 450,000–500,000 specimens of scorpions and spiders (also stored in ethanol).&lt;ref name="number specimens destroyed"/&gt; It was one of the largest collections of snakes in the world.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Over 90 years of research were lost.

The fire started at {{Nowrap|7:08 am}} and was brought under control by a crew of 50 firemen an hour and a half later.&lt;ref name="fire put out"/&gt;  News reports have claimed that the facility was not prepared for a fire, not having a [[fire alarm]] or [[fire sprinkler system|sprinkler system]].&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;  Police are investigating the fire which has been described by curator Francisco Franco as "a loss for humanity".&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;  None of the live animals or people at the institute was harmed by the fire.&lt;ref name="live animals unharmed"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4729">The '''Internet Shakespeare Editions''' is a non-profit organization that produces a website devoted to [[William Shakespeare]] and his works. The organization is an associate member of the [[Shakespeare Theatre Association of America]], under the classification of theatre service provider,&lt;ref&gt;Livingstone, Roberta, ''Quarto'', Spring-Summer 2001, "[http://www.staaonline.org/files/Quarto%20Spring-Summer%202001.pdf Shakespeare Theatre Association of America]", accessed 4 Feb 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and is supported by the [[University of Victoria]] and the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada]].

The website includes a variety of Shakespeare-related resources, including fully annotated texts of his plays and poems, multimedia materials and records of his plays in performance, and historical information about Shakespeare's life and the Renaissance.

== History ==

The project began on a floppy disc in 1988, which creator Michael Best called ''Shakespeare's Life and Times.'' In 1994 he transferred it to CD-ROM. By 1996, Best decided that the Internet was the ideal medium for his Shakespeare project. He translated his earlier formats into a web  format and formally founded the Internet Shakespeare Editions in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Times Colonist, ''Williams World'', 23 April 2008, "[http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/story.html?id=e91a60df-c9dc-4528-96f6-c1e9a56f6e58&amp;k=78059 CanWest MediaWorks Publications]", accessed 2 Feb 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the freely accessible site was redesigned to include advertisements.

In addition to the website, the Internet Shakespeare Editions also published a CD-ROM titled ''A Shakespeare Suite.'' The CD-ROM, published in 2002 and distributed by Insight Media, is a companion tool for Shakespeare studies designed for teachers and students.&lt;ref&gt;Steggle, Matthew, [http://purl.oclc.org/emls/09-2/stegbest.html ''Review of Internet Shakespeare Editions, A Shakespeare Suite CD-Rom'']. Early Modern Literary Studies 9.2 (September, 2003): 8.1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editing and publishing ==
The ISE's academic development is overseen by an Editorial Board of 23 members from universities in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. In addition to featuring searchable texts and facsimiles of the folios and quartos, the website is a venue for Shakespeare scholars to publish their fully edited and annotated texts. Existing peer-reviewed publications include: 

* ''As You Like It'', edited by [[David Bevington]];
* ''Cymbeline'', edited by Jennifer Forsyth;
* ''Henry IV, Part One'', edited by Rosemary Gaby;
* ''Julius Caesar'', edited by John D. Cox;
* ''Romeo and Juliet'', edited by Roger Apfelbaum;
* ''The Tempest'', edited by Brent Whitted and Paul Yachnin;
* ''Troilus and Cressida'', edited by William Godshalk and Anthony Colianne; and
* ''Venus and Adonis'', edited by Hardy M. Cook.

Additional modern texts, complete with annotations and collations, have been published but have not yet been peer reviewed.

The ISE also publishes editions of plays written for the [[Queen's Men]], many of which influenced Shakespeare. These plays are prepared for the project [http://qme.internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/ Shakespeare and the Queen's Men], based out of McMaster University and the University of Toronto.

== Theater ==
The Internet Shakespeare Editions' database of Shakespeare in Performance is a searchable archive of information and materials related to performances of Shakespeare's plays. There are thousands of digitized artifacts—images, audio clips, and videos—currently available for public viewing on the site, as well as cast and crew lists for hundreds of films and live performances. The database is overseen by a board of actors, directors, and academics.

In winter 2007, the ISE launched its Performance Chronicle. The Performance Chronicle is a searchable blog-style database of reviews of contemporary Shakespearean productions, written by the general public and scholars. It also includes reviews from scholarly journals, such as ''Cahiers Élizabéthains'', ''Shakespeare Bulletin'', and ''Early Modern Literary Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, Brett D., ''Reviewed and Re-Wired: Video and the Shakespeare Edition.''

The '''Jackson School of Geosciences''' at [[The University of Texas at Austin]] unites the '''Department of Geological Sciences''' with two research units, the '''Institute for Geophysics''' and the '''Bureau of Economic Geology'''.

The Jackson School is both old and new. It traces its origins to a Department of Geology founded in 1888 but became a separate unit at the level of a college only on September 1, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Historical Milestones of the Jackson School http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/about/history/&lt;/ref&gt; The school's formation resulted from gifts by the late John A. and Katherine G. Jackson initially valued at $272 million.&lt;ref&gt;Gifts contributed by oilman John A. Jackson to The University of Texas at Austin total $272 million {{cite web |url=http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/rels/092503.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828024914/http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/rels/092503.html |archivedate=2008-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The school's endowment as of December 31, 2015 is $442.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://utimco.org/scripts/PrivateEndowInfo/collList.asp?comp=10&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Bureau of Economic Geology}}
'''Bureau of Economic Geology'''

The Bureau of Economic Geology was established in 1909 as a successor to the Texas Geological Survey and the Texas Mineral Survey. Dr. William Battle Phillips was the Bureau's first director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beg.utexas.edu/100/db_phillips.htm William Battle Phillips – Bureau of Economic Geology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217191659/http://www.beg.utexas.edu/100/db_phillips.htm |date=2013-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fph09  PHILLIPS, WILLIAM BATTLE | The Handbook of Texas Online | Texas State Historical Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1909 the Texas legislature established and funded three Texas Geological Surveys, which lasted from 1858–1867 (with a four-year suspension), 1873–1876, and 1888–1901 (with the last five years unfunded).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/szg02 GEOLOGICAL SURVEYS OF TEXAS | The Handbook of Texas Online | Texas State Historical Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Today the Bureau functions as a research unit of The University of Texas at Austin, the State Geological Survey, and the Regional Lead Organization for the Petroleum Technology Transfer Council.

[[Image:beg seal transparent.png|125px|right]]

Currently under the leadership of Dr. Scott Tinker,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beg.utexas.edu/Tinker/tinker_about.php Tinker profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113190743/http://www.beg.utexas.edu/Tinker/tinker_about.php |date=2012-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau conducts research in two broad areas: energy and environment.

The Bureau’s energy research focuses largely on oil and natural gas. Major approaches include salt tectonics, carbonate and clastic reservoir characterization, fracture characterization and prediction, multicomponent seismic applications, and basin analysis. The Bureau works to bring insight and innovation from outcrop studies to the evolving science of reservoir characterization. With 70% of in-place reserves typically remaining in the ground at the time of oil field abandonment, this research has enduring economic and societal importance.

The Bureau’s environmental research group conducts a wide range of basic and applied research in groundwater resources, [[vadose zone]] hydrology, coastal studies, near-surface [[geophysics]], and geologic mapping. The group also has programs that relate energy and the environment, including a major initiative in geological sequestration of greenhouse gases. A variety of approaches are used to investigate characteristics and processes of shallow Earth systems and impacts of human activities on those systems. Remote sensing, including satellite (GRACE and MODIS) and airborne geophysics are used to quantify regional scale evapotranspiration, groundwater storage, and saline plume characterization. Subsurface geologic and hydrogeologic characterization provides critical information on sustainability of water resources and potential for [[carbon sequestration]] and desalination. Although many of the studies are focused in Texas, insights and process understanding are applied to other regions globally (such as China, India, Africa, and South America).

The Bureau provides wide-ranging advisory, technical, informational, and research-based services to industries, nonprofit organizations, and Federal, State, and local agencies. The Bureau also provides facilities and management to the office of Publication Sales, Core Research Laboratories, and the Geophysical Log Facility, all of which serve the public.

'''Institute for Geophysics'''

Founded in 1972, the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG) is an Organized Research Unit within The University of Texas at Austin, conducting academic research in geology and geophysics.UTIG works with the UT Department of Geological Sciences and Bureau of Economic Geology to provide basic and applied geophysical research opportunities for graduate students at the MA and PhD level through its worldwide programs in solid earth geophysics, marine geology/geophysics, and multi-channel reflection seismology. Some of its scientists also participate in the university's Environmental Science Institute.

[[Image:UTIG-logo.png|150px|right]]UTIG research activities are carried out all over the world and include large-scale, multi-investigator, multi-institutional field programs. The importance of geophysical measurements and their mathematical interpretation in the exploration for petroleum and economically useful minerals has also led to valuable partnerships between UTIG and industry. UTIG plays a role in K-12 education through formal teacher-training programs and informal outreach efforts.

UTIG strives to conduct research that expands the frontiers of knowledge in earth science, has societal and economic relevance, and is of human interest. Dedicated to basic and applied research alike, the Institute aims to enhance humanity's fundamental understanding of the dynamic geophysical processes that have influenced and continue to influence Earth's structure and climate.

Geographically, UTIG's scope includes the ocean basins, continental margins, Antarctica, and all sites of seismic activity. Chronologically, its scope is no less vast: from the development of tectonic evolution models that reconstruct continental arrangements as much as a billion years ago to predicting how future climatic scenarios would impact sea-level changes and thus the habitability of densely populated coastal regions. The Institute's research is highly relevant to natural resource exploration, the assessment of [[geologic hazards]], and the mitigation of environmental damage. The development of new mathematical models, data processing and imaging techniques, and geophysical instrumentation is also an integral part of UTIG's ongoing research and future goals.

'''Department of Geological Sciences'''

[[Image:University of texas at austin department of geological sciences logo.png|165px|right]]Founded in 1888, the Department of Geological Sciences is the main academic unit of the Jackson School. However, scientists and students in the Department do conduct a wide range of research and collaborate with researchers at the Institute and Bureau, as well as with colleagues around the world.

Scientists in the Department conduct research and teach courses in 9 main areas: Atmospheric Sciences, Computational Geosciences, Geochemistry/Thermo- &amp; Geo-chronology, Geophysics/Seismology, Hydrogeology/Glaciology, Paleontology/Geobiology, Petrology/Mineral Physics, Sedimentary Geology/Stratigraphy, Structural Geology/Lithospheric Geodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson School of Geosciences Research Disciplines
http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/research/disciplines/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department houses one of only a handful of non-medical CT scanners at an academic institution anywhere in the world. The High Resolution X-Ray CT (UTCT) Facility has been used to non-destructivley scan precious, one-of-a-kind specimens such as Lucy (an ancient human ancestor and the world's most famous fossil),&lt;ref&gt;Researchers Complete First CT Scan of Ancient Human Ancestor Lucy http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/2009/02/researchers-complete-first-ct-scan-of-ancient-human-ancestor-lucy/&lt;/ref&gt; ''Archaeopteryx'' (one of the oldest and most primitive birds known), one of the first books printed in the New World, and a meteorite thought by some to contain signs of life on Mars. The UTCT is an NSF-supported shared multi-user facility. Data and imagery from the research are freely available online for scientists,  students and the general public via the DigiMorph web site.&lt;ref&gt;High Resolution X-Ray CT Facility http://www.ctlab.geo.utexas.edu/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DigiMorph http://digimorph.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major lab facilities include: Aqueous Geochemistry, Electron Microbeam (EPMA, SEM, ESEM, and XRD), Fission Track Thermochronology, Geomicrobiology, Geophysics (Landmark and Geoquest software for seismic processing and  interpretation), ICP Mass Spectrometry, Isotope Hydrology, Mineral Physics, Paleomagnetics, Petrographic Imaging, Stable Isotope, [[thermal ionization mass spectrometry|Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry]] (TIMS), and U-PB Geochronology.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Geological Sciences Resources and Facilities http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/research/facilities/&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Department, in partnership with the Texas Natural Science Center, also maintains two major paleontology collections: the Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory (focusing largely on the American Southwest and Texas) and the Non-vertebrate Paleontology Lab.

== Education ==
Jane Bennett originally trained in environmental studies and political science. She then went on to [[Cornell University]] to study environmental science. After Cornell she studied political theory and gained her degree (''[[Latin honors#Types|magna cum laude]]'') in 1979 from [[Siena College]], [[Loudonville, New York]]. Whilst at Siena College Bennett met [[Kathy Ferguson]]. Bennett then went on to the [[University of Massachusetts]] and qualified as a doctor of [[political science]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=Minnesota_Review /&gt;&lt;ref name=CV&gt;{{cite web | title= Jane Bennett | url= http://politicalscience.jhu.edu/bios/jane-bennett/vita%202013%20November.doc | publisher= Department of Political Science, Johns Hopkins University | accessdate= 25 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
Bennett's work considers [[ontology|ontological]] ideas about the [[Speculative realism#Transcendental Materialism / Neo-Vitalism|relationship between humans and 'things']], what she calls "vital materialism",
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"What counts as the material of vital materialism? Is it only human labour and the socio-economic entities made by men using raw materials? Or is materiality more potent than that? How can political theory do a better job of recognizing the active participation of nonhuman forces in every event and every stabilization? Is there a form of theory that can acknowledge a certain ‘thing-power’, that is, the irreducibility of objects to the human meanings or agendas they also embody?"''&lt;ref name="Vital_materialism"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Khan | first = Gulshan | title = Agency, nature and emergent properties: an interview with Jane Bennett | journal = Contemporary Political Theory | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 90–105 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | doi = 10.1057/cpt.2008.43 | date = February 2009 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1057/cpt.2008.43 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Jonah''' or '''Jonas'''{{efn|{{Hebrew Name|יוֹנָה|Yona, Biblically transliterated '''Yonah'''|Yônā|dove}}; {{lang-ar|يونس}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Yūnus, Yūnis}}'' or {{lang|ar|يونان}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Yūnān }}''; [[Latin]]: ''Ionas''}} is the name given in the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Tanakh]]/[[Old Testament]]) to a [[prophet]] of the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|kingdom of Israel]] in about the 8th century [[Common Era|BCE]]. He is the eponymous central figure of the [[Book of Jonah]], in which he is called upon by [[Yahweh|God]] to travel to [[Nineveh]] and warn its residents to repent of their [[sin]]s or face [[Divine retribution|divine wrath]]. Instead, Jonah boards a ship to [[Tarshish#In later history|Tarshish]]. Caught in a storm, he orders the ship's crew to cast him overboard, whereupon he is swallowed by a giant fish. Three days later, after Jonah agrees to go to Nineveh, the fish vomits him out onto the shore. Jonah successfully convinces the entire city of Nineveh to repent, but waits outside the city in expectation of its destruction. God shields Jonah from the sun with a [[kikayon|plant]], but later sends a worm to cause it to wither. When Jonah complains of the bitter heat, God rebukes him.

In [[Judaism]], the story of Jonah represents the teaching of ''[[Repentance in Judaism|teshuva]]'', which is the ability to repent and be forgiven by [[God in Judaism|God]]. In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] calls himself "greater than Jonah" and promises the [[Pharisees]] "the sign of Jonah", which is [[Resurrection of Jesus|his resurrection]]. Early [[Christianity|Christian]] interpreters viewed Jonah as a [[Typology (theology)|type]] for Jesus. Later, during the [[Reformation]], Jonah came to be seen instead as an [[archetype]] for the "envious Jew". Jonah is regarded as a prophet in [[Islam]] and the [[Bible|biblical]] narrative of Jonah is repeated, with a few notable differences, in the [[Quran]]. Mainstream [[Biblical criticism|Bible scholars]] generally regard the Book of Jonah as [[fiction]]al{{sfn|Kripke|1980|page=67}} and often at least partially [[satire|satirical]],{{sfn|Band|2003|pages=105–107}}{{sfn|Ben Zvi|2003|pages=18–19}} but the character of Jonah may have been based on the historical prophet of the same name mentioned in {{bibleverse|2 Kings|14:25|HE}}.

Although the word "whale" is often used in English versions of the Jonah story, the Hebrew text actually uses the phrase  ''dag gadol'', which means "giant fish". In the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the species of the fish that swallowed Jonah was the subject of speculation for [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalists]], who interpreted the story as an account of a historical incident. Some modern scholars of folklore have noted similarities between Jonah and other legendary figures, such as [[Gilgamesh]] and the Greek hero [[Jason]].

==Book of Jonah==
[[File:Pieter Lastman - Jonah and the Whale - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''Jonah and the Whale'' (1621) by [[Pieter Lastman]]]]
Jonah is the central character in the Book of Jonah, in which [[Yahweh|God]] commands him to go to the city of [[Nineveh]] to prophesy against it "for their great wickedness is come up before me,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:2|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Jonah instead attempts to flee from "the presence of the Lord" by going to [[Jaffa]] (sometimes [[transliteration|transliterated]] as ''Joppa'' or ''Joppe''), and sailing to [[Tarshish#In later history|Tarshish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:3|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A huge storm arises and the sailors, realizing that it is no ordinary storm, [[Cleromancy|cast lots]] and discover that Jonah is to blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:4-7|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonah admits this and states that if he is thrown overboard, the storm will cease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:8-12|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sailors refuse to do this and continue rowing, but all their efforts fail and they are eventually forced to throw Jonah overboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:13-15|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the storm calms and the sailors then offer sacrifices to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:15-16|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonah is miraculously saved by being swallowed by a large fish, in whose belly he spends three days and three nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:17|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in the great fish, Jonah prays to God in his affliction and commits to thanksgiving and to paying what he has vowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|2:1-9|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; God then commands the fish to vomit Jonah out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|2:10|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dore jonah.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|''[[Gustave Doré's illustrations for La Grande Bible de Tours|Jonah Preaching to the Ninevites]]'' (1866) by [[Gustave Doré]]]]

God again commands Jonah to travel to Nineveh and prophesy to its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:1-2|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This time he goes and enters the city, crying, "In forty days Nineveh shall be overthrown."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:2-4|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Jonah has walked across Nineveh, the people of Nineveh begin to believe his word and proclaim a fast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:5|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The king of Nineveh puts on sackcloth and sits in ashes, making a proclamation which decrees fasting, the wearing of sackcloth, prayer, and repentance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:6-9|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; God sees their repentant hearts and spares the city at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:10|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire city is humbled and broken with the people (and even the animals)&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:8|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=25}} in sackcloth and ashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Displeased by this, Jonah refers to his earlier flight to Tarshish while asserting that, since God is merciful, it was inevitable that God would turn from the threatened calamities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|4:1-4|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then leaves the city and makes himself a shelter, waiting to see whether or not the city will be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|4:5|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; God causes a plant (in Hebrew a ''[[kikayon]]'') to grow over Jonah's shelter to give him some shade from the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|4:6|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, God causes a worm to bite the plant's root and it withers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|4:7|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonah, now being exposed to the full force of the sun, becomes faint and pleads for God to kill him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|4:8|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|And God said to Jonah: "Art thou greatly angry for the Kikayon?" And he said: "I am greatly angry, even unto death."&lt;br /&gt;And the LORD said: "Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow, which came up in a night, and perished in a night;&lt;br /&gt;and should not I have pity on Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand, and also much cattle?"|Book of Jonah, {{Bibleverse||Jonah|4:9-11|9|chapter 4, verses 9-11}}}}

According to one tradition, Jonah was the boy brought back to life by [[Elijah]] the prophet in {{bibleverse||1 Kings|17|9}}.{{sfn|Green|2005|pages=126–127}} Another tradition holds that he was the son of the [[woman of Shunem]] brought back to life by [[Elisha]] in {{bibleverse|2 Kings|4|9}}{{sfn|Green|2005|page=127}} and that he is called the "son of Amittai" (''Truth'') due to his mother's recognition of Elisha's identity as a prophet in {{bibleverse|2 Kings|17:24|9}}.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=127}} The Book of Jonah is read every year, in its original Hebrew and in its entirety, on [[Yom Kippur]] – the Day of Atonement, as the [[Haftarah]] at the afternoon [[mincha]] prayer.{{sfn|Mirsky|1990|page=354}}{{sfn|Isaacs|2006|page=65}} According to [[Rabbi Eliezer]], the fish that swallowed Jonah was created in the primordial era{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} and the inside of its mouth was like a [[synagogue]];{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} the fish's eyes were like windows{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} and a pearl inside its mouth provided further illumination.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}}

According to the [[Midrash]], while Jonah was inside the fish, it told him that its life was nearly over because soon the [[Leviathan]] would eat them both.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} Jonah promised the fish that he would save them.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} Following Jonah's directions, the fish swam up alongside the Leviathan{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} and Jonah threatened to leash the Leviathan by its tongue and let the other fish eat it.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} The Leviathan heard Jonah's threats, saw that he was [[circumcision|circumcized]], and realized that he was protected by the [[God in Judaism|Lord]],{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} so it fled in terror, leaving Jonah and the fish alive.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} The medieval Jewish scholar and rabbi [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] (1092 – 1167) argued against any literal interpretation of the Book of Jonah,{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=20}} stating that the "experiences of all the prophets except Moses were visions, not actualities."{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=20}} The later scholar [[Isaac Abarbanel]] (1437 – 1509), however, argued that Jonah could have easily survived in the belly of the fish for three days,{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=18}} because "after all, fetuses live nine months without access to fresh air."{{sfn|Gaines|2003|pages=18–19}}

[[Repentance in Judaism|Teshuva]] – the ability to repent and be forgiven by God – is a prominent idea in Jewish thought. This concept is developed in the Book of Jonah: Jonah, the son of truth (the name of his father "Amitai" in Hebrew means truth), refuses to ask the people of [[Nineveh]] to repent. He seeks the truth only, and not forgiveness. When forced to go, his call is heard loud and clear. The people of Nineveh repent ecstatically, "fasting, including the sheep," and the Jewish scripts are critical of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Babylonian Talmud | chapter = Sanhedrin | at = 61a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Jonah also highlights the sometimes unstable relationship between two religious needs: comfort and truth.&lt;ref&gt;Bashevkin, Dovid.

====In the Book of Tobit====
Jonah is mentioned twice in the fourteenth chapter of the [[Deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]] [[Book of Tobit]],{{sfn|Bredin|2006|pages=47–50}} the conclusion of which finds Tobit's son, Tobias, at the extreme age of 127 years, rejoicing at the news of Nineveh's destruction by [[Nebuchadnezzar]] and [[Ahasuerus]] in apparent fulfillment of Jonah's prophecy against the Assyrian capital.{{sfn|Bredin|2006|pages=47–50}}

====In the New Testament====
In the [[New Testament]], Jonah is mentioned in {{bibleverse||Matthew|12:38–41|9}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|16:4|9}} and in {{bibleverse||Luke|11:29–32|9}}.{{sfn|Limburg|1993|page=39}} In the [[Gospel of Matthew]], [[Jesus]] makes a reference to Jonah when he is asked for a sign by some of the scribes and the [[Pharisees]].{{sfn|Stein|1994|page=3}}{{sfn|Sanders|1993|page=167}} Jesus says that the sign will be the [[Typology (theology)#Example of Jonah|sign of Jonah]]:{{sfn|Stein|1994|page=3}}{{sfn|Sanders|1993|page=167}} Jonah's restoration after three days inside the great fish prefigures [[Resurrection of Jesus|His own resurrection]].{{sfn|Stein|1994|page=3}}
{{Quote|&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;He answered, "A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. &lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now something greater than Jonah is here."|Gospel of Matthew, {{Bibleref2-nb|Matthew|12:39–41|NIV}} ([[New International Version]])}}

{{bibleverse||Matthew|12:41-42|9}} and {{bibleverse||Luke|11:31–32|9}} assert in parallel wording that Jesus is greater than Jonah and greater than [[Solomon]].{{sfn|Stein|1994|page=3}}

Jonah is regarded as a saint by a number of [[Christian]] denominations. His feast day in the Roman Catholic Church is on 21 September, according to the ''[[Roman Martyrology|Martyrologium Romanum]]''.&lt;ref name="MR"/&gt; On the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar]], Jonah's feast day is on 22 September (for those churches which follow the traditional [[Julian calendar]]; 22 September currently falls in October on the modern [[Gregorian calendar]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lives of all saints commemorated on September 22 |url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://oca.org/saints/all-lives/2017/09/22+%22Prophet+Jonah%22 |publisher=Orthodox Church in America |date=22 September 2017 |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], moveable feasts are held in commemoration of Jonah as a single prophet and as one of the [[Twelve Minor Prophets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commemoration of the Prophet Jonah |url=http://armenianchurch.ge/en/component/content/article/36-february/80-prophetjonah |publisher=Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Orthodox Holy Church in Georgia |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commemoration of the 12 Minor Prophets |url=http://armenianchurch.ge/en/component/content/article/41-july/127-12minorprophets |publisher=Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Orthodox Holy Church in Georgia |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commemoration Day of the 12 Minor Prophets. 24 July 2018|url=http://ststepanos.org/calendar/commemoration-day-of-the-12-minor-prophets/2018-07-24/ |publisher=Saint Stepanos Armenian Apostolic Church of Elberon in New Jersey |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonah's mission to the Ninevites is commemorated by the [[Fast of Nineveh]] in [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] Churches.&lt;ref name=SycOrth&gt;{{cite web|title=Three day fast of Nineveh |url=http://sor.cua.edu/Feast/NinevehFast.html |publisher=Syriac Orthodox Resources |date=8 February 1998 |accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonah is commemorated as a prophet in the [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod|Missouri Synod of the Lutheran Church]] on 22 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Commemoration of Jonah, Prophet, 22 September |url=https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22Lutheran+Church+Missouri+Synod%22%22The+Commemoration+of+Jonah,+Prophet,+22+September%22 |publisher=Concordia and Koinonia |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian theology|Christian theologians]] have traditionally interpreted Jonah as a [[Typology (theology)|type]] for [[Jesus Christ]].{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=11–20}} Jonah being in swallowed by the giant fish was regarded as a foreshadowing of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus's crucifixion]]{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=11–13}} and the fish vomiting Jonah out onto the beach was seen as a parallel for [[Resurrection of Jesus|Jesus's resurrection]].{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=11–13}} [[Saint Jerome]] equates Jonah with Jesus's more [[nationalism|nationalistic]] side,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=20}} and justifies Jonah's actions by arguing that "Jonah acts thus as a patriot, not so much that he hates the Ninevites, as that he does not want to destroy his own people."{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=20}}

Other Christian interpreters, including [[Saint Augustine]] and [[Martin Luther]], have taken a directly opposite approach,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=23–25}} regarding Jonah as the epitome of envy and jealousness, which they regarded as inherent characteristics of the Jewish people.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=25}} Luther likewise concludes that the ''kikayon'' represents Judaism,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=23–24}} and that the worm which devours it represents Christ.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=24}} Luther also questioned the idea that the Book of Jonah was ever intended as literal history,{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=19}} commenting that he found it hard to believe that anyone would have interpreted it as such if it had never been included in the Bible.{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=19}} Luther's [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] interpretation of Jonah remained the prevailing interpretation among German Protestants throughout early modern history.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=24–26}} [[J. D. Michaelis]] comments that "the meaning of the fable hits you right between the eyes",{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=25}} and concludes that the Book of Jonah is a polemic against "the Israelite people's hate and envy towards all the other nations of the earth."{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=25}} [[Albert Eichhorn]] was a strong supporter of Michaelis's interpretation.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=25–26}}

[[John Calvin]] and [[John Hooper (bishop)|John Hooper]] regarded the Book of Jonah as a warning to all those who might attempt to flee from the wrath of God.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=32–33}} While Luther had been careful to maintain that the Book of Jonah was not written by Jonah,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=33}} Calvin declared that the Book of Jonah was Jonah's personal confession of guilt.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=33}} Calvin sees Jonah's time inside the fish's belly as equivalent to the fires of [[Hell]], intended to correct Jonah and set him on the path of righteousness.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=34–36}} Also unlike Luther, Calvin finds fault with all the characters in the story,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=33}} describing the sailors on the boat as "hard and iron-hearted, like [[Cyclops]]",{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=33}} the penitence of the Ninevites as "untrained",{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=33}} and the king of Nineveh as a "novice".{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=33}} Hooper, on the other hand, sees Jonah as the [[archetype|archetypal]] [[dissident]]{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=39–40}} and the ship he is cast out from as a symbol of the state.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=39–40}} Hooper deplores such dissidents,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=39–40}} decrying: "Can you live quietly with so many Jonasses? Nay then, throw them into the sea!"{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=40}} In the eighteenth century, German professors were forbidden from teaching that the Book of Jonah was anything other than a literal, historical account.{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=19}}

====In the Quran====
'''Jonah''' ([[Arabic]]: يُونُس Yūnus) is the title of the [[tenth chapter of the Quran]]. He is traditionally viewed as highly important in [[Islam]] as a [[Prophets of Islam|prophet]] who was faithful to [[God in Islam|Allah]] and delivered His messages. Jonah is mentioned four times in the [[Quran]]{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=67}} and is the only one of the [[Twelve Minor Prophets]] to be mentioned by name.&lt;ref name="Islam, pg. 348" /&gt; In [[Surah]] 68:48, Jonah is called '''Dhul-Nun''' ([[Arabic]]: '''ذو النون'''; meaning ''The One of the Fish'').{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=67}} In 4:163 and 6:86, he is referred to as "an apostle of Allah".{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=67}} Surah 37:139-148 retells the full story of Jonah:{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=67}}

{{Quote|So also was Jonah among those sent (by Us).&lt;br&gt;When he ran away (like a slave from captivity) to the ship (fully) laden,&lt;br&gt;He (agreed to) cast lots, and he was condemned:&lt;br&gt;Then the big Fish did swallow him, and he had done acts worthy of blame.&lt;br&gt;Had it not been that he (repented and) glorified Allah,&lt;br&gt;He would certainly have remained inside the Fish till the [[Last Judgment|Day of Resurrection]].&lt;br&gt;But We cast him forth on the naked shore in a state of sickness,&lt;br&gt;And We caused to grow, over him, a spreading plant of the gourd kind.&lt;br&gt;And We sent him (on a mission) to a hundred thousand (men) or more.&lt;br&gt;And they believed; so We permitted them to enjoy (their life) for a while.|Quran, chapter 37 ([[As-Saaffat]]), [[ayah|verses]] 139–148&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|37|139|e=148|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Quran never mentions Jonah's father,{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=67}} but [[Muslim]] [[tradition]] teaches that Jonah was from the [[tribe of Benjamin]] and that his father was [[Amittai]].&lt;ref name="Islam, pg. 348"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', ''Yunus'', pg. 348&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonah is also mentioned in a few incidents during the lifetime of [[Muhammad]]. In some instances, Jonah's name is spoken of with praise and reverence by Muhammad. According to historical [[Hadith|narrations about Muhammad's life]], after ten years of receiving revelations, Muhammad went to the city of [[Ta’if]] to see if its leaders would allow him to preach his message from there rather than [[Mecca]], but he was cast from the city by the people. He took shelter in the garden of Utbah and Shaybah, two members of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] tribe. They sent their servant, [[Addas]], to serve him grapes for sustenance. Muhammad asked Addas where he was from and the servant replied Nineveh. "The town of Jonah the just, son of Amittai!" Muhammad exclaimed. Addas was shocked because he knew that the pagan Arabs had no knowledge of the prophet Jonah. He then asked how Muhammad knew of this man. "We are brothers" Muhammad replied. "Jonah was a Prophet of God and I, too, am a Prophet of God." Addas immediately accepted Islam and kissed the hands and feet of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Summarized from ''The Life of the Prophet'' by [[Ibn Hisham]] Volume 1 pp. 419–421&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the sayings of Muhammad, in the collection of [[Imam Bukhari]], says that Muhammad said "One should not say that I am better than Jonah".&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|4|55|608}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wheeler|2002|page=172}}{{sfn|Graham|1977|page=167}}{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}} A similar statement occurs in a hadith written by [[Yazid I|Yunus bin Yazid]], the second [[caliph]] of the [[Umayyad Dynasty]].{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}} Umayya ibn Abi al-Salt, an older contemporary of Muhammad, taught that, had Jonah not prayed to Allah, he would have remained trapped inside the fish until Judgement Day,{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}} but, because of his prayer, Jonah "stayed only a few days within the belly of the fish".{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}}

The ninth-century Persian historian [[Al-Tabari]] records that, while Jonah was inside the fish, "none of his bones or members were injured".{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}} Al-Tabari also writes that Allah made the body of the fish transparent, allowing Jonah to see the "wonders of the deep"{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=74}} and that Jonah heard all the fish singing praises to Allah.{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=74}} [[Kisai Marvazi]], a tenth-century poet, records that Jonah's father was seventy years old when Jonah was born{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}} and that he died soon afterwards,{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}} leaving Jonah's mother with nothing but a wooden spoon, which turned out to be a [[cornucopia]].{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}}

==Scholarly interpretations==
===Historicity===
The consensus of mainstream [[Biblical criticism|Biblical scholars]] holds that the contents of the [[Book of Jonah]] are entirely ahistorical.{{sfn|Ingram|2012|page=140}}{{sfn|Levine|2000|pages=71–72}}{{sfn|Kripke|1980|page=67}} Although the prophet Jonah allegedly lived in the eighth century BCE,{{sfn|Levine|2000|page=71}} the Book of Jonah was written centuries later during the time of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].{{sfn|Levine|2000|page=71}}{{sfn|Ben Zvi|2003|pages=15–16}} The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] used in the Book of Jonah shows strong influences from [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]{{sfn|Levine|2000|page=71}} and the cultural practices described in it match those of the Achaemenid Persians.{{sfn|Levine|2000|page=71}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=25}} Many scholars regard the Book of Jonah as an intentional work of [[parody]] or [[satire]].{{sfn|Band|2003|pages=105–107}}{{sfn|Ben Zvi|2003|pages=18–19}}{{sfn|Ingram|2012|pages=140–142}}{{sfn|McKenzie|Graham|1998|page=113}}{{sfn|Person|1996|page=155}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|pages=22–23}} If this is the case, then it was probably admitted into the canon of the [[Hebrew Bible]] by sages who misunderstood its satirical nature{{sfn|Band|2003|pages=106–107}}{{sfn|Person|1996|page=155}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|pages=22–23}} and mistakenly interpreted it as a serious prophetic work.{{sfn|Band|2003|pages=106–107}}{{sfn|Person|1996|page=155}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|pages=22–23}}

While the Book of Jonah itself is considered fiction,{{sfn|Ingram|2012|page=140}}{{sfn|Levine|2000|pages=71–72}}{{sfn|Kripke|1980|page=67}} Jonah himself may have been a historical prophet;{{sfn|Kripke|1980|pages=67–68}} he is briefly mentioned in the [[Books of Kings|Second Book of Kings]]:{{sfn|Doyle|2005|page=124}}{{sfn|Kripke|1980|page=67}}

Most scholars believe that the anonymous author of the Book of Jonah may have seized upon this obscure prophet from 2 Kings and used him as the basis for the fictional character of Jonah,{{sfn|Doyle|2005|pages=124–125}} but some have contended that the figure of Jonah himself is entirely legendary.{{sfn|Levine|2000|pages=71–72}}

The views expressed by Jonah in the Book of Jonah are a [[parody]] of views held by members of Jewish society at the time when it was written.{{sfn|Ben Zvi|2003|pages=18–19}}{{sfn|Band|2003|page=106}}{{sfn|McKenzie|Graham|1998|page=113}} The primary target of the satire may have been a faction whom [[Morton Smith]] calls "Separationists",{{sfn|Band|2003|page=105}} who believed that God would destroy those who disobeyed him,{{sfn|McKenzie|Graham|1998|page=113}} that sinful cities would be obliterated,{{sfn|McKenzie|Graham|1998|page=113}} and that God's mercy did not extend to those outside the [[Abrahamic covenant]].{{sfn|Band|2003|page=105}} McKenzie and Graham remark that "Jonah is in some ways the most 'orthodox' of Israelite theologians – to make a theological point."{{sfn|McKenzie|Graham|1998|page=113}} Jonah's statements throughout the book are characterized by their militancy,{{sfn|McKenzie|Graham|1998|page=113}}{{sfn|Ingram|2012|page=142}} but his name ironically means "dove",{{sfn|McKenzie|Graham|1998|page=113}}{{sfn|Ingram|2012|page=142}} a bird which the ancient Israelites associated with peace.{{sfn|McKenzie|Graham|1998|page=113}}

Jonah's rejection of God's commands is a parody of the obedience of the prophets described in other Old Testament writings.{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=22}} The king of Nineveh's instant repentance parodies the rulers throughout the other writings of the Old Testament who disregard prophetic warnings, such as [[Ahab]] and [[Zedekiah]].{{sfn|Gaines|2003|pages=22–23}} The readiness to worship God displayed by the sailors on the ship and the people of Nineveh contrasts ironically with Jonah's own reluctance,{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=23}} as does Jonah's greater love for ''kikayon'' providing him shade than for all the people in Nineveh.{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=23}}

The Book of Jonah also employs elements of [[absurdist fiction|literary absurdism]];{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=25}} it exaggerates the size of the city of Nineveh to an implausible degree{{sfn|Levine|2000|page=71}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=25}} and incorrectly refers to the administrator of the city as a "king".{{sfn|Levine|2000|page=71}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=25}} According to scholars, no human being could realistically survive for three days inside a fish,{{sfn|Levine|2000|page=71}} and the description of the livestock in Nineveh fasting alongside their owners is "silly".{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=25}} The motif of a protagonist being swallowed by a giant fish or whale became a stock [[Trope (literature)|trope]] of later satirical writings.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2007|pages=74–81}} Similar incidents are recounted in [[Lucian|Lucian of Samosata]]'s ''[[True History|A True Story]]'', which was written in the second century CE,{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2007|page=76-77}} and in the novel ''[[Baron Munchausen's Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia]]'', published by [[Rudolf Erich Raspe]] in 1785.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2007|pages=77–78}} The story of a man surviving after being swallowed by a whale or giant fish is classified as [[Aarne–Thompson classification systems|ATU]] 1889G.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2007|page=78}}

Though it is often called a whale today, the Hebrew, as throughout scripture, refers to no species in particular, simply saying "great fish" or "big fish" (whales are today classified as [[mammal]]s and not fish, but no such distinction was made in antiquity). While some biblical scholars suggest the size and habits of the [[great white shark]] correspond better to the representations given of Jonah's being swallowed, normally an adult human is too large to be swallowed whole.&lt;ref name="Falwell"&gt;[http://www.liberty.edu/wwwadmin/includes/search/qanda/QandA_Results_elmertowns.cfm?Searched=&amp;AID=274&amp;DisplayResults=1 Theological Topic Search] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230239/http://www.liberty.edu/wwwadmin/includes/search/qanda/QandA_Results_elmertowns.cfm?Searched=&amp;AID=274&amp;DisplayResults=1 |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of [[whaling]] from the 18th century onwards made it clear that most, if not all, species of whale were incapable of swallowing a man, leading to much controversy about the veracity of the biblical story of Jonah.&lt;ref name="Kemp1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kemp|first=Peter Kemp|title=The Oxford Companion to Ships &amp; the Sea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VmnPwAACAAJ|year=1979|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-586-08308-6|page=434|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217011744/https://books.google.com/books?id=8VmnPwAACAAJ|archivedate=2017-02-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point ''cetus'' became synonymous with "whale" (the study of whales is now called ''[[cetology]]''). In his 1534 translation, [[William Tyndale]] translated the phrase in Jonah 2:1 as "greate fyshe" and the word ''kétos'' (Greek) or ''cetus'' (Latin) in {{bibleverse||Matthew|12:40|9}} as "whale". Tyndale's translation was later incorporated into the [[King James Version|Authorized Version]] of 1611. Since then, the "great fish" in Jonah 2 has been most often interpreted as a whale. In English some translations use the word "whale" for Matthew 12:40, while others use "sea creature" or "big fish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=How Did God Do It?

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalists]], interpreting the Jonah story as a historical account, became obsessed with trying to identify the exact species of the fish that swallowed Jonah.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=42–45}} In the mid-nineteenth century, [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]], professor of Hebrew at [[Oxford University]], claimed that the Book of Jonah must have been authored by Jonah himself{{sfn|Green|2011|page=48}} and argued that the fish story must be historically true, or else it would not have been included in the Bible.{{sfn|Green|2011|page=48}} Pusey attempted to scientifically catalogue the fish,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=47–48}} hoping to "shame those who speak of the miracle of Jonah's preservation in the fish as a thing less credible than any of God's other miraculous doings".{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=48}}

The debate over the fish in the Book of Jonah played a major role during [[Clarence Darrow]]'s cross-examination of [[William Jennings Bryan]] at the [[Scopes Trial]] in 1925.{{sfn|Smolla|1997}}{{sfn|Lidz|2016}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=19}} Darrow asked Bryan "When you read that... the whale swallowed Jonah... how do you literally interpret that?"{{sfn|Smolla|1997}} Bryan replied that "a God who can make a whale and can make a man and make both of them do what He pleases."{{sfn|Smolla|1997}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=19}} Bryan ultimately admitted that it was necessary to interpret the Bible,{{sfn|Smolla|1997}} and is generally regarded as having come off looking like a "buffoon".{{sfn|Lidz|2016}}

The largest whales—[[baleen whale]]s, a group which includes the [[blue whale]]—eat [[plankton]] and "it is commonly said that this species would be choked if it attempted to swallow a herring."&lt;ref&gt;Lydekker's New Natural History, Vol, III, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  As for the [[whale shark]], Dr. E. W. Gudger, an Honorary Associate in [[Ichthyology]] at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], notes that, while the whale shark does have a large mouth,{{sfn|Gudger|1940|page=227}} its throat is only four inches wide, with a sharp elbow or bend behind the opening,{{sfn|Gudger|1940|page=227}} meaning that not even a human arm would be able to pass through it.{{sfn|Gudger|1940|page=227}} He concludes that "the whale shark is not the fish that swallowed Jonah."{{sfn|Gudger|1940|page=227}}

==Suggested connections to legends==
[[File:Chapiteau Mozac Jonas 1.JPG|thumb|Jonah being swallowed by a great toothed sea-monster. Sculpted column capital from the nave of the abbey-church in [[Mozac]], France, 12th century.]]
[[Joseph Campbell]] suggests that the story of Jonah parallels a scene from the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', in which [[Gilgamesh]] obtains a plant from the bottom of the sea.{{sfn|Campbell|1988|pages=90–95}} In the Book of Jonah, a [[worm]] (in Hebrew ''tola'ath'', "maggot") bites the shade-giving plant's root causing it to wither;{{sfn|Campbell|1988|pages=90–95}} whereas in the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'', Gilgamesh ties stones to his feet and plucks his plant from the floor of the sea.{{sfn|Campbell|1988|pages=90–95}}{{sfn|Dalley|1989|pages=118–119}} Once he returns to the shore, the rejuvenating plant is eaten by a serpent.{{sfn|Campbell|1988|pages=90–95}}{{sfn|Dalley|1989|page=119}}

Campbell also noted several similarities between the story of Jonah and that of [[Jason]] in Greek mythology.{{sfn|Campbell|1988|pages=90–95}} The Greek rendering of the name Jonah is ''Jonas'', which differs from ''Jason'' only in the order of sounds—both ''o''s are [[omega]]s suggesting that Jason may have been confused with Jonah.{{sfn|Campbell|1988|pages=90–95}} Gildas Hamel, drawing on the Book of Jonah and [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] sources—including [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]] and the accounts of [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus]] and [[Argonautica|Orphic Argonautica]]—identifies a number of shared motifs, including the names of the heroes, the presence of a dove, the idea of "fleeing" like the wind and causing a storm, the attitude of the sailors, the presence of a sea-monster or dragon threatening the hero or swallowing him, and the form and the word used for the "gourd" (kikayon).{{sfn|Hamel|2015|pages=1–20}} Hamel takes the view that it was the Hebrew author who reacted to and adapted this mythological material to communicate his own, quite different message.{{sfn|Hamel|2015|pages=18–20}}

The '''Kunsthalle Bremen''' is an art museum in [[Bremen]], [[Germany]]. It is located close to the Bremen Old Town on the "Culture Mile" ({{lang-de|Kulturmeile}}). The [[Kunsthalle]] was built in 1849, enlarged in 1902 by architect Eduard Gildemeister, and expanded several more times, most notably in 2011. Since 1977, the building has been designated a [[Kulturdenkmal]] on Germany's buildings heritage list.&lt;ref name = denkmal&gt;{{WP-HB LfD|0084|Database of Landesamt für Denkmalpflege Bremen #0084}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum houses a collection of European paintings from the 14th century to the present day, sculptures from the 16th to 21st centuries and a New Media collection. Among its highlights are French and German paintings from the 19th and 20th century, including important works by [[Claude Monet]], [[Édouard Manet]] and [[Paul Cézanne]], along with major paintings by [[Lovis Corinth]], [[Max Liebermann]], [[Max Beckmann]] and [[Paula Modersohn-Becker]]. The New Media section features works by [[John Cage]], [[Otto Piene]], [[Peter Campus]], [[Olafur Eliasson]], and [[Nam June Paik]]. The Department of Prints and Drawings has 220,000 sheets from the 15th to 20th centuries, one of largest collections of its kind in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Kunsthalle Bremen at: [http://www.euromuse.net/en/museums/museum/view-m/kunsthalle-bremen/ Euromuse.net - the exhibition portal for Europe] {{en icon}} retrieved 2 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kunsthalle Bremen is operated by the non-profit Bremen Art Society ({{lang-de|Kunstverein Bremen}}), making it the only German museum with an extensive art collection from the 14th to 21st centuries which is still in private ownership.&lt;ref name="noble9"&gt;[[Wulf Herzogenrath]], Ingmar Laehnemann: ''Noble Gäste. 200 Meisterwerke der Kunsthalle Bremen zu Gast in 22 deutschen Museen'' (Bremen: Hachmannedition, 2009) {{ISBN|978-3939429586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== History of the Art Society ===
In 1823, a group of 34 businessmen interested in art founded an Art Society ({{lang-de|Kunstverein}}) in [[Bremen]] with the aim of "spreading a sense of beauty and form." It is one of the oldest such societies in Germany. The first years of the association's activities were focused on private art exhibitions, with the acquisition of works backed financially from ticket proceeds and business donations. Ten years after its founding, the Society owned 13 paintings, 585 drawings and 3917 leaf prints. The majority of the paintings were Old Masters, including the famous Madonna of Masolino and a series of paintings of Dutch painters of the 17th Century, such as [[Jan van Goyen]] and [[Pieter Wouwerman]].  After 1843, large public exhibitions were organized in association with similar associations in [[Hannover]], [[Lübeck]], [[Greifswald]], [[Rostock]] and [[Stuttgart]]. By 1846 the society had grown to 575 members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kunsthalle-bremen.de/kunsthalle/ueber-uns/geschichte/die-anfaenge-1823-1847/ Geschicht: Die Anfänge (1823-1847)] at Kunstverein Bremen {{icon de}} retrieved 1 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manya Ocken: ''The Kunstverein in Bremen in the 19th Century'' (University of Bonn, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; The Kunstverein Bremen is still the exclusive owner of the Kunsthalle Bremen and today has over 8000 members. The society is funded from foundations, private donations, bequests, and grants from the city of Bremen.&lt;ref&gt;Kunstverein Bremen: [https://web.archive.org/web/20111006185106/http://www.kunsthalle-bremen.de/kunstverein/ueber-uns-kv/ About Us] {{icon de}} retrieved 1 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History of the Kunsthalle ===

==== The building of 1849 ====
[[File:Kunsthalle Bremen - J. Bremermann - 1849.jpg|thumb|The Kunsthalle Bremen in 1849]]
Supported by numerous foundations and patrons, the Art Society put out a competitive bid for a new museum building. A then very young Lueder Rutenberg - himself a member of the Art Association - won against prominent competitors. The Society broke ground on the Kunsthalle on 1 July 1847, becoming the first Society in Germany with its own building. The construction project was located on a former rubbish dump in the vicinity of the old city ramparts and the building was finished in 1849. Rutenberg's design was of a dignified but understated two-story building with a three-axis central projection of round arches.&lt;ref name = denkmal/&gt; While the collections were largely owned by the Kunstverein, the property itself was owned by the city. Four stone figures over the entrance are of [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Dürer]], and [[Rubens]], created by the sculptor Adolph Steinhäuser (1825-1858).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kunsthalle-bremen.de/kunsthalle/ueber-uns/geschichte/die-anfaenge-1823-1847/ Geschicht: Der Bau der Kunsthalle (1847-1849)] at the Kunstverein Bremen {{icon de}} retrieved 1 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Expansion in 1902 ====
[[File:Kunsthalle Bremen Treppenhaus.jpg|thumb|The Kunsthalle's new central hall in 1902, destroyed in World War II]]
After another competition among Bremen architects, a much-needed enlargement was commissioned in 1898. Albert Dunkel was selected to design the interiors, Eduard Gildemeister for the monumental sandstone facade, and decoration by renowned sculptors Georg Roemer and [[Georg Wrba]]. The foundation work was begun in 1899 and on 15 February 1902 the opening ceremony took place. The facade was under construction until 1904. The expansion was funded by foundations and businessmen in Bremen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kunsthalle-bremen.de/kunsthalle/ueber-uns/geschichte/der-erweiterungsbau-der-kunsthalle-1899-1902/ Geschichte: Der Erweiterungsbau der Kunsthalle (1899-1902))] at the Kunstverein Bremen {{icon de}} retrieved 1 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Consequences of World War II ====
[[File:Übergang Washingtons über den Delaware.jpg|thumb|The original ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'' (1849–50) by [[Emanuel Leutze]] was destroyed in an air raid on 5 September 1942]]
The art gallery was closed shortly after the outbreak of war and the collection was initially stored in the basement. In the night of 5 September 1942, a fire bomb destroyed the central staircase and six rooms upstairs. It also burned the painting ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'' by [[Emanuel Leutze]], which because of its size could not be removed. Today a second version hangs in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref name = kunsthalle&gt;Kunsthalle Bremen: ''Geschichte 1914-1945'' [http://www.kunsthalle-bremen.de/kunsthalle/ueber-uns/geschichte/emil-waldmann-1914-1945/ online] {{icon de}} retrieved 3 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

After this damage, large parts of the collection were moved to protected areas underneath the Bremer Landesbank and Norddeutschen Kreditbank. As the severity of air raids on Bremen increased, Mayor Böhmcker finally decreed that the collection should be housed outside the city in safety. The removal of the artworks began in 1943 to four different places: the paintings, drawings and graphic sheets were divided between Karnzow Castle of Count Konigsmark in [[Kyritz]], Schloss Neumühle of Count von der Schulenburg in [[Salzwedel]], and Schwöbber Castle  near [[Hameln]]. The sculptures were taken to the royal crypt at Bückeburg Castle.&lt;ref name="kunsthalle"/&gt;

Karnzow Castle was located in [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] closer to [[Berlin]] and it held 50 paintings, 1715 drawings and about 3000 prints from the collection. The castle was taken in May 1945 by Soviet troops and on their return home it was plundered. The Soviets also left the hiding place open, with the result that works of art were within the reach of everyone. Berlin sculptor Kurt Reutti, head of a unit of the Berlin City Council, was able to find several items by extensive research and reclamation from the local black market. However, the losses of the Kunsthalle Bremen stand alongside those of the [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]] and the Dresden art collections as the largest and most devastating of any German museum from the war. In all over 1,500 works from the Kunsthalle remain missing today.&lt;ref name = akinsha&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1017/S0940739110000111|title=Why Can't Private Art "Trophies" Go Home from the War?|last1=Akinsha|first1=Konstantin|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|volume=17|issue=27|pages=257–290 |date= 17 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reconstruction after 1945 ====
In the immediate postwar period, the conditions of the Museum and the activities of the Art Society were extremely difficult. Between 1947 and 1948, soldiers of the US Army were billeted in the art gallery, Print Room and Board Room. Because of war damage the building was unusable for displaying art, although exhibitions were organized at other locations starting in 1946. In 1948, ten rooms upstairs were again opened to the public for the 125th anniversary of the Art Society. After further repairs, all rooms on the upper floor were usable again by the end of 1951. In 1961 an extensive restoration was carried out which repaired the heavy war damage. The staircase and the front entrance were modernized in the style of the time.

==== Expansion in 1982 ====
An extension to the building was completed in 1982 by architect Werner Düttmann and caused a scandal. Contrary to the plans which had been approved in sandstone red brick facade was built instead.

==== Renovations 1990-1999 ====
In 1990 the Art Society secured financing for the renovation of the workshops, storage areas and the main Print Room of the now structurally and functionally obsolete building. Between 1996 and 1998, more renovations of the Art Gallery continued under the chairman Georg Abegg and director [[Wulf Herzogenrath]]. These were urgent because the exhibition halls were in poor condition, the lighting did not meet the requirements and climate conditions did not meet international standards.

In 1995 the Art Society's board of trustees began a "Save the Art Gallery" capital campaign under the leadership of the merchant and deputy chairman Dieter Harald Berghöfer, which reached out to patrons. Within one year it had received 7 million marks, a third of the calculated construction costs (in a city with fewer than 600,000 inhabitants).&lt;ref name=NYT1998&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Galloway | date=30 May 1998 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/30/style/30iht-bremen.t.html | title=City Has Rejuvenated the Focke and Kunsthalle: Bremen Brushes Up Its Museums | newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state of Bremen and the Federal Republic then provided the other two thirds. Due to unexpected difficulties with the building, construction costs rose to almost 25 million DM, and these additional costs were raised solely by donors who wanted to support the efforts of the Art Society and the Board of Trustees.

As a result of the renovation, golden oak parquet replaced the linoleum, while the 24 halls and intimate cabinets in which the permanent collection is grouped are bathed in color.&lt;ref name=NYT1998 /&gt;

====Extension 2011====
Between 2009 and 2011, the older constructions of 1961 and 1982 were demolished and two modernist, cubic wings with 5560 square meters of gross floor area were added to the old main building according to the plans by architects Hufnagel, Putz and Rafaelian. The main building with 7410 square meters of gross floor area was completely renovated and portions modernized. The project cost around €30 million. The families of Friedrich and Peter Lürssen shipyard and Lürßen from the Karin and Uwe Hollweg Foundation contributed a third, and the city of Bremen and the Federal Government each one-third of these costs. Additional costs of €3.5 million for geothermal heating. The new Art Gallery opened on 20 August 2011 and held its first major exhibition at the on 15 October 2011.

=== Baldin Collection ===
{{Main article|Baldin Collection}}
In 1945 Soviet Army officer Viktor Baldin discovered the stored works from the Kunsthalle in the basement of Karnzow Castle. In order to protect them from complete destruction, he grabbed drawings by [[Rembrandt]], [[Titian]], [[Rubens]], [[Goya]], [[Van Gogh]] and [[Édouard Manet]] and brought them to the [[Soviet Union]] in a suitcase. In 1963 Baldin became Director of the Moscow Architecture Museum. In the autumn of 1989 he visited the Bremen Kunsthalle and reported to the chairman of the Art Society that he had the time to get two paintings and 362 drawings out of Castle Karnzow and had handed them over to the Schtschusev State Research and Science Museum for safekeeping. In the following years he tried repeatedly to return the artwork to the Bremen Art Society by appealing to the highest authorities of the [[USSR]], but without success. The whole issue of "[[looted art]]" from Germany was still taboo at that time. In 1995, a show named after him was held in the Hermitage collection in St. Petersburg. In February 2003, the then Russian Minister of Culture, after a formal request of the Kunstverein in 2000, provided a written commitment that the Baldin Collection should be returned to Bremen. Although the collection is not covered by the Plundered Art Laws, the Russian State Duma has so far refused to return it.

'''Langa Education Assistance Program (LEAP)''', also known as '''LEAP Science and Maths Schools''', is a collection of six non-fee payment secondary education schools located in three provinces in [[South Africa]]. The first LEAP school opened in 2004 in rented premises in Observatory, [[Cape Town]] and served mainly, learners from the [[township]] of [[Langa, Cape Town|Langa]].&lt;ref name="History of LEAP"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://leapschool.org.za/history-of-leap/|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20141110010101/http://leapschool.org.za/history%2Dof%2Dleap/|title = History of LEAP|accessdate = 10 November 2014|archivedate=10 November 2014|dead-url = yes|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As an independent school, LEAP is mainly founded by South African Corporates with limited subsidies from the [[South African Department of Education|Department of Basic Education]].

==History==

===Langa Education Assistance Program (or LEAP) ===

John Gilmour was a teacher at [[Pinelands High School]]&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt; in Cape Town in 1987 when he decided to respond to a call from individuals within the South African business community, to contribute to the redress of the devastation of the [[Bantu Education Act]],&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt; a segregation law imposed in the education sector by the [[Apartheid]] system in 1953.

“Africa Week” was then introduced by a team led by John Gilmour to bring black learners under the “Bantu Education” system to spend a week at Pinelands High School, which was then a white’s only school. The program became the precursor for the Langa Education Assistance Program (or LEAP) which aimed at providing one hundred black students from the Langa township, with support tuition from Pinelands High teachers in [[English language|English]], [[Maths]] and [[Science]], three afternoons a week.

The prohibitive transport cost of bringing learners from the township schools to Pinelands High School forced the model to be revised. In 1996, it was then decided that instead of learners being bussed in to Pinelands High, teachers will be transported to meet learners in township schools.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt;

Community members in Langa perceived the new model of LEAP as an attempt of white teachers to “save” black children. Teachers from the community felt that they were as able as other teachers to provide extra lessons that would address the inadequacies in the students' educational foundations.  The uneasiness within the community obliged the leadership of LEAP to change the model and include community teachers in the program.

When John Gilmour realised that despite best efforts of LEAP and similar programs in the country there was no increase in the proportion of black learners entering university, especially science-based disciplines, he sought for an alternative model. LEAP Science and Maths school was the alternative model.

===LEAP Science and Maths School===

LEAP Science and Maths school was a deliberate decision of John Gilmour seeking to increase the number of black learners who take science and maths-based modules at high school in order to increase the chance of being accepted at University, particular in disciplines where these modules are a prerequisite.&lt;ref name="A Leap in the dark"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Terblanche|first1=Barry|title=A leap in the dark|publisher=Mail and Guardian|date=19 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John resigned as Headmaster of Abbot’s College in 2004, where he has been since he left Pinelands in 1997, to focus on LEAP Science and Maths School.  In January 2004, the first LEAP Science and Maths School opened its doors in the suburb of Observatory, Cape Town, with seventy-two learners, seven teachers and one administrative staff member.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt;

===Expansion of the LEAP model===

====LEAP 1====

The LEAP Science and Maths school, which started in Observatory later moved to Pinelands and become known as LEAP 1. It serves learners from community of Langa Township. It is the first and oldest of the LEAP Science and Maths schools.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt; The school is headed by its Operation Leader Oscar Dlodlo.

====LEAP 2====

LEAP 2 opened in 2007 also in Pinelands. It serves learners from the townships of Gugulethu and Crossroads. In 2013, the school opened satellite classes to serve grade 9 and 10 learners from the township of Delft. Learners of the school are taught in English and [[isiXhosa]]. The head of the school is Mr. Babele Emedi, who also assumes the role of Operations Leader.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt;

====LEAP 3====

The school opened its doors in 2008 to serve learners from the township of Alexandra in [[Johannesburg]].  Learners are taught in [[English language|English]], [[isiZulu]], [[Sepedi]] and [[Sesotho]] under the leadership of the Operations leader, Mr. Mark Fletcher.&lt;ref name="History of LEAP" /&gt;

====LEAP 4====

This school is situated in the township of [[Diepsloot]] just outside Johannesburg. The school opened in 2011 through a partnership with the South Africa corporate Aveng Group.&lt;ref name="Aveng Group Projects"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aveng Group Projects|url=http://www.aveng.co.za/csi-trust/projects/leap-science-and-maths-school|website=http://www.aveng.co.za/csi-trust/projects/leap-science-and-maths-school|publisher=Aveng Group|accessdate=10 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003105051/http://www.aveng.co.za/csi-trust/projects/leap-science-and-maths-school|archivedate=3 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; LEAP 4 teaches learners in isiZulu and [[Sepedi]] as home languages, along with English.  Paul Mumba, is the Operations Leader and head of LEAP 4.

====LEAP 5====

In 2012, LEAP 5 opened its doors in Jane Furse, [[Sekhukhune District Municipality|Sekhukhune]] in [[Limpopo]] province. The school is under the leadership of its Operation Leader, Raphael Mukachi.

====LEAP 6====

LEAP 6 is situated in [[Ga-Rankuwa]] near [[Pretoria]]. The school opened in 2012 to respond to the request of the Anglican Diocese of Pretoria, concerned with the community’s poor educational results and high unemployment rate, particularly among young people. The school is led by its Operation Leader, Lawrence Manyesa.

==Vision==

“We strive for the positive transformation of communities through the meaningful education of children from those communities”&lt;ref name="About LEAP"&gt;{{cite web|title=About LEAP|url=http://leapschool.org.za/aboutleap/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/aboutleap/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

“LEAP schools provide student-centered, math’s and science-focused education to economically disadvantaged students from grades 8 to 12. We focus on enabling the self-awareness necessary for each student’s growth to healthy adulthood, and to ensuring optimal academic results which will allow for choices for lifelong learning and a fulfilling future.”&lt;ref name= "About LEAP" /&gt;

== Values and focus==

Although LEAP schools focus on Maths and Sciences; it puts a lot of emphasis on the emotional [[child development|development]] of learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dugger|first1=Celia W|title=New Schools in South Africa Serve the Underserved|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/world/africa/09safrica.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=3&amp;|accessdate=10 November 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=8 September 2010|ref=New Schools in South Africa Serve the Underserved}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Gilmour acknowledged the importance of the emotional development in a country where “eight million children come from single-parent households and a further 4.3 million reside with neither biological parent”.  In his article “A tale of two systems”, he speaks of LEAP’s response to this problem “has been to recognise that social transformation starts with personal transformation:  one person at a time, one room at a time, one school at a time and one community at a time.”&lt;ref name="A tale of two systems"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gilmour|first1=John|title=A tale of two systems|url=http://leapschool.org.za/2012/02/12/a-tail-of-two-systems/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school cherishes the following values:
*Being kind, honest and healthy
*Being punctual and looking good
*Working hard and never giving up
*Admitting and learning from mistakes
*Confronting issues and being open to change
*Working together and sharing

== Success stories==

===Statistics===

In a report that analyses the performance of the school between 2005 and 2013, LEAP reported that:

*Its grade 12 learners have achieved a 93% pass rate within the reporting period.
*600 learners passed the National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations commonly known as “matric”
*77% qualified for study at academic and technical universities with a bachelor or diploma pass.&lt;ref name=Success&gt;{{cite web|title=Success|url=http://leapschool.org.za/success/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/success/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school claims to outperform national statistics when it compares itself with national averages of learners who write maths and science in 2013. All LEAP learners wrote these modules compared to only 43% who took maths and 33% who took physical science nationally.&lt;ref name="LEAP Annual Report 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=LEAP Annual Report 2013|url=http://leapschool.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/LEAP_AnnualReport2013.pdf|website=http://leapschool.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/LEAP_AnnualReport2013.pdf|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graduates===

Bonisanani Mtshekisa&lt;ref name="Never Give Up"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mtshekisa|first1=Bonisanani|title=Never Give Up|url=http://leapschool.org.za/2011/08/08/never-give-up/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/2011/08/08/never-give-up/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is LEAP’s first university graduate. He graduated with a bachelor in [[Bachelor of Commerce]] in Finance from the [[University of the Western Cape]]. In its 2012 annual report, the school reported to have over 30 university graduates ranging from physiotherapist, engineer to accountants.

===Celebratory adverts===

In 2014, LEAP launched a series of celebratory adverts to showcase its work and celebrate the achievements of its past students. Qondisa Nxganga, a Master’s graduate from the prestigious [[African Institute for Mathematical Sciences]] (AIMS), is featured in these adverts alongside a number of other LEAP alumni.&lt;ref name="Celebrating LEAP Alumni"&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrating LEAP Alumni|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPYGiXxlQCo|website=www.youtube.com|publisher=LEAP Science &amp; Maths School|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnerships===

LEAP’s model is based on strong engagement with the broader community and building beneficial partnerships and collaboration with other organizations, particular schools. It is a three-way collaboration approach where each LEAP school partners with a more privileged school as well as a less privileged school (a township school) in the community where it operates to promote a culture of shared resources and cultural exchange&lt;ref name=Schools&gt;{{cite web|title=Schools|url=http://leapschool.org.za/schools/|website=http://leapschool.org.za/schools/|publisher=LEAP Science and Maths Schools|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LEAP has also been successful in building strong partnerships with both commercial and non-profit organizations. Most of its funding comes from South African corporates, trusts and Foundations.

LEAP, is Teach with Africa’s partner on the continent and together they have established the Teacher Institute which seeks to develop teachers and supports individuals wanting to enter the teaching profession&lt;ref name="Teach for Africa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Teach for Africa|url=http://www.teachwithafrica.org/what-we-do/our-in-country-partners/|website=http://www.teachwithafrica.org/what-we-do/our-in-country-partners/|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6977">'''Levels of edit''' (or '''levels of editing''') describes a cumulative or categorical scheme for revising text. Beginning as a tool that helped standardize communication between writers and editors at a government laboratory, published information about levels of edit was later made available to the general public. Subsequently, others developed a variety of levels of edit, which are now accessible through print and web-based resources.

== History ==
Van Buren and Buehler of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) developed five levels of edit defined by nine editorial categories.
# Coordination: Consider version and circulation, Consider the review cycles
# Policy: Consider the organizational structure
# Integrity: Are sources noted? 
# Screening: Consider spelling. Are visuals/art presented with clarity?
# Copy clarification: Are images legible? Are images trimmed?
# Format: What are the layout conventions?  What are the typographical conventions?
# Mechanical style: Check spelling and usage.
# Language: Make edits for clarity and concision.
# Substantive
In 1976, JPL first published Van Buren and Buehler's work as The Levels of Edit.&lt;ref name=buren1980&gt;Van Buren, R., and M .F. Buehler. 1980. ''The Levels of Edit'', Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Pasadena: California Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt; JPL published a second edition in 1980, and the [[US Government Printing Office|United States Government Printing Office]] (GPO) sold copies of the book to the general public. After the GPO’s supply of the second edition was depleted, the [[Society for Technical Communication]] (STC) made available a facsimile reprint of the second edition.

Drawing on Van Buren and Buehler’s work, in 1985 the writing and editing group at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] established four levels of edit for technical reports. A team at the laboratory revised the work following a 1994 survey that indicated the original four levels no longer met authors’ needs. The Los Alamos revision presented three “author-based” levels of edit (proofreading edit, grammar edit, and full edit) whose goals were to “simplify the editing process, focus editing on improving technical clarity, and ensure that value was added in editing.”&lt;ref name=prono1998&gt;Prono, J., DeLanoy, M., Deupree, R., Skiby, J., and B. Thompson. 1998. “Developing New Levels of Edit,” Los Alamos, NM: Los Alamos National Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Rude reduced the levels to just two types: 1) comprehensive editing and 2) copyediting.&lt;ref name=rude2006&gt;Rude, C. D. 2006. ''Technical Editing'' (4th ed.), New York: Pearson Longman.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several chapters in New Perspectives on Technical Editing, edited by Avon J. Murphy,&lt;ref name=murphy2010&gt;Murphy, A.J. (Ed.) 2010. ''New Perspectives on Technical Editing'', Amityville, New York: Baywood Publishing Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; include discussions of the different types of edits.

Other researchers built schemes based on editing rules, tasks, and analyses. For example, Tarutz defined a hierarchy of levels&lt;ref name=tarutz1992&gt;Tarutz, J. 1992. ''Technical Editing: The Practical Guide for Editors and Writers''. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; that Corbin and Oestreich referred to in their presentation at the 2011 STC Summit&lt;ref name=corbin2011&gt;Corbin, M. and L. Oestreich. 2011. “Editing: Reviewing Levels and Choosing Types.” Presented at the 58th annual conference of the Society for Technical Communication, Technical Communication Summit, Sacramento, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; as “informal,” as follows.

# Turning pages (a superficial look of the text)
# Skimming (correcting obvious errors of spelling, grammar, and punctuation)
# Skimming and comparing (seeking internal consistency, including cross-references)
# Reading (improving writing style, such as wording and usage)
# Analyzing (identifying and fixing organizational flaws, missing information, redundancy, and technical inconsistency)
# Testing and using (fixing technical errors and resolving usability problems)


To bring a quality assurance perspective to technical editing, Corbin and others mapped types of edit to types of testing, for example, “system testing to comprehensive editing” and “function testing to copyediting” (p.&amp;nbsp;290).&lt;ref name=corbin2002&gt;Corbin, M., Moell, P., and M. Boyd. 2002. “Technical Editing As Quality Assurance: Adding Value to Content.” ''Technical Communication'', 49 (3): 286-300.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other variations ==
As web-based on-demand proofreading and editing services have become increasingly available, the number of edit levels and editing schemes has increased in variety. For example, three cumulative levels is a common scheme, typically 1) light, 2) medium, and 3) heavy editing, although another three-level scheme appears frequently across websites: 1) proofreading and 2) light and 3) heavy editing. Four levels usually differs from a three-level scheme only by the inclusion of a mid-range level, such as 1) basic proofreading and 2) light, 3) medium, and 4) heavy editing.&lt;ref name=dr2010&gt;dr. edit®. 2010-2011. Online: [http://www.dr-edit.com www.dr-edit.com]. Irvine, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; No matter the scheme, a level of edit defined as heavy often results in a complete rewrite. And one web-based service offers six levels of edit according to a partially cumulative scheme:
# Basic proofreading
# Complete editing without comments
# Complete editing with comments
# Manuscript critique
# Formatting and layout
# Verification of citation sources.&lt;ref name=lombardino2008&gt;David Lombardino &amp; Associates. 2008-2011. Online: [http://www.the-draft-editor.com www.the-draft-editor.com].&lt;/ref&gt;
Based on the function of the edit and the working unit to which it applies, eight levels of edit are also presented, as follows.
# Developmental outline: Technical document
# Technical: Document
# Style: Document
# Literary: Paragraph
# Copy: Sentence
# Format: Character
# Production: Character
# Review: Document&lt;ref name=communications2003&gt;KTD Communications. 2003. Online: [http://www.ktdcommunications.com/terminology/levelsofedit.htm www.ktdcommunications.com/terminology/levelsofedit.htm]. Phoenix, AZ.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==

MEST was announced in 2007, when [[Meltwater Group|Meltwater]] announced plans to establish an entrepreneurial training program in Africa. The school opened in February 2008 with the first class of Entrepreneurs in Training (EITs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconafrica.com/meltwater-incubator-a-year-in-review/|title=A Year in Review at Meltwater Incubator in Accra - Ghana|publisher=Silicon Africa|first=Monica|last=Jamaluddin|date=23 January 2013|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, the first class of EITs graduated and the MEST [[Business incubator|Incubator]] was launched with [[seed funding]] for incubator companies started by the first group of EITs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/14/out-of-africa-a-whole-mest-of-startups-emerges-in-ghana/|title=Out of Africa - A Whole MEST of Startups Emerges in Ghana|publisher=TechCrunch|first=Mike|last=Butcher|date=14 June 2012|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, MEST partnered with [[Vodafone Ghana]] to sponsor a 48-hour hackathon to help develop access to information, simplify transactions and shorten business processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disrupt-africa.com/2015/01/mest-partners-vodafone-ghana-hackathon/|title=MEST Partners Vodafone Ghana for Hackathon|first=Tom|last=Jackson|date=28 January 2015 |access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghananewsagency.org/social/vodafone-mest-hackathon-app-developer-competition-finalised--101941|title=Vodafone, MEST Hackathon App Developer Competition Finalised|publisher=Ghana News Agency|date= 24 March 2016|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, the school was recognized as one of the top 10 most innovative companies of Africa by [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]].&lt;ref name=fast&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3041821/most-innovative-companies-2015/the-worlds-top-10-most-innovative-companies-of-2015-in-africa|title=The World's Top 10 Most Innovative Companies of 2015 in Africa|publisher=Fast Company|date=9 February 2015|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; MEST announced a partnership with [[Samsung]] in April 2015. As part of the agreement, Samsung provided subsidized devices and internship positions, as well as marketing services and mobile application distribution, in exchange for the opportunity to invest in MEST companies through its Samsung Enterprise Business Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disrupt-africa.com/2015/04/mest-partners-samsung-to-support-west-african-startups/|title=MEST Partners Samsung to Support West African Startups|publisher=Disrupt Africa|first=Tom|last=Jackson|date=23 April 2015|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; MEST hosted the first Africa Technology Summit in November 2015 in Accra, Ghana, the event featured panels and keynote presentations from a variety of global and African businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyafrique.com/african-technology-summit-ats-2015-accra-ghana/|title=African Technology Summit (ATS) 2015, Accra Ghana|publisher=Tech Afrique|date=12 August 2015|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, MEST began recruiting EITs from the French-speaking [[Ivory Coast]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2016/11/30/l-incubateur-ghaneen-mest-lance-a-abidjan-son-erasmus-des-start-up-africaines_5041115_3212.html|title=L’incubateur Ghanéen MEST Lance à Abidjan son " Erasmus " des Start-up Africaines|publisher=Le Monde|first=Samir|last=Abdelkrim|date=30 November 2016|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened an additional business incubator in [[Lagos]] while planning to open an additional location in [[Cape Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/654380/ghanas-start-up-incubator-mest-is-rolling-out-its-network-to-kenya-nigeria-and-south-africa/|title=Ghana's Startup Hub Pioneer is Going Pan-African With a $50 Million Fund|publisher=Quartz Africa|first=Yinka|last=Adegoke|date=13 April 2016|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techcabal.com/2016/08/02/neku-atawodi-has-taken-the-reins-at-mests-new-lagos-incubator/|title=Neku Atawodi Has Taken the Reins at MEST's New Lagos Incubator|publisher=TechCabal|first=Osarumen|last=Osamuyi|date=2 August 2016|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Techcab&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techcabal.com/2016/03/22/the-mest-training-programme-is-recruiting-in-south-africa-and-expanding-to-kenya-and-nigeria/|title=The MEST Training Programme Is Recruiting In South Africa And Expanding to Kenya and Nigeria|publisher=TechCabal|first=Eric|last=Mugendi|date=22 March 2016|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, MEST entered a partnership with [[Kosmos Energy]] to form the Kosmos Innovation Centre to focus on creating agriculture solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://yen.com.gh/40975-kosmos-energy-partners-mest-launch-corporate-social-investment-programme.html|title=Kosmos Innovation Centre Launched in Accra|publisher=Yen|first=Ameyaw|last=Debrah|date=April 2016|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citifmonline.com/2016/06/21/kosmos-makes-strides-in-addressing-challenges-in-agric-sector/|title=Kosmos Makes Strides in Addressing Challenges in Agric Sector|publisher=Citifm Online|date=21 June 2016|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, MEST hosted the second Africa Tech Summit in Lagos, Nigeria, including speakers from [[Google]], [[Uber (company)|Uber]], [[Interswitch]], [[Vodacom]] and [[Samsung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disrupt-africa.com/2016/10/mest-to-host-tech-summit-in-lagos/|title=MEST to Host Tech Summit in Lagos|publisher=Disrupt Africa|first=Tom|last=Jackson|date=20 October 2016|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://africabusiness2020.com/2016/11/05/mest-take-africa-tech-summit-nigeria/|title=MEST Take Africa Tech Summit to Nigeria - AB2020|date=2016-11-05|work=AB2020|access-date=2018-02-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Genres''' is an [[artistic movement]] begun in the early 20th century.  The movement is marked by many notable artists who work with a variety of media such as [[video art]], [[body art]], [[Installation art|installation]], [[performance]], and [[sound art]].

==Definition==
New Genres art is commonly identified as [[installation art]], [[Video (disambiguation)|video]], [[film]], [[sound]], [[performance]], [[Digital media]], [[internet art]],&lt;ref&gt;Duron, Julian.

New Genres is a practice which begins with ideas and then moves to the appropriate form or media for that particular idea, sometimes inventing entirely new sites of [[cultural production]], new methodologies, technologies, or [[genres]] in the process. New Genres gives emphasis to questioning preconceived notions of the role of art in culture and its relationship to a specific form or [[List of artistic media|medium]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Historical context==
While no recognized official date marks the beginning of the New Genre period, many{{quantify|date=September 2014}} believe that the early 20th-century work of the [[Dadaists]] and [[Futurists]] initiated this movement.  Their work laid a foundation for the experimental practice of New Genres.  Duchamp's "Fountain" (1917) introduced the idea of the [[readymade]] object: a non-art object which becomes viewed as art due to the intention and designation of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/492875/ready-made |title= ready-made (style of art) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This new use of [[artistic power]] and questioning of the art object opened up the conceptual sphere of New Genres.  These discoveries illuminated the idea that art was possible outside the field of the classical genres like painting and sculpture.

To understand the movement of New Genres, it is important to look at the events occurring simultaneously in the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  In the first half of the century, [[World War I]] broke out and caused devastation to much of Eastern Europe.  In America, the [[Great Depression]] caused a major economic crises that affected many parts of the world.  [[World War II]] quickly followed, splitting the world into two alliances: the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis powers|Axis]].  This war caused tremendous damage and introduced new tragedies into the world, such as the [[Holocaust]] and the first [[nuclear weapons]].

{{wikisource}}
The '''Pact of Umar''' (also known as the '''Covenant of Umar''', '''Treaty of Umar''' or '''Laws of Umar'''; {{lang-ar|شروط عمر}} or {{lang|ar|عهد عمر}} or {{lang|ar|عقد عمر}}), is an [[apocryphal]] [[treaty]] between the [[Muslims]] and the [[Christians]] of either [[Syria]], [[Mesopotamia]],{{sfn|Roggema|2009|p=361}} or [[Jerusalem]]{{sfn|Meri|2005|p=205}} that later gained a canonical status in [[Islamic jurisprudence]]. It specifies rights and restrictions for non-Muslims ([[dhimmis]]) living under Islamic rule. 

There are several versions of the pact, differing both in structure and stipulations.{{sfn|Abu-Munshar|2007|p=63}} While the pact is traditionally attributed to the second [[Rashidun]] [[Caliph]] [[Umar|Umar ibn Khattab]],{{sfn|Thomas|Roggema|2009|p=360}} other jurists and orientalists have doubted this attribution{{sfn|Abu-Munshar|2007|p=63}} with the treaty being attributed to 9th century [[Mujtahid]]s (Islamic scholars) or the [[Umayyad]] Caliph [[Umar II]]. This treaty should not be confused with [[Umar's Assurance| Umar's Assurance of safety to the people of Aelia]] (known as ''al-ʿUhda al-ʿUmariyya'', {{lang-ar|العهدة العمرية}}).

In general, the pact contains a list of rights and restrictions on non-Muslims ([[dhimmis]]). By abiding to them, non-Muslims are granted security of their persons, their families, and their possessions. Other rights and stipulations may also apply. According to [[Ibn Taymiyya]], one of the jurists who accepted the authenticity of the pact, the dhimmis have the right "to free themselves from the Covenant of 'Umar and claim equal status with the Muslims if they enlisted in the army of the state and fought alongside the Muslims in battle."&lt;ref name=Ipgrave&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Georgetown University Press| isbn = 1589017226| last = Ipgrave| first = Michael| title = Justice and Rights: Christian and Muslim Perspectives| year = 2009| page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and authenticity==
According to Abu-Munshar, the historical origin of the document may lie in an agreement made between the Muslim conquerors and the Christians of [[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] or [[Damascus]] which was later extended to [[Dhimmi]]s elsewhere.{{sfn|Roggema|2009|p=361}}  He further writes that, "The humiliating conditions enumerated in the so-called “Pact of Umar” are utterly foreign to the mentality, thoughts and practices of this caliph...The deficiencies [in the textual integrity] support the contention that Umar was not the originator of the document."&lt;ref&gt;Maher Abu-Munshar, ''Islamic Jerusalem And Its Christians: A History of Tolerance And Tensions'', pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some Western historians suggest that the document was based on [[Umar's Assurance]], a treaty concluded between [[Umar|Umar ibn Khattab]] and the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]] following the [[Siege of Jerusalem (637)|capture of Jerusalem]] by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] (637),{{sfn|Meri|2005|p=205}} while others believe the document was either the work of 9th century [[Ijtihad|Mujtahids]] or was forged during the reign of the [[Umayyad]] Caliph [[Umar II]] (717-720),&lt;ref name=emon/&gt; with other clauses added later. Other scholars concluded that the document may have originated in immediate post-conquest milieu and was stylized by later historians.{{sfn|Roggema|2009|p=361}}

Western scholars' opinions varied about the Pact's authenticity. According to Anver M. Emon, "There is intense discussion in the secondary literature" about the Pact's authenticity, With scholars disagreeing on whether it might have originated during the reign of Umar b. al-Khattab or was "a later invention retroactively associated with Umar -- the caliph who famously led the initial imperial expansion -- to endow the contract of dhimma with greater normative weight?"&lt;ref name=emon&gt;{{cite book|last1=Emon|first1=Anver M.|title=Religious Pluralism and Islamic Law: Dhimmis and Others in the Empire of Law|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7MDyXu6bacC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=pact+of+umar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KnODVZXSK8u1-QHvp4H4Bg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pact%20of%20umar&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A.S. Tritton is one scholar who has "suggested that the Pact is a fabrication" because later Muslim conquerors did not apply its terms to their agreements with their non-Muslim subjects, which they would have if the pact had existed earlier. on the other hand Another scholar  Daniel C. Dennet  believes that the Pact was "no different from any other treaty negotiated in that period and that it is well within reason that the Pact we have today , as preserved in al-Tabari's chronicle is an authentic version of that early treaty."&lt;ref name=emon/&gt; Historian Abraham P. Bloch writes that, "Omar was a tolerant ruler, unlikely to impose humiliating conditions upon non-Muslims, or to infringe upon their religious and social freedoms.  His name has been erroneously associated…with the restrictive Covenant of Omar."&lt;ref&gt;Abraham P. Bloch, ''One a Day: An Anthology of Jewish Historical Anniversaries for Every Day of the Year'', p. 314. {{ISBN|0881251089}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Thomas Walker Arnold]], the pact "is in harmony" with Umar's "kindly consideration for his subjects of another faith,&lt;ref name="ArnoldPoI3"&gt;{{cite book

The book ''Classical Islam: a Sourcebook of Religious Literature'', quotes a version of the Pact from ''[[Kitab al-Umm]]'' of [[al-Shafi'i]] (d.204/820) that it says may be "a forerunner to the later document which gained something of a canonical status, making it applicable in many locations ..."&lt;ref name=CIS-138&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Calder|editor1-first=Norman|editor2-last=Mojaddedi,|editor2-first=Jawid|editor3-last=Rippin|editor3-first=Andrew|title=Classical Islam: A Sourcebook of Religious Literature|publisher=Routledge.|page=138|date=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xgLslcH9U0IC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=pact+of+umar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TIaDVb3ULOrLsAT1jJmICw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=pact%20of%20umar&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6792">'''Progesterex''' is a fictitious [[date rape drug]] that would purportedly cause [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]]. It is part of a [[hoax]] that began to circulate in 1999 via [[e-mail]] on the [[internet]]. No actual drug by this name or even with these properties exists, and no such incident has ever been documented or confirmed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160308085250/http://tribune.ie/archive/article/2007/apr/29/beaumont-hospital-investigates-fake-email-warning- Beaumont Hospital investigates fake email warning of rape drug&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The most high profile person falling for the hoax was British MP [[Lynne Featherstone]], who asked a question about the fake drug in Parliament.

==Email contents==
Typical contents of the e-mail [[hoax]] are as follows, although different versions tend to turn up over time:
	
{{Blockquote|"A woman at a nightclub called _______ on Saturday night was taken by 5 men, who according to hospital and police reports, gang raped her before dumping her. Unable to remember the events of the evening, tests later confirmed the repeat rapes along with traces of [[Rohypnol]] in her blood and Progesterex, essentially a small sterilization pill. The drug is now being used by rapists at parties to rape AND sterilize their victims. Progesterex is available to vets to sterilize large animals. Progesterex is being used together with Rohypnol, the date rape drug. As with Rohypnol, all they have to do is drop it into the girl's drink. The girl can't remember a thing the next morning, of all that had taken place the night before. Progesterex, which dissolves in drinks just as easily, is such that the victim doesn't conceive from the rape and the rapist needn't worry about having a paternity test identifying him months later. The drug's effects ARE NOT TEMPORARY - Progesterex was designed to sterilize horses. Any female who takes it WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO CONCEIVE. The weasels can get this drug from anyone who is in the vet school or any university. It's that easy, and Progesterex is about to break out big on campuses everywhere. Believe it or not, there are even sites on the Internet telling people how to use it. Please forward this to everyone you know, especially girls. Be careful when you're out and don't leave your drink unattended. Please make the effort to forward this on to all you know. Guys, please inform all your female friends and relatives."}}

==Debunking==
There is no "sterilization pill" under any name that exists for sterilizing horses. Sterilization of male horses is performed surgically, while mares are usually left unaltered

==Notable examples==
A version of this e-mail was translated and sent around in Brazil in 2008–2009.

A version of this hoax also made the rounds via bulletins on [[MySpace]], [[Bebo]], [[Facebook]], and [[Tagged]] and in the form of a group named "Heads Up Ladies".

According to the Spanish language website VSAntirus.com at least two versions in Spanish have made the rounds since 2001 as well.

A Swedish and later Norwegian version circulated 2008–2009 with a signature of Birgitta Olofsson, Dr Med in nursing science of Umeå University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/myt-om-valdtaktsdrog-pa-ny-turne-1.684112 Myt om våldtäktsdrog på ny turné - DN.se&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==UK Parliament incident==

Featherstone criticised the government stating they "need to do more to discover the unearthly monster who sends them out" and that "their cavalier attitude will not do."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2006/05/02/exclusive-email-on-date-drug-is-a-hoax-115875-17018651/ Exclusive: Email On Date Drug Is A Hoax - Mirror.Co.Uk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG7909143/Mad-Men-star-Christina-Hendricks-is-great-role-model-says-Equalities-Minister.html Mad Men star Christina Hendricks is great role model, says Equalities Minister - Telegraph&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics such as fellow Liberal Democrat James Graham castigated Featherstone's conduct in "criticising the Home Office for not having a response to made up drugs and made up crimes", stating "trivialising rape in this way without bothering to do basic research first doesn’t help anybody".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.theliberati.net/quaequamblog/2006/05/02/bombd/ Quaequam Blog! » Cook’d and Bomb’d&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many see the incident as having strong parallels with a previous case where MP [[David Amess]] asked a question in Parliament about a fictitious drug called "[[CAKE (drug)|Cake]]".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

A '''protected area mosaic''', or '''conservation mosaic''' is a collection of environmentally protected areas that are treated as a whole, either formally or informally.
The protected areas may be of different types, including strictly protected areas and sustainable use areas, which may be administered at different public levels or privately.
They may include areas assigned to indigenous people.
A mosaic may be more flexible and effective than an attempt to combine all the areas into a single conservation unit under one agency.
In practice, results with mosaics in different countries have been mixed.

==Definition==

A conservation mosaic may be defined as "a network of protected areas and complementary landscapes that include combinations of national parks (i.e. the core conservation areas), production landscapes and collectively-owned ethnic territories (i.e. the surrounding areas)".{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|p=x}}
Conservation mosaics are similar to the [[biosphere]]s promoted by [[UNESCO]] under the [[Man and the Biosphere Programme]].{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|p=4}}
The cooperative approach between different agencies and types of protected area avoids the conflicts and disagreements over land use and conservation that often result with a single agency and single type of conservation unit.{{sfn|Nelson|2005|p=247}}
The value of creating protected area mosaics has been the subject of intense debate among conservationists.{{sfn|Conservation International|2009|p=21}}
Protected areas are of great importance in protecting biodiversity, but conservation efforts must take into account the social and economic needs of the surrounding communities and the resulting pressure on land usage.{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|pp=x–xi}}

==National examples==

===Brazil===
[[File:Amazonas BR-319.jpg|thumb|[[BR-319]]. A protected area mosaic has been defined in an effort to reduce deforestation when the road is paved.]]
{{main article|Protected area mosaic (Brazil)}}
A ''[[Protected area mosaic (Brazil)|mosaico de unidades de conservação]]'' is a legally recognized entity in Brazil, a collection of protected areas of the same or different categories that are near to each other, adjoin each other or overlap, and that should be managed as a whole. It may include conservation units, private lands and indigenous territories.{{sfn|Mosaicos de áreas protegidas – ISA}}
Brazil has created a mosaic of federal and state conservation units along the [[BR-319]] highway through the Amazon rainforest in an effort to better prevent deforestation when the highway is paved through more efficient management of a larger area. 
However, WWF-Brazil has pointed out that it is not enough to simply create the protected areas on paper. 
They must be staffed, delimited, legal owners compensated and so on.{{sfn|Six new protected areas created in Brazilian Amazonian state}}

The [[Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park]] in the state of [[Goiás]], Brazil, was expanded by Federal Decree in September 2001 and inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in December 2001.
In 2003 the expansion was successfully challenged and 72% of the national park lost its protection status.
The park is part of the [[Cerrado Biosphere Reserve]].
Brazil has outlined plans for a mosaic of new conservation units with different management categories covering an equivalent area to the expanded National Park, but [[UNESCO]] has questioned whether the mosaic will be sufficient to ensure the statutory protection required for the World Heritage properties.{{sfn|Cerrado Protected Areas ... UNESCO}}

===Colombia===

A 2015 World Bank report on national protected areas in Colombia covering at least {{convert|2000000|ha}} found that with the mosaic approach ecological connectivity had improved in eight of the mosaics, exceeding the target.{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|p=2}}
The local farmers and fishing communities in seven of the conservation mosaics, which included protected areas and their surrounding buffer zones, benefited from sustainable provision and use of
environmental goods and services.{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|p=3}}

===Kenya===

In northern Kenya the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT) organisation covers 19 community conservancies with more than {{convert|3000000|acre}} of wildlife habitat.  
The NRT Council of Elders agreed in May 2010 to found the  Nakuprat – Gotu Community Conservancy beside the [[Shaba National Reserve]] and the [[Ewaso Ng'iro]] river to promote conflict resolution and conserve nature.
The conservancy is part of a protected area mosaic that is a vital habitat for species that include the [[African elephant]] and the endangered [[Grévy's zebra]].{{sfn|Nakuprat Conservancy – Tusk}}

===United Kingdom===

A mosaic of protected areas has evolved in the United Kingdom, with a growing number of types of protected area, some as a result of European Union directives.
The objectives of nature conservation and landscape protection are treated as distinct.
The mosaic has evolved in a manner that results in duplication of effort and funding.
It could benefit from rationalisation and more flexible administration.{{sfn|Bishop|Phillips|Warren}}

===United States===

The protected area mosaics of the [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]], [[El Malpais National Monument|El Malpais]], [[San Pedro River (Arizona)|San Pedro]] and [[Las Cienegas National Conservation Area|Las Cienegas]] areas in Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona have been assembled by a variety of government and non-government organisations to protect the environment while respecting land use demands of the southwest of the United States.
This broad approach to ecosystem planning and management seems more fair and effective than former single-agency approaches.{{sfn|Nelson|2005|p=245}}
The Great Sand Dunes Monument Area combined various type of protected area to satisfy the objectives of the [[National Park Service]], [[The Nature Conservancy]] and other organizations, and to combine conservation and sustainable use of the ecosystem.
The result was similar to the protected area mosaic recommended in the early 1980s for parts of the [[Yukon]] in Canada.
Implementation was staged, with many interactions and adaptations over time.{{sfn|Day|Nelson|Sportza|2003|p=142}}

[[Image:REAL UIUC.jpg|thumb|200px|The Regional Economics Applications Laboratory (REAL)]]
'''''The Regional Economics Applications Laboratory (REAL)''''' at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] is a [[regional science]] research center for advanced graduate students in the fields of economics, geography, urban and regional planning, computer science and mathematics. Professor [[Geoffrey J.D. Hewings]] is a co-founder of REAL and served as Director until 2016 (currently as Emeritus Director). Professor [[Sandy Dall'erba]] serves as the REAL Director since 2016. 

==Main goal==
Created in 1989 by Philip Israilevich and [[Geoffrey J.D. Hewings]], the Regional Economics Applications Laboratory (REAL) at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] started as a cooperative venture between the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago]] and the [[University of Illinois]]. 

While analyses of economies at the national level have long been prominent in the field of economics, increasing fragmentation of the production process in conjunction with increasing regional specialization due to the reduction of transportation costs obliges us to consider economies from a sub-national or even local perspective. Further, the last decade has seen remarkable progress in techniques for spatial economic analysis – the measurement and interpretation of economic activity across geographies as small as counties to units as extensive as individual countries.  

Based on these approaches and techniques, REAL’s mission is to provide timely, high quality analytical economic information for a variety of uses such as public policy decision making by public sector agencies and for strategic marketing in the private sector. REAL's capabilities revolve around comprehensive state and metropolitan models that integrate econometric and input-output analysis to provide for both impact and forecasting analyses. Current activities focus on interstate trade, forecasts for the [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] and other [[Midwest]] economies, housing market analysis and forecasts, demographic-economic modeling (especially the role of aging and immigration) and the development of alternative computable general equilibrium models created on the same data base.  

Research at REAL always attempts to provide a range of exposure to new curricula materials, methods of conducting interdisciplinary and international collaborative research and guidance in the preparation of material for dissemination in the public policy arena.  The latter component is extremely important and undervalued, yet academic research over the next decade is likely to be more project-driven with funding from stakeholders whose interest lie in the policy arena and less in the academic or scholarly content.  Hence, it is important that scholars learn, at an early stage in their career, how to balance the needs of client-based research with demands imposed on them by the academy for demonstrating high levels of scholarly achievement.  

REAL was created to operate like a science laboratory - with students and faculty together in one space, promoting interaction and collaboration.  A weekly seminar series provides students with many opportunities to present their research and an active Discussion Paper series on the web ensures wide dissemination for research.  REAL is supported by external grants and contracts, many of which have been developed with agencies in [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], and [[Austria]].  Most of the research has successfully served two markets - academic journals and public policy.

==Student involvement==
Since its inception, REAL has provided at least two years (and usually more) support for 38 doctoral students from agricultural economics, economics, geography and urban and regional planning, welcomed 8 "bolsa sandwiche" PhD students from [[Brazil]] who spent one year at REAL working on their doctoral dissertations and hosted over 100 international visitors (visiting students, visiting scholars and visiting professors) who stayed three months or more. Several experiences of foreign scholars coming informally to the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] demonstrated that a period of one or two semesters resulted in a major contribution to the thesis of these young researchers, as well as to their personal enhancement.  At any one time, from 15 to 30 visitors and students will be in residence. An updated list of past and current members is available from the following link: http://www.real.uiuc.edu/[http://www.real.uiuc.edu/]

Foreign visitors appreciate more especially the exposure to the challenges, issues and opportunities in another country because it provides them an important perspective that cannot be “taught” effectively by distance learning. Residence in another country, coupled with engagement with other students and faculty involved in their work provide them with an invaluable learning opportunity. In addition, the mass of students and the profound respect of REAL’s director for the various techniques of regional science allow foreign visitors to build quickly partnerships for their work and receive sound feedback.

Over the years, several colleagues, such as Rodney Jensen ([[Australia]]), Michael Sonis ([[Israel]]), Eduardo Haddad ([[Brazil]]), Joaquim Guilhoto ([[Brazil]]), Carlos Azzoni ([[Brazil]]), Miguel Marquez ([[Spain]]), Julian Ramajo ([[Spain]]) and Nikolaos Kalyviotis ([[Greece]]) have become regular visitors.  The collaboration with Sonis has yielded over 75 publications (including two edited monographs and 24 book chapters). About one third of REAL's alumni are working in academia, another third in local, state and international agencies and the remaining third in the private sector.

The sister organization of REAL is EU-REAL[http://eco.unex.es/eureal/], the [[European Union]] – Regional Economics Applications Laboratory. EU-REAL is a research net in regional science integrated by European scholars tied to REAL. Their goal is to foment the cooperation of their different members, establish permanent linkage among the participant researchers, and promote the development of different investigation lines in regional science.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1419">The '''Remote Sensing Applications Center''' ('''RSAC''') is a facility of the [[United States Forest Service|United States Forest Service (USFS)]]. It receives weather and fire-monitoring data remotely-sensed by [[artificial satellite|satellites]], and converts it into maps and reports for the USFS.

==Location and purpose==
The RSAC is a software development organization, housed at the same location as its corresponding operational organization, the [[United States Forest Service|USFS]] Geospatial Technology and Applications Center (GTAC), in Salt Lake City, Utah.&lt;ref name=rsac_web_desc&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fs.fed.us/eng/rsac/ |title=Remote Sensing Applications Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RSAC and GTAC assist USFS field operations with combined data from fire-monitoring and weather satellites and other remotely-sensed data, along with mapping and geological surveys (“geospatial technology”).

The RSAC's principal goal is to develop and implement less costly ways for the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] to obtain information it needs to manage wildfires, water, and forest resources.&lt;ref name=rsac_web_desc/&gt;

[[File:ChineseJadePlaques.JPG|thumb|250px|Chinese [[jade]] and [[steatite]] plaques, in the [[Scythian]]-style animal art of the steppes. 4th-3rd century BCE. [[British Museum]].]]
Many artistic influences transited along the [[Silk Road]], especially through the [[Central Asia]], where [[Hellenistic]], [[Iran]]ian, [[India]]n and [[China|Chinese]] influence were able to interact. In particular [[Greco-Buddhist art]] represent one of the most vivid examples of this interaction.
As shown on the 1st century CE Silk Road map, there is no single road but a whole network of long-distance routes: mainly two land routes and one sea route.

==Scythian art==
Following contacts of metropolitan China with nomadic western and northwestern border territories in the 8th century BCE, [[gold]] was introduced from [[Central Asia]],  and Chinese [[jade]] carvers began to make imitation designs of the [[steppe]]s, adopting the [[Scythian]]-style animal art of the steppes (descriptions of animals locked in combat). This style is particularly reflected in the rectangular belt plaques made of [[gold]] and [[bronze]] with alternate versions in [[jade]] and [[steatite]].&lt;ref&gt;''"There is evidence of gold belt-plaques with "Scythian" "animal style" art, greaves, barrows and other indications of the penetration of steppe cultures south of the Yangzi before the Han period"'' (Mallory and Mair "The Tarim Mummies", p.329)&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though that happened, the correspondence between the "Scythians" as an ethnic group and their material culture is still subject to discussion and research. The subject is  part of the broader "nomadic" and "sedentary"  debate.

==Hellenistic art==

Following the expansion of the [[Greco-Bactrian]]s into Central Asia, Greek influences on Han art have often been suggested ([[Hirth]], [[Rostovtzeff]]). Designs with [[Rosette (design)|rosette]] flowers, geometric lines, and glass inlays, suggestive of Hellenistic influences, can be found on some early [[Han dynasty]] bronze mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou bowl: ''"RED EARTHENWARE BOWL, DECORATED WITH A SLIP AND INLAID WITH GLASS PASTE. Eastern Zhou period, 4th-3rd century BC. This bowl was probably intended to copy a more precious and possibly foreign vessel in bronze or even silver. Glass was little used in China. Its popularity at the end of the Eastern Zhou period was probably due to foreign influence."'' British Museum notice to the bowl (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"The things which China received from the Graeco-Iranian world- the pomegranate and other "Chang-Kien" plants, the heavy equipment of the cataphract, the traces of Greeks influence on Han art (such as) the famous white bronze mirror of the Han period with Graeco-Bactrian designs (...) in the Victoria and Albert Museum"'' (W. W. Tarn, ''The Greeks in Bactria and India'', 1980, pp. 363-364)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greco-Buddhist art==

===Buddha===

[[File:Seokguram Buddha.JPG|thumb|250px|A Buddha in [[Seokguram]], South Korea. It was influenced by [[Gandhara]] art.]]

The image of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], originating during the 1st century CE in northern India (areas of [[Gandhara]] and [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]]) was transmitted progressively through Central Asia and then China until it reached Japan in the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;''"Needless to say, the influence of Greek art on Japanese Buddhist art, via the Buddhist art of Gandhara and India, was already partly known in, for example, the comparison of the wavy drapery of the Buddha images, in what was, originally, a typical Greek style"'' (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p19)&lt;/ref&gt;

To this day however the transmission of many iconographical details is still visible, such as the [[Hercules]] inspiration behind the [[Nio]] guardian deities in front of [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Japanese Buddhist temples]], or representations of the Buddha reminiscent of Greek art such as the Buddha in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]].

==Eastern iconography in the West==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:KanishkaBuddha2.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The Buddha (with the legend "BODDO" in Greek script) with an aureole envelopping the whole body, on a coin of the [[Kushan]] king [[Kanishka]], 2nd century AD.]] --&gt;
Some elements of western iconography were adopted from the East along the Silk Road. The [[aureole]] in Christian art first appeared in the 5th century, but practically the same device was known several centuries earlier, in non-Christian [[art]]. It is found in some [[Persian people|Persian]] representations of kings and Gods, and appears on coins of the [[Kushan]] kings [[Kanishka]], [[Huvishka]] and [[Vasudeva]], as well as on most representations of the Buddha in [[Greco-Buddhist art]] from the 1st century CE.
Another image which appears to have transferred from China via the Silk Road is the symbol of the [[Three hares]], showing three animals running in a circle. It has been traced back to the [[Sui dynasty]] in China, and is still to be found in sacred sites in many parts of Western Europe, and especially in churches in [[Dartmoor]], [[Devon]].

'''4)''' Shukongōshin, manifestation of [[Vajrapani]], as protector deity of [[Buddhist temples in Japan]].]]Another Buddhist deity, named [[Shukongoshin]], one of the wrath-filled protector deities of Buddhist temples in Japan, is also an interesting case of transmission of the image of the famous Greek god [[Herakles]] to the Far-East along the Silk Road. [[Herakles]] was used in Greco-Buddhist art to represent [[Vajrapani]], the protector of the Buddha, and his representation was then used in China and Japan to depict the protector gods of Buddhist temples.&lt;ref&gt;''"The origin of the image of Vajrapani should be explained. This deity is the protector and guide of the Buddha Sakyamuni. His image was modelled after that of Hercules. (...) The Gandharan Vajrapani was transformed in Central Asia and China and afterwards transmitted to Japan, where it exerted stylistic influences on the wrestler-like statues of the Guardina Deities (Nio)."'' (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p23)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wind god===
[[File:WindGods.JPG|thumb|280px|Iconographical evolution of the Wind God. '''Left:''' Greek Wind God from [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], 2nd century. '''Middle:''' Wind God from (Kızıl), [[Tarim Basin]], 7th century. '''Right:''' Japanese Wind God [[Fūjin]], 17th century.]]Various other artistic influences from the Silk Road can be found in Asia, one of the most striking being that of the Greek Wind God [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]], transiting through Central Asia and China to become the Japanese [[Shinto]] wind god [[Fūjin]].&lt;ref&gt;''"The Japanese wind god images do not belong to a separate tradition apart from that of their Western counter-parts but share the same origins. (...) One of the characteristics of these Far Eastern wind god images is the wind bag held by this god with both hands, the origin of which can be traced back to the shawl or mantle worn by Boreas/ Oado."'' (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p21)&lt;/ref&gt;

In consistency with Greek iconography for Boreas, the Japanese wind god holds above his head with his two hands a draping or "wind bag" in the same general attitude. The abundance of hair have been kept in the Japanese rendering, as well as exaggerated facial features.

===Floral scroll pattern===

'''Middle right:''' Japanese temple tile, 7th century, [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. '''Bottom:''' Tile detail from a Japanese contemporary house, [[Tokyo]], 2005.]]Finally, the Greek artistic motif of the floral scroll was transmitted from the Hellenistic world to the area of the [[Tarim Basin]] around the 2nd century CE, as seen in [[Serindian art]] and wooden architectural remains. It then was adopted by China between the 4th and 6th century, where it is found on tiles and ceramics, and was then transmitted to Japan where it is found quite literally in the decoration of the roof tiles of Japanese Buddhist temples from around the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;The transmission of the floral scroll pattern from West to East is presented in the regular exhibition of Ancient Japanese Art, at the [[Tokyo National Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The clearest one are from the 7th century [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] temple building tiles, some of them exactly depicting vines and grapes. These motifs have evolved towards more symbolic representations, but essentially remain to this day in the roof tile decorations of many Japanese traditional-style buildings.

In [[Biblical criticism]], '''''Sitz im Leben''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈzɪt͡s ɪm ˈle:bn̩}}) is a [[German language|German]] phrase roughly translating to "setting in life". It stands for the alleged context in which a text, or object, has been created, and its function and purpose at that time. The ''Sitz im Leben'' is also used to refer to the social, ethnic and cultural setting of a site at a particular era. When interpreting a text, object, or region, the ''Sitz im Leben'' has to be taken into consideration in order to allow a proper contextual interpretation. 

==Origins==
The term originated with the German Protestant theologian [[Hermann Gunkel]]. The term ''Sitz im Volksleben'' ("setting in the life of the people") was employed for the first time in 1906 and the term ''Sitz im Leben'' in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;''Prophets and paradigms: essays in honor of Gene M. Tucker'' ed. Gene M. Tucker, Stephen Breck Reid 1996 p. 113 Form-Criticism of the Old Testament (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Sitz im Leben'' was used by classic form critics, as pointed out by Chris Tuckett, "...it has been pointed out that the term ''Sitz im Leben'' was used in a rather peculiar way by the classic [[Form criticism|form critics]]. In fact the term is a sociological one, describing a typical situation within any community"&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Mark Tuckett ''Reading the New Testament: methods of interpretation'' 1987 – 200.14"&lt;/ref&gt; so that the meaning of the text is bound up with its function in the community,&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Kraus, R. Glenn Wooden ''Septuagint research: issues and challenges'' 2006 p. 23 "With the introduction of the term ''Sitz im Leben'' we see that for NETS the meaning and significance of the text is bound up with its inferred function within the community that produced it."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Contextualization (sociolinguistics)|social context]].&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Rendtorff ''The Old Testament: an introduction'' 1985 "Gunkel's term 'Sitz im Leben' denotes a particular situation of communication with which a genre – or even several genres – may be connected. In a more comprehensive sense the term can therefore also denote the social context in ..."&lt;/ref&gt; However some have noted that use in Biblical [[exegesis]] can be problematic.&lt;ref&gt;W. S. Vorster, J. Eugene Botha – ''Speaking of Jesus: essays on biblical language, gospel narrative'' 1999 p. 336 ("The use of the term ''Sitz im Leben'' has become very misleading and problematic, see Guttgemanns 1970:82ff.")&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contextualization==
At its simplest, it describes what occasions certain passages in the [[Bible]] were written for, and is often called the "genres" of the Bible.{{Citation needed|date= December 2014}} Simple examples of ''Sitz im Leben'' include the classification of material into letters, poems of lament, [[parable]]s, [[psalms]], and songs. However, ''Sitz im Leben'' can also involve many other considerations; who the speaker of a passage was, his role in life, the nature of his audience, and so on.{{Citation needed|date= December 2014}} Taken out of its original [[Context principle|context]], the original meaning of a passage is often lost. So for example, a psalm may have its ''Sitz'' in the ritual of the temple cult, or as an artistic votive offering, or in the sense of injustice arising from a power structure in Jerusalem society, or lament in defeat. A major aim of [[hermeneutics]] ([[Contextualization (Bible translation)|contextualizing interpretation]]) is to uncover such things.{{Citation needed|date= December 2014}}

The term is also used to describe the contextual interpretation of archaeological artefacts and ancient sites. Only through examining the historical context can one properly interpret them.

==Development==
Today the term is also used outside theological research, when it is needed to examine a text for its sociologically relevant aspects. For example: the ''Sitz im Leben'' of a [[counting rhyme]] like "[[eeny, meeny, miny, moe]]" is a group of children deciding among themselves who will play in a game; when the children chant the song, we know that they are choosing who will play, but if we are unaware of this context, the rhyme appears merely to be nonsense about toes.{{Citation needed|date= December 2014}}

In [[linguistics]] the ''Sitz im Leben'' is determined by the text [[pragmatics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medienkultur und Medienlinguistik. Komparative Textsortengeschichte(n) der amerikanischen CBS Evening News und der Schweizer Tagesschau|last=Luginbühl|first=Martin|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2014|isbn=9783035106619|location=Bern|pages=23ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--{{original research|date=May 2011}}--&gt; 
'''Terminology''' is the study of terms and their use. '''Terms''' are [[word]]s and [[compound word]]s or multi-word expressions that in specific contexts are given specific meanings—these may deviate from the meanings the same words have in other contexts and in everyday language.{{clarify|date=June 2018|reason=An example and counterexample are needed.}}&lt;ref&gt;a word or expression that has a precise meaning in some uses or is peculiar to a science, art, profession, or subject.{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Term|accessdate=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terminology is a discipline that studies, among other things, the development of such terms and their interrelationships within a specialized domain. Terminology differs from [[lexicography]], as it involves the study of [[concept]]s, conceptual systems and their labels (''terms''), whereas lexicography studies words and their meanings.

Terminology is a discipline that systematically studies the "labelling or designating of concepts" particular to one or more subject fields or domains of human activity. It does this through the research and analysis of terms in context for the purpose of documenting and promoting consistent usage. Terminology can be limited to one or more languages (for example, "multilingual terminology" and "bilingual terminology"), or may have an [[interdisciplinarity]] focus on the use of terms in different fields.

==Overview==
The discipline of terminology consists primarily of the following aspects:

* analyzing the concepts and concept structures used in a field or domain of activity
* identifying the terms assigned to the concepts
* in the case of bilingual or multilingual terminology, establishing correspondences between terms in the various languages
* compiling the [[terminology (artifact)|terminology]], on paper or in [[database]]s
* managing [[terminology database]]s
* creating new terms, as required.

==Types of terminology==
A distinction is made between two types of terminology work:
* '''Ad hoc work on terminology''', which deals with a single term or a limited number of terms
* '''Systematic collection of terminology''', which deals with all the terms in a specific subject field or domain of activity, often by creating a structured [[ontology (information science)|ontology]] of the terms within that domain and their interrelationships.

Ad hoc terminology is prevalent in the [[translation]] profession, where a translation for a specific term (or group of terms) is required quickly to solve a particular translation problem.

==Terminology as a discipline==
A ''terminologist'' intends to hone categorical organization by improving the accuracy and content of its terminology. Technical industries and [[standardization]] institutes compile their own glossaries.  This provides the consistency needed in the various areas&amp;mdash;fields and branches, movements and specialties&amp;mdash;to work with core terminology to then offer material for the discipline's traditional and doctrinal literature.

Terminology is also then key in boundary-crossing problems, such as in language translation and [[social epistemology]].
Terminology helps to build bridges and to extend one area into another. [[Translator]]s research the terminology of the languages they translate. Terminology is taught alongside translation in universities and translation schools. Large translation departments and translation bureaus have a ''Terminology'' section.

'''''The American Religion: The Emergence of the Post-Christian Nation''''' (1992; second edition 2006) is a book by literary critic [[Harold Bloom]], in which the author covers the topic of [[religion in the United States]] from a perspective which he calls ''religious criticism''.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Harold, ''The American Religion'', second edition (Chu Hartley Publishers, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Religious denominations Bloom discusses include [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], [[Christian Science]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and the [[Southern Baptist Convention]].

==Summary==

Bloom lays out his conception of a practice of ''religious criticism'', by which he does not mean [[criticism of religion]].  He distinguishes the practice from other aspects of [[religious studies]] (e.g., [[history of religion]] or [[philosophy of religion]]) by analogy with his practice of [[literary criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bloom says, literary criticism involves aspects of history ''et cetera'',  but is distinguished by having a focus on [[Aesthetics#aesthetic judgment|aesthetic judgments]] concerning literature.  Bloom's religious criticism thus will involve history ''et cetera'', but also pay attention particularly to the [[spirituality|spiritual]] values of religions.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this book, Bloom begins this practice by looking at religious groups in the [[United States of America]]. Bloom identifies [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[William James]] as previous scholars who practiced religious criticism of American religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;  He concludes that in America there is a single, dominant religion of which many nominally distinct denominations are a part.  Among these he identifies [[Mormonism]], the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], [[Pentecostalism]], and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventism]].  To a lesser extent however, he also includes nearly all "Christian" denominations in America, including [[mainline Protestantism]] and [[Roman Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bloom's view is that all of these groups in America are united by requiring that each person may only truly meet with the divine when experiencing a "total inward solitude" and that salvation cannot be achieved by engaging with a community, but only through a one-to-one confrontation with the divine.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; While Bloom suggests that this American form of religion is to some extent a continuation of [[Enthusiasm]] in Europe, American religious groups are rightly distinguished from traditional [[Christianity]]: Although all of these groups identify as Christian, Bloom believes they represent a radical departure from the core aspects of that religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bloom says that the American religion is rather more like a form of [[Gnosticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloom says that the events of the [[Second Great Awakening]] at [[Cane Ridge]] were formative for the American religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloom regards the American Religion as successful by his standards for religious imagination; however, he distinguishes this success from the social and political consequences of the religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  At times he criticizes elements in the American religion for their political activities, saying even that he is "politically appalled by what may be some of its consequences. Since the Reagan-Bush national Republicans have become one with the American Religion, my fear is that we will never again see a Democrat in the Presidency during my lifetime."&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

In ''[[Reviews in American History]]'', [[Henry F. May]] writes that the work is "brilliant  and  original" and that "Historians interested in American religion ... will do well to read it and think about what it says." He also however criticizes Bloom for being "unabashedly subjective and sometimes wrong-headed" and using "sweeping  generalizations".&lt;ref&gt;May, Henry F., "Democratic Gnosticism: The American Religion?", ''Reviews in American History'', Vol. 21, No. 2 (Jun., 1993), p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', [[Richard John Neuhaus]] dismissed the book as "a 288-page imaginative flirtation with nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;Neuhaus, Richard John, "Reviews: On Faith: ''The American Religion: The Emergence of the Post-Christian Nation'' By Harold Bloom", ''Commentary'' (September 1992), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Neuhaus says that Bloom's interpretations of various denominations unduly ignore the explicit statements from these religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;Neuhaus (1992), p. 57 &amp; 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]]'', James P. Hanigan says that Bloom offers "suggestive and important insights", particularly the claim that traditional Christianity is not well-suited to Americans, and that the belief in direct experience of God is connected to [[anti-intellectualism]].  Hanigan suggests though that Bloom's argument is motivated by his own "Gnostic" spirituality, and concludes that it is, in the end, unpersuasive.&lt;ref&gt;Hanigan, James P., "Book Review: ''The American Religion'' by Harold Bloom", ''America'' (October 3, 1992), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==

The first edition was published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in 1992 with the full title, ''The American Religion: The Emergence of the Post-Christian Nation''.  The second edition was published by Chu Hartley Publishers in 2006 without the subtitle and included a new [[afterword]].

{{lead too short|date=January 2017}}
[[Sociology of religion|Sociological]] and [[Anthropology of religion|anthropological]] '''theories about religion''' (or '''theories of religion''') generally attempt to explain the [[origin of religion|origin]] and [[social function|function of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segal|2005|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories define what they present as universal characteristics of [[religious belief]] and [[Religious behaviour|practice]].

==History==
From [[presocratic]] times, ancient authors advanced [[:wikt:prescientific | prescientific]] theories about religion.&lt;ref name="Segal 2005, p. 49"&gt;Segal 2005, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Herodotus]] (484 – 425 [[Common Era|BCE]]) saw the gods of Greece as the same as the gods of Egypt.&lt;ref name="Pals, page 4"&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euhemerus]] (about 330 – 264 BCE) regarded gods as excellent historical persons whom admirers eventually [[Euhemerism|came to worship]].&lt;ref name="Pals, page 4"/&gt;

Scientific theories, inferred and tested by the [[comparative sociology | comparative method]], emerged after data from tribes and peoples all over the world became available in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="Segal 2005, p. 49"/&gt; [[Max Müller]] (1823-1900) has the reputation of having founded the scientific study of religion; he advocated a comparative method that developed into  [[comparative religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, [[Clifford Geertz]] (1926-2006) and others questioned the validity of abstracting a general theory of all religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Theories of religion can be classified into:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Substantive (or [[essentialist]]) theories that focus on the contents of religions and the meaning the contents have for people. This approach asserts that people have faith because beliefs make sense insofar as they hold value and are comprehensible. The theories by Tylor and Frazer (focusing on the explanatory value of religion for its adherents), by Rudolf Otto (focusing on the importance of [[religious experience]], more specifically experiences that are both fascinating and terrifying) and by Mircea Eliade (focusing on the longing for otherworldly perfection, the quest for meaning, and the search for patterns in mythology in various religions) offer examples of substantive theories.
* [[Structural functionalism|Functional]] (and in a stronger form [[Reductionism|reductionist]]) theories that focus on the social or psychological functions that religion has for a group or a person. In simple terms, the functional approach sees religion as "performing certain functions for society"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Christiano|Swatos|Kivisto|2008|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theories by Karl Marx (role of religion in capitalist and pre-capitalist societies), Sigmund Freud ([[psychology|psychological]] origin of religious beliefs), Émile Durkheim (social function of religions), and the theory by Stark and Bainbridge exemplify functional theories.&lt;ref name="hirr.hartsem.edu"&gt;{{harvnb|Nielsen|1998|loc=Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach tends to be static, with the exception of Marx' theory, and unlike e.g. Weber's approach, which treats of the interaction and dynamic processes between religions and the rest of societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other dichotomies according to which theories or descriptions of religions can be classified include:&lt;ref name="Kunin, page 66"&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "insider" versus "outsider" perspectives (roughly corresponding to [[emic and etic|emic versus etic]] descriptions)
* individualist versus social views
* [[Sociocultural evolution|evolutionist]] versus [[relativism|relativist]] views

==Methodologies==
Early '''essentialists''', such as Tylor and Frazer, looked for similar beliefs and practices in all societies, especially the more primitive ones, more or less regardless of time and place.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|loc=Emile Durkheim}}&lt;/ref&gt; They relied heavily on reports made by missionaries, discoverers, and colonial civil servants. These were all investigators who had a religious background themselves, thus they looked at religion from the inside. Typically they did not practice investigative field work, but used the accidental reports of others. This method left them open to criticism for lack of universality, which many freely admitted. The theories could be updated, however, by considering new reports, which [[Robert Ranulph Marett]] (1866-1943) did for Tylor's theory of the evolution of religion.

Field workers deliberately sent out by universities and other institutions to collect specific cultural data made available a much greater database than random reports. For example, the [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]] (1902-1973) preferred detailed [[Ethnography|ethnographical]] study of tribal religion as more reliable. He criticised the work of his predecessors, [[Max Müller|Müller]], [[Edward Burnett Tylor|Tylor]], and [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], as untestable speculation. He called them "armchair anthropologists".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans-Pritchard|1965|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans-Pritchard|1965|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second methodology, '''functionalism''', seeks explanations of religion that are outside of religion; i.e., the theorists are generally (but not necessarily) atheists or agnostics themselves. As did the essentialists, the functionalists proceeded from reports to investigative studies. Their fundamental assumptions, however, are quite different; notably, they apply what is called{{by whom|date=April 2015}} "methodological naturalism". When explaining religion they reject divine or [[supernatural]] explanations for the status or origins of religions because they are not scientifically testable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, theorists such as Marett (an Anglican) excluded scientific results altogether, defining religion as the domain of the unpredictable and unexplainable; that is, comparative religion is the rational (and scientific) study of the irrational. The dichotomy between the two classifications is not bridgeable, even though they have the same methods, because each excludes the data of the other.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

The functionalists and some of the later essentialists (among others E. E. Evans-Pritchard) have criticized the '''substantive''' view as neglecting social aspects of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|pp=47, 200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such critics go so far as to brand Tylor's and Frazer's views on the origin of religion as unverifiable speculation.&lt;ref name="Pals, page 47"&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view of [[monotheism]] as more evolved than [[polytheism]] represents a mere preconception, they assert. There is evidence that monotheism is more prevalent in hunter societies than in agricultural societies.{{cn|date=November 2015}} The view of a uniform progression in folkways is criticized as unverifiable, as the writer [[Andrew Lang]] (1844–1912) and E. E. Evans-Pritchard assert.&lt;ref name=Sharpe2005&gt;{{harvnb|Sharpe|2005|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter criticism presumes that the evolutionary views of the early cultural anthropologists envisaged a uniform cultural evolution. Another criticism supposes that Tylor and Frazer were individualists (unscientific). However, some support that supposed approach as worthwhile, among others the anthropologist [[Robin W.G.

===Evolutionary theories===
{{main|Evolutionary origin of religions|Evolutionary psychology of religion}}
Evolutionary theories view religion as either an adaptation or a byproduct. Adaptationist theories view religion as being of adaptive value to the survival of Pleistocene humans. Byproduct theories view religion as a [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrel]].

===Edward Burnett Tylor===
[[File:PSM V26 D156 Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|250px|Edward Burnett Tylor]]
The [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] (1832–1917) defined religion as belief in spiritual beings and stated that this belief originated as explanations of natural phenomena. Belief in spirits grew out of attempts to explain life and death. Primitive people used human dreams in which spirits seemed to appear as an indication that the human mind could exist independent of a body. They used this by extension to explain life and death, and belief in the after life. [[Myth]]s and [[deity|deities]] to explain natural phenomena originated by analogy and an extension of these explanations. His theory assumed that the psyches of all peoples of all times are more or less the same and that explanations in [[Unilineal evolution#Tylor .26 Morgan|cultures and religions tend to grow more sophisticated]] via [[monotheism|monotheist]] religions, such as [[Christianity]] and eventually to [[science]]. Tylor saw practices and beliefs in modern societies that were similar to those of primitive societies as ''survivals'', but he did not explain why they survived.

===James George Frazer===
[[James George Frazer]] (1854–1941) followed Tylor's theories to a great extent in his book [[The Golden Bough]], but he distinguished between [[magical thinking|magic]] and [[religion]]. [[Magic (paranormal)|Magic]] is used to influence the natural world in the primitive man's struggle for survival. He asserted that [[Sympathetic magic|magic relied on an uncritical belief of primitive people in contact and imitation]]. For example, precipitation may be invoked by the primitive man by sprinkling water on the ground. He asserted that according to them magic worked through laws. In contrast religion is faith that the natural world is ruled by one or more deities with personal characteristics with whom can be pleaded, not by laws.

===Rudolf Otto===

The theologian [[Rudolf Otto]] (1869–1937) focused on [[religious experience]], more specifically moments that he called [[numinous]] which means "Wholly Other". He described it as ''mysterium tremendum'' (terrifying mystery) and ''mysterium fascinans'' (awe inspiring, fascinating mystery). He saw religion as emerging from these experiences.&lt;ref name="hirr.hartsem.edu"/&gt;

He asserted that these experiences arise from a special, non-rational faculty of the human mind, largely unrelated to other faculties, so religion cannot be [[reductionism|reduced]] to culture or society. Some of his views, among others that the experience of the [[numinous]] was caused by a [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] reality, are untestable and hence unscientific.&lt;ref name="Kunin, page 66"/&gt;

His ideas strongly influenced [[Phenomenology of religion|phenomenologists]] and [[Mircea Eliade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mircea Eliade===
[[File:Mircea Eliade2.jpg|thumb|250px|Mircea Eliade]]
{{main|Eternal return (Eliade)|Hierophany|}}
[[Mircea Eliade]]'s (1907–1986) approach grew out of the [[phenomenology of religion]]. Like Otto, he saw religion as something special and autonomous, that cannot be [[reductionism|reduced]] to the social, economical or psychological alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Durkheim, he saw the [[Sacred (comparative religion)|sacred]] as central to religion, but differing from Durkheim, he views the sacred as often dealing with the [[supernatural]], not with the clan or society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The daily life of an ordinary person is connected to the sacred by the appearance of the sacred, called [[hierophany]]. [[Theophany]] (an appearance of a god) is a special case of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Eternal return (Eliade)|The Myth of the Eternal Return]]'' Eliade wrote that archaic men wish to participate in the sacred, and that they long to return to lost paradise outside the historic time to escape meaninglessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primitive man could not endure that his struggle to survive had no meaning.&lt;ref name="Pals, page 180"&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eliade, man had a [[nostalgia]] (longing) for an otherworldly perfection. Archaic man wishes to escape the ''terror of time'' and saw [[cyclic time|time as cyclic]].&lt;ref name="Pals, page 180"/&gt; Historical religions like Christianity and Judaism revolted against this older concept of cyclic time. They provided meaning and contact with the sacred ''in'' history through the god of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade sought and found patterns in [[mythology|myth]] in various cultures, e.g. [[sky god]]s such as [[Zeus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade's methodology was studying [[comparative religion]] of various cultures and societies more or less regardless of other aspects of these societies, often relying on second hand reports. He also used some personal knowledge of other societies and cultures for his theories, among others his knowledge of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[folk religion]].

He has been criticized for vagueness in defining his key concepts. Like Frazer and Tylor he has also been accused of out-of-context comparisons of religious beliefs of very different societies and cultures.
He has also been accused of having a pro-religious bias (Christian and Hindu), though this bias does not seem essential for his theory.

===E. E. Evans-Pritchard&lt;!--linked from 'E. E. Evans-Pritchard'--&gt;===
[[File:Bust of E. E. Evans-Pritchard.jpg|thumb|250px|Bust of E. E. Evans-Pritchard in the Social and Cultural Anthropology Library, Oxford]]
The [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard|Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard]] (1902–1973) did extensive [[ethnography|ethnographic]] studies among the [[Azande]] and [[Nuer people|Nuer]] peoples who were considered "primitive" by society and earlier scholars. Evans-Pritchard saw these people as different, but not primitive.

Unlike the previous scholars, Evans-Pritchard did not propose a grand universal theory and he did extensive long-term fieldwork among "primitive" peoples, studying their culture and religion, among other among the [[Azande]]. Not just passing contact, like Eliade.

He argued that the religion of the Azande ([[witchcraft]] and [[oracle]]s) can not be understood without the social context and its social function. Witchcraft and oracles played a great role in solving disputes among the Azande. In this respect he agreed with Durkheim, though he acknowledged that Frazer and Tylor were right that their religion also had an intellectual explanatory aspect. The Azande's faith in witchcraft and oracles was quite logical and consistent once some fundamental tenets were accepted. Loss of faith in the fundamental tenets could not be endured because of its social importance and hence they had an elaborate system of explanations (or excuses) against disproving evidence. Besides an alternative system of terms or school of thought did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was heavily critical about earlier theorists of [[primitive religion]] with the exception of [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]], asserting that they made statements about primitive people without having enough inside knowledge to make more than a guess. In spite of his praise of Bruhl's works, Evans-Pritchard disagreed with Bruhl's statement that a member of a "primitive" tribe saying "I am the moon" is prelogical, but that this statement makes perfect sense within their culture if understood metaphorically.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|loc=Evans-Pritchard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the Azande, Evans-Pritchard, also studied the neighbouring, but very different [[Nuer people|Nuer]] people. The Nuer had had an abstract monotheistic faith, somewhat similar to [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]], though it included lesser spirits. They had also [[totemism]], but this was a minor aspect of their religion and hence a corrective to Durkheim's generalizations should be made. Evans-Pritchard did not propose a theory of religion''s'', but only a theory of the Nuer religion.

===Clifford Geertz===
The [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Clifford Geertz]] (1926–2006) made several studies in [[Java]]nese villages. He avoided the subjective and vague concept of group [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]] as used by [[Ruth Benedict]] by using the analysis of society as proposed by [[Talcott Parsons]] who in turn had adapted it from [[Max Weber]].&lt;ref name="Pals, page 239"/&gt; Parsons' adaptation distinguished all human groups on three levels i.e. ''1.'' an individual level that is controlled by ''2.'' a [[social system]] that is in turn controlled by ''3.'' a [[cultural system]].&lt;ref name="Pals, page 239"/&gt; Geertz followed Weber when he wrote that "man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun and the analysis of it to be therefore not an experimental science in search of law but an interpretive one in search of meaning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/01/obituaries/01geertz.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin | title=Clifford Geertz, Cultural Anthropologist, Is Dead at 80 | accessdate=2008-03-14 | first=Andrew L. | last=Yarrow |date=November 1, 2006 | journal=New York Times: Obituaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geertz held the view that mere explanations to describe religions and cultures are not sufficient: interpretations are needed too. He advocated what he called ''[[thick description]]s'' to interpret symbols by observing them in use, and for this work, he was known as a founder of symbolic anthropology. 

Geertz saw religion as one of the [[cultural system]]s of a society. He defined religion as 
:(1) a system of symbols
:(2) which acts to establish powerful, pervasive and long-lasting moods and motivations in men
:(3) by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and
:(4) clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that
:(5) the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic.&lt;ref name="Kunin, page 153"&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With symbols Geertz meant a carrier that embodies a conception, because he saw religion and culture as systems of communication.&lt;ref name="Kunin, page 153"/&gt;

This definition emphasizes the mutual reinforcement between [[world view]] and [[ethos]].
&lt;!-- WHAT DOES EACH POINT THIS DEFINITION MEAN? SOURCES: PALSE AND KUNIN --&gt;

Though he used more or less the same methodology as Evans-Pritchard, he did not share Evans-Pritchard's hope that a theory of religion could ever be found. Geertz proposed methodology was not the [[scientific method]] of the [[natural science]], but [[Historical method|the method of historians studying history]].

==Functional theories==

===Karl Marx===
[[Image:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) ]]
{{main|Marxism and religion}}
The social philosopher [[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) held a [[Historical materialism|materialist]] worldview.
According to Marx, the dynamics of society were determined by the [[relations of production]], that is, the relations that its members needed to enter into to produce their means of survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing on the ideas of [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], he saw religion as a product of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] that was functional to [[opium of the people|relieving people's immediate suffering]], and as an ideology that masked the real nature of social relations.
He deemed it a contingent part of human culture, that would have disappeared after the abolition of class society.

These claims were limited, however, to his analysis of the historical relationship between European cultures, political institutions, and their Christian religious traditions.
&lt;!--WHAT IS FALSE CONSCIOUSNESS AND HOW IS IT RELATED TO RELIGION? (Pals) --&gt;

Marxist views strongly influenced individuals' comprehension and conclusions about society, among others the anthropological school of [[cultural materialism (anthropology)|cultural materialism]].

Marx' explanations for all religions, always, in all forms, and everywhere have never been taken seriously by many experts in the field, though a substantial fraction accept that Marx' views possibly explain some aspects of religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|loc=Conclusion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some recent work has suggested that, while the standard account of Marx's analysis of religion is true, it is also only one side of a dialectical account, which takes seriously the disruptive, as well as the passifying moments of religion &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McKinnon | first=AM | year=2005 | title=Reading ‘Opium of the People’: Expression, Protest and the Dialectics of Religion | journal=Critical Sociology | volume= 31 | number=No. 1-2 | pages=15–38 | url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3074/1/marx_religion_and_opium_final_author_version.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sigmund Freud===
[[File:Freud 1885.jpg|thumb|200px|Sigmund Freud, 1885]]
{{main|Freud and religion|The Future of an Illusion|Totem and Taboo|Moses and Monotheism|Oedipus complex}}
[[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939) saw religion as an [[The Future of an Illusion|illusion]], a belief that people very much wanted to be true. Unlike Tylor and Frazer, Freud attempted to explain why religion persists in spite of the lack of evidence for its tenets. Freud asserted that religion is a largely [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] [[Neurosis|neurotic]] response to [[Psychological repression|repression]]. By repression Freud meant that civilized society demands that we not fulfill all our desires immediately, but that they have to be repressed. Rational arguments to a person holding a religious conviction will not change the neurotic response of a person. This is in contrast to Tylor and Frazer, who saw religion as a rational and conscious, though primitive and mistaken, attempt to explain the natural world.

In his 1913 book ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' he developed a speculative story about how all [[monotheism|monotheist religions]] originated and developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book he asserted that monotheistic religions grew out of a homicide in a clan of a father by his sons. This incident was subconsciously remembered in human societies.

In ''[[Moses and Monotheism]]'', Freud proposed that Moses had been a priest of [[Akhenaten]] who fled Egypt after the pharaoh's death and perpetuated monotheism through a different religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | first=S | last=Freud | encyclopedia=The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud | volume=Volume XXIII (1937{{ndash}}1939) | title=Moses and monotheism | location=London | publisher=[[Hogarth Press]] | year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud's view on religion was embedded in his larger theory of [[psychoanalysis]], [[Psychoanalysis#Scientific criticism|which has been criticized as unscientific]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Freud's attempt to explain the historical [[origin of religion|origins of religions]] have not been accepted, his generalized view that all religions originate from unfulfilled psychological needs is still seen as offering a credible explanation in some cases.{{sfn|Pals|1996|loc=Conclusion|pp=280–281}}
{{see also|Psychology of religion#Sigmund Freud|}}

===Émile Durkheim===
[[Image:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917)]]

[[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917) saw the [[Sacred-profane dichotomy|concept of the sacred]] as the defining characteristic of religion, not faith in the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw religion as a reflection of the concern for society. He based his view on recent research regarding [[totemism]] among the [[Australian aboriginals]]. With [[totemism]] he meant that each of the many clans had a different object, plant, or animal that they held sacred and that symbolizes the clan. Durkheim saw [[totemism]] as the original and simplest form of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Durkheim, the analysis of this simple form of religion could provide the building blocks for more complex religions. He asserted that moralism cannot be separated from religion. The sacred i.e. religion reinforces group interest that clash very often with individual interests. Durkheim held the view that the function of religion is group cohesion often performed by collectively attended rituals. He asserted that these group meeting provided a special kind of energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McKinnon | first=A | year=2014 | title=Elementary Forms of the Metaphorical Life: Tropes at Work in Durkheim’s Theory of the Religious | journal=Journal of Classical Sociology | volume= 14 | number=No. 2 | pages=203–221 | url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3284/1/elementary_metaphors_of_the_religious_life_author_version_doc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he called [[collective effervescence|effervescence]], that made group members lose their individuality and to feel united with the gods and thus with the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differing from Tylor and Frazer, he saw magic not as religious, but as an individual instrument to achieve something.

Durkheim's proposed method for progress and refinement is first to carefully study religion in its simplest form in one contemporary society and then the same in another society and compare the religions then and only between societies that are the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--WHAT IS THE FUNCTION OF ASCETICISM? SOURCE Pals--&gt;
&lt;!--WHAT ARE THE ELEMENTARY FORMS OF PRIMITIVE RELIGION THAT ARE ALSO PRESENT IN MORE COMPLEX RELIGIONS? SOURCE PALS --&gt;
The empirical basis for Durkheim's view has been severely criticized when more detailed studies of the Australian aboriginals surfaced. More specifically, the definition of religion as dealing with the sacred only, regardless of the supernatural, is not supported by studies of these aboriginals. The view that religion has a social aspect, at the very least, introduced in a generalized very strong form by Durkheim has become influential and uncontested.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim's approach gave rise to [[functionalism (sociology)|functionalist school in sociology and anthropology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Functionalism is a sociological paradigm that originally attempted to explain social institutions as collective means to fill individual biological needs, focusing on the ways in which social institutions fill social needs, especially social stability. Thus because Durkheim viewed society as an "organismic analogy of the body, wherein all the parts work together to maintain the equilibrium of the whole, religion was understood to be the glue that held society together.".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Christiano|Swatos|Kivisto|2008|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{see also|Sacred-profane dichotomy|Collective effervescence}}

===Bronisław Malinowski===
The anthropologist [[Bronisław Malinowski]] (1884–1942) was strongly influenced by the functionalist school and argued that religion originated from coping with [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strenski2006p269&gt;{{harvnb|Strenski|2006|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw science as practical knowledge that every society needs abundantly to survive and magic as related to this practical knowledge, but generally dealing with phenomena that humans cannot control.

===Max Weber===
[[Image:Max Weber 1894.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Max Weber]]]]
{{main|Sociology of Religion (book)|Charismatic authority|The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism|The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism|The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism|Three-component theory of stratification}}
[[Max Weber]] (1864–1920) thought that the truth claims of religious movement were irrelevant for the scientific study of the movements.&lt;ref name="hirr.hartsem.edu"/&gt; He portrayed each religion as rational and consistent in their respective societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Weber acknowledged that religion had a strong social component, but diverged from Durkheim by arguing, for example in his book  [[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]] that religion can be a force of change in society. In the book Weber wrote that modern [[capitalism]] spread quickly partially due to the Protestant worldly ascetic morale.&lt;ref name="hirr.hartsem.edu"/&gt; Weber's main focus was not on developing a theory of religion but on the interaction between society and religion, while introducing concepts that are still widely used in the [[sociology of religion]]. These concept include
* [[Church sect typology]], Weber distinguished between [[sect]]s and churches by stating that membership of a sect is a personal choice and church membership is determined by birth. The typology later developed more extensively by his friend [[Ernst Troeltsch]] and others.&lt;ref name="Bendix49-50"&gt;{{harvnb|Bendix|1977|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the typology, churches, [[Ecclesia (sociology of religion)|ecclesia]], [[Religious denomination|denomination]], and [[sect]]s form a continuum with decreasing influence on society. Sects are protest break away groups and tend to be in tension with society.
* [[Ideal type]], a hypothetical "pure" or "clear" form, used in [[Typification|typologies]]
* [[Charismatic authority]] Weber saw charisma as a volatile form or authority that depends on the acceptance of unique quality of a person by this person's followers. Charisma can be a revolutionary force and the authority can either be [[Charismatic authority#Routinizing charisma|routinized]] (change into [[Tripartite classification of authority|other forms of authority]]) or disappear upon the death of the charismatic person.&lt;ref name="hirr.hartsem.edu"/&gt;

Somewhat differing from Marx, Weber dealt with [[status group]]s, not with [[Social class|class]]. In status groups the primary motivation is prestige and [[social cohesion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Status groups have differing levels of access to power and prestige and indirectly to economic resources. In [[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism|his 1920 treatment of the religion in China]] he saw [[Confucianism]] as helping a certain status group, i.e. the educated elite to maintain access to prestige and power. He asserted that Confucianism opposition against both extravagance and thrift made it unlikely that capitalism could have originated in China.

He used the concept of ''[[Verstehen#Weber and the social sciences|Verstehen]]'' (German for "understanding") to describe his method of interpretation of the intention and context of human action.&lt;ref name="Pals, page 239"&gt;{{harvnb|Pals|1996|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{see also|Sociological classifications of religious movements#The church-sect typology|Sociology of religion#Max_Weber}}

===Rational choice theory===
{{main|Theory of religious economy}}
The [[rational choice theory]] has been applied to religions, among others by the sociologists [[Rodney Stark]] (1934 – ) and [[William Sims Bainbridge]] (1940 – ).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; They see religions as systems of "compensators",  and view human beings as "rational actors, making choices that she or he thinks best, calculating costs and benefits".&lt;ref&gt;The quote is from {{harvnb|Christiano|Swatos|Kivisto|2008|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{harvnb|Nauta|1998|loc=Stark, Rodney}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compensators are a body of language and practices that compensate for some physical lack or frustrated goal. They can be divided into specific compensators (compensators for the failure to achieve specific goals), and general compensators (compensators for failure to achieve any goal).&lt;ref name="http"/&gt; They define religion as a system of compensation that relies on the [[supernatural]].&lt;ref name="Kunin, page 85"&gt;{{harvnb|Kunin|2003|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main reasoning behind this theory is that the compensation is what controls the choice, or in other words the choices which the "rational actors" make are "rational in the sense that they are centered on the satisfaction of wants".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Christiano|Swatos|Kivisto|2008|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been observed that social or political movements that fail to achieve their goals will often transform into religions. As it becomes clear that the goals of the movement will not be achieved by natural means (at least within their lifetimes), members of the movement will look to the supernatural to achieve what cannot be achieved naturally. The new religious beliefs are compensators for the failure to achieve the original goals. Examples of this include the [[counterculture]] movement in America: the early counterculture movement was intent on changing society and removing its injustice and boredom; but as members of the movement proved unable to achieve these goals they turned to Eastern and new religions as compensators.

Most religions start out their lives as [[cult]]s or [[sect]]s, i.e. groups in high tension with the surrounding society, containing different views and beliefs contrary to the societal norm. Over time, they tend to either die out, or become more established, mainstream and in less tension with society. Cults are new groups with a new novel [[theology]], while sects are attempts to return mainstream religions to (what the sect views as) their original purity. Mainstream established groups are called [[Religious denomination|denomination]]s. The comments below about cult formation apply equally well to sect formation.

There are four models of cult formation: the [[psychopathology|Psychopathological]] Model, the Entrepreneurial Model, the Social Model and the Normal [[Revelation]]s model.
*'''Psychopathological model''': religions are founded during a period of severe stress in the life of the founder. The founder suffers from psychological problems, which they resolve through the founding of the religion. (The development of the religion is for them a form of self-therapy, or self-medication.)
*'''Entrepreneurial model''': founders of religions act like entrepreneurs, developing new products (religions) to sell to consumers (to convert people to). According to this model, most founders of new religions already have experience in several religious groups before they begin their own. They take ideas from the pre-existing religions, and try to improve on them to make them more popular.
*'''Social model:''' religions are founded by means of [[social implosion]]s. Members of the religious group spend less and less time with people outside the group, and more and more time with each other within it. The level of affection and emotional bonding between members of a group increases, and their emotional bonds to members outside the group diminish. According to the social model, when a social implosion occurs, the group will naturally develop a new theology and rituals to accompany it.
*'''Normal revelations''': religions are founded when the founder interprets ordinary natural phenomena as supernatural; for instance, ascribing his or her own creativity in inventing the religion to that of the deity.
Some religions are better described by one model than another, though all apply to differing degrees to all religions.

Once a cult or sect has been founded, the next problem for the founder is to convert new members to it. Prime candidates for [[religious conversion]] are those with an openness to religion, but who do not belong or fit well in any existing religious group. Those with no religion or no interest in religion are difficult to convert, especially since the cult and sect beliefs are so extreme by the standards of the surrounding society. But those already happy members of a religious group are difficult to convert as well, since they have strong social links to their preexisting religion and are unlikely to want to sever them in order to join a new one. The best candidates for religious conversion are those who are members of or have been associated with religious groups (thereby showing an interest or openness to religion), yet exist on the fringe of these groups, without strong social ties to prevent them from joining a new group.

Potential converts vary in their level of social connection. [[New religious movement|New religions]] best spread through pre-existing friendship networks. Converts who are marginal with few friends are easy to convert, but having few friends to convert they cannot add much to the further growth of the organization. Converts with a large social network are harder to convert, since they tend to have more invested in mainstream society; but once converted they yield many new followers through their friendship network.

Cults initially can have quite high growth rates; but as the social networks that initially feed them are exhausted, their growth rate falls quickly. On the other hand, the rate of [[exponential growth|growth is exponential]] (ignoring the limited supply of potential converts): the more converts you have, the more missionaries you can have out looking for new converts. But nonetheless it can take a very long time for religions to grow to a large size by natural growth. This often leads to cult leaders giving up after several decades, and withdrawing the cult from the world.

It is difficult for cults and sects to maintain their initial enthusiasm for more than about a generation. As children are born into the cult or sect, members begin to demand a more stable life. When this happens, cults tend to lose or de-emphasise many of their more radical beliefs, and become more open to the surrounding society; they then become [[Religious denomination|denomination]]s.

The [[theory of religious economy]] sees different [[religious organizations]] competing for followers in a religious economy, much like the way [[business]]es compete for consumers in a commercial [[economy]]. Theorists assert that a true religious economy is the result of [[religious pluralism]], giving the population a wider variety of choices in religion. According to the theory, the more [[religion]]s there are, the more likely the population is to be religious and hereby contradicting the [[Secularization|secularization thesis]].

The '''trivium''' is the lower division of the [[seven liberal arts]] and comprises [[grammar]], [[dialectic]], and [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref name="english-ety"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology |editor1=Onions, C.T. |year=1991 |page=944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trivium is implicit in ''De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii'' ("On the Marriage of Philology and Mercury") by [[Martianus Capella]], but the term was not used until the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], when it was coined in imitation of the earlier [[quadrivium]].&lt;ref&gt;Marrou, Henri-Irénée (1969). "Les arts libéraux dans l'Antiquité classique". pp. 6–27 in ''Arts libéraux et philosophie au Moyen Âge''. Paris: Vrin; Montréal: Institut d'études médiévales). pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Grammar, logic, and rhetoric were essential to a classical education, as explained in [[Plato]]'s dialogues. The three subjects together were denoted by the word ''trivium'' during the [[Middle Ages]], but the tradition of first learning those three subjects was established in [[Education in ancient Greece|ancient Greece]]. Contemporary iterations have taken various forms, including those found in certain British and American universities (some being part of the [[Classical education movement]]) and at the independent [[Oundle School]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.martinrobinson.net/writing.html. Each of these iterations was discussed in a conference at King's College London on the future of the liberal arts at schools and universities; see http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/liberal/conference.aspx and http://www.boarding.org.uk/media/news/article/2352/Oundle-School-Improving-Intellectual-Challenge&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Etymologically, the Latin word '''trivium''' means "the place where three roads meet" (tri + via); hence, the subjects of the trivium are the foundation for the [[quadrivium]], the upper division of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] education in the [[liberal arts]], which comprised [[arithmetic]] (number), [[geometry]] (number in space), [[music]] (number in time), and [[astronomy]] (number in space and time). Educationally, the trivium and the quadrivium imparted to the student the seven liberal arts of [[classical antiquity]].&lt;ref name="english-ety" /&gt;

== Description ==

'''[[Grammar]]''' teaches the mechanics of language to the student. This is the step where the student "comes to terms," defining the objects and information perceived by the five senses. Hence, the [[Law of Identity]]: ''a tree is a tree, and not a cat''.

'''[[Logic]]''' (also [[dialectic]]) is the "mechanics" of [[thought]] and of [[analysis]], the process of identifying [[Fallacy|fallacious arguments]] and statements and so systematically removing contradictions, thereby producing factual knowledge that can be trusted.

'''[[Rhetoric]]''' is the application of language in order to instruct and to persuade the listener and the reader. It is the knowledge (grammar) now understood (logic) and being transmitted outwards as wisdom (rhetoric).

[[Sister Miriam Joseph]], in ''The Trivium: The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric'' (2002), described the trivium as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Grammar is the art of inventing symbols and combining them to express thought; logic is the art of thinking; and rhetoric is the art of communicating thought from one mind to another, the adaptation of language to circumstance.

'''. . .'''

Grammar is concerned with the thing as-it-is-symbolized. Logic is concerned with the thing as-it-is-known. Rhetoric is concerned with the thing as-it-is-communicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Joseph |first=Sister Miriam |title=The Trivium: The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric |publisher=Paul Dry Books |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lg0a-RJcn4gC&amp;pg=PA3 |pages=3, 9 |chapter=1, The Liberal Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John Ayto wrote in the ''Dictionary of Word Origins'' (1990) that study of the trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) was requisite preparation for study of the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy). For the medieval student, the trivium was the curricular beginning of the acquisition of the seven [[liberal arts]]; as such, it was the principal undergraduate course of study. The word ''[[wikt:trivial|trivial]]'' arose from the contrast between the simpler trivium and the more difficult quadrivium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ayto |first=John |title=Dictionary of Word Origins |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1990 |page=542 |isbn=1-55970-214-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Speculum 74v.jpg|thumb|The [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]] from a ''[[Speculum Humanae Salvationis]]'' c. 1430, see below.]]
'''Typology'''  in [[Christian theology]] and Biblical [[exegesis]] is a doctrine or theory concerning the [[Old Testament#Relationship between Old and New Testament|relationship of the Old Testament to the New Testament]].   Events, persons, or statements in the [[Old Testament]] are seen as '''types''' pre-figuring or superseded by '''antitypes''', events or aspects of [[Christ (title)|Christ]] or his revelation described in the [[New Testament]]. For example, [[Jonah]] may be seen as the '''type''' of Christ in that he emerged from the fish's belly and thus appeared to rise from death.  In the fullest version of the theory of typology, the whole purpose of the Old Testament is viewed as merely the provision of types for Christ, the antitype or fulfillment. The theory began in the [[Early Church]], was at its most influential in the [[High Middle Ages]], and continued to be popular, especially in [[Calvinism]], after the [[Protestant Reformation]], but in subsequent periods has been given less emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiancourier.com/articles/126-a-study-of-biblical-typology A Study of Biblical Typology] (Wayne Jackson, ''Christian Courier'')&lt;/ref&gt; One exception to this is the [[Christian Brethren]] of the 19th and 20th centuries, where typology was much favoured and the subject of numerous books. Notably, in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], typology is still a common and frequent exegetical tool, mainly due to that church's great emphasis on continuity in doctrinal presentation through all historical periods. Typology was frequently used in early Christian art, where type and antitype would be depicted in contrasting positions. The usage of the terminology has expanded into the secular sphere; for example, "[[Geoffrey de Montbray]] (d.1093), [[Bishop of Coutances]], a right-hand man of [[William the Conqueror]], was a type of the great [[feudal]] prelate, warrior and administrator".&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term is derived from the Greek noun τύπος (''typos''), "a blow, hitting, stamp", and thus the figure or impression made on a coin by such action; that is, an image, figure, or statue of a man; also an original pattern, model, or mould. To this is prefixed the Greek preposition ἀντί ''anti'', meaning opposite, corresponding.&lt;ref&gt;''Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon'', Oxford 1871.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Latin ''figura'', meaning form, shape, or figure, may be comparable, but is from the less violent verb ''fingo, finxi, fictum'', to fashion, form, or mould (Cassell's Latin Dictionary)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the theory==
Christian typology begins in the New Testament itself. For example, [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 5.14 calls [[Adam]] "a type [τύπος] of the one who was to come" — i.e., a type of [[Jesus of Nazareth|Christ]]. He contrasts Adam and Christ both in Romans 5 and in [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] 15. The author of the [[First Epistle of Peter]] uses the term ἀντίτυπον (''antitypon'') to refer to baptism&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Peter|3:21|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There are also typological concepts in pre-Pauline strata of the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;E. Earle Ellis, 1957, ''Paul’s Use of the Old Testament''. Edinburgh; London: Oliver and Boyd.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early Christians, in considering the Old Testament, needed to decide what its role and purpose was for them, given that Christian revelation and the [[New Covenant]] might be considered to have [[Supersessionism|superseded]] it, and many specific Old Testament rules and requirements were no longer being followed from books such as  [[Leviticus]] dealing with [[Expounding of the Law]].&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Leviticus 18]]&lt;/ref&gt;  One purpose of the Old Testament for Christians was to demonstrate that the [[Ministry of Jesus]] and Christ's first coming had been prophesied and foreseen, and the [[Gospel]]s indeed contain many [[Jesus and Messianic prophecy|Old Testament prophecies fulfilled by Christ]] and [[Quotations from the Old Testament in the New Testament|quotations from the Old Testament]] which explicitly and implicitly link Jesus to Old Testament prophecies. Typology greatly extended the number of these links by adding others based on the similarity of Old Testament actions or situations to an aspect of Christ.

Typology is also a theory of [[history]], seeing the whole story of the Jewish and Christian peoples as shaped by God, with events within the story acting as symbols for later events. In this role, God is often compared to a writer, using actual events instead of fiction to shape his narrative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/TYPE.HTM Typology] Washington State University&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of typology==
{{Refimprove|date=April 2016}}
The system of [[Medieval allegory]] began in the Early Church as a method for synthesizing the seeming discontinuities between the [[Hebrew Bible]] (Old Testament) and the New Testament. The Church studied both testaments and saw each as equally [[Biblical inspiration|inspired]] by [[God]], yet the Old Testament contained discontinuities for Christians such as the Jewish [[kosher]] laws and [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|the requirement for male circumcision]].  This therefore encouraged seeing at least parts of the Old Testament not as a literal account but as an [[allegory]] or foreshadowing of the events of the New Testament, and in particular examining how the events of the Old Testament related to the events of Christ's life.  Most theorists believed in the literal truth of the Old Testament accounts, but regarded the events described as shaped by God to provide types foreshadowing Christ. Others regarded some parts of the Bible as essentially allegorical; however, the typological relationships remained the same whichever view was taken.  [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] states the doctrine in [[Colossians]] 2:16-17 - "Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a [[Biblical sabbath|sabbath day]]. These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ." The idea also finds expression in the [[Letter to the Hebrews]].

The development of this systematic view of the [[Hebrew Bible]] was influenced by the thought of the [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenistic Jewish]] world centered in [[Alexandria]], where Jewish philosopher [[Philo]] (c. 20 BC – c. 50 AD) and others viewed Scripture in philosophical terms (contemporary Greek literary theory highlighted [[foreshadowing]] as a literary device) as essentially an allegory, using Hellenistic [[Platonism|Platonic]] concepts. [[Origen]] (184/185{{snd}}253/254) Christianised the system, and figures including [[Hilary of Poitiers]] (c. 300{{snd}}c. 368) and [[Ambrose]] (c. 340{{snd}}397) spread it.  [[Saint Augustine]] (345–430) recalled often hearing Ambrose say that "the letter kills but the spirit gives life", and Augustine in turn became a hugely influential proponent of the system, though also insisting on the literal historical truth of the Bible. [[Isidore of Seville]] (c. 560-636) and [[Rabanus Maurus]] (c. 780-856) became influential as summarizers and compilers of works setting out standardized interpretations of correspondences and their meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Emile Male, ''The Gothic Image, Religious Art in France of the Thirteenth Century'', p 131-9, English translation of 3rd edition, 1913, Collins, London, {{ISBN|978-0064300322}} (and many other editions)&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish typological thought continued to develop in [[Rabbinic literature]], including the [[Kabbalah]], with concepts such as the [[Pardes (Jewish exegesis)|Pardes]], the four approaches to a Biblical text.

[[File:Speculum75R.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jacob's Ladder]] from a ''[[Speculum Humanae Salvationis]]'' c. 1430, pre-figuring the Ascension above]]

Typology frequently emerged in art; many typological pairings appear in sculpture on cathedrals and churches and in other media.  Popular illustrated works expounding typological couplings were among the commonest books of the late Middle Ages, as [[illuminated manuscripts]], [[blockbooks]], and [[incunabula]] (early printed books).  The ''[[Speculum Humanae Salvationis]]'' and the ''[[Biblia pauperum]]'' became the two most successful compilations.

===Example of Jonah===
The story of [[Jonah]] and the fish in the Old Testament offers an example of typology. In the Old Testament [[Book of Jonah]], Jonah told his shipmates to throw him overboard, explaining that God's wrath would pass if Jonah were sacrificed, and that the sea would become calm. Jonah then spent three days and three nights in the belly of a great fish before it spat him up onto dry land.

Typological interpretation of this story holds that it prefigures Christ's burial and resurrection. The stomach of the fish represented Christ's tomb; as Jonah exited from the fish after three days and three nights, so did Christ rise from His tomb on the third day.  In the New Testament, Jesus invokes Jonah in the manner of a type: "As the crowds increased, Jesus said, 'This is a wicked generation. It asks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.'" {{bibleverse||Luke|11:29–32}} (see also {{bibleverse||Matthew|12:38–42}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|16:1–4}}). In {{bibleverse|Jonah|2|HE}}, Jonah called the belly of the fish "[[Sheol|She'ol]]", the land of the dead (translated as "the grave" in the [[New International Version|NIV]] Bible).

Thus, when one finds an allusion to Jonah in [[Medieval art]] or in [[Medieval literature]], it usually represents an allegory for the burial and resurrection of Christ. Other common typological allegories entail the four major Old Testament prophets [[Isaiah]], [[Jeremiah]], [[Ezekiel]], and [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] prefiguring the four Evangelists [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]], [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]], and [[John the Evangelist|John]], or the twelve tribes of Israel foreshadowing the twelve [[apostles]]. Commentators could find countless numbers of analogies between stories of the Old Testament and the New; modern typologists prefer to limit themselves to considering typological relationships that they find sanctioned in the New Testament itself, as in the example of Jonah above.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, see above&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Old Testament examples==
[[File:Bloch-SermonOnTheMount.jpg|thumb|right|Christians believe that Jesus is the mediator of the New Covenant.&lt;ref&gt;for example {{bible verse||Hebrews|8:6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Sermon on the Mount]] he [[Expounding of the Law|commented on the Law]]. Some scholars [[Expounding of the Law#Antithesis of the Law|consider this]] to be an '''antitype''' of the proclamation of the [[Ten Commandments]] or [[Mosaic Covenant]] by [[Moses]] from [[Biblical Mount Sinai|mount Sinai]].]]

===Offering of Isaac===
Genesis Chapter 22 brings us the story of the preempted offering of Isaac. God asks Abraham to offer his son Isaac to Him, cited as foreshadowing the crucifixion of Jesus. Isaac asks his father, “Where is the lamb for the burnt offering”, and Abraham prophesies, "God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son." And indeed, a ram caught by its horns awaits them, which is also seen as a type for Christ, the [[Lamb of God|lamb that God provides]] for sacrifice, [[Crown of Thorns|crowned by thorns]].

===Joseph===
Genesis Chapters 37-50 has the story of Joseph in Egypt, and Joseph is commonly cited as a Christ type.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learnthebible.org/L-023_joseph_sold_into_slavery.htm Learn the bible site]&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph is a very special son to his father. From his father’s perspective, Joseph dies and then comes back to life as the ruler of Egypt. Joseph’s brothers deceive their father by dipping his coat in the blood of a sacrificed goat (Genesis 37:31).  Later, Joseph’s father finds that Joseph is alive and is the ruler of Egypt who saves the world from a great famine. Other parallels between Joseph and Jesus include:
* both are rejected by their own people
* both became servants
* both are betrayed for silver
* both are falsely accused and face false witnesses
* both attain stations at the "right hand" of the respective thrones (Joseph at Pharaoh's throne and Christ at the throne of God)
*Joseph was 30 years old when he stood before Pharaoh, and Jesus was about the same age according to the bible when he began his ministry 
*Money and goods were not able to save the people in time of famine, they had to sell themselves, the same notions are discussed throughout the new testment.  
* both provided for the salvation of gentiles,  (Joseph provided a physical salvation in preparing for the famine, while Christ provided the deeper spiritual salvation)
* Joseph married an Egyptian wife, bringing her into the Abrahamic lineage; Christ's relationship with the church is also described in marriage terms in the New Testament
*A direct parallel with Joseph ruling over all of Egypt, and that only Pharaoh would greater in the throne is repeated in 1 Corinthians 15:27 with regards to Jesus 
*Both suffered greatly, and through patience and humbleness were exalted greatly by God, who gave in abundance all things over time.

===Moses===
Moses, like Joseph and Jonah, undergoes a symbolic death and resurrection. Moses is placed in a basket and floated down the Nile river, and then is drawn out of the Nile to be adopted as a prince (floating the body down the Nile river was also part of an [[Ancient Egyptian burial customs|Egyptian funerary ritual]] for royalty).&lt;ref&gt;Burial customs [http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/egypt/giza/boat/boat.html] [http://www.carnegiemnh.org/exhibits/egypt/guide.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

While in the wilderness, [[Moses]] put a brazen serpent on a pole which would heal anyone bitten by a snake, provided that the person looked at it (Numbers 21:8). Jesus proclaimed that the serpent was a type of Himself: "as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up" (John 3:14).

In a battle with the Amalekites, [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 17:11 states that "as long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning." Commentators{{citation needed|reason=Such as?|date=April 2016}} interpret Moses' raised hands as a type of Jesus' raised hands upon the Cross for, when Jesus' hands were raised as He died, a figurative battle was waged with sin, the end result being victory - that "all will be made alive" (1 Cor. 15:22).

===Inanimate types===
Other types were found in aspects of the Old Testament less tied to specific events.  The [[Jewish holiday]]s also have typological fulfillment in the life of Christ.  The [[Last Supper]] was a [[Passover]] meal.  Furthermore, many people{{citation needed|reason=Such as?|date=April 2016}} see the Spring Feasts as types of what Christ accomplished in his first advent and the Fall Feasts as types of what Christ will accomplish in his second advent.

The Jewish [[Tabernacle]] is commonly seen as a series of complex types of [[Jesus Christ]]. For example, Jesus describes himself as "the door"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:9;&amp;version=9; John 10:9]&lt;/ref&gt; and the only "way" to God,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2014:6;&amp;version=9; John14:6]&lt;/ref&gt; represented in the single, wide gate to the tabernacle court; the various layers of coverings over the tabernacle represent Christ's godliness (in the intricately woven inner covering) and his humanity (in the dull colouring of the outside covering).&lt;ref&gt;CH Raven, ''God's Sanctuary'', John Ritchie Ltd., 1991, {{ISBN|978-0-946351-31-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Showbread]] prepared in the [[Temple of Jerusalem]] is also seen as a type for Christ.{{citation needed|reason=Such as?|date=April 2016}}

==Post-biblical usage==
As [[Erich Auerbach]] points out in his essay "Figura", typological (figural) interpretation co-existed alongside allegorical and symbolic-mythical forms of interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach, Erich. "Figura". pp.54-57.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was typology that was most influential as Christianity spread in late Mediterranean cultures, as well as in the North and Western European cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach p.58&lt;/ref&gt; Auerbach notes that it was the predominant method of understanding the Hebrew scriptures until after the Reformation—that is, that the Hebrew texts were ''not'' understood as Jewish history and law but were instead interpreted "as ''figura rerum'' or phenomenal prophecy, as a prefiguration of Christ".&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach p.53&lt;/ref&gt; Typological interpretation was a key element of Medieval realism, but remained important in Europe "up to the eighteenth century".&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach p.61&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, typology was extended beyond interpretations of the Hebrew scriptures and applied to post-Biblical events, seeing them as "not the ultimate fulfillment, but [...] a promise of the end of time and the true kingdom of God."&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach p.58.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Puritans interpreted their own history typologically:&lt;ref&gt;See for instance, [[Sacvan Bercovitch]], ''Typology and Early American Literature'', U Mass Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Applied more liberally and figured more broadly, typology expanded into a more elaborate verbal system that enabled an interpreter to discover biblical forecasts of current events.  Thus, the Atlantic journey of the Puritans could be an antitype of the Exodus of the Israelites; and the New England colony, a New Zion, to which Christ may return to usher in the Millennium.  The first settlers were conservative, cautious typologists, but as Edward Johnson's Wonder-Working Providence of Sion's Saviour in New England (1654; composed c. 1650) demonstrates, by the 1640s New England's sacred errand into the wilderness and the approaching Apocalypse were accepted antitypes of sacred history.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emory Elliott]], "New England Puritan Literature" p.188 at [http://www.wsu.edu/~campbelld/amlit/typology.htm Donna Campbell's American Literature site at WSU]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In this way, the Puritans applied typology both to themselves as a group and to the progress of the individual souls: {{cquote|Applied more broadly, typology enabled Puritans to read biblical types as forecasting not just the events of the New Testament but also their own historical situation and experiences. In this way, individual Puritans could make sense of their own spiritual struggles and achievements by identifying with biblical personages like Adam, Noah, or Job. But this broad understanding of typology was not restricted to individual typing; the Puritans also interpreted their group identity as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, identifying their community as the "New Israel."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learner.org/amerpass/unit03/glossary.html American Passages Unit 3 Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Typology also became important as a literary device, in which both historical and literary characters become prefigurations of later historical or literary characters.&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach's essay treats of figuration in [[Dante]]. For a collection of essays on this topic, see [[Earl Miner]], ''Literary Uses of Typology from the Late Middle Ages to the Present'', Princeton U Press, 1977. Of especial interest in this volume are Robert Hollander's essay "Typology and Secular Literature: Some Medieval Problems and Examples" (pp.3-19) and [[Barbara Kiefer Lewalski]]'s "Typological Symbolism and the 'Progress of the Soul' in Seventeenth-Century Literature" (pp.79-114).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''William Phelps Ornithological Collection,''' also known as the Phelps Ornithological Museum, is a museum of [[Natural science|natural sciences]] dedicated to the study, exhibition and preservation of the [[Bird|birds]] of [[Venezuela]] and the rest of Latin America. The collection is located east of Caracas and in the geographic center of [[Metropolitan Region of Caracas|Greater Caracas]], in the heart of the [[Sabana Grande, Caracas|Sabana Grande district]]. The William Phelps ornithological collection is the most important in [[Latin America]] and it is also the most important private collection in the world in its research area.&lt;ref name=":282"&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.avibushistoriae.com/Obituary%20Phelps%20figlio.pdf|title=IN MEMORIAM: WILLIAM H. PHELPS JR.|last=VUILLEUMIER|first=FRANCOIS|date=1990|journal=Department of Ornithology, The American Museum of Natural Histor|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In this private museum one will find important Phelps family study books, as well as 8000 scientific volumes in the library,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|author=Marcos Kirschstein y José Daniel Ramos|title=El bulevar de Sabana Grande esconde un misterio de ochenta años|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/videos/cultura/bulevar-sabana-grande-esconde-misterio-ochenta-anos_69876|date=2018-01-29|accessdate=2018-05-29|work=El Nacional|location=|page=|number=|Apellido 2=}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than 83,000 anatomical specimens, more than 80,000 skins, etc.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;  For the year 1990, it was said that the William Phelps Ornithological Collection contained more than 76,300 skins and a small number of anatomical specimens, in the Gran Sabana Building of [[Sabana Grande, Caracas|Sabana Grande]]. The Phelps library in 1990 already had 6,000 books, 800 journals and 5,500 reprints, mostly from natural sciences.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;
 
== History ==

The ornithological collection was born in 1938, although it did not have its own headquarters on the [[Boulevard of Sabana Grande]] until 1949. At the beginning of 2018, it celebrated its 80th anniversary in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the passing of time, the collection has been growing&lt;ref name=":282" /&gt; and still has great international scientific relevance. In 2005, an investigation was carried out on "plumage differences in four subspecies of golden warbler Basileuterus culicivorus in [[Venezuela]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.neotropicalbirdclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/C23-Restall.pdf|title=On plumage differences in four subspecies of Golden-crowned Warbler Basileuterus culicivorus in Venezuela|last=Restall|first=Robin|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Gustavo|date=2005|journal=Cotinga|number=23|pages=33–36|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=|last3=Lentino|first3=Miguel}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Importance ===
The Phelps Foundation has been recognized worldwide for its scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fundacionwhphelps.org/web/nosotros/|title=Nosotros – Colección Ornitológica Phelps|website=fundacionwhphelps.org|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1937, this foundation has dedicated to the study of the distribution of birds in Venezuela as well as to the dissemination of ornithology in Venezuela. Since 1949, it has expanded globally in its mission to discover, interpret and disseminate information about ornithology through a program of scientific research, education and dissemination in the natural sciences. The Foundation has had an important global trajectory for which it is recognized and is a regional compulsory study resource on tropical birds for experts who want to know more about this area. This museum has historically been connected to the American Museum of Natural History, thanks to the work of Billy Phelps.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.avibushistoriae.com/Obituary%20Phelps%20figlio.pdf|title=IN MEMORIAM: WILLIAM H. PHELPS JR.|last=VUILLEUMIER|first=FRANCOIS|date=1990|journal=Department of Ornithology, The American Museum of Natural Histor|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ornithological collection has also been expanded thanks to the research carried out with Armando Dugand from [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]].&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.bdigital.unal.edu.co/33067/1/32820-121526-1-PB.pdf|title=AVES DE LA RIBERA COLOMBIANA DEL RIO NEGRO (FRONTERA DE COLOMBIA Y VENEZUELA)|last=Dugand|first=Armando|last2=Phelps|first2=William|authorlink2=|date=1948|journal=Libro|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the funds to carry out these investigations were collected by the Phelps Foundation.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt;

=== Research ===
In March and April 1977, the Phelps Ornithological Collection, with the collaboration of the Venezuelan-Brazilian Border Commission, Demarcador de Limites, carried out a collection of birds at Cerro Urutaní (62 ° 05'W, 3 ° 40'N), which is a low altitude tepui on the Venezuelan-Brazilian border in the Sierra Pacaraima. A total of 511 specimens of birds were collected between 1150 and 1280 meters high s.n.m., representing 78 different species. Gilberto Pérez Chinchilla, Manuel Castro and Dickerman prepared the copies of the collection. A full report on these birds was published in the international press and was published in the Bulletin of the "American Museum of Natural History", [[New York City|New York]]. It was necessary to work in conjunction with the Boundary Directorate of [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/Phelps%20%26%20Dickerman%201980.pdf|title=CUATRO SUBESPECIES NUEVAS DE AVES (FURNARIIDAE, FORMICARIIDAE) DE LA REGION DE PANTEPUI, ESTADO BOLIVAR Y TERRITORIO AMAZONAS, VENEZUELA|last=Phelps|first=William|last2=Robert|first2=Dickerman|date=1980|journal=Boletín de la Sociedad Venezolana de Ciencias Naturales|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14711">In [[cognitive psychology]], the '''word superiority effect''' ('''WSE''') refers to the phenomenon that people have better recognition of letters presented within words as compared to isolated letters and to letters presented within nonword (orthographically illegal, unpronounceable letter array) strings.&lt;ref name="Falikman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Falikman | first1 = M. V. | year = 2011 | title = Word superiority effects across the varieties of attention | url = | journal = Journal of Russian and East European Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 5| pages = 45–61 | doi=10.2753/rpo1061-0405490503}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also found a WSE when letter identification within words is compared to letter identification within pseudowords&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = McClelland| first = J.

The effect was first described by Cattell (1886),&lt;ref name="Cattell 1886"&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Cattell  | first = J. M.  | title = The time it takes to see and name objects  | journal = Mind  | year = 1886}}&lt;/ref&gt; and important contributions came from Reicher (1969)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Reicher  | first = G.

D.  | title = Processes in word recognition  | journal = Cognitive Psychology  | volume = 1  | issue = 1  | pages = 59–85  | year = 1970  | url = http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/32833  | accessdate = 2008-06-30  | doi = 10.1016/0010-0285(70)90005-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cattell first wrote, "I find it takes about twice as long to read...words which have no [[wikt:connexion|connexion]] as words which make sentences, and letters which have no connexions as letters which make words. When the words make sentences and the letters words, not only do the processes of seeing and naming overlap, but by one mental effort the subject can recognize a whole group of words or letters".&lt;ref name="Cattell 1886"/&gt;

G. Reicher and D. Wheeler developed the basic experimental paradigm to study the WSE, referred to as the Reicher-Wheeler paradigm. In this paradigm, an observer is presented with a word or nonword string that is followed by a mask (brief stimulus to measure effects on behavior) . The observer is then asked to name one of the letters from the cued position in that word or string making the test a [[two-alternative forced choice]] (2-AFC). For example, for the letter R in the word "card", an observer might be asked to choose between the letter R and T, and will usually be more efficient in doing so than if they are asked to make the same choice with the string of letters such as "cqrd".&lt;ref name="Falikman"/&gt; Each possible completion with the two possible letters in the word condition produce a word.

The WSE has since been exhaustively studied in the context of cognitive processes involved during [[Reading (process)|reading]]. Large amounts of research have also been done to try to model the effect using [[Connectionism|connectionist networks]].

==Experimental task==
The WSE has traditionally been tested using a [[tachistoscope]], as the durations of the letter string presentations need to be carefully controlled. Recently, stimulus presentation software has allowed much simpler manipulation of presentation durations using computers. The WSE has also been described without a tachistoscope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Prinzmetal  | first = W.  | title = The word-superiority effect does not require a T-scope  | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics  | volume = 51  | pages = 473–484  | year = 1992  | url = http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=5231389  | accessdate = 2008-06-30 | issue = 5 | doi=10.3758/bf03211643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A string of letters, usually four or five, is flashed for several milliseconds onto a screen. Readers are then asked to choose which of two letters had been in the flashed string. For example, if "WOSK" had been flashed, a reader might have to decide whether "K" or "H" had been in "WOSK". A WSE arises when subjects choose the correct letter more consistently when letter strings are real words rather than nonwords (e.g. "WKRG") or single letters.

==Hypotheses==
The existence of a WSE generally implies that there is some type of access or encoding advantage that words have in the mind that pseudowords or single letters do not have. Various studies have proposed that the distinction is a result of pronounceability differences (nonwords are not pronounceable and therefore are not as easily remembered), frequency (real words are more frequently encountered and used), meaningfulness (real words have [[semantic]] value and therefore are better retained in memory), orthographic regularity (real words follow familiar spelling conventions and are therefore better retained in memory), or neighborhood density (real words tend to share more letters with other words than nonwords and therefore have more activation in the mind).

Other studies have proposed that the WSE is heavily affected or even induced by experimental factors, such as the type of masking used after the presentation of the word,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Johnston | first = J. C.  |author2=J. L. McClelland  | title = Visual factors in word perception  | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics  | volume = 14  | pages = 365–370  | year = 1973  | url = http://psychology.stanford.edu/~jlm/papers/PublicationFiles/73-79_Add_To_ONLINE_Pubs/JohnstonMcClelland73VisualFactors.pdf  | accessdate = 2008-06-30 | doi=10.3758/bf03212406}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the duration of the masks.

==Models==
The two popular models claiming to explain the WSE are the [[Interactive activation and competition networks|interactive activation model]] (IAM)&lt;ref name="McCelland"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCelland | first1 = J. | last2 = Rumelhart | first2 = D. | year = 1981 | title = An interactive activation model of context effects in letter perception: part 1. An account of basic findings | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 88 | issue = 5| pages = 375–407 | doi=10.1037/0033-295X.88.5.375}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[reading for special needs#Approaches and Models of Reading|dual-route coding model]] (DRC)&lt;ref name="Ziegler"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ziegler | first1 = J. | last2 = Rastle | first2 = K. | last3 = Perry | first3 = C. | last4 = Langdon | first4 = R. | last5 = Coltheart | first5 = M. | year = 2001 | title = DRC: A dual route cascaded model of visual word recognition and reading aloud | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 108 | issue = 1| pages = 204–56 | doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.1.204 | pmid=11212628}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither of these models takes attention into account; This is a relationship looked into through research on the WSE. Evidence shows that the WSE persists without an observer’s conscious awareness of the word presented, which implies that attention is neither necessary for WSE nor involved in this phenomenon. However, attentional focus has been demonstrated to modulate the WSE which agrees with recent neurophysiological data explaining that attention, in fact, modulates early stages of word processing.&lt;ref name="Falikman"/&gt;

The activation-verification model (AVM) is another model that was developed to account for reaction time data from [[Lexical decision task|lexical decision]] and naming tasks. The basic operations explored in the AVM that are involved in word and letter recognition are encoding, verification, and decision.&lt;ref name="Paap"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paap | first1 = K. R. | last2 = Newsome | first2 = S. L. | last3 = McDonald | first3 = J. E. | last4 = Schvaneveldt | first4 = R. W. | year = 1982 | title = An activation-verification model for letter and word recognition: the word superiority effect | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 89 | issue = 5| pages = 573–594 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295x.89.5.573 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the IAM and the AVM share many basic assumptions such as the fact that stimulus input activates spatially-specific letter units, that activated letter units, modulate the activity of word units, and that letter and word recognition are frequently affected by top-down processes (e.g. Reading the phrase "A cow says..." a person would guess "moo" and in checking that the word begins with 'm' ignores the rest of the letters).&lt;ref name="Paap" /&gt;

===The WSE and an interactive-activation model===
[[Image:Word superiority effect.svg|right|300px|thumb|Rumelhart &amp; McClelland's interactive-activation model.]]
The WSE has proven to be an important finding for word recognition models, and specifically is supported by [[David Rumelhart|Rumelhart]] and McClelland's interactive-activation model of word recognition. &lt;!-- Can we reference this? --&gt; According to this model, when a reader is presented with a word, each letter in parallel will either stimulate or inhibit different feature detectors (e.g. a curved shape for "C", horizontal and vertical bars for "H", etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chase|first=Christopher H.|last2=Tallal|first2=Paula|title=A developmental, interactive activation model of the word superiority effect|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-0965(90)90069-K|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|volume=49|issue=3|pages=448–487|doi=10.1016/0022-0965(90)90069-k}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those feature detectors will then stimulate or inhibit different letter detectors, which will finally stimulate or inhibit different word detectors. Each activated connection would carry a different weight, and thus the word "WORK" in the example would be activated more than any other word (and therefore recognized by a reader).

According to this interactive-activation model, the WSE is explained as such: When the target letter is presented within a word, the feature detectors, letter detectors and word detectors will all be activated, adding weight to the final recognition of the stimulus.  However, when only the letter is presented, only the letter detector level will be activated. Therefore, we may remember the presented stimulus word more clearly, and thereby be more accurate in identifying its component letters, as observed in the WSE.

===Activation-verification model===
The AVM&lt;ref name=Paap/&gt; deals with encoding, verification, and decision operations. Encoding is used to describe the early operations that lead to the unconscious activation of learned units in memory. After encoding, verification occurs. Verification often leads to the conscious recognition of a single lexical entry from the respondents. Verification is to be viewed as an independent, top-down analysis of stimulus that is guided by the stored, or previously learned, representation of a word. Real-time processing in verification can be mimicked by a computer simulation. Lastly, the factors affecting speed and accuracy of performance in a particular paradigm depend on whether decisions are based primarily on information from encoding or verification.

==Adverse word superiority effect==
One of the findings of the Johnston and McClelland report&lt;!-- Can we reference this? --&gt;was that the WSE does not occur inevitably whenever we compare a word and a nonword. Rather, it depends somewhat upon the strategies that readers use during a task. If readers paid more attention to the letter in a particular ''position'', they would experience the adverse word superiority effect&lt;!-- This needs a basic definition.--&gt;. This is because the reader would no longer have the benefit of having the word detector level activated with as much weight if they neglected to focus on the full word.

The Éditions Mélanie Seteun are a publishing association dedicated to "taking [[popular music]] seriously&lt;ref&gt;Simon Frith, ''Taking Popular Music Seriously'', Ashgate, 2007, 343 pp. Cf. also [http://www.tagg.org/articles/Sforzando05.html this interview] with Philip Tagg.&lt;/ref&gt;, especially within the French-speaking world. They publish ''[[Volume!|Volume! the French Journal of Popular Music Studies]]'', book collections ("Musique et Société", "Musique et environnement professionnel"), and participate in several activities promoting their field of study in France.

==Publications==
=== Book collections===
The Éditions Mélanie Seteun started their activities by creating the "Music et Société" collection of books dealing with popular music, as well as one others (politics with the "Rock &amp; Politics" collection, and more recently, popular music and institutions with the "Musique et Environnement professionnel" collection).

===''Volume ! the French Journal of Popular Music Studies''===
{{Main article|Volume!}}
The founders, Gérôme Guibert and Samuel Étienne, founded ''Volume!'' in 2002 with Marie-Pierre Bonniol, to create an academic space for popular music studies. The journal has published, as of 2017, 29 issues, on themes such as countercultures, black music, postcolonialism, the alternative music press.
Volume! has been online since 2013, on French-speaking portals [[Centre pour l'Édition Électronique Ouverte|Revues.org]] and [[Cairn.info]], as well as on [[Répertoire International de Littérature Musicale|RILM Abstracts with Full Text]]&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.rilm.org/resources/list.php?product=rft&amp;type=music the portal's list]&lt;/ref&gt; since 2016.

=== ''Vibrations. Musiques, médias, société'' ===
The Éditions Mélanie Seteun have directed the electronic publication of the first French popular music studies journal ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Vibrations. Musiques, médias, société|fr}}'', created by Antoine Hennion, Jean-Rémy Julien and Jean-Claude Klein in the mid-1980s, on the French academic portal [[Persée (web portal)|Persée]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/collection/vibra Vibrations], on Persée.&lt;/ref&gt;
