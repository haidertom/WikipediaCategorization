      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15385">'''Action painting''', sometimes called "'''gestural abstraction'''", is a style of [[painting]] in which paint is spontaneously dribbled, splashed or smeared onto the canvas, rather than being carefully applied.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting work often emphasizes the physical act of painting itself as an essential aspect of the finished work or concern of its artist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Background ==
The style was widespread from the 1940s until the early 1960s, and is closely associated with [[abstract expressionism]] (some critics have used the terms "action painting" and "[[abstract expressionism]]" interchangeably).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/art-history-definition-action-painting-183188|title=Art History Definition: Action Painting|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison is often drawn between the American action painting and the French [[tachisme]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[New York School (art)|The New York School]] of American Abstract Expressionism (1940s-50s) is also seen as closely linked to the movement.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/action-painting.htm|title=Action Painting Technique: Definition, Characteristics|website=www.visual-arts-cork.com|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined by the American critic [[Harold Rosenberg]] in 1952,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=9798

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his essay "The American Action Painters",&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Marilyn, 2008,  ''Art History'', 3:d edition, London, Pearson Education, p. 1133.&lt;/ref&gt;  
and signaled a major shift in the aesthetic perspective of [[New York School (art)|New York School]] painters and critics. According to Rosenberg the canvas was "an arena in which to act".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artsy.net/gene/action-painting|title=Action Painting {{!}} Artsy|website=www.artsy.net|language=en|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The actions and means for creating the painting were seen, in action painting, of a higher importance than the end result.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While Rosenberg created the term "action painting" in 1952, he began creating his action theory in the 1930s as a critic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slifkin|first=Robert|date=June 2011|title=The Tragic Image: Action Painting Refigured|url=https://cod.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=vth&amp;AN=64112998&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|journal=Oxford Art Journal|volume=34|pages=227–246|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; While abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Franz Kline]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] had long been outspoken in their view of a painting as an arena within which to come to terms with the act of creation, earlier critics sympathetic to their cause, like [[Clement Greenberg]], focused on their works' "objectness." Clement Greenberg was also an influential critic in action painting, intrigued by the creative struggle, which he claimed was evidenced by the surface of the painting.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  To Greenberg, it was the physicality of the paintings' clotted and oil-caked surfaces that was the key to understanding them. "Some of the labels that became attached to Abstract Expressionism, like "informel" and "Action Painting," definitely implied this; one was given to understand that what was involved was an utterly new kind of art that was no longer art in any accepted sense. This was, of course, absurd." &amp;ndash; Clement Greenberg, "Post Painterly Abstraction".

Rosenberg's critique shifted the emphasis from the object to the struggle itself, with the finished painting being only the physical manifestation, a kind of residue, of the actual work of art, which was in the act or process of the painting's creation. The newer research tends to put the exile-surrealist [[Wolfgang Paalen]] in the position of the artist and theoretician who used the term "action" at first in this sense and fostered the theory of the subjective struggle with it. In his theory of the viewer-dependent possibility space, in which the artist "acts" like in an ecstatic ritual, Paalen considers ideas of [[quantum mechanics]], as well as idiosyncratic interpretations of the totemic vision and the spatial structure of native-Indian painting from British Columbia. His long essay ''Totem Art'' (1943) had considerable influence on such artists as [[Martha Graham]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Mark Rothko]]; Paalen describes a highly artistic vision of totemic art as part of a ritual "action" with psychic links to genetic memory and matrilinear ancestor-worship.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Neufert, ''Auf Liebe und Tod, Das Leben des Surrealisten Wolfgang Paalen'', Berlin (Parthas) 2015, S. 494ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next two decades, Rosenberg's redefinition of art as an act rather than an object, as a process rather than a product, was influential, and laid the foundation for a number of major art movements, from [[Happening]]s and [[Fluxus]] to [[Conceptual Art|Conceptual]], [[Performance art]], [[Installation art]] and [[Earth Art]].

== Historical context ==
It is essential for the understanding of action painting to place it in historical context.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The action painting movement took place in the time after World War II ended. With this came a disordered economy and culture in Europe, and in America the government took advantage of their new state of importance.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=Jason Edwards|date=Spring 2008|title=What the Mind's Eye Sees: Action painters were postwar exemplars of American individualism|url=https://cod.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=vth&amp;AN=31308622&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|journal=American Scholar|volume=77|pages=113–117|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; A product of the [[post-World War II]] artistic resurgence of [[expressionism]] in [[United States|America]] and more specifically [[New York City]], action painting developed in an era where [[quantum mechanics]] and [[psychoanalysis]] were beginning to flourish and were changing people's perception of the physical and psychological world; and civilization's understanding of the world through heightened [[self-consciousness]] and awareness.

American action painters pondered the nature of art as well as the reasons for the existence of art often when questioning what the value of action painting is.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The preceding art of [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] had freed itself from the portrayal of objects and instead tried to evoke, address and delineate, through the aesthetic sense, emotions and feelings within the viewer. ''Action painting'' took this a step further, using both [[Jung]] and [[Freud]]’s ideas of the [[subconscious]] as its underlying foundations. Many of the painters were interested in Carl Jung's studies of archetypal images and types, and used their own internal visions to create their paintings.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Along with Jung, Sigmund Freud and Surrealism were also influential to the beginning of action painting.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The paintings of the Action painters were not meant to portray objects per se or even specific emotions. Instead they were meant to touch the observer deep in the subconscious mind, evoking a sense of the [[wikt:primeval|primeval]] and tapping the collective sense of an [[archetype|archetypal]] visual language. This was done by the artist painting "unconsciously," and spontaneously, creating a powerful arena of raw emotion and action, in the moment. Action painting was clearly influenced by the [[surrealist]] emphasis on [[Surrealist automatism|automatism]] which (also) influenced by psychoanalysis claimed a more direct access to the [[subconscious|subconscious mind]]. Important exponents of this concept of art making were the painters [[Joan Miró]] and [[André Masson]]. However the action painters took everything the surrealists had done a step further.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3903">In [[physiology]], '''aldosterone escape''' is a term that has been used to refer to two distinct phenomena involving [[aldosterone]] that are exactly opposite each other: 
#Escape from the [[sodium]]-retaining effects of excess aldosterone (or other [[mineralocorticoid]]s) in [[primary hyperaldosteronism]], manifested by volume and/or pressure [[natriuresis]].&lt;ref name=prakash&gt;{{cite journal |author=Prakash ES |title="Aldosterone escape" or refractory hyperaldosteronism? |journal=MedGenMed |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=25 |year=2005 |pmid=16369251 |pmc=1681639 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The inability of [[ACE inhibitor]] therapy to reliably suppress aldosterone release, for example, in patients with [[heart failure]] or [[diabetes]], usually manifested by increased salt and water retention. This latter sense may rather be termed [[refractory hyperaldosteronism]].&lt;ref name=prakash/&gt;

In patients with hyperaldosteronism, chronic exposure to excess aldosterone does not cause edema as might be expected.  Aldosterone initially results in an increase in Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reabsorption in these patients through stimulation of [[ENaC]] channels in principal cells of the renal collecting tubules. Increased ENaC channels situated in the apical membranes of the principal cells allow for more Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reabsorption, which may cause a transient increase in fluid reabsorption as well. However, within a few days, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reabsorption returns to normal as evidenced by normal urinary Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels in these patients.

The proposed mechanism for this phenomenon does not include a reduced sensitivity of mineralocorticoid receptors to aldosterone, because low serum potassium is often seen in these patients, which is the direct result of aldosterone-induced expression of ENaC channels. Furthermore, electrolyte homeostasis is maintained in these patients, which excludes the possibility that other Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transporters elsewhere in the kidney are being shut down. If, in fact, other transporters such as the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiporter in the proximal tubule or the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/2Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; symporter in the thick ascending loop of Henle were being blocked, other electrolyte disturbances would be expected, such as seen during use of diuretics.

Instead, experiments isolating the perfusion pressures seen by glomerular capillaries from heightened systemic pressures due to hyperaldosteronism have shown that Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; excretion remains minimal until the kidney is exposed to heightened perfusion pressures. These experiments brought about the proposition that initially high perfusion pressures due to increased Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and water reabsorption in a hyperaldosterone state actually causes "backflow" of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and water into the tubules.

Normally Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and water are reabsorbed from the tubules and dumped into the interstitium. From there, Starling forces dictate the gradient for movement of water and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; into the peritubular capillaries. Because hydrostatic pressures in the tubules, interstitium and peritubular capillaries are normally equivalent, oncotic pressures govern flow.

Typically, oncotic pressures are higher in the peritubular capillaries, because protein composition in the interstitium is nominal; therefore, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and water leave the interstitial space and enter the capillaries. When hydrostatic pressures are raised in the peritubular capillaries such as seen in hyperaldosteronism, Starling forces begin to favor "backflow" of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and water from the interstitium into the tubules—thus, increasing Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; excretion. This is the proposed mechanism of "mineralocorticoid escape" for how patients with increased levels of aldosterone are able to maintain Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; balance and avoid an edematous state.

[[Image:Andreas B.-2.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Andreas Birch as Bishop]]'''Andreas Birch''' (November 6, 1758 – October 25, 1829) was a professor from [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref name = Nielsen&gt;Fr. Nielsens [http://runeberg.org/dbl/2/0282.html Biografi] i 1. ''[[Dansk biografisk leksikon]]'', edited by [[Carl Frederik Bricka|C.F. Bricka]], 2. volume, page 280, [[Gyldendal]], 1887–1905&lt;/ref&gt; Birch was sent in 1781–1783 by the king of Denmark, [[Christian VII]], to examine manuscripts in Italy, Germany, and other European countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger]], [[Bart D. Ehrman]], "The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption and Restoration", ''[[Oxford University Press]]'', 2005, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Birch had a difficult experience at the age of 4 when in one month he lost both of his parents. His uncle, brewer A. T. Gardenholtz, took care of him, however, and by the year 1774, he was a student. Five years later he finished his theological studies in Copenhagen and travelled to [[Göttingen]] to continue his theological and philological studies under the guidance of [[Johann David Michaelis]]' and [[Christian Gottlob Heyne]]. Michaelis, who had big expectations for Birch's scientific abilities, advised him to travel to Italy to study "the hidden and hitherto unused manuscripts of the New Testament."&lt;ref name = Nielsen/&gt; Prime Minister [[Ove Høegh-Guldberg]] successfully helped Birch in acquiring the funds for this venture, and in 1781 Birch left Göttingen, through Switzerland and southern France to Italy. The journey went through Turin, Genoa, and Livorno to Rome and from there on to Naples. In Rome he found an invaluable aid in Monsignor [[Stefano Borgia]], secretary of the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Sacra Congregatio de Propaganda Fide]], who supposedly gave him "considerable evidence to show his friendship." Before he left Rome, Birch was introduced to [[Pope Pius VI]]. His way home went through [[Florence]], [[Bologna]], [[Parma]], [[Venice]], [[Vienna]], [[Prague]], [[Dresden]], and [[Leipzig]] to Göttingen, and from there to Copenhagen. Everywhere he went, his time was spent collecting books, collating old manuscripts of the New Testament and the apocryphal gospels, and busying himself with the study of these.&lt;ref name = Nielsen/&gt;

In the years 1781–1783 he travelled throughout Italy and Germany for the purpose of examining manuscripts. In the Vatican Library he examined 40, in the library of Barberini 10, in other Roman libraries 17, in Florence and other parts of Italy 38, and in Vienna 12 manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;''Bibliotheca Biblica: A Selected List of Books on Sacred Literature'' (Edinburgh 1824), p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

== New edition of the New Testament ==

[[File:Birch, Variae Lectiones ad Textum IV Evangeliorum.JPG|thumb|right|220px|''Variae Lectiones ad Textum IV Evangeliorum'', Haunie 1801]]
After his return in 1783 the king commanded him to Guldberg's option to attend an edition of the New Testament basic text which was printed at royal expense, it was one of Goldberg's last acts as Prime Minister. This version would be a wonderful edition with a rich critical apparatus, which could show the learned world that Denmark would not be outdone when it was a study of the Christian holy book. The large [[Royal Danish Library|Royal Library]] in Copenhagen owned the once considerable variation collections of the New Testament, not only due to general superintendent J. G. C. Adler, who had studied the Syrian Palestinian translation, and then professor in Copenhagen [[Daniel Gotthilf Moldenhawer]] who had examined the New Testament manuscripts in the [[Escorial]] palace and Professor at Kiel C. G. Hensler, who had compared the Copenhagen manuscripts with the usual text. Based on these processors and its own collections completed Birch preparation of the four gospels, which appeared in 1788 as the first part of the planned magnificent edition, in both folio and quarto. As a kind of introduction to this work he had already three years past where a "critical description of Greek Manuscripts of the New Testament."&lt;ref name = Nielsen281&gt;Fr. Nielsens [http://runeberg.org/dbl/2/0282.html Biografi] i 1. ''[[Dansk biografisk leksikon]]'', edited by [[Carl Frederik Bricka|C.F. Bricka]], 2. volume, page 281, [[Gyldendal]], 1887–1905&lt;/ref&gt;

Birch's large version of the four [[Gospel]]s, for which he used [[John Mill (theologian)|John Mill]]'s edition of the New Testament as basis, caused no little stir in the scholarly world,&lt;ref&gt;Michaelis, Neue orient. Bibl. VI, 104 ff. og Eichhorns Bibl. der bibl. Lit. II, 116 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and many thought that the young scholars may be obvious to a university position in his homeland. That same year, as Birch issued the first volume of his magnificent edition, an extraordinary professorship in theology was created, Birch decided to apply but the position eventually went to [[Friedrich Christian Carl Hinrich Münter]] instead. Since both competitors' sample lectures were printed, the critical author [[Niels Ditlev Riegels]], as usual, was discontented with the choice, and in one of his writings ("Tanker ved Gjennemlæsningen af Prøveforelæsningerne for det overordentlige theologiske Professorat", "Thoughts inspired by the reading of the test lectures for the extraordinary professorhip at the Theological Faculty", 1789) he made the insinuation that Münter was appointed to the position beforehand and that the whole competition was just staged to defend that "the University was again being enriched with a German". An unbiased comparison of the two competitors' lectures shows that the lecture of Münter really was not up to his usual standard, but his later authorship soon proved him to be the right choice for the position.&lt;ref name = Nielsen29&gt;Fr. Nielsens [http://runeberg.org/dbl/12/0031.html Biografi] of Münter i 1. ''[[Dansk biografisk leksikon]]'', edited by [[Carl Frederik Bricka|C.F. Bricka]], 12. volume, page 29, [[Gyldendal]], 1887–1905&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1798 Birch published a collection of various readings to the [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] and Epistles (among them from [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]]). Subsequently in 1800 he published a collection of various readings to the Apocalypse, and in 1801 a collection of various readings to the four Gospels.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Prideaux Tregelles|S. P. Tregelles]], ''[https://archive.org/stream/accountofprinted00tre#page/n111/mode/2up The Printed Text of the Greek New Testament]'', London 1854, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wiki-anilingus.png|thumb|Depiction of anilingus]]
'''Anilingus''' (from the Latin ''anus'' + ''-lingus'', from ''lingere'', "to lick", variantly  spelled "'''analingus'''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Contemporary Dictionary of Sexual Euphemisms|author =Jordan Tate|year=2007|publisher=DSt. Martin's Press|isbn=0-312-36298-6|pages=8–9, 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anal Pleasure &amp; Health: A Guide for Men and Women|author =Jack Morin|year=2000|publisher=Down There Press|isbn=0-940208-20-2|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the [[oral sex|oral]] and [[anal sex]] act in which a person stimulates the [[human anus|anus]] of another by using the mouth, including lips, tongue, or teeth. It is also called '''anal–oral contact''' and '''anal–oral sex'''; colloquial names include '''rimming''' and '''rim job'''. It may be performed by and on persons of any [[sexual orientation]] for pleasure or as a form of [[erotic humiliation]]. Health risks include [[fecal–oral route|fecal–oral transmission]].
==Etymology==
The term ''anilingus'' entered English through the 1899 F. J. Rebman translation or Edition 10 of [[sexologist]] [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]]'s 1886 book ''[[Psychopathia sexualis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Forsyth. ''The Etymologicon: A Circular Stroll through the Hidden Connections of the English Language''. Icon Books, 2011, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|anilingus|accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
===General===
Pleasure for the giver during anilingus is usually based more on the principle of the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; The anus has a relatively high concentration of [[Nerve|nerve ending]]s and can be an [[erogenous zone]], and the receiver may receive pleasure from external anal stimulation. The person receiving anilingus is regarded as the passive partner in the act, and the person performing anilingus is the active partner. People may engage in anilingus for its own sake, before anal [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]] or penetration, or as part of [[foreplay]]. Studies indicate that anilingus is a rare [[Lesbian sexual practices|sexual practice between women]].&lt;ref name="Zenilman &amp; Shahmanesh"&gt;{{cite book | title = Sexually Transmitted Infections: Diagnosis, Management, and Treatment| publisher = [[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers]] | year = 2011 | pages = 329–330 | accessdate = 14 May 2014 |isbn = 0495812943| url = https://books.google.com/?id=lO5BND02eBwC&amp;pg=PA329&amp;dq=|quote= |author1=Jonathan Zenilman |author2=Mohsen Shahmanesh }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Diamant AL, Lever J, Schuster M |title=Lesbians' Sexual Activities and Efforts to Reduce Risks for Sexually Transmitted Diseases |journal=J Gay Lesbian Med Assoc. |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=41–8 |date=Jun 2000 |doi=10.1023/A:1009513623365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technique===
Anilingus can involve a variety of techniques to stimulate the anus, including [[kissing]] or licking; it may also involve the tongue moving around the edge of the anus or up and down the insides of the cheeks of the [[buttock]]s, and in and out of the anus.

Anilingus can be performed in a number of [[sex position]]s including:

* the passive partner is on all fours in the [[doggy position]] with the active partner performing anilingus from behind.
* the passive partner is on their back in the [[missionary position]] with their legs raised high with the knees drawn towards their chest, and with some sort of support (such as a pillow) under their hips for comfort and to raise their buttocks. With the partner's anus exposed, the active partner kneels between the partner's legs to perform anilingus.
* the passive partner on top in the [[69 (sex position)|69]] position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaylifeuk.com/gay-sex-guide/rimming.html|title=Rimming - GayLifeUK|author =Adam Cowell|date=|work=gaylifeuk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morin, J. (1998). Anal pleasure and Health. Oakland, CA: Down there press.&lt;/ref&gt; The passive partner may lie down on the active partner in the missionary position, with legs raised high, from the front to raise the partner's buttocks to perform anilingus on the exposed anus.
* often used in combination with the 69 position detailed above, another position has the active partner lying on their back with the passive partner [[Facesitting|sitting on their face]]. This position allows the "passive" partner to become more active or even completely dominant as they can now easily gyrate their hips and thrust their pelvis.
* the ''[[rusty trombone]]'', in which a male stands while the active partner performs both anilingus from behind, generally from a kneeling position, and also performs [[masturbation]] on the standing partner, thus somewhat resembling someone playing the [[trombone]].&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;Tate, Jordan.

==Health risks and prevention==

===Health risk===
{{Main|Fecal–oral route}}
Anilingus has potential health risks arising from the oral contact with [[human feces]]. Diseases which may be transmitted by contact with feces include: bacterial diseases including [[shigellosis]] (bacillary dysentery); viral systemic diseases including [[hepatitis A]], [[hepatitis B]], [[hepatitis C]], [[poliomyelitis]], [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV) and [[herpes simplex virus]]; parasites including [[intestinal parasite]]s; and infections and inflammations [[chlamydia infection]], [[gastroenteritis]], [[conjunctivitis]], [[gonorrhea]], [[lymphogranuloma venereum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lgbt.foundation/get-support/for-men/think-you-have-an-sti-/Lymphogranuloma-Venereum|title=Lymphogranuloma Venereum - LGBT Foundation|author =LGBT Foundation|date=|work=lgbt.foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Applying the mouth to the genitals immediately after applying it to the anus can introduce the [[bacterium]] ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' ("''E. coli''") into the [[urethra]], leading to a [[urinary tract infection]]. [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] is not believed to be easily transmitted through anilingus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anilingus with a number of casual partners increases the health risks associated with the practice. Generally, people carrying infections that may be passed on during anilingus appear healthy. [[Intestinal parasite|Parasites]] may be in the feces if undercooked meat was consumed. The feces contain traces of [[hepatitis A]] only if the infected person has eaten contaminated food.

Another recent study suggests a [[correlation]] between [[oral sex]] and [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]]. It is believed that this is due to the transmission of HPV because this virus has been implicated in most [[cervical cancer]]s. The study concludes that people who had one to five oral-sex partners in their lifetime had approximately a doubled risk of throat cancer compared with those who never engaged in this activity. Those with more than five oral-sex partners had a 250% increased risk compared with those who never engaged in this activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Prevention===
[[Safe sex]] practices may include thorough washing of the anal region before anilingus to wash away most external fecal particles and reduce the risk of contraction of fecal-sourced infection. An [[enema]] can also reduce the risk of direct fecal contact.&lt;ref name="Castleman"&gt;{{cite web |last = Castleman |first = Michael |date=27 April 2010 |title = Rimming: The curious couple's guide to oral-anal play  |publisher = ''Psychology Today'' |accessdate=23 November 2012 |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-sex/201004/rimming-the-curious-couples-guide-oral-anal-play}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[dental dam]] may also be used, and another safe sex practice is to avoid unprotected sex which involves [[fellatio]] after anal intercourse.

If the receiving partner has wounds or open sores on the genitals, or if the giving partner has wounds or open sores on or in the mouth, or bleeding gums, this poses an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections. Brushing the teeth, flossing, undergoing dental work, and eating crunchy foods (such as potato chips) relatively soon before or after performing anilingus also increases the risk of transmission, because all of these activities can cause small scratches on the inside of the lips, cheeks, and palate. These wounds, even when they are [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]], increase the chances of contracting sexually transmitted infections that can be transmitted orally under these conditions.

==As punishment==
Forced and mostly public anilingus was used as a form of humiliation and punishment, usually of prisoners. The use of the practice in the [[Thirty Years' War]] was described by [[Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen|Grimmelshausen]] in ''[[Simplicius Simplicissimus]]'' (1668).&lt;ref&gt;''Simplicissimus, The German Adventurer'', trans. John C. Osborne, Newfound Press, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-9797292-5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is commonly referred to as "arse licking", and the term is still at times applied to the behaviour of someone who is overly respectful or helpful to someone in authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/arse-licking|title=arse-licking definition and synonyms - Macmillan Dictionary|date=|work=macmillandictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Incarceration in the United States|United States prison system]], anilingus is one of the ways one prisoner pays his dues to another inmate. In [[prison slang]], this activity is known as "tossing a salad".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Byrne | first1 = J. | last2 = Hummer | first2 = D. | doi = 10.1016/j.avb.2007.02.001 | title = In search of the "Tossed Salad Man" (and others involved in prison violence): New strategies for predicting and controlling violence in prison | journal = Aggression and Violent Behavior | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 531 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marc Levin]] for HBO (1996).

The '''Astrophysics Research Institute''' ('''ARI''') is an [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]] research institute located in [[Merseyside]], UK. Formed in 1992, the institute was situated on the [[Twelve Quays]] site in [[Birkenhead]] from 1998 to 2013, until in June 2013 the institute relocated to the Liverpool Science Park in [[Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukspa.org.uk/news/member_news/content/3853/astrophysics_research_institute_joins_liverpool_science_park |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130707081939/http://www.ukspa.org.uk/news/member_news/content/3853/astrophysics_research_institute_joins_liverpool_science_park |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 July 2013 |title=Astrophysics Research Institute Joins Liverpool Science Park |accessdate=4 June 2013 |publisher=United Kingdom Science Park Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/NewsUpdate/viewarticle/803/All |title= Astrophysics is moving |accessdate= 7 June 2013 |date= 31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute is in the top 1% of institutions in the field of [[space science]] as measured by total [[citation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.in-cites.com/institutions/LivplJhnMoresU-AstrphyResIns.html |title= An interview with: Liverpool John Moores University, Astrophysics Research Institute |date= March 2007 |accessdate= 7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently over 90 staff members and research students working at the institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/people |title= Staff at the Astrophysics Research Institute |accessdate= 27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which lies within the administration of the [[Liverpool John Moores University]]'s Faculty of Engineering and Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/faculties/faculty-of-engineering-and-technology |title= LJMU Faculty of Engineering and Technology |accessdate= 27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Conducted research varies into many areas of astronomy and astrophysics, such as [[supernova]]e, [[star formation]] and [[galaxy clusters]]. Research is funded by external organisations, such as the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stfc.ac.uk/gow/Sm/grls.asp?cx=01&amp;sc=0&amp;so=oa&amp;in=166&amp;nv=0102&amp;dp=15843 |title=STFC Grants on the Web: Institution analysis |publisher=Stfc.ac.uk |date=2012-10-15 |accessdate=2012-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319220439/http://www.stfc.ac.uk/GOW/Sm/grls.asp?cx=01&amp;sc=0&amp;so=oa&amp;in=166&amp;nv=0102&amp;dp=15843 |archivedate=19 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/aboutari |title=Astrophysics Research Institute - Liverpool John Moores University |publisher=Astro.ljmu.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute maintains the [[Liverpool Telescope]] which is located on the island of [[La Palma]] in the [[Canary Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://telescope.livjm.ac.uk/ | title = Liverpool Telescope | accessdate = 2012-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
The institute currently teaches two undergraduate courses: a 3-year [[Bachelor of Science|BSc (Hons)]] in Physics and Astronomy, as well as a 4-year [[Master of Physics|MPhys (Hons)]] in Astrophysics. Both the undergraduate courses are taught as a [[Double degree|joint degree]] by the Astrophysics Research Institute of [[Liverpool John Moores University]] and the Department of Physics at the [[University of Liverpool]]. The courses are accredited by the [[Institute of Physics]].

Postgraduate courses are made available at [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] and [[Master of Science|Master's]] level, with two MSc courses taught via [[distance learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.astronomy.ac.uk/msc | title = Astrophysics MSc | accessdate = 2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unaccredited short courses are also made available to those who do not have a scientific or mathematical background. The Astronomy by Distance Learning courses are taught by CD-ROM, DVD and website material without the need for classroom sessions. Each of the courses provides an introduction into astronomy as well as specialist areas such as [[supernova]]e.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.astronomy.ac.uk/info/index | title = Courses | accessdate = 2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2006, the institute received the "''[[Queen's Anniversary Prize]]''" for higher education in recognition for its development of the robotic telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/4717744.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; Merseyside &amp;#124; Royal recognition for university |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2006-02-15 |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the "''[[Times Higher Education|Times Higher Education Supplement Award]]''" for 'project of the year' was given for the use of RINGO [[Polarimeter|optical polarimeter]] at the [[Liverpool Telescope]] in measuring [[gamma-ray bursts]].

{{Other uses|The Big Bounce (disambiguation)}}
{{cosmology}}
The '''Big Bounce''' is a hypothetical [[cosmological model]] for the origin of the known [[universe]]. It was originally suggested as a phase of the ''[[cyclic model]]'' or ''oscillatory universe'' interpretation of the [[Big Bang]], where the first cosmological event was the result of the collapse of a previous universe. It receded from serious consideration in the early 1980s after [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflation theory]] emerged as a solution to the [[horizon problem]], which had arisen from advances in observations revealing the [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|large-scale structure]] of the universe. In the early 2000s, inflation was found by some theorists to be problematic and [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] in that its various parameters could be adjusted to fit any observations, so that the properties of the observable universe are a matter of chance. Alternative pictures including a Big Bounce may provide a [[Prediction#Prediction in science|predictive]] and falsifiable possible solution to the horizon problem, and are under active investigation as of 2017.&lt;ref name="BrandenbergerPeter2017"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Brandenberger|first1=Robert |last2=Peter|first2=Patrick |title=Bouncing Cosmologies: Progress and Problems |journal=Foundations of Physics |year=2017 |issn=0015-9018 |doi=10.1007/s10701-016-0057-0 |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.05834.pdf|arxiv = 1603.05834 |bibcode = 2017FoPh...47..797B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expansion and contraction ==
The concept of the Big Bounce envisions the Big Bang as the beginning of a [[metric expansion of space|period of expansion]] that followed a period of contraction. In this view, one could talk of a ''[[Big Crunch]]'' followed by a ''Big Bang'', or more simply, a ''Big Bounce''. This suggests that we could be living at any point in an infinite sequence of universes, or conversely the current universe could be the very first iteration. However, if the condition of the interval phase "between bounces", considered the 'hypothesis of the primeval atom', is taken into full contingency such enumeration may be meaningless because that condition could represent a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] in time at each instance, if such perpetual return was absolute and undifferentiated.

The main idea behind the quantum theory of a Big Bounce is that, as density approaches infinity, the behavior of the ''[[quantum foam]]'' changes. All the so-called [[dimensionless physical constant|fundamental physical constant]]s, including the speed of light in a vacuum, need not remain constant during a [[Big Crunch]], especially in the time interval smaller than that in which measurement may never be possible (one unit of [[Planck time]], roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds) spanning or bracketing the point of inflection.

If the fundamental physical constants were determined in a quantum-mechanical manner during the Big Crunch, then their apparently inexplicable values in this universe would not be so surprising, it being understood here that a ''universe'' is that which exists between a [[Big Bang]] and its [[Big Crunch]].

The Big Bounce Models, however do not explain much about that how the currently expanding universe will manage to contract. This constant and steady expansion is explained by [https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-powered-the-big-bang/ NASA] through the [[metric expansion of space]].

== History ==
Big bounce models have a venerable history{{elucidate|date=December 2016}} and were endorsed on largely aesthetic grounds{{which|date=December 2016}}{{when|date=December 2016}} by cosmologists including [[Willem de Sitter]], [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]], [[George McVittie]] and [[George Gamow]] (who stressed that "from the physical point of view we must forget entirely about the precollapse period").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kragh|first=Helge|title=Cosmology|year=1996|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ, USA|isbn=0-691-00546-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1980s, the advancing precision and scope of [[observational cosmology]] had revealed that the [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|large-scale structure]] of the universe is [[shape of the universe|flat]], [[wiktionary:homogeneous|homogenous]] and [[isotropic]], a finding later accepted as the [[Cosmological Principle]] to apply at scales beyond roughly 300 million [[light-year]]s. It was recognized that it was necessary to [[horizon problem|find an explanation]] for how distant regions of the universe could have essentially identical properties without ever having been in light-like communication. A solution was proposed to be a period of exponential expansion of space in the early universe, as a basis for what became known as [[Inflation (cosmology)|Inflation theory]]. Following the brief inflationary period, the universe continues to expand, but at a less rapid rate.

Various formulations of inflation theory and their detailed implications became the subject of intense theoretical study. In the absence of a compelling alternative, inflation became the leading solution to the horizon problem. In the early 2000s, inflation was found by some theorists to be problematic and unfalsifiable in that its various parameters could be adjusted to fit any observations, a situation known as a fine-tuning problem.  Furthermore, inflation was found to be inevitably [[Eternal inflation|eternal]], creating an infinity of different universes with typically different properties, so that the properties of the observable universe are a matter of chance.&lt;ref name="Nautilus2014"&gt;{{cite news |last1=McKee|first1=Maggie |title=Ingenious: Paul J.

The phrase "Big Bounce" appeared in the scientific literature in 1987, when it was first used in the title of a pair of articles (in German) in ''Stern und Weltraum'' by Wolfgang Priester and Hans-Joachim Blome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Overduin|first=James |author2=Hans-Joachim Blome |author3=Josef Hoell|title=Wolfgang Priester: from the big bounce to the Λ-dominated universe|journal=Naturwissenschaften|date=June 2007|volume=94|issue=6|pages=417–429|arxiv = astro-ph/0608644 |bibcode = 2007NW.....94..417O |doi = 10.1007/s00114-006-0187-x |pmid=17146687}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reappeared in 1988 in Iosif Rozental's ''Big Bang, Big Bounce'', a revised English-language translation of a Russian-language book (by a different title), and in a 1991 article (in English) by Priester and Blome in ''Astronomy and Astrophysics''. (The phrase apparently originated as the title of [[The Big Bounce (novel)|a novel]] by [[Elmore Leonard]] in 1969, shortly after increased public awareness of the [[Big Bang]] model with of the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background]] by [[Arno Penzias|Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] in 1965.)

[[Martin Bojowald]], an assistant professor of physics at [[Pennsylvania State University]], published a study in July 2007 detailing work somewhat related to [[loop quantum gravity]] that claimed to mathematically solve the time before the Big Bang, which would give new weight to the oscillatory universe and Big Bounce theories.&lt;ref name="Bojowald2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bojowald |first=Martin |authorlink= |year=2007 |title=What happened before the Big Bang? |journal=Nature Physics |volume=3 |issue=8 |pages=523&amp;ndash;525 |doi=10.1038/nphys654 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode = 2007NatPh...3..523B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main problems with the Big Bang theory is that at the moment of the Big Bang, there is a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] of zero volume and infinite energy. This is normally interpreted as the end of the physics as we know it; in this case, of the theory of [[general relativity]]. This is why one expects quantum effects to become important and avoid the singularity.

However, research in [[loop quantum cosmology]] purported to show that a previously existing [[universe]] collapsed, not to the point of singularity, but to a point before that where the quantum effects of [[gravity]] become so strongly repulsive that the universe rebounds back out, forming a new branch. Throughout this collapse and bounce, the evolution is unitary.

Bojowald also claims that some properties of the universe that collapsed to form ours can also be determined. Some properties of the prior universe are not determinable however due to some kind of uncertainty principle.

This work is still in its early stages and very speculative. Some extensions by further scientists have been published in ''Physical Review'' Letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ashtekar |first=Abhay |authorlink= |author2=Corichi, Alejandro |author3=Singh, Parampreet  |year=2008 |title=Robustness of key features of loop quantum cosmology |journal=Physical Review D |volume=77 |issue= 2|pages=024046 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.77.024046 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode = 2008PhRvD..77b4046A |arxiv = 0710.3565 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Peter Lynds]] has put forward a new cosmology model in which time is cyclic. In his theory our Universe will eventually stop expanding and then contract. Before becoming a singularity, as one would expect from Hawking's black hole theory, the universe would bounce. Lynds claims that a singularity would violate the [[second law of thermodynamics]] and this stops the universe from being bounded by singularities. The Big Crunch would be avoided with a new Big Bang. Lynds suggests the exact history of the universe would be repeated in each cycle in an [[eternal recurrence]]. Some critics argue that while the universe may be cyclic, the histories would all be variants.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}&lt;!--Please, read Wikipedia's policy about self-published sources before citing Peter Lynds' work--&gt; Lynds' theory has been dismissed by mainstream physicists for the lack of a mathematical model behind its philosophical considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Strange story of Peter Lynds |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/research/story/0,9865,1017994,00.html|author=David Adam | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=14 August 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, it was proposed that the application of [[loop quantum gravity]] techniques to [[Big Bang cosmology]] can lead to a bounce that need not be cyclic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Penn State Researchers Look Beyond The Birth Of The Universe |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/05/060515232747.htm |work=[[Science Daily]] |publisher= |date=May 17, 2006 |accessdate= }} Referring to {{cite journal |last=Ashtekar |first=Abhay |authorlink= |author2=Pawlowski, Tomasz |author3=Singh, Parmpreet  |year=2006 |title=Quantum Nature of the Big Bang |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=96 |issue= 14|page=141301|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.141301 |pmid=16712061 |bibcode=2006PhRvL..96n1301A|arxiv = gr-qc/0602086 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Nikodem Popławski]] showed that a nonsingular Big Bounce appears naturally in the [[Einstein–Cartan theory|Einstein-Cartan]]-Sciama-Kibble theory of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poplawski, N. J. |authorlink=Nikodem Popławski |year=2012 |title=Nonsingular, big-bounce cosmology from spinor-torsion coupling |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=85 |pages=107502 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.85.107502|arxiv = 1111.4595 |bibcode = 2012PhRvD..85j7502P }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This theory extends general relativity by removing a constraint of the symmetry of the affine connection and regarding its antisymmetric part, the [[torsion tensor]], as a dynamical variable. The minimal coupling between torsion and Dirac spinors generates a spin-spin interaction which is significant in fermionic matter at extremely high densities. Such an interaction averts the unphysical Big Bang singularity, replacing it with a cusp-like bounce at a finite minimum scale factor, before which the universe was contracting. This scenario also explains why the present Universe at largest scales appears spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic, providing a physical alternative to cosmic inflation.

In 2012, a new theory of nonsingular big bounce was successfully constructed within the frame of standard Einstein gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cai |first= Yi-Fu |authorlink= |author2=Damien Easson |author3=[[Robert Brandenberger]] |year=2012 |title=Towards a Nonsingular Bouncing Cosmology |journal=[[Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics]] |volume=08 |pages=020 |doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2012/08/020|arxiv = 1206.2382 |bibcode = 2012JCAP...08..020C }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This theory combines the benefits of matter bounce and [[Ekpyrotic cosmology]]. Particularly, the famous BKL instability, that the homogeneous and isotropic background cosmological solution is unstable to the growth of anisotropic stress, is resolved in this theory. Moreover, curvature perturbations seeded in matter contraction are able to form a nearly scale-invariant primordial power spectrum and thus provides a consistent mechanism to explain the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) observations.

A few sources argue that distant [[supermassive black holes]] whose large size is hard to explain so soon after the Big Bang, such as [[ULAS J1342+0928]],&lt;ref name="NASA-20171206"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Landau |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Bañados |first2=Eduardo |title=Found: Most Distant Black Hole |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7017 |date=6 December 2017 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=6 December 2017 | quote="This black hole grew far larger than we expected in only 690 million years after the Big Bang, which challenges our theories about how black holes form," said study co-author Daniel Stern of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be evidence for a Big Bounce, with these supermassive black holes being formed before the Big Bounce.&lt;ref name=News_com-AU_2017-12-07a&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/science/space/black-hole-at-the-dawn-of-time-challenges-our-understanding-of-how-the-universe-was-formed/news-story/3279356705a47d45416ae2e6ead41175|title=Black hole at the dawn of time challenges our understanding of how the universe was formed|author=Jamie Seidel|date=7 December 2017|accessdate=9 December 2017|publisher=News Corp Australia |quote=It had reached its size just 690 million years after the point beyond which there is nothing. The most dominant scientific theory of recent years describes that point as the Big Bang — a spontaneous eruption of reality as we know it out of a quantum singularity.

And the existence of early black holes has been predicted to be a key telltale as to whether or not the idea may be valid. This one is very big. To get to its size — 800 million times more mass than our Sun — it must have swallowed a lot of stuff. ...

Potential sequestration alternatives to carbon farming include scrubbing the air with machines; [[Ocean fertilization|fertilizing the oceans]] to prompt [[Algal bloom|algal blooms]] that after death carry carbon to the sea bottom; storing the carbon dioxide emitted by electricity generation; and crushing and spreading types of rock such as basalt that absorb atmospheric carbon.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Land management techniques other than farming include planting/restoring forests, burying [[biochar]] produced by [[Pyrolysis|anaerobically]] converted biomass and restoring wetlands. (Coal beds are the remains of [[Marsh|marshes]] and [[Mire|peatlands]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehmann|first=Johannes|last2=Gaunt|first2=John|last3=Rondon|first3=Marco|date=2006-03-01|title=Bio-char Sequestration in Terrestrial Ecosystems – A Review|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11027-005-9006-5|journal=Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change|language=en|volume=11|issue=2|pages=403–427|doi=10.1007/s11027-005-9006-5|issn=1381-2386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 2011 Australia started a [[Emissions trading|cap-and-trade]] program. Farmers who [[Carbon sequestration|sequester carbon]] can sell [[Carbon credit|carbon credits]] to companies in need of [[Carbon offset|carbon offsets]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The country's Direct Action Plan states "The single largest opportunity for {{Chem|CO|2}} emissions reduction in Australia is through bio-sequestration in general, and in particular, the replenishment of our soil carbons." In studies of test plots over 20 years showed increased microbial activity when farmers incorporated organic matter or reduced tillage. However, soil carbon levels from 1990-2006 declined by 30% on average under continuous cropping. Incorporating organic matter alone was not enough to build carbon. [[Nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]] and [[Sulfur|sulphur]] had to be added as well to build soil carbon.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/29/carbon-farming-its-a-nice-theory-but-dont-get-your-hopes-up|title=Carbon farming: it's a nice theory, but don't get your hopes up|last=Chan|first=Gabrielle|date=2013-10-29|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 2014 more than 75% of the [[Canadian Prairies|Canadian Prairie]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s' cropland had adopted "conservation tillage" and more than 50% had adopted no till.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Awada|first=L.|last2=Lindwall|first2=C.W.|last3=Sonntag|first3=B.|date=March 2014|title=The development and adoption of conservation tillage systems on the Canadian Prairies|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2095633915300137|journal=International Soil and Water Conservation Research|volume=2|issue=1|pages=47–65|doi=10.1016/s2095-6339(15)30013-7|issn=2095-6339|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Twenty-five countries pledged to adopt the practice at the December 2015 [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Paris climate talks]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
In California multiple [[Conservation district|Resource Conservation Districts]] (RCDs) support local partnerships to develop and implement carbon farming,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2015 the agency that administers California's carbon-credit exchange began granting credits to farmers who compost grazing lands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
In 2016 Chevrolet partnered with the [[United States Department of Agriculture|US Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) to purchase 40,000 carbon credits from ranchers on 11,000 no-till acres. The transaction equates to removing 5,000 cars from the road and was the largest to date in the US.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
In 2017 multiple US states passed legislation in support of carbon farming and soil health.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ecowatch.com/carbon-farming-2457937143.html|title=6 States Tapping Into the Benefits of Carbon Farming|last=|first=|date=2017-07-12|work=EcoWatch|access-date=2018-04-27|publisher=Center For Food Safety|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* California appropriated $7.5 million as part of its Healthy Soils Program. The objective is to demonstrate that "specific management practices sequester carbon, improve soil health and reduce atmospheric greenhouse gases." The program includes mulching, cover crops, composting, hedgerows and buffer strips.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Nearly half of California counties have farmers who are working on carbon-farming.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
* Maryland's Healthy Soils Program supports research, education and technical assistance.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Massachusetts funds education and training to support agriculture that regenerates soil health.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Hawaii created the Carbon Farming Task Force to develop incentives to increase soil carbon content.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A 250-acre demonstration project attempted to produce biofuels from the [[pongamia]] tree. Pongamia adds nitrogen back into the soil. Similarly, one ranch wrangles 2,000 head of cattle on 4,000 acres, using regenerative grazing to build soil, store carbon, restore hydrologic function and reduce runoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.greenbiz.com/article/turning-dirt-climate-goals-carbon-farming|title=Turning dirt into climate goals via carbon farming|last=Swaffer|first=Miriam|date=2017-07-11|work=GreenBiz|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other states are considering similar programs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
=== Four per 1,000 ===
The largest international effort to promote carbon farming is “four per 1,000”, led by France. Its goal is to increase soil carbon by 0.4 percent per year through agricultural and forestry changes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
== Soil carbon ==
Traditionally, soil carbon was thought to accumulate when decaying organic matter was physically mixed with soil. More recently, the role of living plants has been emphasized. Small roots die and decay while the plant is alive, depositing carbon below the surface. Further, as plants grow, their roots inject some carbon into the soil, feeding [[mycorrhiza]]. An estimated 12,000 miles of their [[Hypha|hyphae]] live in every square meter of healthy soil.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
== Techniques ==
At least thirty-two [[Natural Resources Conservation Service|Natural Resource Conservation Service]] (NRCS) practices improve soil health and sequester carbon, along with important co-benefits: increased water retention, hydrological function, [[biodiversity]] and resilience. Approved practices may make farmers eligible for federal funds. Not all carbon farming techniques (e.g., composting) have been recommended.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
Carbon farming may consider related issues such as groundwater and surface water degradation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
=== Tilling ===
Carbon farming minimizes disruption to soils over the planting/growing/harvest cycle. [[Tillage]] is avoided using [[Seed drill|seed drills]] or similar techniques. Livestock can trample and/or eat the remains of a harvested field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
=== Livestock grazing ===
Grazing livestock sequesters carbon when the animal eats the grass, causing its roots to release carbon into the soil. However, these animals also produce significant methane, potentially offsetting the benefits of sequestration. Livestock is regularly rotated through multiple [[Paddock|paddocks]] (as often as daily) allowing the paddocks to rest/recover between grazing periods. This pattern produces stable grasslands with significant fodder.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Annual grasses have shallower roots and die once they’re grazed. Rotational grazing led to the replace of the annuals perennials with deeper roots, which can recover after limited grazing. By contrast, allowing animals to range over a large area for an extended period can destroy the grassland.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
==== Silvopasture ====
[[Silvopasture]] involves grazing livestock under tree cover, with trees separated enough to allow adequate sunlight to reach the ground.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, a farm in Mexico planted native trees on {{Convert|22|ha|acre}} grazing cattle on the paddock. This evolved into a successful organic dairy. The operation became a subsistence farm, earning income from consulting/training others rather than from crop production.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
=== Organic Mulch ===
[[Mulch|Mulching]] covers the soil around plants with a mulch of wood chips or straw. Alternatively, crop residue can be left in place to enter the soil as it decomposes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
=== Compost ===
{{Main|Compost}}
[[Compost]] sequesters carbon in a stable (not easily accessed) form. Carbon farmers dust it over the soil surface without tilling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
A 2013 study found that a single compost application significantly and durably increased grassland carbon storage by 25-70%. The continuation sequestration likely came from increased water-holding and “fertilization” by compost decomposition. Both factors support increased productivity. Both tested sites showed large increases in grassland productivity: a forage increase of 78% in the drier valley site, while the wetter coastal site averaged an increase of 42%. {{Chem|CH|4}} and {{Chem|N|2|O}} and emissions did not increase significantly. Methane fluxes were negligible. Soil {{Chem|N|2|O}} emissions from temperate grasslands amended with chemical fertilizers and manures were orders of magnitude higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=RYALS|first=REBECCA|last2=SILVER|first2=WHENDEE L.|date=|year=2013|title=Effects of Organic Matter Amendments on Net Primary Productivity|url=https://www.marincarbonproject.org/file/2018-documents/Paper-Summary---Effects-of-Organic-Matter-Amendments-on-Net-Primary-Productivity.pdf|dead-url=|journal=Ecological Applications|publisher=Ecological Society of America|volume=23|issue=1|pages=46–59|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another study found that grasslands treated with a single treatment .5" of commercial compost began absorbing carbon at an annual rate of nearly 1.5 tons/acre and continued to do so in subsequent years. As of 2018, this study had not been replicated.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Cover crops ===
With row crops such as corn and wheat, fast-growing ground cover is grown between the stalks (e.g., [[clover]] or [[Vicia|vetch]]). They protect the soil from carbon loss through the winter and may be planted together with cash crops to compensate for carbon lost when those crops are harvested.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Forage crops such as grasses, clovers and alfalfa develop extensive root systems that can become soil organic matter. Crops with poor root systems (corn, soybeans) do not increase organic matter in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/how-carbon-farming-can-help-solve-climate-change-86087|title=How carbon farming can help solve climate change|last=Burton|first=David|date=November 9, 2017|work=The Conversation|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Bamboo ===
[[Bamboo]] stores large amounts of carbon in the soil and in its superstructure.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
=== Hybrids ===
Perennial crops offer the highest potential to sequester carbon, when grown in multilayered systems. These systems can be challenging and require farmers to cultivate potentially unfamiliar crops. One system uses perennial staple crops that grow on trees that are analogs to maize and beans, or vines, palms and herbaceous perennials.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
== Conventional agriculture ==
Plowing splits soil aggregates and allows microorganisms to consume their organic compounds. The increased microbial activity releases nutrients, initially boosting yield. Thereafter the loss of structure reduces soil’s ability to hold water and resist erosion, thereby reducing  yield.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
== Criticisms ==
Critics say that the related [[regenerative agriculture]] cannot be adopted enough to matter or that it could lower commodity prices. The impact of increased soil carbon on yield has yet to be resolved. Another criticism says that no-till practices may increase herbicide use, diminishing or eliminating the benefits.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
Composting is not an NRCS-approved technique and its impacts on native species and the greenhouse emissions during production have not been fully resolved. Further, commercial compost supplies are too limited to cover large amounts of land.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
== Resources ==
USDA offers a tool called COMET-Farm that estimates a farm's [[carbon footprint]]. Farmers can evaluate various land management scenarios to learn which is the best fit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6161">A '''catastrophic failure''' is a sudden and total [[failure]] from which recovery is impossible. Catastrophic failures often lead to [[Cascading failure|cascading systems failure]]. The term is most commonly used for [[structural failures]], but has often been extended to many other disciplines in which total and irrecoverable loss occurs. Such failures are investigated using the methods of [[forensic engineering]], which aims to isolate the cause or causes of failure.

For example, catastrophic failure can be observed in [[steam turbine#Two-flow rotors|steam turbine rotor]] failure, which can occur due to peak stress on the rotor; stress concentration increases up to a point at which it is excessive, leading ultimately to the failure of the disc.

In firearms, catastrophic failure usually refers to a rupture or disintegration of the barrel or receiver of the gun when firing it. Some possible causes of this are an [[out of battery|out-of-battery]] gun, an inadequate [[headspace (firearms)|headspace]], the use of incorrect ammunition, the use of ammunition with an incorrect [[propellant]] charge,&lt;ref name="hendrick"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hal W.

A failure of this type, known colloquially as a "kaboom", or "kB" failure, can pose a threat not only to the user(s) but even many bystanders.

In chemical engineering, [[thermal runaway]] can cause catastrophic failure.

==Examples==

[[Image:Original Tay Bridge before the 1879 collapse.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Original Tay Bridge from the north]]
[[Image:Tay bridge down.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Fallen Tay Bridge from the north]]
Examples of catastrophic failure of engineered structures include:
* The [[Tay Rail Bridge disaster]] of 1879, where the center half mile of the bridge was completely destroyed while a train was crossing in a storm. The bridge was badly designed and its replacement was built as a separate structure upstream of the old.
* The failure of the [[South Fork Dam]] in 1889 released 4.8 billion US gallons (18 billion litres) of water and killed over 2,200 people (popularly known as the [[Johnstown Flood]]).
* The collapse of the [[St. Francis Dam]] in 1928 released 12.4 billion US gallons (47 billion litres) of water, resulting in a death toll of nearly 600 people.
* The collapse of the first [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge]] of 1940, where the main deck of the road bridge was totally destroyed by dynamic oscillations in a {{convert|40|mph|kph}} wind.
* The [[De Havilland Comet#Comet disasters of 1954|De Havilland Comet disasters of 1954]], later determined to be structural failures due to [[Fatigue (material)|metal fatigue]] that had not been anticipated at the corners of square windows used by the Comet 1.
* The 62 [[Banqiao Dam]]s failure event in China in 1975, due to [[Typhoon Nina (1975)|Typhoon Nina]]. Approximately 86,000 people died from flooding and another 145,000 died from subsequent diseases, total of 231,000 deaths.
* The [[Hyatt Regency walkway collapse]] of 1981, where a suspended walkway in a hotel lobby in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], collapsed completely, killing over 100 people on and below the structure.
* The [[STS-51-L|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]] of 1986, in which an O-ring of a rocket booster failed, causing the external fuel tank to break up and making the shuttle veer off course, subjecting it to aerodynamic forces beyond design tolerances; the entire crew and vehicle were lost.
* The [[Nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactor]] at the [[Chernobyl nuclear power plant|Chernobyl power plant]], which [[Chernobyl disaster|exploded in 1986]] causing the release of a substantial amount of [[radioactive]] materials.
* The collapse of the [[Warsaw radio mast]] of 1991, which had up to that point held the title of [[world's tallest structure]].
* The [[Sampoong Department Store collapse]] of 1995, which happened due to structural weaknesses, killed 502 people and injured 937.
* The [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks]] and subsequent fire at the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] on September 11, 2001, weakened the floor [[joist]]s to the point of catastrophic failure.
* The [[STS-107|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]] of 2003, where damage to a wing during launch resulted in total loss upon re-entry.
* The collapse of the multi-span [[I-35W Mississippi River bridge]] on August 1, 2007.

[[File:Vincenzo Camuccini - La morte di Cesare.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Death of Caesar, the well-known climax of [[Shakespeare]]'s play, ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'']]

The '''climax''' (from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word ''κλῖμαξ'', meaning "staircase" and "ladder") or '''turning point''' of a [[narrative|narrative work]] is its point of highest tension and drama, or it is the time when the action starts during which the solution is given.&lt;ref Name="Herrick"&gt;{{cite book  |author1=Robert Herrick |author2=Lindsay Todd Damon  | title = Composition and Rhetoric for Schools  | publisher = Scott, Foresman and Co.  | year=  1902  | location = Original from Harvard University  | pages = 382  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XwABAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA382&amp;dq=Climax+(narrative)+-wikipedia&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1   | doi =    }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite book  |author1=Jefferson Butler Fletcher |author2=George Rice Carpenter  | title = Introduction to Theme-writing  | publisher = Allyn &amp; Bacon  | year=  1893  | location = Original from Harvard University  | pages = 84  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dP0AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Climax+(narrative)+-wikipedia&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1  | doi =    }}&lt;/ref&gt; The climax of a story is a [[literary element]].

== Examples ==
The [[punch line]] of a [[joke]] is an analogy for the climax of a fictional narrative, though the absence of any [[falling action]] is an essential difference, which may reflect the nature of [[humor]] as opposed to the nature of [[drama]].

In non-fictional narrative [[genre]]s, even though the author does not have the same freedom to control the action and "plot" as in works of fiction, the selection of subject matter, degree of detail, and emphasis permit an author to create similar structures, i.e., to construct a dramatization.

In the play ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'', by the famous Greek playwright, [[Euripides]], the climax arrives when Phaedra hears Hippolytus react badly because of her love for him. That is the moment that [[Aphrodite]]'s curse is finally fulfilled, and it is the turning point of the play.

== {{anchor|Anti-climax}} Anticlimax ==
An anticlimax is a situation in a plot in which something which would appear to be difficult to solve is solved through something trivial. For example, destroying a heavily guarded facility would require advanced technology, teamwork, and weaponry for a climax, but for an anticlimax, it may just require pushing a red button which reads, "Emergency Self-Destruct", or simply filling out an eviction notice and destroying the building. A famous example is the ending of ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', where amidst the chaos of the extraterrestrial takeover of planet [[Earth]], the aliens are defeated by the most unexpected organism: the common cold virus. Another example could involve the protagonist faced with insurmountable odds and ultimately being killed without accomplishing his goal, despite what appears to be a turning point for the character.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21513">In [[literary criticism]], '''close reading''' is the careful, sustained interpretation of a brief passage of a text.  A close reading emphasizes the single and the particular over the general, effected by close [[attention]] to individual words, the syntax, the order in which the sentences unfold ideas, as well as formal structures. A truly attentive close reading of a two-hundred-word poem might be thousands of words long without exhausting the possibilities for observation and insight.

== History ==
Literary close reading and commentaries have extensive precedent in the [[exegesis]] of religious texts, and more broadly, [[hermeneutics]] of ancient works. For example, [[Pazand]], a genre of [[middle Persian]] literature, refers to the ''Zend'' (literally: 'commentary'/'translation') texts that offer explanation and close reading of the [[Avesta]], the sacred texts of [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Avesta|last=Williams Jackson|first=A.V.|work=A Library of the World's Best Literature, Ancient and Modern,|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=978-1-60520-191-7|editor-last=Warner|editor-first=Charles Dudley|volume=III|location=New York|pages=1084, 1086|orig-year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scriptural commentaries of the [[Talmud]] offer a commonly cited early predecessor to close reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/25832229|title=Hermeneutics, ancient and modern|last=L.|first=Bruns, Gerald|date=1992|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300054505|location=New Haven|oclc=25832229}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Islamic studies, the close reading of the [[Quran]] has flourished and produced an immense corpus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/browse/encyclopaedia-of-the-quran|title=Exegesis of the Qur'an: Early Modern and Contemporary|last=Wielandt|first=Rotraud|date=|editor-last=McAuliffe|editor-first=Jane Dammen|website=referenceworks.brillonline.com|type=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 August 2018|editor last name=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the closest religious analogy to contemporary literary close reading, and the principal historical connection with its birth, is the rise of the [[higher criticism]], and the evolution of [[textual criticism]] of the Bible in Germany in the late eighteenth century.

In the practice of literary studies, the technique of close reading emerged in 1920s Britain in the work of [[I. A. Richards]], his student [[William Empson]], and the poet [[T.S. Eliot]], all of whom sought to replace an "impressionistic" view of literature then dominant with what Richards called a "practical criticism" focused on language and form. American [[New Critics]] in the 1930s and 1940s anchored their views in similar fashion, and promoted close reading as a means of understanding that the autonomy of the work (often a poem) mattered more than anything else, including authorial intention, the cultural contexts of reception, and most broadly, ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13795373|title=Professing literature : an institutional history|last=Gerald,|first=Graff,|isbn=0226306038|location=Chicago|oclc=13795373}}&lt;/ref&gt;For these critics, including [[Cleanth Brooks]], [[John Crowe Ransom]], and [[Allen Tate]], only close reading, because of its attentiveness to the nuances and interrelation of language and form, could address the work in its complex unity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/297149196|title=American literary criticism since the 1930s|last=1944-|first=Leitch, Vincent B.,|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|others=Leitch, Vincent B., 1944-|isbn=0415778174|edition=2nd|location=London|oclc=297149196}}&lt;/ref&gt;Their influence on American literary criticism and English departments held sway for several decades, and even after New Criticism faded from prominence in American universities in the waning years of the Cold War, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13795373|title=Professing literature : an institutional history|last=Gerald,|first=Graff,|publisher=|year=|isbn=0226306038|location=Chicago|page=227|pages=|oclc=13795373}}&lt;/ref&gt;close reading remained a fundamental, almost naturalized, skill amongst literary critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/10323916|title=The crisis in criticism : theory, literature, and reform in English studies|last=1952-|first=Cain, William E.,|date=1984|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=0801831911|location=Baltimore|oclc=10323916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walhout|first=Mark|date=December 1987|title=The New Criticism and the Crisis of American Liberalism: The Poetics of the Cold War.|url=|journal=College English|volume=49|pages=861-871|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mao|first=Douglas|date=1996|title=The New Critics and the Text-Object|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/30030280|journal=ELH|volume=63|pages=227-254|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;By the turn of the 21st century, efforts to historicize New Critical aesthetics and its apolitical pretense prompted scholars, especially in departments of English, to debate the fate of close reading, asking about its status as a critical practice.

In two of its 2010 bulletins, the American Departments of English (ADE) featured a cluster of articles that attempted to take stock of what the 21st century held for close reading. The articles were motivated, as all of the scholars remarked, by the changes they had observed in the work of their colleagues and students -- as well as in contemporary culture -- that made them think again about why close reading mattered to the study of literature. Jonathan Culler noted that because the discipline had taken close reading for granted, it had disappeared from discussions of the goals of literary criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Culler|first=Jonathan|date=2012|title="The Closeness of Close Reading"|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1632/ade.152.0|journal=ADE Bulletin|volume=152|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1632/ade.152.0|issn=0001-0898|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;For Culler, as for Jane Gallop, that absence needed remedying, and therefore signaled an opportunity for departments of English to renew -- in order to capitalize on -- one of the more distinctive traits of studying literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1632/ade.152.0|journal=ADE Bulletin|volume=152|issue=1|doi=10.1632/ade.152.0|issn=0001-0898}}&lt;/ref&gt; If New Criticism and its isolationist stance had given away to the politicization of literary studies, and if technological developments were changing the very ways in which people read, Culler and Gallop emphasized that the signature of close reading, meticulous attention to the workings of language and form, still had value.N. Katherine Hayles and John Guillory, meanwhile, each interested in the impact of digital media on the ways people read, argued that close reading skills were not only translatable to the digital context, but could also exist productively alongside the hyper-reading that web interfaces and links had generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guillory|first=John|date=2012|title="Close Reading: Prologue and Epilogue"|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1632/ade.152.0|journal=ADE Bulletin|volume=152|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1632/ade.152.0|issn=0001-0898|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayles|first=N.

== Principles and Practice ==
While the New Criticism popularized close reading in universities, it tended to emphasize its principles and offer extended examples rather than prescribe specific methods and practices. This tendency towards what Vincent B. Leitch calls "canonical statements"&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/297149196|title=American literary criticism since the 1930s|last=1944-|first=Leitch, Vincent B.|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|others=Leitch, Vincent B., 1944-|isbn=0415778174|edition=2nd|location=London|oclc=297149196}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in essays and book-length studies, from John Crowe Ransom's "The New Criticism" (1949) and Allen Tate's "A Note on Autotelism" (1949), to Cleanth Brooks' ''[[The Well Wrought Urn]]'' (1947)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4908303|title=The well wrought urn : studies in the structure of poetry|last=1906-1994.|first=Brooks, Cleanth,|date=1947|publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; World|others=ברוקס, קליאנת', 1906-1994.|isbn=0156957051|location=New York|oclc=4908303}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Rene Wellek and Austin Warren's ''[[Theory of Literature]]'' (1949)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1944737|title=Theory of literature|last=René|first=Wellek|date=1956|publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; World|others=Warren, Austin, 1899-1986,|isbn=0156890844|edition=3d|location=New York,|oclc=1944737}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and W.K. Wimsatt's ''The Verbal Icon'' (1954).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/328522|title=The verbal icon : studies in the meaning of poetry|last=1907-1975.|first=Wimsatt, William K. (William Kurtz),|date=1954|publisher=University of Kentucky Press|isbn=0813101115|location=Lexington, Ky.|oclc=328522}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ten chapters of ''The Well Wrought Urn'' thus focus individually on poems across British literary history (John Donne, William Shakespeare, John Milton, Alexander Pope, Thomas Gray, John Keats, William Wordsworth, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, W.B. Yeats, and T.S. Eliot) before concluding with "The Heresy of Paraphrase," in which Brooks abstracts the premises on which his analyses rest. Meanwhile, when Wellek and Warren describe their preference for an "intrinsic" study of literature in ''Theory of Literature'', they refer to examples of elements they claim are crucial to a work -- from euphony, rhythm, and meter to image, metaphor, and myth -- and cite concrete examples of these drawn from literary history, but do not indicate steps by which readers might translate such thinking into their own analyses. Wimsatt takes a mixed approach in ''The Verbal Icon'', combining theoretical chapters ("The Intentional Fallacy," "The Affective Fallacy") with those that discuss concerns he feels are necessary to the study of poetry ("The Concrete Universal," "Symbol and Metaphor," "The Substantive Level," "One Relation of Rhyme to Reason," "When is Variation 'Elegant'?","Verbal Style: Logical and Counterlogical"), but he too leaves it to his readers to imagine how they might deploy these views.

As Culler notes in his essay for the 2010 bulletin of the American Departments of English, this tendency not to make statements of method meant that most students of the New Critics learned by example. Thus in the New Critical classroom, "the charismatic pedagogue could pose a question you had not thought of about relations between form and meaning or point to a textual difficulty that had escaped your attention."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Culler|first=Jonathan|date=2012|title="The Closeness of Close Reading"|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1632/ade.152.0|journal=ADE Bulletin|volume=152|issue=1|pages=23|doi=10.1632/ade.152.0|issn=0001-0898|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than fifty years later, this "closeness of close reading" remains vital to the work of more recent thinkers whose thinking has contributed to the radical changes in literary studies and displaced New Criticism. Of these he cites his contemporary, the deconstructionist Barbara Johnson, who stands out for her claim that the value of close reading lies in its capacity for taking seriously what does not immediately make sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65306717|title="Teaching Deconstructively"|last=Johnson|first=Barbara|date=1985|work=Writing and Reading Differently: Deconstruction and the Teaching of Composition and Literature|publisher=Univ. Press of Kansas|others=|year=1985|isbn=0700002839|editor-last=Atkins|editor-first=George Michael|location=Lawrence, Kansas|pages=140|oclc=65306717|editor-last2=Johnson|editor-first2=Michael L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;Well aware of the stark differences between New Criticism and deconstruction, Culler here brings the two together, suggesting that their shared investments indicate an understanding of close reading worth maintaining.

In French criticism, close reading is similar to ''[[explication de texte]]'', the tradition of textual interpretation in literary study, as proposed by [[Gustave Lanson]]. As an [[analytical technique]], ''close reading'' compares and contrasts the concept of ''distant reading'', the technique for “understanding literature, not by studying particular texts, but by aggregating and analyzing massive amounts of data”, as described, by Kathryn Schulz, in “What is Distant Reading?”, an article about the literary scholar [[Franco Moretti]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/books/review/the-mechanic-muse-what-is-distant-reading.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 "What is Distant Reading?" | New York Times article by Kathryn Schulz June 24, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Brooks's discussion of John Keats's "Ode to a Grecian Urn" embodies his use of close reading. In "Keats's Sylvan Historian," he finds the controversy over the poem's famous lines misplaced, and insists instead that "the ambiguity" of "Beauty is truth, truth beauty -- that is all/Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know" is best understood as an expression of the urn itself (151-153). The poem pursues this ambiguity, he writes, in lines that describe the urn on the one hand as a "bride of quietness" and a "foster-child of silence" and on the other, a "sylvan historian" (155). In this way the poem describes the urn in paradoxical terms much as the urn utters a paradoxical line. Brooks then pursues this logic by considering how "sylvan historian" might not only describe the urn as a kind of historian but also the kind of history the urn is said to tell. Further, if he claims that this history is uncertain because it's not clear "what men or gods" feature in it, he continues that line of thinking as he proceeds through the ode's stanzas: when he emphasizes that the "unheard melodies" of the figures depicted on the urn's face are "sweeter than any audible music," that "action goes on though the actors are motionless," that "the maiden, always to be kissed, never actually kissed," that the "boughs...cannot shed their leaves," and when he claims that this "ironic undercurrent" only increases over the course of the poem, to culminate in those infamous lines (156-159, 164). From following the poem in this way, Brooks arrives at the assertion that his interpretation is "derived from the context of the "Ode" itself" (164).

Brooks's close reading is typical of the New Critical investment in the textual object alone. Yet scholars have also found close reading productive for more politically and socially invested work, thereby refusing the New Critical belief in literary transcendence while seizing on the care with which it treated textuality. In ''The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagination'' (1979), best known as one of the earliest statements of feminist literary criticism, Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar deployed close reading to make a case for the distinctiveness of the female literary imagination. The sixteen chapters of ''Madwoman'' thus pursue their arguments -- that women writers expressed their anxiety about authorship, their rage over being constrained to docile femininity, their canny encoding of their patriarchal critique -- with the attention to language, imagery, and form Gilbert and Gubar had been trained to wield as graduate students in the late 1960s. New Critical echoes are thus evident in the individual chapters devoted to close readings of Mary Shelley's ''Frankenstein'', Emily Bronte's ''Wuthering Heights'', Charlotte Bronte's ''The Professor'', ''Jane'' ''Eyre'', ''Shirley'', and ''Villette'', but so is the political innovation. Reviewers -- academic and mainstream -- recognized this trait, describing the two scholars as “gnostic heretics who claim to have found the secret code that unlocks the mysteries in old texts” (Schreiber 11)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schreiber|first=Le Anne|date=December 9, 1979|title="I'm Nobody, Who Are You?"|url=|journal=The New York Times Review of Books|volume=|pages=11, 32-3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;and their interpretations as a "skillful joint peeling away of the layers" of women's writing" (129).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolodny|first=Annette|date=March 1980|title=Rev. of The Madwoman in the Attic|url=|journal=American Literature|volume=52.1|pages=128-132|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an even more extreme example, [[Jacques Derrida]] in ''Ulysses Gramophone'' devotes more than eighty pages to the word "yes" in James Joyce's novel ''Ulysses'', an effort which [[J. Hillis Miller]] describes as a "hyperbolic, extravagant... explosion" of the technique of close reading.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J.

The push for more close-reading instruction in primary and secondary education is partially due to increased feedback from college professors in the early-mid 2000s that students were arriving in university classrooms with few comprehension skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/dec12/vol70/num04/Closing-in-on-Close-Reading.aspx|title=Closing in on Close Reading - Educational Leadership|last=ASCD|website=www.ascd.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased demand for students to acquire concrete skills in high school that they would need in transitioning to higher education and to adult life culminated in the creation of the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|Common Core State Standards]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.corestandards.org/about-the-standards/|title=About the Standards {{!}} Common Core State Standards Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=www.corestandards.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there has been a push for English Language Arts teachers, especially at the secondary level, to help students develop close-reading strategies. Several of the English Language Arts (ELA) Standards for Reading Literature require students to be able to cite direct textual evidence, and to analyze words in context. For example, CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.9-10.4 asks students to "Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in the text, including figurative and connotative meanings; analyze the cumulative impact of specific word choices on meaning and tone (e.g., how the language evokes a sense of time and place; how it sets a formal or informal tone)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/RL/9-10/|title=English Language Arts Standards » Reading: Literature » Grade 9-10 {{!}} Common Core State Standards Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=www.corestandards.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strategies ===
Today, as most states have adopted the Common Core Standards,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.corestandards.org/standards-in-your-state/|title=Standards in Your State {{!}} Common Core State Standards Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=www.corestandards.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is an increasing number of resources designed to help teachers instruct and implement close-reading strategies in their classrooms. In 2012, Kylene Beers and Robert E. Probst published ''Notice &amp; Note: Strategies for Close Reading'', which established six "signposts" that alert readers to significant moments in a work of literature and encourage students to read closely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heinemann.com/shared/onlineresources/e04693/noticenote_flyer.pdf|title=Notice &amp; Note: Strategies for Close Reading|last=Beers|first=Kylene|date=|website=Heinemann|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another resource, developed by Beth Burke ([[National Board Certified Teacher|NBCT]]) for the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' NIE (Newspaper in Education), presents the steps involved in close reading and how to [[Lev Vygotsky|scaffold]] the strategies for students. She recommends using the Gradual Release Model&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nieonline.com/tbtimes/downloads/CCSS_reading.pdf|title=Closing in on Close Reading|last=Burke|first=Beth|date=|website=Tampa Bay Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in instruction, beginning by modeling a close reading in front of the class, then having students work on the strategy in groups before attempting it alone. 

Additional ways to support students in close-reading instruction include providing [[Graphic organizer|graphic organizers]] that help them group their ideas with textual evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edu.wyoming.gov/downloads/assessments/2014/close-reading-graphic-organizer.pdf|title=Close Reading Graphic Organizer|last=|first=|date=|website=State of Wyoming|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conformal antennas were developed in the 1980s as [[avionics]] antennas integrated into the curving skin of military aircraft to reduce [[aerodynamic drag]], replacing conventional antenna designs which project from the aircraft surface.&lt;ref name="Josefsson" /&gt;   Military aircraft and missiles are the largest application of conformal antennas, but they are also used in some civilian aircraft, military ships and land vehicles.  As the cost of the required processing technology comes down, they are being considered for use in civilian applications such as train antennas, car radio antennas, and [[cellular base station]] antennas, to save space and also to make the antenna less visually intrusive by integrating it into existing objects.

==How it works==
Conformal antennas are a form of [[phased array]] antenna.  They are composed of an array of many identical small flat antenna elements, such as [[dipole antenna|dipole]], [[horn antenna|horn]], or [[patch antenna]]s, covering the surface.  At each antenna the current from the transmitter passes through a [[phase shifter]] device which are all controlled by a [[microprocessor]] (computer).   By controlling the [[phase (waves)|phase]] of the feed current, the nondirectional radio waves emitted by the individual antennas can be made to combine in front of the antenna  by the process of [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]],  forming a strong beam (or beams) of radio waves pointed in any desired direction.  In a [[radio receiver|receiving]] antenna the weak individual radio signals received by each antenna element are combined in the correct phase to enhance signals coming from a particular direction, so the antenna can be made sensitive to the signal from a particular station and reject interfering signals from other directions.

In a conventional phased array the individual antenna elements are mounted on a flat surface.   In a conformal antenna, they are mounted on a curved surface, and the phase shifters also compensate for the different phase shifts caused by the varying path lengths of the radio waves due to the location of the individual antennas on the curved surface.     Because the individual antenna elements must be small, conformal arrays are typically limited to high [[frequency|frequencies]] in the [[ultrahigh frequency|UHF]] or [[microwave]] range, where the [[wavelength]] of the waves is small enough that small antennas can be used.

'''Deadpan''', '''dry humor''' or '''dry wit'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rishel|first=Mary Ann|title=Writing humor|year=2002|publisher=Wayne State University Press|location=Detroit|isbn=0-8143-2959-4|page=166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sBsC3ItxoYQC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=%22dry+wit%22&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=y2tJT83UMIaAOoiwzewN&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22dry%20wit%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the deliberate display of a lack of or no emotion, commonly as a form of [[Comedy|comedic]] delivery to contrast with the ridiculousness of the subject matter. The delivery is meant to be blunt, [[ironic]], [[laconic]], or apparently unintentional.

==Etymology==
The term ''deadpan'' first emerged as an [[adjective]] or [[adverb]] in the 1920s, as a [[compound word]] combining "dead" and "pan" (a [[slang]] term for the face). The oldest usage recorded by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' comes from ''[[The New York Times]]'' (1928), which defines the term as "playing a role with expressionless face".&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''. [http://oed.com/view/Entry/47677 "dead-pan, adj., n., adv., and v."] Second edition, 1989; online version December 2011. accessed 17 February 2012. First published in ''A Supplement to the OED I'', 1972&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this usage is in a scene from the 1934 film ''[[The Gay Bride]]'' in which a [[gangster]] tells a man on the other end of a phone conversation to "give it a dead pan" (with the emphasis on "pan"), so that the man does not inadvertently alert anyone else in the room as to the importance of what the gangster is about to say. The usage of deadpan as a [[verb]] ("to speak, act, or utter in a deadpan manner; to maintain a dead pan") is recorded at least as far back as 1942.&lt;ref name="oed"/&gt;

==Examples==

Early in his vaudeville days, [[Buster Keaton]] developed his deadpan expression.  Keaton realized that audiences responded better to his stony expression than when he smiled, and he carried this style into his silent film career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/deadpan-the-comedy-of-buster-keaton|title=Deadpan: the comedy of Buster Keaton|work=[[Telescope (TV series)|Telescope]]|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|date=17 April 1964|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980 film ''[[Airplane!]]'' was performed almost entirely in deadpan.&lt;ref name="MIL"&gt;{{cite news| last=Dudek| first=Duane| title=25 years and still laughing; Airplane!' maintains its cruising| work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]| url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=332493|accessdate=23 February 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430053901/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=332493 |archivedate=30 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many popular American sitcoms use deadpan expressions to deliver dry humor, including ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', and ''[[My Name Is Earl]]''. More recent examples are [[Andre Braugher]] as Captain Raymond Holt from the TV show ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]'', [[Jennette McCurdy]] as Sam Puckett in ''[[iCarly]]'', and [[Louis C.K.]] in ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]''. Another example is the comedy of [[Steven Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Thomas | first=E.C. | title=The Everything Big Book of Jokes: Hundreds of the Shortest, Longest, Silliest, Smartest, Most Hilarious Jokes You've Never Heard! | publisher=Adams Media | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-4405-7698-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1zrsDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16 | access-date=June 29, 2017 | page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dry humor is often confused with [[highbrow]] or [[egghead]] humor, because the humor in dry humor does not exist in the words or delivery. Instead, the listener must look for humor in the contradiction between words, delivery and [[Context (language use)|context]]. Failure to include the context or to identify the contradiction results in the listener finding the dry humor unfunny. However, the term "deadpan" itself actually refers only to the method of delivery.

'''Design Studies''' is an [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]] that pursues a critical understanding of [[design]] and its effects through analytical and practical modes of inquiry. Its origins can be traced to [[design history]] where the field first got its start&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buchanan|first1=Richard|title=Design Research and the New Learning|journal=Design Issues|date=2001|volume=17,|issue=4|pages=3–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; before slowly expanding to include larger themes and more varied subject matters. In that light, Victor Margolin, one of the founders of the discipline in the US, proposes Design Studies as a term that comprises various design researches and relates them to one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Margolin|first1=Victor|title=Design History or Design Studies: Subject Matter and Methods|journal=Design Issues|date=1995|volume=11|issue= 1|pages=4–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a highly interdisciplinary field, Design Studies references many scholarship paradigms and focuses on how design knowledge is developed, articulated and communicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cross|first1=Nigel|title=Design Research: A Disciplined Conversation|date=1999|volume=15|issue=02|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It therefore incorporates an expansive set of evolving methodologies and theories that are drawn from key thinkers and theorists from the field itself (such as [[Victor Margolin]], Clive Dilnot, and [[Richard Buchanan (academic)|Richard Buchanan]]), but also from several related fields such as, the [[humanities]] ([[literature]], [[art]], [[Visual Studies|visual studies]], [[cultural studies]]), the [[social science]]s ([[anthropology]], [[political science]]s, and [[sociology]]), the [[science]]s ([[engineering]], [[Materials science|material]] studies, [[neurology]], [[technology]] studies). Design Studies also generates scholarly work in the fields of [[architecture]], [[urban planning]] and [[Urban policy|policy]], and spatial studies. Design Studies not only considers objects, places and systems, it investigates their meanings, contexts, possibilities and consequences.

Design Studies recognizes that design, as a practice, is merely one facet of a much larger paradigm. It examines, probes, and questions the role of design in shaping past and present personal and cultural values, especially in light of how they shape the future. The subjects of Design Studies are inherently fluid while being anchored to a core body of work and scholarship that revolves around broader themes such as [[ethics]], environmental sustainment, and [[social sustainability]].

The American author, editor and educator Susan Yelavich, encapsulates the terrain of Design Studies as embracing "two broad perspectives—one that focuses inward on the nature of design and one that looks outward to the circumstances that shape it, and conversely, the circumstances design changes, intentionally or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adht.parsons.edu/designstudies/double_profile_of_design_studie/|title=The Double Profile of Design Studies - Design Studies|website=adht.parsons.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== History of Design Studies ===
The history of the field of Design Studies can be traced to the early 1960s in England. In 1962, a “Conference on Design Methods” held in London led to the emergence of the [[Design Research Society]], bringing together academics and practitioners who shared interests in new approaches to the process of designing.&lt;ref name="Forty Years of Design Research"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cross|first1=Nigel|title=Forty Years of Design Research|journal=Design Studies|date=2007|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=https://www.designresearchsociety.org/cpages/about|website=Design Research Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, a series of conferences were held that helped continue the development of the [http://www.drs2016.org/222/ Design Methods Movement (DMM)]— a product of the post-war optimism of the 1950s, cancelled in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cross, Margolin|first1=Nigel, Victor|title=A History of Design Methodology, Design Methodology and Relationships with Science|date=1993|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement focused on the comparison between science and design and tried to determine methods that distinguished design as an important academic field apart from the realm of art and art history. However, in 1980 at the Design Research Society’s [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/005784314 Design:Science:Method] conference concluded that there was not much for design to learn from science, instead, science had something to learn from design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cross, Margolin|first1=Nigel, Victor|title=A History of Design Methodology, Design Methodology and Relationships with Science|date=1993|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this point, design became a discipline of study “based on the view that design has its own things to know and its own ways of knowing them.” This stance was promulgated in the first issue of ''[https://www.journals.elsevier.com/design-studies Design Studies]'' with the launch of a series of articles in its pages called “Design as a Discipline''.''”&lt;ref name="Forty Years of Design Research"/&gt; (''[https://www.journals.elsevier.com/design-studies Design Studies, The Interdisciplinary Journal of Design Research]'' as it is now known, was first published as Design Studies 1, no.1 in July 1979. Produced by the publisher Reed Elsevier known since 2015 as [[Elsevier]]). The series began with [[L. Bruce Archer|Bruce Archer]], and his 1979 essay, “Whatever became of Design Methodology?”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Archer|first1=Bruce|title=Whatever Became of Design Methodology?|journal=Design Studies|date=1979|volume=1|issue=1|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his accompanying article from the same issue titled "The Three Rs," Archer places [[Design]] with a capital D as a third extreme in an education triangle with the [[Science]]s and [[Humanities]] situating design, though not exclusively, within acts of configuration, composition, meaning, value, and purpose in man-made phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Archer|first1=Bruce|title=The Three Rs|journal=Design Studies|date=1979|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debates about the discipline of design and design research continued through the 1980s and were significantly reignited in 1995 when [[Victor Margolin]], an American scholar who contributed to the development of design history, argued for a new approach to “Design Studies.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Margolin|first1=Victor|title=Design History or Design Studies: Subject Matter and Methods|journal=Design Issues|date=1995|volume=11|issue= 1|page=14|doi=10.2307/1511610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margolin referred to the "dynamic crossings of intellectual boundaries" when describing the interdisciplinary nature of intellectual practice at the time. He felt that early design historians should question "whether design history as it [had] been constituted...[was] a viable enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Margolin|first1=Victor|title=Design History or Design Studies: Subject Matter and Methods|journal=v|date=1995|volume=11|issue= 1|pages=4–15|doi=10.2307/1511610}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gooding, J. V., “Design History in Britain From the 1970's to 2012: Context, Formation and Development, Ph.D. Dissertation University of Northumbria, Newcastle (January 2012) p. 200-203&lt;/ref&gt;

Margolin defines design studies as a field of inquiry that addresses how we make and use products and how we have done so in the past. These products compromise the domain in the artificial. Design studies addresses ideas of product conception and planning, production, form, distribution, and use. It considers these topics in the present as well as in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Margolin|first1=Victor|title=The Politics of the Artificial: essays on design and design studies|date=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Margolin's position triggered counter arguments about how to characterize the study of design. A battle in print began with his article titled, “Design history or design studies: subject matter and methods” published in the international journal ''Design Studies (Design Studies was the journal of the [[Design Research Society]], founded in the UK in 1966; the journal itself has been in publication since 1979).'' This controversial topic had resonance in Britain where [[Adrian Forty]]’s response appeared in the pages of the ''[[Journal of Design History]]'', in which he argued in favor of research that led to the understanding of quality judgements defining good design "as an entirely legitimate field for design historical research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=DEBATE: A Reply to Victor Margolin|journal=Journal of Design History|date=1 January 1993|volume= 6|issue= 2|pages=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of this debate was made clear by the fact that it was reprinted in a special issue of ''[[Design Issues]]'' in 1995 where it refocused attention on "some of the controversies and problems that surround the seemingly simple task of telling the history of design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buchanan, Doordan &amp; Margolin|first1=Richard, Dennis, Victor|title=Introduction|journal=v|date=Spring 1995|volume=11|issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift from Design History to Design Studies started to occur as the research and approaches to the field began to focus on broader questions of meaning, authority and power, in other words, with the dynamics surrounding and enabling the practice of design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whiteley|first1=Nigel|title=Design History or Design Studies|date=1995|volume=1|issue= 1|pages=38–42|doi=10.2307/1511614}}&lt;/ref&gt; The realization came that Design History is only “but one component of what goes on in studying design, and to claim that all that is going on now could use the umbrella term 'design history’ is not tenable.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whiteley|first1=Nigel|title=Design History or Design Studies|date=1995|volume=1|issue= 1|page=40|doi=10.2307/1511614}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new field of Design Studies would now include not only design history, but also allow for a dialogue about “issues of product conception and planning, production, form, distribution, and use” in a historical and contemporary context.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Foundational Figures ===
[[L. Bruce Archer]]. (1922-2005) was a British mechanical engineer and later Professor of [[Design Research]] at the [[Royal College of Art]] who championed research in design, and helped to establish design as an academic discipline.

[[John Heskett]] (1937-2014) In the late 1970s, Heskett became a prominent member of a group of academics based in several of Britain's art schools (then part of the polytechnics) who helped develop the discipline of design history and theory, later to become subsumed under the broader banner of Design Studies. In subsequent years, as design became a global practice increasingly valued by corporations and governments alike, design history became, along with design pedagogy, one of the nation's most successful academic exports. Heskett brought his deep knowledge of economics, politics and history to the project and worked alongside scholars from other disciplines to communicate the meaning and function of that increasingly important concept, "design", both past and present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sparke|first1=Penny|title=John Heskett obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/12/john-heskett|website=the guardian|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development Outside Anglo-Saxon ===
According to Ahmed Ansari, Danah Abdulla, Ece Canli, Mahmoud Keshavarz, Matthew Kiem, Pedro Oliveira, Luiza Prado, and Tristan Schultz who make up the ''[http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/ Decolonising Design Group]'', “Coloniality is not an abstract concept nor is it a subject to be examined from a comfortable distance. It is something that affects our communities, our countries and our peoples every single day. It is a continuous process of domination and violence to which we are submitted. It demeans our knowledge, subjugates our bodies, and renders our lives arduous.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decolonising Design, A Statement on the Design Research Society Conference 2016|url=http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/statements/2016/drs2016statement/#more-1|website=Decolonising Design|accessdate=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established via their online blog “[http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/ Decolonising Design],” this collective of design researchers, academics, and practitioners working in and with the fields of Design Studies and Design Research firmly believe that “decolonisation is imperative for survival.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decolonising Design, A Statement on the Design Research Society Conference 2016|url=http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/statements/2016/drs2016statement/#more-1|website=Decolonising Design|accessdate=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Decolonising Design Group's effort was born from their frustrations with academia during the events that led up to their withdrawal from the 2016 Design Research Society Conference and driven by their desire to engage in a profound debate of the colonial ethos of design and research. The collective believes it is, “not sufficient for design studies and design research to simply include a greater ‘diversity of perspectives’ as a means to delay and offset demands for radical systemic change.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decolonising Design, A Statement on the Design Research Society Conference 2016|url=http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/statements/2016/drs2016statement/#more-1|website=Decolonising Design|accessdate=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the purpose of transforming the agenda of design studies and design research, the group organized a symposium on decolonization titled “Intersectional Perspectives on Design, Politics &amp; Power” which was held at the School of Arts and Communication, Malmö University, Sweden on 14–15 November 2016. For these [relatively] young academics, the field of design studies is not “geared towards delivering the kinds of knowledge and understanding that are adequate to addressing the systemic problems that arise from the coloniality of power.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Editorial Statement|url=http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/statements/2016/editorial/#more-1|website=Decolonising Design|accessdate=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They argue that design history and design research tends to have the most influence from the triad of Western Europe, North America, and Japan.&lt;ref name="Design studies: a reader"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Matthew|title=Design studies: a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford:|pages=20–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect tends to be in line with the notion that history is written by the victors and thus design history is written by the economically powerful.&lt;ref name="Design studies: a reader"/&gt; They point to concurrent histories outside of the western context. For instance, Hong Kong has a unique system of design that was established prior to the economic growth of the Pearl River delta which can be found in the continuities of design in product types and styles, manufacturing and printing companies, and families of artist-designers.&lt;ref name="Design studies: a reader"/&gt; Or in Cuba for instance, where the origins of design was influenced by the crisis of “modern movement ideology and the ideologies oh how to escape underdevelopment.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Design studies: a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1847882363|pages=25–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These countries lie on the periphery of the westernized view of design history and design studies and in some instances may have suffered in their adaptation of European modernity. As such, [[Gui Bonsiepe]], a German designer, teacher, and writer, suggested that “Decolonization in all its manifestations, economic, technological and cultural, should be the goal of project activity in the periphery.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Design studies: a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1847882363|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for understanding design as a global and multicultural phenomenon is also argued by Jonathan M. Woodham, [[Victor Margolin]], and Anna Calvera in Denise Whitehouse’s collection of essays.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|title=Design studies: a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1847882363|pages=54–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together their aim is to “create a theoretical narrative that brings intellectual logic to the multiple stories of how different countries… have negotiated the process of Westernization and the idea of design according to their specific economic, geographical, political, and cultural circumstances.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

As Whitehouse points out, “While many countries produce local histories of design, the output is uneven and often driven by nationalist and trade agendas.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Academic groups like the Japanese [http://www.designhistoryforum.org/ Design History Forum] and [http://www.ub.edu/icdhs/ The International Committee for Design History and Studies (ICDHS)] draw together both western and non-western, post-communist, postcolonial, Asian, and Southern Hemisphere, “to remap the scope and narrative concerns of design history.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

== Approaches and Scope ==
Design Studies thinks ambitiously about design, beyond its professional enclaves, and studies the significance and consequences of design activity in the modern world. It looks at design as a complex and multifarious activity and examines the forces that design exerts in, and on, the world—forces design sets in motion but does not control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yelavich|first1=Susan|title=What Is/Are Design Studies?|url=http://adht.parsons.edu/designstudies/what-is-are-design-studies/|website=|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field of Design Studies views design as both the embodiment of the imminent future (by virtue of behaviors it triggers and resources it depletes) and as a means of envisioning alternative futures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yelavich|first1=Susan|title=What Is/Are Design Studies?|url=http://adht.parsons.edu/designstudies/what-is-are-design-studies/|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because Design Studies is interdisciplinary (moving between disciplines), multi-disciplinary (utilizing multiple disciplines in its process and methods) and transdisciplinary (combining disciplines in creating new disciplinary structures),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NC State|title=What is Design Studies, Anyway?|url=https://design.ncsu.edu/design-studies/|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  its approaches and scopes are not constrained by any boundaries of academic disciplines. It is promiscuous and draws on the knowledge of philosophy, sociology, anthropology, literature, cultural theory, politics and the sciences to ask questions of what is design, and how can we comprehend its acting in the world by analyzing its possibilities and limits.

As an organized field of study, Design Studies is substantiated by its own academic and professional discourse and theoretical perspectives concerning the ways we think about design—its nature, purpose, agency, configuration, engagement, deployment, place, responsibilities, ethics, politics, problems, environment, sustainment, potentialities and alternative futures. It focuses on describing the why, the how and the what of design. It does not limit its inquiry to prescriptive definitions of what design is supposed to be, but instead it aims to understand (and study) the possibilities of what design can achieve and uses varied methodologies to explore the delineations and synergies between academic inquiry, critical theory and design practice. Its scholars explore the coherent structures and intellectual parameters of how design is encountered in the world, as well as analyze which different modes of contemporary practice are rethinking design to propose and realize alternative futures.

== Subject(s) of Design Studies ==
As an organized field of study, Design Studies is a discipline concerned with design as a practice and as an intervention in the world. It is substantiated by its own academic and professional discourses and theoretical perspectives concerning ways to think about design—its nature, purpose, agency, configuration, engagement, deployment, place, responsibilities, ethics, politics, problems, environment, sustainment, potentialities and alternative futures. It does not limit its inquiry to prescriptive definitions of what design is supposed to be, but instead it aims to understand (and study) the possibilities of what design can achieve by using various methodologies to analyze the delineations and synergies between academic inquiry, design practice and critical theory.

Design Studies analyzes how different modes of contemporary practice are rethinking design to propose and realize alternative futures using approaches such as those conventions listed under [[design]] as well as:

== Issues and Concepts in Design Studies ==
Design Studies asks us to think about the meaning of design. It studies the influence of designers and the effects design has on citizens and the environment.&lt;ref name="Design studies : a reader"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/268792485|title=Design studies : a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|others=Clark, Hazel., Brody, David Eric.|isbn=9781847882363|edition=English|location=Oxford|oclc=268792485}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Margolin distinguishes a degree in Design from a degree in Design Studies by saying that “the former is about producing design, while the latter is about reflecting on design as it has been practiced, is currently practiced, and how it might be practiced.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drs2016.org/009/|title=Design Research: What is it? What is it for?|website=DRS2016|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design Studies urges to rethink design as a process, as a practice, and as a generator or products and systems that gives lives meaning and sustains our economic and political systems. Design thinking invites to explore the complexities inherent to the task of thinking about design.&lt;ref name="Design studies : a reader"/&gt; Design Studies is concerned with the relationship between design and gender, design and race, and design and culture. It studies issues such as ethics, sustainment (social and environmental) and works with concepts such as agency and the artificial.

=== Issues ===

==== Ethics ====
Design has the capacity of structuring life in certain ways and thus design should result in the greater good for individuals and society but it doesn’t always do so. Ethics deals with how our actions affect others. Design Studies sees ethics as central to design. Tony Fry, a leading figure in Design Studies claims, “Design is quintessentially an ethical process but despite this recognition that ethics is integral to design in many ways, design ethics remains ‘massively underdeveloped and even in its crudest forms remains marginal within design education.” It is important to involve ethics in the design process, especially as the world we inhabit is increasingly becoming artificial.&lt;ref name="Design studies : a reader"/&gt;

Clive Dilnot’s essay, [https://www.amazon.com/Design-Studies-Reader-Hazel-Clark/dp/1847882366 ''Ethics in Design –'' ''Ten Questions'']'','' explores why we need ethics in design, what is the relationship between design and ethics. Dilnot writes that ethics should as a responsibility, as the ability of the designer to address the public as citizens and not as consumers or as the infusing of “humane intelligence” into the made environment, assume the possibility of truly human – humane, sustainable ways or making and remaking the world.&lt;ref name="Design studies : a reader"/&gt;

==== Sustainment: Environmental and Social ====

=== Concepts ===
==== The Artificial ====
Clive Dilnot goes further and clarifies that the artificial is by no means confined to technology. Today, it is combination of technical systems, the symbolic realm, including mind and the realm of our transformations and transmutations of nature. He gives the example of a [[genetically modified tomato]] that is neither purely natural nor purely artificial. It belongs rather to the extended realms of living things that are, as human beings ourselves are, a hybrid between these conditions – Neither nature nor the artificial nor the human are today pure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/858895940|title=Design as future-making|others=Yelavich, Susan,|isbn=9780857858399|location=London|oclc=858895940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design Studies scholars also reference sociologist [[Bruno Latour]] when investigating the dynamics of the artificial. Latour's concept of [[Actor–network theory|Actor-Network Theory]] (ANT) portrays the social as an interdependent network of human individual actors and actants, which are non-human, non-individual entities. ANT aims at accounting for the very essence of societies and natures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Latour|first=Bruno|date=1996|title=On actor-network theory: A few clarifications|jstor=40878163|journal=Soziale Welt|volume=47|issue=4|pages=369–381|doi=10.2307/40878163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Agency ====
Design plays a constitutive role in everyday life. We engage design with all of our senses – The things we see and read, the objects we use, and the places we inhabit are all designed. These products (all artificial because they are catalyzed by people) constitute an increasingly large part of the world. The built environment is the physical infrastructure that enables behavior, activity, routines, habits, and rituals, which affect our agency. Jamer Hunt defines the built environment as the combination of all design work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51931174|title=Strangely familiar : design and everyday life|date=2003|publisher=Walker Art Center|others=Blauvelt, Andrew, 1964-, Walker Art Center., Carnegie Museum of Art., Musée de l'Hospice Comtesse.|isbn=9780935640755|edition=1st|location=Minneapolis, Minn.|oclc=51931174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Methods  ==
=== Design Ethnography  ===

This form of research requires the scholar to partake in the use of, or observe others use, a designed object or system. Design-based Ethnography has become a common tool where design is observed as a social practice. It describes a process in which a researcher will partake in traditional observant style ethnography, and observe potential users complete activities that can inform design opportunities and solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://designobserver.com/article.php?id=5467|title=Design's Ethnographic Turn|work=Design Observer|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other ethnographic techniques used by Design Studies scholars would fall more in line with anthropologists usage of the method. These techniques are observant and [[Participant observation|participant ethnography]]. The observant style requires the scholar to observe in an unobtrusive manner. Observations are recorded and further analyzed. The participant style requires the scholar to partake in the activities with their subject. This tactic enables the scholar to record what they see, but also what they themselves experience.

=== Actor-Network Theory  ===

While it remains a broader theory or concept Actor-Network theory can be used by Design Studies scholars as a research framework. When using this method, scholars will assess a designed object and consider the physical and nonphysical interactions which revolve around the object. The scholar will analyze what the object’s impact is on psychological, societal, economical, and political worlds.

=== Semiotics, Rhetorical Analysis, and Discourse Theory  ===

Design Studies scholars may also analyze or research a designed object or system by studying it in terms of images and their various meanings. Based in [[representation (arts)|representation]] and meaning-making, semiotics as pertinent design as an act of communication between the designer, the thing, and the user or users. This concept branches out into a rhetorical analysis of the designed thing. Scholars such as [[Richard Buchanan (academic)|Richard Buchanan]], argue that design can be studied in such a way due to the existence of a design argument.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Richard|date=1985|title=Declaration by Design: Rhetoric, Argument, and Demonstration in Design Practice|url=|journal=Design Issues|volume=2|pages=4–22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The design argument is made up by the designer, the user, and the applicability to “practical life.”&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  The scholar would pull these segments apart and thoroughly analyze each component and their interactions. Finally, [[discourse analysis]] or a [[Foucauldian discourse analysis]] can be adopted by the Design Studies scholar to further explore the above components. A Foucauldian approach specifically will analyze the power structures put in place, manipulated by, or used within a designed thing or object. This process can be particularly useful when the scholar intends to understand if the designed thing has agency or enables others to have agency.

[[File:Fairtrade Certification Mark.svg|thumb|[[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]]]]

The '''Fairtrade certification''' initiative was created to form a new method for [[trade|economic trade]]. This method takes an ethical standpoint, and considers the [[Producer (agriculture)|producers]] first.

Several attempts to market fair trade products were observed in the 1960s and 1970s, fair trade sales became widespread with the Max Havelaar labeling initiative in 1988 and the establishment of Fairtrade International in 1997. Fairtrade sales prior to labeling initiatives were contained to relatively small world shops (also called charity shops), operated by alternative trading organizations (ATOs) such as Oxfam and Traidcraft.

At the initiative of Mexican coffee farmers, the first fair trade labeling initiative, Stichting Max Havelaar, was launched in the Netherlands on November 15, 1988, by Nico Roozen, Frans van der Hoff, and Dutch ecumenical development agency Solidaridad. In 1992, the organization was founded by Michael Gidney. The initiative offered coffee producers following various social and environmental standards an above market price for their crop. The coffee, originating from the UCIRI cooperative in Mexico, was imported by Dutch company Van Weely, roasted by Neuteboom, sold directly to shops and, for the first time, to mainstream retailers across the Netherlands.

The initiative was groundbreaking as for the first time Fairtrade coffee was being offered to a larger consumer segment. Fairtrade labeling certification provided some assurance that the products were really benefiting the farm workers at the end of the supply chain.

Fairtrade International started with the coffee industry, but now covers a range of products such as [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[fruit]], [[cotton]], [[flower]]s, [[tea]] and others. The established buyers of these products make up a [[niche market]], which makes marketing for Fairtrade a challenge.

As of 2016, 1,411 producer organizations in 73 developing countries were Fairtrade certified, representing over 1.66 million [[farmers]] and workers. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://monitoringreport2017.fairtrade.net/en/|title=Monitoring the Scope and Benefits of Fairtrade: Impact Report 2017 - Fairtrade Monitoring Report - 9th Edition|website=Fairtrade Monitoring Report - 9th Edition|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The fair trade movement stemmed from an initiative established by the Dutch development agency, Solidaridad, and aimed to create more equality between coffee producers and roasters. The agency recognized that the producers were not being treated fairly, and strived to create a more ethical system to trade. 

The Max Havelaar seal, which was based on a fictional character, was established "to license existing roasters and retailers who complied with its fair trade criteria".The seal provided specific benefits for cooperatives of small coffee producers in Mexico, with the aim of balancing the production of crops to be exported, as well as crops for the local population. The four benefits in this early model of the fairtrade initiative were:

#  A guaranteed minimum price to protect producers from any potential falls in the global market.
#  An additional 10% of the market price for their investment in social and environmental projects.
#  A 60% advance to producers to reduce the pressure of selling their product "immediately after harvest when its price is lowest"
#  A commitment by roasters to eliminate any other parties within the supply chain, with the aim of dealing more directly with producers.
The initiative was a great financial success and was replicated in several other markets: in the ensuing years, similar non-profit Fairtrade labelling organizations were set up in other European countries and North America, called "Max Havelaar" (in [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[France]]), "Transfair" (in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Italy]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Japan]]), or carrying a national name: "Fairtrade Mark" in the [[UK]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], "Rättvisemärkt" in [[Sweden]], and "Reilu kauppa" (Finnish) or "Rejäl handel" ([[Finland Swedish|Swedish]]) in [[Finland]].

Initially, while the Max Havelaars and the Transfairs co-operated product by product with equivalent standards and producer lists there was no contractual agreement to ensure global standards. In 1994, a process of convergence among the labelling organizations&amp;nbsp;– or "LIs" (for "Labelling Initiatives")&amp;nbsp;– started with the establishment of a TransMax working group, culminating in 1997 in the creation of [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]], now simply known as Fairtrade International (FLO). FLO is an umbrella organization whose mission is to set the Fairtrade Standards, support, inspect and certify disadvantaged producers and harmonize the Fairtrade message across the movement.

In 2002, FLO launched a new [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]], effectively replacing most previous Max Havelaar and TransFair certification marks. The goals of the launch were to improve the visibility of the Mark on supermarket shelves, facilitate cross-border trade and simplify export procedures for both producers and exporters.

Today, all but one labeling initiative have fully adopted the new mark. [[TransFair USA]] has apparently elected to continue with its own [[Fair Trade Certified Mark]] for the time being,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transfairusa.org/content/resources/faq-advanced.php#bluegreen TransFair USA FAQ] - "TransFair USA, has elected to continue using its current label."&lt;/ref&gt; while the Canadian organization currently allows certified products to carry either mark, it is transitioning toward the sole use of the International Fairtrade Certification Mark.

In January 2004, Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International was divided into two independent organizations: Fairtrade International (FLO), which sets Fairtrade Standards and provides producer business support, and FLO-CERT, which inspects and certifies producer organizations. The aim of the split was to ensure the impartiality, the independence of the certification process and compliance with [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 65 standards for product certification bodies.

At present, over 25 labelling initiatives and producer networks are members or associate members of Fairtrade International. There are now FAIRTRADE Certification Marks on dozens of different products, based on FLO's certification for coffee, [[tea]], [[rice]], [[banana]]s, [[mango]]es, [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[cotton]], [[sugar]], [[honey]], [[fruit juice]]s, [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[fruit|fresh fruit]], [[quinoa]], [[herb]]s and [[spice]]s, [[wine]] and [[Football (ball)|footballs]].

In 2009, fair trade coffee was sufficiently mainstream that [[Walmart]], the world's largest retailer began selling it, and pricing it about the same as regular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505144_162-51372457/what-to-buy-at-walmart/ What to Buy at Walmart] 2009; revised 2011; accessed 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fairtrade and Fairmined dual certification for [[gold]] was launched across the United Kingdom on 14 February 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/14/fairtrade-gold?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Fairtrade hallmark sets the gold standard|author=Kate Carter|date=14 February 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a joint scheme between [[The Fairtrade Foundation]] and [[The Association for Responsible Mining]].

==The global market==

The Solidaridad informed large audiences of the mistreatment of coffee producers and poor living conditions in developing countries. They worked with other associations as well as the mass media to spread the message and create an awareness of their fair trade initiative. Because of their efforts, in 1988 the first bag of Max Hevelaar sealed coffee from Mexico was delivered to Holland's Prince Claus, and was launched to be sold in supermarkets throughout Holland. By the 1990s every western European country had established their own national version of the Max Hevelaar initiative.

Between the late 1980s and the mid-1990s, multiple national initiatives following a fair trade system coexisted within Europe, the US, Canada, and Japan.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Nicholls, A., &amp; Opal, C. (2005). Fairtrade certification. In ''Fair trade: Market-driven ethical consumption'' (p. 128). London.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, however, 17 national initiatives joined forces to create one international umbrella organisation called the Fair Trade Organization (FLO). FLO is based in Bonn, Germany, and has quickly become the largest organisation of its kind.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; FLO also has branches and field workers in Africa, Central and South America and China.  The international fair trade label was introduced in 2002 to improve visibility for consumers. The Fairtrade producers did not like the way they were treated.

==Marketing fair trade==
A key part of the fair trade initiative is to inform consumers through innovative marketing. The marketing must create a value proposition for the initiative that encompasses the ethical side, as well as the quality of the product.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

==How it works==
As an example: [[fair trade]] coffee packers in developed countries pay a fee to their country's Fairtrade organization for the right to use the brand and logo. Nearly the entire fee goes to marketing. Packers and retailers can charge as much as they want for the coffee. The coffee has to come from a certified Fairtrade cooperative, which pays certification and inspection fees. The importer is obliged to pay the exporter a base price which keeps the price from sinking below that level. It is sometimes higher than the going world price, but at times when coffee prices are high, it may be lower than the going price. There is an additional "producer premium" (20c/lb for coffee). For a few products, like coffee, there is also a minimum price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade International|title=Fairtrade Standard for Coffee for Small Producer Organizations|date=April 1, 2011|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-01_EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf |page=4|accessdate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cooperatives or other Fairtrade certified firms incur additional costs including increased marketing costs, certification and inspection fees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/35.html|title=Fee System Small Producer Organization - Explanatory Document|year=2011|publisher=FLO-CERT Gmbh|accessdate= January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and costs of conforming to the specifications.

Any deficit after paying these costs means a lower price for farmers, while any surplus from the premium price must be spent on "social projects" for "common goals" organized by the exporting cooperative rather than being an extra payment for farmers.&lt;ref name="EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade International|title=Fairtrade Standard for Coffee for Small Producer Organizations|date=April 1, 2011|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-01_EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf |accessdate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.

Retrieved January 3, 2013, from Fairtrade International: http://www.fairtrade.net/coffee.html.&lt;/ref&gt; These may include the building of classrooms, baseball pitches, or the establishment of women's groups.

Fairtrade farmers have to meet a large range of criteria on production: there are limits on using child labour, pesticides, herbicides, genetically modified products and so on.&lt;ref name="GTS_EN.pdf p11"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V. |date=April 2, 2012 |title=Generic Fairtrade Trade Standard |page=11 |url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf |accessdate=January 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502051837/http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf |archivedate=May 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fairtrade standards==
[[File:FairtradeCertifiedCottonTShirt.jpg|thumb|275px|right|A T-shirt made from Fairtrade certified cotton]]

Fairtrade standards contain minimum requirements that all producer organizations must meet to become certified as well as progress requirements in which producers must demonstrate improvements over time. To become certified Fairtrade producers, the cooperatives and their member farmers must operate to certain standards laid down by Fairtrade International. FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;ref name="FLOCERT"&gt;FLO-CERT (2008). [http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en FLO-CERT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918131636/http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en |date=2009-09-18 }}. URL accessed on August 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several types of Fairtrade standards, including standards for contract situations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade International|title=Fairtrade standard for Contract Production|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-09-25_CP_EN.pdf|date=September 25, 2012|accessdate=January 23, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510191206/http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-09-25_CP_EN.pdf|archivedate=May 10, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for importers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International|date=April 2, 2012|title=Generic Fairtrade Trade Standard|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf|accessdate=January 15, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502051837/http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf|archivedate=May 2, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also for the different products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our standards|url=https://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/List_of_Fairtrade_Standards.pdf|website=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairtrade standards for small farmers' organizations include requirements for [[democracy|democratic]] decision making, so that farmers may have a say in how the Fairtrade Premiums are invested. They also include requirements for capacity building and economic strengthening of the organization.&lt;ref name="SPO_EN.pdf"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.|date=July 11, 2011|title=Fairtrade Standard for Small Producer Organizations|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-07-11_SPO_EN.pdf|accessdate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairtrade standards for hired labour situations specify that employees receive minimum wages and [[collective bargaining]]. The standards also specify that Fairtrade-certified [[plantation]]s should have no forced or [[child labour]] and that health and safety requirements are met. In a hired labour situation, Fairtrade standards require a "joint body" to be set up with representatives from both the management and the employees. This joint body decides on how Fairtrade Premiums will be spent to benefit [[plantation]] employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade International|date=December 29, 2011|title=Fairtrade standard for Hired Labour|url=
http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2011-12-29-HL_EN.pdf|accessdate=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairtrade standards and procedures are approved by the Fairtrade International Standards Committee, an external committee comprising all FLO stakeholders (labeling initiatives, producers and traders) and external experts. Fairtrade standards are set by FLO in accordance to the requirements of the ISEAL Code of Good Practice in standard setting and are in addition the result of a consultation process, involving a variety of stakeholders: producers, traders, external experts, inspectors, and certification staff.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade International (2006). [http://www.fairtrade.net/standard_setting.html Standard Setting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925031518/http://www.fairtrade.net/standard_setting.html |date=2006-09-25 }}. Accessed October 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fairtrade pricing==

The main aspects of the Fairtrade system are the Minimum Price and the Premium. These are paid to the exporting firm, usually a second tier cooperative, not to the farmer. They are not paid for everything produced by the cooperative members, but for that proportion of their output they are able to sell with the brand 'Fairtrade Certified', typically 17% of their turnover, rising to as much as 60% in a few cases.
* The '''Fairtrade Premium''' is an extra payment over the market price (e.g. an extra 20c/lb for coffee) which is paid to the exporting organization. The residual after extra costs incurred in producing and marketing Fairtrade have been met must be spent on "social projects"  for social and economic development in the producing communities, rather than being given to farmers as extra payment.&lt;ref name="EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SPO_EN.pdf p28"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.|date=July 11, 2011|title=Fairtrade Standard for Small Producer Organizations|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-07-11_SPO_EN.pdf|accessdate=January 3, 2013|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The producers themselves decide how these funds are to be spent. They are generally used for improvements in [[health]], [[education]] or other social facilities, although it may also be used for certain development projects to enable farmers to improve productivity or reduce their reliance on single commodities. Fairtrade producer organizations are required to be able to show what happened to the money, and FLO-CERT should check whether they have such a system in place. 
* The '''Fairtrade Minimum Price''' is a guaranteed price to be paid for a few products like coffee when the world prices collapse. Again, it would usually be spent on "social projects" rather than going to the farmers.

==Fairtrade inspection and certification==

Fairtrade inspection and certification are carried out by [[FLO-CERT]], an independent, for-profit body created by Fairtrade International. FLO-CERT certifies that both producers and traders have met with Fairtrade standards.FLO-CERT inspections and certification follow the international ISO standards for product certification bodies (ISO 65).&lt;ref name="flo-cert.net"&gt;[http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/35.html FLO-CERT Gmbh, (2011) Fee System Small Producer Organization - Explanatory Document. www.flo-cert.net, Retrieved January 3, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

FLO-CERT works with a network of around 100 independent inspectors that regularly visit producer and trade organizations and report back to FLO-CERT. All certification decisions are then taken by a Certification Committee, composed of stakeholders from producers, traders, national labelling organisations and external experts. An Appeals Committee handles all appeals.

In 2006, a ''[[Financial Times]]'' journalist found that ten out of the ten mills they visited had sold uncertified coffee to co-operatives as certified. It reported that they were "also handed evidence of at least one coffee association that received Fairtrade certification despite illegally growing some 20 per cent of its coffee in protected national forest land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weitzman|first1=Hal|title=The bitter cost of ‘fair trade’ coffee|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d191adbc-3f4d-11db-a37c-0000779e2340|accessdate=18 January 2018|work=An emerging criticism of Fairtrade within the industry is that the organisation misleads consumers about its ability to monitor production practices. FLO Cert, a body officially independent of FLO, monitors the certification process.

==Certification costs and returns==

Certified organizations such as cooperatives have to pay FLO-CERT a fee to become certified and a further annual fee for audit and continued certification&lt;ref name="flo-cert.net" /&gt; The first year certification fee per unit sold as "Fairtrade certified"  varies but has been over 6c/lb with an annual fee of 3c/lb to 3.4c/lb for coffee up to 2006 in some countries, at a time when the "Fairtrade premium" was 5c to 10c/lb.&lt;ref&gt;de Janvry, A., McIntosh, C., &amp; Sadoulet, E. (2010). Fair Trade and Free Entry:The Dissipation of Producer Benefits in a Disequilibrium Market. Retrieved December 24, 2012, from http://are.berkeley.edu/~alain/workingpapers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairtrade farmers also have to meet a large range of criteria on production: there are limits on using child labour, pesticides, herbicides, genetically modified products and so on.&lt;ref name="GTS_EN.pdf p11" /&gt;

'''Geobiology''' is a field of [[scientific research]] that explores the interactions between the physical [[Earth]] and the [[biosphere]]. It is a relatively young field, and its borders are fluid. There is considerable overlap with the fields of [[ecology]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[microbiology]], [[paleontology]], and particularly [[biogeochemistry]]. Geobiology applies the principles and methods of biology and geology to the study of the ancient history of the co-evolution of life and Earth as well as the role of life in the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dilek | first = Yildirim  |author2=Harald Furnes |author3=Karlis Muehlenbachs  | title = Links Between Geological Processes, Microbial Activities &amp; Evolution of Life | publisher = Springer | year = 2008 | page = v | url = https://books.google.com/?id=K4pfgYqtR4wC&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=%22Geobiology+is+%22#PPR5,M1 | isbn = 978-1-4020-8305-1}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Geobiologic studies tend to be focused on [[microorganism]]s, and on the role that life plays in altering the chemical and physical environment of the [[lithosphere]], [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[hydrosphere]] and/or [[cryosphere]]. It differs from biogeochemistry in that the focus is on processes and organisms over space and time rather than on global chemical cycles.

Geobiological research synthesizes the [[geologic record]] with modern biologic studies. It deals with process - how organisms affect the Earth and vice versa - as well as history - how the Earth and life have changed together. Much research is grounded in the search for fundamental understanding, but geobiology can also be applied, as in the case of microbes that clean up [[oil spill]]s.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Geobiology employs [[molecular biology]], [[Microbial ecology|environmental microbiology]], [[Chemistry|chemical analyses]], and the geologic record to investigate the evolutionary interconnectedness of life and Earth. It attempts to understand how the Earth has changed since the origin of life and what it might have been like along the way. Some definitions of geobiology even push the boundaries of this time frame - to understanding the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]] and to the role that man has played and will continue to play in shaping the Earth in the [[Anthropocene]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Microbial mat - asessions.jpg|thumb|A microbial mat in White Creek, [[Yellowstone National Park]], USA. Note the conical microstructure of the bacterial communities. These are hypothesized to be a living analogue of ancient fossil [[stromatolite]]s. Each cone has an oxygen gas bubble on top, the product of oxygenic [[photosynthesis]] by [[cyanobacteria]] in the multi-species [[microbial mat]]s.]]
The term geobiology was coined by [[Lourens Baas Becking]] in 1934. In his words, geobiology "is an attempt to describe the relationship between organisms and the Earth," for "the organism is part of the Earth and its lot is interwoven with that of the Earth." Baas Becking's definition of geobiology was born of a desire to unify environmental biology with laboratory biology. The way he practiced it aligns closely with modern environmental [[microbial ecology]], though his definition remains applicable to all of geobiology. In his book, Geobiology, Bass Becking stated that he had no intention of inventing a new field of study.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Baas Becking's Geobiology|last=Becking|first=LGM Baas|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2015|isbn=|editor-last=Canfield|editor-first=Donald E.|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Baas Becking's understanding of geobiology was heavily influenced by his predecessors, including [[Martinus Beijerinck|Martinus Beyerinck]], his teacher from the Dutch School of Microbiology. Others included [[Vladimir Vernadsky]], who argued that life changes the surface environment of Earth in The Biosphere, his 1926 book,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Biosphere|last=Vernadsky|first=Vladimir I.|publisher=|year=1926|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sergei Vinogradsky, famous for discovering lithotrophic bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;Winogradsky, Sergei (1887). "Über Schwefelbakterien". Bot. Zeitung (45): 489–610.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first laboratory officially dedicated to the study of geobiology was the Baas Becking Geobiological Laboratory in Australia, which opened its doors in 1965.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; However, it took another 40 or so years for geobiology to become a firmly rooted scientific discipline, thanks in part to advances in [[geochemistry]] and [[genetics]] that enabled scientists to begin to synthesize the study of life and planet.

In the 1930s, [[Alfred E. Treibs|Alfred Treibs]] discovered [[chlorophyll]]-like [[porphyrin]]s in [[petroleum]], confirming its biological origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Treibs|first=Alfred|date=1936-09-19|title=Chlorophyll- und Häminderivate in organischen Mineralstoffen|journal=Angewandte Chemie|language=en|volume=49|issue=38|pages=682–686|doi=10.1002/ange.19360493803|issn=1521-3757}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby founding organic geochemistry and establishing the notion of [[biomarker]]s,&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;Gaines, S. M. (2008). ''Echoes of Life: What Fossil Molecules Reveal about Earth History: What Fossil Molecules Reveal about Earth History''. Oxford University Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; a critical aspect of geobiology. But several decades passed before the tools were available to begin to search in earnest for chemical marks of life in the rocks. In the 1970s and '80s, scientists like [[Geoffrey Eglinton|Geoffrey Eglington]] and [[Roger Everett Summons|Roger Summons]] began to find lipid biomarkers in the rock record using equipment like [[Gas chromatography|GCMS]].

On the biology side of things, in 1977, [[Carl Woese]] and George Fox published a [[Phylogenetic tree|phylogeny]] of life on Earth, including a new domain - the [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woese|first=Carl R.|last2=Fox|first2=George E.|date=1977-11-01|title=Phylogenetic structure of the prokaryotic domain: The primary kingdoms|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/74/11/5088|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=74|issue=11|pages=5088–5090|doi=10.1073/pnas.74.11.5088|issn=0027-8424|pmid=270744|pmc=432104|bibcode=1977PNAS...74.5088W}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in the 1990s, [[genetics]] and [[genomics]] studies became possible, broadening the scope of investigation of the interaction of life and planet.

Today, geobiology has its own journals, such as [[Geobiology (journal)|''Geobiology'']], established in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Geobiology|journal=Geobiology|doi=10.1111/(issn)1472-4669}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Biogeosciences'', established in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.sciencewatch.com/inter/jou/2010/10decBiogeosci/|title=The Editors of Biogeosciences Discuss the Journal's Success - ScienceWatch.com - Thomson Reuters|last=Reuters|first=Thomson|website=archive.sciencewatch.com|access-date=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as recognition at major scientific conferences.

== Major geobiological events==
[[File:Geobiology timeline with rise of O2.png|thumb|upright=1.35|The geologic timescale overlain with major geobiologic events and occurrences. The oxygenation of the atmosphere is shown in blue starting 2.4 Ga, although the exact dating of the Great Oxygenation Event is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bekker|first=Andrey|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642278334|editor-last=Amils|editor-first=Ricardo|pages=1–9|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-27833-4_1752-4|editor-last2=Gargaud|editor-first2=Muriel|editor-last3=Quintanilla|editor-first3=José Cernicharo|editor-last4=Cleaves|editor-first4=Henderson James|editor-last5=Irvine|editor-first5=William M.|editor-last6=Pinti|editor-first6=Daniele|editor-last7=Viso|editor-first7=Michel|title = Encyclopedia of Astrobiology|chapter = Great Oxygenation Event}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Perhaps the most profound geobiological event is the introduction of [[oxygen]] into the atmosphere by [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[bacteria]]. This [[Great Oxygenation Event|oxygenation]] of [[Earth]]'s primoidial atmosphere (the so-called [[oxygen catastrophe|oxygen catastrophe or Great Oxygenation Event]]) and the oxygenation of the oceans altered surface biogeochemical cycles and the types of organisms that have been evolutionarily selected for.

A subsequent major change was the advent of [[Multicellular organism|multicellularity]]. The presence of oxygen allowed [[eukaryote]]s and, later, multicellular life to evolve.

More anthropocentric geobiologic events include the origin of animals and the establishment of terrestrial plant life, which affected continental erosion and nutrient cycling, and likely changed the types of rivers observed, allowing channelization of what were previously predominantly braided rivers.

More subtle geobiological events include the role of termites in overturning sediments, coral reefs in depositing calcium carbonate and breaking waves, sponges in absorbing dissolved marine silica, the role of dinosaurs in breaching river levees and promoting flooding, and the role of large mammal dung in distributing nutrients.&lt;ref name="Doughty2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Doughty | first1 = C.

== Important concepts ==
Geobiology is founded upon a few core concepts that unite the study of Earth and life. While there are many aspects of studying past and present interactions between life and Earth that are unclear, several important ideas and concepts provide a basis of knowledge in geobiology that serve as a platform for posing researchable questions, including the evolution of life and planet and the co-evolution of the two, genetics - from both a historical and functional standpoint, the metabolic diversity of all life, the sedimentological preservation of past life, and the origin of life.

=== Co-evolution of life and Earth ===
A core concept in geobiology is that life changes over time through [[evolution]]. The theory of evolution postulates that unique populations of organisms or [[species]] arose from genetic modifications in the ancestral population which were passed down by [[Genetic drift|drift]] and [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. (1859). On the origin of species London. ''UK: John Murray''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with standard biological evolution, life and planet co-evolve. Since the best adaptations are those that suit the [[ecological niche]] that the organism lives in, the physical and chemical characteristics of the environment drive the evolution of life by natural selection, but the opposite can also be true: with every advent of evolution, the environment changes.

A classic example of co-evolution is the evolution of [[oxygen]]-producing [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[cyanobacteria]] which oxygenated Earth's [[Archean]] atmosphere.

=== Genes encode geobiological function and history ===
The [[genetic code]] is key to observing the history of [[evolution]] and understanding the capabilities of organisms. [[Gene]]s are the basic unit of [[inheritance]] and function and, as such, they are the basic unit of evolution and the means behind [[metabolism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/basics/gene|title=What is a gene?|last=Reference|first=Genetics Home|website=Genetics Home Reference|access-date=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(2000). ''Molecular evolution and phylogenetics''. Oxford university press.&lt;/ref&gt; It allows us to decipher modern relationships and infer how evolution happened in the past.

Phylogeny can give some sense of history when combined with a little bit more information. Each difference in the DNA indicates divergence between one species and another.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This divergence, whether via drift or natural selection, is representative of some lapse of time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Comparing DNA sequences alone gives a record of the history of evolution with an arbitrary measure of phylogenetic distance “dating” that last common ancestor.

Microbial communities can coordinate in [[Syntrophy|syntrophic]] metabolisms to shift reaction kinetics in their favor. Many organisms can perform multiple metabolisms to achieve the same end goal; these are called [[mixotroph]]s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Biotic metabolism is directly tied to the global cycling of elements and compounds on Earth. The geochemical environment fuels life, which then produces different molecules that go into the external environment. (This is directly relevant to [[biogeochemistry]].) In addition, biochemical reactions are catalyzed by enzymes which sometimes prefer one isotope over others. For example, oxygenic photosynthesis is catalyzed by [[RuBisCO]], which prefers carbon-12 over carbon-13, resulting in carbon isotope fractionation in the rock record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aTradnUUNlwC|title=Stable Isotopes and Plant Carbon-Water Relations|date=2012-12-02|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080918013|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:"Giant" ooids of the Johnnie Formation.jpg|thumb|"Giant" [[ooid]]s of the [[Geology of the Death Valley area|Johnnie Formation]] in the Death Valley area, California, USA. Ooids are near-spheroidal [[calcium carbonate]] grains that accumulate around a central nucleus and can be sedimented to form oolite like this. Microbes can mediate the formation of ooids.&lt;ref name="Grotzinger 313–358"/&gt;]]

=== Sedimentary rocks tell a story ===
[[Sedimentary rock]]s preserve remnants of the history of life on Earth in the form of [[fossil]]s, [[biomarker]]s, [[isotope]]s, and other traces. The rock record is far from perfect, and the preservation of [[biosignature]]s is a rare occurrence. Understanding what factors determine the extent of preservation and the meaning behind what is preserved are important components to detangling the ancient history of the co-evolution of life and Earth.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; The sedimentary record allows scientists to observe changes in life and Earth in composition over time and sometimes even date major transitions, like extinction events.

Some classic examples of geobiology in the sedimentary record include [[stromatolite]]s and banded-iron formations. The role of life in the origin of both of these is a heavily debated topic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Life is fundamentally chemistry ===
The first life arose from [[Abiogenesis|abiotic chemical reactions]]. When this happened, how it happened, and even what planet it happened on are uncertain. However, life follows the rules of and arose from lifeless [[chemistry]] and [[physics]]. It is constrained by principles such as [[thermodynamics]]. This is an important concept in the field because it is represents the epitome of the interconnectedness, if not sameness, of life and Earth.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCollom|first=Thomas M.|date=2013-01-01|title=Miller-Urey and Beyond: What Have We Learned About Prebiotic Organic Synthesis Reactions in the Past 60 Years?|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|volume=41|issue=1|pages=207–229|doi=10.1146/annurev-earth-040610-133457|bibcode=2013AREPS..41..207M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While often delegated to the field of [[astrobiology]], attempts to understand how and when life arose are relevant to geobiology as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scharf|first=Caleb|last2=Virgo|first2=Nathaniel|last3=Cleaves|first3=H. James|last4=Aono|first4=Masashi|last5=Aubert-Kato|first5=Nathanael|last6=Aydinoglu|first6=Arsev|last7=Barahona|first7=Ana|last8=Barge|first8=Laura M.|last9=Benner|first9=Steven A.|date=2015-12-01|title=A Strategy for Origins of Life Research|journal=Astrobiology|volume=15|issue=12|pages=1031–1042|doi=10.1089/ast.2015.1113|issn=1531-1074|pmc=4683543|pmid=26684503|bibcode=2015AsBio..15.1031S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first major strides towards understanding the “how” came with the [[Miller–Urey experiment|Miller-Urey experiment]], when amino acids formed out of a simulated “[[primordial soup]]”. Another theory is that life originated in a system much like the [[hydrothermal vent]]s at [[Seafloor spreading|mid-oceanic spreading centers]]. In the [[Fischer–Tropsch process|Fischer-Tropsch synthesis]], a variety of [[hydrocarbon]]s form under vent-like conditions. Other ideas include the [[RNA world|“RNA World” hypothesis]], which postulates that the first biologic molecule was [[RNA]] and the idea that life originated elsewhere in the [[Solar System|solar system]] and was brought to Earth, perhaps via a [[meteorite]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Methodology ==
[[File:Sunscreen - asessions.jpg|thumb|A [[microbial mat]] growing on acidic soil in [[Norris Geyser Basin|Norris Geyser]] basin, [[Yellowstone National Park]], USA. The black top serves as a sort of sunscreen, and when you look underneath you see the green [[cyanobacteria]].]]
While geobiology is a diverse and varied field, encompassing ideas and techniques from a wide range of disciplines, there are a number of important methods that are key to the study of the interaction of life and Earth that are highlighted here.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
# ''Laboratory [[Microbiological culture|culturing]]'' of microbes is used to characterize the metabolism and lifestyle of organisms of interest.
# ''Gene [[sequencing]]'' allows scientists to study the relationships between extant organisms using phylogenetics. 
# ''Experimental genetic manipulation'' or [[mutagenesis]] is used to determine the function of genes in living organisms.
# ''[[Microscopy]]'' is used to visualize the microbial world. Microscope work ranges from environmental observation to quantitative studies with [[Hybridization probe|DNA probes]] to high-definition visualization of the microbe-mineral interface by [[electron microscope]] (EM).
# ''Isotope tracers'' can be used to track biochemical reactions to understand microbial metabolism.
# ''Isotope natural abundance'' in rocks can be measured to look for [[Isotope fractionation|isotopic fractionation]] that is consistent with biologic origin.
# Detailed ''environmental characterization'' is important to understanding what about a habitat might be driving life’s evolution and, in turn, how life might be changing that niche. It includes and is not limited to, temperature, light, pH, salinity, concentration of specific molecules like oxygen, and the biologic community.
# ''[[Sedimentology]] and [[stratigraphy]]'' are used to read the rocks. The rock record stores a history of geobiologic processes in sediments which can be unearthed through an understanding of [[Deposition (geology)|deposition]], [[sedimentation]], [[Compaction (geology)|compaction]], [[diagenesis]], and [[Deformation (geology)|deformation]].
# The search for and study of fossils, while often delegated to the separate field of ''[[paleontology]]'', is important in geobiology, though the scale of fossils is typically smaller ([[micropaleontology]]).
# The biochemical analysis of ''biomarkers'', which are fossilized or modern molecules that are indicative of the presence of a certain group of organisms or metabolism, is used to answer the evidence for life and metabolic diversity questions.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;
# ''[[Paleomagnetism|Paleomagnetics]]'' is the study of the planet's ancient magnetic field. It is significant to understanding [[magnetofossil]]s, [[biomineralization]], and global ecosystem changes.

== Sub-disciplines and related fields ==
As its name suggests, geobiology is closely related to many other fields of study, and does not have clearly defined boundaries or perfect agreement on what exactly they comprise. Some practitioners take a very broad view of its boundaries, encompassing many older, more established fields such as biogeochemistry, paleontology, and microbial ecology. Others take a more narrow view, assigning it to emerging research that falls between these existing fields, such as with geomicrobiology. The following list includes both those that are clearly a part of geobiology, e.g. geomicrobiology, as well as those that share scientific interests but have not historically been considered a sub-discipline of geobiology, e.g. paleontology.

=== Astrobiology ===
[[Astrobiology]] is an interdisciplinary field that uses a combination of geobiological and [[planetary science]] data to establish a context for the search for life on other [[planet]]s. The origin of life from non-living chemistry and geology, or [[abiogenesis]], is a major topic in astrobiology. Even though it is fundamentally an earth-bound concern, and therefore of great geobiological interest, getting at the origin of life necessitates considering what life requires, what, if anything, is special about Earth, what might have changed to allow life to blossom, what constitutes evidence for life, and even what constitutes life itself. These are the same questions that scientists might ask when searching for alien life. In addition, astrobiologists research the possibility of life based on other metabolisms and elements, the survivability of Earth’s organisms on other planets or spacecrafts, planetary and solar system evolution, and space geochemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://astrobiology.nasa.gov|title=NASA Astrobiology|website=astrobiology.nasa.gov|access-date=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biogeochemistry ===
[[Biogeochemistry]] is a systems science that synthesizes the study of biological, geological, and chemical processes to understand the reactions and composition of the natural environment. It is concerned primarily with global elemental cycles, such as that of nitrogen and carbon. The father of biogeochemistry was [[James Lovelock]], whose “[[Gaia hypothesis]]” proposed that Earth’s biological, chemical, and geologic systems interact to stabilize the conditions on Earth that support life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tYCZh05qBDkC|title=Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth|last=Lovelock|first=James|date=2000-09-28|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191606694|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geobiochemistry ===
[[File:Stromatolites - asessions.jpg|thumb|[[Stromatolite]]s in the Green River Shale, [[Wyoming]], USA, dating to the [[Eocene]]]]Geobiochemistry is similar to [[biogeochemistry]], but differs by placing emphasis on the effects of geology on the development of life’s biochemical processes, as distinct from the role of life on Earth’s cycles. Its primary goal is to link biological changes, encompassing evolutionary modifications of genes and changes in the expression of genes and proteins, to changes in the temperature, pressure, and composition of geochemical processes to understand when and how metabolism evolved. Geobiochemistry is founded on the notion that life is a planetary response because metabolic catalysis enables the release of energy trapped by a cooling planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shock|first=Everett L.|last2=Boyd|first2=Eric S.|date=2015-12-01|title=Principles of Geobiochemistry|url=http://elements.geoscienceworld.org/content/11/6/395|journal=Elements|language=en|volume=11|issue=6|pages=395–401|doi=10.2113/gselements.11.6.395|issn=1811-5209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental microbiology ===
[[Microbiology]] is a broad scientific discipline pertaining to the study of that life which is best viewed under a microscope. It encompasses several fields that are of direct relevance to geobiology, and the tools of microbiology all pertain to geobiology. Environmental microbiology is especially entangled in geobiology since it seeks an understanding of the actual organisms and processes that are relevant in nature, as opposed to the traditional lab-based approach to microbiology. [[Microbial ecology]] is similar, but tend to focus more on lab studies and the relationships between organisms within a community, as well as within the ecosystem of their chemical and geological physical environment. Both rely on techniques such as sample collection from diverse environments, [[metagenomics]], [[DNA sequencing]], and [[statistics]].

=== Geomicrobiology and microbial geochemistry ===
[[File:Microbial mat 2 - asessions.jpg|thumb|A vertical cross section of a [[microbial mat]] containing different [[organism]]s that perform different [[metabolism]]s. The green are presumably [[cyanobacteria]], and teepee-like microstructures are visible on the surface.]][[Geomicrobiology]] traditionally studies the interactions between [[microbe]]s and [[mineral]]s. While it is generally reliant on the tools of microbiology, microbial geochemistry uses geological and chemical methods to approach the same topic from the perspective of the rocks. Geomicrobiology and microbial geochemistry (GMG) is a relatively new interdisciplinary field that more broadly takes on the relationship between microbes, Earth, and environmental systems. Billed as a subset of both geobiology and geochemistry, GMG seeks to understand elemental biogeochemical cycles and the evolution of life on Earth. Specifically, it asks questions about where microbes live, their local and global abundance, their structural and functional biochemistry, how they have evolved, biomineralization, and their preservation potential and presence in the rock record. In many ways, GMG appears to be equivalent to geobiology, but differs in scope: geobiology focuses on the role of all life, while GMG is strictly microbial. Regardless, it is these tiniest creatures that dominated to history of life integrated over time and seem to have had the most far-reaching effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Druschel|first=Gregory K.|last2=Kappler|first2=Andreas|date=2015-12-01|title=Geomicrobiology and Microbial Geochemistry|url=http://elements.geoscienceworld.org/content/11/6/389|journal=Elements|language=en|volume=11|issue=6|pages=389–394|doi=10.2113/gselements.11.6.389|issn=1811-5209|hdl=1805/10102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Molecular geomicrobiology ===
Molecular geomicrobiology takes a mechanistic approach to understanding biological processes that are geologically relevant. It can be at the level of DNA, protein, lipids, or any [[metabolite]].

=== Organic geochemistry ===
[[Organic geochemistry]] is the study of organic molecules that appear in the fossil record in sedimentary rocks. Research in this field concerns molecular fossils that are often lipid biomarkers. Molecules like sterols and hopanoids, membrane lipids found in eukaryotes and bacteria, respectively, can be preserved in the rock record on billion-year timescales. Following the death of the organism they came from and sedimentation, they undergo a process called [[diagenesis]] whereby many of the specific functional groups from the lipids are lost, but the hydrocarbon skeleton remains intact. These fossilized lipids are called steranes and hopanes, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brocks|first=Jochen J.|last2=Logan|first2=Graham A.|last3=Buick|first3=Roger|last4=Summons|first4=Roger E.|date=1999-08-13|title=Archean Molecular Fossils and the Early Rise of Eukaryotes|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/285/5430/1033|journal=Science|language=en|volume=285|issue=5430|pages=1033–1036|doi=10.1126/science.285.5430.1033|issn=0036-8075|pmid=10446042|citeseerx=10.1.1.516.9123}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also other types of molecular fossils, like [[porphyrin]]s, the discovery of which in petroleum by [[Alfred E. Treibs]] actually led to the invention of the field.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; Other aspects of [[geochemistry]] that are also pertinent to geobiology include isotope geochemistry, in which scientists search for isotope fractionation in the rock record, and the chemical analysis of [[Biomineralization|biominerals]], such as [[magnetite]] or microbially-precipitated gold.

=== Paleontology ===
Perhaps the oldest of the bunch, [[paleontology]] is the study of fossils. It involves the discovery, excavation, dating, and paleoecological understanding of any type of fossil, microbial or dinosaur, trace or body fossil. [[Micropaleontology]] is particularly relevant to geobiology. Putative bacterial [[microfossils]] and ancient [[stromatolite]]s are used as evidence for the rise of metabolisms such as oxygenic photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXIVBgAAQBAJ|title=Life on a Young Planet: The First Three Billion Years of Evolution on Earth|last=Knoll|first=Andrew H.|date=2015-03-22|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400866045|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The search for molecular fossils, such as lipid biomarkers like steranes and hopanes, has also played an important role in geobiology and organic geochemistry.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; Relevant sub-disciples include [[paleoecology]] and [[Biogeography|paleobiogeoraphy]].

=== Biogeography ===
[[Biogeography]] is the study of the geographic distribution of life through time. It can look at the present distribution of organisms across continents or between microniches, or the distribution of organisms through time, or in the past, which is called paleobiogeography.

=== Evolutionary biology ===
[[Evolutionary biology]] is the study of the evolutionary processes that have shaped the diversity of life on Earth. It incorporates [[genetics]], ecology, biogeography, and paleontology to analyze topics including [[natural selection]], variance, [[adaptation]], divergence, [[genetic drift]], and [[speciation]].

=== Ecohydrology ===
[[Ecohydrology]] is an interdisciplinary field studying the interactions between water and ecosystems. Stable isotopes of water are sometimes used as tracers of water sources and flow paths between the physical environment and the biosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evaristo|first=Jaivime|last2=Jasechko|first2=Scott|last3=McDonnell|first3=Jeffrey J.|title=Global separation of plant transpiration from groundwater and streamflow|journal=Nature|volume=525|issue=7567|pages=91–94|doi=10.1038/nature14983|pmid=26333467|bibcode=2015Natur.525...91E|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Good|first=Stephen P.|last2=Noone|first2=David|last3=Bowen|first3=Gabriel|date=2015-07-10|title=Hydrologic connectivity constrains partitioning of global terrestrial water fluxes|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6244/175|journal=Science|language=en|volume=349|issue=6244|pages=175–177|doi=10.1126/science.aaa5931|issn=0036-8075|pmid=26160944|bibcode=2015Sci...349..175G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''girlfriend experience''' ('''GFE''') is a commercial experience that blurs the boundaries between a financial transaction and a romantic relationship. It ranges from a [[transactional sex]] relationship&lt;ref name=Hoefinger&gt;{{cite thesis|title=Negotiating Intimacy: Transactional Sex and Relationships Among Cambodian Professional Girlfriends|url=http://research.gold.ac.uk/3419/|last=Hoefinger|first=Heidi|year=2010|type=Doctoral thesis|publisher=Goldsmiths, University of London}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a [[John (prostitution)|client]] paying a prostitute to pretend to be his girlfriend during the session.{{sfn|Flowers|2011|p=151}} Within the [[sex industry]], GFE is a common term for a sexual encounter in which both the [[sex worker]] and the client are willing to engage in reciprocal sexual pleasure and some degree of emotional intimacy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{harvnb|Huff|2011|pp=111–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "girlfriend experience" generally involves more personal interaction than a traditional [[call girl]] or [[escort agency|escort]] offers. There is a focus on not just having sex, but also having more of a comprehensive experience. The details vary widely from person to person.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite magazine|title = The real-life girlfriend experience|magazine = [[GQ]]|author=Anka Radakovich|date =29 March 2012 |url = http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/girls/articles/2010-05/17/gq-girls-anka-radakovich-on-the-girlfriend-escort-experience|accessdate = 19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of [[sex work]], sex workers impart a sense of authenticity in order to make the experience more pleasurable for their customer, as well as to make the outcome more lucrative for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paying for any sexual act, including GFE, is considered to be a form of prostitution regardless of the type of service involved. Because of this the legality of GFE varies from place to place.

If the sex worker is male, the service is called a boyfriend experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weitzer|2007|pp=28–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Girlfriend experience and prostitution == 
Indoor prostitution, which includes the use of [[massage parlor]]s, saunas, [[brothel]]s, [[strip club]]s and [[escort agencies]],&lt;ref name=Farley&gt;{{harvnb|Farley|2005|p=952}}&lt;/ref&gt; is more likely than [[street prostitution]] to involve conversation, affection and mutual sexual pleasure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

A GFE may start with dinner at a restaurant followed by [[making out]] on the sofa in an apartment and end with non-rushed sex and cuddling. In 2012 the cost of a GFE was typically between £200 and £1,200. Escorts traditionally have a reputation for not kissing their clients&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and it used to be the norm for legal prostitutes to never kiss on the mouth.{{sfn|Albert|2011}}{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

Some [[ranch (brothel)|ranch brothels]] in the United States advertise themselves as GFE establishments, including [[Dennis Hof|Dennis Hof's]] [[Dennis Hof's Love Ranch|Love Ranch South]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Menu - Love Ranch Vegas|url=http://www.loveranch.net/menu---love-ranch-vegas.html|website=loveranch.net|accessdate=1 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031213258/http://loveranch.net/menu---love-ranch-vegas.html|archivedate=31 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moonlite BunnyRanch|Moonlite Bunny Ranch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Girlfriend Experience|url=https://www.bunnyranch.com/tag/the-girlfriend-experience/|website=Moonlite Bunny Ranch|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kit Kat Ranch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KitKat Ranch home page|url=http://kitkatranch.com|website=KitKat Ranch website}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sheri's Ranch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sheri's Ranch Sex Menu|url=http://www.sherisranch.com/sex-menu/|website=sherisranch.com|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clients or hobbyists==

The term "client" is sometimes used to describe a person who pays prostitutes for sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cameron|Kulick|2003|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the [[escort agency]] code that has grown up around the GFE, clients often call themselves "hobbyists" and refer to a prostitute who provides GFE as a "nice girl".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a GFE situation the client would pay for time spent with the call girl meaning: social interaction, dating, or sexual acts. Clients could come from all different backgrounds (white-collar, blue collar, different races, different ages) therefore there is not a "typical" type of client using the GFE service. Many clients emerge through the need for a feeling of closeness without the commitment of a relationship. To a certain extent it eliminates the feeling of guilt or fear of "addiction" to a relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Southeast Asia==
Research in Cambodia published in 2010 identified a number of waitresses and bartenders who were also working as "professional girlfriends" with "western boyfriends". They relied on these relationships for their livelihood but did not regard themselves as "prostitutes" and often sought love and marriage as well as material comforts. In these relationships there was a performance of intimacy which lay somewhere between the feigned and the genuine.&lt;ref name=Hoefinger/&gt;

In Thailand some independent sex workers are reported to work as "professional girlfriends", providing company and affection to foreign men and middle-class Thai men, and only having sex with their clients occasionally. Their remuneration is provided in the form of things such as clothing and visits to the cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|last1=Chia|first1=Jasmine|title=Men and their mistresses|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/special-reports/1330319/men-and-their-mistresses|date=24 September 2017|newspaper=Bangkok Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposite sexual functions are performed by different cells of a single mycelium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Homothallic|title=Homothallic|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2018|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be contrasted to [[heterothallic]].

It is often used to categorize [[fungus|fungi]]. In yeast, heterothallic cells have mating types '''a''' and '''α'''. An experienced mother cell (one that has divided at least once) will switch mating type every cell division cycle because of the ''HO'' allele.

Sexual reproduction commonly occurs in two fundamentally different ways in fungi.  These are outcrossing (in heterothallic fungi) in which two different individuals contribute nuclei to form a zygote, and self-fertilization or selfing (in homothallic fungi) in which both nuclei are derived from the same individual.

Among the 250 known species of aspergilli, about 36% have an identified sexual state.&lt;ref name=Dyer&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dyer PS, O'Gorman CM |title=Sexual development and cryptic sexuality in fungi: insights from Aspergillus species |journal=FEMS Microbiol. Rev. |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=165–92 |date=January 2012  |pmid=22091779 |doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2011.00308.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0168-6445&amp;date=2012&amp;volume=36&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among those ''[[Aspergillus]]'' species for which a sexual cycle has been observed, the majority in nature are homothallic (self-fertilizing).&lt;ref name=Dyer /&gt;  Selfing in the homothallic fungus ''[[Aspergillus nidulans]]'' involves activation of the same mating pathways characteristic of sex in outcrossing species, i.e. self-fertilization does not bypass required pathways for outcrossing sex but instead requires activation of these pathways within a single individual.&lt;ref name="pmid17669651"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paoletti M, Seymour FA, Alcocer MJ, Kaur N, Calvo AM, Archer DB, Dyer PS |title=Mating type and the genetic basis of self-fertility in the model fungus Aspergillus nidulans |journal=Curr.

A [[lichen]] is a composite organism consisting of a [[fungus]] and a [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] partner that are growing together in a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship. The photosynthetic partner is usually either a [[Green algae|green alga]] or a [[Cyanobacteria|cyanobacterium]]. Lichens occur in some of the most extreme environments on Earth—[[Tundra#Arctic|arctic tundra]], hot [[desert]]s, rocky coasts, and toxic [[Slag|slag heaps]]. Most lichenized fungi produce abundant sexual structures and in many species sexual spores appear to be the only means of dispersal (Murtagh et al., 2000).  The lichens ''Graphis scripta'' and ''Ochrolechia parella'' do not produce symbiotic vegetative propagules.  Rather the lichen-forming fungi of these species reproduce sexually by self-fertilization (i.e. they are homothallic), and it was proposed that this breeding system allows successful reproduction in harsh environments (Murtagh et al., 2000).&lt;ref name="pmid10766229"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murtagh GJ, Dyer PS, Crittenden PD |title=Sex and the single lichen |journal=Nature |volume=404 |issue=6778 |pages=564 |date=April 2000  |pmid=10766229 |doi=10.1038/35007142 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/35007142}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Homothallism appears to be common in natural populations of fungi. Although self-fertilization employs meiosis, it produces minimal genetic variability. Homothallism is thus a form of sex that is unlikely to be adaptively maintained by a benefit related to producing variability.  However, homothallic meiosis may be maintained in fungi as an adaptation for surviving stressful conditions; a proposed [[Meiosis|benefit of]] [[Meiosis#Theory that DNA repair is the adaptive advantage of meiosis|meiosis]] is the promoted [[Homologous recombination|homologous meiotic recombinational]] repair of DNA damages that are ordinarily caused by a stressful environment.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H and Bernstein C (2013).

'''Hypogeal''', '''hypogean''', '''hypogeic''' and '''hypogeous''' are [[biological]] terms describing an [[organism]]'s activity below the [[soil]] surface.

In [[botany]], a [[seed]] is described as showing '''[[hypogeal germination]]''' when the [[cotyledon]]s of the [[germinate|germinating]] seed remain [[photosynthesis|non-photosynthetic]], inside the seed shell, and below ground.&lt;ref name="BellBryan2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Adrian D. Bell|author2=Alan Bryan|title=Plant Form: An Illustrated Guide to Flowering Plant Morphology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SM3khPHXhKEC&amp;pg=PA200|year=2008|publisher=Timber Press|isbn=978-0-88192-850-1|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The converse, where the cotyledons expand, throw off the seed shell and become [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] above the ground, is '''[[epigeal germination]]'''.

In [[water purification]] works, the '''hypogeal''' (or [[Schmutzdecke]]) layer is a biological film just below the surface of [[slow sand filter]]s. It contains [[microorganism]]s that remove [[bacteria]] and trap contaminant particles.

The terms '''hypogean''' and '''hypogeic''' are used for [[fossorial]] ([[burrow]]ing) and [[Troglobite|troglobitic]] (or [[Stygofauna|stygobitic]]) [[cave]]-living organisms. The opposite terms are [[epigean]] and [[epigeic]].

The term '''hypogeous''' is used for fungi with underground fruiting bodies - for example, [[truffle]]s. The opposite term is [[epigeous]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5609">The '''ischemic (ischaemic) cascade''' is a series of biochemical reactions that are initiated in the [[brain]] and other aerobic tissues after seconds to minutes of [[ischemia]] (inadequate blood supply).&lt;ref name="Becker "&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/EMERG/topic558.htm |title=eMedicine - Stroke, Ischemic : Article by Joseph U Becker |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is typically secondary to [[stroke]], injury, or [[cardiac arrest]] due to [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Most ischemic [[neuron]]s that die do so due to the activation of chemicals produced during and after ischemia.&lt;ref name="Internet Stroke Center"&gt;[http://www.strokecenter.org/ Stroke Center] of the Washington University School of Medicine.&lt;/ref&gt; The ischemic cascade usually goes on for two to three hours but can last for days, even after normal blood flow returns.&lt;ref name="NINDS, 1999"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/stroke/detail_stroke.htm |title=Stroke: Hope Through Research: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[biochemical cascade|cascade]] is a series of events in which one event triggers the next, in a linear fashion. Thus "ischemic cascade" is actually a misnomer, since the events are not always linear: in some cases they are circular, and sometimes one event can cause or be caused by multiple events.&lt;ref name="Hinkle and Bowman, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hinkle JL, Bowman L |title=Neuroprotection for ischemic stroke |journal=J Neurosci Nurs |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=114–8 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12795039 |doi= 10.1097/01376517-200304000-00008|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, cells receiving different amounts of blood may go through different chemical processes. Despite these facts, the ischemic cascade can be generally characterized as follows:

# Lack of oxygen causes the neuron's normal process for making [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] for energy to fail.
# The cell switches to [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|anaerobic metabolism]], producing [[lactic acid]].
# ATP-reliant [[Ion pump (biology)|ion transport pumps]] fail, causing the cell to become [[action potential|depolarized]], allowing [[ion]]s, including [[calcium]] (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), to flow into the [[cell (biology)|cell]]. 
# The ion pumps can no longer transport calcium out of the cell, and intracellular calcium levels get too high. 
# The presence of calcium triggers the release of the excitatory [[amino acid]] [[neurotransmitter]] [[glutamate]]. 
# Glutamate stimulates [[AMPA receptor]]s and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable [[NMDA receptor]]s, which open to allow more calcium into cells. 
# Excess calcium entry overexcites cells and causes the generation of harmful chemicals like [[free radical]]s, [[reactive oxygen species]] and calcium-dependent [[enzyme]]s such as [[calpain]], [[endonuclease]]s, [[ATPase]]s, and [[phospholipase]]s in a process called [[excitotoxicity]].&lt;ref name="conway"&gt;Jill Conway. 2000.

# As the cell's membrane is broken down by phospholipases, it becomes more permeable, and more ions and harmful chemicals flow into the cell. 
# [[mitochondrion|Mitochondria]] break down, releasing toxins and [[apoptosis|apoptotic]] factors into the cell. 
# The [[caspase]]-dependent [[apoptosis]] cascade is initiated, causing cells to "commit suicide."
# If the cell dies through [[necrosis]], it releases glutamate and toxic chemicals into the environment around it. Toxins poison nearby [[neuron]]s, and glutamate can overexcite them. 
# If and when the brain is reperfused, a number of factors lead to [[reperfusion injury]]. 
# An [[inflammation|inflammatory]] response is mounted, and [[phagocytosis|phagocytic]] cells engulf damaged but still viable tissue.  
# Harmful chemicals damage the [[blood–brain barrier]].
# [[Cerebral edema]] (swelling of the brain) occurs due to leakage of large [[molecule]]s like [[albumins]] from blood vessels through the damaged [[blood brain barrier]]. These large molecules pull water into the brain tissue after them by [[osmosis]]. This "[[vasogenic edema]]" causes compression of and damage to brain tissue (Freye 2011; Acquired Mitochondropathy-A New Paradigm in Western Medicine Explaining Chronic Diseases).

==Mitigation of effects==
The fact that the ischemic cascade involves a number of steps has led doctors to suspect that [[Neuroprotection|neuroprotectants]] such as [[calcium channel blocker]]s or [[Glutamate receptor|glutamate]] antagonists could be produced to interrupt the cascade at a single one of the steps, blocking the downstream effects.  Though initial trials for such neuroprotective drugs led many to be hopeful, until recently, human [[clinical trial]]s with neuroprotectants such as [[NMDA receptor antagonist]]s were unsuccessful.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Early life and education==
Bergeron was born in [[New London, Connecticut]] in 1958. She earned a bachelor of arts degree in music from [[Wesleyan University]] and master and doctoral degrees in music from [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://musicologynow.ams-net.org/2013/08/katherine-bergeron-musicologist-named.html|title=Katherine Bergeron, musicologist,&lt;br /&gt; named President of Connecticut College|website=musicologynow.ams-net.org|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theday.com/article/20130820/NWS01/130829981|title=Old Lyme native Katherine Bergeron named president of Conn College|newspaper=The Day|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
As a musician and a historian, Bergeron's scholarship has focused on French music and culture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.conncoll.edu/president-elect/about-president-elect-bergeron/|title=About President-elect Bergeron|website=Connecticut College|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a two-time recipient of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publisher' Deems-Taylor Award for her books ''Decadent Enchantments'' ([[University of California Press]], 1998) and ''Voice Lessons'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2010). ''Voice Lessons'' also received the Otto Kinkeldey Award from the American Musicological Society.

Bergeron has held professorships at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], [[Tufts University]], [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]], and at [[Brown University]], where she also served as dean of the college from 2006 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theday.com/article/20140405/NWS01/140409777|title=Katherine Bergeron inaugurated as Conn College's 11th president|newspaper=The Day|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 20, 2013, the Connecticut College Board of Trustees elected Katherine Bergeron as the 11th president of Connecticut College. Upon announcing her presidency, the chair of the board of trustees stated, “She has a tremendous ability to connect ideas and convert them into action. She is a champion of the tradition of education in the liberal arts and sciences, and, at the same time, an experienced and effective administrator with a record of successful innovation.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.conncoll.edu/president-elect/official-announcement/|title=Official Announcement|website=Connecticut College|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergeron commented, “The notions of modern education and broad access to education are written in the DNA of Connecticut College. This tradition is so important at a time when all institutions of higher education are being asked to create new models for learning and to find new ways to expand access.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.conncoll.edu/president-elect/official-announcement/|title=Official Announcement|website=Connecticut College|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergeron took office on January 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.conncoll.edu/president-elect/about-president-elect-bergeron/|title=About President-elect Bergeron|website=Connecticut College|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.conncoll.edu/president-elect/|title=President-elect|website=Connecticut College|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presidency ==
Since the first year of her presidency, Bergeron has supported the development of a new curriculum at Connecticut College, the first major transformation in 40 years. This venture in integrative education, called Connections, requires all students to make deeper linkages between the work they do in courses, in jobs, and in their lives on campus and in the world, in order to prepare them for leadership in an era of changes: liberal arts for the interconnected world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.conncoll.edu/connections/|title=Connections|website=Connecticut College|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/06/30/connecticut-college-revamps-gen-ed|title=Connecticut College revamps gen ed|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/23/connecticut-college-to-try-new-approach-to-curricu/|title=Connecticut College to try new approach to curriculum|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|newspaper=The Washington Times|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Bergeron's tenure, Connecticut College received the largest gift in its history to support financial aid, career education, and athletics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/mass_roundup/2015/09/mass-ceo-gives-connecticut-school-its-largest.html|title=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/mass_roundup/2015/09/mass-ceo-gives-connecticut-school-its-largest.html|website=www.bizjournals.com|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The College also completed a $10 million renovation of the Charles E. Shain Library that transformed the mid-century facility into a vibrant, modern space for teaching and learning. The library has received several design awards for architectural excellence and historic renovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2016/09/buildings/lbd/charles-e-shain-library-new-landmark-libraries-2016-winner/#_|title=Charles E.

In 2015, Bergeron led a yearlong effort that culminated in a new strategic plan that will move Connecticut College forward into its second distinguished century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.conncoll.edu/strategic-planning/|title=Strategic Planning|website=Connecticut College|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Bergeron is married to Joseph Butch Rovan, a composer and multimedia artist who is professor of music at [[Brown University]] and director of the Brown Arts Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/11/10/workshop-links-entrepreneurs-artists/|title=Workshop links entrepreneurs, artists|last=Rivlin|first=Madison|date=2016-11-10|website=Brown Daily Herald|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kathryn Bridges Harley Clancy''' (also known as '''Kate Clancy''') is an American [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]] who specialises in [[reproductive health]]. She is Associate Professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], in the Department of [[Anthropology]]. Her additional research and policy advocacy work focuses on [[sexual harassment]] in [[science]] and [[Academy|academia]].

== Fertility research ==
Clancy's [[fertility]] research focuses on menstruation and variability in [[Endometrium|endometrial]] function. Clancy's early published research demonstrated that, contrary to previous belief, menstruation does not increase risk for iron-deficiency anemia. Instead, Clancy and colleagues show that a thicker endometrium is associated with greater iron reserves amongst healthy women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B. H.|last2=Nenko|first2=Ilona|last3=Jasienska|first3=Grazyna|date=September 2006|title=Menstruation does not cause anemia: endometrial thickness correlates positively with erythrocyte count and hemoglobin concentration in premenopausal women|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|volume=18|issue=5|pages=710–713|doi=10.1002/ajhb.20538|issn=1042-0533|pmid=16917885}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clancy's later studies focus on rural Polish populations. Clancy explores potential variation amongst endometrial function, or the functions of the inner mucous membrane layer of the [[uterus]]. Her research finds that endometrial thickness is negatively correlated over the latter phase of the menstrual cycle (the [[luteal phase]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B.H.|date=2007-09-01|title=Unexpected luteal endometrial decline in a healthy rural Polish population|url=http://www.ejog.org/article/S0301-2115(06)00461-1/fulltext|journal=European Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology and Reproductive Biology|language=English|volume=134|issue=1|pages=133–134|doi=10.1016/j.ejogrb.2006.07.041|issn=0301-2115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clancy's research contributes to understandings of fertility variation amongst normal, premenopausal Western women. For example, Swedish women appear to show an increase in endometrial thickness in the early part of the luteal phase, while for Canadian and English women, patterns appear largely stable at similar times. Canadian and Swedish women's endometrial thickness drops at other times, and while for Scottish sample, there is an increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CLANCY|first=KATHRYN B.H.|last2=ELLISON|first2=PETER T.|last3=JASIENSKA|first3=GRAZYNA|last4=BRIBIESCAS|first4=RICHARD G.|date=2009|title=Endometrial thickness is not independent of luteal phase day in a rural Polish population|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ase/117/3/117_090130/_html|journal=Anthropological Science|language=en|volume=117|issue=3|pages=157–163|doi=10.1537/ase.090130|issn=0918-7960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clancy and colleagues' research suggests that endometrial thickness should be measured daily to better capture and study this variation.

Clancy has also made a broader contribution to the study of human evolutionary biology and ecological stress on ovaries and endometrial function. She finds that immune stress and psychosocial stress impacts on the endometrium's ability to carry a fetus through the mechanism of inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B.H.|date=2009-01-01|title=Reproductive ecology and the endometrium: Physiology, variation, and new directions|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.21188/abstract|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=en|volume=140|issue=S49|pages=137–154|doi=10.1002/ajpa.21188|issn=1096-8644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clancy's later research focuses on primate development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781461440598|title=Building Babies - Primate Development in Proximate and {{!}} Kathryn B.H. Clancy {{!}} Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also dispelled the myth that women's menstrual cycles can become synchronised due to their close social bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/context-and-variation/menstrual-synchrony/|title=Do Women in Groups Bleed Together?

== Sexual harassment research ==
Clancy is part of a team of [[anthropologist]]s who led the '''Survey of Academic Field Experiences''' study,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B. H.|last2=Nelson|first2=Robin G.|last3=Rutherford|first3=Julienne N.|last4=Hinde|first4=Katie|date=2014-07-16|title=Survey of Academic Field Experiences (SAFE): Trainees Report Harassment and Assault|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0102172|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=9|issue=7|pages=e102172|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0102172|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as [[SAFE13 Study|SAFE13]]. The study, co-authored with Robin G. Nelson, Julienne N. Rutherford and Katie Hinde, analysed experiences of sexual harassment and [[sexual assault]] in scientific fieldwork sites. The study found the majority of researchers had been exposed to, or experienced, sexual harassment, especially women and junior scientists.

A follow-up study (known as "'''SAFE 2'''"), led by Nelson, Rutherford, Hinde and Clancy identified systemic patterns that lead to negative fieldwork experiences and harassment. Field sites that have clear codes of conduct and consequences for behaviour are less likely to lead to sexual harassment. Where problems arise, these sites deal with issues swiftly and consistently, leading to higher levels of perceived safety and equality. In fieldwork sites where clear rules and consequences do not exist or are ambiguous, leaders do not take action against harassment. This leads to ongoing alienation and professional retaliation.

The SAFE13 study and subsequent research and activities (media interviews, conferences and advocacy) have made significant impact on increasing awareness of institutional responses to sexual harassment, as well as policy reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marieclaire.com/career-advice/a14104684/sexual-harassment-assault-in-science-field/|title="It Gnaws Away at Me": Female Scientists Report a Horrifying Culture of Sexual Assault|date=2017-12-11|work=Marie Claire|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February 2018, Clancy, provided testimony to the Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing on sexual harassment in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/subcommittee-research-and-technology-hearing-review-sexual-harassment-and|title=Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing - A Review of Sexual Harassment and Misconduct in Science|date=2018-02-27|work=Committee on Science, Space, and Technology|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clancy testified that creating a safe, harassment-free workplace culture was imperative to improving science.

=== Racism and gender harassment ===
In 2017, Clancy led another study on sexual harassment in collaboration with Katharine M. N. Lee, Erica M. Rodgers and Christina Richey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B. H.|last2=Lee|first2=Katharine M. N.|last3=Rodgers|first3=Erica M.|last4=Richey|first4=Christina|date=2017-07-01|title=Double jeopardy in astronomy and planetary science: Women of color face greater risks of gendered and racial harassment|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JE005256/abstract|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets|language=en|volume=122|issue=7|pages=2017JE005256|doi=10.1002/2017JE005256|issn=2169-9100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research involved an online survey of 474 astronomers and planetary scientists. It is the first study of its kind in the physical sciences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lallensack|first=Rachael|date=2017-07-20|title=Female astronomers of colour face daunting discrimination|url=https://www.nature.com/news/female-astronomers-of-colour-face-daunting-discrimination-1.22291|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=547|issue=7663|pages=266–267|doi=10.1038/nature.2017.22291}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is the first large study to examine both gender and racial harassment in academic science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/07/its-2017-and-women-of-colour-in-science-are-still-being-harassed/|title=It's 2017, And Women Of Colour In Science Are Still Being Harassed|date=2017-07-11|work=Gizmodo Australia|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study finds that 88% of participants had heard negative language at work, along with other verbal and physical abuse that made them feel unsafe. Women of colour, however, experienced the greatest level of hostility due to their race and gender. They experienced greater incidents of gendered and racialised harassment and were more attuned to noticing other forms of harassment such as homophobia. Forty percent of women of colour feel unsafe at work due to their gender or sex, and 28% due to their race. Women of colour are also more likely to skip educational and professional opportunities, such as meetings and conferences, in an attempt to minimise exposure to hostility and harassment.

The study received wide media coverage, as it provided evidence on how harassment limits women's career outcomes, especially for racial minority women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/07/11/women-of-color-face-staggering-harassment-in-space-science/|title=Women of color face staggering harassment in space science|last=Kaplan|first=Sarah|date=2017-07-11|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clancy also noted that the study unearths how survivors are re-traumatised by existing reporting systems that have no intermediary level of support in between staying silent and launching a formal report.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study has been commended for showing how racial discrimination compounds experiences of sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/07/14/women-color-stem-face-greater-risks-gender-racial-harassment-work/467501001/|title=Women of color in STEM face greater risks of gender, racial harassment at work|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also shows that the impact of harassment contributes to a higher loss of women of colour in science relative to White women scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/azeenghorayshi/unsafe-science|title=Many Women Of Color Feel Unsafe Working In Science, New Study Finds|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study raises questions about [[Bystander effect|bystander interventions]], given the hostile culture towards women of colour is evident to witnesses, who do not feel empowered to act.

Clancy served on the [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's]] 2018 consensus report entitled "Sexual Harassment of Women: Climate, Culture, and Consequences in Academic Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-08-01|title=Sexual Harassment of Women|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24994/sexual-harassment-of-women-climate-culture-and-consequences-in-academic|language=en|doi=10.17226/24994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In 2006, Clancy worked as a lecturer at [[Yale University]]. One year later, she joined [[Harvard University]] as Preceptor Faculty and Associate at the Department of Anthropology. She has worked at the University of Illinois since 2008, where she started as a lecturer and now works as an Associate Professor in Anthropology.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://anthro.illinois.edu/directory/profile/kclancy|title=Kathryn B.

She is also Co-Director of the Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lee-anthro.blogspot.com.au/p/people.html|title=Laboratory for Evolutionary Endocrinology: People|website=Laboratory for Evolutionary Endocrinology|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since September 2016, Clancy has hosted the Period Podcast, where she discusses issues regarding the science of menstrual cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kateclancy.com/the-return-of-period-podcast/|title=The return of PERIOD Podcast! {{!}} Context &amp; Variation|website=kateclancy.com|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theme is connected to her early research.

== Education ==
Clancy graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree [[Latin honors|cum laude]] from Harvard University in 2001, specialising in [[Biological anthropology|Biological Anthropology]] and [[Women's studies|Women's Studies]]. She obtained her PhD in Anthropology from Yale University in 2007.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Alabama ===
In 1985, [[University of Alabama]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]] began to offer a master's degree in the book arts&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookarts.ua.edu/ University of Alabama book arts program]&lt;/ref&gt; in the School of Library and Informational Studies. It emphasizes making books by hand.

[[Edith Frohock]] taught book arts at [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]]. Frohock specialized in painting, printmaking and artist's books and was the first instructor to teach books as art in the South. [[Mary Ann Sampson]] credits Frohock for steering her in the direction of book arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uab.edu/art/PDFs/scholarships/UAB_Art_Frohock_Scholar.pdf scholarship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230202400/http://www.uab.edu/art/PDFs/scholarships/UAB_Art_Frohock_Scholar.pdf |date=2006-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Space One Eleven in Birmingham, Alabama is a not-for-profit under the direction of [[Anne Arrasmith]] and Peter Prinz. The organization has exhibited books as art on numerous occasions including the work of [[Larry Gens Anderson]], [[Pinky Bass]], [[Jon Coffelt]], [[Edith Frohock]], [[Ann Howard (author)|Anne Howard]], [[Joni Mabe]], [[Mary Ann Sampson]], [[David Sandlin]], [[Joel Seah]] and [[Marie Weaver]] among many others who have worked in book arts.

[[Agnes (gallery)|Agnes]] 1992–2001 was the first commercial gallery to show book arts in the South and one of only a handful in the country. During its eight years, the gallery, owned by Shawn Boley, [[Jon Coffelt]] and Janet Hughes exhibited the work of many noteworthy book artists including Sara Garden Armstrong, [[Pinky Bass]], Mare Blocker, Elisa Bryan, Denise Carbone, Al Edwards, [http://www.susanhenseldesign.com/artbooks.html Susan Hensel], [[Jenny Holzer]], Davi Det Hompson, [[Lee Isaacs]], Sally Johnson, Susan E. King, Jim Koss, Ruth Laxson, Miranda Maher, Emily Martin, Vicki Ragan, Tut Altman Riddick, Anita Ronderos, Jessica Rosner, [[Ed Ruscha]], David Sandlin, Claire Jeanine Satin and Joel Seah.

OEO Press founded by [[Mary Ann Sampson]]. After studying bookmaking at [[UAB]] with [[Edith Frohock]], Sampson says she was steering into a career in artist's books. Her press is located in [[Ragland, Alabama]] and continues to produce limited edition fine art books.

=== California ===
The CODEX Foundation, founded in 2005 and located in Berkeley, holds The CODEX International Symposium and Artists' Book Fair every two years in early February, on the odd year.  It is the largest artists' book fair in the world with over 300 artists coming from more than 26 countries. The Codex Foundation exists to preserve and promote the contemporary hand-made book as a work of art in the broadest possible context and to bring to public recognition the artists, the craftsmanship, and the rich history of the civilization of the book. Their mission also carries with it a deep obligation to publish in an affordable format essays, manifestos, and theoretical writings that serve to promote and contextualize the work of contemporary artists of the book. The editorial strategy is to publish exemplary materials that showcase the state of the art of the book worldwide, and to provide a broader public platform for the artists, writers, and printers whose art, craft, and livelihoods depend largely on a healthy commercial environment for their work. To support its mission they have published Book Art Object Vol.s 1 &amp; 2 devoted to the exhibitors and symposia proceedings of CODEX events, both volumes are considered as valuable books of reference for the field, 14 Code(X)+1 monographs devoted to critical theory, and Alchimie du Verbe and Mapping the Artist’s Cosmos box set Assembly-Exchanges, original prints from 52 renowned book artists and printers.

The [[San Francisco Center for the Book]] was founded by Mary Austin and Kathleen Burch in 1996 and was the first Center of its kind on the West Coast. SFCB maintains a 6,358 square foot facility that houses a large print studio, book bindery, and classroom and administrative space. SFCB offers four to five book arts-related exhibitions each year, focused on artist's books, design bindings, fine press books, artist retrospectives, and private collections among other topics. Its workshop program presents 325 letterpress printing, bookbinding, and related arts workshops to nearly 2,000 students annually. SFCB is also home to the annual Roadworks Steamroller Printing Festival, a local artist/vendor street festival that celebrates printing by using the road surface as a printing bed and antique steamrollers as presses for large-scale linocut prints. Attendance at this street festival tops 3,000.

The [[Los Angeles]] art scene (see: [[:Category:Art in the Greater Los Angeles Area|Art in the Greater Los Angeles Area]]) is considered one of the founding homes of the artist's book. "Twenty-Six Gasoline Stations", created by [[Ed Ruscha]] in 1964 is one of the first artist's books. The [[Athenaeum Music &amp; Arts Library]] in [[La Jolla, California|La Jolla]] has a large collection of artists' books, focusing on conceptual artists' books, and those created by California artists and presses. The library holds the complete collection of Ruscha's conceptual artist's books created during the 1960s and 70s.

The Women's Graphic Center, at the [[Woman's Building]], was founded in 1973, for women artists to create artist's books. Exhibitions were held there. The center closed in 1991. The Lab Press was founded in the 1970s by Woman's Building co-founder [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]] to teach printing and the making of books.

The [[Otis College of Art and Design]] began collecting and exhibiting artists' books in the 1960s.

Mills College in Oakland offers undergraduate as well as graduate degrees in Book Arts. Mills College offers a unique MFA in Book Art and Creative Writing Program, the first such program in the country, which is designed to help develop the student as both a writer and a visual artist, to enhance the understanding of contemporary writing and its visual forms, and to encourage a deep exploration of the book as both a literary artifact and a material object that exists in space and time.

=== Florida ===
[[Florida Atlantic University]]'s Wimberly Library is home to the [http://www.library.fau.edu/depts/spc/jaffe.htm Jaffe Center for Book Arts] which revolves around a collection of books as aesthetic objects focused on artists' books and limited editions. In 1998, Arthur and Mata Jaffe donated their collection of 2,800 books to FAU and the Jaffe Collection opened in 2000. Since then, the collection has grown to over 6,000 cataloged materials, as well as thousands more yet to be cataloged. In 2007, an expanded Jaffe Center for Book Arts opened; it included a letterpress studio, book bindery and paper making lab. In 2011, poet and artist Helen M. Salzberg established JCBA's Artist in Residence (AIR) program which funds two residencies each academic year. The AIRs produce creative works utilizing JCBA facilities. They also teach workshops and provide mentoring opportunities to FAU students and staff. JCBA is based at a university, but the center's programming is community-based: JCBA offers workshops and presents educational book arts programming (as well as intimate concerts, films and other book art related events) for the students and faculty of FAU as well as the broader community.

The [[University of Florida]] in Gainesville, FL has a small collection of [http://web.uflib.ufl.edu/spec/rarebook/links.htm book arts] in the [[Harold and Mary Jean Hanson Rare Book Collection]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Subject Guide to the Harold and Mary Jean Hanson Rare Book Collection |url=http://web.uflib.ufl.edu/spec/rarebook/links.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; including engraving proofs from [[William Morris]], engraved wood blocks by [[Eric Gill]], and letterpress books by [[Julie Chen (book artist)]]. In addition, undergraduate and graduate courses in book arts and letterpress are offered in the [[University of Florida College of the Arts]].

=== Georgia ===
Nexus Press, in Atlanta, was a major publisher of artists books. Founded in 1978 by Michael Goodman and Gary Lee Super, Nexus Press encouraged artists to make books as original works of art. Nexus Press was one of the few artists book publishing centers that provided artists with access to offset lithography as a creative process. Though the press also had letterpress equipment, it never was a center for fine print production. It was a center for experimental book production and produced more than 150 titles, including I Want to Take Picture, by Bill Burke. The Atlanta Contemporary Art Center suspended all Nexus Press operations in 2003.

The Virginia Arts of the Book Center was founded in 1995 in Charlottesville as a public-access book arts workshop providing cooperative use of presses and type for letterpress printing. Begun by Josef Beery, Cal Otto, and Terry Belanger, the Center became the locus of serious artistic activity during the years preceding and following the turn of the millennium when book artist, art theoretician, and author Johanna Drucker became its visiting artist for almost a decade. Partnership with the University of Virginia Art Department through the sponsorship of art professor and book artist Dean Dass opened the center to the activities of college students from surrounding academic institutions. Through the leadership of Kevin McFadden, the self-governed organization was absorbed by the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities during this period and then in 2018 became a part of the Virginia Center for the Book. The current resident artist and program director is Garrett Queen who provides support to a vibrant group of book artists who teach classes and sponsor events encouraging and supporting the arts of the book. They describe themselves as "a community of artists exploring books, paper, and printmaking."

A '''lunar standstill''' is the gradually varying range between the northern and the southern limits of the Moon's [[declination]], or the '''lunistices''', over the course of one-half a [[Lunar month#Sidereal month|sidereal month]] (about two [[week]]s), or 13.66 days. (Declination is a [[equatorial coordinate system|celestial coordinate]] measured as the angle from the [[celestial equator]], analogous to [[latitude]].) One major, or one minor, lunar standstill occurs every 18.6 years due to the [[Lunar precession#Nodal precession|precessional cycle]] of the [[lunar node]]s at that rate.

At a major lunar standstill, the Moon's range of declination, and consequently its range of [[azimuth]] at moonrise and moonset, reaches a maximum. As a result, viewed from the [[middle latitudes]], the Moon's [[horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] at upper [[culmination]] (the daily moment when the object appears to contact the observer's [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]) changes in just two weeks &amp;ndash; from highest to lowest above the [[horizon]] due north or south, depending on the observer's [[hemispheres of Earth|hemisphere]]. Similarly, its azimuth at moonrise changes from northeast to southeast and at moonset from northwest to southwest.

This time appears to have had special significance for the [[Bronze Age]] societies, who built the [[megalithic monument]]s in [[prehistoric Britain|Britain]] and [[Prehistoric Ireland|Ireland]]. It also has significance for some [[neopagan]] religions. Evidence also exists that alignments to the moonrise or moonset on the days of lunar standstills can be found in ancient sites of other ancient cultures, such as at [[Chimney Rock National Monument|Chimney Rock]] in [[Colorado]] and [[List of Hopewell sites|Hopewell Sites]] in [[Ohio]].

==Origin of name==
The term ''lunar standstill'' was apparently first used by archeologist [[Alexander Thom]] in his 1971 book ''Megalithic Lunar Observatories''.&lt;ref name=vincent3&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vincent|first=Fiona|title=A major ‘lunar standstill’|journal=Journal of the British Astronomical Association|date=2005|volume=115|issue=4|pages=220|url=http://www.britastro.org/jbaa/pdf/115-4forum.pdf|accessdate=14 January 2012|bibcode=2005JBAA..115..220V}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[solstice]]'', which derives from the Latin ''solstitium'': ''sol''- (sun) + -''stitium'' (a stoppage), describes the similar extremes in the Sun's varying declination. Neither the Sun nor the Moon stands still, obviously; what stops, momentarily, is the change in declination. The word ''[[wiktionary:tropic|tropic]]'', as in [[Tropic of Capricorn]], comes from ancient Greek meaning "to turn", referring to how ascending (or descending) motion turns to descending (or ascending) motion at the solstice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tropic?s=t Dictionary.com – tropic]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informal explanation==
[[File:Lunar standstill.GIF|thumb]]
{{see|Equatorial coordinate system}}

As [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotates]] on its axis, the stars in the [[night sky]] appear to follow [[star trail|circular paths]] around the [[celestial pole]]s. (This daily cycle of apparent movement is called [[diurnal motion]].) All the stars seem [[fixed stars|fixed]] on a [[celestial sphere]] surrounding the observer. In the same way that [[spherical coordinate system|positions]] on Earth are measured using [[latitude]] and [[longitude]], the [[apparent place]]s of stars on this sphere are measured in [[right ascension]] (equivalent to longitude) and [[declination]] (equivalent to latitude). If viewed from a latitude of [[50th parallel north|50° N]] on Earth, any star with a declination of +50° would pass directly overhead (reaching the [[zenith]] at upper [[culmination]]) once every [[sidereal time|sidereal day]] (23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds), whether visible at [[night]] or obscured in [[daylight]].

Unlike the stars, the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] do not have a fixed declination. Since Earth's rotational [[axial tilt|axis is tilted]] about 23.5° with respect to a line perpendicular to its [[orbital plane]] (the [[ecliptic]]), the Sun's declination ranges from +23.5° on the [[June solstice]] to −23.5° on the [[December solstice]], as [[Earth's orbit|Earth orbits]] the Sun once every [[tropical year]]. Therefore in June, in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the [[noon|midday]] Sun is higher in the sky, and [[daytime]] then is longer than in December. In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], the situation is reversed. This obliquity causes Earth's [[season]]s.

The Moon's declination also changes, completing a cycle once every lunar [[nodal period]]: 27.212 days. Thus, lunar declination ranges from a positive value to a negative one in just under [[fortnight|two weeks]], and back. Consequently in under a month, the Moon's [[altitude (astronomy)|altitude]] at upper [[culmination]] (when it contacts the observer's [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]) can shift from higher in the sky to lower above the horizon, and back.

The Moon differs from most [[natural satellite]]s around other planets in that it remains near the [[ecliptic]] (the plane of [[Earth's orbit]] around the Sun) instead of Earth's [[celestial equator|equatorial plane]]. The Moon's maximum and minimum declination vary because the [[orbital plane|plane]] of the [[orbit of the Moon|Moon's orbit]] around Earth is inclined about 5.14° with respect to the ecliptic plane, and the spatial direction of the Moon's [[orbital inclination]] gradually changes over an 18.6-year cycle, alternately adding to or subtracting from the 23.5° tilt of Earth's axis.

Therefore, the maximum declination of the Moon varies roughly from (23.5° − 5° =) 18.5° to (23.5° + 5° =) 28.5°. At the minor lunar standstill, the Moon will change its declination during the nodal period from +18.5° to −18.5°, for a total range of 37°. Then 9.3 years later, during the major lunar standstill, the Moon will change its declination during the nodal period from +28.5° to −28.5°, which totals 57° in range. This range is enough to bring the Moon's altitude at [[culmination]] from high in the sky to low above the horizon in just two weeks (half an orbit).

Strictly speaking, the lunar standstill is a moving position in space relative to the direction of Earth's axis and to [[nodal precession|the rotation]] of the Moon's [[orbital node]]s ([[lunar node|lunar nodal]] [[lunar prescession|precession]]) once every 18.6 years. The standstill position does not persist over the two weeks that the Moon takes to move from its maximum (positive) declination to its minimum (negative) declination, and it most likely will not exactly coincide with either extreme.

However, because the 18.6-year cycle of standstills is so much longer than the Moon's [[Lunar month#Sidereal month|orbital period]] (about 27.3 days) that the change in the declination range over periods as short as half an orbit is very small. The period of the lunar nodes precessing in space is slightly shorter than the lunar standstill interval due to Earth's [[axial precession]], altering Earth's axial tilt over a very long period relative to the direction of lunar nodal precession. Simply, the standstill cycle results from the combination of the two inclinations.

==Apparent position of the Moon during standstill==
The [[azimuth]] (horizontal direction) of moonrise and moonset varies according to the Moon's [[nodal period]] of 27.212 days, while the azimuth variation during each nodal period varies with the lunar standstill period (18.613 years).

For a latitude of [[55th parallel north|55° north]] on Earth, the following table shows moonrise and moonset azimuths for the Moon's narrowest and widest arc paths across the sky. The azimuths are given in degrees from [[true north]] and apply when the horizon is unobstructed. Figures for a time midway between major and minor standstill are also given.

The arc path of the [[full moon|full Moon]] generally reaches its widest in midwinter and its narrowest in midsummer. The widest arc path of the [[new moon|new Moon]] (when it near the Sun in the sky) is in the summer, as for the Sun.&lt;ref name=burl&gt;{{cite book |last=Burl |first=Aubrey |title=A Guide to the Stone Circles of Britain, Ireland and Brittany |date=1995 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |isbn=9780300063318 |pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For observers at the [[middle latitudes]] (not too near the [[Equator]] or either [[geographical pole|pole]]), the Moon is highest in the sky in each period of 24 hours when it reaches the observer's [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]. During the month, these [[culmination]] altitudes vary so as to produce a greatest value and a least value. The following table shows these altitudes at different times in the lunar nodal period for an observer at 55° north. The greatest and least culminations occur about two weeks apart.

==Detailed explanation==
[[File:lunar orbit.png|thumb|300px|Apparent paths of the Sun and Moon on the [[celestial sphere]] (angles exaggerated for clarity)]]

A more detailed explanation is best considered in terms of the paths of the Sun and Moon on the [[celestial sphere]], as shown in the first diagram. This shows the abstract sphere surrounding the Earth at the center. The Earth is oriented so that its axis is vertical.

The Sun is, by definition, always seen on the [[ecliptic]] (the Sun's apparent path across the sky) while Earth is tilted at an angle of ''e''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;23.5° to the plane of that path and completes one orbit around the Sun in 365.25636 days, slightly longer than one year due to precession altering the direction of Earth's inclination.

The Moon's orbit around Earth (shown dotted) is inclined at an angle of ''i'' = 5.14° relative to the ecliptic. The Moon completes one orbit around the Earth in 27.32166 days. The two points at which Moon crosses the ecliptic are known as its [[orbital node]]s, shown as "N1" and "N2" (ascending node and descending node, respectively), and the line connecting them is known as the ''line of nodes''. Due to [[apsidal precession|precession]] of the Moon's [[orbital inclination]], these crossing points, the nodes and the positions of eclipses, gradually shift around the ecliptic in a period of 18.59992 years.

Looking at the diagram, note that when the Moon's line of nodes (N1 &amp; N2) rotates a little more than shown, and aligns with Earth's equator, (from front to back, N1, Earth, and N2, seem to be the same dot), the Moon's orbit will reach its steepest angle with the Earth's equator, and in 9.3 years (from front to back, N2, Earth, N1 seem to be the same dot) it will be the shallowest: the 5.14° declination (tilt) of the Moon's orbit either adds to (major standstill) or subtracts from (minor standstill) the inclination of earth's rotation axis (23.439°).

[[File:LunarDec2006.png|thumb|300px|The declination of the Moon in 2005–06]]

The effect of this on the declination of the Moon is shown in the second diagram. During the course of the nodal period, as the Moon orbits the Earth, its declination swings from –''m''° to +''m''°, where ''m'' is a number in the range (''e''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;''i'')&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;(''e''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''i''). At a minor standstill (e.g., in 2015), its declination during the month varies from –(''e''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;''i'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;–18.5° to +(''e''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;''i'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;18.5°. During a major standstill (e.g., in 2005-2006), the declination of the Moon varied during each month from about –(''e''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''i'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;–28.5° to +(''e''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''i'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;28.5°.

[[File:LunarMaxima2006.png|thumb|300px|The maximum declinations of the Moon in 2005–06]]

However, an additional subtlety further complicates the picture. The Sun's gravitational attraction on the Moon pulls it toward the plane of the ecliptic, causing a slight wobble of about 9 arcmin within a 6-month period. In 2006, the effect of this was that, although the 18.6-year maximum occurred in June, the maximum declination of the Moon was not in June but in September, as shown in the third diagram.

==Other complications==
Because the Moon is relatively close to the Earth, [[lunar parallax]] alters declination up to 0.95° when observed from Earth's surface versus geocentric declination, the declination of the Moon from the center of the Earth. Geocentric declination may be up to about 0.95° different from the observed declination. The amount of this parallax varies with latitude, hence the observed maximum of each standstill cycle varies according to position of observation.

[[Atmospheric refraction]] – the bending of the light from the Moon as it passes through the Earth's atmosphere – alters the observed declination of the Moon, more so at low elevation, where the atmosphere is thicker (deeper).

Not all the maxima are observable from all places in the world – the Moon may be below the horizon at a particular observing site during the maximum, and by the time it rises, it may have a lower declination than an observable maximum at some other date.

Note that all dates and times in this section, and in the table, are in [[UTC]], all celestial positions are in topocentric apparent coordinates, including the effects of parallax and refraction, and the lunar phase is shown as the fraction of the Moon's disc which is illuminated.

In 2006, the ''minimum'' lunar declination, as seen from the centre of the Earth, was at 16:54 UTC on 22 March, when the Moon reached an apparent declination of −28:43:23.3. The next two best contenders were 20:33 on 29 September, at a declination of −28:42:38.3 and 13:12 on 2 September at declination −28:42:16.0.

The ''maximum'' lunar declination, as seen from the centre of the Earth, was at 01:26 on 15 September, when the declination reached +28:43:21.6. The next highest was at 07:36 on 4 April, when it reaches +28:42:53.9

However, these dates and times do not represent the maxima and minima for observers on the Earth's surface.

For example, after taking refraction and parallax into account, the observed maximum on 15 September in Sydney, Australia was several hours earlier, and then occurred in daylight. The table on the right shows the major standstills that were actually visible (i.e. not in full daylight, and with the Moon above the horizon) from both London, UK, or Sydney, Australia.

For other places on the Earth's surface, positions of the Moon can be calculated using the [http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi JPL ephemeris calculator].

==Municipal corporation as local self-government==
Municipal incorporation occurs when such [[municipality|municipalities]] become self-governing entities under the laws of the state or province in which they are located. Often, this event is marked by the award or declaration of a [[municipal charter]]. A '''city charter''' or '''town charter''' or '''municipal charter''') is a legal [[document]] establishing a [[municipality]] such as a [[city]] or [[town]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===United States===
{{main|Local government in the United States}}
In the United States, such municipal corporations are established by charters that are granted either directly by a [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] by means of [[local legislation]], or indirectly under a general municipal corporation [[law]], usually after the proposed [[charter]] has passed a referendum vote of the affected population.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

[[File:1600 Himmelsscheibe von Nebra sky disk anagoria.jpg|thumb|Another photograph, at the [[Pergamon Museum]] ]]

The '''Nebra sky disk''' is a [[bronze]] disk of around {{convert|30|cm|in|sp=us}} diameter and a weight of {{convert|2.2|kg|lb}}, with a blue-green [[patina]] and inlaid with gold symbols. These are interpreted generally as a sun or full moon, a lunar crescent, and stars (including a cluster interpreted as the [[Pleiades]]). Two golden arcs along the sides, marking the angle between the [[solstice]]s, were added later. A final addition was another arc at the bottom surrounded with multiple strokes (of uncertain meaning, variously interpreted as a [[Solar Deity#Solar barge and sun chariot|Solar Barge]] with numerous oars, as the [[Milky Way]], or as a [[rainbow]]).

The disk is attributed to a site near [[Nebra (Unstrut)|Nebra]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], in Germany, and [[Archaeological association|associatively]] [[Chronological dating|dated]] to {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;1600 BC. It has been associated with the [[European Bronze Age|Bronze Age]] [[Unetice culture]].

The style in which the disk is executed was unlike any artistic style then known from the period, with the result the object was initially suspected of being a [[forgery]], but it is now widely accepted as authentic.

The Nebra sky disk features the oldest concrete depiction of the [[cosmos]] yet known from anywhere in the world. In June 2013 it was included in the [[UNESCO]] [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World Register]] and termed "one of the most important archaeological finds of the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-6/nebra-sky-disc/ | work=Unesco memory of the World  | title=Nebra Sky Disc | date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The disk, two bronze swords, two hatchets, a chisel, and fragments of spiral bracelets were discovered in 1999 by Henry Westphal and Mario Renner while they were treasure-hunting with a metal detector. Archaeological artifacts are the property of the state in Saxony-Anhalt. The hunters were operating without a license and knew their activity constituted looting and was illegal. They damaged the disk with their spade and destroyed parts of the site. The next day, Westphal and Renner sold the entire hoard for 31,000 [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] to a dealer in [[Cologne]]. The hoard changed hands within Germany over the next two years, being sold for up to a million&amp;nbsp;DM. By 2001 knowledge of its existence had become public. In February 2002 the state archaeologist Harald Meller acquired the disk in a police-led sting operation in [[Basel]] from a couple who had put it on the black market for 700,000&amp;nbsp;DM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Meller, H.|date=January 2004|title=Star search|journal=National Geographic|pages=76–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original finders were eventually traced. In a plea bargain, they led police and archaeologists to the discovery site. Archaeologists opened a dig at the site and uncovered evidence that supports the looters' claims. There are traces of bronze artifacts in the ground, and the soil at the site matches soil samples found clinging to the artifacts. The disk and its accompanying finds are now held at the [[Halle State Museum of Prehistory|State Museum of Prehistory]] in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]].

The two looters received sentences of four months and ten months, respectively, from a [[Naumburg]] court in September 2003. They appealed, but the appeals court raised their sentences to six and twelve months, respectively.

The discovery site is a [[prehistoric enclosure]] encircling the top of a {{convert|252|m}} elevation in the [[Ziegelroda Forest]], known as ''Mittelberg'' ("central hill"), some 60&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Leipzig]]. The surrounding area is known to have been settled in the [[Neolithic]] era, and Ziegelroda Forest contains approximately 1,000 [[tumulus|barrows]].

The enclosure is oriented in such a way that the sun seems to set every [[solstice]] behind the [[Brocken]], the highest peak of the [[Harz]] mountains, some 80&amp;nbsp;km to the north-west. The treasure-hunters claimed the artifacts were discovered within a pit inside the bank-and-ditch enclosure.

==Dating==
[[Image:Nebra Schwerter.jpg|thumb|The [[Bronze Age sword|swords]] found with the disk]]
[[Image:Nebra Hort.jpg|thumb|Other associated finds: chisel, axeheads, bracelets]]
The precise [[Chronological dating|dating]] of the Nebra sky disk depended upon the dating of a number of Bronze Age weapons, which were offered for sale with the disk and said to be from the same site. These axes and swords can be dated typologically to the mid 2nd millennium BC. [[Radiocarbon dating]] of a birchbark particle found on one of the swords to between 1600 and 1560 BC confirmed this estimate. This corresponds to the date of burial, at which time the disk had likely been in existence for several generations.

==Origin of the metals==
According to an initial analysis of trace elements by [[x-ray fluorescence]] by E. Pernicka, then at the [[Freiberg University of Mining and Technology|University of Freiberg]], the copper originated at [[Bischofshofen]] in Austria, while the [[gold]] was thought to be from the [[Carpathian Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Pernicka, E.|author2= Wunderlich, C-H.|last-author-amp= yes|title=Naturwissenschaftliche Untersuchungen an den Funden von Nebra|journal=Archäologie in Sachsen-Anhalt|volume=1/02|pages=24–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent analysis found that the gold used in the first phase was from the [[river Carnon]] in [[Cornwall]], United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=Ehser&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ehser|first=Anja |first2=Gregor|last2=Borg |first3=Ernst|last3=Pernicka |title=Provenance of the gold of the Early Bronze Age Nebra Sky Disk, central Germany: geochemical characterization of natural gold from Cornwall|journal=European Journal of Mineralogy|date=2011|volume=23|issue=6|pages=895–910|doi=10.1127/0935-1221/2011/0023-2140|url=http://eurjmin.geoscienceworld.org/content/23/6/895.short|accessdate=12 November 2013|bibcode=2011EJMin..23..895E}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tin present in the bronze was also of Cornish origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4754.2010.00515.x | volume=52 | title=Tin isotopy: a new method for solving old questions | year=2010 | journal=Archaeometry | pages=816–832 | last1 = Haustein | first1 = M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The disk as preserved was developed in four stages (Meller 2004):
# Initially the disk had thirty-two small round gold circles, a large circular plate, and a large crescent-shaped plate attached. The circular plate is interpreted as either the [[Sun]] or the [[full Moon]], the crescent shape as the [[Lunar phase|crescent Moon]] (or either the Sun or the Moon undergoing [[eclipse]]), and the dots as [[star]]s, with the cluster of seven dots likely representing the [[Pleiades]].
# At some later date, two arcs (constructed from gold of a different origin, as shown by its chemical impurities) were added at opposite edges of the disk. To make space for these arcs, one small circle was moved from the left side toward the center of the disk and two of the circles on the right were covered over, so that thirty remain visible. The two arcs span an angle of 82°, correctly indicating the angle between the positions of sunset at summer and winter [[solstice]] at the latitude of the Mittelberg (51°N)&lt;ref name="McIntosh"&gt;{{cite book | title=Lost Treasures; Civilization's Great Riches Rediscovered | publisher=Carlton Books | author=McIntosh, Jane | year=2010 | location=London | pages=16 | isbn=9781847322999}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Given that the arcs relate to solar phenomena, it is likely the circular plate represents the Sun not the Moon.
# The final addition was another arc at the bottom, the "[[solar barge|sun boat]]", again made of gold from a different origin.
# By the time the disk was buried it also had thirty-nine holes punched out around its perimeter, each approximately 3&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Significance==
The disk may be an [[archaeoastronomy|astronomical]] instrument as well as an item of [[prehistoric religion|religious]] significance. The blue-green patina of the bronze may have been an intentional part of the original artifact.&lt;ref name=meller2002&gt;{{cite journal|author=Meller, H|date=2002|title=Die Himmelsscheibe von Nebra – ein frühbronzezeitlicher Fund von außergewohnlicher Bedeutung|journal=Archäeologie in Sachsen-Anhalt|volume=1/02|pages=7–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The find is regarded as reconfirming that the astronomical knowledge and abilities of the people of the [[European Bronze Age]] included close observation of the yearly course of the [[Sun]], and the angle between its rising and setting points at the summer and winter [[solstice]]s. While much older [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]] and [[megalithic]] [[astronomical complex]]es such as the [[Goseck circle]] and [[Stonehenge]] had already been used to mark the solstices, the disk is the oldest known "portable instrument" to allow such measurements. Pásztor, however, sees no evidence that the disk was a practical device for solar measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Emilia | last = Pásztor | author-link = | editor-last = Ruggles | editor-first = Clive L. N. | chapter = Nebra Disk | title = Handbook of Archaeoastronomy and Ethnoastronomy | date = 2015 | pages = 1349–1356 | place = New York | publisher = Springer Science+Business Media | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4614-6141-8_128 | isbn = 978-1-4614-6140-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Euan MacKie]] suggests that the Nebra disk may be linked to the solar calendar reconstructed by [[Alexander Thom]] from his analysis of standing stone alignments in Britain.&lt;ref name="MacKie2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=MacKie, E|date=2006|chapter=New evidence for a professional priesthood in the European Early Bronze Age?|title=Viewing the Sky Through Past and Present Cultures: Selected Papers from the Oxford VII International Conference on Archaeoastronomy|editor=Todd W. Bostwick|editor2=Bryan Bates|series= [[Pueblo Grande Ruin and Irrigation Sites|Pueblo Grande Museum]] Anthropological Papers |volume=15|publisher=City of Phoenix Parks and Recreation Department|pages=343–362|isbn=1-882572-38-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authenticity==
There were initial suspicions that the disk might be an [[archaeological forgery]]. Peter Schauer of the University of Regensburg, Germany, argued in 2005 that the Nebra disk was a fake and that he could prove that the patina of the disk could have been created with urine, hydrochloric acid and a blow torch within a short amount of time. He had to admit in court that he had never held the disk in his own hands, unlike eighteen scientists who had actually examined the disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/s/RubCD175863466D41BB9A6A93D460B81174/Doc~E4115FE522E3C4CDD89890E5C3B4A9106~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html|title=Himmelsscheibe von Nebra - Eine Komödie der Irrungen|date=March 17, 2005|publisher=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |language=German|accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Harrison, professor of European prehistory at the [[University of Bristol]] and an expert on the [[Beaker people]], allowed his initial reaction to be quoted in a [[BBC]] documentary:&lt;ref name=BBC2008&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2004/stardisctrans.shtml|title=BBC - Science &amp; Nature - Horizon - Secrets of the Star Disc|date=2004|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"When I first heard about the Nebra Disc I thought it was a joke, indeed I thought it was a forgery. Because it’s such an extraordinary piece that it wouldn’t surprise any of us that a clever forger had cooked this up in a backroom and sold it for a lot of money."
Although Harrison had not seen the skydisk when he was interviewed, his skepticism was reasonable at that point, but the disk is widely accepted now as authentic and is dated to roughly 1600 BC on grounds of typological classification of the associated finds.
As the item was not excavated using archaeological methods, even its claimed provenance could have been fictitious - hence its authentication has depended on microphotography of corrosion crystals,&lt;ref name=BBC2008 /&gt; which has produced images of structures that could not be reproduced by a faker.
[[Image:SkyDiscVisitorsCentre.JPG|thumb|The Sky Disc Visitor Center near Nebra]]

Harald Meller, lecturing to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in April 2008, gave a list of facts supporting the authenticity of the disc, and for its having been found at the site on the Mittelberg. The most persuasive of the latter was the discovery by the archaeologists — in the pit in which the looters said they had found the metalwork — of a fragment of gold leaf exactly fitting the gap present in the gold leaf covering of the 'sun' symbol when it was originally recovered.

==Exhibition==
The disk was the center of an exhibition entitled ''Der geschmiedete Himmel'' (German "The [[smithing|smithied]] sky"), showing 1,600 Bronze Age artifacts, including the [[Trundholm sun chariot]], shown at [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] from 15 October 2004 to 22 May 2005, from 1 July to 22 October 2005 in [[Copenhagen]], from 9 November 2005 to 5 February 2006 in [[Vienna]], from 10 March to 16 July 2006 in [[Mannheim]], and from 29 September 2006 to 25 February 2007 in [[Basel]].

On 20 June 2007 a multimedia visitor center was opened near the discovery site at Nebra.

The disk is part of the permanent exhibition in the [[Halle State Museum of Prehistory|Landesmuseum für Vorgeschichte (State Museum of Prehistory)]] in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]].

==Legal issues==
The [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] has registered the disk as a [[trademark]], which has resulted in two lawsuits. In 2003, Saxony-Anhalt successfully sued the city of [[Querfurt]] for depicting the disk design on souvenirs. Saxony-Anhalt also successfully sued the publishing houses [[Piper Verlag|Piper]] and Heyne over an abstracted depiction of the disk on book covers.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelsscheibe von Nebra {{cite web |url=http://www.kalkriese.de/Himmelsscheibe_von_Nebra.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719051336/http://www.kalkriese.de/Himmelsscheibe_von_Nebra.html |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Magdeburg]] court assessed the case's relevance according to [[German copyright law]]. The defenders argued that as a cultic object, the disk had already been "published" in the Bronze Age, and that consequently, all protection of [[intellectual property]] associated with it has long expired. The plaintiff on the other hand, argued that the ''[[editio princeps]]'' of the disk is recent, and according to German law protected for 25 years, until 2027. Another argument concerned the question whether a notable work of art may be registered as a trademark in the first place.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5686">Neuro Biomechanics is based upon the research of [[bioengineering]] researchers, neuro-surgery, orthopedic surgery and biomechanists. Neuro Biomechanics are utilized by neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons and primarily by integrated physical medicine practitioners. Practitioners are focused on aiding people in the restoration of biomechanics of the skeletal system in order to measurably improve nervous system function, health, function, quality of life, reduce pain and the progression of degenerative joint and disc disease.

'''Neuro:''' of or having to do with the nervous system. [[Nervous System]]: An [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] system that [[coordinate]]s the activities of muscles, monitors organs, constructs and processes data received from the senses and initiates actions. The human nervous system coordinates the functions of itself and all organ systems including but not limited to the [[cardiovascular system]], [[respiratory system]], [[skin]], [[digestive system]], [[immune system]], hormonal, metabolic, musculoskeletal, [[endocrine system]], blood and [[reproductive system]]. Optimal function of the organism as a whole depends upon the proper function of the nervous system.

'''Biomechanics:''' (biology, physics) The branch of biophysics that deals with the mechanics of the human or animal body; especially concerned with muscles and the skeleton. The study of biomechanical influences upon nervous system function and load bearing joints.

'''Neurotology''' or '''neuro-otology''' is a branch of clinical medicine which studies and treats neurological disorders of the [[ear]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entfw.com/index-services-neurotology.html Information on Neurotology from the ENT Centre in Fort Wayne] retrieved 25 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It is a subspecialty of [[otolaryngology]]-head and neck surgery, and is closely related to [[otology]], and also draws on the fields of [[neurology]] and [[neurosurgery]]. Otology generally refers to the treatment of middle ear disease and resultant [[conductive hearing loss]], whereas neurotology refers to treatment of inner ear conditions, or hearing and balance disorders. These specialists also work with [[audiologist]]s and related sensory specialists.     

'''Neurotologists''' are [[physician]]s who have specialized in otolaryngology and then further specialized in neurological conditions of the ear and related structures. Many general otolaryngologists are trained in otology or middle ear surgery, performing surgery such as a [[tympanoplasty]], or a reconstruction of the ear drum, when a hole remains from a prior ear tube or prior infection. Otologic surgery also includes treatment of [[conductive hearing loss]] by reconstructing the hearing bones, or [[ossicles]], as a result of infection, or by replacing the stapes bone with a [[stapedectomy]] for [[otosclerosis]]. Neurotology encompasses more complex surgery of the inner ear not typically performed by general otolaryngologists, such as removal of complex [[cholesteatoma]], [[labyrinthectomy]], surgery of the [[endolymphatic sac]] for [[meniere's disease]] and [[cochlear implant]] surgery, because of the additional risk of [[hearing loss]],  [[vertigo]], and [[facial nerve paralysis]]. It is more and more common in the United States as well as around the world for [[otolaryngologist|otolaryngologists]] to obtain additional advanced training in neurotology, which requires an additional one or two years of fellowship training after five years of [[Residency (medicine)|residency]]. 

Historically '''neurotology fellowship programs''' have only been one additional year. Currently most one-year programs are non-accredited programs, but offer training in a wide variety of otologic and neurotologic procedures. Many non-accredited programs do not emphasize surgery of the lateral [[Base of skull|skull base]], but many do offer training in [[acoustic neuromas]], [[glomus jugulare]] and other skull base surgeries. These non-accredited neurotology fellowships are also referred to as advanced otology fellowships. Two-year accredited programs have become a growing trend in the last 5-10 years, and are more geared towards academic training, with the additional year often being more focused on research. The advantage of the additional accreditation, separate from otolaryngology, is to emphasize training in the skull base procedures and qualify these trainees for intracranial surgery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=ocaterminal&amp;L=4&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Licensee&amp;L2=Division+of+Professional+Licensure+Boards&amp;L3=Board+of+Registration+in+Speech-Language+Pathology+and+Audiology&amp;sid=Eoca&amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;f=dpl_boards_sp_faq&amp;csid=Eoca#c1 Frequently Asked Questions about Board of Registration in Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology] retrieved 25 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Field of work==
Conditions treated by neurotologists include:
* Vestibular (balance) diseases, such as [[Ménière's disease]] and [[vestibular neuronitis]]
* Skull base [[tumors]], such as [[vestibular schwannoma]] (acoustic neuroma)
* Facial nerve disorders, including [[facial nerve paralysis]]
* Hearing loss and deafness
* Certain conditions relating to the [[skull base]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earsite.com/ Neurotology research centre]&lt;/ref&gt;
Many of these conditions also relate to [[otology]]

Traditionally an '''oath''' (from [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] ''{{lang|ang|[[:wikt:að|āð]]}}'', also called '''plight''') is either a [[utterance|statement]] of [[fact]] or a [[promise]] with wording relating to something considered [[sacred]] as a sign of verity. A common legal substitute for those who conscientiously object to making sacred oaths is to give an [[Affirmation in law|affirmation]] instead. Nowadays, even when there is no notion of sanctity involved, certain promises said out loud in ceremonial or juridical purpose are referred to as oaths. "To [[:wikt:swear|swear]]" is a [[verb]] used to describe the taking of an oath, to making a solemn [[vow]].

==Divine oath==
Usually oaths have referred to a [[deity]] significant in the cultural sphere in question. The reciter's personal views upon the divinity of the aspects considered sacred in a predictated text of an oath may or may not be taken in to account. There might not be alternative personal proclamations with no mention of the sacred [[dogma]] in question, such as affirmations, to be made. This might mean an [[impasse]] to those with unwillingness to edify the dogma they see as untrue and those who decline to refer to sacred matters on the subject at hand.

The essence of a divine oath is an invocation of divine agency to be a guarantor of the oath taker's own honesty and integrity in the matter under question. By implication, this invokes divine displeasure if the oath taker fails in their sworn duties. It therefore implies greater care than usual in the act of the performance of one's duty, such as in testimony to the facts of the matter in a court of law.

A person taking an oath indicates this in a number of ways. The most usual is the explicit "I swear", but any statement or promise that includes "with * as my witness" or "so help me *", with '*' being something or someone the oath-taker holds sacred, is an oath. Many people take an oath by holding in their hand or placing over their head a book of [[scripture]] or a sacred object, thus indicating the sacred witness through their action: such an oath is called ''corporal''. However, the chief purpose of such an act is for ceremony or solemnity, and the act does not of itself make an oath.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

==Historical development as a legal concept==
Making vows and taking oaths became a symbolic concept in law practice that developed over time in different cultures.

=== Jewish tradition ===
The concept of oaths is deeply rooted within [[Judaism]]. It is found in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 8:21, when God swears that he will "never again curse the ground because of man and never again smite every living thing". This repetition of the term ''never again'' is explained by [[Rashi]], the pre-eminent biblical commentator, as serving as an oath, citing the [[Talmud]] Shavous 36a for this ruling.&lt;ref&gt;Metsudah Chumash and Rashi, KTAV Publishing House, 1991. page 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The first personage in the biblical tradition to take an oath is held to be [[Eliezer]], the chief servant of [[Abraham]], when the latter requested of the former that he not take a wife for his son [[Isaac]] from the daughters of Canaan, but rather from among Abraham's own family.

The foundational text for oath making is in  [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 30:2: "When a man voweth a vow unto the Lord, or sweareth an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth." According to the Rabbis, a [[neder]] (usually translated as "vow") refers to the object, a ''shâmar'' (usually translated as "oath") to the person. The passage distinguishes between a ''neder'' and a ''shvua'', an important distinction between the two in [[Halakha]]: a ''neder'' changes the status of some external thing, while a ''shvua'' initiates an internal change in the one who swears the oath.

=== Roman tradition ===
In the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] tradition, oaths were sworn upon ''[[Iuppiter Lapis]]'' or the Jupiter Stone located in the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Temple of Jupiter]], [[Capitoline Hill]]. ''Iuppiter Lapis'' was held in the Roman tradition to be an [[Oath Stone]], an aspect of Jupiter in his role as divine law-maker responsible for order and used principally for the investiture of the oathtaking of office.

According to Cyril Bailey, in "The Religion of Ancient Rome" (1907):

{{Quote| text=We have, for instance, the sacred stone (''[[Silex#Archaic and foreign uses|silex]]'') which was preserved in the temple of Iuppiter on the Capitol, and was brought out to play a prominent part in the ceremony of treaty-making. The [[fetial]], who on that occasion represented the Roman people, at the solemn moment of the oath-taking, struck the sacrificial pig with the ''silex'', saying as he did so, "Do thou, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Diespiter]], strike the Roman people as I strike this pig here to-day, and strike them the more, as thou art greater and stronger." Here no doubt the underlying notion is not merely symbolical, but in origin the stone is itself the god, an idea which later religion expressed in the cult-title specially used in this connection, ''Iuppiter Lapis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bailey |first=Cyril |date=1907 |title=The Religion of Ancient Rome |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18564/18564-h/18564-h.htm#CHAPTER_II |location=London |publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; Co. Ltd. |page=7 |access-date=2015-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The punisher of broken oaths was the [[Hell|infernal]] deity [[Orcus]].

=== Greek tradition ===
[[Walter Burkert]] has shown that since [[Lycurgus of Athens]] (d. 324 BCE), who held that "it is the oath which holds democracy together", religion, morality and political organization had been linked by the oath, and the oath and its prerequisite altar had become the basis of both civil and criminal, as well as international law.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', trans. Raffan, Harvard University Press (1985), 250ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christian tradition===

Various religious groups have objected to the taking of oaths, most notably the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) and [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] groups, like [[Mennonite]]s, [[Amish]], [[Hutterite]]s and [[Schwarzenau Brethren]]. This is principally based on {{Bibleverse||Matthew|5:34–37}}, the [[Antithesis of the Law]]. Here, Christ is written to say "I say to you: '[[Swear not at all]]{{'"}}. [[James the Just]] stated in {{Bibleverse|James|5:12}}, "Above all, my brothers, do not swear—not by heaven or by earth or by anything else. Let your 'Yes' be yes, and your 'No', no, or you will be condemned." Beyond this scriptural authority, Quakers place importance on being truthful at all times, so the testimony opposing oaths springs from a view that "taking legal oaths implies a double standard of truthfulness"&lt;ref&gt;Faith and Practice of Baltimore Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (1988) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that truthfulness in legal contexts is somehow more important than truthfulness in non-legal contexts and that truthfulness in those other contexts is therefore somehow less important.

Not all [[Christianity|Christians]] interpret this reading as forbidding all types of oaths, however. Opposition to oath-taking among some groups of Christian caused many problems for these groups throughout their history. [[Quaker]]s were frequently imprisoned because of their refusal to swear [[loyalty oath]]s. Testifying in court was also difficult; [[George Fox]], Quakers' founder, famously challenged a judge who had asked him to swear, saying that he would do so once the judge could point to any [[Bible]] passage where Jesus or his apostles took oaths. (The judge could not, but this did not allow Fox to escape punishment.) Legal reforms from the 18th century onwards mean that everyone in the [[United Kingdom]] now has the right to make a solemn [[Affirmation in law|affirmation]] instead of an oath. The [[United States]] has permitted affirmations since it was founded; it is explicitly mentioned in the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. Only President [[Franklin Pierce]] has chosen to affirm rather than swear at his inauguration.

As late as 1880, [[Charles Bradlaugh]] was denied a seat as an MP in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] because of his professed [[atheism]] as he was judged unable to swear the [[Oath of Allegiance (UK)|Oath of Allegiance]] in spite of his proposal to swear the oath as a "matter of form".

=== Islam ===
Islam takes the fulfillment of oaths extremely seriously.
{{quote|God does not hold you responsible for the mere utterance of oaths; He holds you responsible for your actual intentions. If you violate an oath, you shall atone by feeding ten poor people from the same food you offer to your own family, or clothing them, or by freeing a slave. If you cannot afford this, then you shall fast three days. This is the atonement for violating the oaths that you swore to keep. You shall fulfill your oaths. God thus explains His revelations to you, that you may be appreciative.|Quran Chapter 5: Verse 89}}

=== Germanic tradition ===
{{Further|Symbel|Feudalism}}
[[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] [[warrior culture]] was significantly based on oaths of fealty.

A prose passage inserted in the eddic poem ''[[Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar]]'' relates:
Hedin was coming home alone from the forest one [[Yule]]-eve, and found a [[troll]]-woman; she rode on a wolf, and had snakes in place of a bridle. She asked Hedin for his company. "Nay," said he. She said, "Thou shalt pay for this at the ''bragarfull''." That evening the great vows were taken; the sacred boar was brought in, the men laid their hands thereon, and took their vows at the ''bragarfull''. Hedin vowed that he would have Sváva, Eylimi's daughter, the beloved of his brother Helgi; then such great grief seized him that he went forth on wild paths southward over the land, and found Helgi, his brother.

Such Norse traditions are directly parallel to the "bird oaths" of late medieval France, such as the [[voeux du faisan]] (oath on the pheasant) or the (fictional) [[voeux du paon]] (oath on the peacock). Huizinga, ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages]]'' (ch. 3); Michel Margue, "Vogelgelübde" am Hof des Fürsten. Ritterliches Integrationsritual zwischen Traditions- und Gegenwartsbezug (14. – 15. Jahrhundert)

=== Modern law ===
{{redirect|Under oath|the American rock band|Underoath}}
In the modern law, oaths are made by a witness to a court of law before giving testimony and usually by a newly appointed government officer to the people of a state before taking office. 

However, in both of those cases, an [[affirmation in law|affirmation]] can usually be replaced with a written statement, only if the author swears the statement is true. This statement is called an ''[[affidavit]]''. 

The oath given to support an affidavit is frequently administered by a [[notary]], who will certify the giving of the oath by affixing her or his seal to the document. Willfully delivering a false oath (or affirmation) is the crime of [[perjury]]. 

There are some places where there is a confusion between the "oath" and other statements or promises. For example, the current [[Olympic Oath]] is really a [[Promise|pledge]], not properly an oath, since there is only a promise but there is no appeal to a sacred witness.

Oaths may also be confused with [[vow]]s, but vows are really just a special kind of an oath.

== Hand gestures ==

[[File:Anjala.vaakuna.svg|thumb|"Hand on oath" used as a [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]] on the [[coat of arms]] of [[Anjala]], [[Finland]]]]
Instead of, or in addition to, holding one's hand upon an object of ceremonial importance, it can be customary for a person swearing an oath to hold a raised hand in a specific gesture. Most often the right hand is raised. This custom has been explained with reference to medieval practices of branding palms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;se=gglsc&amp;d=454360]&lt;/ref&gt;

===International customs===
The [[Scout Sign]] can be made while giving the [[Scout Promise]]. In ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'' the movement's founder, [[Robert Baden-Powell]], instructed: "While taking this oath the scout will stand, holding his right hand raised level with his shoulder, palm to the front, thumb resting on the nail of the digitus minimus (little finger) and the other three fingers upright, pointing upwards."&lt;ref name="SfB"&gt;{{cite book | first = Lieut.-General R.

'''Orbit-Vis''' is an [[orbit]] simulation program which is designed to allow users to simulate a [[satellite]] in any orbit around the [[Earth]], and to give the user data on the position and motion of the satellite in both visual and numerical form. It is based on information from the book 'Satellite Orbits - Models, Methods and Applications',&lt;ref&gt;Satellite Orbits - Models, Methods and Applications by Oliver Montenbruck and Eberhard Gill&lt;/ref&gt; and is an example of an orbit propagation program utilising the Kepler [[Two-body problem]] for solving elliptical orbits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.braeunig.us/space/orbmech.htm Orbital mechanics]&lt;/ref&gt;

It uses the [[Graphics Device Interface]] to display the calculated orbit as it progresses.

==Features==

The program features two major parts - the input and numerical display window, in which the user can enter a desired [[Apogee]] and [[Perigee]] and press the 'Launch!' button to begin the simulation, and which displays the numerical properties of the orbit in real time, and also the visual display, which consists of a sizeable window displaying the Earth and the orbiting object to scale. Also featured is a control panel which allows the user to manipulate the display window in real time.

The graphical display features [[Multiple buffering|double-buffering]] and the ability to update the inputs while the simulation is running, along with a moveable viewpoint and the ability to pause the simulation.

Version 2.0 also fixed various bugs and cleared up the interface.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to prehistoric technology.

'''[[Prehistoric technology]]''' – [[technology]] that predates [[recorded history]]. History is the study of the past using written records; it is also the record itself. Anything prior to the first written accounts of history is [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] (meaning "before history"), including earlier technologies. About 2.5 million years before writing was developed, technology began with the earliest [[hominid]]s who used [[stone tool]]s, which they may have used to start fires, hunt, cut food, and bury their dead.

== Nature of prehistoric technology ==
{{Human timeline}}
Prehistoric technology can be described as:
* [[Prehistoric]] – "before we had written records," from the Latin word for "before," præ. Prehistory is the span of time before recorded history, that is, before the invention of writing systems.
* [[Technology]] – making, modification, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems, and methods of organization, in order to solve a problem, improve a preexisting solution to a problem, achieve a goal, handle an applied input/output relation or perform a specific function.

== Old World prehistoric technology ==
* [[Three-age system]] – in archaeology and physical anthropology, the periodization of human prehistory into three consecutive time periods, each named after the main material used in its respective tool-making technologies: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age.
* Beginning of prehistoric technology – the earliest technology began (2.5 million years) before recorded history, that is, at the beginning of the Stone Age.
* Latest prehistoric technology – the level of technology reached before true writing was introduced differed by region (and usually included proto-writing)...
** Latest prehistoric technology in the Near East – cultures in the Near East achieved the development of writing first, during their Bronze Age.
** Latest prehistoric technology in the rest of the Old World: Europe, India, and China reached Iron Age technological development before the introduction of writing there.

=== Stone Age technology in the Old World ===
* [[Stone Age]] – broad prehistoric period, lasting roughly 2.5 million years, during which stone was widely used in the manufacture of implements with a sharp edge, a point, or a percussion surface. The period began with hominids and ended between 6000 and 2000 BCE with the advent of metalworking.

==== Paleolithic technology ====
* [[Paleolithic]] – prehistoric period of human history distinguished by the development of the most primitive stone tools discovered (Grahame Clark's Modes I and II), and covers roughly 99% of human technological prehistory.

==== Lower Paleolithic technology ====
* [[Lower Paleolithic]] – earliest subdivision of the [[Paleolithic]] or Old [[Stone Age]]. It spans the time from around [[1 E13 s|2.5 million years]] ago when the first evidence of craft and use of [[stone tool]]s by [[Hominidae|hominids]] appears in the current [[archaeological record]], until around 300,000 years ago, spanning the [[Oldowan]] ("mode 1") and [[Acheulean]] ("mode 2") [[lithic technology]].
** [[Stone tools|Stone tool use]] – early human (hominid) use of stone tool technology, such as the [[hand axe]], was [[Tool use by animals|similar to that of primates]], which is found to be limited to the intelligence levels of modern children aged 3 to 5 years. Ancestors of homo sapiens (modern man) used stone tools as follows:

==== Neolithic Revolution ====
* [[Neolithic Revolution]] – first agricultural revolution, representing a transition from [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] nomadic life to an [[agriculture]] existence.  It evolved independently in six separate locations worldwide circa 10,000–7000 years [[Before Present|BP]] (8,000–5,000 [[Before Christ|BC]]).

=== End of prehistory and the beginning of history ===
* Development of true writing systems – in the Old World, true writing systems developed from [[neolithic]] writing in the [[Early Bronze Age]] ([[4th millennium BC]]).  The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] archaic (pre-[[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]]) writing and the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] are generally considered the earliest true writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BC with earliest coherent texts from about [[26th century BC|2600 BC]].

====Transition from proto-writing to true writing====
* General developmental stages leading from proto-writing to true writing:
** ''Picture writing system'': glyphs directly represent objects and ideas or objective and ideational situations. In connection with this the following substages may be distinguished:
**# The mnemonic: glyphs primarily a reminder;
**# The pictographic (pictography): glyphs represent directly an object or an objective situation such as (A) chronological, (B) notices, (C) communications, (D) totems, titles, and names, (E) religious, (F) customs, (G) historical, and (H) biographical;
**# The ideographic (ideography): glyphs represent directly an idea or an ideational situation.
** ''Transitional system'': glyphs refer not only to the object or idea which it represents but to its name as well.
** ''Phonetic system'': glyphs refer to sounds or spoken symbols irrespective of their meanings. This resolves itself into the following substages:
**# The verbal: glyph ([[logogram]]) represents a whole word;
**# The syllabic: glyph represent a syllable;
**# The alphabetic: glyph represent an elementary sound.

The '''Penn State College of Information Sciences and Technology''', also known as the College of IST, opened in 1999 as the information school of [[The Pennsylvania State University]]. Headquartered at the University Park campus in [[University Park, Pennsylvania]], the college’s programs are offered at 18 Penn State campus locations. [[Andrew Sears|Dr. Andrew Sears]] currently serves as the college’s dean.

The college focuses on the study of issues that exist at the intersection of information, technology, and people, and aims to educate students who can lead in the information age. Work in the college currently focuses on four major trends in education, research, and outreach: the [[internet of things]]; mobile computing and sensing; [[big data]]; and new forms of risk involving cyber insecurity and information privacy.

The College of IST is part of a group of [[i-Schools]] dedicated to advancing the information field. It currently offers four Bachelor of Science degrees; master’s and doctoral degrees; and several undergraduate and graduate degrees and certificates through [[Penn State World Campus]], the University’s online campus.

==History==
The School of Information Sciences and Technology was founded in 1997 and approved by the Penn State Board of Trustees in 1998 based on a need perceived by the University and advisors from government and industry for educating students in the emerging field of information science and technology.&lt;ref name="psu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ist.psu.edu/college/about/history|title=IST History - College of Information Sciences and Technology|website=Ist.psu.edu|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal was to extend beyond classic computer science, management information systems, and library science to prepare students to meet challenges in the use of computers and networked systems for applications such as medicine, business, homeland security, environmental monitoring, and control of complex systems. 

The School was charged with producing graduates who would have basic knowledge of information technologies such as computer programming, discrete mathematics, database concepts, and understanding of information system concepts, as well as the capability to work in teams to understand how information technologies can be utilized in real applications involving individuals, organizations, and ultimately national or global enterprises. 

When it opened in September 1999, the School admitted 105 students, operated 43 courses, and hosted five faculty members. In June 2000, the School offered its first online course.&lt;ref name="psu.edu"/&gt;

The first class of associate degree students graduated in June 2001, with the first class of doctoral students enrolling in August 2001. The School awarded its first bachelor’s degrees to 117 students at the University Park campus in May 2003. The School hosted the first conference of the i-School community in September 2005. 

The School was renamed as the College of Information Sciences and Technology in 2006 – a designation that signified IST’s importance within both the Penn State system and the Commonwealth. 

==Westgate Building (was: IST Building)==
The Westgate Building, formerly known as the [[Information Sciences and Technology Building]] is located on the west campus of The Pennsylvania State University’s University Park campus. The building was formally opened in 2004 as the IST Building and became the home to the College of Information Sciences and Technology and the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

The {{convert|199000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} building was designed by [[Rafael Viñoly|Rafael Vinoly Architects]] in [[New York, New York]] and Perfido Weiskopf Architects in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. The architecture was inspired by the [[Ponte Vecchio]] in [[Florence, Italy]]. The construction of the building is {{convert|199000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} and cost $58.8 million to complete. The building serves as a [[pedestrian bridge]] which permits pedestrian and bicycle traffic over Atherton Street.

The building houses several classrooms and research laboratories, and collaborative spaces. The largest classroom in the building is the Cybertorium. The Cybertorium seats up to 150 people with [[stadium seating]] which faces a large projection screen and a sound system for use by presenters.

The IST Building was re-named Westgate Building in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.psu.edu/story/435792/2016/11/04/campus-life/ist-building-be-renamed-rooms-renumbered|title=IST Building to be renamed, rooms renumbered - Penn State University|website=News.psu.edu|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The College of Information Sciences and Technology founded "IST Startup Week" in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://startupweek.psu.edu/|title=StartUp Week -|website=Startupweek.psu.edu|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The event was created to celebrate a $400,000 gift from David Rusenko, a 2007 graduate of the college who along with Chris Fanini and Dan Veltri co-founded the drag-and-drop website building company, [[Weebly]], while they were students at Penn State. The gift — the largest from a graduate in the college's history — created the "David Rusenko Emerging Entrepreneur Scholarship" and the "David Rusenko Entrepreneur-in-Residence Scholarship," both of which continue to help IST students launch their own companies while they are still in school. 

The event grew to include other colleges and units across campus, and it was renamed to Penn State Startup Week in 2017. Penn State Startup Week is a weeklong series of events that brings entrepreneurs and innovative thought-leaders to campus for presentations, workshops, mentorship, and student pitch competitions. Past events have drawn speakers from around the country, including the founders of and leaders at high-profile companies like Weebly, Dropbox, Reddit, Lands' End, IBM Watson, and Microsoft.

The '''Plant Engineering and Maintenance Association of Canada''' (PEMAC) is a national, not-for-profit industry and technical association for plant and facility maintenance, reliability and physical asset management practitioners and professionals in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pemac.org/ Plant Engineering and Maintenance Association of Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1989, PEMAC was born.

== PEMAC Activities ==
=== Certification Program ===
In an effort to establish a clear set of standards for professional development in the field of maintenance management PEMAC has set about standardizing the training for practitioners and professionals across Canada in cooperation with various Colleges, Institutes and Universities through the [[Maintenance Management Professional]] (MMP) certificate program. Individuals wishing to use the "Maintenance Management Professional" (MMP) designation must complete a 225-hour training program made up of 8 courses, apply for certification from PEMAC and be a member in good standing of the Plant Engineering and Maintenance Association of Canada.  Prior learning recognition is available for up to 6 of the courses.

PEMAC launched a second certificate program in fall 2014 that introduces tools for strategic decision making at each stage of the asset lifecycle. The Asset Management Professional (AMP) Certificate program presents participants with the latest in strategic asset management thinking from recognized global organizations, while developing the capacity to engage others and build their knowledge and skill in key subject areas such as risk management, knowledge management (enterprise database systems).

The AMP program is designed for mid-career professionals from a variety of backgrounds (IT, engineering and business management) who have responsibility for managing decisions with respect to the core life cycle functions such as design, selection, operation, and maintenance of an organization’s assets. Similar to PEMAC’s signature MMP program, the AMP program it finishes with a “Capstone” project, offering the opportunity to apply the participants' new knowledge and skills to develop a real-life project recommendation. The first set of participants completed the program in winter of 2016, and were the first in the world to be CAMP certified.

The MMP program has been recognized by Alberta Industry Training for the Blue Seal "Achievement in Business Competencies" program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tradesecrets.gov.ab.ca/index.html?page=working_in_alberta/business_credentials.html Alberta Industry Training - Business Competencies]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition both the Alberta Water Wastewater Operators Association  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awwoa.ab.ca/?object=6 AWWOA Recognized CEUs]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ontario Water and Wastewater Certification Office&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.owwco.ca/ Ontario Water and Wastewater Certification Office]&lt;/ref&gt; recognize courses in the program for Continuing Education Credits. PEMAC is also recognized by the Society for Maintenance and Reliability Professionals (SMRP) as an "Approved Education Provider". Consider studying MMP or AMP courses if you are seeking to achieve -or- maintain your CMRP certification.

=== Chapter Activity ===
Local chapters organize regular networking and professional development events across the country.

D.|author2=Aleman, E. |author3=Maxcy, B. |title=Emergence of the Politics of Education Field: Making Sense of the Messy Center|journal=Educational Administration Quarterly|date=February 1, 2003|volume=39|issue=1|pages=10–40|doi=10.1177/0013161X02239759}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Political science attempts to explain how societies and [[social organization]]s use [[Political power|power]] to establish regulations and allocate resources.  Organizational theory uses [[scientific theories]] of management to develop deeper understandings regarding the function of organizations.

Researchers have drawn a distinction between two types of politics in [[school]]s.  The term ''micropolitics'' refers to the use of formal and informal power by individuals and groups to achieve their goals in organizations. Cooperative and conflictive processes are integral components of micropolitics. ''Macropolitics'' refers to how power is used and decision making is conducted at district, state, and federal levels.  Macropolitics is generally considered to exist outside the school, but researchers have noted that micro- and macropolitics may exist at any level of school systems depending on circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blasé |first=J. |author2=Blase, J.|title=The Micropolitics of Instructional Supervision: A Call for Research |journal=Educational Administration Quarterly |date=February 1, 2002|volume=38|issue=1|pages=6–44|doi=10.1177/0013161X02381002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist significant difference between "Politics of Education" and "Politics in Education". More debates on the preavailing differences are solicited from academia of the world to define politics educationally.

A '''prefabricated building''', informally a '''prefab''', is a building that is manufactured and constructed using [[prefabrication]]. It consists of factory-made components or units that are transported and assembled on-site to form the complete building.

==History==
[[File:Villa Undine.JPG|thumb|''Villa Undine'' in [[Binz]] on German [[Rügen|Rugia Island]], built in 1885 by ''Wolgaster Holzbau''.]]

Buildings have been built in one place and reassembled in another throughout history. This was especially true for mobile activities, or for new settlements; [[Great House (Cape Ann)|one of the first buildings]] at [[Cape Ann]] in 1624 was probably partially prefabricated, and was rapidly disassembled and moved at least once. [[John Rollo]] described in 1801 earlier use of portable hospital buildings in the [[West Indies]]&lt;ref name="Rollo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rollo|first1=John|title=A short account of the Royal Artillery Hospital at Woolwich: with some observations on the management of artillery soldiers, respecting the preservation of health.|date=1801|publisher=Mawman|location=London|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly the first advertised prefab house was the "Manning cottage". A London carpenter, Henry Manning, constructed a house that was built in components, then shipped and assembled by British emigrants. This was published at the time (advertisement, South Australian Record, 1837) and a few still stand in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94119708 Prefab: From Utilitarian Home To Design Icon], by Jim Zarroli, Morning Edition, September 15, 2008, NPR&lt;/ref&gt; One such is the [[Friends Meeting House, Adelaide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postcards-sa.com.au/features2009/quakers_meeting_house.html Channel 9 South Australia Pty Ltd &gt; Postcards &gt; Friend's Meeting House] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317183329/http://www.postcards-sa.com.au/features2009/quakers_meeting_house.html |date=2012-03-17 }} Retrieved 8 September 2011

The peak year for the importation of portable buildings to Australia was 1853, when several hundred arrived. These have been identified as coming from [[Liverpool]], [[Boston]] and [[Singapore]] (with Chinese instructions for re-assembly).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

As the buildings were moveable they were legally regarded as [[Personal property|chattel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1855 during the [[Crimean War]], after [[Florence Nightingale]] wrote a letter to ''[[The Times]]'', [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] was commissioned to design a prefabricated modular hospital. In five months he designed the [[Renkioi Hospital]]: a 1,000 patient hospital, with innovations in sanitation, ventilation and a flushing toilet.&lt;ref&gt;Renkioi: Brunel's Forgotten Crimean War Hospital by Christopher Silver&lt;/ref&gt; Fabricator [[William Eassie]] constructed the required 16 units in [[Gloucester Docks]], shipped directly to the [[Dardanelles]]. Only used from March 1856 to September 1857, it reduced the death rate from 42% to 3.5%.

The world's first prefabricated, pre-cast panelled apartment blocks were pioneered in [[Liverpool]]. A process was invented by city engineer [[John Alexander Brodie]], whose inventive genius also had him inventing the football goal net. The tram stables at Walton in [[Liverpool]] followed in 1906.  The idea was not extensively adopted in Britain, however was widely adopted elsewhere, particularly in Eastern Europe.

Prefabricated homes were produced during the [[Gold Rush]] in the United States, when kits were produced to enable Californian prospectors to quickly construct accommodation. Homes were available in kit form by mail order in the United States in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chetboddy.com/Pages/factorybuilt.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902005129/http://www.chetboddy.com/Pages/factorybuilt.html |archivedate=2006-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prefabricated housing was popular during the [[World War II|Second World War]] due to the need for mass accommodation for military personnel. The United States used [[Quonset hut]]s as military buildings, and in the United Kingdom prefabricated buildings used included [[Nissen hut]]s and [[Bellman Hangar]]s. 'Prefabs' were built after the war as a means of quickly and cheaply providing quality housing as a replacement for the housing destroyed during [[the Blitz]]. The proliferation of prefabricated housing across the country was a result of the [[Burt Committee]] and the [[Housing (Temporary Accommodation) Act 1944]]. Under the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]] [[Emergency Factory Made]] housing programme, a specification was drawn up and bid on by various private construction and manufacturing companies. After approval by the MoW, companies could bid on Council led development schemes, resulting in whole estates of prefabs constructed to provide accommodation for those made homeless by the War and ongoing [[slum clearance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/interesting/prefabs/prefabs.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008181601/http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/interesting/prefabs/prefabs.htm |archivedate=2006-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 160,000 had been built in the UK by 1948 at a cost of close to £216 million. The largest single prefab estate in Britain&lt;ref&gt;[[Belle Vale, Liverpool]]&lt;/ref&gt; was at [[Belle Vale]] (South Liverpool), where more than 1,100 were built after World War 2. The estate was demolished in the 1960s amid much controversy as the prefabs were very popular with residents at the time.
[[File:Prefabfrontroom.jpg|thumb|Amersham Prefab (COAM)-front room showing solid-fuel fire]]
Prefabs were aimed at families, and typically had an entrance hall, two bedrooms (parents and children), a bathroom (a room with a bath) &amp;nbsp;— which was a novel innovation for many Britons at that time, a separate toilet, a living room and an equipped (not ''fitted'' in the modern sense) kitchen. Construction materials included steel, aluminium, timber or [[asbestos]], depending on the type of dwelling. The aluminium ''Type B2'' prefab was produced as four pre-assembled sections which could be transported by lorry anywhere in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.walespast.com/article-print.shtml?id=73 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518065604/http://www.walespast.com/article-print.shtml?id=73 |archive-date=2006-05-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Universal House (pictured left &amp; lounge diner right) was given to the [[Chiltern Open Air Museum]] after 40 years temporary use. The Mark 3 was manufactured by the Universal Housing Company Ltd, Rickmansworth.

The United States used prefabricated housing for troops during the war and for GIs returning home. ''Prefab'' classrooms were popular with UK schools increasing their rolls during the [[baby boom]] of the 1950s and 1960s.

Many buildings were designed with a five-ten year life span, but have far exceeded this, with a number surviving today. In 2002, for example, the city of [[Bristol]] still had residents living in 700 examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/main.jhtml?xml=/property/2002/03/23/prefab23.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=The prefab four | first=Lesley | last=Gillilan | date=March 23, 2002 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many UK councils have been in the process of demolishing the last surviving examples of Second World War prefabs in order to comply with the British government's [[Decent Homes Standard]], which came into effect in 2010. There has, however, been a recent revival in prefabricated methods of construction in order to compensate for the United Kingdom's current housing shortage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/mortgages/article.html?in_article_id=407133&amp;in_page_id=8|title=New age of the prefab house|work=This is Money}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prefabs and the modernist movement==
Architects are incorporating modern designs into the prefabricated houses of today. Prefab housing should no longer be compared to a mobile home in terms of appearance, but to that of a complex modernist design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportablehomefinance.com.au/transportableHomeExplained.html|title=Transportable Homes, Explained|publisher=Transportable home finance|accessdate=2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been an increase in the use of "green" materials in the construction of these prefab houses. Consumers can easily select between different environmentally friendly finishes and wall systems. Since these homes are built in parts, it is easy for a home owner to add additional rooms or even solar panels to the roofs. Many prefab houses can be customized to the client's specific location and climate, making prefab homes much more flexible and modern than before.

There is a [[zeitgeist]] in architectural circles and the spirit of the age favors the small carbon footprint of "prefab." Eminent amongst the new breed of off the shelf luxury modernist products is the perrinepod,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inhabitat.com/2007/08/10/prefab-friday-perrinepod/|title=PREFAB FRIDAY: Perrinepod|work=inhabitat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has found favor worldwide for its green credentials and three-day build time.

Many eastern European countries had suffered physical damage during [[World War Two]] and their economies were in a very poor state. There was a need to reconstruct cities which had been severely damaged due to the war. For example, [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]] had been practically razed to the ground under the planned destruction of Warsaw by German forces after the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]]. The centre of [[Dresden]], Germany had been totally destroyed by the 1945 Allied bombardment. Stalingrad had been largely destroyed and only a small number of structures were left standing.

Prefabricated buildings served as an inexpensive and quick way to alleviate the massive housing shortages associated with the wartime destruction and large-scale [[urbanization]] and [[rural flight]].

'''Public opinion on global warming''' is the aggregate of [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] or [[belief]]s held by the adult population concerning the science, economics, and politics of [[global warming]]. It is affected by [[media coverage of climate change]].

A 2007–2008 [[Gallup Poll]] surveyed individuals in 128 countries. This poll queried whether the respondent knew of global warming. Those who had a basic concept of global warming didn’t necessarily connect it to human activities, revealing that a knowledge of global warming and the knowledge that it’s human-induced are two separate things. Over a third of the world's population were unaware of global warming. [[Developing country|Developing countrie]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s have less awareness than [[Developed country|developed]], and Africa the least aware. Of those aware, residents of [[Latin America]] and developed countries in Asia led the belief that climate change is a result of human activities while Africa, parts of Asia and the Middle East, and a few countries from the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] led in the opposite. Opinion within the United Kingdom was divided.&lt;ref name="Pelham2009Awareness"&gt;{{Cite web|first=Brett|last=Pelham|title=Awareness, Opinions About Global Warming Vary Worldwide|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/117772/Awareness-Opinions-Global-Warming-Vary-Worldwide.aspx|publisher=[[The Gallup Organization]]|date=22 April 2009|accessdate=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major worldwide poll, conducted by Gallup in 2008–2009 in 127 countries, found that some 62% of people worldwide said they knew about global warming. In the [[Developed country|industrialized countries]] of North America, Europe and Japan, 90% or more knew about it (97% in the U.S., 99% in Japan); in [[Developing country|developing countries]], especially in Africa, fewer than a quarter knew about it, although many had noticed local weather changes. Among those who knew about global warming, there was a wide variation between nations in belief that the warming was a result of human activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/117772/Awareness-Opinions-Global-Warming-Vary-Worldwide.aspx|title=Awareness, Opinions about Global Warming Vary Worldwide| last=Pelham | first=Brett | publisher=Gallup |year=2009 | accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adults in Asia, with the exception of those in developed countries, are the least likely to perceive global warming as a threat. In the western world, individuals are the most likely to be aware and perceive it as a very or somewhat serious threat to themselves and their families;&lt;ref name="PuglieseJulie2009AwarenessThreat"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/124652/Awareness-Climate-Change-Threat-Vary-Region.aspx|title=Awareness of Climate Change and Threat Vary by Region|last1=Pugliese|first1=Anita|last2=Ray|first2=Julie|date=11 December 2009|publisher=[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]]|accessdate=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Europeans are more concerned about climate change than those in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/04/health/04iht-poll.4102536.html?_r=1|title=More in Europe worry about climate than in U.S., poll shows|last=Crampton|first=Thomas|date=1 January 2007|work=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=26 December 2009|publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the public in Africa, where individuals are the most vulnerable to global warming while producing the least carbon dioxide, is the least aware – which translates into a low perception that it is a threat.&lt;ref name="PuglieseJulie2009AwarenessThreat" /&gt;

These variations pose a challenge to [[policymaker]]s, as different countries travel down different paths, making an agreement over an appropriate response difficult. While Africa may be the most vulnerable and produce the least amount of greenhouse gases, they are the most ambivalent. The top five emitters ([[PRC|China]], the United States, India, Russia, and Japan), who together emit half the world's greenhouse gases, vary in both awareness and concern. The United States, Russia, and Japan are the most aware at over 85% of the population. Conversely, only two-thirds of people in China and one-third in India are aware. Japan expresses the greatest concern, which translates into support for environmental policies. People in China, Russia, and the United States, while varying in awareness, have expressed a similar proportion of aware individuals concerned. Similarly, those aware in India are likely to be concerned, but India faces challenges spreading this concern to the remaining population as its energy needs increase over the next decade.&lt;ref name="PuglieseJulie2009TopEmittingCountries"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/124595/Top-Emitting-Countries-Differ-Climate-Change-Threat.aspx|title=Top-Emitting Countries Differ on Climate Change Threat|first1=Anita|last1=Pugliese|first2=Julie|last2=Ray|date=7 December 2009|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An online survey on environmental questions conducted in 20 countries by Ipsos MORI, "Global Trends 2014", shows broad agreement, especially on climate change and if it is caused by humans, though the U.S. ranked lowest with 54% agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsosglobaltrends.com/environment.html|title=Global Trends 2014|author=Ipsos MORI|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223081447/http://www.ipsosglobaltrends.com/environment.html|archivedate=23 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the low U.S. ranking is tied to [[Climate change denial#Denial networks|denial campaigns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/07/climate-denial-us-uk-australia-canada-english|title=The Strange Relationship Between Global Warming Denial and…Speaking English|date=July 22, 2014|author=MotherJones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 survey of 14 [[Developed country|industrialized countries]] found that [[Climate change skeptics|skepticism]] about the danger of global warming was highest in Australia, Norway, New Zealand and the United States, in that order, correlating positively with [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions|per capita emissions of carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tranter|first1=Bruce|last2=Booth|first2=Kate|title=Scepticism in a Changing Climate: A Cross-national Study|journal=Global Environmental Change|date=July 2015|volume=33|pages=54–164|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 [[Yale University]] conducted a study identifying global warming's 'Six Americas'. The report identifies six audiences with different opinions about global warning: The alarmed (18%), the concerned (33%), the cautious (19%), the disengaged (12%), the doubtful (11%) and the dismissive (7%). The alarmed and concerned make out the largest percentage and think something should be done about global warming. The cautious, disengaged and doubtful are less likely to take action. The dismissive are convinced global warming is not happening. These audiences can be used to define the best approaches for environmental action.

Opinions in the United States vary intensely enough to be considered a [[culture war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/science/earth/americans-link-global-warming-to-extreme-weather-poll-says.html | work=The New York Times | first=Justin | last=Gillis | title=Americans Link Global Warming to Extreme Weather, Poll Says | date=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/climate_science_as_culture_war ''Climate Science as Culture War: The public debate around climate change is no longer about science&amp;nbsp;– it’s about values, culture, and ideology''] Fall 2012 [[Stanford Social Innovation Review]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a January 2013 survey, Pew found that 69% of Americans say there is solid evidence that the Earth's average temperature has gotten warmer over the past few decades, up six points since November 2011 and 12 points since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130515145510/http://www.pewresearch.org/2013/04/02/climate-change-key-data-points-from-pew-research/ Climate Change: Key Data Points from Pew Research | Pew Research Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

A Gallup poll in 2014 concluded that 51 percent of Americans were a little or not at all worried about climate change, 24 percent a great deal and 25 percent a fair amount.&lt;ref name="Riffkin"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Riffkin|first1=Rebecca|title=Climate Change Not a Top Worry in U.S.|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/167843/climate-change-not-top-worry.aspx|accessdate=21 July 2014|publisher=Gallup|date=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2015, 32 percent or Americans were worried about global warming as a great deal, 37 percent in 2016, and 45 percent in 2017. A poll taken in 2016 shows that 52% of Americans believe climate change to be [[causes of global warming|caused by human activity]], while 34% state it is caused by natural changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2016/?est=happening&amp;type=value&amp;geo=county|title=Yale Climate Opinion Maps - U.S. 2016 - Yale Program on Climate Change Communication|work=Yale Program on Climate Change Communication|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data is increasingly showing that 62 percent of Americans believe that the [[effects of global warming]] are happening now in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/206030/global-warming-concern-three-decade-high.aspx|title=Global Warming Concern at Three-Decade High in U.S.|last=Inc.|first=Gallup,|work=Gallup.com|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 [[Gallup (company)|GALLUP]] found that 64% of Americans are worried about global warming, 59% believed that global warming is already happening and 65% is convinced that global warming is caused by human activities. These numbers show that awareness of global warming is increasing in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/190010/concern-global-warming-eight-year-high.aspx|title=U.S. Concern About Global Warming at Eight-Year High|last=Inc.|first=Gallup,|work=Gallup.com|access-date=25 April 2018|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
In countries varying in awareness, an educational gap translates into a gap in awareness.&lt;ref name=gap&gt;[http://www.cultureuniversity.com/closing-massive-gaps-between-culture-awareness-education-action/ Closing the Massive Gaps Between Culture Awareness, Education, and Action]&lt;/ref&gt; However an increase in awareness does not always result in an increase in perceived threat. In China, 98% of those who have completed four years or more of college education reported knowing something or a great deal of climate change while only 63% of those who have completed nine years of education reported the same. Despite the differences in awareness in China, all groups perceive a low level of threat from global warming. In India those who are educated are more likely to be aware, and those who are educated there are far more likely to report perceiving global warming as a threat than those who are not educated.&lt;ref name="PuglieseJulie2009TopEmittingCountries" /&gt; In Europe, individuals who have attained a higher level of education perceive climate change as a serious threat. There is also a strong association between education and Internet use. Europeans who use the Internet more are more likely to perceive climate change as a serious threat.&lt;ref name="Eurobarometer2009p13" /&gt; However, a survey of American adults found that "...there is in fact little disagreement among culturally diverse citizens{{clarify|date=August 2016}} on what science knows about climate change. The source of the climate-change controversy and like disputes over societal risks is the contamination of the science-communication environment with forms of cultural status competition that make it impossible for diverse citizens to express their reason as both collective-knowledge acquirers and cultural-identity protectors at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Kahan| first =Dan| title =Climate-Science Communication and the Measurement Problem| journal =Advances in Political Psychology| volume =36| issue =s1| pages =1–43| date =20 February 2015| url =http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pops.12244/full| doi =10.1111/pops.12244| accessdate =26 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Climate Science Literacy Unrelated to Public Acceptance of Human-Caused Global Warming| website =Yale Law School| date =23 February 2015| url =http://www.law.yale.edu/news/19377.htm| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150326010101/http://www.law.yale.edu/news/19377.htm| dead-url =yes| archivedate =26 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Lott| first =Maxim| title =Study: Global warming skeptics know more about climate science| newspaper =Fox News| date =12 February 2015| url =http://www.foxnews.com/science/2015/02/12/study-global-warming-skeptics-know-more-about-climate-science/| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographics===

Residential [[demographics]] affect perceptions of global warming. In China, 77% of those who live in urban areas are aware of global warming compared to 52% in rural areas. This trend is mirrored in India with 49% to 29% awareness, respectively.&lt;ref name="PuglieseJulie2009TopEmittingCountries" /&gt;

Of the countries where at least half the population is aware of global warming, those with the majority who believe that global warming is due to human activities have a greater national GDP per unit energy—or, a greater energy efficiency.&lt;ref name="Pelham2009Energy"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/117835/Views-Global-Warming-Relate-Energy-Efficiency.aspx|title=Views on Global Warming Relate to Energy Efficiency|first=Brett W.|last=Pelham|date=24 April 2009|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, individuals under fifty-five are more likely to perceive both "poverty, lack of food and drinking water" and climate change as a serious threat than individuals over fifty-five. Male individuals are more likely to perceive climate change as a threat than female individuals. Managers, white collar workers, and students are more likely to perceive climate change as a greater threat than house persons and retired individuals.&lt;ref name="Eurobarometer2009p13"&gt;{{harvnb|TNS Opinion and Social|2009|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, conservative white men are more likely than other Americans to deny climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCright|first1=Aaron M.|last2=Dunlap|first2=Riley E.|title=Cool dudes: The denial of climate change among conservative white males in the United States|journal=Global Environmental Change|date=October 2011|volume=21|issue=4|pages=1163–72|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political identification===
In the United States, support for environmental protection was relatively [[non-partisan]] in the twentieth century. Republican [[Theodore Roosevelt]] established national parks whereas Democrat [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] established the [[Soil Conservation Service]]. Republican [[Richard Nixon]] was instrumental in founding the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and tried to install a third pillar of [[NATO]] dealing with environmental challenges such as acid rain and greenhouse effect. [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] was Nixon's NATO delegate for the topic.&lt;ref name="Hüne"&gt;Die Frühgeschichte der globalen Umweltkrise und die Formierung der deutschen Umweltpolitik(1950–1973) (Early history of the environmental crisis and the setup of German environmental policy 1950–1973), Kai F. Hünemörder, Franz Steiner Verlag, 2004 ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;

This non-partisanship began to erode during the 1980s, when the [[Reagan administration]] described environmental protection as an economic burden. Views over global warming began to seriously diverge between Democrats and Republicans during the negotiations that led up to the creation of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in 1998. In a 2008 Gallup poll of the American public, 76% of Democrats and only 41% of Republicans said that they believed global warming was already happening. The opinions of the [[political elite]]s, such as members of Congress, tends to be even more polarized.&lt;ref name="Dunlap2008RepublicanDemocraticGap"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/107569/ClimateChange-Views-RepublicanDemocratic-Gaps-Expand.aspx|title=Climate-Change Views: Republican-Democratic Gaps Expand|first=Riley E.|last=Dunlap|date=29 May 2009|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, opinion is not strongly divided among [[Left-right politics|left and right parties]]. Although European political parties on the left, including [[Green parties]], strongly support measures to address climate change, conservative European political parties maintain similar sentiments, most notably in Western and Northern Europe. For example, [[Margaret Thatcher]], never a friend of the coal mining industry, was a strong supporter of an active climate protection policy and was instrumental in founding the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and the British [[Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2013/04/thatchers-climate-change-greatest-hits How Margaret Thatcher Made the Conservative Case for Climate Action], James West, ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'', Mon Apr. 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Some speeches, as to the Royal Society on 27 September 1988&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/107346 1988 Sep 27 Tu Margaret Thatcher Speech to the Royal Society]&lt;/ref&gt; and to the UN general assembly in November 1989 helped to put climate change, acid rain, and general pollution in the British mainstream. After her career, however, Thatcher was less of a climate activist, as she called climate action a "marvelous excuse for supranational socialism," and called Al Gore an "apocalyptic hyperbole".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/04/08/margaret_thatcher_s_environmental_record_she_was_a_climate_hawk.html An Inconvenient Truth About Margaret Thatcher: She Was a Climate Hawk], Will Oremus, [[Slate (magazine)]] April 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; France's center-right [[Jacques Chirac|President Chirac]] pushed key environmental and climate change policies in France in 2005–2007. Conservative German administrations (under the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]]) in the past two decades have supported [[European Union]] climate change initiatives; concern about [[forest dieback]] and [[acid rain]] regulation were initiated under Kohl's archconservative minister of the interior [[Friedrich Zimmermann]]. In the period after former President George W. Bush announced that the United States was leaving the [[Kyoto Treaty]], European media and newspapers on both the left and right criticized the move. The conservative Spanish ''[[La Razón (Madrid)|La Razón]]'', the ''[[Irish Times]]'', the ''[[Irish Independent]]'', the Danish ''[[Berlingske Tidende]]'', and the Greek ''[[Kathimerini]]'' all condemned the Bush administration's decision, as did left-leaning newspapers.&lt;ref name="SchreursAndTiberghien2007"&gt;{{cite journal | first1= M.

In Norway, a 2013 poll conducted by [[TNS Gallup]] found that 92% of those who vote for the [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]] and 89% of those who vote for the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]] believe that global warming is caused by humans, while the percentage who held this belief is 60% among voters for the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] and 41% among voters for the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]].&lt;ref&gt;"Among those who vote for the Liberal Party or the Socialist Party, the great majority think that humans are behind climate changes (89 and 92%). Only 41% of those who vote for the Progress Party agree, while the number for Conservative Party voters is 60%." (Translated from Norwegian to English) Liv Jorun Andenes and Amalie Kvame Holm: [http://www.vl.no/helg/godt-klima-for-skepsis/ Typisk norsk å være klimaskeptisk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708104143/http://www.vl.no/helg/godt-klima-for-skepsis/ |date=8 July 2013 }} {{no icon}} [[Vårt Land (Norwegian newspaper)|''Vårt Land'']], retrieved 8 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The shared sentiments between the political left and right on climate change further illustrate the divide in perception between the United States and Europe on climate change. As an example, conservative German Prime Ministers [[Helmut Kohl]] and [[Angela Merkel]] have differed with other parties in Germany only on how to meet emissions reduction targets, not whether or not to establish or fulfill them.&lt;ref name="SchreursAndTiberghien2007" /&gt;

A 2017 study found that those who changed their opinion on climate change between 2010 and 2014 did so "primarily to align better with those who shared their party identification and political ideology. This conforms with the theory of motivated reasoning: Evidence consistent with prior beliefs is viewed as strong and, on politically salient issues, people strive to bring their opinions into conformance with those who share their political identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palm|first=Risa|last2=Lewis|first2=Gregory B.|last3=Feng|first3=Bo|date=2017-03-13|title=What Causes People to Change Their Opinion about Climate Change?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2016.1270193|journal=Annals of the American Association of Geographers|volume=0|pages=1–14|doi=10.1080/24694452.2016.1270193|issn=2469-4452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheldon Ungar, a Canadian sociologist, compares the different public reactions towards [[ozone depletion and global warming]].&lt;ref name = Ungar/&gt; The public opinion failed to tie climate change to concrete events which could be used as a threshold or beacon to signify immediate danger.&lt;ref name = Ungar/&gt; Scientific predictions of a temperature rise of two to three degrees Celsius over several decades do not respond with people, e.g. in North America, that experience similar swings during a single day.&lt;ref name = Ungar/&gt; As scientists define global warming a problem of the future, a liability in "[[attention economy]]", pessimistic outlooks in general and assigning extreme weather to climate change have often been discredited or ridiculed (compare [[Gore effect]]) in the public arena.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Ungar Climatic Change February 1999, Volume 41, Issue 2, pp 133-150 Is Strange Weather in the Air? A Study of U.S. National Network News Coverage of Extreme Weather Events&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[greenhouse effect]] ''[[per se (Latin)|per se]]'' is essential for life on earth, the case was quite different with the [[ozone shield]] and other metaphors about the ozone depletion. The scientific assessment of the ozone problem also had large uncertainties. But the metaphors used in the discussion (ozone shield, ozone hole) reflected better with lay people and their concerns.

{{"|The idea of rays penetrating a damaged “shield” meshes nicely with abiding and resonant cultural motifs, including “Hollywood affinities.” These range from the shields on the Starship Enterprise to Star Wars, ... It is these pre-scientific bridging metaphors built around the penetration of a deteriorating shield that render the ozone problem relatively simple. That the ozone threat can be linked with Darth Vader means that it is encompassed in common sense understandings that are deeply ingrained and widely shared. (Sheldon Ungar 2000)&lt;ref name = Ungar/&gt;}}

The chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) regulation attempts of the end of the 1980s profited from those easy-to-grasp metaphors and the personal risk assumptions taken from them. As well the fate of celebrities like President [[Ronald Reagan]], which had skin cancer removal in 1985 and 1987, was of high importance. In case of the public opinion on climate change, no imminent danger is perceived.&lt;ref name=Ungar&gt;Knowledge, ignorance and the popular culture: climate change versus the ozone hole, by Sheldon Ungar, {{doi|10.1088/0963-6625/9/3/306}} Public Understanding of Science July 2000 vol. 9 no. 3 297–312 [https://web.archive.org/web/20140908033209/http://pus.sagepub.com/content/9/3/297.short Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 BBC World Service poll found that when asked about various policy options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - tax incentives for alternative energy research and development, installment of taxes to encourage energy conservation, and reliance on nuclear energy to reduce fossil fuels. The majority of those asked felt that tax incentives were the path of action that they preferred.

As of May 2016, polls have repeatedly found that a majority of Republican voters, particularly young ones, believe the government should take action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/21/science/donald-trump-global-warming-energy-policy-kevin-cramer.html | work=The New York Times | first=Erica | last=Goode | title=What Are Donald Trump’s Views on Climate Change?

===Economics===
{{See also|Economics of global warming}}

Economic debates weigh the benefits of limiting industrial emissions of mitigating global warming against the costs that such changes would entail. While there is a greater amount of agreement over whether global warming exists, there is less agreement over the appropriate response. Electric or petroleum distribution may be government owned or utilities may be regulated by government. The government owned or regulated utilities may, or may not choose to make lower emissions a priority over economics, in unregulated counties industry follows economic priorities. An example of the economic priority is [[Royal Dutch Shell#Environmental pollution|Royal Dutch Shell PLC]] reporting CO2 emissions of 81 million metric tonnes in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Dutch Shell PLC – AMEE |url=https://www.amee.com/companies/006723599-royal-dutch-shell-plc#/tabs/environmental}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popular media in the U.S. gives greater attention to skeptics relative to the scientific community as a whole, and the level of agreement within the scientific community has not been accurately communicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = M.| first2 = J. | title = Balance as bias: global warming and the US prestige press| last1 = Boykoff | journal = Global Environmental Change Part A | volume = 14| issue =  2 | pages = 125–36 | date = July 2004 | doi = 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2003.10.001| last2 =  Boykoff| url = http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/publications/downloads/boykoff04-gec.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2005.08.003| title = Climate of scepticism: US newspaper coverage of the science of climate change| url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.372.2033&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf| year = 2005| last1 = Antilla | first1 = L.| journal = Global Environmental Change Part A| volume = 15| issue = 4| pages = 338–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt; US popular media coverage differs from that presented in other countries, where reporting is more consistent with the scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1108/01443330310790327 | title = Media's social construction of environmental issues: focus on global warming – a comparative study | year = 2003 | last1 = Dispensa | first1 = J.

The efforts of [[Al Gore]] and other environmental campaigns have focused on the effects of global warming and have managed to increase awareness and concern, but despite these efforts as of 2007, the number of Americans believing humans are the cause of global warming was holding steady at 61%, and those believing the popular media was understating the issue remained about 35%.&lt;ref name="Saad2007HollywoodHeathUpConcern"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/26932/Did-Hollywoods-Glare-Heat-Public-Concern-About-Global-Warming.aspx|title=Did Hollywood's Glare Heat Up Public Concern About Global Warming?|first=Lydia|last=Saad|date=21 March 2007|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 2010 and 2013, the number of Americans who believe the media under-reports the seriousness of global warming has been increasing, and the number who think media over-states it has been falling.   According to a 2013 Gallup US opinion poll, 57% believe global warming is at least as bad as portrayed in the media (with 33% thinking media has downplayed global warming and 24% saying coverage is accurate).  Less than half of Americans (41%) think the problem is not as bad as media portrays it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Saad|first=Lydia|title=Americans' Concerns About Global Warming on the Rise|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/161645/americans-concerns-global-warming-rise.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

September 2011 [[Angus Reid Public Opinion]] poll found that Britons (43%) are less likely than Americans (49%) or Canadians (52%) to say that "global warming is a fact and is mostly caused by emissions from vehicles and industrial facilities."

===Politics===
{{See also|Politics of global warming}}

Public opinion impacts on the issue of climate change because governments need willing electorates and citizens in order to implement policies that address climate change. Further, when climate change perceptions differ between the populace and governments, the communication of risk to the public becomes problematic. Finally, a public that is not aware of the issues surrounding climate change may resist or oppose climate change policies, which is of considerable importance to politicians and state leaders.&lt;ref name="LorenzoniAndPidgeon2006"&gt;{{cite journal | pages = 73–95 | issue = 1–2 | doi = 10.1007/s10584-006-9072-z | issn = 1573-1480 | format = Full free text | url = http://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/people/lev/ESSgc/lorenzoniPclimchng06.pdf | volume = 77 | journal = [[Climatic Change]] | first2 = N.

Public support for action to forestall global warming is as strong as public support has been historically for many other government actions; however, it is not "intense" in the sense that it overrides other priorities.&lt;ref name="LorenzoniAndPidgeon2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fix36-46&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roger Pielke, Jr.|authorlink1=Roger A.

A 2009 Eurobarometer survey found that, on the average, Europeans rate climate change as the second most serious problem facing the world today, between "poverty, the lack of food and drinking water" and "a major global economic downturn." 87% of Europeans consider climate change to be a "serious" or "very serious" problem, while 10% "do not consider it a serious problem." However, the proportion who believe it to be a problem has dropped in the period 2008/9 when the surveys were conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|TNS Opinion and Social|2009|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the small majority believe climate change is a serious threat, 55% percent believe the EU is doing too little and 30% believe the EU is going the right amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|TNS Opinion and Social|2009|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of European Union climate change perceptions, "climate change is an issue that has reached such a level of social and political acceptability across the EU that it enables (indeed, forces) the EU Commission and national leaders to produce all sorts of measures, including taxes."&lt;ref name="SchreursAndTiberghien2007" /&gt; Despite the persistent high level of personal involvement of European citizens, found in another Eurobarometer survey in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[[European Commission]], [http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_372_en.pdf Special Eurobarometer 372 – Climate Change] Brussels, June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; EU leaders have begun to downscale climate policy issues on the political agenda since the beginning of the Eurozone crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Geden (2012), [http://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/research_papers/2012_RP01_lpt_prt.pdf#page=19 The End of Climate Policy as We Knew it], SWP Research Paper 2012/RP01&lt;/ref&gt;

The proportion of Americans who believe that the effects of global warming have begun or will begin in a few years rose to a peak in 2008 where it then declined, and a similar trend was found regarding the belief that global warming is a threat to their lifestyle within their lifetime.&lt;ref name="Newman2010AmericanConcernDrop"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/126560/Americans-Global-Warming-Concerns-Continue-Drop.aspx|title=Americans' Global Warming Concerns Continue to Drop|first=Frank|last=Newport|date=11 Mar 2010|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=13 Mar 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concern over global warming often corresponds with economic downturns and national crisis such as 9/11 as Americans prioritize the economy and national security over environmental concerns.

[[File:Raster-scan Display.jpg|thumb|Raster-scan display sample]]

A '''raster scan''', or '''raster scanning''', is the rectangular pattern of image capture and reconstruction in television. By analogy, the term is used for [[raster graphics]], the pattern of image storage and transmission used in most computer [[bitmap]] image systems. The word ''[[wiktionary:raster|raster]]'' comes from the Latin word ''[[wiktionary:rastrum|rastrum]]'' (a rake), which is derived from ''[[wiktionary:radere|radere]]'' (to scrape); see  also [[rastrum]], an instrument for drawing musical [[staff lines]]. The pattern left by the lines of a rake, when drawn straight, resembles the parallel lines of a raster: this line-by-line scanning is what creates a raster. It is a systematic process of covering the area progressively, one line at a time. Although often a great deal faster, it is similar in the most-general sense to how one's gaze travels when one reads lines of text.

== Description ==

=== Scan lines ===
In a raster scan, an image is subdivided into a sequence of (usually horizontal) strips known as "scan lines". Each scan line can be transmitted in the form of an [[analog signal]] as it is read from the video source, as in television systems, or can be further divided into discrete [[pixels]] for processing in a computer system. This ordering of pixels by rows is known as raster order, or raster scan order. [[Analog television]] has discrete scan lines (discrete vertical resolution), but does ''not'' have discrete pixels (horizontal resolution) – it instead varies the signal continuously over the scan line. Thus, while the number of scan lines (vertical resolution) is unambiguously defined, the horizontal resolution is more approximate, according to how quickly the signal can change over the course of the scan line.

=== Scanning pattern ===
[[File:Raster-scan.svg|thumb|The beam position (sweeps) follow roughly a [[sawtooth wave]].]]
In raster scanning, the beam sweeps horizontally left-to-right at a steady rate, then blanks and rapidly moves back to the left, where it turns back on and sweeps out the next line. During this time, the vertical position is also steadily increasing (downward), but much more slowly – there is one vertical sweep per image frame, but one horizontal sweep per line of resolution. Thus each scan line is sloped slightly "downhill" (towards the lower right), with a slope of approximately –1/horizontal&amp;nbsp;resolution, while the sweep back to the left (retrace) is significantly faster than the forward scan, and essentially horizontal. The resulting tilt in the scan lines is very small, and is dwarfed in effect by screen convexity and other modest geometrical imperfections.

There is a misconception that once a scan line is complete, a [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] display in effect suddenly jumps internally, by analogy with a typewriter or printer's paper advance or [[line feed]], before creating the next scan line. As discussed above, this does not exactly happen: the vertical sweep continues at a steady rate over a scan line, creating a small tilt. Steady-rate sweep is done, instead of a stairstep of advancing every row, because steps are hard to implement technically, while steady-rate is much easier. The resulting tilt is compensated in most CRTs by the tilt and parallelogram adjustments, which impose a small vertical deflection as the beam sweeps across the screen. When properly adjusted, this deflection exactly cancels the downward slope of the scanlines. The horizontal retrace, in turn, slants smoothly downward as the tilt deflection is removed; there's no jump at either end of the retrace. In detail, scanning of CRTs is performed by magnetic deflection, by changing the current in the coils of the [[deflection yoke]]. Rapidly changing the deflection (a jump) requires a voltage spike to be applied to the yoke, and the deflection can only react as fast as the inductance and spike magnitude permit. Electronically, the inductance of the deflection yoke's vertical windings is relatively high, and thus the current in the yoke, and therefore the vertical part of the magnetic deflection field, can change only slowly.

In fact, spikes ''do'' occur, both horizontally and vertically, and the corresponding [[horizontal blanking interval]] and [[vertical blanking interval]] give the deflection currents [[settle time]] to retrace and settle to their new value. This happens during the blanking interval.

In electronics, these (usually steady-rate) movements of the beam[s] are called "sweeps", and the circuits that create the currents for the deflection yoke (or voltages for the horizontal deflection plates in an oscilloscope) are called the sweep circuits. These create a [[sawtooth wave]]: steady movement across the screen, then a typically rapid move back to the other side, and likewise for the vertical sweep. &lt;!-- "typically rapid": In some oscilloscopes, the retrace is much slower that the forward sweep for the fastest sweep speeds. --&gt; &lt;!-- Undershoot and ringing just about don't happen in sweep circuits. CRT horizontal sweeps are not amplifiers, and are highly nonlinear; if they were linear, their power consumption would be impractical. However, the horizontal flyback pulse becomes the accelerating voltage in the flyback transformer. Vertical sweeps for CRTs are linear amplifiers, however, and quite fast enough for the low frequencies involved. user Nikevich--&gt;

Furthermore, wide-deflection-angle CRTs need horizontal sweeps with current that changes proportionally faster toward the center, because the center of the screen is closer to the deflection yoke than the edges. A linear change in current would swing the beams at a constant rate angularly; this would cause horizontal compression toward the center.

=== Printers ===
Computer printers create their images basically by raster scanning. Laser printers use a spinning polygonal mirror (or an optical equivalent) to scan across the photosensitive drum, and paper movement provides the other scan axis. Considering typical printer resolution, the "downhill" effect is minuscule. Inkjet printers have multiple nozzles in their printheads, so many (dozens to hundreds) of "scan lines" are written together, and paper advance prepares for the next batch of scan lines. Transforming vector-based data into the form required by a display, or printer, requires a Raster Image Processor (RIP).

=== Fonts ===
Computer text is mostly created from font files that describe the outlines of each printable character or symbol (glyph). (A minority are "bit maps".) These outlines have to be converted into what are effectively little rasters, one per character, before being rendered (displayed or printed) as text, in effect merging their little rasters into that for the page.

== Video timing ==
In detail, each line (horizontal frame or HFrame) consists of:
* scanline, when beam is unblanked, and moving steadily to the right
* [[front porch]], when beam is blanked, and moving steadily to the right
* [[sync pulse]], when beam is blanked, and moves rapidly back to the left
* [[back porch]], when beam is blanked, and again moving steadily to the right.
The porches and associated blanking are to provide [[fall time]] and [[settle time]] for the beam to move back to the left (the voltage to decrease), and for [[ringing (signal)|ringing]] to die down. The vertical frame (VFrame) consists of exactly the same components, but only occurs once per image frame, and the times are considerably longer. The details of these intervals are called the '''video timing.''' See ''[http://www.epanorama.net/documents/vga2rgb/timings.html Video timing details revealed]'' for a diagram of these. These are mostly not visible to end users, but were visible in the case of [[XFree86 Modeline]]s, where users of [[XFree86]] could (and sometimes needed to) manually adjust these timings, particularly to achieve certain resolutions or [[refresh rate]]s.

==Perception==
Raster scan on CRTs produces both the impression of a steady image from a single scanning point (only one point is being drawn at a time) through several technical and psychological processes. These images then produce the impression of motion in largely the same way as film – a high enough [[frame rate]] of still images yields the impression of motion – though raster scans differ in a few respects, particularly interlacing.

Firstly, due to [[phosphor persistence]], even though only one "pixel" is being drawn at a time (recall that on an analog display, "pixel" is ill-defined, as there are no fixed horizontal divisions; rather, there is a "flying spot"), by the time the whole screen has been painted, the initial pixel is still relatively illuminated. Its brightness will have dropped some, which can cause a perception of [[flicker (screen)|flicker]]. This is one reason for the use of [[interlaced video|interlacing]] – since only every other line is drawn in a single field of broadcast video, the bright newly-drawn lines interlaced with the somewhat dimmed older drawn lines create relatively more even illumination.

Second, by [[persistence of vision]], the viewed image persists for a moment on the retina, and is perceived as relatively steady. By the related [[flicker fusion threshold]], these pulsating pixels appear steady.

These perceptually steady still images are then pieced together to produce a moving picture, similar to a [[movie projector]]. However, one must bear in mind that in film projectors, the full image is projected at once (not in a raster scan), uninterlaced, based on a frame rate of 24 frames per second. By contrast, a raster scanned interlaced video produces an image 50 or 60 fields per second (a field being every other line, thus corresponding to a frame rate of 25 or 30 frames per second), with each field being drawn a pixel at a time, rather than the entire image at once. These both produce a video, but yield somewhat different perceptions or "feel".

==Theory and history==
In a [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) display, when the electron beams are unblanked, the horizontal deflection component of the magnetic field created by the deflection yoke makes the beams scan "forward" from left to right at a constant rate. The data for consecutive pixels goes (at the pixel clock rate) to the digital-to-analog converters for each of the three primary colors. (For modern flat-panel displays, however, the pixel data remains digital.)  As the scan line is drawn, at the right edge of the display, all beams are blanked, but the magnetic field continues to increase in magnitude for a short while after blanking.

To clear up possible confusion: Referring to the magnetic deflection fields, if there were none, all beams would hit the screen near the center. The farther away from the center, the greater the strength of the field needed. Fields of one polarity move the beam up and left, and those of the opposite polarity move it down and right. At some point near the center, the magnetic deflection field is zero. So, therefore, a scan begins as the field decreases. Midway, it passes through zero, and smoothly increases again to complete the scan.

After one line has been created on the screen and the beams are blanked, the magnetic field reaches its designed maximum. Relative to the time required for a forward scan, it then changes back relatively quickly to what's required to position the beam beyond the left edge of the visible (unblanked) area. This process occurs with all beams blanked, and is called the retrace. At the left edge, the field steadily decreases in magnitude to start another forward scan, and soon after the start, the beams unblank to start a new visible scan line.

A similar process occurs for the vertical scan, but at the display refresh rate (typically 50 to 75&amp;nbsp;Hz). A complete field starts with a polarity that would place the beams beyond the top of the visible area, with the vertical component of the deflection field at maximum. After some tens of horizontal scans (but with the beams blanked), the vertical component of the unblank, combined with the horizontal unblank, permits the beams to show the first scan line. Once the last scan line is written, the vertical component of the magnetic field continues to increase by the equivalent of a few percent of the total height before the vertical retrace takes place. Vertical retrace is comparatively slow, occurring over a span of time required for several tens of horizontal scans. In analog CRT TVs, setting brightness to maximum typically made the vertical retrace visible as zigzag lines on the picture.

In analog TV, originally it was too costly to create a simple sequential raster scan of the type just described with a fast-enough refresh rate and sufficient horizontal resolution, although the French 819-line system had better definition than other standards of its time. To obtain a flicker-free display, analog TV used a variant of the scheme in moving-picture film projectors, in which each frame of the film is shown twice or three times. To do that, the shutter closes and opens again to increase the flicker rate, but not the data update rate.

===Interlaced scanning===
{{main|Interlaced video}}
To reduce [[flicker (screen)|flicker]], analog CRT TVs write only odd-numbered scan lines on the first vertical scan; then, the even-numbered lines follow, placed ("interlaced") between the odd-numbered lines. This is called [[interlaced scanning]]. (In this case, positioning the even-numbered lines does require precise position control; in old analog TVs, trimming the Vertical Hold adjustment made scan lines space properly. If slightly misadjusted, the scan lines would appear in pairs, with spaces between.) Modern high-definition TV displays use data formats like progressive scan in computer monitors (such as "1080p", 1080 lines, progressive), or interlaced (such as "1080i").

=== Radar ===
Raster scans have been used in (naval gun) fire-control radar, although they were typically narrow rectangles. They were used in pairs (for bearing, and for elevation). In each display, one axis was angular offset from the line of sight, and the other, range. Radar returns brightened the video. Search and weather radars have a circular display (Plan Position Indicator, PPI) that covers a round screen, but this is not technically a raster. Analog PPIs have sweeps that move outward from the center, and the angle of the sweep matches antenna rotation, up being north, or the bow of the ship.

== History ==
{{further|History of television}}
The use of raster scanning in television was proposed in 1880 by French engineer [[Maurice Leblanc (engineer)|Maurice Leblanc]].&lt;ref&gt;
Leblanc, Maurice, "Etude sur la transmission électrique des impressions lumineuses" (Study on electrical transmission of luminous impressions), ''La Lumière électrique'' (Electric light), December 1, 1880&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of raster scanning was inherent in the original mechanical [[Nipkow disk|disc-scanning]] television patent of [[Paul Nipkow]] in 1884. The term ''raster'' was used for a halftone printing screen pattern as early as 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Half-Tone Photo-Engraving | journal = The Photographic Times | volume = 25 | pages = 121–123 | publisher = Scoville Manufacturing Co. | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=M7caAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=raster+halftone+date:0-1895 | year = 1894 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar terminology was used in German at least from 1897; Eder&lt;ref&gt;Josef Maria Eder, ''Ausführliches Handbuch der Photographie'' Halle: Druck und Verlag von Wilhelm Knapp, 1897&lt;/ref&gt; writes of "die Herstellung von Rasternegativen für Zwecke der Autotypie" (the production of raster negatives for halftones). Max Dieckmann and Gustav Glage were the first to produce actual raster images on a cathode-ray tube (CRT); they patented their techniques in Germany in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Early Television: A Bibliographic Guide to 1940 | author = George Shiers and May Shiers | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | isbn = 0-8240-7782-2 | page = 47 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OlXsZdT8HUQC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=Dieckmann+Glage+1906+raster | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has not been determined whether they used the word ''raster'' in their patent or other writings.

An early use of the term ''raster'' with respect to image scanning via a rotating drum is Arthur Korn's 1907 book which says (in German):&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Korn, ''Elektrisches Fernphotograhie und Ähnliches'', Leipzig: Verl. v. S. Hirzel, 1907&lt;/ref&gt; "...als Rasterbild auf Metall in solcher Weise aufgetragen, dass die hellen Töne metallisch rein sind, oder umgekehrt" (...as a raster image laid out on metal in such way that the bright tones are metallically pure, and vice versa).  Korn was applying the terminology and techniques of [[halftone]] printing, where a "Rasterbild" was a halftone-screened printing plate.There were more scanning-relevant uses of ''Raster'' by German authors Eichhorn in 1926:&lt;ref&gt;Gustav Eichhorn, ''Wetterfunk Bildfunk Television (Drahtloses Fernsehen)'', Zürich: Teubner, 1926&lt;/ref&gt; "die Tönung der Bildelemente bei diesen Rasterbildern" and "Die Bildpunkte des Rasterbildes" ("the tone of the picture elements of this raster image" and "the picture points of the raster image"); and Schröter in 1932:&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Schröter, ''Handbuch der Bildtelegraphie und des Fernsehens'', Berlin: Verl. v. Julius Springer, 1932&lt;/ref&gt; "Rasterelementen," "Rasterzahl," and "Zellenraster"  ("raster elements," "raster count," and "cell raster").

The first use of ''raster'' specifically for a television scanning pattern is often credited to Baron Manfred von Ardenne who wrote in 1933:&lt;ref&gt;Manfred von Ardenne, ''Die Kathodenstrahlröhre und ihre Anwendung in der Schwachstromtechnik'', Berlin: Verl. v. Julius Springer, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; "In einem Vortrag im Januar 1930 konnte durch Vorführungen nachgewiesen werden, daß die Braunsche Röhre hinsichtlich Punktschärfe und Punkthelligkeit zur Herstellung eines präzisen, lichtstarken Rasters laboratoriumsmäßig durchgebildet war" (In a lecture in January 1930 it was proven by demonstrations that the Braun tube was prototyped in the laboratory with point sharpness and point brightness for the production of a precise, bright raster). ''Raster'' was adopted into English television literature at least by 1936, in the title of an article in ''Electrician''.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, L. E. C., "Telecommunications XX-IV: The Raster," ''Electrician'' 116 (Mar. 13):351–352, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematical theory of image scanning was developed in detail using [[Fourier transform]] techniques in a classic paper by Mertz and Gray of Bell Labs in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Mertz and Frank Gray, "A Theory of Scanning and Its Relation to the Characteristics of the Transmitted Signal in Telephotography and Television," ''Bell System Technical Journal'', Vol. 13, pp. 464-515, July, 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''SUNY-ESF Ranger School''' (formerly the '''New York State Ranger School'''), on the east branch of the [[Oswegatchie River]] near [[Wanakena, New York]], offers [[Associate degree#United States|A.A.S.]] degrees in forest and natural resources management. Established in 1912, the school is affiliated with the [[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry]] (SUNY-ESF). The Ranger School commemorated its centennial in 2012-13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/communications/view.asp?newsID=1854 "Ranger School Celebrates Its 100th," SUNY-ESF, August 6, 2012.] Accessed: August 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==

The Ranger School is situated in the northwestern part of the [[Adirondack Park]], on the east branch of the scenic Oswegatchie River, which flows into [[Cranberry Lake]]. The campus is about {{convert|65|mi|km}} from [[Watertown, New York]] and {{convert|35|mi|km}} from [[Tupper Lake (village), New York|Tupper Lake]].

==History==
The New York State Ranger School was founded in 1912, under the administration of the [[History of the New York State College of Forestry|New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University]], to train [[forest ranger]]s and other personnel for the still-young Adirondack Park.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Eugene S. Whitmore, the Ranger School's first graduate, completed his studies the same year that school was founded, in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;SUNY-ESF. 2008. ''Alumni Directory. 100th Anniversary Edition''. Syracuse, NY, p. 455.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 3000 students have completed their degrees at the Ranger School since it opened.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The Ranger School celebrated its centennial anniversary in 2012-13.&lt;ref name=wdt&gt;[http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20120512/NEWS05/705129917 Ellen, Martha. 2012.

''Louis Marshall: Champion of Liberty. Selected Papers and Addresses''. Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, p. 1123.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In 1923, Governor [[Al Smith|Alfred E. Smith]], later to become President of the Board of Trustees of the New York State College of Forestry, signed an appropriation bill for the construction of the Ranger School's new building; the structure was dedicated in 1928. 
* The [[International Paper Company]] added to the school's properties with a gift of {{convert|500|acre|km2}}, in 1929.&lt;ref name=rez /&gt;

==Today==
Today, the Ranger School is a unit of the SUNY-ESF. Michael Bridgen, Professor of Forest and Natural Resources Management, is director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/rangerschool/directory/ "Ranger School Directory,"] SUNY-ESF Ranger School. Accessed: July 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

After "spending a year at a college of their choice,"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; students spend an academic year or summer at the residential school, studying [[forestry|forest technology]], [[surveying]], or environmental and [[natural resource management|natural resources conservation]], earning an [[Associate of Applied Science]] (A.A.S.) degree upon completion. Students can continue their studies at the main ESF campus, in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], to earn a bachelor's degree.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; 

In addition to classrooms, offices, dormitory and kitchen facilities, the school's properties also include the {{convert|3000|acre|km2|adj=on}}, [[James F.

{{marketing}}
'''Social marketing''' is the use of marketing theory, skills and practices to achieve social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/social-marketing.html|title=What is social marketing? definition and meaning|website=BusinessDictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the primary goal of achieving "[[Common good|social good]]". Traditional [[commercial marketing]] aims are primarily financial, though they can have positive social affects as well. In the context of public health, social marketing would promote general health, raise awareness and induce changes in behaviour. To see social marketing as only the use of standard commercial marketing practices to achieve non-commercial goals is an [[oversimplification|oversimplified view]].  

Social marketing seeks to develop and integrate [[marketing]] concepts with other approaches to [[social change]]. Social marketing aims to influence behaviors that benefit individuals and communities for the greater social good. The goal is to deliver competition-sensitive and segmented social change programs that are effective, efficient, equitable and sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authors=International Social Marketing Association, European Social Marketing Association &amp; Australian Association of Social Marketing|year=2013|title=Consensus Definition of Social Marketing|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Increasingly, social marketing is described as having "two parents." The "social parent" uses [[social science]] and [[social policy]] approaches. The "marketing parent" uses commercial and public sector [[marketing]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Truss|first=Aiden|title=Social Marketing and Public Health: Theory and practice|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CsEijRnC8GYC|editor=Jeff French |editor2=Clive Blair-Stevens |editor3=Dominic McVey |editor4=Rowena Merritt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent years have also witnessed a broader focus.  Social marketing now goes beyond influencing individual behaviour. It promotes socio-cultural and structural change relevant to social issues.&lt;ref name="Strategic Social Marketing"&gt;{{cite book|last1=French|first1=Jeff|last2=Gordon|first2=Ross|title=Strategic Social Marketing|date=2015|publisher=Sage|isbn=9781446248621|url=https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/strategic-social-marketing/book237965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, social marketing scholars are beginning to advocate for a broader definition of social marketing: "social marketing is the application of marketing principles to enable individual and collective ideas and actions in the pursuit of effective, efficient, equitable, fair and sustained social transformation".
The new emphasis gives equal weight to the effects (efficiency and effectiveness) and the process (equity, fairness and sustainability) of social marketing programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Saunders, S. G.|author2=Barrington, D. J.|author3=Sridharan, S.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2015|title=Redefining social marketing: beyond behavioural change|journal=Journal of Social Marketing|volume=5|issue=2|pages=160–168|doi=10.1108/JSOCM-03-2014-0021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications ==
The first documented evidence of the deliberate use of marketing to address a social issue comes from a 1963 [[reproductive health]] program led by [[K. T. Chandy]] at the Indian Institute of Management in Calcutta, India.  Chandy and colleagues proposed, and subsequently implemented, a national [[family planning]] program with high quality, government brand condoms distributed and sold throughout the country at low cost. The program included an integrated consumer marketing campaign run with active point of sale promotion. Retailers were trained to sell the product aggressively, and a new organization was created to implement the program.&lt;ref&gt;Chandy, K.T., Balakrishman, T.R., Kantawalla, J.M., Mohan, K., Sen, N.P., Gupta, S.S. &amp; Srivastva, S. (1965). Proposals for family planning promotion: A marketing plan. Studies in Family Planning;1(6):7-12.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Developing country|developing countries]], the use of social marketing expanded to [[Prevention of HIV/AIDS|HIV prevention]], control of childhood [[diarrhea]] (through the use of [[Oral rehydration therapy|oral re-hydration therapies]]), [[malaria]] control and treatment, [[Portable water purification|point-of-use water treatment]], [[Self-supply of water and sanitation|on-site sanitation]] methods and the provision of basic health services.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, R. C. (2011). An integrative model for social marketing. Journal of Social Marketing;1:54–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health promotion campaigns began applying social marketing in practice in the 1980s. In the United States, The National High Blood Pressure Education Program&lt;ref&gt;Roccella, E.J. &amp; Ward, G.W. (1984). The National High Blood Pressure Education Program: A description of its utility as a generic program model. Health Education Quarterly, 11(3): 225-242&lt;/ref&gt; and the community heart disease prevention studies in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and at Stanford University&lt;ref name="Lefebvre1988"&gt;Lefebvre, R.C. &amp; Flora, J.A. (1988). Social Marketing and Public Health Intervention (Portable Document Format). Health Education Quarterly; 15 (3): 300, 301.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach to address population-based risk factor behaviour change. Notable early developments also took place in Australia. These included the Victoria Cancer Council developing its [[smoking cessation|anti-tobacco]] campaign "Quit" (1988) and "SunSmart" (1988), its campaign against [[skin cancer]] which had the slogan "[[Slip-Slop-Slap|Slip! Slop! Slap!]]"&lt;ref name="VicHealth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/en/About-VicHealth/VicHealth-History-Major-Events-and-Milestones.aspx |title=VicHealth History: Major Events and Milestones |work=VicHealth |publisher=Victorian Health Promotion Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719032451/http://www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/en/About-VicHealth/VicHealth-History-Major-Events-and-Milestones.aspx |archivedate=2009-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, the field has rapidly expanded around the world to include active living communities, disaster preparedness and response, [[ecosystem]] and species conservation, environmental issues, development of volunteer or indigenous workforces, financial literacy, global threats of [[Antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistance]], government corruption, improving the quality of health care, injury prevention, landowner education, [[marine conservation]] and ocean sustainability, patient-centered health care, reducing health disparities, [[sustainable consumption]], transportation demand management, [[water treatment]] and [[sanitation]] systems and youth gambling problems, among other social needs (See&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, R.C. (2013) Social marketing and social change: Strategies and tools for improving health, well-being and the environment. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lefebvre, R.C. 2013"&gt;Lefebvre, R.C. (Ed). Social marketing: Six volume set. London: SAGE Publications, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;).

On a wider front, by 2007, government in the United Kingdom announced the development of its first social marketing strategy for all aspects of health.&lt;ref name="DeptofHealth2004"&gt;UK Department of Health, ''[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4094550 Choosing Health: Making Healthy Choices Easier]'', Cmd.6374 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the US national health objectives&lt;ref name="HealthyPeople2020"&gt;US Department of Health and Human Services, ''[http://healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/objectiveslist.aspx?topicId=18 Health Communication and Health Information Technology]''&lt;/ref&gt; included increasing the number of state health departments that report using social marketing in health promotion and disease prevention programs and increasing the number of schools of public health that offer courses and workforce development activities in social marketing.

Two other public health applications include the CDC's CDCynergy training and software application&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthmarketing/cdcynergy/ |title=CDC - CDCynergy (NCHM) |accessdate=2007-10-19 |date=2006-06-27 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SMART (Social Marketing and Assessment Response Tool) in the U.S.&lt;ref name="SMART"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CTG/is_2-3_18/ai_108194963/ |title=Positioning Social Marketing as a Planning Process for Health Education |accessdate=2012-01-13 |last= Neiger |first=Brad L. |author2=Rosemary Thackeray |author3=Michael D. Barnes |author4= James F. McKenzie  |year=2003 |journal=American Journal of Health Studies |volume=18 |issue=2/3 |pages=75–81 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social marketing theory and practice has been progressed in several countries such as the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the UK, and in the latter a number of key government policy papers have adopted a strategic social marketing approach. Publications such as "Choosing Health" in 2004,&lt;ref name="DeptofHealth2004"/&gt; "[http://www.nsmcentre.org.uk/component/remository/NSMC-Publications/Its-Our-Health-%28Summary-Report%29/ It's our health!]" in 2006 and "[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4139514 Health Challenge England]" in 2006, represent steps to achieve a strategic and operational use of social marketing. In India, [[AIDS]] controlling programs are largely using social marketing and social workers are largely working for it. Most of the social workers are professionally trained for this task.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

A variation of social marketing has emerged as a systematic way to foster more sustainable behavior. Referred to as community-based social marketing (CBSM) by Canadian environmental psychologist Doug McKenzie-Mohr, CBSM strives to change the behavior of communities to reduce their impact on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie-Mohr, D. (2000). Fostering sustainable behavior through community-based social marketing. American Psychologist, 55(5), 531-537.&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing that simply providing information is usually not sufficient to initiate behavior change, CBSM uses tools and findings from social psychology to discover the perceived barriers to behavior change and ways of overcoming these barriers. Among the tools and techniques used by CBSM are focus groups and surveys (to discover barriers) and commitments, prompts, social norms, social diffusion, feedback and incentives (to change behavior). The tools of CBSM have been used to foster sustainable behavior in many areas, including energy conservation,&lt;ref&gt;Schultz P. W., Nolan J. M., Cialdini R. B., Goldstein N. J., Griskevicius Vladas (2007). The Constructive, Destructive, and Reconstructive Power of Social Norms. ''Psychological Science'', 18(5), 429-434.&lt;/ref&gt; environmental regulation&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, A. (2010). Using Community-Based Social Marketing Techniques to Enhance Environmental Regulation. ''Sustainability'', 2(4), 1138-1160&lt;/ref&gt; and recycling.&lt;ref&gt;Haldeman, T. &amp; Turner, J. (2009). Implementing a community-based social marketing program to increase recycling. ''Social Marketing Quarterly'', 15(3), 114-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the concept of strategic social marketing has emerged, which identifies that social change requires action at the individual, community, socio-cultural, political and environmental level, and that social marketing can and should influence policy, strategy and operational tactics to achieve pro-social outcomes.&lt;ref name="Strategic Social Marketing"/&gt;

Other social marketing can be aimed at products deemed, at least by proponents, as socially unacceptable. One of the most notable is [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) which for many years has waged social marketing campaigns against the use of natural fur products. The campaigns' efficacy has been subject to dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peek|first=Liz|title=Warm Weather Torments City Furriers|url=http://www.nysun.com/business/warm-weather-torments-city-furriers/43889/|accessdate=12 March 2013|newspaper=New York Sun|date=November 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all social marketing campaigns are effective everywhere. For example, anti-smoking campaigns such as [[World No Tobacco Day]] while being successful (in concert with government tobacco controls) in curbing the demand for tobacco products in North America and in parts of Europe, have been less effective in other parts of the world such as China, India and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Fedyashin, [Opinion &amp; Analysis: World No Tobacco Day, Futile Attempt to Curb Smoking. http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20090529/155119204.html], RiaNovosti (Russia), May 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; (See also: [[Prevalence of tobacco consumption]])

Social marketing uses the benefits of doing social good to secure and maintain [[customer engagement]]. In social marketing the distinguishing feature is therefore its "primary focus on social good, and it is not a secondary outcome.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Not all public sector and not-for-profit marketing is social marketing.

Public sector bodies can use standard marketing approaches to improve the promotion of their relevant services and organizational aims. This can be very important but should not be confused with social marketing where the focus is on achieving specific behavioral goals with specific audiences in relation to topics relevant to social good (e.g., health, sustainability, recycling, etc.). For example, a 3-month marketing campaign to encourage people to get a H1N1 vaccine is more tactical in nature and should not be considered social marketing. A campaign that promotes and reminds people to get regular check-ups and all of their vaccinations when they're supposed to encourages a long-term behavior change that benefits society. It can therefore be considered social marketing.

Social marketing can be confused with commercial marketing. A commercial marketer may only seek to influence a buyer to purchase a product. Social marketers have more difficult goals.  They want to make potentially difficult and long-term behavior changes in target populations, which may or may not involve purchasing a product.  For example, reducing cigarette smoking or encouraging use of condoms have difficult challenges to overcome that go beyond purchasing decisions.

Social marketing is sometimes seen as being restricted to a client base of non-profit organizations, health services groups, the government agency. However, the goal of inducing social change is not restricted to this narrow spectrum of organizations. Corporations, for example, can be clients.  Public relations or social responsibility departments may champion social causes such funding for the arts, which would involve social marketing.

Social marketing should not be confused with the societal marketing concept which was a forerunner of [[sustainable marketing]] in integrating issues of [[corporate social responsibility|social responsibility]] into commercial marketing strategies. In contrast to that, social marketing uses commercial marketing theories, tools and techniques to social issues.

Social marketing applies a "customer oriented" approach and uses the concepts and tools used by commercial marketers in pursuit of social goals like anti-smoking campaigns or fund raising for NGOs.

Social marketers must create competitive advantage by constantly adapting to and instigating change. With climate change in mind, adaptations to market changes are likely to be more successful if actions are guided by knowledge of the forces shaping market behaviours and insights that enable the development of sustainable competitive advantages.&lt;ref&gt;Shocker, Allan D., Rajendra K. Srivastava, and Robert W. Ruekert. "Challenges and Opportunities Facing Brand Management: An Introduction to the Special Issue." Journal of Marketing Research 31.2 (1994): 149. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Jupitermedia]] announced its "Social Marketing" service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://socialmarketing.blogs.com/r_craiig_lefebvres_social/2006/08/hello_jupiter_a.html |title=Hello Jupiter? Anyone Home? |accessdate=2006-09-01 |last=Lefebvre |first=R. Craig |date=2006-08-30 |work=On Marketing and Social Change}}&lt;/ref&gt; with which it aims to enable website owners to profit from [[social media]]. Despite protests from the social marketing communities over the perceived hijacking of the term, Jupiter stuck with the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://weblogs.jupiterresearch.com/analysts/schatsky/archives/016969.html |title=Social Marketing vs. Social Marketing |accessdate=2006-09-01 |last=Schatsky |first=David |date=2006-09-01 |work=Jupiterresearch Analyst Weblogs |publisher=Jupitermedia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303050738/http://weblogs.jupiterresearch.com/analysts/schatsky/archives/016969.html |archivedate=2007-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jupiter's approach is more correctly (and commonly) referred to as [[social media optimization]].

==History ==

Many scholars ascribe the beginning of the field of social marketing to an article published by G.D. Wiebe in the Winter 1951-1952 edition of ''[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wiebe|first=G.D.|title=Merchandising Commodities and Citizenship on Television|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1951–1952|volume=15|issue=Winter|pages=679|doi=10.1086/266353}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Wiebe posed a rhetorical question: "Why can’t you sell brotherhood and rational thinking like you can sell soap?” He then went on to discuss what he saw as the challenges of attempting to sell a social good as if it were a commodity, thus identifying social marketing (though he did not label it as such) as a discipline unique from c
mmodity marketing. Yet, Wilkie &amp; Moore (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Wilkie, W. L., &amp; Moore, E. S. (2003). Scholarly research in marketing: Exploring the “4 eras” of thought development. Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing; 22(2):116–146.&lt;/ref&gt; note that the marketing discipline has been involved with questions about the intersection of marketing and society since its earliest days as a discipline.

A decade later, organizations such as the [[KfW Entwicklungsbank]] in Germany, the Canadian International Development Agency, the Ministry for
Foreign Affairs in The Netherlands, UK Department for International Development, [[US Agency for International Development]], [[World Health Organization]] and the [[World Bank]] began sponsoring social marketing interventions to improve family planning and achieve other social goals in Africa, Sri Lanka, and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Michael|title=The Marketing Book|year=2012|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Oxford|pages=696}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lefebvre|first=R. Craig|title=Social Marketing and Social Change: Strategies and Tools to Improve Health, Well-Being and the Environment\year=2013|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next milestone in the evolution of social marketing was the publication of "Social Marketing: An Approach to Planned Social Change" in the ''[[Journal of Marketing]]'' by [[Philip Kotler]] and [[Gerald Zaltman]].&lt;ref name="Kotler 1971"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kotler|first=Philip|author2=Gerald Zaltman |title=Social Marketing: An Approach to Planned Social Change|journal=Journal of Marketing|date=July 1971|volume=35|pages=3–12|url=https://www.sfu.ca/cmns/faculty/laba_m/425/07-fall/documents/Kotler-Zaltman.PDF|doi=10.2307/1249783}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kotler and Zaltman coined the term 'social marketing' and defined it as "the design, implementation, and control of programs calculated to influence the acceptability of social ideas and involving considerations of product planning, pricing, communication, distribution, and marketing research." They conclude that "social marketing appears to represent a bridging mechanism which links the behavior scientist's knowledge of human behavior with the socially useful implementation of what that knowledge allows."

Craig Lefebvre and June Flora introduced social marketing to the public health community in 1988,&lt;ref name="Lefebvre1988"/&gt; where it has been most widely used and explored. They noted that there was a need for "large scale, broad-based, behavior change focused programs" to improve public health (the community wide prevention of cardiovascular diseases in their respective projects) and outlined eight essential components of social marketing that still hold today:
#A consumer orientation to realize organizational (social) goals
#An emphasis on the voluntary exchanges of goods and services between providers and consumers
#Research in audience analysis and segmentation strategies
#The use of formative research in product and message design and the pretesting of these materials
#An analysis of distribution (or communication) channels
#Use of the [[marketing mix]]—using and blending product, price, place and promotion characteristics in intervention planning and implementation
#A process tracking system with both integrative and control functions
#A management process that involves problem analysis, planning, implementation and feedback functions&lt;ref name="Lefebvre"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lefebvre |first=R. Craig |author2=June A. Flora  |year=1988 |title=Social Marketing and Public Health Intervention |journal=Health Education Quarterly |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=300, 301 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |url=http://socialmarketing.blogs.com/Publications/Social_Marketing_and_Public_Health_Intervention.pdf |format=Portable Document Format |accessdate=2008-04-30 |doi=10.1177/109019818801500305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking of what they termed "social change campaigns", Kotler and [[Ned Roberto]] introduced the subject by writing, "A social change campaign is an organized effort conducted by one group (the change agent) which attempts to persuade others (the target adopters) to accept, modify, or abandon certain ideas, attitudes, practices or behavior." Their 1989 text was updated in 2002 by [[Philip Kotler]], [[Ned Roberto]] and Nancy Lee.&lt;ref name="Kotler2002"&gt;Kotler, Philip, Ned Roberto and Nancy Lee. ''Social Marketing: Improving the Quality of Life'', SAGE, 2002. ({{ISBN|0-7619-2434-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[University of Stirling]] was the first university to open a dedicated research institute to Social Marketing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ism.stir.ac.uk/|title=Institute for Social Marketing – University of Stirling|author=|date=|website=www.ism.stir.ac.uk|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 2007, [[Middlesex University]] became the first university to offer a specialized [[postgraduate]] programme in Health &amp; Social Marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Source: {{cite web|url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/marketing/health_soc_marketing_ma.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524003618/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/marketing/health_soc_marketing_ma.aspx |archivedate=2010-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years there has been an important development to distinguish between "strategic social marketing" and "operational social marketing".

Much of the literature and case examples focus on operational social marketing, using it to achieve specific behavioral goals in relation to different audiences and topics. However, there has been increasing efforts to ensure social marketing goes "upstream" and is used much more strategically to inform policy formulation and strategy development. Here the focus is less on specific audience and topic work but uses strong customer understanding and insight to inform and guide effective policy and strategy development.

Social marketing is also being explored as a method for social innovation, a framework to increase the adoption of evidence-based practices among professionals and organizations, and as a core skill for public sector managers and social entrepreneurs. It is being viewed as an approach to design more effective, efficient, equitable and sustainable approaches to enhance social well-being that extends beyond individual behavior change to include creating positive shifts in social networks and social norms, businesses, markets and public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, R.C. (2013). Social marketing and social change: Strategies and tools for improving health, well-being and the environment. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many examples exist of social marketing research, with over 120 papers compiled in a six volume set.&lt;ref name="Lefebvre, R.C. 2013"/&gt;). For example, research now shows ways to reduce the intentions of people to binge drink or engage in dangerous driving. Martin, Lee, Weeks and Kaya (2013) suggests that understanding consumer personality and how people view others is important. People were shown ads talking of the harmful effects of binge drinking. People who valued close friends as a sense of who they are were less likely to want to binge drink after seeing an ad featuring them and a close friend. People who were loners or who did not see close friends important to their sense of who they were reacted better to ads featuring an individual. A similar pattern was shown for ads showing a person driving at dangerous speeds. This suggests ads showing potential harm to citizens from binge drinking or dangerous driving are less effective than ads highlighting a person’s close friends.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Brett A. S., Christina K.C. Lee, Clinton Weeks and Maria Kaya (2013), [http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Martin-et-al.-2013.pdf "How to stop binge drinking and speeding motorists: Effects of relational-interdependent self-construable and self-referencing on attitudes toward social marketing "] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427160914/http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Martin-et-al.-2013.pdf |date=2015-04-27 }}, ''Journal of Consumer Behavior'', 12, 81-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spaced Learning''' is a learning method in which highly condensed learning content is repeated three times, with two 10-minute breaks during which distractor activities such as physical activities are performed by the students.  It is based on the temporal pattern of stimuli for creating long-term memories reported by R. Douglas Fields in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=R.Douglas Fields|title=Making Memories Stick|publisher=[[Scientific American]]|date=February 2005|pages=58–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This 'temporal code' Fields used in his experiments was developed into a learning method for creating long-term memories by Paul Kelley, who led a team of teachers and scientists as reported in ''Making Minds''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Paul Kelley|title=Making Minds: What's wrong with education- and what should we do about it?|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-41411-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008.

A paper on the method has been published in ''Frontiers in Human Neuroscience''.&lt;ref&gt;''Frontiers in Human Neuroscience&lt;http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00589/abstract''&lt;/ref&gt;  This makes a substantial scientific case for this approach to learning based on research over many years in different species.  The distinctive features of the approach are made clear: the speed of instruction being minutes (as opposed to hours, days or months), the spaces and their function, and why content is repeated three times. Spaced learning has been reported in other species as being required for long-term memory creation, a finding that gives considerable weight to its use in education.

== Background ==
Spaced Learning had been developed by Kelley and his team over years and rather confusingly was not called 'Spaced Learning' at first.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|title=A sixth of a GCSE in 60 minutes?|author=Patrick Barkham|date=13 Feb 2009|pages=G2 4–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Earlier descriptions of Spaced Learning often led to its being misunderstood, and the scientific origins of the approach ignored. When the initial reports of outcomes were made public, media seized upon the condensed learning content as the key element in the approach used and the BBC national television news, ''The Sunday Times, The Independent,'' and ''The Economist''&lt;ref&gt;''The Sunday Times'', 15 July 2007;''The Independent'', 15 September 2007; and ''The Economist'', 2 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; reported the approach largely in those terms ('8 minute lessons'). This emphasis was misplaced, since Spaced Learning as a method depends on the length and number of the spaces (Fields' 'temporal code'), not the content presentation (which can vary).  However, this misunderstanding was also included in reports in the educational press, notably ''The Times Educational Supplement''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Educational Supplement'', 29 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The description of the approach as 'Spaced Learning', clarifying the importance of the spaces, only appeared later.  Additional research reported in ''The Times Educational Supplement'', ''The Guardian'', ''The Times'', and ''The Daily Telegraph'' on 30 January 2009 reported that Spaced Learning successfully prepared students for a national examination in less than two hours with no traditional teaching at all.

The use of the term 'spaced' reflects the distinction in other research between 'spaced training' and 'massed training' where there have been conflicting results reported (for example, see [[spaced repetition]]). [[Spaced retrieval]] practice- trying to recover long-term memories quickly and accurately- is the subject of a different line of research but also shows that spaced practice (for example, taking a practice test every month) is more effective that massed practice.

The significance of Spaced Learning may prove important in different ways:
#as a demonstration that neuroscience is now producing outcomes that can be directly implemented in education- as asserted by Kelley.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kelley, ''Making Minds: What's wrong with education- and what should we do about it?'', Routledge, London / New York,150-4&lt;/ref&gt;  This seems established now through the academic paper in ''Frontiers in Human Neuroscience''
#as a demonstration that primary neuroscientific research can demonstrate processes that have not been used in formal education, yet are of fundamental importance in the learning process

During [[heterosexual]] [[anal sex]], splash conception occurs when [[semen]] containing [[spermatozoon|sperm]] migrates from the [[anus]], across the [[perineum]], to the [[labia (genitalia)|labia]], and subsequently into the [[vagina]], causing the fertilization of an [[ovum]] followed by [[Conception (biology)|conception]] or [[pregnancy]].  This migration does not occur by virtue of the spermatozoa's tail propulsion, but rather due to gravity or other kinetic forces (such as that of a penis pulling out of an anus and dragging semen left on the tip, or being expelled from the anus due to said penis's recent ejaculation, across the perineum and onto the labia.

'''Sustainability measurement''' is the quantitative basis for the informed management of [[sustainability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accaglobal.com/publicinterest/activities/research/reports/sustainable_and_transparent/rr-078 |title=Sustainability Accounting in UK Local Government |publisher=The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants |accessdate=2008-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411231334/http://www.accaglobal.com/publicinterest/activities/research/reports/sustainable_and_transparent/rr-078 |archivedate=2008-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The metrics used for the measurement of sustainability (involving the sustainability of environmental, social and economic domains, both individually and in various combinations) are still evolving: they include [[Ecological indicator|indicator]]s, benchmarks, audits, indexes and accounting,  as well as assessment, appraisal&lt;ref&gt;Dalal-Clayton, Barry and Sadler, Barry 2009. ''Sustainability Appraisal. A Sourcebook and Reference Guide to International Experience.'' London: Earthscan. {{ISBN|978-1-84407-357-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and other reporting systems. They are applied over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.&lt;ref&gt;Hak, T. et al. 2007. ''Sustainability Indicators'', SCOPE 67. Island Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Simon  and Morse, Stephen 2008. ''Sustainability Indicators. Measuring the Immeasurable?'' 2nd edn. London: Earthscan. {{ISBN|978-1-84407-299-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the best known and most widely used sustainability measures include corporate [[sustainability reporting]], [[Triple bottom line|Triple Bottom Line accounting]], and estimates of the quality of sustainability governance for individual countries using the [[Environmental Sustainability Index]] and [[Environmental Performance Index]]. An alternative approach, used by the [[United Nations Global Compact]] Cities Programme and explicitly critical of the triple-bottom-line approach is [[Circles of Sustainability]].

==Sustainability indicators and their function==
The principal objective of sustainability indicators is to inform public policy-making as part of the process of [[sustainability governance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul-Marie Boulanger |url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index166.html |title=Boulanger, P. M. (2008) "Sustainable development indicators: a scientific challenge, a democratic issue". '&amp;#39;S.A.P.I.EN.S.'&amp;#39; '&amp;#39;'1'&amp;#39;' (1) |publisher=Sapiens.revues.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sustainability indicators can provide information on any aspect of the interplay between the environment and socio-economic activities.&lt;ref&gt;Hak, T., Moldan, B. &amp; Dahl, A.L. 2007. SCOPE 67. ''Sustainability indicators''. Island Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Building strategic indicator sets generally deals with just a few simple questions: what is happening? (descriptive indicators), does it matter and are we reaching targets? (performance indicators), are we improving? (efficiency indicators), are measures working? (policy effectiveness indicators), and are we generally better off? (total welfare indicators). One popular general framework used by The [[European Environment Agency]] uses a slight modification of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] [[DPSIR]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Stanners, D. et al. 2007. ''Frameworks for environmental assessment and indicators at the EEA.'' In: Hak, T., Moldan, B. &amp; Dahl, A.L. 2007. SCOPE 67. ''Sustainability indicators''. Island Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt; This breaks up environmental impact into five stages. Social and economic developments (consumption and production) ''(D)rive'' or initiate environmental ''(P)ressures'' which, in turn, produces a change in the ''(S)tate'' of the environment which leads to ''(I)mpacts'' of various kinds. Societal ''(R)esponses'' (policy guided by sustainability indicators) can be introduced at any stage of this sequence of events.

==Metrics at the global scale==

===United Nations Indicators===
The United Nations has developed extensive sustainability measurement  tools in relation to sustainable development &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/natlinfo/indicators/isd.htm] United Nations sustainable development indicators&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a [[System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/seea.asp], [[International Standard Industrial Classification]] UN System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benchmarks, indicators, indexes, auditing etc.===
In the last couple of decades there has arisen a crowded toolbox of quantitative methods used to assess sustainability — including measures of resource use like [[life cycle assessment]], measures of consumption like the [[ecological footprint]] and measurements of quality of environmental governance like the [[Environmental Performance Index]]. The following is a list of quantitative "tools" used by sustainability scientists - the different categories are for convenience only as defining criteria will intergrade. It would be too difficult to list all those methods available at different levels of organisation so those listed here are at for the global level only.

===Resource metrics===
Part of this process can relate to resource use such as [[energy accounting]] or to economic metrics or [[price system]] values as compared to [[non-market economics]] potential, for understanding resource use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Net_energy_analysis |title=Net energy analysis |publisher=Eoearth.org |date=2010-07-23 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An important task for resource theory ([[energy economics]]) is to develop methods to optimize resource conversion processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |title=Environmental Decision Making, Science, and Technology |publisher=Telstar.ote.cmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105164509/http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |archivedate=2010-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems are described and analyzed by means of the methods of mathematics and the natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exergy.se/goran/thesis/ |title=Exergy - A Useful Concept.Intro |publisher=Exergy.se |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human factors, however, have dominated the development of our perspective of the relationship between nature and society since at least the [[Industrial Revolution]], and in particular have influenced how we describe and measure the economic impacts of changes in resource quality. A balanced view of these issues requires an understanding of the physical framework in which all human ideas, institutions, and aspirations must operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Energy_and_economic_myths_(historical) |title=Energy and economic myths (historical) |publisher=Eoearth.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Economics, oil and energy====
[[Image:Oil imports.PNG|thumb|300px|Oil imports by country]]

===Energy return on energy investment===
When oil production first began in the mid-nineteenth century, the largest oil fields recovered fifty barrels of oil for every barrel used in the extraction, transportation and refining. This ratio is often referred to as the Energy Return on Energy Investment (EROI or [[EROEI]]).  Currently, between one and five barrels of oil are recovered for each barrel-equivalent of energy used in the recovery process.  As the EROEI drops to one, or equivalently the [[Net energy gain]] falls to zero, the oil production is no longer a net energy source.  This happens long before the resource is physically exhausted.

Note that it is important to understand the distinction between a barrel of oil, which is a measure of oil, and a [[barrel of oil equivalent]] (BOE), which is a measure of energy. Many sources of energy, such as fission, solar, wind, and coal, are not subject to the same near-term supply restrictions that oil is. Accordingly, even an oil source with an EROEI of 0.5 can be usefully exploited if the energy required to produce that oil comes from a cheap and plentiful energy source.  Availability of cheap, but hard to transport, natural gas in some oil fields has led to using [[natural gas]] to fuel [[enhanced oil recovery]]. Similarly, natural gas in huge amounts is used to power most [[Athabasca Tar Sands]] plants. Cheap natural gas has also led to [[Ethanol fuel]] produced with a net EROEI of less than 1, although figures in this area are controversial because methods to measure EROEI are in debate.

====Growth-based economic models====

Insofar as [[economic growth]] is driven by oil consumption growth, post-peak societies must adapt. [[M. King Hubbert]] believed:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/wwf1976/ |title=Exponential Growth as a Transient Phenomenon in Human History |publisher=Hubbertpeak.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Our principal constraints are cultural.  During the last two centuries we have known nothing but exponential growth and in parallel we have evolved what amounts to an exponential-growth culture, a culture so heavily dependent upon the continuance of exponential growth for its stability that it is incapable of reckoning with problems of nongrowth.}}

Some economists describe the problem as [[uneconomic growth]] or a [[false economy]]. At the political right, [[Fred Ikle]] has warned about "conservatives addicted to the Utopia of Perpetual Growth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dieoff.org/page68.htm |title=Our Perpetual Growth Utopia |publisher=Dieoff.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brief oil interruptions in 1973 and 1979 markedly slowed - but did not stop - the growth of world [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imf.org/external/np/speeches/2006/pdf/050206.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1950 and 1984, as the [[Green Revolution]] transformed [[agriculture]] around the globe, world grain production increased by 250%. The energy for the Green Revolution was provided by [[fossil fuels]] in the form of [[fertilizers]] (natural gas), [[pesticides]] (oil), and [[hydrocarbon]] fueled [[irrigation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wolf.readinglitho.co.uk/mainpages/agriculture.html How peak oil could lead to starvation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818060558/http://wolf.readinglitho.co.uk/mainpages/agriculture.html |date=2007-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Pimentel, professor of ecology and [[agriculture]] at [[Cornell University]], and [[Mario Giampietro]], senior researcher at the National Research Institute on Food and Nutrition (INRAN), place in their study ''Food, Land, Population and the U.S. Economy'' the maximum [[U.S. population]] for a [[sustainability|sustainable economy]] at 200 million. To achieve a sustainable economy [[world population]] will have to be reduced by two-thirds, says the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Taggart |first=Adam |url=http://www.energybulletin.net/281.html |title=Eating Fossil Fuels |publisher=EnergyBulletin.net |date=2003-10-02 |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611071544/http://www.energybulletin.net/281.html |archivedate=2007-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without population reduction, this study predicts an agricultural crisis beginning in 2020, becoming critical c. 2050. The [[Peak oil|peaking of global oil]] along with the decline in regional [[natural gas]] production may precipitate this agricultural crisis sooner than generally expected. [[Dale Allen Pfeiffer]] claims that coming decades could see spiraling [[food]] prices without relief and massive [[starvation]] on a global level such as never experienced before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soilassociation.org/peakoil Peak Oil: the threat to our food security] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714220834/http://www.soilassociation.org/peakoil |date=July 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Oil Drum: Europe |url=http://europe.theoildrum.com/node/2225 |title=Agriculture Meets Peak Oil |publisher=Europe.theoildrum.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hubbert peaks==
Although [[Hubbert peak theory]] receives most attention in relation to [[peak oil|peak oil production]], it has also been applied to other natural resources.

===Natural gas===
{{Main|Peak gas}}
Doug Reynolds predicted in 2005 that the North American peak would occur in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=White |url=http://dwb.adn.com/money/industries/oil/v-printer/story/7296501p-7208184c.html |title=State's consultant says nation is primed for using Alaska gas |date=December 17, 2005 |newspaper=Anchorage Daily News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221153321/http://dwb.adn.com/money/industries/oil/v-printer/story/7296501p-7208184c.html |archivedate=February 21, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bentley (p.&amp;nbsp;189) predicted a world "decline in conventional gas production from about 2020".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Viewpoint - Global oil &amp; gas depletion: an overview

===Coal===
{{Main|Peak coal}}
Peak coal is significantly further out than peak oil, but we can observe the example of [[Anthracite coal|anthracite]] in the USA, a high grade coal whose production peaked in the 1920s.  Anthracite was studied by Hubbert, and matches a curve closely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geo.umn.edu/courses/3005/resource.html GEO 3005: Earth Resources] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725085800/http://www.geo.umn.edu/courses/3005/resource.html |date=July 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pennsylvania's coal production also matches Hubbert's curve closely, but this does not mean that coal in Pennsylvania is exhausted—far from it.  If production in Pennsylvania returned at its all-time high, there are reserves for 190 years.  Hubbert had recoverable [[Coal#World coal reserves|coal reserves worldwide]] at 2500 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; metric tons and peaking around 2150(depending on usage).

More recent estimates suggest an earlier peak. ''Coal: Resources and Future Production'' (PDF 630KB &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energywatchgroup.org/files/Coalreport.pdf |title=Startseite |publisher=Energy Watch Group |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911224731/http://www.energywatchgroup.org/files/Coalreport.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), published on April 5, 2007 by the Energy Watch Group (EWG), which reports to the German Parliament, found that global coal production could peak in as few as 15 years.&lt;ref name="Httpwwwenergybulletinnethtml"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hamilton |first=Rosie |url=http://www.energybulletin.net/29919.html |title=Peak coal: sooner than you think |publisher=Energybulletin.net |date=2007-05-21 |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522155229/http://www.energybulletin.net/29919.html |archivedate=2008-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reporting on this Richard Heinberg also notes that the date of peak annual energetic extraction from coal will likely come earlier than the date of peak in quantity of coal (tons  per year) extracted as the most energy-dense types of coal have been mined most extensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardheinberg.com/museletter/179 |title=Museletter |publisher=Richard Heinberg |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second study,
''The Future of Coal'' by B. Kavalov and S. D. Peteves of the Institute for Energy (IFE), prepared for European Commission Joint Research Centre, reaches similar conclusions and states that
""coal might not be so abundant, widely available and reliable as an energy source in the future".&lt;ref name="Httpwwwenergybulletinnethtml" /&gt;

Work by [[David Rutledge (engineer)|David Rutledge]] of [[Caltech]] predicts that the total of world coal production will amount to only about 450 [[gigatonne]]s.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;"Coal: Bleak outlook for the black stuff", by David Strahan, [[New Scientist]], [https://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/mg19726391.800-coal-bleak-outlook-for-the-black-stuff.html Jan. 19, 2008, pp. 38-41].
&lt;/ref&gt; This
implies that coal is running out faster than usually assumed.

Finally, insofar as global [[peak oil]] and peak in natural gas are expected anywhere from imminently to within decades at most, any increase in coal production (mining) per annum to compensate for declines in oil or NG production, would necessarily translate to an earlier date of peak as compared with peak coal under a scenario in which annual production remains constant.

===Fissionable materials===
{{Main|Peak uranium}}
In a paper in 1956,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527233843/http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  after a review of US fissionable reserves, Hubbert notes of nuclear power:

{{cquote|There is promise, however, provided mankind can solve its international problems and not destroy itself with nuclear weapons, and provided world population (which is now expanding at such a rate as to double in less than a century) can somehow be brought under control, that we may at last have found an energy supply adequate for our needs for at least the next few centuries of the "foreseeable future."}}

Technologies such as the [[thorium fuel cycle]], [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] and [[Fast breeder reactor|fast breeders]] can, in theory, considerably extend the life of [[uranium]] reserves. [[Roscoe Bartlett]] claims &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartlett.house.gov/uploadedfiles/5-2-06%20Oil%20Speech.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025195932/http://www.bartlett.house.gov/uploadedfiles/5-2-06%20Oil%20Speech.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Our current throwaway nuclear cycle uses up the world reserve of low-cost uranium in about 20 years.}}

Caltech physics professor [[David Goodstein]] has stated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Tony|title=Professor Goodstein discusses lowering oil reserves|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2004/s1249211.htm|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=14 April 2013|date=23 November 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509063107/http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2004/s1249211.htm|archive-date=2013-05-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that

{{cquote|... you would have to build 10,000 of the largest power plants that are feasible by engineering standards in order to replace the 10 terawatts of fossil fuel we're burning today ... that's a staggering amount and if you did that, the known reserves of uranium would last for 10 to 20 years at that burn rate. So, it's at best a bridging technology ... You can use the rest of the uranium to breed plutonium 239 then we'd have at least 100 times as much fuel to use. But that means you're making plutonium, which is an extremely dangerous thing to do in the dangerous world that we live in.}}

===Metals===
{{Main|Peak copper}}
Hubbert applied his theory to "rock containing an abnormally high concentration of a given metal"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/wwf1976 |title=Exponential Growth as a Transient Phenomenon in Human History |publisher=Hubbertpeak.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reasoned that the peak production for metals such as [[copper]], [[tin]], [[lead]], [[zinc]] and others would occur in the time frame of decades and [[iron]] in the time frame of two centuries like coal. The price of copper rose 500% between 2003 and 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/copper/mcs-2008-coppe.pdf http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/copper/mcs-2008-coppe.pdf Copper Statistics and Information, 2007].

*'''Fisheries''': At least one researcher has attempted to perform Hubbert linearization ([[Hubbert curve]]) on the [[whaling]] industry, as well as charting the transparently dependent price of caviar on sturgeon depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aspoitalia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=39 |title=How General is the Hubbert Curve? |publisher=Aspoitalia.net |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the [[cod]] of the North Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/laherrere/multihub.htm |title=Laherrere: Multi-Hubbert Modeling |publisher=Hubbertpeak.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comparison of the cases of fisheries and of mineral extraction tells us that the human pressure on the environment is causing a wide range of resources to go through a depletion cycle which follows a Hubbert curve.

==History==
[[File:The Tech Museum of Innovation 01718.JPG|thumb|left|The Tech during the ''[[Magnificent Desolation: Walking on the Moon 3D|Magnificent Desolation: Walking on the Moon]]'' exhibit, 2010.]]
Planning began in 1978 by members of the Junior League of Palo Alto and later assistance by the San Jose Junior League. The first {{convert|20000|sqft|adj=on}} temporary exhibit finally opened in 1990 "The Garage" as it was named, opened in San Jose's former convention center. On October 31, 1998, it opened a brand-new {{convert|132000|sqft|adj=on}} facility and has had 4,000,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The museum is composed of three floors, each with its own significance. The ground floor includes The Tech Store, The Tech Cafe, the IMAX® Dome Theater and a recreational area that is reserved for special events. The Tech's architecture is the work of Mexican architect [[Ricardo Legorreta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herhold|first=Scott|title=Herhold: Designer of two San Jose museums dies in Mexico|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_19660901|publisher=San Jose Mercury News|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four major theme galleries fill the Upper Level and Lower Level of the museum: Communication, Exploration, Innovation and Life Tech. These galleries are constantly being revamped and changed to fit the theme movies and exhibits. On the Lower Level there is also a public piece of artwork titled ''Origin'', which is inside a {{convert|45|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} cylinder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Origin|url=http://www.sanjoseculture.org/public_art/collections/Tech%20Museum%20-%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf|publisher=City of San Jose|accessdate=11 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311062627/http://www.sanjoseculture.org/public_art/collections/Tech%20Museum%20-%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf|archivedate=11 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tech Museum of Innovation reflects its social context, capturing Silicon Valley's celebration of technology with a fascination with what the museum's literature refers to as the "gizmos and gadgets" produced by Valley companies. Early reviews, however, criticized The Tech for failing to provide a coherent direction or message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perrin|first=Andrew|title=Making Silicon Valley : Culture, Representation, and Technology at the Tech Museum|journal=The Communication Review|year=2002|volume=5|issue=2|page=91|doi=10.1080/10714420212479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibits==

[[File:The Tech Museum of Innovation 3 2016-05-14.jpg|thumb|right|An atrium at The Tech.]]
The Tech has many exhibits dealing with energy efficiency, customization, exploration and genetics.

The Tech Museum of Innovation offers a new approach to viewing galleries from a wide variety of different media. The majority of these exhibits are interactive and allows the viewer to engage in the learning experience. The Tech also has joint partnerships with local attractions, ranging from jazz festivals to the Global Festival of Art.

The [[IMAX]] Dome Theater &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaplan|first=Tracey|title=Michael L.

===Temporary exhibitions===
On special occasions The Tech will rent out Parkside Hall from the City of San José to host special larger exhibits. In 2007, this hall was the home to the exhibit known as Body Worlds 2, which brought in over 280,000 guests.  In winter of 2008, there was a special Leonardo da Vinci exhibit (called Leonardo: 500 Years into the Future) that displayed some of his inventions, findings and pictures. It ended January 25, 2009, after a three-week extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetech.org/leonardo/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121122802/http://thetech.org/leonardo/ |archivedate=2009-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cornell University]] Library originally created VIVO in 2003 as a "virtual [[List of life sciences|life sciences]] community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Devare|first1=Medha|last2=Corson-Rikert|first2=Jon|last3=Caruso|first3=Brian|last4=Lowe|first4=Brian|last5=Chiang|first5=Kathy|last6=McCue|first6=Janet|title=VIVO: Connecting People, Creating a Virtual Life Sciences Community|journal=D-Lib|date=2007|volume=13|issue=7/8|url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july07/devare/07devare.html|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, the National Institutes of Health awarded a $12.2 million grant to Cornell, [[University of Florida]], [[Indiana University]], [[Ponce Health Sciences University|Ponce School of Medicine]], [[Scripps Research Institute|The Scripps Research Institute]], [[Washington University]], and [[Weill Cornell Medicine|Weill Cornell Medical College]] to expand the tool for use outside of Cornell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=García-Milian|first1=Rolando|last2=Norton|first2=Hannah F.|last3=Auten|first3=Beth|last4=Davis|first4=Valrie I.|last5=Holmes|first5=Kristi L.|last6=Johnson|first6=Margeaux|last7=Tennant|first7=Michele R.|title=Librarians as Part of Cross-Disciplinary, Multi-institutional Team Projects: Experiences from the VIVO Collaboration|journal=Science &amp; Technology Libraries|date=April 2013|volume=32|issue=2|pages=160–175|doi=10.1080/0194262X.2013.791183|pmc=3700548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data ingest==
VIVO can harvest publication data from [[PubMed]], CSV files, relational databases, or [[OAI-PMH]] harvest.  It then uses a semi-automated process to match publications to researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=Chris|last2=Williams|first2=Stephen|last3=Sposato|first3=Vincent|last4=Skaggs|first4=Nicholas|last5=Raum|first5=Narayan|last6=Corson-Rikert|first6=Jon|last7=Caruso|first7=Brian|last8=Blake|first8=Jim|editor1-last=Börner|editor1-first=Katy|editor2-last=Conlon|editor2-first=Michael|editor3-last=Corson-Rikert|editor3-first=Jon|editor4-last=Ding|editor4-first=Ying|title=VIVO : a semantic approach to scholarly networking and discovery|date=2012|publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool|location=[San Rafael, Calif.]|isbn=9781608459933|chapter=Extending VIVO}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also harvests information about researchers from Human Resources systems and [[Student information system|student information systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About VIVO|url=http://vivoweb.org/info/about-vivo|website=vivoweb.org|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ontology==
The VIVO ontology incorporates elements of several established ontologies, including [[Dublin Core]], [[Bibliographic Ontology]], [[FOAF (ontology)|FOAF]], and [[Simple Knowledge Organization System|SKOS]]. The ontology can be used to describe several [[Professor#Tasks|roles of faculty members]], including research, teaching, and service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Ding|first1=Ying|last2=Mitchell|first2=Stella|last3=Corson-Rikert|first3=Jon|last4=Lowe|first4=Brian|last5=He|first5=Bing|title=The VIVO Ontology: Enabling Networking of Scientists|date=2011|url=http://www.websci11.org/fileadmin/websci/Posters/170_paper.pdf|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch [[Data Archiving and Networked Services]] and [[Indiana University]] worked to develop the ontology to enable bilingual modeling of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chambers|first1=Tamy|last2=Shah|first2=Sahil|last3=Urankar|first3=Ashish|last4=Kalyan|first4=Venkat|last5=Scharnhorst|first5=Andrea|last6=Reijnhoudt|first6=Linda|last7=Rideour|first7=Laura|last8=Guéret|first8=Christophe|last9=Ding|first9=Ying|title=Bilingual researcher profiles: Modeling Dutch researchers in both English and Dutch using the VIVO ontology|journal=Proceedings of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|date=2013|volume=50|issue=1|pages=1–4|doi=10.1002/meet.14505001137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''vertex''' (plural '''vertices''') in [[computer graphics]] is a data structure that describes certain attributes, like the position of a point in 2D or 3D [[space]], at multiple points on a surface.

==Application to 3D models==

[[3D models]] are most-often represented as triangulated [[Polyhedron|polyhedra]] forming a [[triangle mesh]]. Non triangular surfaces can be converted to an array of triangles through [[Tessellation (computer graphics)|tessellation]]. Attributes from the vertices are typically interpolated across mesh surfaces.

==Vertex attributes==

The vertices of triangles are associated not only with spatial position but also with other values used to [[rendering (computer graphics)|render]] the object correctly.  Most attributes of a vertex represent vectors in the space to be [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]]. These vectors are typically 1 (''x''), 2 (''x, y''), or 3 (''x, y, z'') dimensional and can include a fourth [[Homogeneous coordinates|homogeneous coordinate]] (''w''). These values are given meaning by a [[Material (computer graphics)|material]] description. In [[realtime rendering]] these properties are used by a [[vertex shader]] or [[vertex pipeline]].

Such attributes can include:

{{term|Position}}
{{defn|2D or 3D coordinates representing a position in space}}

{{term|Color}}
{{defn|Typically diffuse or specular [[RGB]] values, either representing surface colour or [[precomputed lighting]] information.}}

{{term|Reflectance}}
{{defn|of the surface at the vertex, e.g. [[specular exponent]], metallicity, fresnel values.}}

{{term|Texture coordinates}}
{{defn|Also known as [[UV coordinates]],these control the [[texture mapping]] of the surface, possibly for multiple layers.}}
{{term|normal vectors|content=[[Normal (geometry)|normal vectors]]}}
{{defn|These define an approximated curved surface at the location of the vertex, used for lighting calculations (such as [[Phong shading]]), [[normal mapping]], or [[displacement mapping]], and to control subdivision.}}
{{term|tangent vectors|content=[[tangent vectors]]}}
{{defn| These define an approximated curved surface at the location of the vertex, used for lighting calculations (such as [[Phong shading]]), [[normal mapping]], or [[displacement mapping]], and to control subdivision.}}

{{term|[[Weight maps|Blend weights]]}}
{{term|[[Weight maps|Bone weights]]}}
{{defn|[[Weighting]] for assignment to bones to control deformation in [[skeletal animation]].}}

{{term|Blend shapes}}
{{defn|Multiple position vectors may be specified to be blended over time, especially for [[facial animation]].}}
