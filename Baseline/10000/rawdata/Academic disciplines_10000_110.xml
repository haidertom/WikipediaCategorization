      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1307">The '''American Posture League''' of the [[United States]] was established and initially funded by educator [[Jessie H. Bancroft]], Henry Ling Taylor, an orthopedic surgeon, and Dr. [[Eliza Mosher]]. The idea of the league was to combine scientific research with business: based on research in posture, they gave recommendations to businesses (manufacturers of footwear, furniture, etc.) and charging fees for contractual use the League labels. To the latter end, the '''Posture Standards Company''' was formed, to keep business separate from science, since the commercialization of science was one of the criticisms of the League. The enterprise was not a commercial success, but [[George J. Fisher]] (a former President of the League) notes that the founder trio were repaid all their investments, with the exception of the founding free gifts. &lt;ref&gt;[[George J. Fisher]], "The American Posture League", "The Journal of Health and Physical Education", Volume 6, Issue 8, 1935, {{doi|10.1080/23267240.1935.10625699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arabid race''' (also '''Orientalid race''') is a historical term for a morphological subtype of the [[Caucasian race|Caucasoid race]], as used in traditional [[physical anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;John R. Baker Race. — New York and London: Oxford University Press, 1974. — P. 625. {{ISBN|978-0-936396-04-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
The Arabid race is thought to have originated within the [[Arabian Peninsula]], and it is currently predominant there as well. It is a major element in the [[Levant]] region of the [[Middle East]], and a minor element in other parts of [[Western Asia]].&lt;ref name=TROE1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theapricity.com/snpa/chapter-XI2.htm|title=The Mediterranean race in Arabia|website=Theapricity.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The type is known as ''Araboid'' in forensic pathology and anthropology. In the [[Near East]] region, it is heavily mixed with the [[Armenoid race]]. This Armenoid-Araboid hybrid type is alternatively known as the ''Assyrid''.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The ancient [[Phoenicia]]ns, who were ancestral to the Lebanese and Syrians, also generally belonged to this type. Gulf Arabs, also known as [[Arabian]] Arabs or true Arabs, among whom are the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudis]], [[Bahrain]]is, [[Kuwait]]is, southern Iraqis and the [[Bedouin]]s, are more frequently of classic Arabid type. In areas bordering the [[Iranian plateau]], the Arabid type also not seldom merges with the [[Irano-Afghan race]], a local Mediterranean subtype.&lt;ref name=TROE1/&gt;

In parts of [[North Africa]], primarily among the Arabic-speaking Bedouin herders of the deserts and oases of the [[Maghreb]] and [[Egypt]], the Arabid type fuses with another local Mediterranean subtype, the [[Hamitic]], to produce a new hybrid morphological type. The Hamitic type, however, predominates throughout, especially among the [[Berbers]] as well as the [[Copts]] and [[Fellah]]in, since it is the taxon to which belonged most [[Ancient Libyan]]s and [[Ancient Egypt]]ians, respectively.&lt;ref name=TROE2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theapricity.com/snpa/chapter-XI9.htm|title=The modern Egyptians|website=Theapricity.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TROE3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theapricity.com/snpa/chapter-XI12.htm|title=The Tuareg|website=Theapricity.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TROE4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theapricity.com/snpa/chapter-XI13.htm|title=Eastern Barbary, Algeria and Tunisia|website=Theapricity.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar, minor Arabid element is found in parts of the [[Horn of Africa]], having been introduced from the [[Persian Gulf]] region in historic times by the first Islamic proselytizers as well as the adjacent [[Himyarite Kingdom|Himyarites]] and [[Sabaeans]] of [[Hadhramaut]]. However, here again the Arabid element is secondary to the predominant Hamitic type of the region's first [[Afroasiatic languages|Hamito-Semitic]] speakers, who were ancestral to the [[Somalis]], [[Habesha people|Abyssinians]] and other [[Ethiopid race|Ethiopid]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theapricity.com/snpa/chapter-XI8.htm|title=The Mediterranean race in East Africa|website=Theapricity.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Sudan]] area, classic Arabid types can be found among the [[Kababish]] and certain other Arabic-speaking desert tribes collectively known as [[Sudanese Arabs]]. Here, they often occur in solution with the local Hamitic Mediterranean type, which was the morphological taxon to which belonged the [[A-Group Culture|A-Group]], [[C-Group Culture|C-Group]] and [[Meroe|Meroitic]] culture makers, among certain other early populations in the region. Elsewhere, Arabid elements fuse with the [[Negroid]] type of the region's indigenous [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] speakers, the [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotes]], thereby producing an [[Afro-Arab]] hybrid type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2843546|title=Some Aspects of the Hamitic Problem in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.|first=C. G.|last=Seligmann|date=28 October 2017|journal=The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|volume=43|pages=593–705|accessdate=|doi=10.2307/2843546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Iberian Peninsula]], a rather tall, gracile, progressive, procopomorphic and high-skulled South Mediterranean type related to the Hamitic variety of North Africa is the predominant element. However, instead of Arabid, it is usually mixed here with low-skulled, long-skulled ([[dolichocephalic]]), short-statured Berid and West Mediterranid subtypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theapricity.com/snpa/lundman-races4.htm|title=Systematic Appendix: The Races of Europe|website=Theapricity.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theapricity.com/snpa/lundman-races.htm|title=The living races and peoples of Europe|website=Theapricity.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical appearance==
The Arabid race is distinguished from the West-Mediterranean race by some minor characteristic facial traits. The Arabid physical type had in earlier times a broader-formed Syrid subtype, which was found among the farmers of the [[Fertile Crescent]].

[[File:Knapofhowarinsun.jpg|thumb|300px|The stone building at [[Knap of Howar]], Orkney, one of the oldest surviving houses in north-west Europe]]
The architecture of Scotland in the prehistoric era includes all human building within the modern borders of Scotland, before the arrival of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in Britain in the first century BCE. [[Stone Age]] settlers began to build in wood in what is now Scotland from at least 8,000 years ago. The first permanent houses of stone were constructed around 6,000 years ago, as at [[Knap of Howar]], [[Orkney]] and settlements like [[Skara Brae]]. There are also large numbers of [[chambered tomb]]s and [[cairn]]s from this era, particularly in the west and north. In the south and east there are earthen [[Tumulus|barrow]]s, often linked to timber monuments of which only remnants remain. Related structures include [[bank barrow]]s, [[cursus monument]]s, [[mortuary enclosure]]s and [[Neolithic long house|timber halls]]. From the [[Bronze Age]] there are fewer new buildings, but there is evidence of [[crannog]]s, roundhouses built on an artificial islands and of [[Clava cairn]]s and the first [[hillfort]]s. From the [[Iron Age]] there is evidence of substantial stone [[Atlantic roundhouse]]s, which include [[broch]] towers, smaller [[duns]]. There is also evidence of about 1,000 [[List of hill forts in Scotland|hillforts in Scotland]], most located below the Clyde-Forth line.

[[File:MaesHowe.jpg|thumb|right|[[Maes Howe]], a [[passage grave]] on Orkney]]
The oldest house for which there is evidence in Britain is the oval structure of wooden posts found at [[South Queensferry]] near the [[Firth of Forth]], dating from the [[Mesolithic]] period, about 8240 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;R. Gray, [http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/bridge-works-uncover-nations-oldest-house.19439382 "Bridge works uncover nation's oldest house"], ''Herald Scotland'', 18 November 2012, retrieved 7 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest stone structures are probably the three hearths found at [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]], dated to about 6000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;A. Moffat, ''Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History'' (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2005), {{ISBN|0500287953}}, pp. 90–1.&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of agriculture, groups of settlers began building stone houses on what is now Scottish soil in the [[Neolithic]] era, around 6,000 years ago, and the first villages around 500 years later.&lt;ref name=Maxwell2005p19/&gt; Neolithic habitation, burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well-preserved in the [[Northern Isles|Northern]] and [[Western Isles]], where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone.&lt;ref name=Pryor2003pp98-104&amp;246-50&gt;F. Pryor, ''Britain BC'' (London: HarperPerennial, 2003), {{ISBN|978-0-00-712693-4}}, pp. 98–104 and 246–50.&lt;/ref&gt; The stone building at [[Knap of Howar]] at [[Papa Westray]], [[Orkney]] is one of the oldest surviving houses in north-west Europe, making use of locally gathered rubble in a dry-stone construction, it was probably occupied for 900 years, between 3700 and 2800 BCE.&lt;ref name=Maxwell2005p19&gt;I. Maxwell, ''A History of Scotland’s Masonry Construction'' in P. Wilson, ed., ''Building with Scottish Stone'' (Edinburgh: Arcamedia, 2005), {{ISBN|1-904320-02-3}}, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Skara Brae]] on the [[Mainland, Orkney|Mainland]] of Orkney also dates from this era, occupied from about 3100 to 2500 BCE and is Europe's most complete Neolithic village.&lt;ref name=Pryor2003pp98-104&amp;246-50/&gt;

There are also large numbers of [[chambered tomb]]s and [[Chambered cairn|cairns]] from this period. Many different types have been identified, but they can be roughly grouped into [[passage grave]]s, [[gallery grave]]s and [[stone cist]]s. Cists are relatively simple box-like graves, usually made up of stone slaps and covered with a large stone or slab.&lt;ref&gt;G. Noble, ''Neolithic Scotland: Timber, Stone, Earth and Fire'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006), {{ISBN|0748623388}}, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maes Howe]], near Stenness on the mainland of Orkney (dated 3400–3200 BCE) and Monamore, Isle of Arran (dated approximately 3500 BCE) are passage graves, of [[megalith]] construction, built with large stones, many of which weigh several tons.&lt;ref name=Fry&amp;Fry1992p7&gt;F. Somerset Fry and P. Somerset Fry, ''The History of Scotland'' (London: Routledge, 1992), {{ISBN|0710090013}}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Gallery graves are rectangular gallery-like spaces, where the entrance at one end is the width of the gallery. These were sometimes lined or roofed with slabs and then covered with earth.&lt;ref name=Fry&amp;Fry1992p8&gt;F. Somerset Fry and P. Somerset Fry, ''The History of Scotland'' (London: Routledge, 1992), {{ISBN|0710090013}}, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most impressive surviving monuments of the period are the first sets of standing stones in Scotland, such as those at [[Standing Stones of Stenness|Stenness]] on the mainland of Orkney, which date from about 3100 BCE, of four stones, the tallest of which is {{convert|16|ft|m|0}} in height.&lt;ref&gt;C. Wickham-Jones, ''Orkney: A Historical Guide'' (Edinburgh: Birlinn, 2007), {{ISBN|1780270011}}, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Standing Stones of Callanish (Callanish I) (9605427).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Callanish Stones]], one of the finest stone circles in Scotland]]
In contrast to the Highlands and Islands where stone was extensively used, in the south and east the most visible architectural survivals of the Neolithic are mainly earthen [[Tumulus|barrow]]s, the earliest probably dating from the beginning of the fourth millennium BCE. Today these monuments consist of massive mounds of earth or stone, most commonly trapezoidal in plan and often orientated to the east. They are widely distributed in the Lowlands, particularly in Aberdeenshire, Angus, Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders.&lt;ref&gt;G. Noble, ''Neolithic Scotland: Timber, Stone, Earth and Fire'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006), {{ISBN|0748623388}}, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Related structures include [[bank barrow]]s, [[cursus monument]]s, [[mortuary enclosure]]s, [[Neolithic long house|timber halls]], and other forms of enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;G. Noble, ''Neolithic Scotland: Timber, Stone, Earth and Fire'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006), {{ISBN|0748623388}}, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Bank barrows are parallel-sided mounds, usually flanked by ditches on either side. Originally believed to be Roman in origin, cursus monuments also consist of long parallel lengths of banks of earth with external ditches, but with an open avenue or enclose between. Both forms are usually associated with burial chambers.&lt;ref&gt;J. Pollard, ''Neolithic Britain'' (Osprey, 2008), {{ISBN|0747803536}}, pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of bank barrows in Scotland include from Perthshire the long mound at Auchenlaich and the hybrid bank barrow/cursus monument and at Cleaven Dyke, which stretches for over {{convert|1.5|miles|km|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bradley, ''The Prehistory of Britain and Ireland'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0521848113}}, pp. 62–4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. J. Barclay and G. S. Maxwell, ''The Cleaven Dyke and Littleour: Monuments in the Neolithic of Tayside'' (Society Antiquaries Scotland, 1998), {{ISBN|090390313X}}, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortuary enclosures are usually sub-rectangular banks with external ditches and raised platforms of stone or wood within them, thought by J. G. Scott to be used for the exposure of corpses prior to burial elsewhere, although this interpretation is disputed. Remains of mortuary enclosures of this period are often found under [[long barrow]]s. Key examples include Pitnacree, Perthshire and two closely related sites at Lochhill and Slewcairn, both in [[Kirkcudbright]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Noble, ''Neolithic Scotland: Timber, Stone, Earth and Fire'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006), {{ISBN|0748623388}}, pp. 72–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The timber halls are probably unique to Scotland and were massive roofed buildings made of oak, all of which seem to have been subsequently burnt down. There is debate as to the role of these buildings, which have been seen variously as regular farming homesteads of Neolithic families and as related to a series of monumental constructions such as barrows.&lt;ref&gt;G. Noble, ''Neolithic Scotland: Timber, Stone, Earth and Fire'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006), {{ISBN|0748623388}}, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The hall at [[Balbridie]], Aberdeenshire was {{convert|85|ft|m|0}} long, {{convert|43|ft|m|0}} wide and may have had a roof {{convert|30|ft|m|0}} high, making it large enough to accommodate up to 50 people.&lt;ref&gt;A. Moffat, ''Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History'' (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2005), {{ISBN|0500287953}}, pp. 109–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

As bronze working developed from about 2000 BCE, there was a decline in the building of large new structures, which, with a reduction of the total area under cultivation, suggests a fall in population.&lt;ref&gt;A. Moffat, ''Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History'' (London. Thames &amp; Hudson, 2005), {{ISBN|0500287953}}, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Early Bronze Age|Early]] and [[Middle Bronze Age]] there is evidence of cellular round houses of stone, as at [[Jarlshof]] and [[Sumburgh, Shetland|Sumburgh]] on Shetland.&lt;ref name=Cunliffe2004p60&gt;B. Cunliffe, ''Iron Age Communities in Britain: An Account of England, Scotland and Wales from the Seventh Century BC until the Roman Conquest ''(New York, NY: Routledge, 2004), {{ISBN|0415347793}}, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; At Jarlshof these are oval houses with thick stone walls, which may have been partly subterranean at the earliest period of inhabitation, a technique that provided both structural stability and insulation.&lt;ref&gt;I. Armit, '' Towers in the North: The Brochs of Scotland'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7524-1932-3}}, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence of the occupation of [[crannog]]s, roundhouses partially or entirely built on an artificial islands, usually in lakes, rivers and estuarine waters.&lt;ref&gt;N. Dixon ''The Crannogs of Scotland: An Underwater Archaeology'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7524-3151-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They were often constructed of layers of brushwood and rubble. Sometimes they were [[Revetment|revetted]] around the edges with vertical [[Deep foundation|piles]] and sometimes surfaced with logs of oak.&lt;ref name=Cunliffe2004p340/&gt;

The creation of cairns and Megalithic monuments continued into this period. There are approximately fifty [[Clava cairn]]s in Scotland, named after those at Balnuaran of Clava near Inverness. They take two distinct forms, either a circular rubble enclosure known as "ring cairns", or passage graves, with a long entrance, usually in complex astronomical alignments.&lt;ref&gt;C. Scarre, ''Monuments and Landscape in Atlantic Europe: Perception and Society during the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age'' (New York: Routledge, 2002), {{ISBN|0415273145}}, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; As elsewhere in Europe, [[hill forts]] were first introduced in this period, including the occupation of [[Eildon hill]] near Melrose in the [[Scottish Borders]], from around 1000 BCE, which accommodated several hundred houses on a fortified hilltop,&lt;ref&gt;A. Moffat, ''Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History'' (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2005), {{ISBN|0500287953}}, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Traprain Law]] in East Lothian, which had a 20-acre enclosure, sectioned in two places west of the summit, made up of a coursed, stone wall with a rubble core.&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Harding, ''The Iron Age in Northern Britain: Celts and Romans, Natives and Invaders'' (New York: Routledge, 2004), {{ISBN|0415301505}}, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early Iron Age, from the seventh century BCE, cellular houses begin to be replaced on the northern isles by simple [[Atlantic roundhouse]]s, substantial circular buildings with a drystone construction. Important examples are at Quanterness, Bu, [[Pierowall]], and Tofts Ness on Orkney, and at Clickhimin on Shetland. From about 400 BC more complex Atlantic roundhouses began to be built, as at Howe, Orkney and [[Crosskirk Broch|Crosskirk]], Caithness.&lt;ref name=Cunliffe2004p325&gt;B.

The most massive constructions that date from this era are the circular [[broch]] towers, probably dating from about 200 BCE. They are drystone hollow-walled structures that are unique to Scotland.&lt;ref name=Cunliffe2004p325/&gt; Most ruins only survive up to a few metres above ground level, although there are five extant examples of towers whose walls still exceed {{convert|21|ft|m|0}} in height.&lt;ref&gt;I.

'''Army engineering maintenance''' consists of those [[engineers]], [[technicians]], and military organizations responsible for the expert repair and maintenance of [[army]] vehicles,  weapon systems, and other equipment.

Army engineering maintenance should not be confused with [[military engineering]] which is distinctly separate and analogous to [[civil engineering]] while the former analogous to [[mechanical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]].

== Operational and tactical level focus ==
At the operational and tactical levels, army engineering maintenance is focused on the repair and scheduled maintenance work required to keep army equipment fleets operational.

== Strategic level focus ==
At the strategic level, army engineering maintenance is closely linked to [[military logistics]].  At this level, it includes work such as the design, development, and testing of new vehicles and weapon systems.  It also includes [[Product lifecycle management|lifecycle management]] activities once new systems become operational.

==History==

[[Mathew D. McCubbins|Mathew McCubbins]], [[Roger Noll]], and [[Barry Weingast]] first defined the theory of bureaucratic drift in 1987.&lt;ref name="McCubbins"/&gt; They argued that drift is essentially a principal-agent problem that explores "how—or indeed, whether—elected political officials can reasonably effectively assure that their policy intentions will be carried out."&lt;ref name="McCubbins"/&gt; The major tenets of the theory include how bureaucrats can manipulate policy when creating bureaucratic agencies and the argument that delay built into the bureaucracy is a good thing, because delay gives government a chance to perfect a policy over time.&lt;ref name="McCubbins"/&gt;

In 1989, Murray Horn and Kenneth Shepsle proposed that coalitional drift, the phenomenon of present legislation being overwritten by the changing views of [[political coalitions]], is a trade-off to bureaucratic drift.&lt;ref name="Horn"/&gt; The relationship between bureaucratic and coalitional drift is a disputed part of the bureaucratic drift theory.&lt;ref name="Macey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Horn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shepsle(1992)" /&gt;

In 1992, [[Jonathan R. Macey|Jonathan Macey]] hypothesized that the creation of an agency's structure and design is instrumental in preventing bureaucratic drift.&lt;ref name="Macey"/&gt; Macey speculates that both current interest groups and Congress benefit from the careful structure and design of a bureaucratic agency. The former is pleased by policies that continue to reflect their preferences while the latter is pleased that both bureaucratic and coalitional drift are protected against.&lt;ref name="Macey"/&gt; Contrary to Horn and Shepsle, Macey argues that coalitional drift and bureaucratic drift aren't necessarily opposing forces, but that the careful construction of an agency's structure and design can mitigate the costs of both types of drift.&lt;ref name="Macey"/&gt; He also disagrees with McCubbins, Noll and Weingast on the power of delay to reduce bureaucratic drift, because extra time gives future interest groups and a future Congress the opportunity to insert their own preferences into the proposed policy.&lt;ref name="Macey"/&gt; This is an example of coalitional and bureaucratic drift working counter to each other.

==Causes==
Scholars have identified three major areas that contribute to bureaucratic drift: how bureaucracies are structured, interest groups that lobby bureaucracies, and presidential appointments of bureaucratic leaders.

===Structural===
Bureaucratic agencies are often structured so that legislators and their staffers have the opportunity to easily monitor bureaucratic activity.&lt;ref name = Shepsle(1992)&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shepsle|first=Kenneth|title=Bureaucratic Drift, Coalitional Drift, and Time Consistency: A Comment on Macey|journal=Journal of Law, Economics, &amp; Organization|date=March 1992|jstor=10.2307/764892}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some scholars believe that structural organization can help lessen bureaucratic drift,&lt;ref name = Macy(1992)&gt;{{cite journal|last=Macey|first=Jonathan|title=Organizational Design and Political Control of Administrative Agencies|journal=Journal of Law, Economics, &amp; Organization|date=March 1992|volume=8|jstor=10.2307/764891}}&lt;/ref&gt; other scholars have found that this approach can backfire.&lt;ref name = "Shepsle(1992)"/&gt; When a bureaucracy is permeable anyone can access it, including legislators who were originally adverse to the legislation being implemented.&lt;ref name = "Shepsle(1992)"/&gt; Further, scholars argue that if a bureaucratic agency is designed to represent a single interest, its implementations are more likely to reflect the views of the people they are representing than they are the views of the legislature.&lt;ref name = "Macy(1992)"/&gt;

===Lobbying===
Making bureaucracies easily accessible means that interest groups can have a greater influence on the outcome of policy implementation.&lt;ref name = "Macy(1992)"/&gt; Some scholars believe that bureaucracies can have positive interactions with interest groups.&lt;ref name = Chubbs&gt;{{cite book|last=Chubb|first=John|title=Interest groups and the bureaucracy: the politics of energy|year=1983|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Sanford, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such an interaction is when interest groups support bureaucracies by providing information and facts about areas the bureaucracy is meant to promote or serve.&lt;ref name = "Chubbs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=John|title=Interest Groups, Advisory Committees, and Congressional Control of the Bureaucracy|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=October 2001|doi=10.2307/2669325|volume=45|pages=799}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other scholars, however, have found that interest groups can cause bureaucratic drift. When a bureaucratic agency is infiltrated or corrupted by an external group whose views do not align with the preferences of the legislature it is said that the bureaucratic agency is captured.&lt;ref name=Shapiro&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Stuart|title=Procedural Control of the Bureaucracy, Peer Review and Epistemic Drift|journal=Journal of Public Administrative Research and Theory|pages=535–538|doi=10.1093/jopart/mul026|volume=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schoenbrod&gt;{{cite book|last=Schoenbrod|first=David|title=Power Without Responsibility|year=1993|publisher=Yale University}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an interest group negotiates with a bureaucracy, it can bias the bureaucracy to implement policy that drifts from the original intention of the legislation so the policy instead better serves the needs of the interest group.&lt;ref name = Bertelli&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bertelli|first=Anthony|title=Remedial Bargaining and Bureaucratic Drift|journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Politics]]|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential appointments===
Scholars consider presidents active in the affairs of "independent" bureaucracies.&lt;ref name = Cromartie&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Joseph|author2=Jane S. Cromartie|title=Partisan Presidential Change and Regulatory Policy: The Case of the FTC and Deceptive Practices Enforcement|journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly|year=1982|volume=12|issue=4|jstor=10.2307/27547869}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presidential nominations are sometimes considered a check on bureaucracies because it ensures reliable agent performance.&lt;ref name=LGS /&gt; However, presidents can use appointments for political gain.&lt;ref name=Nokken&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nokken|first=Timothy|title=Confirmation Dynamics: A Model of Presidential Appointments to Independent Agencies|journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Politics]]|volume=12|issue=1|pages=91–112|doi=10.1177/0951692800012001004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A president may wish to maintain bureaucratic drift if it lies in his or her favor.&lt;ref name="Nokken"/&gt;  An administrative agency can be captured by a president when he or she appoints a bureaucratic head that reaffirms bureaucratic drift that is favorable to the president's policies.&lt;ref name=Balla&gt;{{cite journal|last=Balla|first=Steven|title=Administrative Procedures and Political Control of the Bureaucracy|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=92|issue=3|pages=663–673|doi=10.2307/2585488}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Nokken"/&gt;  In cases where bureaucratic drift is present, scholars believe that the president can change policy more rapidly than in a zero-drift scenario.&lt;ref name = "Balla"/&gt;

==Checks==

===Legislative checks===

Through congressional acts, the legislative branch has the power to curb bureaucratic drift.&lt;ref name="textbook"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lowi, Theodore J.|author2=Benjamin Ginsberg|author3=Kenneth A. Shepsle|author4=Stephen Ansolabehere|lastauthoramp=y|title=American Government: Power and Purpose the Brief Twelfth Edition|location=New York|publisher=Norton|year=2002|pages=219–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamm"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamm | first1 = Keith E. | last2 = Robertson | first2 = Roby D. | year = 1981 | title = Factors Influencing the Adoption of New Methods of Legislative Oversight in the U.

[[Mathew D. McCubbins|Mathew McCubbins]] and Thomas Schwartz have categorized oversight into two types- police patrol and fire alarm patrol.&lt;ref name="textbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCubbins-Schwartz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="firealarm"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lupia | first1 = Arthur | last2 = McCubbins | first2 = Mathew D. | year = 1994 | title = Learning from Oversight: Fire Alarms and Police Patrols Reconstructed | journal = Journal of Law, Economics, &amp; Organization | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 96–117 | jstor=764815 | doi=10.1093/jleo/10.1.96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police patrol refers to oversight when legislators instigate investigations into bureaucracies and actively search for bureaucratic drift.&lt;ref name="McCubbins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="textbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="firealarm"/&gt; Such oversight may involve legislators monitoring agencies, reading reports, conducting field studies, and questioning officials.&lt;ref name="McCubbins"/&gt; Unlike police patrol, Congress also uses fire-alarm patrol by constructing procedures that allow citizens and interest groups to alert legislators of drift.&lt;ref name="textbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="firealarm"/&gt; This method involves less action by congress, and McCubbins and Schwartz argue that it is preferred by legislators as it allows them to devote less time and resources to oversight.&lt;ref name="textbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCubbins-Schwartz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hopenhayn"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hopenhayn | first1 = Hugo | last2 = Lohmann | first2 = Susanne | year = 1996 | title = Fire-Alarm Signals and the Political Oversight of Regulatory Agencies | journal = Journal of Law, Economics, &amp; Organization | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 196–212 | jstor=765043 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.jleo.a023357}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ogul | first1 = Morris S. | last2 = Rockman | first2 = Bert A. | year = 1990 | title = Overseeing Oversight: New Departures and Old Problems | journal = Legislative Studies Quarterly | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 5–24 | jstor=439999 | doi=10.2307/439999}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other scholars criticize fire-alarm patrol by arguing that citizens' complaints may never reach legislators and those that do may be deceitful, thus sounding "false alarms".&lt;ref name="firealarm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hopenhayn"/&gt;

===Judicial checks===

Because of the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]], the judicial branch is able to check bureaucratic drift through [[judicial review]].&lt;ref name="Macey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesquita"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mesquita | first1 = De | last2 = Bueno | first2 = Ethan | last3 = Stephenson | first3 = Matthew C. | year = 2007 | title = Regulatory Quality Under Imperfect Oversight | url = | journal = American Political Science Review | volume = 101 | issue = 3| page = 605 | doi=10.1017/s0003055407070359}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Epstein"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Epstein | first1 = David | last2 = O'Halloran | first2 = Sharyn | year = 1994 | title = Administrative Procedures, Information, and Agency Discretion | journal = American Journal of Political Science | volume = 38 | issue = 3| pages = 697–722 | jstor=2111603 | doi=10.2307/2111603}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Macey2"&gt;Macey, Jonathon R. "Separated Powers and Positive Political Theory: The tug of war over Administrative 	Agencies" Yale Law School Scholarship 1/1/1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephenson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stephenson | first1 = Matthew C | year = 2007 | title = Bureaucratic Decision Costs and Endogenous Agency Expertise | url = | journal = Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization | volume = 23 | issue = 2| pages = 469–498 | doi=10.1093/jleo/ewm030}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scholars have argued that the judicial branch checks bureaucratic drift most efficiently when controlling delays of implementing law. Timing is important because the process gives less organized groups time to learn about proposed actions and respond to these proposals.&lt;ref name=Macey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macey2/&gt;
The same scholars point out that ongoing delays caused by judicial review on agency actions may discourage less organized interest, because such groups lack the resources necessary to maintain an effective coalition over long periods of time.&lt;ref name=Macey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macey2/&gt; Other scholars argue that judicial review also allows less organized groups to hire lawyers to assist in monitoring agency actions.&lt;ref name=Macey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Horn/&gt;

===Executive checks===

The president has the power to check bureaucratic drift through [[executive order]]s and by choosing appointees for the highest post of bureaucracies.&lt;ref name="McCubbins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Balla" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Macey2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = B.

Scholars argue that one problem of the executive branch working to reduce bureaucratic drift is that it wastes time and resources that could be spent serving constituents.&lt;ref name=McCubbins/&gt;&lt;ref name=Balla/&gt;
Also other scholars point out that future coalitions may tamper with carefully negotiated bargains.

==Implications==
While some scholars believe that delegation is a necessary part of the American government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = Marci A | year = 1995 | title = Power, Responsibility, and Republican Democracy | url = | journal = Michigan Law Review | volume = 93 | issue = 6| pages = 1539–1558 | doi=10.2307/1289892}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and that bureaucratic drift is a risk that must be weighed when delegating implementation powers, others believe that delegation of power to bureaucracy is both unconstitutional and happens too frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Allen | first1 = Marc | last2 = Meier | first2 = Kenneth J. | year = 1990 | title = Presidential Control versus Bureaucratic Power: Explaining the Reagan Revolution in Antitrust | journal = American Journal of Political Science | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 269–87 | jstor=2111519 | doi = 10.2307/2111519 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schoenbrod | first1 = David | year = 2003 | title = Politics and the Principle That Elected Legislators Should Make the Laws | url = | journal = Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy | volume = 26 | issue = 1| page = 239 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Schoenbrod, David|title=Rule of law: It's time Congress took back its power to make laws|work=Wall Street Journal, |edition=Eastern|date=6 December 1995|page=A21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Does Congress Delegate Too Much Power To Agencies And What Should Be Done About It? US House of Representatives, 2000. {{ISBN|0160659973}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  These scholars subscribe to the Non-delegation Doctrine, and believe that the risk posed by bureaucratic drift is disruptive enough to American politics that delegation must be reconsidered or even eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bergin | first1 = Amee | year = 2001 | title = Does Application Of The APA'S 'Committed To Agency Discretion' Exception Violate The Nondelegation Doctrine? | url = | journal = Boston College Environmental Affairs Law Review | volume = 28 | issue = 2-3| pages = 363–398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schoenbrod, David|title=Power Without Responsibility: How Congress Abuses the People Through Delegation|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8142">'''The Cambridge English Corpus''' (formerly the Cambridge International Corpus) is a multi-billion word corpus of [[English language]] (containing both [[text corpus]] and spoken corpus data). The Cambridge English Corpus (CEC) contains data from a number of sources including written and spoken, British and American English. The CEC also contains the Cambridge Learner Corpus, a 40m word corpus made up from English exam responses written by English language learners.

The Cambridge English Corpus is used to inform Cambridge University Press [[English Language Teaching]] publications as well as for research in [[corpus linguistics]]. Access is currently restricted to authors and researchers working on projects and publications for [[Cambridge University Press]], and researchers at [[Cambridge English Language Assessment]].&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge International Corpus, http://www.cambridge.org/us/esl/catalog/subject/custom/item3637700/Cambridge-International-Corpus-Cambridge-International-Corpus/?site_locale=en_US&lt;/ref&gt;

== Written Data ==
The Cambridge English Corpus contains instances of modern written English, taken from newspapers, magazines, novels, letters, emails, textbooks, websites, and many other sources.

== Spoken Data ==
The Cambridge English Corpus contains a wide variety of spoken English language, taken from many sources, including everyday conversations, telephone calls, radio broadcasts, presentations, speeches, meetings, TV programmes and lectures.

== Cambridge Learner Corpus ==
The Cambridge Learner Corpus (CLC) is a collection of exam scripts written by students learning English, built in collaboration with Cambridge English Language Assessment. The CLC contains scripts from over 180,000 students, from around 200 countries, speaking 138 different [[first language]]s and is growing all the time.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Learner Corpus, http://www.cambridge.org/us/esl/catalog/subject/custom/item3646603/Cambridge-International-Corpus-Cambridge-Learner-Corpus/?site_locale=en_US&lt;/ref&gt; The exams currently included are:

* KET [[Cambridge English: Key (KET)|Key English Test]] (and KET for schools)
* PET [[Preliminary English Test]] (and PET for schools)
* FCE [[First Certificate in English]]
* CAE [[Certificate in Advanced English]]
* CPE [[Certificate of Proficiency in English]]
* BEC [[Business English Certificate]] (all levels)
* IELTS [[International English Language Testing System]] (academic and general training)
* CELS Certificates in English Language Skills
* ILEC International Legal English Certificate
* ICFE International Certificate in Financial English
* Skills for Life

A unique feature of the Cambridge Learner Corpus is its error coding system. Language specialists identify and annotate errors in the exam scripts. This means that the Corpus can be used to find out about the frequency of different types of errors, the contexts that the errors are made in and the student groups that find particular language areas difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Nicholls, http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/publications/CL2003/papers/nicholls.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors of Cambridge [[English Language Teaching]] resources can use this information to target common errors – for example, the Cambridge Advanced Learner’s Dictionary contains ‘Common mistake’ features which highlight frequent learner errors.

Conversely, the error coding system also reveals what students can achieve at each level. This is central to the work of [[English Profile]], a collaborative programme to enhance the learning, teaching and assessment of English worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;English Profile project, http://www.englishprofile.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11&amp;Itemid=2&lt;/ref&gt; The founding partners are [[Cambridge University Press]], [[Cambridge English Language Assessment]], the [[University of Cambridge]], the [[University of Bedfordshire]], the [[British Council]] and English UK.&lt;ref&gt;English Profile, http://www.englishprofile.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=24&amp;Itemid=22&lt;/ref&gt; The project’s aim is to describe what learners know and can do in English at each level of the [[Common European Framework of Reference]] (CEFR).&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe, CEFR levels,{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/CADRE_EN.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030205032/http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/CADRE_EN.asp |archivedate=2009-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specialized corpora ==
The Cambridge English Corpus contains a number of specialized corpora:

=== Cambridge Business English Corpus ===
The Cambridge Business English Corpus is a large collection of British and American business language, including reports and documents, books relating to different aspects of business, and the business sections from many national newspapers.

The Cambridge Business English Corpus also includes the '''Cambridge and Nottingham Spoken Business English Corpus''' (CANBEC), the result of a joint project between [[Cambridge University Press]] and the [[University of Nottingham]]. This is a collection of recordings of English from companies of all sizes, ranging from big multinational companies to small partnerships. It contains formal and informal meetings, presentations, telephone conversations, lunchtime conversations, and spoken language from other business situations.

=== Cambridge Legal English Corpus ===
The Cambridge Legal English Corpus contains books, journals and newspaper articles relating to the law and legal processes.

=== Cambridge Financial English Corpus ===
The Cambridge Financial English Corpus contains texts relating to economics and finance, including leading financial magazines and newspapers.

=== Cambridge Academic English Corpus ===
The Cambridge Academic English Corpus contains written and spoken academic language at undergraduate and post-graduate level from a range of US and UK institutions, including lectures, seminars, student presentations, journals, essays and text books.

=== CANCODE ===
The Cambridge and Nottingham Corpus of Discourse in English (CANCODE) is a collection of spoken English recorded at hundreds of locations across the British Isles in a wide variety of situations (e.g. casual conversation, socialising, finding out information, and discussions). The CANCODE corpus is the result of a joint project between [[Cambridge University Press]] and the [[University of Nottingham]].

There are about five million words in the CANCODE corpus, and it's a very rich resource for researchers of spoken English.  However, the data does have some limitations.  Most people knew they were being recorded, and are chatting in informal situations such as while relaxing at home, with others of fairly equal social status.  This means the interactions are generally consensual and collaborative, so the corpus has minimal evidence of conflict or adversarial exchanges&lt;ref&gt;Carter (2004) Language and Creativity: The Art of Common Talk. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cambridge-Cornell Corpus of Spoken North American English ===
The Cambridge University Press/Cornell Corpus is a large collection of informal, highly interactive, multiparty conversations between family/friends in North America. The Cambridge-Cornell corpus is the result of a joint project between [[Cambridge University Press]] and [[Cornell University]].

=== CAMSNAE ===
The Cambridge Corpus of Spoken North American English (CAMSNAE) is a large collection of spoken American English. It includes recordings of people going about their everyday life – at work, at home with their families, going shopping, having meals, etc.

'''''Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand''''' is a non-fiction book about [[climate change denial]], coauthored by Haydn Washington and John Cook, with a foreword by [[Naomi Oreskes]]. Washington had a background in [[environmental science]] prior to authoring the work, and Cook was educated in [[physics]] and founded the website [[Skeptical Science]] which compiles [[peer review|peer-reviewed evidence]] of [[global warming]]. The book was first published in hardcover and paperback formats in 2011 by [[Earthscan]], a division of [[Routledge]].

The book presents an in-depth analysis and refutation of climate change denial, going over several arguments point-by-point and disproving them with [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] evidence from the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus for climate change]]. The authors assert that those denying climate change engage in tactics including [[cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]] data purported to support their specific viewpoints, and attacking the integrity of [[climate scientists]]. They use [[social science]] theory to examine the phenomenon of climate change denial in the wider public, and call this phenomenon a form of [[pathology]].

The book traces financial support for climate change denial to the [[fossil fuel]] industry, asserting these companies have attempted to influence [[public opinion]] on the matter. Washington and Cook write that politicians have a tendency to use [[weasel word]]s as part of a [[propaganda]] tactic through use of [[Spin (public relations)|spin]], as a way to deflect public interest away from climate change and remain passive on the issue. The authors conclude that if the public ceased engaging in denial, the problem of climate change could be realistically addressed.

For his research on the book, and efforts in communicating the essence of climate change science to the general public, John Cook won the 2011 [[Australian Museum]] [[Eureka Prize]] for Advancement of Climate Change Knowledge.&lt;ref name="honour" /&gt; ''Climate Change Denial'' received a positive reception in reviews from publications including: ''[[The Ecologist]]'',&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt; ''[[ECOS (CSIRO magazine)|ECOS]]'' magazine,&lt;ref name="considine" /&gt; [[academic journal]] ''Natures Sciences Sociétés'',&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; the journal ''Education'' published by the [[New South Wales Teachers Federation]],.&lt;ref name="kitson" /&gt; An article in ''[[The New American]]'' was critical, describing the labels of "deniers" and "denialists" as cruel and forms of [[character assassination]].&lt;ref name="jasper" /&gt;

''Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand'' presents a detailed analysis and refutation of climate change denial.&lt;ref name="considine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="castree"&gt;{{cite book|page=245|title=Making Sense of Nature|first=Noel |last=Castree|year=2013|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-0-415-54550-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6UptAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA245}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her [[foreword]] to the book, Naomi Oreskes writes that people fall victim to the phenomenon of denial due to feeling frightened.&lt;ref name="chandler"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jo|last=Chandler|accessdate=31 October 2015|url=http://www.theage.com.au/it-pro/forget-facts-its-personality-that-rules-reactions-to-climate-change-20110527-1f8dl|title=Forget facts, it's personality that rules reactions to climate change|work=[[The Age]]|date=28 May 2011|archivedate=31 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031032437/http://www.theage.com.au/it-pro/forget-facts-its-personality-that-rules-reactions-to-climate-change-20110527-1f8dl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book examines several arguments against global warming, and uses peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus to back-up rationale for disputing the validity of each argument.&lt;ref name="considine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="castree" /&gt; The methodology of those denying climate change is assessed, including: [[cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]] data purporting to support their specific viewpoints, maintaining a high bar for evidence of climate change by those denying it, and criticism of the values of climate scientists themselves.&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; The book puts forth an explanation why certain individuals, and the wider public, have a tendency to deny the scientific consensus for climate change.&lt;ref name="kitson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=31 October 2015|url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/nsw/2011/05/climate-change-discussion.html|title=Climate Change discussion|first=Chloe|last=Walker|date=17 May 2011|work=Afternoons with James Valentine|publisher=[[702 ABC Sydney]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814022313/http://blogs.abc.net.au/nsw/2011/05/climate-change-discussion.html|archivedate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors discuss the broader concept of [[denial]] using social science theory, noting its occurrence appears in society when individuals are frightened or ashamed of their actions.&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; They write that these motivations, when expanded from an individual to wider society, present themselves as a form of [[disease]].&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kitson" /&gt; The book identifies climate change denial itself as a pathology afflicting the culture of the planet.&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; The authors lament that an inverse relationship exists between an increasing scientific consensus regarding climate change, and a simultaneous increase in denial within the greater public about the same issue.&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt;

The book identifies a corporate underpinning influencing public opinion by way of companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry.&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel words as a form of spin and propaganda, in order to act as if they are going to do something about climate change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue.&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial&amp;nbsp;— within the wider public itself.&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; They argue that society enables denial of [[climate science]] through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus.&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:1 Australian Museum.JPG|thumb|Australian Museum in 2011]]
The book's coauthor John Cook won the 2011 Eureka Prize for Advancement of Climate Change Knowledge, awarded by the [[New South Wales]] Government as part of the Australian Museum Eureka Prizes, and was honoured for his role in communicating the essence of climate change science to the general public.&lt;ref name="honour"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2011/09/top-honour-uq%E2%80%99s-eureka-prize-winners|work=UQ News|publisher=[[University of Queensland]]|title=Top honour for UQ's Eureka Prize winners|accessdate=31 October 2015|date=7 September 2011|archivedate=22 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022225858/http://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2011/09/top-honour-uq%E2%80%99s-eureka-prize-winners}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eurekafinalist"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2011/08/eureka-moment-leading-climate-change-communicator|accessdate=31 October 2015|title=Eureka moment for leading climate change communicator|date=24 August 2011|work=UQ News|publisher=[[University of Queensland]]|archivedate=19 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019114542/http://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2011/08/eureka-moment-leading-climate-change-communicator}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director of the University of Queensland Global Change Institute, Professor [[Ove Hoegh-Guldberg (biologist)|Ove Hoegh-Guldberg]], cited Cook's research and authorship of ''Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand'' as the rationale behind him winning the award.&lt;ref name="eurekafinalist" /&gt;

''The Ecologist'' reviewed the book and described it as: "well researched and painstakingly footnoted".&lt;ref name="ecologist"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[The Ecologist]]|accessdate=31 October 2015|url=http://www.theecologist.org/reviews/books/885054/climate_change_denial.html|title=Climate Change Denial|first=Jeremy|last=Williams|date=12 May 2011|issn=0012-9631|oclc=263593196|archivedate=15 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915060448/http://www.theecologist.org/reviews/books/885054/climate_change_denial.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review concluded: ''Climate Change Denial'' is a wise and timely book.&amp;nbsp;... It deserves an audience".&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt; Writing for ''ECOS'' magazine, Mary-Lou Considine wrote that the book "dissects objections to the peer-reviewed science" in "forensic detail".&lt;ref name="considine" /&gt; Considine recommended the book for those who had previously visited the website Skeptical Science and subsequently wanted to learn more about the wider topic discussed on the site.&lt;ref name="considine" /&gt;

In a review of the book by the academic journal ''Natures Sciences Sociétés'', the authors' thesis was praised for its ability to bring reason to their analysis: "This book shows how we can break through denial, accept reality, and thus solve the climate crisis".&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; ''Natures Sciences Sociétés'' recommended the work for multiple stakeholders, concluding: "It will engage scientists, university students, climate change activists as well as the general public seeking to roll back denial and act".&lt;ref name="natures"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Natures Sciences Sociétés|title=Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand|date=October 2011|volume=19|issue=4|page=474|issn=1240-1307|accessdate=31 October 2015|via=[[EBSCO Host]]|subscription=yes|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/book-reviews/75040268/climate-change-denial-heads-sand|doi=10.1051/nss/2011153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janine Kitson reviewed the book for the journal ''Education'', a publication of the New South Wales Teachers Federation.&lt;ref name="kitson"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Education: Journal of the New South Wales Teachers Federation|publisher=[[New South Wales Teachers Federation]]|first=Janine|last=Kitson|issn=0013-1156|oclc=225337865|page=36|date=8 August 2011|title=Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kitson described the work as timely and important within the context of a need for the public to act before a [[point of no return]]: "This is a crucial book to read before runaway climate change is truly beyond our control".&lt;ref name="kitson" /&gt; Her review concluded: "One can only hope that this book will be read by climate deniers so we can start the challenging journey to an ecologically sustainable future".&lt;ref name="kitson" /&gt;

In ''The New American'', contributor William F. Jasper criticised the book's authors' characterization of those who engage in climate change denial as character assassination.&lt;ref name="jasper"&gt;{{cite news|issn=0885-6540|work=[[The New American]]|url=http://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/environment/item/15457-global-warming-consensus-cooking-the-books|accessdate=31 October 2015|first=William F.|last=Jasper|title=Global Warming 'Consensus': Cooking the Books|date=21 May 2013|archivedate=27 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150727001353/http://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/environment/item/15457-global-warming-consensus-cooking-the-books}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that the labels "deniers" and "denialists" were non-constructive and cruel.&lt;ref name="jasper" /&gt; Jasper disputed the book's thesis that individuals who disagreed with [[Attribution of recent climate change|anthropogenic global warming]] were organised and financed by the fossil fuel industry.&lt;ref name="jasper" /&gt;

It is located on a coastal site at northern [[San Diego Bay]], on the former grounds of the closed [[Naval Training Center San Diego|San Diego Naval Training Center]], now part of the [[Liberty Station]] redevelopment project in Point Loma.

==Research==
The Laboratory focuses research on environmental and ecological problems on the [[Southern California Bight]] coastline in [[southern California]],  caused by [[urbanization]] in the coastal environment at land-water interfaces, such as [[estuary|estuaries]].

===Current Research Projects===
*Coastal GIS Center
*Wetlands Restoration Center (Pacific Estuarine Research Lab)
*Coastal and Marine Ecology Group
*Beach Water Quality Center

===HPWREN===
Data is transferred back from the Laboratory via the [[High Performance Wireless Research and Education Network|High Performance Research and Education Network (HPWREN)]].

===Equipment===
*50,000 square foot Coastal Waters Laboratory
*10,000 square feet devoted to outdoor aquaria and a greenhouse
*Continuous flow seawater system from San Diego Bay
*Large hall for classes, lectures, and workshops on resource issues
*Boat maintenance and SCUBA diving facility
*Specialized analytical, research, and wet laboratories, including:
**Coastal Zone GIS Laboratory
**Virus and Pathogen Laboratory

==Coastal Zone Campus==
Adjacent to the CMIL laboratory complex is another research laboratory, operated by the Metropolitan Wastewater Department (MWWD) of the [[City of San Diego]], in order to consolidate marine monitoring and analytical operations. 

Together, this has created a “Coastal Zone Campus” on [[San Diego Bay]] to allow mutual access to and sharing of new and innovative research ideas and activities among federal regional, and local entities, and nationally known scientists and experts, in order to exchange information related to the coastal zone environment.

The '''Commonwealth of World Citizens''' (later named 'Mondcivitan Republic' after the [[Esperanto]]) was founded by [[Hugh J. Schonfield]], an associate of [[H.G. Wells]], in 1956. The organisation describes itself as  a '''servant-Nation'''.&lt;ref&gt;The politics of God Hugh Joseph Schonfield - 1970 "There shall be identical treatment of those outside the Commonwealth as of those within it, treatment that is founded on reverence for the human personality. 3. The Commonwealth of World Citizens shall ever promote and actively assist ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World citizenship and mundialism: a guide to the building of a ... - Page 23 John Charles de Villamar Roberts - 1999 "The Commonwealth of World Citizens offered itself as an example of a new "nation" devoted solely to serving humanity. Its founder, Dr. Hugh Schonfield, a distinguished Biblical scholar, had worked for world citizenship and mundialism ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

(2017) "A Life for Mankind - The Biography of Hugh Joseph Schonfield" - The Hugh &amp; Helene Schonfield World Service Trust {{ISBN|978 199 986 9106}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a biblical scholar, who was later best known for his book ''The Passover Plot.''&lt;ref&gt;No Sense of Obligation: Science and Religion in an Impersonal Universe - Page 141 Matt Young - 2001 "Hugh Schonfield was a New Testament scholar who was educated at King's College, London, and earned a doctorate in sacred literature at the University of Glasgow. He was a prolific author but received attention mostly for The Passover Plot..."&lt;/ref&gt; Schonfield first felt the need for an organisation for the service of all nations as far back as 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Alternative approaches to world government Hanna Newcombe - 1967 "The Commonwealth of World Citizens, or Mondcivitans , was founded long before [[Garry Davis]]. In 1938, Dr. Hugh Schonfield, distinguished British Jewish scholar and diplomat, conceived the civilized world's need for a new "independent and ...&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1938 to 1950 Schonfield examined various aspects of the project, including questions of international law.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Schonfield came up with the idea of a body of persons from different countries which would have relations with the governments of other countries, without that organisation holding any territory itself. When the [[United Nations]] was formed, Schonfield wrote to the [[Secretary-General]] and to all the states party to the charter of his desire to form his Mondcivitan Republic. {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In the summer of 1951, a General Assembly of the organisation's members was held in [[Paris]], which appointed a Secretariat as the acting administration with offices in [[London]]. By 1952 the organisation had members in 14 countries, by 1954 in 25 countries and by 1955 in 30 countries. The second General Assembly in 1953 set up a commission to draft the text of the constitution of the organisation. Following amendments at the third General Assembly in 1955, the organisation's provisional [[Constitution]] was approved for adoption. In the same year [[humanitarian]] activities were initiated by the creation of the World Service Trust as a specialised agency of the organisation.

===Ideals===
The organisation arose from the need felt by members throughout the world to give organic expression to the idea of the fundamental unity of the human race by developing a common way of life and government, which experimentally would be a preparation by example for a co-operative [[World community]] embracing all peoples.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The organisation was to consist of all its members at any given time, without regard for colour or ethnic origin. In its political expression it was a free and self-governing organisation and ''world community''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The new organisation expressed the goal of world unity and human fraternity. The idea was that the organisation should advocate for international reconciliation and the resolution of international problems and conflicts. The loyalty it demanded was higher than that given to any state, requiring in the individual full dedication to the principles and purposes of the new nation, yet at the initial stage without forfeiting state [[citizenship]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

For the members, state citizenship was to be always secondary to membership within the organisation. Any member was expected to be primarily concerned with the affairs and policies of the organisation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Taking part in war, aggression of oppression was strictly prohibited and the member was supposed to be prepared to suffer the penalties.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} All members were expected to live and abide by a set of seven principles:{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}
* No-one is an Enemy
* No-one is a Foreigner
* Service to All
* Complete Impartiality
* Work for Peace
* True [[Democracy]]
* Equity and Justice

==''The Republic''==
With members in 33 countries it was decided in 1956 that the ''Mondcivitan Republic'' should be proclaimed in being ''de facto'' and that all governments should be advised accordingly and furnished with a copy of the constitution.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} A Constituent Assembly of the organisation's members was convened at the [[Temple of Peace, Cardiff]], headquarters of the [[United Nations Association]] in [[Wales]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The organisation's constitution was adopted on August 29 and the flag of the organisation hoisted over the building.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} A council was elected to prepare the way for parliamentary government.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 1958 a [[democracy|democratic]] election was held giving opportunity to all members in the countries where they resided to elect deputies to the first parliament which met in [[Vienna]] in May 1959.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Up to this time the organisation had used the title, "Commonwealth of World Citizens" which was abandoned in favour of "The Mondcivitan Republic". Hugh Schonfield, the pioneer of the enterprise, was elected acting president and the organisation chose an executive committee headed by a young member, Donald Hanby  who was referred to as the ''prime minister''.

In 1963, the organisation held its second ''parliament''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The term of this body was to be for five years. In accordance with the constitution, a presidium of five was elected under the name of the Supreme Council, each member of which would hold the office of president for one year in turn.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Those elected, in the order of their presidency, were Frieda Bacon, Justo Priesto, Nguyen-Huu, [[Anthony Brooke]] and Hugh J. Schonfield, the last named to take office at the end of August 1967. The post of ''prime minister'' was relinquished and replaced under the constitution with that of ''commissioner-general'' and Donald Hanby was elected to that office.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

At this time, the [[International Arbitration League]], founded at the beginning of the 20th century by the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner, Sir [[William Randal Cremer]], decided that its work could best be continued by the ''Mondcivitan Republic'' and the two organisations fused.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The work of the World Service Trust continued and a housing agency, the Cremer Housing Association, was formed, which later provided new premises for use by the organisation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 1971, the provisional constitution was suspended to make way for formulating a full constitution.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} To enable the organisation to ensure the best means of governance, an executive council was appointed to take full responsibility for the organisation's affairs in the interim period.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} It was hoped that a full constitution and self-government could be achieved by 1975, but this did not happen.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Projects==
In 1972 Hugh Schonfield's book about the fundamental ideas behind the organisation, The ''Politics of God,'' was published and received much interest, particularly because it had been preceded by the best-selling [[The Passover Plot]], which had created much discussion and aroused interest in the concept of [[Messianism]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The Community school project was started as an experiment by the organisation's membership.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} It was intended to provide a viable alternative to the prevalent educational concepts, with primary aim to give each child freedom, experience, resources and love.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} It was believed that this should take place in, and be directly concerned with, the community as a whole, encouraging children to take an active interest in serving and changing the community for the betterment of the whole of mankind.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Various methods of achieving these aims were implemented.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The school was supported by donations from members and charged no fees.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Many of the children were "problem" children from the neighbourhood of the school who went on to lead productive lives.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==The World Service Trust==
The World Service Trust was founded in 1955 as a special agency of the organisation for the purpose of giving impartial aid to people and countries in circumstances of poverty, famine, disease and epidemics, as well as natural disasters.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The secondary organisation was also designed to assist education and improve standards of living.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 1990 the secondary organisation became a foundation and was renamed "The Hugh and Helene Schonfield World Service Trust".{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The Schonfields contributed to it financially. {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The organisation fell into decline following the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Its archives are now deposited with the [[Bishopsgate Institute]] in London.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}
Its activities became more centred in Germany as the community initiated by [[Wilhelm Haller]] felt a more decentralised and less bureaucratic approach was necessary. A new initiative was started in 2004 with the founding of the 'International Leadership and Business Society', intended to encourage the application of the original Mondcivitan principles in business and everyday life. The Hugh &amp; Helene Schonfield World Service Trust continued to work particularly with its responsibility for the archiving and publicising of the work of the late Hugh J. Schonfield and research into the concepts of Messianism, [[Humanitism]] and ''Servant-Nationhood'' and methods to find their practical realisation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 2014 a revival of the movement was started in an attempt to find a current interpretation. This has led to the establishment of a Facebook page. {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12596">{{Community}}

A '''community of place''' or '''place-based community''' is a [[community]] of people who are bound together because of ''where'' they reside, work, visit or otherwise spend a continuous portion of their time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|quote="The 'spatial community' is that which is defined by geography (e.g. municipal boundary, health region)".|vauthors=Ramsey D, Beesley KB|url=http://www.rrh.org.au/articles/subviewnew.asp?ArticleID=850|title='Perimeteritis' and rural health in Manitoba, Canada: perspectives from rural healthcare managers|journal=Rural and Remote Health (Internet) |volume=7|issue=4|page=850|year=2007|pmid=18081449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a community can be a [[neighborhood]], [[town]], [[coffeehouse]], [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]], [[gathering place]], [[public space]] or any other geographically specific place that a number of people share, have in common or visit frequently. A community offers many appealing features of a broader social relationship: Safety, familiarity, support and loyalties as well as appreciation. Appreciation that is founded on efforts and contribution to the community, rather than the efforts, rank or status of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aDMyfMqgdHEC|title=Community and the Politics of Place|last=Kemmis|first=Daniel|date=1992-01-01|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806124773|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in technology, transportation and communication have evolved the concept of place and the limits society once had in interactions with one another. With these advances, barriers have been lifted and distance is no longer such a great factor in anchoring the flow of people, goods or information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gieryn|first=Thomas F.|date=2000-01-01|title=A Space for Place in Sociology|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=26|pages=463–496|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.463|jstor=223453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variables of a community ==

When identifying what it is that makes a community, it is important to break it down and understand the components that sociologist have found that creates solidarity between the community and its members. German Sociologist and Philosopher Ferdinand Tönnies spoke of these components as evolutionary terms in his theoretical essay ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brint|first=Steven|date=March 2001|title=''Gemeinschaft'' Revisited: A Critique and Reconstruction of the Community Concept|url=http://www.asanet.org/images/members/docs/pdf/featured/soth125.pdf|journal=Sociological Theory|doi=10.1111/0735-2751.00125|pmid=|publisher=American Sociological Association|volume=19|pages=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (translated to Community and Society). ''Gemeinschaft'' would represent the childhood of humanity where as ''Gesellschaft'' would represent the maturity of humanity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ''Gemeinschaft'' and ''Gesellschaft'' ===

''[[Gemeinschaft]]'' or community is smaller in number of members; its members usually share a common way of life (occupation/daily activities), common beliefs. Members have frequent interaction with one another as well as a tie of emotional bonds and distance from centers of power.

''[[Gesellschaft]]'' or society is much larger in terms of its members. Contrary to ''Gemeinschaft'', members do not share the same ways of life or beliefs. Members rarely interact with one another and have loose connections to each other. As well as being closer to establishments of power and regulated competitiveness among its members. This type of bond is most often found in urban communities that follow specific systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sharing the Cost and Benefits of Resource Activity|last=Barrera-Hernández|first=Lila|publisher=UOP Oxford|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Defining "place" ===
A "place" should be thought of as a geographic location, its material form and the investments of meaning and value; the combination of these concepts make a "place" a place. Geographic location is important because this is used to identify what and where a place is. This concept gives individuals a sense of direction and reference to location. The material form is physicality of the place, whether it be artificially made like a building belonging to an institution or establishment or a natural from, such as a well known land mass. Finally, the meanings and value of place is the shared meaning or psych of a location. For example, the understanding of an area or neighborhood to reflect some historic value, prestigious families, Utopian or a dangerous.

A place is not space; Space can be though of distance, size, direction- usually descriptions of geometric items. Space however can become a place when filled with things spoken of earlier, such as: Cultural practices, things, values and of course people. People of a place are usually influenced or are at least conscious of the strong and unique influential forces a place passes onto its people. Every place will exhibit its own unique and independent force of influence that consequently generates social life.

If one of the three defining features (location, material form and meaningfulness) is analyzed as having greater importance than another defining feature, the identity and definition of place is quash. The focus, favoritism or forgotten of any key feature (when defining place) prevents social construction. A place is more than a variable of social life, it is in fact what molds together social life. Creating solidarity, cohesion to form what is social life. Place often becomes a lens people use to see life through. It impacts an individuals evaluation of others and their identity, political position and practices as well as a tool to measure one's own life.

=== Constructing place ===
The modern globalized world has had impact on the construction of place and the relationship among different places. Politicians, financial establishments, engineers and architects are just a few of the occupations we can look at to break down the construction of place. When looking at the architecture of a place, we are looking at its material form. This material, these structures an architect produces are symbols of the experiences, styles and cultural influence a place had or has on the individual. In fact the architect could as well construct structures to celebrate the history of an area, the achievements of a hero or heroine and compliment the surrounding area the structure will be built in. By doing so, the architect is creating a look or feel that people can associate with the area.

[[Globalization]] as well had impact on the social identity of a community, creating competition among all members of the globalized world. For example, larger "major cities" tend to be proud of its identity it has generated and will continue to pursue this identity. Inspiring smaller cities to pursue this identity as well or one of a new face. In this light, politicians and media play a role in constructing the use of land in a geographic area. Cities are built and develop cultural meaning that conform with economic interests.

People inhabiting a place as well help with validity and creation of place. Individuals assimilate the meaningfulness, functionality, name and identity of a space – especially the more in contact they are with the area. The homogeneity of design and architecture of a given neighborhood allows members to identify the class of people as well as name of the area. Quite similar to how people address personal occupation by uniform, the sameness of a given area works in a similar fashion. This same reasoning occurs with structures that are unique; its individuality stands out so much, people assign meaning and identity to it. As stated before, place is not only conceptualized as a location but by the meanings, functionality and qualities people assign to the social stuff that are there. "Place-Stratification" is a consequence of such identity creation: public or private, rich or poor, black or white, safe or dangerous, etc.

The same conceptualization is used on a larger scale; take nationalism or continents for example. Africa and Europe are not divided by physical features such as bodies of water or "real" borders. Instead they are divided among Geo-political borders that are impacted by cultural beliefs, social practices and overall homogeneity. Although these borders are created through personal whim the consequences of there actions on other place's are very real. For example, the impacts that imperialism and colonization had on the land and life-style of Natives.

== Functions of place ==
A place stabilizes social life and gives durability to social structures, creates [[Social stratification|social hierarchies]] and [[social network|network]]s as well as solidarity among its members through frequent face to face interactions, cultural norms, shared identities, memories and values.

However, there are two arguments made when creating community of place: engagement and estrangement. 
* Engagement: Sophistication, diversity, tolerance, public participation, integration, network formation, freedom and civil negotiation.  
* Estrangement: Anonymity, detachment, privatization, formal social controls, individualism, disconnection, isolation, lack of community or solidarity.

=== Stratification ===
Social arenas that are inviting and successfully make visitors feel comfortable – like, but not limited to, parks, libraries, and plazas – help to reinforce engagement among community members. These social arenas bring together a variety of different people and allow them to communicate, experience and learn differences of one another. Just as structures can be built to reinforce solidarity and engagement, the construction of social arenas can as well develop estrangement. Take neighborhoods that are closed off by gates or are further in distance from city centers, where access is limited by travelling at high speeds to and from in a private vehicle. Invisible barriers such as price of property and proximity to stores, workplaces and civic centers work as well as agents of social stratification – usually based on things such as race, ethnicity and/or gender.

=== Collective action ===
Place can work as a catalyst for [[collective action]] – social movements, protests, formation of labor unions, etc. As stated before, the solidarity that is created among individuals, the shared experiences and loyalty to members help with the formation of these movements. Researchers and their efforts have seen this phenomenon occur across multiple social movements and have dissected it so much so, they have pinpointed how proximity and solidarity has effected the response of collective action. The revolt of peasants in the Ottoman Empire during the seventeenth century is a good example of proximity and its effects of cohesion. Villages that were further from centers of political power were more likely to rally than elitist or people that were so far they were essentially isolated from political centers.

Loyalty, sentimental and emotional bonds are created between people as place brings them together. The attachment begins through biographical experiences: traumatic, fulfilling, even secret events that happen to individuals personally at that place. Other research explain that attachment is developed through proximity and shared cultural process like living in the same building and emotional meanings of hanging out and having a good time in a local coffee shop. Place attachment creates a sense of security and well-being as well as identifying oneself to a group and memories.

=== Norms ===
Place inscribes [[cultural norm]]s, [[Ethics|ethical]] beliefs and values in its members as well as shapes ideology around what is considered deviant or criminal behavior. There are debates on whether crime rates are affected by environment, demographic or economic variables.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3198">'''Dacryphilia''' (also known as '''dacrylagnia''') is a form of [[paraphilia]] in which one is [[sexual arousal|aroused]] by tears or sobbing.&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;{{cite book |last= Holmes |first= Ronald M. |title= Sex Crimes: Patterns and Behavior |publisher= Sage Publications |location= Thousand Oaks |isbn= 0-7619-2417-5 |oclc= 48883594 |page= ''p''. 244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | page=373 |title=Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unususal Sexual Practices|first=Anil|last=Aggrawal|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|year=2009|ISBN=978-1-4200-4308-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term covers all forms of pleasure from the tears of others. The arousal is achieved when viewing a person in emotional distress. It carries the theme where a person (often a [[Top and bottom in sex and BDSM|Top]] in a [[BDSM]] relationship) induces another (the bottom) to cry, or otherwise show a strong emotion.

== BDSM ==
Dacryphilia may be a form of humiliation in the 'pain/restriction/servitude/humiliation' spectrum of BDSM; for example, a dominant may verbally abuse the submissive in order to elicit a tearful response. In contrast, a Dominant may instead physically torture the submissive to draw tears in a pain scene. In this way, dacryphilia is a form of [[wikt:sadism|sadism]]. A Sensual Dom or [[dominatrix]] may instead choose to elicit tears by making the Sub feel safe enough to become emotionally vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kinkly.com/definition/6750/sensual-domination|title=Sensual Domination|publisher=Kinkly|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychological aspects of dacryphilia are that the causative entity displays the power to control the psychological response from the receiver. This form of power-play therefore brings pleasure, and for some, sexual arousal. Passive dacryphilia involves a third party who also achieves pleasure in watching someone in emotional distress, usually caused by the scening dominant, though the reason does not restrict the pleasure – a person may enjoy the tears of others, whatever the cause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informedconsent.co.uk/dictionary/Dacryphilia/ BDSM Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-BDSM dacryphilia ==

Dacryphilia is not limited to BDSM and may be experienced by those who do not consider themselves a Dom or Sub. They may be aroused when their partner cries during a movie or from the normal emotional vulnerability and strong feelings of love that may make a partner cry during intercourse. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Can Crying Be Sexually Arousing? A brief look at dacryphilia|date=14 January 2016|author= Mark D. Griffiths|work=Psychology Today|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-excess/201601/can-crying-be-sexually-arousing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other usage ==
Dacryphilia is sometimes used to express the pleasure experienced through one's own tears, often as an emotional release.

A dacryphiliac is someone who gets sexually aroused from watching other people cry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4220">A '''Diploma of Journalism''' (or '''Diploma in Journalism''') is an [[Academic degree|academic qualification]] in [[journalism]] issued by a university or college.

The diploma is generally issued after one year of study. As is common with [[diploma]]s in general, diplomas in journalism are often more practical or applied than a course leading to a [[bachelor's]] or [[master's degree]] in journalism. Some universities offer [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] Diplomas of Journalism.

Historically, the emergence of journalism diplomas reflected the somewhat condescending view of journalism education which emerged in Britain and British Commonwealth countries, unlike the United States. Briggs and Burke point out that, despite the emergence of university degree programs in the United States from the late 19th century, British universities were uninterested in formal [[journalism education]], and entered the field only at sub-degree level: "between 1919 and 1939 the only University Diploma for Journalism in Britain was offered at London University".&lt;ref&gt;Briggs &amp; Burke, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s and 1930s in Australia, four universities started journalism diploma courses as sub-degree programs, but none of the courses survived in this form. (They have since emerged as degree courses.)&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick&lt;/ref&gt; 

More recently, there has been debate about comparisons between diploma and degree programs in journalism, with advocates of diplomas arguing that the shorter courses, with their lesser emphasis on theory, are often more relevant to industry needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamecareerguide.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1354] [http://www.studyconnect.com/forums/showthread.php?t=4443]&lt;/ref&gt; Degree courses, however, offer deeper theoretical exposure and greater analysis of ethical and legal issues.

In New Zealand, the media industry has developed a national diploma of journalism, establishing a curriculum which is followed by accredited training institutions, including universities and colleges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalismtraining.co.nz/schools.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Britain National Council for the Training of Journalists offers certificate courses and accredits colleges and universities offering diplomas and degrees in journalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nctj.com/index.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another development has been the specialist diploma in a particular field of journalism, such as sports journalism, science journalism or business journalism, generally taught at postgraduate level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nml.ru.ac.za/blog/reg-rumney/2008/09/02/what-keynes-can-teach-editors-about-journalism-education.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

English-language institutions offering the Diploma of Journalism are mainly in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries.

'''Epigraphy''' ({{lang-grc|ἐπιγραφή}}, "inscription") is the study of inscriptions or epigraphs as [[writing]]; it is the science of identifying [[grapheme]]s, clarifying their meanings, classifying their uses according to dates and cultural contexts, and drawing conclusions about the writing and the writers. Specifically excluded from epigraphy are the historical significance of an epigraph as a [[document]] and the artistic value of a [[literature|literary]] composition.

A person using the methods of epigraphy is called an ''epigrapher'' or ''epigraphist''. For example, the [[Behistun inscription]] is an official [[document]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] engraved on native rock at a location in [[Iran]]. Epigraphists are responsible for reconstructing, translating, and dating the trilingual inscription and finding any relevant circumstances. It is the work of [[historian]]s, however, to determine and interpret the events recorded by the inscription as document. Often, epigraphy and history are competences practised by the same person.

An epigraph is any sort of text, from a single grapheme (such as marks on a pot that abbreviate the name of the merchant who shipped commodities in the pot) to a lengthy document (such as a treatise, a work of literature, or a [[hagiography|hagiographic]] prescription). Epigraphy overlaps other competences such as [[numismatics]] or [[palaeography]]. When compared to books, most inscriptions are short. The media and the forms of the graphemes are diverse: [[engraving]]s in stone or metal, scratches on rock, impressions in wax, [[Repoussé and chasing|embossing]] on cast metal, [[cameo (carving)|cameo]] or [[Intaglio (jewellery)|intaglio]] on precious stones, painting on [[ceramic]] or in [[fresco]]. Typically the material is durable, but the durability might be an accident of circumstance, such as the baking of a [[clay tablet]] in a conflagration.

The study of ancient [[handwriting]], usually in ink, is a separate field, [[palaeography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://people.umass.edu/eng3/fcd/documents/Brown_WhatIsPalaeography.pdf |title=What is Palaeography? |first=Julian |last=Brown |access-date=21 September 2018 |publisher=[[UMassAmherst]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of the writing, the subject of epigraphy, is a matter quite separate from the nature of the text, which is studied in itself. Texts inscribed in stone are usually for public view and so they are essentially different from the written texts of each culture.  Not all inscribed texts are public, however: in [[Mycenaean Greece]] the deciphered texts of "[[Linear B]]" were revealed to be largely used for economic and administrative record keeping. Informal inscribed texts are "[[Graffito (archaeology)|graffiti]]" in its original sense.

==History==
[[File:Prüfeninger Weiheinschrift. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|The high medieval [[Prüfening dedicatory inscription]], composed in [[Latin]] and stamped in [[Roman square capitals]]]]

The science of epigraphy has been developing steadily since the 16th century. Principles of epigraphy vary culture by culture, and the infant science in European hands concentrated on Latin inscriptions at first. Individual contributions have been made by epigraphers such as [[Georg Fabricius]] (1516–1571); [[Stefano Antonio Morcelli]] (1737–1822); [[August Wilhelm Zumpt]] (1815–1877); [[Theodor Mommsen]] (1817–1903); [[Emil Hübner]] (1834–1901); [[Franz Cumont]] (1868–1947); [[Louis Robert (historian)|Louis Robert]] (1904–1985).

The ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'', begun by Mommsen and other scholars, has been published in Berlin since 1863, with wartime interruptions. It is the largest and most extensive collection of Latin inscriptions. New [[Book|fascicles]] are still produced as the recovery of inscriptions continues. The ''Corpus'' is arranged geographically: all inscriptions from Rome are contained in volume 6. This volume has the greatest number of inscriptions; volume 6, part 8, fascicle 3 was just recently published (2000). Specialists depend on such on-going series of volumes in which newly discovered inscriptions are published, often in Latin, not unlike the biologists' ''[[Zoological Record]]''— the raw material of history.

Greek epigraphy has unfolded in the hands of a different team, with different [[text corpus|corpora]]. There are two. The first is ''Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum'' of which four volumes came out, again at Berlin, 1825-1877. This marked a first attempt at a comprehensive publication of Greek inscriptions copied from all over the Greek-speaking world. Only advanced students still consult it, for better editions of the texts have superseded it. The second, modern corpus is ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]'' arranged geographically under categories: decrees, catalogues, honorary titles, funeral inscriptions, various, all presented in Latin, to preserve the international neutrality of the field of [[classics]].

Other such series include the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Etruscarum]]'' (Etruscan inscriptions), ''Corpus Inscriptionum Crucesignatorum Terrae Sanctae'' (Crusaders' inscriptions), ''Corpus Inscriptionum Insularum Celticarum'' (Celtic inscriptions), ''Corpus Inscriptionum Iranicarum'' (Iranian inscriptions), "Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia" and "Royal Inscriptions of the Neo-Assyrian Period" (Sumerian and Akkadian inscriptions) and so forth.

Egyptian hieroglyphs were solved using the [[Rosetta Stone]], which was a multilingual stele in Classical Greek, Demotic Egyptian and Classical Egyptian hieroglyphs. The work was done by the French scholar, [[Jean-François Champollion]], and the British scientist [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]].

The interpretation of [[Maya hieroglyphs]] was lost as a result of the Spanish Conquest of Central America. However, recent work by Maya epigraphers and linguists has yielded a considerable amount of information on this complex writing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael D.

====Materials====
Inscriptions were commonly incised on stone, marble, metal, [[terracotta]], or wood (though this last material has hardly ever survived, except in [[Egypt]]). In Egypt and [[Mesopotamia]] hard stones were frequently used for the purpose, and the inscriptions are therefore well preserved and easy to read. In [[Greece]] the favourite material, especially in [[Athens]], was white marble, which takes an admirably clear lettering, but is liable to weathering of the surface if exposed, and to wear if rebuilt into pavements or similar structures. Many other kinds of stone, both hard and soft, were often used, especially crystalline [[limestone]]s, which do not easily take a smooth surface, and which, therefore, are often difficult to decipher, owing to accidental marks or roughness of the material.&lt;ref name="EBr1"&gt;The following sections are based on specialist work consulted from the following sources: {{aut|[[Ernest Arthur Gardner]]}}'s article on "Epigraphy and Inscriptions", in Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

The metal most commonly used for inscriptions was [[bronze]]: flat tablets of this were often made for affixing to the walls of temples and other buildings. Occasionally such tablets were made of [[silver]] or [[gold]]; and inscriptions were often incised on vessels made of any of these metals. Inscriptions on metal were nearly always incised, not cast. An important class of inscriptions are the legends on coins; these were struck from the [[die (manufacturing)|die]]. (cf. [[numismatics]].) Clay was very extensively used for inscriptions in Mesopotamia and in [[Crete]]. In this case the symbols were incised or impressed on specially prepared tablets when the clay was soft, and it was subsequently hardened by fire. In Greece, many inscriptions on vases were painted before firing, in that case often having reference to the scenes represented, or incised after firing; potsherds (''[[ostraka]]'') were often used as a cheap writing material. Inscriptions were also often impressed from a mould upon wet clay before firing, in the case of tiles, [[amphora]] handles, etc., and in these cases often supply valuable information as to the buildings to which they belong or the place from which they took their origin.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

The ''tools'' used for making inscriptions varied with the material; most of them were some kind of [[chisel]], usually with a square blade; early inscriptions were sometimes made on hard rock by successive blows with a [[punch (tool)|punch]] or pointed [[hammer]]. Sometimes a circular punch was used for '''''O''''' or a letter of which ''O'' formed a part.

====Styles of cutting====
Early inscriptions, which are often amateur work, are frequently very irregular in their cutting. But in almost all examples of later work, the inscriptions are evidently cut by professionals, and there are definite styles and methods belonging to various places and periods. In Egypt, for instance, the [[hieroglyphs]] are carefully and delicately cut in early times, and in later periods become more careless and conventional. In Greece, the best work was done in the 5th and 4th centuries BC in Athens; the letters were all exact and regular in shape, with no adventitious ornaments, and were, especially in the 5th century, usually exactly aligned with the letters above and below, as well as those on each side. At that time all the strokes were made of equal thickness, but in the 4th century BC and later there came in the custom of holding the chisel obliquely to the surface, thus producing a wedge-shaped stroke. A similar custom in Mesopotamia gave rise to the so-called ''[[cuneiform]]'' system. On metal inscriptions in Greece this same effect appears earlier than stone or marble. In the 3rd century and later it becomes common to introduce ''[[Apex (diacritic)|apices]]'' or ornamental ends to the strokes, a custom which prevails to the present day in our ordinary capital letters. The custom of making different strokes and different parts of curves of varying thickness became common in [[Latin Inscriptions|Roman inscriptions]], which developed a monumental style of their own, varying from period to period. Inscriptions can often be approximately dated by the style of the cutting as well as by the shapes of the letters; skill in doing this can only be acquired by a careful and minute study of originals and facsimiles. (cf. [[dating methodologies in archaeology]].)

Inscriptions vary greatly in size according to the position where they were intended to be read, their purpose, and the skill of the cutter. Some inscriptions are of great length, the longest, a statement of accounts of the temple at [[Delos]], under Athenian administration, being nearly half as long as a book of [[Thucydides]]; and many other inscriptions approach this in length.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Symbols and forms of writing===
{{SpecialChars}}
{{see also|History of writing}}
Most of the forms of writing known to us originated in some system of picture-writing (cf. also [[pictography]], which developed into a hieroglyphic system. Such systems appear to have originated independently in different parts of the world — in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Crete]], among the [[Hittites]] and in [[China]] and [[Americas|America]]. The evidence for all of these is mainly to be found in inscriptions. The development from [[Ideographs]] (or direct representation of an object or idea) to symbols of phonetic value, and so to [[syllabaries]] or alphabets, took place in many different systems to various degrees. But the first people to invent a completely alphabetic system of writing were the [[Phoenicians]], from whom the [[Greeks]] borrowed (some scholars believe, but with no proving) it with certain modifications and improvements. From the Greeks was derived the [[Latin language|Latin]], and from the two all the alphabets of European peoples. It is still a matter of dispute whether the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] was derived from the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]].

[[File:Rökstenen 1.JPG|thumb|An inscription using [[cipher runes]], the [[Elder Futhark]], and the [[Younger Futhark]], on the 9th-century [[Rök Runestone]] in Sweden]]
The hieroglyphic symbols naturally tended to be conventionalised and simplified for convenience of cutting, in accordance with the materials and tools employed. In many cases they developed from a pictorial to a linear form. It is possible that some of these linear forms may not be derived from hieroglyphs, but from purely conventional geometrical forms. such as widely used at all periods and places as owners' or [[Stone mason|masons]]' marks. The tendency of linear forms to become wedge-shaped is most conspicuous in [[cuneiform]], but as has been noticed, the same tendency occurs in Greek inscriptions incised on bronze.

In the north of [[Europe]] the [[Ogham]] [[Ogham inscription|inscriptions]] are alphabetic, and are apparently an independent invention on arbitrary lines, like the [[Morse code]]; but [[Runes]], which were extensively used in the same region, are derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] or the [[Latin alphabet]]s.

In most alphabetic systems there are also found in inscriptions certain symbols which are not strictly alphabetic or phonetic in character. The commonest of these are the various systems of numerals that are used in different times and places. It is impossible here to give any full description of these different systems; but a brief account may be given of the principles underlying them. Most of them are based upon a [[decimal|decimal system]], doubtless owing to the habit of counting on the fingers. In some cases the symbols are simple and obvious, as in the Cretan script, where circles (or ''rhombi''), dots and lines are used for hundreds, tens and units, each being repeated as often as necessary; and a similar system for the lower denominations is used at [[Epidaurus]] in the 4th century BC. In [[Athens]] the usual system was to indicate each denomination by its initial, '''M''' for Μύριοι (10,000), '''X''' for χίλιοι (1,000), '''H''' for εκατόν (100), '''Δ''' for δέκα (10), '''π''' for πεντε (5) and '''I''' for units. The other Greek system followed that derived from the Phoenicians, using the letters of the alphabet in their conventional order from one to nine, 10 to 90 and 100 to 900; in this arrangement obsolete letters were retained in their original places so as to give the requisite number of 27 symbols. The [[Roman numeral|Roman]] system of numerals — M, D, C, L, X, V, I (for 1,000, 500, 100, 50, 10, 5 and 1) is generally supposed to have arisen from the adaptation of those symbols in the Greek alphabet which the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] did not want; an alternative theory is that it is simplified from a series of [[ideograph]]s representing the spread hand, the fingers and so on.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

[[File:Crete - law of Gortyn - boustrophedon.JPG|thumb&lt;!--autosize to fit handheld devices--&gt;|left|Ancient Greek [[boustrophedon]] inscription, [[Gortyn code]], Crete, 5th century BC]]

Apart from numerals, the use of initials in the place of complete words was not common in early times. It became, however, very frequent in Roman inscriptions, which sometimes are made up almost entirely of such abbreviations and can only be understood by those familiar with the formulae. A list of the commonest of these will be found under [[list of classical abbreviations]]. [[Compendia]] or [[monogram]]s also occur in later Greek and Roman times, and become very common and very difficult to interpret in early [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Byzantine]] inscriptions.

Some kind of punctuation is often found in inscriptions of all kinds. In Greek inscriptions a vertical line or a dot, or dots, sometimes indicates the separation between sentences or words, but words are seldom separated by spaces as in modern printing, so that the text is continuous and no division of words exists.This is particularly the case with Greek inscriptions of the best period. In Roman inscriptions it was usual to separate the words by dots. In certain inscriptions a cross ([[File:Greek cross.svg|15px]]) was used to indicate the beginning of an inscription, especially when its direction was erratic. Christian inscriptions sometimes begin with a cross, which doubtless had a symbolic meaning; and a leaf or other device was often placed at the end.

The direction of the writing varies greatly in different places and times. The letters or symbols may be arranged vertically below one another, and read from top to bottom, or horizontally, either from right to left or from left to right; they may also be arranged in a kind of pattern — in which case their order may be indeterminate, or in a wandering or curved line, or left to right and right to left alternately (''[[boustrophedon]]'', or as an [[ox]] in [[ploughing]]). Most [[Semitic alphabets]], including Phoenician, read from right to left; and the earliest Greek inscriptions follow the same direction. But the direction from left to right became regular in Greece after the 6th century BC, and consequently is adopted by the Romans and in all European systems. The individual letters or symbols usually face in the same direction as the writing, as a whole.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Position or place===
[[File:Roman - Funeral Stele - Walters 2316 - Three Quarter.jpg|thumb|Roman marble funeral [[stele]] with inscription: "CIL VI 23414: D(is) M(anibus) / M(arco) Ogulnio / Iusto filio / pientissimo / vix(it) ann(os) XV mens(es) II d(ies) XXII / M(arcus) Ogulnius / Iustus pater / et sibi fecit" - 1st century AD]]
The position or place of inscriptions depends greatly upon their purpose or intention. When they have a direct relation to the sculptures, reliefs or paintings with which they are associated, they often form a kind of pattern to fill the background or vacant spaces between the figures; but sometimes, especially in Mesopotamian statues or reliefs, they are cut right across the figures without any regard to the artistic effect. In late Greek or Roman work it is usual to cut any inscription relative to a statue or relief upon the basis on which this is mounted; but short inscriptions such as dedications or artists' signatures are often placed in some inconspicuous position upon the work itself. In the case of painted vases, the inscriptions relative to the subject represented are usually painted; but dedications and other inscriptions are often incised after the vase has been fired.

In Egypt, inscriptions were often inscribed or painted upon inner walls of tombs, whether they referred to religious belief or ritual, or to the honours and possessions of the deceased; they were intended for his benefit and convenience rather than for the information of others, so as to perpetuate his familiar surroundings, not to make him live in the memory of his successors. The information which we derive from such inscriptions is invaluable to us; but such was not the intention with which they were made. On the other hand, inscriptions which were intended to be seen by the public and to perpetuate a record of events, or to supply useful information, were usually placed in places of common resort, above all in temples and sacred precincts. Sometimes they were cut on convenient rock faces, sometimes upon the walls of temples or other buildings. Most frequently the slabs of marble (''[[stelae]]''), stone metal or other material upon which the inscriptions were incised were set up in convenient positions to be read, in any places of public resort. This was the method of publication of all laws, decrees and official notices, of treaties and contracts, of honours to officials or private citizens, of religious dedications and prescriptions of ritual. Inscribed [[tombstone]]s were set up over graves, which were usually placed along the chief roads leading out of a town, the most familiar example being the sacred way from Athens to [[Eleusis]]. Inscriptions commemorative of victories or other great events were only in exceptional cases erected upon the spot; more often such memorials were set up in some great religious centre such as [[Delphi]] or [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. But boundary stones were necessarily placed on the line which they defined.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Chief periods and nationalities===
[[File:Cypriot syllabic inscription 600-500BC.jpg|thumb]]
The study of inscriptions supplies an important contribution to the history of many lands and peoples. In some cases, as in Egypt and Mesopotamia, it forms almost the only source of information in the absence of literary records; in others, as in Greece and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], it offers a most valuable supplement and comment to what is otherwise recorded.

Both Egyptian and Mesopotamian inscriptions go back to an extremely early date; it is at present uncertain which is the earlier, but both show, before 3500 BC and possibly much earlier, a complete, organised system of writing which implies many centuries of development behind it. The Egyptian hieroglyphic system, as used in inscriptions, continued without any essential change of character until Roman times, though various systems of [[hieratic]] modification were used at different times. On the famous [[Rosetta Stone]], in the [[British Museum]], which first gave the clue to the interpretation of Egyptian writing, hieroglyphic, hieratic and Greek versions of the same decree are given side by side. Its date is 195 BC. The Mesopotamian linear symbols developed mainly for technical reasons, into a wedge-shaped or cuneiform system, which was adopted in modified forms and applied to different languages through some thousands of years, [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]], [[Assyria]]n and [[Old Persian|Persian]], until it was superseded, after the conquests of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], by Greek. An independent hieroglyphic system, which also developed into various linear scripts, existed in Crete during the [[Middle Minoan|Middle]] and [[Late Minoan]] periods, from about 3000, probably, to the fall of [[Knossos]], about 1500 BC. The Hittite hieroglyphs correspond to the period of the Hittite empire in northern [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and [[Asia Minor]] from about 2000 to 800 BC; from it, according to one theory, arose the [[Cypriot syllabary]], which continued in use until the 4th century BC or later.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

The earliest Phoenician inscriptions known date from about the 10th century BC, and the alphabet remained in use down to the 3rd century BC. Some believe this  was modified and adopted by the Greeks at an uncertain date; the earliest Greek inscriptions are generally dated in the 7th century BC.

In early times each Greek State had its own alphabet; but in the year 403 BC (the [[archon]]ship of [[Eucleides]]) the [[Ionic Greek|Ionian alphabet]], which is the one used now for Greek capital letters, was officially adopted by [[Athens]], and soon became universal in Greece. From the various Greek alphabets the different local [[Italian alphabet]]s, including the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], were derived with various modifications. The [[Roman alphabet]] was among these, being based on the [[Archaic Greek alphabets|alphabet]] of [[Caere]], a [[Chalcis|Chalcidian]] colony. There are a few very early Roman inscriptions; but they do not become common until the 3rd century BC; from that time the letters took much the same forms as they preserve to the present day.

The custom of putting inscriptions in Greek and in Latin on buildings and other monuments continued through [[medieval]] times, and is still customary, classical forms being frequently imitated. The latest dated inscription in the ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae|Greek Corpus]]'' records the building of a bridge in [[Sicily]] in AD 1121. The series of Byzantine inscriptions continues practically without interruption to the present day; and Latin retains its use as a universal language in religious, public and private inscriptions.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Methods of dating===
{{main article|Dating methodologies in archaeology}}
It is often possible to date an inscription approximately by the style of the lettering, or even by the alphabet used. Thus at Athens the [[Ionic alphabet]] was adopted in place of the early [[Attic Greek|Attic alphabet]] in the archonship of [[Eucleides]], 403 BC, according to a decree proposed by [[Archinus]].{{r|fragment}} But the change was already in process in private inscriptions, and even in official documents Ionic forms are sometimes found earlier. Inscriptions are dated in various ways, mostly by giving the name of a king, magistrate or priest. In the case of kings, they only give an approximate date, unless the year of his reign is given also. But in the case of most independent cities, the date is given by the name of an annual magistrate, and thus the year is precisely indicated. At Athens, the name used was that of the [[Eponymous]] [[Archon]], and as an almost complete list of these has been drawn up from inscriptions and other sources, this means of dating is quite satisfactory. The custom of dating by [[Olympiads]], which is familiar to us from later Greek and Roman writers, was rarely used in early Greece, except in connection with athletic victories. Many inscriptions are dated from various local eras, often based upon historical events, such as the foundation of a town or festival, the organisation of a province, or even a visit of an [[emperor]]. The number of these eras in later times, especially in Asia Minor, becomes very bewildering. In Attic decrees, and some others, it was also usual to give the day of the month.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

In Greek inscription of the Roman period the year of the emperor is defined by the number of his [[consulate]], or other indications or titles, as in the corresponding Latin inscriptions. In later times, the dating is commonly by "Indiction"; but as this only gives the number of the year within the 15-year period, but leaves that period undefined, such dating is very inconvenient except for merely temporary use. In the [[Eastern Empire]] the date from the creation of the world (5509 BC) is sometimes given; but the date of the Christian era is hardly ever used.

===Purpose of inscriptions===
Inscriptions may be roughly divided into two main classes: those in which the inscription was subservient to the use or purpose of the object on which it was inscribed, or at any rate had a direct relation to that object — for example, the name of the owner or the record of dedication to a god — and those in which the inscription existed independently for its own sake, or for the sake of the information which it recorded, and the object on which it was inscribed was either made for the purpose, as a slab of marble or plate of bronze, or was made use of, as in the case of a convenient wall or the surface of a rock, or even a [[potsherd]]. The walls of buildings are often covered with such inscriptions, especially if they are in a conspicuous or convenient position, and so offer an obvious means of publicity.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

For us, accustomed as we are to a vast mass of books, newspapers and other printed or digital documents, it is difficult to realise the extensive use and great convenience assigned to inscriptions in ancient times. Not only were public announcements of all sorts, such as we should make known by [[advertisements]] or [[posters]], thus placed before the public, but all kinds of records and enactments — [[codes of law]] and political decrees; regulations for all matters, civil and religious; accounts and contracts, public and private; treaties between states; records of public and private benefactions and dedications, and all matters of administration; honours to the living and to the memory of the dead. Many of these were intended to preserve for all time the records which they contained; but others must have been of only temporary interest. It seems, therefore, the more remarkable that they should have been incised on permanent material such as bronze, marble or stone — and incised in the first instance, with a care and perfection of technique which have led to their survival to the present day, so as to preserve for us invaluable evidence as to the life and institutions of the people who made them. Temporary and permanent value are therefore often combined in the same inscription. For instance, any Athenian citizen, visiting the [[Acropolis]] or the [[Agora]], could satisfy themselves at first hand as to treaties or decrees of the people, public accounts or state income and expenditure. And at the same time these documents preserved for all time much history, both social and political.&lt;ref name=InternationalDictionary&gt;{{cite book |author1=Trudy, Robert |author2=Sharon, Ring |author3=Salkin, Boda |year=1996 |title=International Dictionary of Historic Places: Southern Europe |location= |publisher=Routledge |pages= 66 |isbn=978-1-884964-02-2 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relative inscriptions===
[[File:Periander Pio-Clementino Inv276.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Bust of [[Periander]] bearing the inscription "Periander, son of [[Cypselus]], [[Corinth]]ian". Marble, Roman copy after a Greek original by [[Kresilas]], 4th century]]
Inscriptions having a direct relation to the object, or representation, on which they are inscribed, vary greatly in their contents. Those relating to [[picture]] or [[relief]] chronicles of the victories or exploits of kings, as in Egypt and Mesopotamia, serve as a record of the events, and help to interpret the scenes. Such inscriptions are not common in Greek or Roman work; but frequently, especially in early Greek times, and on vases, the names of persons and even of objects are written beside them for the purpose of identification, and sometimes a speech issues from the mouth of the figure. On the carved wooden chest of [[Cypselus]], of about 600 BC [[hexameter]] verses were written, curving about among figures, and giving a description of each scene. The bases of statues and reliefs often had inscriptions cut upon them for identification and record. This was particularly the case with honorary statues and tombstones. In other cases, where there is an evident relation between the artistic representation and the inscription, the figures are subordinate and seem merely to illustrate the text, as when a treaty between Athens and [[Samos]] has a relief at its head representing the [[goddess]] [[Athena]] and [[Hera]] clasping hands, as representatives of their respective cities. In other cases, the arms or device of a city is carved on an inscription, almost like a seal on a document. In all these cases the figures and the inscription are part of a common design, whether carried out by the same hand or not. But in the case of owners' marks or names cut on vases or other objects, or of the dedication of such objects, the inscription is not necessarily contemporary; it may indeed be misleading, as in the case, mentioned with disapproval by [[Cicero]], of using again old Greek statues and placing new dedicatory inscriptions on them in Roman times, a sort of "recycling": for instance, one of the statues of Athenian knights of the 5th century BC placed at the entrance of the Acropolis, had a later inscription cut on its base to make it serve as an equestrian statue of [[Germanicus]], probably in 18 AD when he visited Athens. In Egypt and Mesopotamia also it is not unusual to find the name of a later king of official cut upon an earlier work.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the [[Cicero]] reference cf. {{cite book |author=Margherita Guarducci   |authorlink=Margherita Guarducci |year=1995 |title=Epigrafia greca |location=Rome |publisher=Ist. Poligrafico dello Stato |pages= 87ff |isbn= |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent inscriptions===
The majority of inscriptions are of independent value and interest, the object on which they are cut being either provided for the purpose or utilised as convenient and suitable. Such inscriptions may be classified as ''(a) Religious'' and ''(b) Political and Social''. The distinction between the two is not always easy to draw; for in almost all ancient civilisations religion was a part of the established service of the State, and was under public control, or at least was closely bound up with political administration. It follows that many inscriptions relating to religious matters take the form of political decrees or state documents, and therefore might, especially as far as form is concerned, be included in either category; but it is usually possible to classify them according to their contents and intention.

====Temples, their foundation and administration====
A [[temple]] was often a kind of religious corporation under the control of the State; and its accounts and details of administration were made public at frequent intervals, usually annually, by means of inscriptions, exhibited to public view in its precinct. Many such inscriptions have been found, and supply a great deal of information that can be obtained from no other source. Some great temples, such as that of [[Apollo]] on the island of [[Delos]], held great amounts of property, both real and portable, the latter taking the form either of more or less precious offerings dedicated in the temple and its surrounding buildings, or of coined money. The inscriptions accordingly record gifts and acquisitions of landed property, leases and assignments, payments of rent and fines for default, loans and interest and many other business transactions suitable to a great landed proprietor or to a bank. They therefore throw much light upon the social and economic conditions of ancient life, such as are nowhere else recorded. Again, the lists of offerings dedicated in the temple and other buildings enable us to realise almost visually the appearance of their contents. These are described as being on the floor, on the walls, on shelves or in cases; they consisted of vases and other objects suitable for use in the temple service; ornaments and jewels; statuettes, mostly in gold and silver; weapons and tools; coined money; and [[bullion]], mostly melted down from old offerings. The detailed care that was taken in this last case, to ensure that the full weight of these objects was preserved, whether made into a new vessel or not, is recorded in other inscriptions. These elaborate inventories were checked and revised by each successive board of administrators, and gave the best possible security against any robbery or [[peculation]]. In addition to such general lists, there are also innumerable records of various gifts and acquisitions, whether of land and houses, or of movable property of all sorts. Buildings and repairs are also recorded, sometimes by the State, sometimes by individuals, whose piety and generosity are suitably honoured. In form, these are often hardly to be distinguished from public works of a secular character, which must be mentioned later.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2006"/&gt;

The inscriptions on or belonging to special dedications are often of great historical interest — there need only be quoted the inscription on the famous [[Serpent Column]], once at [[Delphi]] and now in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]], with the list of the Greek States which took part in the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian War]]; and that relating to the Roman arms dedicated by [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] at [[Dodona]] after his victories. Most of the great temples being of immemorial sanctity, it is hardly to be expected that any records of their foundation should be found in inscriptions. But on the other hand we have many accounts of the dedication of new temples, either by states or communities or by private individuals. In almost all such cases it was necessary to obtain sanction for the foundation from the State; thus the inscription often takes the form of a decree of the people authorising the foundation of the temple and often giving some privileges to the founder or founders.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Priests and other officials====
[[File:KaranisSouthTempleGreekInscr.jpg|thumb|Greek inscription at the south temple, [[Karanis|Kom Aushim (Karanis)]], [[Faiyum]], [[Egypt]]]]
Inscriptions give much information as to priests and other religious officials. There are in the first place lists of priests, some of them covering long periods and even going back to mythical times; there are also lists of treasures and administrators, who were usually lay officials appointed for the purpose, either by election or by lot. The duties and privileges of priests are recorded in many inscriptions, and vary considerably from place to place. It is recorded, for instance, what portions of a victim at any sacrifice were to be received by the priest. In any important temple this must evidently have been far more than the priest or his family could consume, and accordingly it must have been sold, and so constituted a considerable source of income. Consequently, a [[priesthood]] was an office well paid and much sought after; and we actually find in later Greek times, especially in Asia Minor, that priesthoods were frequently sold, under proper guarantees and with due sureties as to the duties being carried out. Sometimes a fee to the priest had to be paid in cash; in some cases a priest or priestess was allowed to take up a collection on certain days. On the other hand, the duties of a priest are often recorded; he had to see to the cleaning and care of the temple and its contents, to provide flowers and garlands for decorations and to supply the regular daily service. Sacrifices on great occasions were usually provided by the State, as also were important repairs; but in some cases a priest undertook these on his own account, and was honoured accordingly — for instance, by being allowed to inscribe his name in the restored temple.

Besides priests, we find many other officials of various ranks attached to temples and recorded in inscriptions. Some of these, especially those who were concerned with buildings or constructions, or with the inventories of temple treasures and the accounts of administration, were lay officials appointed by the State, as in the case of political officers. But many others had specialised sacerdotal functions; for instance, in many places there were ''[[manteis]]'' or prophets, often of special families with hereditary skills in [[divination]]; at [[Eleusis]] we find records of the [[hierophant]], the torch-bearer, and others who took part in the celebration of the mysteries. At Olympia, in later Greek times, we find a remarkable list of officials, that is: three priests, three libation pourers, two prophets, three custodians (of keys), a flute-player, an interpreter, a priest for the daily sacrifice, a secretary, a wine-pourer, three dancers at libations, a woodman (to supply wood for the sacrifices), and a steward and cook — the last no sinecure, in view of the numerous sacrificial feasts.

There were also many more menial offices in the service of temples which were carried out by slaves. Such slaves were often presented to the temple or acquired in some other way. There is a whole class of inscriptions, found on many sites, in which the sale of slaves to a temple or to the god of a temple is recorded. It is often difficult to know whether such slaves were intended for the service of a temple, or, on the other hand, such service was either purely formal or was not required at all, the sale to the temple being intended as fictitious, so as to enable a slave to acquire his own freedom and at the same time to secure the protection of the god in his free status.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Ritual====
[[File:Votive relief Asklepios BM809.jpg|thumb|Votive relief for the cure of a bad leg, inscription from the shrine of [[Asclepius]] at [[Milos]], [[Ægean Sea]].]]

The ritual appropriate to different divinities and temples varied greatly from place to place; and it was, therefore, necessary or desirable to set up notices in all public places of worship for the information and guidance of worshippers. The commonest and most essential act of worship was sacrifice; an example of the simplest form of prescription is to be seen in the inscription on the relief from [[Thasos]] in the [[Louvre]]:— "To the [[Nymphs]] and to Apollo the leader of the Nymphs, the worshipper may, if he so choose, sacrifice a male and a female victim. It is not permissible to offer a sheep or a pig. No [[paean]] is sung. To the [[Graces]] it is not permissible to offer a goat or a pig."&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Louvre%20Ma%20696&amp;object=Sculpture Louvre Ma 696 (Sculpture)], ''Relief Plaques from Thasos''; see also classification on [http://poinikastas.csad.ox.ac.uk/4DLink3/4DACTION/LSAGwebDisplayInscription?searchTerm=Relief&amp;searchType=browse&amp;searchField=object&amp;returnList=0&amp;sequence=0&amp;thisListPosition=8 Poinikastas:"Thasos, inscriptions"] - IG vol. xii.8 no. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is to be noticed that this order of service contains a prohibition as well as a prescription. Such prohibitions are frequent, and often relate to the need of ceremonial purity in all worshippers entering a sacred precinct. They must for a certain time have abstained from certain prescribed means of pollution, varying from place to place. The officials are sometimes ordered to erect notices giving information on this point; for instance, at the precinct of [[Alectrona]] at [[Ialysus]], it was prescribed that "no horse, ass, mule, nor any other animal with a bushy tail should enter, and that nobody should bring such animals in or wear shoes or any article produced from pigs. There is also a fine for driving in sheep."&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt; Other precincts were protected in a more general manner from any invasion or violation. It was prohibited to cut wood or to remove earth and stones, or to drive any beasts into some precincts; the right of erecting booths was either restricted or denied altogether. Sometimes more detailed prescriptions are given for the whole organisation of a festival; thus, at [[Andania]], in [[Messenia]], the arrangements for the celebration of the local [[Eleusinia]], the dress of the participants, the officials and policing, are very fully described. Similarly, in the Hall of the Iobacchi, at Athens, the order of proceedings, the officers and the characters in the sacred play, and various administrative details are ordered.&lt;ref name="GEpi"&gt;Cf. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ECc9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA240&amp;lpg=PA240&amp;dq=hall+of+the+Iobacchi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bUASHSU5ET&amp;sig=7bVtQ6GblyM1sojunQokSFuWsp0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bddVUd6wKafI0QWx2YGABA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hall%20of%20the%20Iobacchi&amp;f=false ''An Introduction to Greek Epigraphy''], Cambridge University Press - (undated, no author cited)Googlebook; see also [https://books.google.com/books?id=tTUFC3S-7r4C&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=hall+of+the+Iobacchi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LWja_v4xvP&amp;sig=d2eJ6F9VifPiDz35NlU7PXqzFbg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bddVUd6wKafI0QWx2YGABA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hall%20of%20the%20Iobacchi&amp;f=false ''Ancient Athens''], Haskell House Publ., 1902 (no author cited) Googlebook&lt;/ref&gt;

When there is any doubt about any ritual or procedure, divination is often resorted to, and the results of such divination are recorded in inscriptions as a guidance for the future; it was also a common practice to consult Delphi or some other [[oracle]] in doubtful or difficult cases; there the exact method of procedure is sometimes recorded, as well as the response of the oracle. Forms of worship are often prescribed or recorded, especially hymns, which are sometimes inscribed together with their musical notation. The performance of songs or hymns and dances are also matters of constant reference, especially in connection with lyrical or musical contests; the victorious band or performer often dedicated the prize in honour of the god. A special form of contest was that in dramatic performances, of which many records have survived, both from Athens and from many other parts of the Greek world. The regulation of athletic festivals, and the records of victors in their contests, also form a numerous class of inscriptions. As regards mysteries, though there are numerous regulations affecting the arrangement of celebrations and the conduct of those participating, there is, as was to be expected, very little concerning the actual performances.

Another interesting phase of Greek religion known to us mainly from inscriptions is offered by the shrines of healing. The most notable of these is the precinct of [[Asclepius]] at [[Epidaurus]]. Here have been found, on large slabs of inscription, compiled, in all probability, from earlier documents, lists of the cures effected by Apollo and Asclepius. The cures are of the most varied kinds, from painful diseases or surgical cases to a lost boy and a broken cup. The formula is in almost all cases the same: the consultant come to Epidaurus, sleeps in the ''[[Epidaurus|abaton]]'', has dreams or sees visions, and comes out whole. In later times, when such faith-healing had probably become less efficacious, elaborate prescriptions of diet and hygiene are recorded.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2006"/&gt;

A special form of prayer consists of curses, which were often buried in the ground, probably with the intent to reach the infernal gods. Such curses often give the reason for their being made, usually some injury done to the author of the curse; sometimes they devote the offender to the infernal gods.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Private associations for religious purposes====
Another elements in Greek religion which is known to us almost exclusively by means of inscriptions, is to be found in the religious associations that existed in many Greek cities, apart from the organisation of state religion, though sometimes recognised by it. These associations had each its own regulations, which were duly recorded in inscriptions; they varied greatly both in purpose and in character. Many of them had a definitely religious purpose, in the worship of certain gods; sometimes an alien community was given special permission to worship its own god or gods in its own way. Other associations were more social in character and served as clubs, or as burial societies. A remarkable feature about such associations is that the lists of members of many of them include the names of women and of slaves, thus contrasting with the civic basis of established religion in Greece, and anticipating a religion in which "there can be neither [[Jew]] nor [[Greek people|Greek]], there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female."&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#3:28|Galatians 3:28]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and social===

====Codes of law and regulations====
Ancient writers state that the earliest laws of Athens were inscribed upon tablets of wood, put together in a pyramidal shape. These, owing to their material, have perished; but we have some very early [[codes of law]] preserved on stone, notably at [[Gortyna]] in Crete. Here an inscription of great length is incised on the slabs of a theatre-shaped structure in 12 columns of 50 lines each; it is mainly concerned with the law of inheritance, adoption, etc. Doubtless similar inscriptions were set up in many places in Greece. An interesting series of inscriptions deals with the conditions under which colonists were sent out from various cities, and the measures that were taken to secure their rights as citizens. A bronze tablet records in some detail the arrangements of this sort made when [[Locrians]] established a colony in [[Naupactus]]; another inscription relates to the Athenian colonisation of [[Salamis Island|Salamis]], in the 6th century BC.

====Decrees of people and rulers, later of kings and emperors====
A very large number of inscriptions are in the form of decrees of various cities and peoples, even when their subject matter suggests that they should be classified under other headings. Almost all legislative and many administrative measures take this form; often a decree prescribes how and where the inscription should be set up. The formulae and preambles of such decrees vary considerably from place to place, and from period to period. Those of Athens are by far the most exactly known, owing to the immense number that have been discovered; and they are so strictly stereotyped that can be classified with the precision of algebraic formulae, and often dated to within a few years by this test alone. Very full lists for this purpose have been drawn up by epigraphist Wilhelm Larfeld, in his work on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. his classic work (downloadable) [https://archive.org/details/griechischeepigr00larf ''Griechische Epigraphik'' (1914)] at [[University of Toronto]] - Robarts Library, eBook.&lt;/ref&gt; It is usual to record the year (by the name of the eponymous archon), the day of the month and of the [[prytany]] (or presiding commission according to tribes), various secretaries, the presiding officials and the proposer of the decree. It is also stated whether the resolution is passed by the senate ([[Boule (ancient Greece)|Boule]]) or the assembly of the people ([[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]]), or both. The circumstances or the reason of the resolution are then given, and finally the decision itself. Some other cities followed Athens in the form of their decrees, with such local variations as were required; others were more independent in their development, and different magistracies or forms of government had various results. In the [[Hellenistic Age]], and later, the forms of independent government were, to a great extent, kept up, though little real power remained with the people. On the other hand, it is common thing to find letters from kings, and later from [[Roman emperors]], inscribed and set up in public places.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Public accounts, treasure lists, building inscriptions====
It was customary to inscribe on stone all records of the receipt, custody and expenditure of public money or treasure, so that citizens could verify for themselves the safety and due control of the State in all financial matters. As in the case of temple accounts, it was usual for each temporary board of officials to render to their successors an account of their stewardship, and of the resources and treasures which they handed over. In all cases of public works, the expenditure was ordered by the State, and detailed reports were drawn up and inscribed on stone at intervals while the work was being carried out. In many cases there is a detailed specification of building work which makes it possible, not only to realise all the technical details and processes employed, but also the whole plan and structure of a building. A notable instance is the [[arsenal]] of [[Philon]] at the [[Peiraeus]] which has been completely reconstructed on paper by architects from the building specification.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Phil"&gt;Built under the administration of [[Lycurgus of Athens|Lycurgus]], {{cite book|author=Smith, Sir William, ed.|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology|chapter=Philon, A very eminent architect at Athens|year=1859|volume=vol. III|location=Boston|publisher=Little, Brown, and Company|page= 314|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcwPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA314}}. E. A. Gardner, ''op.cit.'' p. 557, observes that it "is perhaps known to us more in detail than any other lost monument of antiquity." It was to hold the rigging of the [[galley]]s; and was so contrived that all its contents were visible from a central hall, and so liable to the inspection of the Athenian [[democracy]]. Philon's arsenal was destroyed by the forces of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] in the [[First Mithridatic War#Sulla's siege of Athens, summer 87-early 86 BC|Roman conquest of Athens in 86 BC]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the [[Erechtheum]], we have not only a detailed report on the unfinished state of the building in 409 BC, but also accounts of the expenditure and payments to the workmen employed in finishing it. Similar accounts have been preserved of the building of the [[Parthenon]], spread over 15 years; in the case of both the Parthenon and the Erechtheum, there are included the payments made to those who made the sculptures.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Jenkins   |title=Greek Architecture And Its Sculpture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dLego4eAgZUC|accessdate=29 March 2013|year=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02388-8|pages=118–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jeffrey M.

Naval and military expenditure is also fully accounted for; among other information there are records of the [[galley]]-slips at the different harbours of the Piraeus, and of the ships of the Athenian navy, with their names and condition. In short, there is no department of state economy and financial administration that is not abundantly illustrated by the record of inscriptions.&lt;ref name="Phil"/&gt; A set of records of high historical value are the ''"tribute lists"'', recording the quota paid to Athens by her [[Members of the Delian League|subject allies]] during the 5th century BC. These throw much light on her relations with them at various periods.(Cf. [[Delian League]]).

[[File:Stele with an ephebic list NAMA 1484 (DerHexer).JPG|thumb|[[Stele]] with an [[ephebos|ephebic]] list, Athens, 4th century BC]]

====Ephebic inscriptions====
An institution as to which our knowledge is mainly derived from inscriptions is the [[ephebos|ephebic system]] at Athens. There are not only records of lists of [[ephebos|ephebi]] and of their guardians and instructors, but also decrees in honour of their services, especially in taking their due part in religious and other ceremonies, and resolutions of the ephebi themselves in honour of their officials. It is possible to trace in the inscriptions, which range over several centuries, how what was originally a system of physical and military training for Athenian youths from age of 18 to 20, with outpost and police duties, was gradually transformed. In later times there were added to the instructors in military exercises others who gave lectures on what we should now call arts and science subjects; so that in the Hellenistic and Roman times, when youths from all parts of the civilised world flocked to Athens as an intellectual centre, the ephebic system became a kind of cosmopolitan university.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author=O. W. Reinmuth   |title=The Ephebic Inscriptions of the Fourth Century B.C. |url= |accessdate= |year=1971 |publisher=Leiden Brill |isbn= |pages= ''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treaties and political and commercial agreements; arbitration, etc.====
In addition to inscriptions which are concerned with the internal affairs of various cities, there are many others recording treaties or other agreements of an international character between various cities and states. These were incised on bronze or stone, and set up in places of public resort in the cities concerned, or in common religious centres such as Olympia and Delphi. The simplest form of treaty is merely an alliance for a certain term of years, usually with some penalty for any breach of the conditions. Often an oath was prescribed, to be taken by representatives on each side; it was also not unusual to appeal to the god in whose temple the treaty was exhibited. In other cases a list of gods by whom the two parties must swear is prescribed. Commercial clauses were sometimes added to treaties of alliance, and commercial treaties are also found, agreeing as to the export and import of merchandise and other things. In later days, especially in the time of the Hellenistic kings, treaties tend to become more complicated and detailed in their provisions.&lt;ref name="GEpi"/&gt;

Another series of records of great historical interest is concerned with arbitration between various states on various questions, mainly concerned with frontiers. In cases of dispute it was not uncommon for the two disputants to appoint a third party as arbitrator. Sometimes this third party was another State, sometimes a specified number of individuals. Thus, in a frontier dispute between Corinth and [[Epidaurus]], 151 citizens of [[Megara]] were appointed by name to arbitrate, and when the decision was disputed, 31 from among them revised and confirmed it. In all such cases it was the custom for a full record to be preserved on stone and set up in the places concerned. In this case the initiative in referring the matter to arbitration came from the [[Achaean League]].&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Proxenia decrees====
A very large class of inscriptions deals with the institution of ''[[proxenia]]''. According to this a citizen of any State might be appointed ''proxenos'' of another State; his duties would then be to offer help and hospitality to any citizen of that other State who might be visiting his city, and to assist him in any dispute or in securing his legal rights. The office has been compared to the modern appointment of [[consul (representative)|consul]]s, with the essential difference that the ''proxenos'' is always a citizen of the state in which he resides, not of that whose citizens and interests he assists. The decrees upon this matter frequently record the appointment of a ''proxenos'', and the conferring on him of certain benefits and privileges in return for his services; they also contain resolutions of thanks from the city served by the ''proxenos'', and record honours consequently conferred upon him.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author=Enrica Culasso Gastaldi   |title=Le prossenie ateniesi del IV secolo a.C.: gli onorati asiatici (Fonti e studi di storia antica, 10) |url= |accessdate= |year=2004 |location=Alessandria |publisher=Edizioni dell'Orso |isbn= |pages= ''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Honours and privileges given to individuals====
This class of inscription is in form not unlike the last, except that honours recorded are given for all sorts of services, private and public, to the State and to individuals. A frequent addition is an invitation to dine in the [[Prytaneum]] at Athens. Some are inscribed on the bases of statues set up to the recipient. In early times these inscriptions are usually brief and simple. The bust of [[Pericles]] on the Acropolis held nothing but the names of Pericles himself and of the sculptor [[Kresilas]]. Later it became usual to give, in some detail, the reasons for the honours awarded; and in Hellenistic and Roman times, these became more and more detailed and fulsome in laudatory detail.

====Signatures of artists====
[[File:Sophilos me grafsen inscription Lebes BM 1971.11-1.1.jpg|thumb|Black-figure [[dinos]] with stand, Attic, c. 570 BC. Signed by [[Sophilos]]: ΣΟΦΙΛΟΣ [...] ΜΕΓΡΑΦΣΕΝ, "Sophilos drew me"]]

These inscriptions are of special interest as throwing much light upon the history of art. The artist's name was usually, especially in earlier times, carved upon the base of the pedestal of a statue, and consequently was easily separated from it if the statue was carried off or destroyed. A case where both statue and pedestal are preserved is offered by the ''[[Victory]]'', signed on its pedestal by [[Paeonius]] at Olympia. Occasionally, and more frequently in later times, the artist's signature was carved upon some portion of the statue itself. But in later copies of well-known works, it has to be considered whether the name is that of the original artist or of the copyist who reproduced his work. (see for example, [[#FN1|the statue of Hercules/Heracles]] below)

A special class of artists' signatures is offered by the names signed by [[Attic vase|Attic]] and other vase painters upon their vases. These have been made the basis of a minute [[Pottery of ancient Greece|historical and stylistic study]] of the work of these painters, and unsigned vases also have been grouped with the signed ones, so as to make an exact and detailed record of this branch of Greek artistic production.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''int. al.'', {{cite book|author=Joseph Veach Noble   |title=The Techniques of Painted Attic Pottery |url= |accessdate= |year=1988 |location=New York |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |isbn=978-0500050477 |pages=}}; {{cite book|author=Martin Robinson   |title=The Art of Vase-Painting in Classical Athens |url= |accessdate= |year=1992 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521338813 |pages=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical records====
The great majority of these fall into one of the classes already referred to. But there are some instances in which an inscription is set up merely as a record. For instance, a victor in athletic or other contests may set up a list of his victories. The most famous historical record is the [[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|autobiographical account of the deeds and administration]] of [[Augustus]], which was reproduced and set up in many places; it is generally known as the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]], because the most complete copy of it was found at [[Ancyra]]. The [[Marmor Parium]] at [[Oxford]], found in [[Paros]], is a chronological record of Greek history, probably made for educational purposes, and valuable as giving the traditional dates of events from the earliest time down.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author1=P. Botteri |author2=G. Fangi |title=The Ancyra Project: the Temple of Augustus and Rome |url= |accessdate= |year=2003 |location=Ankara |publisher=ISPRS Archives, volume XXXIV part 5/W12 Commission V |isbn= |pages=84–88}}; see also ''[https://archive.org/details/parianchronicle00robegoog The Parian chronicle, or The chronicle of the Arundelian marbles; with a dissertation concerning its authenticity]'' by [[Joseph Robertson (clergyman)|Joseph Robertson]] 1788, from the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tombs and epitaphs====
This is by far the most numerous class of inscriptions, both Greek and Latin. In early times there is often no record beyond the name of the deceased in Athens, often with the name of his father and his [[deme]]. Sometimes a word or two of conventional praise is added, such as "a good and wise man". Occasionally the circumstances of death are alluded to, especially if it took place in battle or at sea. Such [[epitaph]]s were frequently in [[metrical form]], usually either [[hexameter]] or [[elegiacs]]. Many of them have been collected, and they form an interesting addition to the Greek anthology. In later times it becomes usual to give more elaborate praise of the deceased; but this is hardly ever so detailed and fulsome as on more modern tombstones. The age and other facts about the deceased are occasionally given, but not nearly so often as on Latin tombstones, which offer valuable statistical information in this respect.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''int. al.'' the interesting ''[[Epitaph of Seikilos]]'' by C. V. Palisca &amp; J. P. Burkholder, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin inscriptions==
{{See also|Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|List of classical abbreviations}}
[[File:Aquileia Basilica - Ausgrabungen Mosaik 5.jpg|thumb|[[Basilica of Aquileia]], 4th-century mosaic with Latin inscription: ''IANUARI DEDEI DONO P * DCCCLXX'' (Januarius paid for 870 square feet of mosaic)]]

[[Latin language|Latin]] inscriptions may be classified on much the same lines as Greek; but certain broad distinctions may be drawn at the outset. They are generally more standardised as to form and as to content, not only in Rome and Italy, but also throughout the [[provinces of the Roman Empire]]. One of the chief difficulties in deciphering [[Latin Inscriptions]] lies in the very extensive use of [[List of classical abbreviations|initials and abbreviations]]. These are of great number and variety, and while some of them can be easily interpreted as belonging to well-known formulae, others offer considerable difficulty, especially to the inexperienced student.&lt;ref&gt;A mere list of such initials and abbreviations occupies 68 pages in [[René Cagnat]]'s ''Cours d'épigraphie Latine'' (repr. 1923). A selection is included in [[Wikipedia]]'s "[[List of classical abbreviations]]".&lt;/ref&gt; Often the same initial may have many different meanings according to the context. Some common formulae such as '''V.S.L.M.''' (''votum solvit libens merito''), or '''H.M.H.N.S.''' (''hoc monumentum heredem non sequetur'') offer little difficulty, but there are many which are not so obvious and leave room for conjecture. Often the only way to determine the meaning is to search through a list of initials, such as those given by modern Latin epigraphists, until a formula is found which fits the context.

Most of what has been said about Greek inscriptions applies to Roman also. The commonest materials in this case also are stone, marble and bronze; but a more extensive use is made of stamped bricks and tiles, which are often of historical value as identifying and dating a building or other construction. The same applies to leaden water pipes which frequently bear dates and names of officials. Terracotta lamps also frequently have their makers' names and other information stamped upon them. Arms, and especially shields, sometimes bear the name and corps of their owners. Leaden discs were also used to serve the same purpose as modern identification discs. Inscriptions are also found on sling bullets — Roman as well as Greek; there are also numerous classes of ''[[tesserae]]'' or tickets of admission to theatres or other shows.

As regards the contents of inscriptions, there must evidently be a considerable difference between records of a number of independent city states and an empire including almost all the civilised world; but municipalities maintained much of their independent traditions in Roman times, and consequently their inscriptions often follow the old formulas.

The classification of Roman inscriptions may, therefore, follow the same lines as the Greek, except that certain categories are absent, and that some others, not found in Greek, are of considerable importance.

===Religious===

====Dedications and foundations of temples, etc.====
[[File:RMW - Weiheplakette Victoria.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Votive plaque for ''Victoria'', set by Flavius Primus, curator of the [[Turma]] [[Maximinus Thrax|Maximini]]&lt;ref&gt;It reads: ''Victo(riae) Fl(avius) P/rimus cur(ator) / tur(mae) Maxi/mini''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

These are very numerous; and the custom of placing the name of the dedicator in a conspicuous place on the building was prevalent, especially in the case of dedications by emperors or officials, or by public bodies. Restoration or repair was often recorded in the same manner. In the case of small objects the dedication is usually simple in form; it usually contains the name of the god or other recipient and of the donor, and a common formula is '''D.D.''' (''dedit, donavit'') often with additions such as '''L.M.''' (''libens merito''). Such dedications are often the result of a vow, and '''V.S.''' (''votum solvit'') is therefore often added. Bequests made under the wills of rich citizens are frequently recorded by inscriptions; these might either be for religious or for social purposes.

====Priests and officials====
A priesthood was frequently a political office and consequently is mentioned along with political honours in the list of a man's distinctions. The priesthoods that a man had held are usually mentioned first in inscriptions before his civil offices and distinctions. Religious offices, as well as civil, were restricted to certain classes, the highest to those of senatorial rank, the next to those of [[Equestrian order|equestrian status]]; many minor offices, both in Rome and in the provinces, are enumerated in their due order.

====Regulations as to religion and cult====
Among the most interesting of these is the ancient song and accompanying dance performed by the priests known as the [[Arval Brothers]]. This is, however, not in the form of a ritual prescription, but a detailed record of the due performance of the rite. An important class of documents is the series of calendars that have been found in Rome and in the various Italian towns. These give notice of religious festivals and anniversaries, and also of the days available for various purposes.

====Colleges====
The various collegese for religious purposes were very numerous. Many of them, both in Rome and Italy, and in provincial municipalities, were of the nature of priesthoods. Some were regarded as offices of high distinction and were open only to men of senatorial rank; among these were the [[Augurs]], the [[Fetiales]], the [[Salii]]; also the [[Sodales Augustales|Sodales Divorum Augustorum]] in imperial times. The records of these colleges sometimes give no information beyond the names of members, but these are often of considerable interest. [[Haruspices]] and [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#Luperci|Luperci]] were of equestrian rank.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Political and social===

====Codes of law and regulations====
Our information as to these is not mainly drawn from inscriptions and, therefore, they need not here be considered. On the other hand, the word ''lex'' (law) is usually applied to all decrees of the senate or other bodies, whether of legislative or of administrative character. It is therefore, best to consider all together under the heading of public decrees.

====Laws and plebiscites, senatus consulta, decrees of magistrates or later of emperors====
A certain number of these dating from republican times are of considerable interest. One of the earliest relates to the prohibition of [[Bacchanalia|bacchanalian orgies]] in Italy; it takes the form of a message from the magistrates, stating the authority on which they acted. Laws all follow a fixed formula, according to the body which has passed them. First there is a statement that the legislative body was consulted by the appropriate magistrate in due form; then follows the text of the law; and finally the sanction, the statement that the law was passed. In decrees of the senate the formula differs somewhat. They begin with a preamble giving the names of the consulting magistrates, the place and conditions of the meeting; then comes the subject submitted for decision, ending with the formula '''QDERFP''' (''quid de ea re fieri placeret''); then comes the decision of the senate, opening with '''DERIC''' (''de ea re ita censuerunt''). '''C.''' is added at the end, to indicate that the decree was passed. In imperial times, the emperor sometimes addressed a speech to the senate, advising them to pass certain resolutions, or else, especially in later times, gave orders or instructions directly, either on his own initiative or in response to questions or references. The number and variety of such orders is such that no classification of them can be given here. One of the most famous is the edict of [[Diocletian]], [[Edict on Maximum Prices|fixing the prices of all commodities]]. Copies of this in Greek as well as in Latin have been found in various parts of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author=E.R. Graser   |title=An Economic Survey of Ancient Rome Volume V: Rome and Italy of the Empire |editor=T. Frank |url= |accessdate= |year=1940 |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins Press — esp. "A text and translation of the Edict of Diocletian" |isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Records of buildings, etc.====
[[File:Hans lutz Pfk bozen.jpg|thumb|German inscription recording the building of [[Bozen]]-Bolzano's Parish Church ([[South Tyrol]]) by Hans Lutz of Schussenried, from the early 16th century (1501–1519)]]
A very large number of inscriptions record the construction or repair of public buildings by private individuals, by magistrates, Roman or provincial, and by emperors. In addition to the dedication of temples, we find inscriptions recording the construction of [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]]s, roads, especially on [[milestone]]s, baths, [[basilica]]s, [[portico]]s and many other works of public utility. In inscriptions of early period often nothing is given but the name of the person who built or restored the edifice and a statement that he had done so. But later it was usual to give more detail as to the motive of the building, the name of the emperor or a magistrate giving the date, the authority for the building and the names and distinctions of the builders; then follows a description of the building, the source of the expenditure (e.g., '''S.P.''', ''sua pecunia'') and finally the appropriate verb for the work done, whether building, restoring, enlarging or otherwise improving. Other details are sometimes added, such as the name of the man under whose direction the work was done.

====Military documents====
[[File:AMG - Ziegel Cohors III.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Brick stamp with military record: "C(ohors) III BR(acaraugustanorum)", from [[Bavaria]].]]

These vary greatly in content, and are among the most important documents concerning the administration of the Roman Empire. "They are numerous and of all sorts — tombstones of every degree, lists of soldiers' burial clubs, certificates of discharge from service, schedules of time-expired men, dedications of altars, records of building or of engineering works accomplished. The facts directly commemorated are rarely important."&lt;ref name="Haverf"&gt;{{aut|Francis Haverfield}}, "Roman Authority" in {{aut|S. R. Driver, D. G. Hogarth, F. L. Griffith}}, ''et al.'' ''Authority and Archaeology, Sacred and Profane: Essays On the Relation of Monuments to Biblical and Classical Literature'', Ulan Press (repr. 2012), p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; But when the information from hundreds of such inscriptions is collected together, "you can trace the whole policy of the Imperial Government in the matter of recruiting, to what extent and till what date legionaries were raised in Italy; what contingents for various branches of the service were drawn from the provinces, and which provinces provided most; how far provincials garrisoned their own countries, and which of them, like the British recruits, were sent as a measure of precaution to serve elsewhere; or, finally, at what epoch the empire grew weak enough to require the enlistment of barbarians from beyond its frontiers."&lt;ref name="Haverf"/&gt;

====Treaties and agreements====
There were many treaties between Rome and other states in [[Roman Republic|republican times]]; but we do not, as a rule, owe our knowledge of these to inscriptions, which are very rare in this earlier period. In imperial times, to which most Latin inscriptions belong, international relations were subject to the universal domination of Rome, and consequently the documents relating to them are concerned with reference to the central authority, and often take the form of orders from the emperor.
&lt;span id="FN1"&gt;

====Proxeny====
{{See also|Patronage in ancient Rome}}
This custom belonged to Greece. What most nearly corresponded to it in Roman times was the adoption of some distinguished Roman as its ''[[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron]]'', by a city or state. The relation was then recorded, usually on a bronze tablet placed in some conspicuous position in the town concerned. The patron probably also kept a copy in his house, or had a portable tablet which would ensure his recognition and reception.

====Honorary====
Honorary inscriptions are extremely common in all parts of the Roman world. Sometimes they are placed on the bases of statues, sometimes in documents set up to record some particular benefaction or the construction of some public work. The offices held by the person commemorated, and the distinctions conferred upon him are enumerated in a regularly established order (''[[cursus honorum]]''), either beginning with the lower and proceeding step by step to the higher, or in reverse order with the highest first. Religious and priestly offices are usually mentioned before civil and political ones. These might be exercised either in Rome itself, or in the various municipalities of the empire. There was also a distinction drawn between offices that might be held only by persons of senatorial rank, those that were assigned to persons of equestrian rank, and those of a less distinguished kind. It follows that when only a portion of an inscription has been found, it is often possible to restore the whole in accordance with the accepted order.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Signatures of artists====
When these are attached to statues, it is sometimes doubtful whether the name is that of the man who actually made the statue, or of the master whose work it reproduces. Thus there are two well-known copies of a statue of [[Hercules]] by [[Lysippus]], of which one is said to be the work of Lysippus, and the other states that it was [[#FN1|made by Glycon (see images)]]. Another kind of artist's or artificer's signature that is commoner in Roman times is to be found in the signatures of potters upon lamps and various kinds of vessels; they are usually impressed on the mould and stand out in relief on the terracotta or other material. These are of interest as giving much information as to the commercial spread of various kinds of handicrafts, and also as to the conditions under which they were manufactured.

[[File:MCR - colonna rostrata di C Duilio 1150130.JPG|thumb|Reproduction of the ''[[Rostral column|Columna Rostrata]]'' of [[Gaius Duilius]] (c. 260 BC) at the [[Museum of Roman Civilization]].]]

====Historical records====
Many of these inscriptions might well be assigned to one of the categories already considered. But there are some which were expressly made to commemorate an important event, or to preserve a record. Among the most interesting is the inscription of the ''[[Rostral column|Columna Rostrata]]'' in Rome, which records the great naval victory of [[Gaius Duilius]] over the [[Carthaginians]]; this, however, is not the original, but a later and somewhat modified version. A document of high importance is a summary of the life and achievements of Augustus, already mentioned, and known as the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]]. The various sets of [[Fasti]] constituted a record of the names of consuls, and other magistrates or high officials, and also of the triumphs accorded to conquering generals.

====Inscriptions on tombs====
[[Image:Scipio-tomb.jpg|thumb|left|The [[tomb]] of [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus]], erected around 150 BC, contains an [[Old Latin]] inscription in [[Saturnian Metre]].]]
These are probably the most numerous of all classes of inscriptions; and though many of them are of no great individual interest, they convey, when taken collectively, much valuable information as to the distribution and transference of population, as to trades and professions, as to health and longevity, and as to many other conditions of ancient life. The most interesting early series is that on the tombs of the [[Scipio (cognomen)|Scipios]] at Rome, recording, mostly in [[Saturnian Metre]], the exploits and distinctions of the various members of that family.&lt;ref name="Cour"&gt;Cf. {{cite book|author=Edward Courtney   |title=MUSA LAPIDARIA: A Selection of Latin Verse Inscriptions |url= |accessdate= |year=1995 |location=Atlanta |publisher=Scholars Press |isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About the end of the republic and the beginning of the empire, it became customary to head a tombstone with the letters '''D.M.''' or '''D.M.S.''' (''Dis Manibus sacrum''), thus consecrating the tomb to the deceased as having become members of the [[Manes|body of ghosts or spirits of the dead]]. These are followed by the name of the deceased, usually with his father's name and his tribe, by his honours and distinctions, sometimes by a record of his age. The inscription often concludes with '''H.I.''' (''Hic iacet''), or some similar formula, and also, frequently, with a statement of boundaries and a prohibition of violation or further use — for instance, '''H.M.H.N.S.''' (''hoc monumentum heredem non sequetur'', this monument is not to pass to the heir). The person who has erected the monument and his relation to the deceased are often stated; or if a man has prepared the tomb in his lifetime, this also may be stated, '''V.S.F.''' (''vivus sibi fecit''). But there is an immense variety in the information that either a man himself or his friend may wish to record.&lt;ref name="Cour"/&gt;

====Milestones and boundaries====
Milestones (''[[Miliarium#Milestones and markers|miliaria]]'') have already been referred to, and may be regarded as records of the building of roads. Boundary stones (''[[Boundary marker|termini]]'') are frequently found, both of public and private property. A well-known instance is offered by those set up by the commissioners called '''III. viri A.I.A.''' (''agris iudicandis adsignandis'') in the time of the [[Gracchi]].&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

Latin inscriptions are the meeting point of [[Roman history]] and several arts. These are arts of expression or composition, writing in the strictly physical sense, and design or arrangement. The history is [[Roman history]] in its largest sense, involving men and women in many of their affairs, such as life and death, government, law, religious worship — all as illustrated above. The related fields one has to enter in order to fully appreciate the epigraphical study, are many: beside all aspects of Roman history, such more restricted but still large fields as ancient jewelry, [[Etruscology]], Italic and Latin [[philology]], ancient pottery, comparative [[palaeography]], Roman nomenclature, [[Latin verse]], [[lexicography]] (including inconsistencies of spelling, the early lack of a standard orthography0, Roman architecture and [[prosopography]], and the pronunciation of Greek as revealed by the rendering of Greek words in Latin inscriptions and of Latin words in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Arthur E. Gordon, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ywI6SDUggk4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true ''Latin Epigraphy''], [[University of California Press]], 1983, Introd., pp.3-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats''' ('''Hybrid CoE'''; {{lang-fi|Euroopan hybridiuhkien torjunnan osaamiskeskus}}) is an intergovernmental think tank based in [[Helsinki]], Finland, focusing on responses to [[Hybrid warfare|hybrid threats]] under the auspices of the [[European Union]] (EU) and [[NATO]].

== Function ==
Hybrid CoE  is described as an in-house think tank that conducts training courses, hosts workshops to policymakers and practitioners, and produces [[White paper|white papers]] on hybrid threats, such as weaknesses in an electrical grid or possible exploitation of vaguely written legislation. The Centre was formally established on 11 April 2017 under Finnish law with a [[memorandum of understanding]] between eight European states and the [[United States]] and in alignment with EU and NATO decisions. Three more European states signed the memorandum later. The Centre was inaugurated on 3 October 2017 and allotted a budget of 1.5 million [[Euro|euros]]. It is located in the [[Sörnäinen]] neighbourhood of Helsinki and was manned by fifteen persons in 2018 with international expert networks to support them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2017/20170417|title=Laki Euroopan hybridiuhkien torjunnan osaamiskeskuksesta 417/2017|last=|first=|date=2017-06-28|website=www.finlex.fi|language=fi|trans-title=Act on the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats 417/2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124070859/http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2017/20170417|archive-date=2018-01-24|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/18/inside-a-european-center-to-combat-russias-hybrid-warfare/|title=Inside a European Center to Combat Russia’s Hybrid Warfare|last=Standish|first=Reid|date=2018-01-18|website=Foreign Policy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123003129/http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/18/inside-a-european-center-to-combat-russias-hybrid-warfare/|archive-date=2018-01-23|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-01-22|quote=Located in an unassuming office building filled with boardrooms, lecture halls, and projectors in the Finnish capital, a new entity under the joint auspices of the European Union and NATO was founded with a herculean mission.

The '''Guildhall Lectures''' were an annual series of talks on the theme of communication, organised by the [[British Association]].

The lectures, held in the [[London Guildhall]], were sponsored and broadcast by [[Granada Television]].  The first set of three lectures were held in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;Asa Briggs, ''The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom, Vol. 5'', p.457&lt;/ref&gt; and they continued until at least 1984.  Broadly on the theme of "Communication in the Modern World", they concerned the [[arts]], [[science]]s, [[politics]] and [[mass media]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Curran et al, ''Television Today and Tomorrow'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SoborulZeitelor3Cucuteni.JPG|thumb|Possible Neolithic tattoo marks depicted on a Pre-[[Cucuteni culture]] clay figure from Romania, c. 4900–4750 BC]]
[[Tattoo]]ing has been practiced across the globe since at least [[Neolithic]] times, as evidenced by mummified preserved skin, ancient art and the archaeological record.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last=Deter-Wolf|first=Aaron|title=Tattoos and Body Modifications in Antiquity: Proceedings of the sessions at the EAA annual meetings in The Hague and Oslo, 2010/11|volume=9|year=2013|chapter=The Material Culture and Middle Stone Age Origins of Ancient Tattooing|publisher=Chronos Verlag|series=Zurich Studies in Archaeology|pages=15–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both ancient art and archaeological finds of possible tattoo tools suggest tattooing was practiced by the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period in Europe. However, direct evidence for tattooing on mummified human skin extends only to the [[4th millennium BC]]. The oldest discovery of tattooed human skin to date is found on the body of [[Ötzi the Iceman]], dating to between 3370 and 3100 BC.&lt;ref name="Oldest Tattoos"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deter-Wolf|first=Aaron|last2=Robitaille|first2=Benoît|last3=Krutak|first3=Lars|last4=Galliot|first4=Sébastien|title=The World's Oldest Tattoos|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science:Reports|volume=5|pages=19–24|date=February 2016|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X15301772|doi=10.1016/j.jasrep.2015.11.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other tattooed [[Mummy|mummies]] have been recovered from at least 49 archaeological sites, including locations in [[Greenland]], [[Alaska]], [[Siberia]], [[Mongolia]], western [[China]], [[Egypt]], [[Sudan]], the [[Philippines]] and the [[Andes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Deter-Wolf|first=Aaron|title=It’s official: Ötzi the Iceman has the oldest tattoos in the world|publisher=RedOrbit.com|date=11 November 2015|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1113410697/its-official-otzi-the-iceman-has-the-oldest-tattoos-in-the-world-111115/|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include Amunet, Priestess of the Goddess [[Hathor]] from [[ancient Egypt]] (c. 2134–1991 BC), multiple mummies from Siberia including the [[Pazyryk culture]] of Russia and from several cultures throughout [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] [[South America]].&lt;ref name="Oldest Tattoos" /&gt;

==Ancient and traditional practices==

===China===
Cemeteries throughout the [[Tarim Basin]] ([[Xinjiang]] of western [[China]]) including the sites of Qäwrighul, Yanghai, Shengjindian, Zaghunluq, and Qizilchoqa have revealed [[Tarim mummies|several tattooed mummies]] with Western Asian/Indo-European physical traits and cultural materials. These date from between 2100 and 550 BC.&lt;ref name="Oldest Tattoos" /&gt;

In ancient [[China]], tattoos were considered a barbaric practice, and were often referred to in literature depicting bandits and folk heroes. As late as the [[Qing Dynasty]],{{when|date=August 2013}}&lt;!--specifically--&gt; it was common practice to tattoo [[Chinese characters|characters]] such as {{lang|zh|囚}} ("Prisoner") on convicted criminals' faces. Although relatively rare during most periods of Chinese history, [[Slavery in China|slaves]] were also sometimes marked to display ownership.

However, tattoos seem to have remained a part of southern culture.  [[Marco Polo]] wrote of [[Quanzhou]], "Many come hither from Upper India to have their bodies painted with the needle in the way we have elsewhere described, there being many adepts at this craft in the city". At least three of the main characters {{ndash}} [[Lu Zhishen]], Shi Jin (史進), and Yan Ching (燕青) {{ndash}} in the classic novel ''[[Water Margin]]'' are described as having tattoos covering nearly all of their bodies. [[Wu Song]] was sentenced to a facial tattoo describing his crime after killing Xi Menqing (西門慶) to avenge his brother. In addition, [[Chinese mythology|Chinese legend]] claimed the mother of [[Yue Fei]] (a famous [[Song Dynasty|Song]] general) tattooed the words "Repay the Country with Pure Loyalty" ({{lang|zh|精忠報國}}, ''jing zhong bao guo'') down her son's back before he left to join the army.

===Greece and Rome===
[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] written records of tattooing date back to at least the 5th-century BCE.&lt;ref name="Oldest Tattoos" /&gt;{{rp|19}} The ancient Greeks and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used tattooing to penalize slaves, criminals, and prisoners of war. While known, decorative tattooing was looked down upon and religious tattooing was mainly practiced in [[Egypt#Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Syria#Classical antiquity|Syria]].&lt;ref name=Jones1987&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=C. P.|title=Stigma: Tattooing and branding in Graeco-Roman antiquity|journal=Journal of Roman Studies|date=1987|volume=77|pages=139–155|doi=10.2307/300578|url=https://doi.org/10.2307/300578|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155}} According to [[Robert Graves]] in his book ''The Greek Myths'', tattooing was common amongst certain religious groups in the ancient [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]] world, which may have contributed to the prohibition of tattooing in [[Leviticus]]. The Romans of [[Late Antiquity]] also tattooed soldiers and arms manufacturers, a practice that continued into the ninth century.&lt;ref name=Jones1987 /&gt;{{rp|155}}

The [[Greek language|Greek]] verb ''stizein'' (στίζειν), meaning "to prick," was used for tattooing. Its derivative ''stigma'' (στίγμα) was the common term for tattoo marks in both Greek and [[Latin]].&lt;ref name=Jones1987 /&gt;{{rp|142}} During the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]], the verb ''kentein'' (κεντεῖν) replaced ''stizein'', and a variety of new Latin terms replaced ''stigmata'' including ''signa'' "signs," ''characteres'' "stamps," and ''cicatrices'' "scars."&lt;ref name=Jones1987 /&gt;{{rp|154–155}}

===India===

In Southern [[India]], permanent tattoos are called ''pachakuthu''. It was very common in [[South India]], especially [[Tamil Nadu]], before 1980. In northern India, permanent tattoos are called ''godna''. Tattoos have been used as cultural symbols among many tribal populations, as well as the general [[Hindu]] population of India.

In India, tattoos have many names, including ''tarazwa'', ''gondan'', and ''ungkala''.

Several Indonesian tribes have tattooing in their culture. One notable example is the [[Dayak people]] of Kalimantan in Borneo ([[Bornean traditional tattooing]]). Another ethnic group that practices tattooing are the [[Mentawai people]], as well as Moi and Meyakh people in West Papua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rajaampatdoberai.com/unique-traditions-in-papua-including-raja-ampat/|title=UNIQUE TRADITIONS IN PAPUA, INCLUDING RAJA AMPAT - Raja Ampat Doberai|website=www.rajaampatdoberai.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tattooing for spiritual and decorative purposes in Japan is thought to extend back to at least the [[Jōmon]] or [[Paleolithic]] period and was widespread during various periods for both the Japanese and the native [[Ainu people|Ainu]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Chinese texts from before 300 AD described social differences among Japanese people as being indicated through tattooing and other bodiapanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of World Cultures CD-ROM|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/japan.htm |access-date=10 July 2015 |year=1998 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese texts from the time also described Japanese men of all ages as decorating their faces and bodies with tattoos.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2000&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Steve|title=Tattoo history: A source book|date=2000|publisher=Juno Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-890451-06-6|url=http://www.powerhousebooks.com/books/the-tattoo-history-source-book-paperback/|format=Paperback|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1603 and 1868, Japanese tattooing was only practiced by the ''[[ukiyo]]'' (floating world) subculture. Generally firemen, manual workers and prostitutes wore tattoos to communicate their status.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} By the early 17th century, criminals were widely being tattooed as a visible mark of punishment. Criminals were marked with symbols typically including crosses, lines, double lines and circles on certain parts of the body, mostly the face and arms. These symbols sometimes designated the places where the crimes were committed. In one area, the character for "dog" was tattooed on the criminal's forehead.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2000 /&gt;{{rp|77}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A history of Japanese tattooing|url=http://www.vanishingtattoo.com/tattoo_museum/chinese_japanese_tattoos.html|website=vanishingtattoo.com|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Meiji Japan]], formed in 1868, banned the art of tattooing altogether, viewing it as barbaric and lacking respectability. This subsequently created a subculture of criminals and outcasts. These people had no place in "decent society" and were frowned upon. They could not simply integrate into mainstream society because of their obvious visible tattoos, forcing many of them into criminal activities which ultimately formed the roots for the modern Japanese mafia, the Yakuza, with which tattoos have become almost synonymous in Japan.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Tattooing has been a part of Filipino life since pre-[[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Hispanic colonization]] of the [[Philippines|Philippine Islands]]. Tattooing in the Philippines, to some, were a form of rank and accomplishments, and some believed that tattoos had magical qualities. The more famous tattooed [[indigenous peoples of the Philippines]] resided in north [[Luzon]], especially among the [[Igorot people|Bontoc, Kalinga and Ifugao peoples]]. The [[Visayans]] of the southern islands were also heavily tattooed.

Filipino tattooing was first documented by the European Spanish explorers as they landed among the islands in the late 16th century, and they called the natives ''[[Pintados|Los Pintados]]'' (The Painted Ones) as they mistook the tattoos for paint. Before European exploration, tattooing was widespread, but conversion to Christianity greatly diminished the practice as heathen or low-class.

As Lane Wilcken's ''Filipino Tattoos Ancient to Modern'' denotes, there are many similarities between the tattooing traditions of the Philippines and indigenous Polynesian designs – not only with their societal function and similar designs, but in the tools used to hand-tap them  a needle or thorn on a stick, with a hammer to pound it into the skin). While the most common modern term for indigenous tattoos is ''batok,'' an ancient [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word for tattoos was ''tatak,'' extremely similar to the Samoan word ''tatau''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The [[Māori people]] of [[New Zealand]] practised a form of tattooing known as [[tā moko]], traditionally created with chisels.

However, from the late 20th century onward, there has been a resurgence of tā moko taking on European styles amongst Maori. Traditional tā moko was reserved for head area. There is also a related tattoo art, kirituhi, which has a similar aesthetic to tā moko but is worn by non-Maori.

====Samoa====
The traditional male tattoo in Samoa is called the [[pe'a]]. The traditional female tattoo is called the [[malu]]. The word ''tattoo'' is believed to have originated from the Samoan word ''tatau.'' {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

When the [[Samoan Islands]] were first seen by Europeans in 1722 three Dutch ships commanded by Jacob Roggeveen visited the eastern island known as Manua. A crew member of one of the ships described the natives in these words, "They are friendly in their speech and courteous in their behavior, with no apparent trace of wildness or savagery. They do not paint themselves, as do the natives of some other islands, but on the lower part of the body they wear artfully woven silk tights or knee breeches. They are altogether the most charming and polite natives we have seen in all of the South Seas..."{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The ships lay at anchor off the islands for several days, but the crews did not venture ashore and did not even get close enough to the natives to realize that they were not wearing silk leggings, but their legs were completely covered in [[tattoos]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
[[File:Back view Samoan male tatau - photo Thomas Andrew - 1890s.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Back view of a [[Samoans|Samoan]] man with tattoos (c. 1890)]]
In Samoa, the tradition of applying [[tattoo]], or tatau, by hand has been unbroken for over two thousand years. Tools and techniques have changed little. The skill is often passed from father to son, each [[tattoo]] artist, or tufuga, learning the craft over many years of serving as his father's apprentice. A young artist-in-training often spent hours, and sometimes days, tapping designs into sand or tree bark using a special [[tattooing]] comb, or au. Honoring their tradition, Samoan tattoo artists made this tool from sharpened boar's teeth fastened together with a portion of the turtle shell and to a wooden handle. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Traditional Samoan tattooing of the "pe'a", body tattoo, is an ordeal that is not lightly undergone. It takes many weeks to complete. The process is very painful and used to be a necessary prerequisite to receiving a matai title; this however is no longer the case. [[Tattooing]] was also a very costly procedure.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Samoan society has long been defined by rank and title, with chiefs (ali'i) and their assistants, known as talking chiefs (tulafale). The tattooing ceremonies for young chiefs, typically conducted at the time of puberty, were part of their ascendance to a leadership role. The permanent marks left by the [[tattoo]] artists would forever celebrate their endurance and dedication to cultural traditions. The pain was extreme and the risk of death by infection was a concern; to back down from tattooing was to risk being labeled a "pala'ai" or coward. Those who could not endure the pain and abandoned their tattooing were left incomplete, would be forced to wear their mark of shame throughout their life. This would forever bring shame upon their family so it was avoided at all cost. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The Samoan tattooing process used a number of tools which remained almost unchanged since their first use. "Autapulu" is a wide tattooing comb used to fill in the large dark areas of the tattoo. "Ausogi'aso tele" is a comb used for making thick lines. "Ausogi'aso laititi" is a comb used for making thin lines. "Aumogo" small comb is used for making small marks. "Sausau" is the mallet is used for striking the combs. It is almost two feet in length and made from the central rib of a coconut palm leaf. "Tuluma" is the pot used for holding the tattooing combs. Ipulama is the cup used for holding the dye. The dye is made from the soot collected from burnt lama nuts. "Tu'I"  used to grind up the dye. These tools were primarily made out of animal bones to ensure sharpness.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The tattooing process itself would be 5 sessions, in theory. These 5 sessions would be spread out over 10 days in order for the inflammation to subside.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Christian missionaries from the west attempted to purge tattooing among the Samoans, thinking it barbaric and inhumane. Many young Samoans resisted mission schools since they forbade them to wear tattoos. But over time attitudes relaxed toward this cultural tradition and tattooing began to reemerge in Samoan culture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Solomon Islands===
Some artifacts dating back 3,000 years from the [[Solomon Islands]] may have been used for tattooing human skin. [[Obsidian]] pieces have been duplicated, then used to conduct tattoos on pig skin, then compared to the original artifacts. "They conducted these experiments to observe the wear, such as chipping and scratches, and residues on the stones caused by tattooing, and then compared that use-wear with 3,000 year old artifacts. They found that the obsidian pieces, old and new, show similar patterns, suggesting that they hadn't been used for working hides, but were for adorning human skin."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/issues/235-1611/world "World Roundup"] 2016.

Thai tattoos, also known as Yantra tattooing, was common since ancient times. Just as other native southeast Asian cultures, animistic tattooing was common in [[Tai peoples|Tai]] tribes that were is southern China. Over time, this animistic practice of tattooing for luck and protection assimilated Hindu and Buddhist ideas. The Sak Yant traditional tattoo is practiced today by many and are usually given either by a Buddhist monk or a [[Brahmin]] priest. The tattoos usually depict Hindu gods and use the [[Old Mon script|Mon script]] or ancient [[Khmer alphabet|Khmer script]], which were the scripts of the classical civilizations of mainland southeast Asia.

Pre-Christian [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Celts|Celtic]] and other central and northern European tribes were often heavily tattooed, according to surviving accounts, but it may also have been normal paint. The [[Picts]] may have been tattooed (or [[Scarification|scarified]]) with elaborate, war-inspired black or dark blue [[woad]] (or possibly [[copper]] for the blue tone) designs. [[Julius Caesar]] described these tattoos in Book V of his ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|Gallic Wars]]'' (54 BC). Nevertheless, these may have been painted markings rather than tattoos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carr|first1=Gillian|title=Woad, Tattooing and Identity in Later Iron Age and Early Roman Britain|journal=Oxford Journal of Archaeology|date=2005|volume=24|issue=3|pages=273–292|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0092.2005.00236.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]] wrote of his encounter with the [[Scandinavia]]n [[Rus' people|Rus']] tribe in the early 10th century, describing them as tattooed from "fingernails to neck" with dark blue "tree patterns" and other "figures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/viktatoo.shtml|title= Viking Answers|accessdate=2009-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this may also have been paint, since the word used can mean both tattoo and painting. During the gradual process of [[Christianization of Europe|Christianization in Europe]], tattoos were often considered remaining elements of [[paganism]] and generally legally prohibited.

The significance of tattooing was long open to Eurocentric interpretations. In the mid-19th century, [[Baron Haussmann]], while arguing against painting the interior of Parisian churches, said the practice "reminds me of the tattoos used in place of clothes by barbarous peoples to conceal their nakedness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Michel | last = Carmona | pages = 235–6 | title = Haussmann: His Life and Times and the Making of Modern Paris | date = 2002 | publisher = Ivan R.

===Great Britain===
British and other pilgrims to the [[Holy Lands]] throughout the 17th century were tattooed to commemorate their voyages, including [[William Lithgow (traveller and author)|William Lithgow]] in 1612. {{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In 1691, [[William Dampier]] brought to London a native of the [[Western New Guinea|western part]] of [[New Guinea]] (now part of [[Indonesia]]) who had a tattooed body and became known as the "Painted Prince".

Between 1766 and 1779, Captain [[James Cook]] made three voyages to the South Pacific, the last trip ending with Cook's death in Hawaii in February 1779. When Cook and his men returned home to Europe from their voyages to [[Polynesia]], they told tales of the 'tattooed savages' they had seen. The word "tattoo" itself comes from the [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] ''tatau'', and was introduced into the [[English language]] by Cook's expedition (though the word 'tattoo' or 'tap-too', referring to a drumbeat, had existed in English since at least 1644)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hine|first1=Thomas Chambers|title=Nottingham: its castle: a military fortress, a royal palace, a ducal mansion, a blackened ruin, a museum and gallery of art|date=1876|publisher=Hamilton, Adams|location=London|page=Appendix|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/imgsrv/download/pdf?id=njp.32101075991255;orient=0;size=100;seq=253;attachment=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in Tahiti aboard the ''[[HMS Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', in July 1769, that Cook first noted his observations about the indigenous body modification and is the first recorded use of the word tattoo to refer to the permanent marking of the skin. In the ship's log book recorded this entry: "Both sexes paint their Bodys, Tattow, as it is called in their Language. This is done by inlaying the Colour of Black under their skins, in such a manner as to be indelible." Cook went on to write, "This method of Tattowing I shall now describe...As this is a painful operation, especially the Tattowing of their Buttocks, it is performed but once in their Lifetimes."

Cook's Science Officer and Expedition Botanist, Sir [[Joseph Banks]], returned to England with a tattoo. Banks was a highly regarded member of the English aristocracy and had acquired his position with Cook by putting up what was at the time the princely sum of some ten thousand pounds in the expedition. In turn, Cook brought back with him a tattooed [[Raiatea]]n man, [[Omai]], whom he presented to King George and the English Court. Many of Cook's men, ordinary seamen and sailors, came back with tattoos, a tradition that would soon become associated with men of the sea in the public's mind and the press of the day.&lt;ref&gt;A description of three of the men who took part in the [[Mutiny on the Bounty]] in 1789 refers to their being tattooed on the left breast, arms and 'backside' with designs such as stars, hearts, 'darts' and, in the case of a [[Isle of Man|Manxman]], the [[triskelion]] [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/museum/additional_image_types.asp?extra_image_type_id=2&amp;image_id=39 nationalarchives.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, sailors and seamen re-introduced the practice of tattooing in Europe, and it spread rapidly to seaports around the globe.

By the 19th century, tattooing had spread to British society but was still largely associated with sailors&lt;ref&gt;"The reason why sailors tattoo themselves has often been asked." The Times (London), 30 January 1873, p. 10: The article describes recovery of bodies after a shipwreck:those of the crew were identifiable by their tattoos.&lt;/ref&gt; and the lower or even criminal class.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London), 3 April 1879, p. 9: "Crime has a ragged regiment in its pay so far as the outward ... qualities are concerned ... they tattoo themselves indelibly ... asserting the man's identity with the aid of needles and gunpowder. This may be the explanation of the Mermaids, the Cupid's arrows, the name of MARY, the tragic inscription to the memory of parents, the unintended pathos of the appeal to liberty."&lt;/ref&gt; Tattooing had however been practised in an amateur way by public schoolboys from at least the 1840s&lt;ref&gt;During the [[Tichborne case]], a witness, Lord Bellew, testified he and the missing Roger Tichborne tattooed each other while they were both schoolboys at [[Stonyhurst College]].

Article describes the activities of an unnamed Japanese tattooist based in Hong Kong. He charged £4 for a dragon, which would take 5 hours to do. The article ends "The Hong-Kong operator tattooed the arm of an English Prince, and, in Kioto, was engaged for a whole month reproducing on the trunk and limbs of an English peer a series of scenes from Japanese history. For this he was paid about £100. He has also tattooed ladies.... His income from tattooing in Hong Kong is about £1,200 per annum."&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes painful&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Broadwell|first=Albert H.|title=Sporting pictures on the human skin|journal=Country Life|date=27 January 1900}} "In especially sensitive cases a mild solution of cocaine is injected under the skin, ... and no sensation whatever is felt, while the soothing solution is so mild that it has no effect ... except locally."&lt;/ref&gt; process.

Tattooing spread among the upper classes all over Europe in the 19th century, but particularly in Britain where it was estimated in Harmsworth Magazine in 1898 that as many as one in five members of the gentry were tattooed. Taking their lead from the British Court, where [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] followed [[Edward VII|Edward VII's]] lead in getting tattooed; King [[Frederick IX of Denmark|Frederick IX]] of [[Denmark]], the King of [[Romania]], [[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]], [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander of Yugoslavia]] and even [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] of [[Russia]], all sported tattoos, many of them elaborate and ornate renditions of the Royal Coat of Arms or the Royal Family Crest. [[King Alfonso XIII]] of modern [[Spain]] also had a tattoo.

The perception that there is a marked class division on the acceptability of the practice has been a popular media theme in Britain, as successive generations of journalists described the practice as newly fashionable and no longer for a marginalised class. Examples of this cliché can be found in every decade since the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cawley|first1=Lawrence|title=People always say the same thing about tattoos|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25330947|work=BBC News Magazine|publisher=BBC|date=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this evidence, a myth persists that the upper and lower classes find tattooing attractive and the broader middle classes rejecting it. In 1969, the [[House of Lords]] debated a bill to ban the tattooing of minors, on grounds it had become "trendy" with the young in recent years but was associated with crime. It was noted that 40 per cent of young criminals had tattoos and that marking the skin in this way tended to encourage self-identification with criminal groups. Two peers, [[Baron Teynham|Lord Teynham]] and the [[Dudley Gordon, 3rd Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair]] however rose to object that they had been tattooed as youngsters, with no ill effects.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London), 29 April 1969, p. 4: "Saving young from embarrassing tattoos".&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s, tattoos have become more socially acceptable and fashionable among celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24296713|title=Why do people go back for more and more tattoos?|first=Jon|last=Kelly|date=1 October 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tattoos are less prominent on figures of authority, and the practice of tattooing by the elderly is still considered remarkable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24906132|title=Dimbleby gets first tattoo aged 75|date=12 November 2013|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northeastern North America in the 17th century===
The [[Jesuit Relations]] of 1652 describes tattooing among the [[Petun]] and the [[Neutrals]]:
{{quote|
But those who paint themselves permanently do so with extreme pain, using,
for this purpose, needles, sharp awls, or piercing thorns, with which they
perforate, or have others perforate, the skin. Thus they form on the face, the
neck, the breast, or some other part of the body, some animal or monster, for
instance, an Eagle, a Serpent, a Dragon, or any other figure which they prefer;
and then, tracing over the fresh and bloody design some powdered charcoal, or
other black coloring matter, which becomes mixed with the blood and penetrates
within these perforations, they imprint indelibly upon the living skin the
designed figures. And this in some nations is so common that in the one which
we called the Tobacco, and in that which -- on account of enjoying peace with
the Hurons and with the Iroquois -- was called Neutral, I know not whether a
single individual was found, who was not painted in this manner, on some part
of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://puffin.creighton.edu/jesuit/relations/relations_38.html|title=home|date=11 August 2014|website=puffin.creighton.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===North America===
[[File:Body art, 1907 black n white.jpg|thumb|[[Maud Wagner|Mrs. M. Stevens Wagner]], one of the earliest [[Tattooed Ladies]] that performed in the circus sideshows, 1907]]

In the period shortly after the [[American Revolution]], to avoid [[impressment]] by British Navy ships, sailors used government issued [[protection papers]] to establish their American citizenship. However, many of the descriptions of the individual described in the seamen's protection certificates were so general, and it was so easy to abuse the system, that many impressment officers of the [[Royal Navy]] simply paid no attention to them. "In applying for a duplicate Seaman's Protection Certificate in 1817, James Francis stated that he 'had a protection granted him by the Collector of this Port on or about 12 March 1806 which was torn up and destroyed by a British Captain when at sea.'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1992/spring/seamans-protection.html "Genealogical Fallout from the War of 1812."] By Ruth Priest Dixon. Prologue Magazine. Spring 1992. Volume 24 (1).&lt;/ref&gt;

One way of making them more specific and more effective was to describe a tattoo, which is highly personal as to subject and location, and thus use that description to precisely identify the seaman. As a result, many of the official certificates also carried information about tattoos and scars, as well as any other specific identifying information. This also perhaps led to an increase and proliferation of tattoos among American seamen who wanted to avoid impressment. During this period, tattoos were not popular with the rest of the country. "Frequently the "protection papers" made reference to tattoos, clear evidence that individual was a seafaring man; rarely did members of the general public adorn themselves with tattoos."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Gene Allan. 2013. The Slave's Gamble. MacMillan. Page 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

"In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, [[tattoo]]s were as much about self-expression as they were about having a unique way to identify a sailor's body should he be lost at sea or impressed by the British navy. The best source for early American tattoos is the [[protection papers]] issued following a 1796 congressional act to safeguard American seamen from impressment. These proto-[[passport]]s catalogued tattoos alongside [[birthmark]]s, [[scar]]s, race, and height. Using simple techniques and tools, tattoo artists in the early republic typically worked on board ships using anything available as [[pigment]]s, even [[gunpowder]] and [[urine]]. Men marked their arms and hands with initials of themselves and loved ones, significant dates, symbols of the seafaring life, liberty poles, crucifixes, and other symbols."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.common-place.org/vol-12/no-01/reviews/mcneur.shtml|title=Common-place › The journal of early American lifeCommon-place: The Journal of early American Life|work=common-place.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, to protect themselves, the sailors requested not only that the tattoos be described, but that they would also be sketched out on the protection certificate as well. As one researched said, "Clerks writing the documents often sketched the tattoos as well as describing them."&lt;ref&gt;Dye, Ira. "The Tattoos of Early American Seafarers, 1796-1818." Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society. 133.4 (1989): 520-554.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indigenous People of North America ====
[[Indigenous people of North America|Indigenous People of North America]] have a long history of tattooing.

The [[Inuit people|Inuit People]] have a deep history of tattooing.

===== Osage Nation =====
The [[Osage people|Osage People]] used tattooing for a variety of different reasons.  The tattoo designs were based on the belief that people were part of the larger cycle of life and integrated elements of the land, sky, water, and the space in between to symbolize these beliefs.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Drawing with Great Needles: Ancient Tattoo Traditions of North America|last=Dye|first=David H.|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Deter-Wolf|editor-first=Aaron|location=Austin|pages=215-251|chapter=Snaring Life from the Star and the Sun|editor-last2=Diaz-Granados|editor-first2=Carlos}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|222-228}}  In addition, the Osage People believed in the smaller cycle of life, recognizing the importance of women giving life through childbirth and men removing life through warfare.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;{{Rp|216}}  Osage men were often tattooed after accomplishing major feats in battle, as a visual and physical reminder of their elevated status in their community.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;{{Rp|223}}  Some Osage women were tattooed in public as a form of a prayer, demonstrating strength and dedication to their nation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;{{Rp|223}}

Tattoo historian Anna Felicity Friedman suggests a couple reasons for the "Cook Myth".&lt;ref name=Friedman2012 /&gt;{{rp|18–20}} First, modern European words for the practice (e.g., "tattoo", "tatuaje", "tatouage", "Tätowierung", and "tatuagem") derive from the Tahitian word "tatau", which was introduced to European languages through Cook's travels. However, prior European texts show that a variety of metaphorical terms were used for the practice, including "pricked," "marked", "engraved," "decorated," "punctured," "stained," and "embroidered." Friedman also points out that the growing print culture at the time of Cook's voyages may have increased the visibility of tattooing despite its prior existence in the West.

===Pre-1960s===
The first documented professional [[tattoo artist|tattooer]] in the [[United States]] was [[Martin Hildebrandt]], a [[Germany|German]] immigrant who arrived in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] in 1846.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Between 1861 and 1865, he tattooed soldiers on both sides in the [[American Civil War]]. The first documented professional tattooist (with a permanent studio, working on members of the paying public) in Britain was [[Sutherland Macdonald]] in the early 1880s. Tattooing was an expensive and painful process and by the late 1880s had become a mark of wealth for the crowned heads of Europe.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In 1891, [[New York City|New York]] tattooer [[Samuel O'Reilly]] patented the first electric [[tattoo machine]], a modification of [[Thomas Edison|Thomas Edison's]] [[electric pen]].

[[File:Nora Hildebrandt, by Charles Eisenmann.jpg|thumb|left|Nora Hildebrandt]]
The earliest appearance of tattoos on women during this period were in the [[circus]] in the late 19th century. These "[[Tattooed Ladies]]" were covered — with the exception of their faces, hands, necks, and other readily visible areas — with various images inked into their skin. In order to lure the crowd, the earliest ladies, like [[Betty Broadbent]] and Nora Hildebrandt told tales of captivity; they usually claimed to have been taken hostage by Native Americans that tattooed them as a form of torture. However, by the late 1920s the sideshow industry was slowing and by the late 1990s the last tattooed lady was out of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Osterud|first1=Amelia Klem|title=The tattooed lady: A history|date=2009|publisher=Speck Press|location=Golden, CO|isbn=978-1933108261|format=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Tattoo Renaissance===
Although tattooing has steadily increased in popularity since the invention of the electric tattoo machine, it was not until the 1960s that the place of tattooing in popular culture radically shifted.&lt;ref&gt;Nyssen, Carmen.

Since the 1970s, tattoos have become a mainstream part of global and Western fashion, common among both sexes, to all economic classes, and to age groups from the later teen years to middle age. The decoration of blues singer [[Janis Joplin]] with a wrist let and a small heart on her left breast, by the [[San Francisco]] tattoo artist [[Lyle Tuttle]], has been called a seminal moment in the popular acceptance of tattoos as art. Formal interest in the art of the tattoo became prominent in the 1970s through the beginning of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Deb Tattooing has also become a fad among celebrities. [[David Beckham]], an international soccer star, caught tattoo ‘fever’ beginning with the birth of his first son back in 1999 when he had Malloy ink his son’s name, "Brooklyn" at the bottom of his back. Acord. (19 November 2006). "Who knew: Mommy has a tattoo". ''Maine Sunday Telegram''.&lt;/ref&gt; For many young Americans, the tattoo has taken on a decidedly different meaning than for previous generations. The tattoo has "undergone dramatic redefinition" and has shifted from a form of deviance to an acceptable form of expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Roberts, DJ. |title=Secret Ink: Tattoo's Place in Contemporary American Culture|journal= Journal of American Culture|volume= 35|number=2 |year=2012|pages= 153–65|type= Print|doi=10.1111/j.1542-734x.2012.00804.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, scholar Arnold Rubin created a collection of works regarding the history of tattoo cultures, publishing them as the "Marks of Civilization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Rubin|editor1-first=Arnold|title=Marks of civilization: Artistic transformations of the human body|date=1988|publisher=Museum of Cultural History, University of California, Los Angeles|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-930741-12-9|format=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, the term "Tattoo Renaissance" was coined, referring to a period marked by technological, artistic and social change.&lt;ref name="Schildkrout, Enid 2004"/&gt; Wearers of tattoos, as members of the [[counterculture]] began to display their body art as signs of resistance to the values of the white, heterosexual, middle-class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeMello|first=Margo|title=Bodies of inscription: A cultural history of the modern tattoo community|date=2000|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|isbn=978-0-8223-2467-6|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/Bodies-of-Inscription/index-viewby=title.html|format=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clientele changed from sailors, bikers, and gang members to the middle and upper class. There was also a shift in iconography from the badge-like images based on repetitive pre-made designs known as [[Flash (tattoo)|flash]] to customized full-body tattoo influenced by Polynesian and Japanese tattoo art, known as [[Sleeve tattoo|sleeves]], which are categorized under the relatively new and popular [[avant-garde]] genre.&lt;ref name="Schildkrout, Enid 2004"/&gt; Tattooers transformed into "Tattoo Artists": men and women with fine art backgrounds began to enter the profession alongside the older, traditional tattooists.

Tattoos have experienced a resurgence in popularity in many parts of the world, particularly in Europe, Japan, and North and South America. The growth in tattoo culture has seen an influx of new artists into the industry, many of whom have technical and fine arts training. Coupled with advancements in tattoo pigments and the ongoing refinement of the equipment used for tattooing, this has led to an improvement in the quality of tattoos being produced.&lt;ref name=Mifflin1997&gt;{{cite book|last=Mifflin|first=Margot|authorlink=Margot Mifflin|title=Bodies of subversion: A secret history of women and tattoo|date=1997|publisher=Juno Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-89045-100-4|format=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Star Stowe]] (Miss February 1977) was the first [[Playboy Playmate]] with a visible tattoo on her centerfold.

During the 2000s, the presence of tattoos became evident within [[Popular culture|pop culture]], inspiring television shows such as [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]]'s ''[[Inked]]'' and [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]]'s ''[[Miami Ink]]'' and ''[[LA Ink]]''. In addition, many celebrities have made tattoos more acceptable in recent years.

Contemporary art exhibitions and visual art institutions have featured tattoos as art through such means as displaying [[Flash (tattoo)|tattoo flash]], examining the works of tattoo artists, or otherwise incorporating examples of [[body art]] into mainstream exhibits. One such 2009 Chicago exhibition, ''Freaks &amp; Flash'', featured both examples of historic body art as well as the tattoo artists who produced it.&lt;ref&gt;The Chicago art exhibition, [http://www.art.org/exhibitions/archives/2009/tattoo.htm ''Freaks &amp; Flash''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227131447/http://www.art.org/exhibitions/archives/2009/tattoo.htm |date=27 February 2012 }}, for example, juxtaposed circus sideshow banners depicting tattooed performers like "The Tattooed Lady" alongside art inspired by the tattoo Renaissance of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, 25% of Australians under age 30 had tattoos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brittany |first=By |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/fashion/im-inked-therefore-i-am-why-tatts-have-left-a-mark-on-gen-y/story-e6frfn7i-1225945591327 |title=I'm inked therefore I am: Why tatts have left a mark on Gen Y |publisher=News.com.au |date=31 October 2010 |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mattel]] released a tattooed [[Barbie doll]] in 2011, which was widely accepted, although it did attract some controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/152414/barbie-tattoos-lead-to-predictable-media-hysteria-world-to-end-soon/ |title=Barbie Tattoos Lead to Predictable Media Hysteria, World to End Soon |publisher=Inquisitr.com |date=20 October 2011 |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past three decades Western tattooing has become a practice that has crossed social boundaries from "low" to "high" class along with reshaping the power dynamics regarding gender. It has its roots in "exotic" tribal practices of the Native Americans and Japanese, which are still seen in present times.

As various kinds of social movements progressed bodily inscription crossed class boundaries, and became common among the general public. Specifically, the tattoo is one access point for revolutionary aesthetics of women. [[Feminist theory]] has much to say on the subject. "Bodies of Subversion: A Secret History of Women and Tattoo", by [[Margot Mifflin]], became the first history of women's tattoo art when it was released in 1997. In it, she documents women's involvement in tattooing coinciding to feminist successes, with surges in the 1880s, 1920s and the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Mifflin1997" /&gt; Today, women sometimes use tattoos as forms of bodily reclamation after traumatic experiences like abuse or breast cancer.&lt;ref name="Mifflin1997" /&gt; In 2012, tattooed women outnumbered men for the first time in American history - according to a [[Harris poll]], 23% of women in America had tattoos in that year, compared to 19% of men.&lt;ref&gt;Braverman, Samantha. "One in Five U.S. Adults Now Has a Tattoo." Harris Interactive: Harris Polls. N.p, 23 February  2012. Web. 7 February  2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Miss Kansas, [[Theresa Vail]], became the first Miss America contestant to show off tattoos during the swimsuit competition — the insignia of the U.S. Army Dental Corps on her left shoulder and one of the "[[Serenity Prayer]]" along the right side of her torso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/wp/2013/09/10/the-tattooed-miss-kansas-and-other-miss-america-firsts/ | work=The Washington Post | title=The Reliable Source}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, William Mullane of [[London]] was tattooed with a portrait of his late father which used ink mixed with a small portion of his father's [[Cremation|ashes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent_messenger/news/son-uses-dads-ashes-in-4774/ |title=Grieving son William Mullane asks Maidstone tattoo artist Brendan Mudd to create artwork from dad's ashes |author=Angela Cole |publisher=kentonline.co.uk |date=16 August 2013 |accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal status of tattoos is still developing. In recent years, various lawsuits have arisen in the United States regarding the status of tattoos as a copyrightable art form. However, these cases have either been settled out of court or are currently being disputed, and therefore no legal precedent exists directly on point.&lt;ref&gt;http://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/ilr-content/articles/2013/1/Cummings.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The process of tattooing was held to be a purely expressive activity protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] by the [[Ninth Circuit]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anderson v. City of Hermosa Beach]], 621 F. 3d 1051 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Militaries from around the world ==
Throughout the world's different military branches, tattoos are either regulated under policies or strictly prohibited to fit dress code rules.

=== United States of America ===

==== [[United States Air Force]] ====

The United States Air Force regulates all kinds of body modification. Any tattoos which are deemed to be "prejudicial to good order and discipline", or "of a nature that may bring discredit upon the Air Force" are prohibited. Specifically, any tattoo which may be construed as "obscene or advocate sexual, racial, ethnic or religious discrimination" is disallowed. Tattoo removal may not be enough to qualify; resultant "excessive scarring" may be disqualifying. Further, Air Force members may not have tattoos on their neck, face, head, tongue, lips or scalp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AF evolves policies to access more talent, maintain high standards|url=http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/1045846/af-evolves-policies-to-access-more-talent-maintain-high-standards.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Face tattoos are also permitted as permanent eyeliners for females as long as they are appropriately worn and not brightly colored to fit uniform dressing code. Disrespectful derogatory tattoos and sexually explicit are prohibited on the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscg.mil/directives/ci/1000-1999/CI_1000_1B.pdf|title=COMMANDANT INSTRUCTION 1000.1B|last=|first=|date=31 August 2009|website=TATTOO, BODY MARKING, BODY PIERCING, AND MUTILATION POLICY|publisher=United States Coast Guard|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== [[United States Marines]] ====

The United States Marine Corps has disclosed a new policy meeting their new standards of professionalism in the military appearance, on the Marine Corps Bulletin 1020 released on 6 February 2016, substituting any previous policy from the past''.''&lt;ref name="Marine Corps Tattoos"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marines.mil/tattoos.aspx?pid=HPTattooPolicy|title=Marine Corps Tattoos|website=www.marines.mil|access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tattooed sailor aboard the USS New Jersey.jpg|thumb|Tattooed sailor aboard the {{w|USS New Jersey (BB-62)|USS ''New Jersey'' (1944).]]

The United States Navy has changed its policies{{when|date=April 2018}} and become more lenient when it comes to tattoos. For the first time the navy is allowing sailors to have neck tattoos as long as one inch. Sailors will also be allowed to have as many tattoos of any size on the arms, and legs as long as they are not deemed to be offensive tattoos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/ah_online/ftrStory.asp?id=93927|title=New Tattoo Policy|access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===

The Indian Army tattoo policy has been in place since 11 May 2015. The government declared all tribal communities who enlist and have tattoos, are allowed to have them all over the body only if they belong to a tribal community. Indians who are not part of a tribal community are only allowed to have tattoos in designated parts of the body such as the forearm, elbow, wrist, the side of the palm, and back and front of hands. Offensive sexist and racist tattoos are not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://armycalling.com/tattoo-policy-in-the-indian-army/|title=Tattoo Policy In The Indian Army|date=9 March 2016|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Great Britain ===

The British army has changed its policy from restricting visible body art around the neck and other parts of the body, in an attempt to stop turning people away, and bring in new recruits, with a policy starting in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2777588/Body-art-war-Army-lifts-ban-hand-neck-tattoos-struggling-attract-new-recruits.html|title=Body art of war: Army lifts ban on hand and neck tattoos after struggling to attract new recruits|work=Daily Mail|access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was founded in 1969 by a consortium of universities in Eastern Canada, and several government departments, who pooled their resources in order to provide field research and teaching facilities that would complement their programs in [[marine biology]] and [[oceanography]]. The Huntsman Marine Laboratory was established on {{convert|20|acres}} of land that was provided by Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and included two residential buildings that were called the Ambridge Estate. The government assisted with the purchase of the Sir Thomas Tait Estate which included another 50 acres, and the large Anderson House, which provides accommodation for visiting students. A public [[aquarium]] opened in 1972. The name was changed to Huntsman Marine Science Centre in 1987.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huntsmanmarine.ca/html/history.html |title=History |publisher=Huntsman Marine Science Centre |accessdate=13 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429030114/http://www.huntsmanmarine.ca/html/history.html |archivedate=29 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991 and again in 1999, the HMSC was awarded the [[Gulf of Maine]] Visionary Award.&lt;ref name="ic.gc.ca2011" /&gt;

Key types of impact assessments include global assessments (global level), policy impact assessment (policy level), strategic environmental assessment (programme and plan level), and [[environmental impact assessment]] (project level). Impact assessments can focus on specific themes, such as [[social impact assessment]]s and gender impact assessments.

IAs can improve legislation by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=Klaus|author2=Ferretti, Johanna |author3=Guske, Anna-Lena |author4=Turnpenny, John |author5=Jordan, Andrew |author6= Adelle, Camilla |title=Sustainability in Impact Assessments A Review of Impact Assessment Systems in selected OECD countries and the European Commission|journal=OECD|date=2011|volume=SG/SD(2011)6/FINAL|url=http://www.oecd.org/gov/regulatory-policy/Sustainability%20in%20impact%20assessment%20SG-SD%282011%296-FINAL.pdf|accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Informing policy makers about potential economic, social, and environmental ramifications
* Improving transparency so that contributions to sustainability and "better regulation" are disclosed and [[Special Interest Group|special interest]] [[lobbying]] is discouraged
* Increasing public participation in order to reflect a range of considerations, thereby improving the legitimacy of policies
* Clarifying how public policy helps achieve its goals and priorities through policy indicators
* Contributing to continuous learning in policy development by identifying causalities that inform ex-post review of policies

== Procedure ==
The department which is responsible for the policy proposal usually has to carry out the IA. Although the purpose and orientation of IA procedures differ, IA guidelines in the various jurisdictions all follow a similar set of steps to be followed by desk officers:
# Planning of the IA
# Carrying out the impact analysis
# Consultation of affected stakeholders and the general public
# Coordination with affected departments
# Summary and presentation of findings in a report
# Forwarding findings to decision makers
# Publication of the IA report (not in all countries)

The analytical steps, which mainly relate to step 2, can be set out as
i.	Problem definition
ii.	Definition of policy objectives
iii.	Development of policy options
iv.	Analysis of impacts
v.	Comparison of policy options and recommendation of one option
vi.	Defining monitoring measures.

== Methods ==
Throughout the IA process, methods can be used for support. In recent years governments have increasingly invested in developing and applying methods and tools for IA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Podhora|first=Aranka |author2=Helming, K |author3=Adenäuer, L. |author4=Heckelei, T. |author5=Kautto, P. |author6=Reidsma, P. |author7=Rennings, K. |author8=Turnpenny, J. |author9=Jansen, J.|title=).

Depending on usage, IA methods can be classified as methods for
* Scoping (e.g., checklists)
* For qualitative analysis (e.g., [[focus groups]])
* For quantitative analysis (e.g., [[life-cycle assessment]], [[material flow accounting]], modelling)
* Aggregation and comparison of options (e.g., [[cost–benefit analysis]])
* Analysing coherence (e.g., Gender IA)
* Supporting participation and involvement (e.g., internet consultation)
* Data presentation and involvement (e.g., [[GIS]])
* [[Monitoring and evaluation]] (e.g., indicators)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=LIAISE – Network of Excellence|title=LIAISE KIT – Knowledge for Decision Making|url=http://www.liaise-kit.eu/|accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute for Social and Economic Change''' ('''ISEC''') is a social science [[research institute]] in [[Bangalore]], [[India]]. Founded in 1972, it is the largest among the 27 institutions supported by [[Indian Council of Social Science Research]] (ICSSR). 

ISEC is one of three major institutions established by Prof. [[V. K. R. V. Rao]], along with the [[Delhi School of Economics]] and the [[Institute of Economic Growth]], Delhi.

==Institute for Social and Economic Change==
(ISEC) multi-disciplinary [[social science]] research institute established by Prof. V.K.R.V Rao in 1972, funded by the Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) and the [[Government of Karnataka]]. The thrust of the institute is to integrate the social science research skills in initiating, complementing, participating and furthering the social, economic and political changes of the societies with an emphasis on equity and justice. Prof. Rao’s vision was to build purposeful interactions within social science disciplines as well as with other [[List of life sciences|life science]] streams to create a strong [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] work. ISEC’s concern for the social and economic welfare of the poor and disadvantaged groups reflects strongly in the large number of studies it has undertaken to understand the various dimensions of [[poverty]] and human development.  Analytical and applied research studies particularly in policy-related areas have also been areas of priority at ISEC.  Central, state and local level governments have come to rely on the Institute for evaluation of various policies and programmes. 

ISEC has also developed some very prestigious and valuable research linkages.  In order to promote core-funded activities at ISEC, Prof Rao got the support of the Union Ministry of Agriculture to house one of its three agro-economic research units i.e. the Agricultural Development and Rural Transformation (ADRT) at the Institute (the other two are housed at the [[Institute of Economic Growth]], Delhi, and the [[Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad|Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad]]).  The [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare]] has also established the Population Research Centre (PRC) at ISEC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isec.ac.in&lt;/ref&gt; 

ISEC is the biggest research Institute amongst ICSSR sponsored interdisciplinary research institutions. The research and academic activities of the institute are structured under eight centers covering the areas ranging from economics, ecological economics, agricultural economics, population research, sociology, health, education, political science, public administration, decentralization and rural development. The research under the centres is collectively discussed and monitored through statutory bodies.

ISEC has a well qualified faculty of forty five from different areas of social and life sciences. With the help of Faculty’s scholarship and with national and international collaborations, ISEC is on the path of establishing its position as a Centre of excellence in the field of social sciences. Some of the collaborations are with: [[Nordic Centre in India|NORDIC Centre]], [[Netherlands]], [[Maastricht University]], [[World Bank]], [[Asian Development Bank]], [[UNFPA]], [[UNDP]], [[USAID]], [[European Commission]], the Swedish C-Dot, [[DANIDA]] and [[Ford Foundation]]. In the honor of Dr.V K R V Rao ISEC has instituted a visiting chair, presently held by Prof. [[Ashutosh Varshney]], Professor of Political Science at [[Brown University]]. 
ISEC has a strong and unique programme for training social science students for their [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]. The students are taken for the course from an open advertisement and after a rigorous scrutiny of about 12 out of 300 applicants the students are undergo training for one year. ISEC provides fellowships to the students and up till now about 200 students have obtained their PhD in Social Sciences through ISEC. ISEC has the state of art infrastructure that includes one of the best libraries, data bank, digital sources of information, seminar halls, auditorium, students’ hostel, residential accommodation and guest house.

It is rightly recognized that policy-making in India requires a great deal of systematizing and active lobbying of scholarship. Aware of practical difficulties in connecting research to policy, ISEC from the very beginning has established itself as a credible and accountable institution to provide policy feedback to the [[Government of India]] and the [[State governments of India|state governments]]. In addition, ISEC has regularly contributed and assisted central, state and local governments by providing advice on important issues.

==Data bank==

ISEC has set up a [[data bank]] for storing both secondary and primary data collected for several projects. It has also gathered and stored basic [[National Service Scheme|NSS]] and [[Census of India|census data]] and other secondary data from World Bank, [[Reserve Bank of India|RBI]], etc., as well as data on the [[Economy of India|Indian economy]], polity and society and classified them in a user-friendly manner.  Manned by a data bank manager, there are plans to index the data available in the bank for easier use.  All these will be put on the network and the entire work will be taken up in a time bound manner to make it available to ISEC users.

==Infrastructure==

The ISEC campus is located in [[Nagarbhavi]] Village, Bangalore on the south-western outskirts of the city.  Set amidst 16 hectares of verdant green landscapes, it abuts the [[Bangalore University|Bangalore University’s]] Jnanabharati premises. The campus has an academic and administrative complex, student hostels, a guesthouse for visiting scholars, residential facilities for 77 faculty members and staff, four seminar halls, two committee rooms, and a 300-seater auditorium.

==V.K.R.V. Rao Library==
The V.K.R.V. Rao Library at ISEC has a collection of two lakh titles, 400 microfiche copies of periodicals, official and non-official documents and back volumes of professional journals and periodicals. ISEC also subscribes to about 350 professional foreign and Indian journals, and nine newspapers. The V.K.R.V. Rao Library is considered as one of the best reference libraries in social sciences in south India{{by whom|date=February 2018}}, and the World Bank and several other international organisations have recognised it as a depository library.  The collections of valuable books received as bequests from Bharat Ratna Sir [[M. Visvesvaraya|M. Visveswaraya]], Prof. V.K.R.V. Rao and Prof. P.R. Brahmananda are treasured possessions of the library and have added great value to it.{{According to whom|date=February 2018}}  

Using a grant from Government of Karnataka ISEC has started a [[digital library]] and a large number of rare books and reports in social sciences have been digitised.  Additionally, some books published by ISEC students and other ISEC publications have been digitised and all of these are available online to users. ISEC has entered into agreements with Mythic Society, [[Mysore University]] and [[Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics]] to take ahead the process of digitisation.

==Specialization==

ISEC is equipped with the expertise in studying and analyzing the various aspects of Indian economy and [[Indian society|society]]. It has vast experience in analyzing the institutions of local government and in capacitating them through training and research on governance issues. Policy formulation, efficient delivery of services, implementation of government projects and leadership are some of the areas which ISEC has trained Government officials at all levels (both from state and nation) and Ministers. ISEC endeavours to periodically update its research vision keeping in view the emerging challenges in social sciences. 

[[Research]] activities are conducted under the various centres, which also match the thematic research areas and the requirements of the funding agencies. The various centres are: 
* Agricultural Development and Rural Transformation Centre
* Centre for Economic Studies and Policy
* Centre for Decentralisation and Development
* Centre for Human Resource Development
* Centre for Political Institutions
* Governance and Development
* Centre for Ecological Economics and Natural Resources
* Population Research Centre
The larger impact of ISEC has been through dissemination of the results of its research studies.  In the past 38 years of its existence, the Institute has completed studies on wide-ranging topics in social sciences.  The papers and publications have been shared widely with other social science research institutions and are well received by scholars in social sciences and policy makers alike.  This includes 650 applied and policy-related studies on various economic, social, political and administrative issues, 225 books, and over 2,500 technical articles published by the faculty. Of these, over 1100 articles were published in refereed journals in India and abroad, 400 articles in various magazines and about 1,000 articles in various media. ISEC faculty members have made their presence felt in many national and international seminars, conferences and workshops.  Regular contributions by ISEC faculty and students appear in leading newspapers to raise the standard of public debate and influence public opinion on several contemporary issues. 225 working papers and 20 monographs by the faculty have been published.

The '''Jožef Stefan Institute''' ('''IJS''') ({{lang-sl|Institut "Jožef Stefan"}}) is the largest research [[institute]] in [[Slovenia]]. The main research areas are [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[biotechnology]], [[information technologies]], [[physics|reactor physics]], [[energy]] and [[Natural environment|environment]]. At the beginning of the 2013 the institute had 962 employees, 404 of them were [[Ph.D]] [[scientists]].

The mission of the Jožef Stefan Institute is the accumulation and dissemination of knowledge at the frontiers of natural science and technology to the benefit of society at large through the pursuit of education, learning, research, and development of high technology at the highest international levels of excellence.

==History==
The institute was founded by Yugoslav State Security in 1949 for atomic weapons research. Initially, the [[Vinča Nuclear Institute]] in Belgrade was established in 1948, followed by Rudjer Boskovic in Zagreb in 1949 and the Jožef Stefan Institute as an Institute for Physics in the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. It is named after the distinguished 19th-century physicist [[Josef Stefan|Jožef Stefan]], best known for his work on the [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]] of [[Black body|black-body]] radiation.

IJS is today involved in a wide variety of fields of scientific and economic interest. After close to 60 years of scientific achievement, the institute has become part of the image of [[Slovenia]].

Over the last 60 years it has created a number of important institutions, such as the [[University of Nova Gorica]], the Jožef Stefan International Postgraduate School&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mps.si/splet/index.asp?lang=eng|title=The 2013/2014 CALL FOR ENROLMENT to postgraduate study programmes|publisher=Jožef Stefan International Postgraduate School}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ljubljana Technology park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tp-lj.si/|title=Tehnološki Park Ljubljana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4337">'''Macrocognition''' indicates a descriptive level of cognition performed in natural instead of artificial (laboratory) environments. This term is reported to have been coined by Pietro Cacciabue and Erik Hollnagel in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;P.C. Cacciabue and E. Hollnagel, "Simulation of Cognition: Applications," Expertise and Technology: Cognition and Human-Computer Cooperation, J.M. Hoc, P.C. Cacciabue, and E. Hollnagel, eds., Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1995, pp. 55–73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.E. Klein, H.A. Klein, and G. Klein,
"Macrocognition: Linking Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Ergonomics," Proc. 5th Int’l Conf. Human Interactions with Complex Systems, Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2000, pp. 173–177&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is also reported that the term was used in the 1980s in European Cognitive Systems Engineering research. Possibly the earliest reference is the following, although it does not use the exact term "macrocognition":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A macro-theory is a theory which is concerned with the obvious regularities of human experience, rather than with some theoretically defined unit. To refer to another psychological school, it would correspond to a theory at the level of Gestalten. It resembles Newell’s suggestion for a solution that would analyse more complex tasks, although the idea of a macro-theory does not entail an analysis of the mechanistic materialistic kind which is predominant in cognitive psychology. Thus we should have a macro-theory of remembering rather than of memory, to say nothing of short-term memory, proactive inhibition release, or memory scanning. To take another example, we should have a macro-theory of attending, rather than a mini-theory of attention, or micro-theories of limited channel capacities or logarithmic dependencies in disjunctive reaction times. This would ease the dependence on the information processing analogy, but not necessarily lead to an abandonment of the information processing terminology, the Flowchart, or the concept of control structures. The meta-technical sciences can contribute to a psychology of cognition as well as to cognitive psychology. What should be abandoned is rather the tendency to think in elementaristic terms and to increase the plethora of mini-and micro-theories.
...
To conclude, if the psychological study of cognition shall have a future that is not a continued description of human information processing, its theories must be at what we have called the macro-level. This means that they must correspond to the natural units of experience and consider these in relation to the regularities of human experience, rather than as manifestations of hypothetical information processing mechanisms in the brain. A psychology should start at the level of natural units in human experience and try to work upwards towards the level of functions and human action, rather than downwards towards the level of elementary information processes and the structure of the IPS.&lt;ref&gt;Hollnagel, E. (1981). Cognitive psychology: The European and American approaches. (Unpublished manuscript; pdf version available by request to author.)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The use of the term suggests that there is strong evidence in which naturalistic decision-making and the environments in which they occur are navigated in cognitively different ways than artificial or controlled environments.

Macrocognition is distinguished from [[microcognition]] by elements of time-pressure and risk, performance by experts (as opposed to college students or novices), ambiguity of goals and outcomes, and complex and unclear conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4554">{{For|the animated film|The Magic Pipe}}

A '''magic pipe''' is a surreptitious change to a ship's [[Oily Water Separator (marine)|oily water separator]], or other waste-handing equipment, which allows waste liquids to be discharged in contravention of maritime [[pollution]] regulations.&lt;ref name=CLM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clm.com/docs/smi02-2007.pdf|title=Beware of the 'Magic Pipe'|accessdate=2010-12-13|date=2008-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pipe may be improvised, aboard ship, from available hoses and pumps, to discharge untreated waste water directly into the sea. As ships are often required to keep records of waste and its treatment, magic pipe cases often involve falsification of these records too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/government/environmental-regulations/862836-1.html |accessdate=2010-12-13 |title=Magic pipe incident draws huge fine |work=All Business |date=2010-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211101541/http://www.allbusiness.com/government/environmental-regulations/862836-1.html |archivedate=December 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bimco.org/Members/News/2010/2010/06/02_Magic_pipe_cases_continue_in_US.aspx |accessdate=2010-12-13|title="Magic pipe" cases continue in US – so do severe fines and banning of vessels - BIMCO |date=2010-12-13}}{{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, magic pipe cases often attract large fines for shipping lines, and prison sentences for crew.&lt;ref name=CLM/&gt; Cases are often brought to light by [[whistle blower]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/sector/regulation/article171820.ece |accessdate=2010-12-13|title=Lloyd's List - Regulation - Lemissoler magic pipe case collapses |date=2010-12-13}}{{pay}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a 2016 case involving Princess Cruise Lines which resulted in a record US $40 million fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/02/the-40m-magic-pipe-princess-cruises-given-record-fine-for-dumping-oil-at-sea|accessdate=2016-12-04|title=The $40m 'magic pipe': Princess Cruises given record fine for dumping oil at sea|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem is worsened by a lack of facilities in developing countries; some [[Port Reception Facilities|port reception facilities]] do not allow for oily water to be discharged easily and cost effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A corrupt corporate culture|url=http://www.motorship.com/news101/ships-equipment/a-corrupt-corporate-culture|accessdate=29 September 2013|newspaper=The Motorship|date=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pipe is known as magic because it bypasses the ship's oily water separator and goes right overboard.  Therefore it can make untreated bilge water magically disappear.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Magic Pipe: The Mystery of the Illegal Activity Still Continues on Ships|url = http://www.marineinsight.com/misc/maritime-law/magic-pipe-the-mystery-of-the-illegal-activity-still-continues-on-ships/|accessdate = 2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the pipe can be easily disconnected and stored away into a different spot of the ship so state and regulatory officers would not be able to detect its usage.  The use of magic pipes continues to this day, and efforts to improve bilge water treatment to make the use of magic pipes unnecessary also continue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Crew members, engineers, and ship owners can receive huge fines and even imprisonment if they continue to use a magic pipe to pollute the environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, many engineers still use the magic pipe because of lack of shore side assistance with regard to bilge water treatment, lack of training or simple individual disregard of the ocean environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On older OWS systems bypass pipes were fitted with regulatory approval. These approved pipes are no longer fitted on newer vessels. In serious emergencies ship's crews are allowed to discharge untreated bilge water overboard, but need to declare those emergencies in the ship's records and [[oil record book]].

'''Arnott Maxwell Fernie''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|OBE|size=85%}} (25 April 1910{{spaced ndash}}22 May 1999) was a New Zealand [[organist]], teacher and conductor. He was an authority on [[Gregorian chant]], sixteenth century [[polyphony]], organ construction and tonal design.

==Life==
Fernie was born in [[Wellington]] on 25 April 1910 and received his first schooling from the [[Marist Brothers]] in [[Newtown, New Zealand|Newtown]] and later at [[Wellington College (New Zealand)|Wellington College]]. He became a leader in church music while still a young man, taking up the position of choir master and organist at St Joseph's Catholic Church, Wellington.

At the outbreak of [[World War II]], Fernie served with the second [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]] in [[Egypt]] and Europe. At the end of the war he stayed on in England to study at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in [[London]], gaining several prizes.

Fernie returned to Wellington in the early 1950s as the director of music for Catholic Schools in the Archdiocese, a position he held until 1953 when he was called back to London as organist and choir instructor at [[Westminster Cathedral]].

After five acclaimed years of intensive organ playing, music making and teaching, he returned to New Zealand to become the Director of Music at [[St Mary of the Angels, Wellington|St. Mary of the Angels]] where he supervised the building of the new organ constructed to his design. Fernie's development of sixteenth century polyphony at St. Mary of the Angels became a model for [[Roman Catholic Church]] choirs.&lt;ref&gt;John Mansfield Thomson, ''The Oxford history of New Zealand music'', Oxford University Press, USA (16 May 1991), p=104&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years, Fernie schooled choirs, taught piano, organ and singing, and trained celebrated musicians. His notable students included Nicolas Kynaston, [[Ivan Bootham]], Patricia Lawrey, Anthony Jennings, Peter Walls, [[Denis Smalley]], Geoffrey Coker, Roy Tankersley, Christopher Hainsworth and [[Barry Mora]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smoa.org.nz/music/fernie.php St Mary of the Angels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114033709/http://www.smoa.org.nz/music/fernie.php |date=14 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as being a well-known broadcaster and lecturer, he founded and conducted the Schola Polyphonica Choir (specialising in 16th Century polyphony) in 1967. He was Wellington city organist for 27 years and played the [[Wellington Town Hall|Town Hall's]] massive Norman &amp; Beard pipe organ on numerous occasions for civic receptions and supervised its restoration in the 1980s. From 1963 till 1988 he taught a new generation of young organists at [[Victoria University of Wellington]], helping to bring about an organ renaissance in New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In 1978, Fernie was commissioned to arrange new music for the New Zealand national anthem ''[[God Defend New Zealand]]'', making it easier for the general public to sing.&lt;ref&gt;Francesca Di Piazza, ''New Zealand In Pictures'', Lerner Publications (30 September 2005), p=69&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued as Director of Music at St Mary's until his death on 22 May 1999.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maxwellfernietrust.com/index.html "One man's legacy…"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714052345/http://www.maxwellfernietrust.com/index.html |date=14 July 2011 }}, The Maxwell Fernie Trust, retrieved 08-12-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Fernie was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1974 for his services to music. He received the [[Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice]] from the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in 1989.

==The Maxwell Fernie Organ==
The organ at St Mary of the Angels was named after its designer and organist of 40 years, Maxwell Fernie in 2006.  The organ was originally built in 1958 by George Croft and Son Limited from [[Auckland]] to the tonal design and pipe-scaling of Maxwell Fernie, who also supervised the voicing of the pipes and the construction of the instrument.

According to Maxwell Fernie: "The organ possesses some unique features. The [[Flue pipe|Diapason]] choruses on both Swell and Great are of “constant scale” and wholly of Schultze-type voicing and scale with generous treble measurements. The swell-reed chorus is complete and independent, voiced in keeping with the large Gothic-type church which houses the three-manual and pedal instrument in the west gallery. The positive section contains probably the first examples of solo flute-mutations in New Zealand and the whole instrument is flexible in the extreme owing to a generous number of inter-manual and pedal couplers. Tonally it might be said that the organ, with mainly pipes from England and parts from Germany, the [[Netherlands]] and United States has a Continental flavour…acknowledging all schools of composition of the various periods and nationalities. It amply fulfils its prime function as a church organ, and various famous recitalists have praised its ability to enable them to ‘make music’, without tonal restrictions in their recitals.”

It is the only organ of its type in New Zealand. It comprises three manuals and pedals with some sixty-five speaking stops and a great many coupling options that give the instrument a unique flexibility to interchange the stops or sounds available between the manuals.

In 1984 the instrument was extensively rebuilt and extended by the [[South Island Organ Company]] of Timaru, once again to the specifications designed by Maxwell Fernie and under his careful supervision.

During the period following the 1984 rebuild, the organ suffered quite serious water and some rodent damage. This particularly affected the right-hand side of the instrument, the section containing parts of the Great, Positive and Pedal organ. Damage to the wind chests, some of the wooden pipes and to the electro-mechanical working of the organ affected the instrument to the extent that several ranks of pipes no longer functioned.

An appeal launched in December 2006 raised funds sufficient to restore the organ to its 1958 performance condition and also, to replace the original electrical circuitry with a modern computerised system. The appeal was coordinated by the Friends of St. Mary of the Angels Charitable Trust and involved the wider Wellington community. The organ was decommissioned by the South Island Organ Company following [[Easter]] 2006. The fully restored instrument was welcomed back at a celebration on 29 April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smoa.org.nz/music/fernie.php St. Mary of the Angels: The Maxwell Fernie Organ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114033709/http://www.smoa.org.nz/music/fernie.php |date=14 January 2012 }}, retrieved 08-12-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''millennium''' (plural '''millennia''' or '''millenniums''') is a period equal to [[1000 (number)|1000]] [[year]]s,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/millennium millennium]", ''Oxford Dictionaries'' (Oxford University Press, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; also called kiloyears. It derives from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|mille}}'', thousand, and ''{{lang|la|annus}}'', year. It is often, but not always, related to a particular [[calendar|dating system]].

Sometimes, it is used specifically for periods of a thousand years that begin at the starting point (initial reference point) of the calendar in consideration (typically the year "1"), or in later years that are whole number multiples of a thousand years after it. The term can also refer to an interval of time beginning on any date. Frequently in the latter case (and sometimes also in the former) it may have religious or theological implications (see [[millenarianism]]).

==Counting years==
There are two methods of counting years: current years (the count begins at the epoch) and elapsed years (the count is of completed years since the epoch).

The original method of counting years was [[ordinal number|ordinal]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} whether ''1st year [[AD]]'' or [[regnal year|regnal]] ''10th year of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]''. This ordinal numbering is still used in the names of the millennia and centuries, for example the ''1st millennium'' or the ''10th century'', and sometimes in the names of decades, e.g., ''1st decade of the 11th century''.

The main issues arise from the ''content'' of the various year ranges. Similar issues affect the ''contents'' of centuries. Decades are not subject to ambiguity, as they are named according to their leading numbers: the decade called the 1990s by its naming does not include 2000.

Those following ordinal year names naturally choose
* 2001–2100 (inclusive) as the current century
* 2001–3000 (inclusive) as the current millennium
Those who are influenced by the leading digit equally naturally choose
* 2000–2099 (inclusive) as the current century
* 2000–2999 (inclusive) as the current millennium

==Debate over millennium celebrations==
There are two viewpoints about how millennia should be thought of in practice. One viewpoint relies on the formal operation of the calendar, while the other appeals to [[Popular culture|popular culture]]. [[Stephen Jay Gould]] argued that the choice is arbitrary, and since the question revolves around rules made by people, rather than a natural phenomenon that is subject to experimental measurement, the matter cannot be resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Stephen Jay, ''Questioning the Millennium'' (New York: Harmony Books, 1997), part 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ISO 8601]], employed in [[ISO 8601 usage|a number of contexts]], uses the [[Astronomical year numbering|astronomical calendar]], in which year counting starts at 0. Thus, when using this calendar, the millennium starts at x000 and ends at x999. There was a popular debate leading up to the [[Millennium celebrations|celebrations of the year 2000]] as to whether the beginning of that year should be understood (and celebrated) as the beginning of a new millennium. Historically, there has been debate around the turn of previous decades, centuries, and millennia.

The issue is tied to the convention of using [[ordinal number]]s to count millennia (as in "the third millennium"), as opposed to "the two thousands", which is unambiguous as it does not depend on which year counting starts. The first convention is common in English speaking countries, but the latter is favored in for example Sweden (''tvåtusentalet'', which translates literally as the ''two thousands period'').

===Viewpoint 1: X001–Y000===
Those holding that the arrival of the new millennium should be celebrated in the transition from 2000 to 2001 (i.e., December 31, 2000 to January 1, 2001), argued that because the Gregorian calendar has no year zero, the millennia should be counted from 1 AD. Thus the first period of one thousand complete years runs from the beginning of 1 AD to the end of 1000 AD, and the beginning of the second millennium took place at the beginning of 1001.

[[Arthur C. Clarke]] gave this [[analogy]] (from a statement received by [[Reuters]]): "If the scale on your grocer's weighing machine began at 1 instead of 0, would you be happy when he claimed he'd sold you 10 kg of tea?" This statement illustrates the common confusion about the calendar.

If one counts from the beginning of AD 1 to the ending of AD 1000, one would have counted 1000&amp;nbsp;years. The next 1000&amp;nbsp;years (millennium) would begin on the first day of 1001. So the calendar has not 'cheated' anyone out of a year. Clarke made reference to this viewpoint in his book ''[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]'' referring to the Millennium Celebrations on December 31, 2000. In other words, the argument is based on the fact that the last year of the first two thousand years in the Gregorian calendar was 2000, not 1999.

===Viewpoint 2: X000–X999===
The "year 2000" has also been a popular phrase referring to an often [[utopia]]n future, or a year when stories in such a future were set, adding to its cultural significance. There was also media and public interest in the [[Y2K bug]]. People liked to compared their [[Odometer|odometer]] as a reason to celebrate the new millennium which goes from 1999 to 2000. Thus, the populist argument was that the new millennium should begin when the zeroes "rolled over" to 2000, i.e., the day after December 31, 1999. People&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermetic.ch/cal_stud/newmill.htm "When Does the New Millennium Begin?"] January 1, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; felt that the change of the hundreds digit in the year number, and the zeros rolling over, created a sense that a new century had begun.

This is similar to the common demarcation of decades by their most significant digits, e.g., naming the period 1980 to 1989 as the 1980s or "the eighties". Similarly, it would be valid to celebrate the year 2000 as a cultural event in its own right, and name the period 2000 to 2999 would be "the 2000s". In other words, the time period between 1 and 999 (999 years only) would be called the "0s" and the period between 1000 and 1999 would be the "1000s".

===Popular approach===
The popular&lt;ref name=AP&gt;Associated Press, [http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/01/news/mn-7177 "Y2K It Wasn't, but It Was a Party"], ''Los Angeles Times'', January 1, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; approach was to treat the end of 1999 as the end of a millennium and to hold millennium celebrations at midnight between December 31, 1999 and January 1, 2000, as per viewpoint 2. The cultural and psychological significance of the events listed above combined to cause celebrations to be observed one year earlier than the formal Gregorian date.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; This does not establish that insistence on the formal Gregorian date is "incorrect", though some view it as pedantic.

Some event organisers hedged their bets by calling their 1999 celebrations things like "Click" referring to the [[odometer]]-like rolling over of the nines to zeros. A second approach was to adopt two different views on the millennium problem and celebrate the new millennium twice.

[[Stephen Jay Gould]], in his essay ''Dousing Diminutive Dennis' Debate (or DDDD = 2000)'' (''[[Dinosaur in a Haystack]]''), discussed the "high" versus "pop" culture interpretation of the transition. Gould noted that the high culture, strict construction had been the dominant viewpoint at the 20th century's beginning, but that the pop culture viewpoint dominated at its end. Gould also included comments on adjustments to the calendar, such as those by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] (the eponymous "Diminutive Dennis") and the timing of celebrations over different transitional periods. Further of his essays on this topic are collected in ''Questioning the Millennium: A Rationalist's Guide to a Precisely Arbitrary Countdown''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5517">'''Modular constructivism''' is a style of [[sculpture]] that emerged in the 1950s and 1960s and was associated especially with [[Erwin Hauer]] and [[Norman Carlberg]]. It is based on carefully structured modules which allow for intricate and in some cases infinite patterns of repetition, sometimes used to create limitless, basically planar, screen-like formations, and sometimes employed to make more multidimensional structures. Designing these structures involves intensive study of the combinatorial possibilities of sometimes quite curvilinear and fluidly shaped modules, creating a seamless, quasi-organic unity that can be either rounded and self-enclosed, or open and potentially infinite. The latter designs have proved useful and attractive for use in eye-catching architectural walls and screens, often featuring complex patterns of undulating, tissue-like webbing, with apertures which transmit and filter light, while generating delicate patterns of shadow.

Writing in ''Architecture Week'' (August 4, 2004), Hauer explains that "Continuity and potential infinity have been at the very center of my sculpture from early on." [http://www.architectureweek.com/2004/0804/culture_2-2.html] Hauer made an extensive study of [[biomorphism|biomorphic]] form, especially what he calls "saddle surfaces," which combine convex and concave curvature and thus allow for smooth self-combination, sometimes in multiple dimensions. Another inspiration is the sculpture of [[Henry Moore]], with its fluid curves and porosity.

Hauer's enthusiasm caught the imagination of his colleague at [[Yale]], [[Norman Carlberg]]. Both were devoted students of the arch-formalist [[Josef Albers]]. Indeed, from the beginning, there was in this modular approach to sculpture an implicit [[formalism (art)|formalism]] and even [[minimalism]] which held itself aloof from some of the other artistic trends of the time, such as the [[pop art]] and [[post-modernism]] that were just beginning to emerge. As Carlberg recalls, within his artistic circle "you analysed, you looked at something, but you looked at it formally just for what it was and the message was almost always out of it."

Its decimal expansion begins with {{gaps|1.32471|79572|44746|02596|09088|54…}}.&lt;ref&gt;Sequence {{OEIS2C|id=A060006}} in the [[OEIS]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
===Recurrences===
The powers of the plastic number {{math|''A''(''n'') {{=}} ''ρ''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} satisfy the third-order linear recurrence relation {{math|''A''(''n'') {{=}} ''A''(''n'' − 2) + ''A''(''n'' − 3)}} for&amp;nbsp;{{math|''n'' &gt; 2}}. Hence it is the limiting ratio of successive terms of any (non-zero) integer sequence satisfying this recurrence such as the [[Padovan sequence|Cordonnier numbers]] (better known as the Padovan sequence) the [[Perrin number]]s and the [[Van der Laan numbers]], and bears relationships to these sequences akin to the relationships of the [[golden ratio]] to the second-order [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci]] and [[Lucas number|Lucas]] numbers, akin to the relationships between the [[silver ratio]] and the [[Pell number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;;{{harvtxt|Shannon|Anderson|Horadam|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plastic number satisfies the [[nested radical]] recurrence:&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=PlasticConstant|title=Plastic Constant|author=Piezas, Tito III; van Lamoen, Floor; and Weisstein, Eric W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \sqrt[3]{1 + \sqrt[3]{1 + \sqrt[3]{1 + \cdots}}} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

===Number theory===
Because the plastic number has the [[Minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]] {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − ''x'' − 1 {{=}} 0,}} it is also a solution of the polynomial equation {{math|''p''(''x'') {{=}} 0}} for every polynomial {{math|''p''}} that is a multiple of {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − ''x'' − 1,}} but not for any other polynomials with integer coefficients. Since the [[discriminant]] of its minimal polynomial is −23, its [[splitting field]] over rationals is {{math|ℚ({{sqrt|−23}}, ''ρ''}}). This field is also a [[Hilbert class field]] of {{math|ℚ({{sqrt|−23}})}}.

The plastic number is the smallest [[Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number]]. Its [[algebraic conjugate]]s are
:&lt;math&gt;\left(-\tfrac12\pm\tfrac{\sqrt3}2i\right)\sqrt[3]{\tfrac{1}{2}+\tfrac{1}{6}\sqrt{\tfrac{23}{3}}}+\left(-\tfrac12\mp\tfrac{\sqrt3}2i\right)\sqrt[3]{\tfrac{1}{2}-\tfrac{1}{6}\sqrt{\tfrac{23}{3}}}\approx -0.662359 \pm 0.56228i ,&lt;/math&gt;
of [[absolute value]]&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;0.868837 {{OEIS|A191909}}. This value is also {{math|{{sfrac|1|{{sqrt|''ρ''}}}}}} because the product of the three roots of the minimal polynomial is 1.

===Trigonometry===
The plastic number can be written using the [[hyperbolic cosine]] ({{math|cosh}}) and its inverse:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \tfrac{1}{c} \cosh\left(\tfrac{1}{3} \cosh^{-1} (3 c)\right), \qquad
c = \cos\left(\tfrac{2 \pi}{12}\right) = \sin\left(\tfrac{2 \pi}{6}\right) = \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \, .&lt;/math&gt;
(See [[Cubic function#Trigonometric (and hyperbolic) method]].)

=== Name ===

Dutch architect &amp; [[Benedictine monk]] Dom [[Hans van der Laan]] gave the name ''plastic number'' (''het plastische getal'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) to this number in 1928. In 1924, four years prior to van der Laan's christening of the number's name, French engineer [[Gérard Cordonnier]] had already discovered the number and referred to it as ''the radiant number'' (''le nombre radiant'' in [[French language|French]]). Unlike the names of the [[golden ratio]] and [[silver ratio]], the word plastic was not intended by van der Laan to refer to a specific substance, but rather in its adjectival sense, meaning something that can be given a three-dimensional shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Padovan|2002}}; {{harvtxt|Shannon|Anderson|Horadam|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, according to Padovan, is because the characteristic ratios of the number, {{sfrac|3|4}} and {{sfrac|1|7}}, relate to the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another. Van der Laan designed the 1967 [[St. Benedictusberg Abbey]] church to these plastic number proportions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Padovan|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plastic number is also sometimes called the '''silver number''', a name given to it by [[Midhat J. Gazalé]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40298400|title=Gnomon: From Pharaohs to Fractals|last=Gazalé|first=Midhat J.|date=April 19, 1999|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691005140|location=Princeton, N.J.|pages=135–150|chapter=Chapter VII: The Silver Number|oclc=40298400|author-link=Midhat J.

[[Donald E. Knuth]] has suggested referring to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\rho^2&lt;/math&gt; as "High Phi", along with suggesting a special typographic mark for it.{{Citation needed|reason=Also in Gardner's Workout, Chapter 16, pp. 121–128, but better to cite the 1994 Quantum version at this point in the text, which lacks the postscript from Gardner's book.|date=November 2017}}

'''Principles of intelligent urbanism''' ('''PIU''') is a theory of [[urban planning]] composed of a set of ten axioms intended to guide the formulation of city plans and urban designs. They are intended to reconcile and integrate diverse urban planning and management concerns. These axioms include [[Environmentalism|environmental]] [[sustainability]], [[heritage conservation]], [[appropriate technology]], infrastructure-efficiency, [[placemaking]], [[social access]], [[transit-oriented development]],  [[regional integration]], [[human scale]], and institutional integrity. The term was coined by Prof. [[Christopher Charles Benninger]].

The '''PIU''' evolved from the city planning guidelines formulated by the [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne|''International Congress of Modern Architecture'' (CIAM)]], the urban design approaches developed at Harvard's pioneering Urban Design Department under the leadership of [[Josep Lluis Sert]], and the concerns enunciated by [[Team Ten]].  It is most prominently seen in plans prepared by [[Christopher Charles Benninger]] and his numerous colleagues in the Asian context (Benninger 2001). They form the elements of the planning curriculum at the School of Planning, [[Ahmedabad]], which Benninger founded in 1971.  They were the basis for the new capital plan for [[Thimphu]], [[Bhutan]].&lt;ref name=Thimphu&gt;[http://www.dudh.gov.bt/Thimphustructural/Index.html Thimphu Structural Plan 2002-2027] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623013525/http://www.dudh.gov.bt/Thimphustructural/Index.html |date=2010-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Axioms==
===Principle one: a balance with nature===
According to proponents of intelligent urbanism, balance with nature emphasizes the distinction between utilizing resources and exploiting them.  It focuses on the thresholds beyond which [[deforestation]], [[soil erosion]], [[aquifer]] depletion, [[silting|siltation]] and flooding reinforce one another in urban development, saving or destroying life support systems.  The principle promotes environmental assessments to identify fragile zones, threatened [[ecosystems]] and habitats that can be enhanced through conservation, density control, [[land use planning]] and [[Urban open space|open space]] design (McCarg: 1975). This principle promotes life cycle building energy consumption and pollutant emission analysis.&lt;ref&gt;McHarg I. (1975): Design with Nature, Wiley, John and Sons, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle states there is a level of human habitation intensity wherein the resources that are consumed will be replaced through the replenishing natural cycles of the seasons, creating environmental equilibrium.  Embedded in the principle is  contention that so long as nature can resurge each year; so long as the biomass can survive within its own [[eco-system]]; so long as the breeding grounds of fauna and avifauna are safe; so long as there is no erosion and the biomass is maintained, nature is only being utilized.

Underlying this principle is the supposition that there is a fragile line that is crossed when the [[fauna]], which cross-fertilizes the [[flora]], which sustains the soil, which supports the hillsides, is no longer there. Erosion, siltation of drainage networks and flooding result. After a point of no return, utilization of [[natural resources]] will outpace the natural ability of the [[Ecosystem|eco-system]] to replenish itself.  From there on degradation accelerates and amplifies.  [[Deforestation]], [[desertification]], [[erosion]], floods, fires and landslides all increase.

The principle states that blatant "acts against nature" include cutting of hillside trees, [[quarry]]ing on slopes, dumping [[sewage]] and [[industrial waste]] into the natural [[drainage basin|drainage system]], paving and plinthing excessively, and construction on steep slopes.   This [[urban theory]] proposes that the urban ecological balance can be maintained when fragile areas are reserved, conservation of eco-systems is pursued, and low intensity habitation precincts are thoughtfully identified.  Thus, the principles operate within the balance of nature, with a goal of protecting and conserving those elements of the ecology that nurture the environment.  Therefore, the first principle of intelligent urbanism is that urbanization be in balance with nature.

===Principle two: a balance with tradition===
Balance with tradition is intended to integrate plan interventions with existing cultural assets, respecting traditional practices and precedents of style (Spreiregen: 1965). This urban planning principle demands respect for the [[cultural heritage]] of a place.  It seeks out traditional wisdom in the layout of human settlements, in the order of building plans, in the precedents of style, in the symbols and signs that transfer meanings through decoration and motifs.  This principle respects the order engendered into building systems through years of adaptation to climate, to social circumstances, to available materials and to technology.  It promotes [[architectural styles]] and motifs designed to communicate cultural values.

This principle calls for orienting attention toward historic monuments and heritage structures, leaving space at the ends of visual axis to “frame" existing views and vistas. Natural views and vistas demand respect, assuring that buildings do not block major sight lines toward visual assets.

Embedded in the principle is the concern for unique cultural and societal iconography of regions, their signs and symbols. Their incorporation into the spatial order of urban settings is promoted.  Adherents promote the orientation and structuring of urban plans using local knowledge and meaning systems, expressed through art, urban space and architecture.

Planning decisions must operate within the balance of tradition, aggressively protecting, promoting and conserving generic components and elements of the urban pattern.

===Principle three: appropriate technology===
[[Appropriate technology]] emphasizes the employment of [[building materials]], construction techniques, infrastructural systems and [[project management]] which are consistent with local contexts (situation, setting or circumstances)[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/contexts]. People's capacities, geo-climatic conditions, locally available resources, and suitable [[investment|capital investments]] all temper technology. Where there are abundant craftspeople, labour-intensive methods are appropriate. Where there is surplus savings, capital intensive methods are appropriate. For every problem there is a range of potential technologies, which can be applied, and an appropriate fit between technology and other resources must be established. Proponents argue that accountability and transparency are enhanced by overlaying the physical spread of urban utilities and services upon electoral constituencies, such that people’s representatives are interlinked with the urban technical systems needed for a [[civil society]]. This principle is in sync with "small is beautiful" concepts and with the use of local resources.

===Principle four: conviviality===
The fourth principle  sponsors [[social interaction]] through public domains, in a hierarchy of places, devised for personal solace, companionship, romance, domesticity, "neighborliness," community and civic life (Jacobs:1993). According to proponents of intelligent urbanism, vibrant societies are interactive, socially engaging and offer their members numerous opportunities for gathering and meeting one another.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs Jane (1993): [[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]], [[Random House]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  The PIU maintain that this can be achieved through design and that society operates within hierarchies of [[social relation]]s which are space specific.  The hierarchies can be conceptualized as a system of social tiers, with each tier having a corresponding physical place in the settlement structure.

====A place for the individual====
A goal of intelligent urbanism is to create places of solitude. These may be in urban forests, along urban hills, beside quiet streams, in public gardens and in parks where one can escape to meditate and contemplate.  According to proponents, these are the quiet places wherein the individual consciousness dialogues with the rational mind.  Idle and random thought sorts out complexities of modern life and allows the obvious to emerge.  It is in these natural settings that the wandering mind finds its measure and its balance. Using ceremonial gates, directional walls and other “silent devices" these spaces are denoted and divined.  Places of the individual cultivate introspection.  These spaces may also be the forecourts and interior courtyards of public buildings, or even the thoughtful reading rooms of libraries. Meditation focuses one's thought.  Intelligent urbanism creates a domain for the individual to mature through self-analysis and [[self-realization]].

====A place for friendship====
The axiom insists that in city plans there must be spaces for “beautiful, intimate [[friendship]]" where unfettered dialogue can happen.  This principle insists that such places will not exist naturally in a modern urban fabric.  They must be a part of the conscientious design of the urban core, of the urban hubs, of urban villages and of neighborhoods, where people can meet with friends and talk out life’s issues, sorrows, joys and dilemmas.  This second tier is important for the emotional life of the populace.  It sponsors strong [[mental health]] within the people, creating places where friendship can unfold and grow.

====A place for householders====
There must be spaces for householders, which may be in the form of dwellings for families, or homes for intimate companions, and where young workmates can form a common kitchen.  Whatever their compositions, there must be a unique domain for [[Group (sociology)|social groups]], familiar or biological, which have organized themselves into households.  These domestic precincts are where families live and carry out their day-to-day functions of life.  This third tier of conviviality is where the individual socializes into a personality.

Housing clusters planned according to this axiom create a variety of household possibilities, which respond to a range of household structures and situations.  It recognizes that households transform through the years, requiring a variety of dwellings types that respond to a complex matrix of needs and abilities, which are provided for in city plans.

====A place for the neighborhood====
Smaller household domains must cluster into a higher social domain, the neighborhood social group.
Good city planning practice sponsors, through design, such units of social space.  It is in this fourth tier of social life that public conduct takes on new dimensions and groups learn to live peacefully among one another.  It is through neighborhoods that the “social contract" amongst diverse households and individuals is sponsored.  This [[social contract]] is the rational basis for social relations and negotiations within larger social groups. Within neighborhoods basic amenities like creches, early learning centers, preventive health care and rudimentary infrastructure are maintained by the community.

====A place for communities====
The next social tier, or hierarchy, is the community.  Historically, communities were tribes who shared [[Mores|social mores]] and cultural behavioral patterns.  In contemporary urban settings communities are formed of diverse people.  But these are people who share the common need to negotiate and manage their spatial settings. In plans created through the principles of intelligent urbanism these are called urban villages.  Like a rural village, social bonds are found in the [[community management]] of security, common resources and social space. Urban villages will have defined social spaces, services and amenities that need to be managed by the community.  According to proponents of intelligent urbanism these urban villages optimally become the administrative wards, and therefore the constituencies, of the elected members of municipal bodies.  Though there are no physical barriers to these communities, they have their unique spatial social domain.  Intelligent urbanism calls for the creation of dense, walkable zones in which the inhabitants recognize each other’s faces, share common facilities and resources, and often see each other at the village centre. This fifth tier of social space is where one needs initiative to join into various activities.  It is intended to promote initiative and constructive community participation.  There are opportunities for one to be involved in the management of services, and amenities and to meet new people. They accommodate primary education and recreation areas. Good planning practice promotes the creation of community places, where community-based organizations can manage common resources and resolve common problems.

====A place for the city domain====
The principles of intelligent urbanism call for city level domains.  These can be plazas, parks, stadia, transport hubs, promenades, "passages" or gallerias.  These are social spaces where everyone can go.  In many cities one has to pay an entrance fee to access “public spaces" like malls and museums.  Unlike the lower tiers of the [[social hierarchy]], this tier is not defined by any biological, familiar, [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] or exclusive characteristic.  One may find people from all continents, from nearby districts and provinces and from all parts of the city in such places. By nature these are accessible and open spaces, with no physical, social or economic barriers. According to this principle it is the rules of human conduct that order this domain’s behavior.  It is civility, or civilization, which protects and energizes such spaces.  At the lower tiers, one meets people through introductions, through family ties, and through neighborhood circumstances.

These domains would include all freely accessible large spaces. These are places where outdoor exhibits are held, sports matches take place, vegetables are sold and goods are on display. These are places where visitors to the city meander amongst the locals. Such places may stay the same, but the people are always changing.  Most significant, these city scale public domains foster public interaction; they sponsor unspoken ground rules for unknown people to meet and to interact.  They nurture civic understanding of the strength of diversity, variety, a range of cultural groups and ethnic mixes. It is this higher tier of social space which defines truly urbane environments.

Every [[Social structure|social system]] has its own hierarchy of social relations and interactions. Intelligent urbanism sees cyberspace as a macro tier of conviviality, but does not discount physical places in forging relationships due to the Internet. These are reflected through a system of ‘places’ that respond to them.  Good urban planning practice promotes the planning and design of such ‘places’ as elemental components of the [[urban structure]].

===Principle five: efficiency===
The principle of efficiency promotes a balance between the consumption of resources such as energy, time and fiscal resources, with planned achievements in comfort, safety, security, access, tenure, productivity and hygiene.  It encourages optimum sharing of public land, roads, facilities, services and infrastructural networks, reducing per household costs, while increasing affordability, productivity, access and civic viability.

Intelligent urbanism promotes a balance between performance and consumption.  Intelligent urbanism promotes efficiency in carrying out functions in a [[Cost-effectiveness|cost effective]] manner. It assesses the performance of various systems required by the public and the consumption of energy, funds, administrative time and the maintenance efforts required to perform these functions.

A major concern of this principle is transport.  While recognizing the convenience of personal vehicles, it attempts to place costs (such as [[Fuel efficiency in transportation|energy consumption]], large paved areas, parking, accidents, negative [[balance of trade]], pollution and related morbidity) on the users of private vehicles.

Good city planning practice promotes alternative modes of transport, as opposed to a dependence on personal vehicles.  It promotes affordable [[public transport]].  It promotes medium to high-density [[residential development]] along with complementary social amenities, convenience shopping, recreation and [[public services]] in compact, walkable mixed-use settlements.  These compact communities have shorter pipe lengths, wire lengths, cable lengths and road lengths per capita.  More people share gardens, shops and transit stops.&lt;ref&gt;Urban Land Institute (1998): Smart Growth, [[Urban Land Institute]], Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

These compact urban nodes are spaced along regional urban transport corridors that integrate the region’s urban nodes, through public transport, into a rational system of growth.  Good planning practice promotes clean, comfortable, safe and speedy, public transport, which operates at dependable intervals along major origin and destination paths.  Such a system is cheaper, safer, less polluting and consumes less energy.

The same principle applies to [[public infrastructure]], social facilities and public services.  Compact, high-density communities result in more efficient urban systems, delivering services at less cost per unit to each citizen.

There is an appropriate balance to be found somewhere on the line between wasteful low-density individual systems and over-capitalized mega systems.  Individual [[septic tank]]s and water bores servicing individual households in low-density fragmented layouts, allow the use of filtered [[greywater]] for free [[irrigation]] of gardens, but, if not maintained, can cause a local pollution of subterranean [[aquifer]] systems. The bores can dramatically lower [[Groundwater|ground water]] levels especially during droughts. The vantage of septic tanks an bores is to be managed by the very users, at no cost for the community.
Alternatively, large-scale, citywide sewerage systems and regional [[water supply]] systems are capital intensive and prone to management and maintenance dysfunction, if not corruption or extortion by private companies.  Operating costs, [[user fees]] and cost recovery expenses are high.   There is a balance wherein medium-scale systems, covering compact communities, utilize modern technology, without the pitfalls of large-scale infrastructure systems.  This principle of urbanism promotes the middle path with regard to public infrastructure, facilities, services and amenities.

When these appropriate facilities and service systems overlap electoral constituencies, the “imagery" between user performance in the form of payments for services, systems dependability through managed delivery, and official response through effective representation, should all become obvious and transparent.

Good city planning practices promote compact settlements along dense urban corridors, and within populated networks, such that the numbers of users who share costs are adequate to support effective and efficient infrastructure systems. Intelligent urbanism is intended to foster movement on foot, linking pedestrian movement with public transport systems at strategic nodes and hubs.  Medium-scale infrastructural systems, whose catchment areas overlap political constituencies and administrative jurisdictions, result in transparent governance and accountable urban management.

===Principle six: human scale===
Intelligent urbanism encourages ground level, pedestrian oriented urban patterns, based on anthropometric dimensions.  Walkable, mixed use urban villages are encouraged over single-function blocks, linked by motor ways, and surrounded by [[parking lot]]s.

An abiding axiom of urban planning, [[urban design]] and city planning has been the promotion of people friendly places, pedestrian walkways and public domains where people can meet freely.  These can be parks, gardens, glass-covered gallerias, arcades, courtyards, street side cafes, river- and hill-side stroll ways, and a variety of semi-covered spaces.

Intelligent urbanism promotes the scale of the pedestrian moving on the pathway, as opposed to the scale of the automobile on the expressway.  Intelligent urbanism promotes the ground plan of imaginable precincts, as opposed to the imagery of façades and the monumentality of the section.  It promotes the personal visibility of places moving on foot at eye level.

Intelligent urbanism advocates removing artificial barrier and promotes face-to-face contact.  Proponents argue that the automobile, [[Single-use zoning|single use zoning]] and the construction of public structures in isolated compounds, all deteriorate [[Human condition|the human condition]] and the human scale of the city.

According to PIU proponents, the trend towards [[urban sprawl]] can be overcome by developing pedestrian circulation networks along streets and open spaces that link local destinations.  Shops, amenities, [[day care]], vegetable markets and basic social services should be clustered around public transport stops, and at a walkable distance from work places, public institutions, high and medium density residential areas.  Public spaces should be integrated into residential, work, entertainment and commercial areas.  Social activities and public buildings should orient onto public open spaces.  These should be the interchange sites for people on the move, where they can also revert into the realm of “slowness," of community life and of human interaction.

Human scale can be achieved through building masses that “step down" to human scale open spaces; by using arcades and pavilions as buffers to large masses; by intermixing open spaces and built masses sensitively; by using [[anthropometric]] proportions and [[natural material]]s.  Traditional building precedents often carry within them a human scale language, from which a contemporary fabric of build may evolve.

The focus of intelligent urbanism is the ground plane, pedestrian movement and interaction along movement channels, stems, at crossing nodes, at interactive hubs and within vibrant urban cores.  The PIU holds many values in common with [[Transit-oriented development|Transit Oriented Development]], but the PIU goal is not merely to replace the automobile, nor to balance it.  These are mundane requirements of planning, which the PIU assumes are found in every design and urban configuration. The PIU goal is to enrich the human condition and to enhance the realm of human possibilities.

Intelligent urbanism conceives of urbanity as a process of facilitating [[human behavior]] toward more tolerant, more peaceful, more accommodating and more sensitive modalities of interaction and [[conflict resolution]].  Intelligent urbanism recognizes that ‘urbanity’ emerges where people mix and interact on a face-to-face basis, on the ground, at high densities and amongst diverse social and economic groups. Intelligent urbanism nurtures ‘urbanity’ through designs and plans that foster human scale interaction.

===Principle seven: opportunity matrix===
The PIU envisions the city as a vehicle for personal, social, and [economic development], through access to a range of organizations, services, facilities and information providing a variety of opportunities for enhanced employment, economic engagement, education, and recreation. This principle aims to increase access to shelter, health care and human resources development. It aims to increase safety and hygienic conditions. The city is a place of economic opportunity. This is generally said with regard to urban annual net product, enriched urban economic base, sustained employment generation and urban balance of trade.  More significantly this is true for the individuals who settle in cities.  Moreover, cities are places where individuals can increase their knowledge, skills and sensitivities.  Cities provide access to [[health care]] and [[preventive medicine]].  They provide a great umbrella of services under which the individual can leave aside the struggle for survival, and get on with the finer things of life.&lt;ref&gt;Sen A. (2000): Development as Freedom: Knopf, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The PIU sees cities as catalysts for personal definition and self-discovery. In cities people get inspired, build a drive to achieve, discover aspects of their personalities, skills and intellectual curiosity which they use to craft their identity.

The city provides a range of services and facilities, whose realization in villages are the all-consuming struggle of rural inhabitants.  Potable water; sewerage management; energy for cooking, heat and lighting are all piped and wired in; [[Waste management|solid waste disposal]] and [[Stormwater|storm water]] drainage are taken for granted.  The city offers access through roads, public transit, telephones and the Internet.  The peace and security provided by effective policing systems, and the courts of law, are just assumed to be there in the city.  Then there are the schools, the recreation facilities, the health services and a myriad of professional services offered in the city market place.

Intelligent urbanism views the city as an opportunity system.  Yet these opportunities are not equally distributed.  Security, health care, education, shelter, hygiene, and most of all employment, are not equally accessible.  Proponents of intelligent urbanism see the city as playing an equalizing role allowing citizens to grow according to their own essential capabilities and efforts.  If the city is an institution, which generates opportunities, intelligent urbanism promotes the concept of equal access to opportunities within the urban system.

Intelligent urbanism promotes a guaranteed access to education, health care, police protection, and justice before the law, potable water, and a range of basic services.  Perhaps this principle, more than any other, distinguishes intelligent urbanism from other elitist, efficiency oriented urban charters and regimes.

Intelligent urbanism does not say every household will stay in an equivalent house, or travel in the same vehicle, or consume the same amount of electricity.

Intelligent urbanism recognizes the existence of poverty, of ignorance, of ill health, of malnutrition, of low skills, of gender bias and ignorance of the urban system itself.  Intelligent urbanism is courageous in confronting these forms of inequality, and backlogs in social and economic development.  Intelligent urbanism sees an urban plan, not only as a physical plan, but also as a social plan and as an economic plan.

The ramifications of this understanding are that the people living in [[smart city|intelligent cities]] should not experience urban development in “standard doses".   In short, people may be born equal or unequal, but they grow inequitably.  An important role of the city is to provide a variety of paths and channels for each individual to set right their own future, against the inequity of their past, or the special challenges they face.  According to proponents of this principle this is the most salient aspect of a [[free society]]; than even [[Suffrage|voting rights]] access to opportunity is the essence of self-liberation and human development (Sen:2000).

According to proponents of intelligent urbanism, there will be a variety of problems faced by urbanites and they need a variety of opportunity channels for resolution.  If there are ten problem areas where people are facing stresses, like economic engagement, health, shelter, food, education, recreation, transport, etc., there must be a variety of opportunities through which individuals and households can resolve each of these stresses.  There must be ten channels to resolve each of ten stresses! If this opportunity matrix is understood and responded to, the city is truly functioning as an opportunity matrix. For example, opportunities for shelter could be through the channels of lodges, rented rooms, studio apartments, bedroom apartments and houses.  It could be through the channels of ownership, through a variety of tendencies.  It could be through opportunities for [[self-help]], or incremental housing.  It could be through the up-gradation of slums.  Intelligent urbanism promotes a wide range of solutions, where any stress is felt.  It therefore promotes a range of problem statements, options, and variable solutions to urban stresses.

Intelligent urbanism sees cities as processes.  Proponents argue that good urban plans facilitate those processes and do not place barriers before them.  For example, it does not judge a “slum" as a blight on society; it sees the possibility that such a settlement may be an opportunity channel for entry into the city.  Such a settlement may be the only affordable shelter, within easy access to employment and education, for a new immigrant household in the city.  According to intelligent urbanism, if the plan ignores, or destroys such settlements, it is creating a city of barriers and despair wherein a poor family, offering a good service to the city, is denied a modicum of basic needs for survival.  Alternatively, if the urban plan recognizes that the “slum" is a mechanism for [[Personal development|self development]], a spring-board from which children have access to education, a place which can be up-graded with potable water, basic sanitary facilities, [[street light]]s and paving…then it is a plan for opportunity.  Intelligent urbanism believes that there are slums of hope and slums of despair.  It promotes slums of hope, which contribute, not only to individual opportunities, but also to [[Nation-building|nation building]].

The opportunity matrix must also respond to young professionals, to skilled, well-paid [[day labor]]ers, to the [[upper middle class]] and to affluent entrepreneurs.   If a range of needs, of abilities to pay, of locational requirements, and of levels of development of shelter, is addressed, then opportunities are being created.

Intelligent urbanism believes that [[Capitalism|private enterprise]] is the logical provider of opportunities, but that alone it will not be just or effective.  The regime of land, left to [[Market Forces|market forces]] alone, will create an exclusive, dysfunctional society.  Intelligent urbanism believes that there is an essential role for the [[civil society]] to intervene in the opportunity matrix of the city.

Intelligent urbanism promotes opportunities through access to:

* Basic and primary education, skill development and knowledge about the  urban world;
* Basic health care, potable water, solid waste disposal and hygiene;
* Urban facilities like storm drainage, street lights, roads and footpaths;
* Recreation and entertainment;
* Transport, energy, communications;
* [[Public participation]] and debate;
* Finance and investment mechanisms;
* Land and/or built-up space where [[goods and services]] can be produced;
* Rudimentary economic infrastructure;
* Intelligent urbanism provides a wide range of zones, districts and precincts where activities and functions can occur without detracting from one another.

Intelligent urbanism proposes that enterprise can only flourish where a public framework provides opportunities for enterprise.  This system of opportunities operates through public investments in economic and social infrastructure; through incentives in the form of appropriate finance, tax inducements, subsidized skill development for workers, and: regulations which protect the environment, safety, hygiene and health. To ensure a stable playing field where one can make an investment with predictable returns, a modicum of regulation is necessary. Proponents argue that it is through government regulations that private investment can be protected from fraud. It is through government regulation that the under-pinning conditions for [[free enterprise]] can be protected.

===Principle eight: regional integration===
Intelligent urbanism envisions the city as an organic part of a larger environmental, [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] and cultural-geographic system, essential for its sustainability. This zone of influence is the region.  Likewise, it sees the region as integrally connected to the city.  Intelligent urbanism sees the planning of the city and its hinterland as a single holistic process.  Proponents argue if one does not recognize growth as a regional phenomenon, then development will play a [[hopscotch]] game of moving just a bit further along an arterial roads, further up valleys above the municipal jurisdiction,  staying beyond the path of the city boundary, development regulations and of the urban tax regime.

The region may be defined as the [[drainage basin|catchment area]] from which employees and students commute into the city on a daily basis. It is the catchment area from which people choose to visit one city, as opposed to another, for retail shopping and entertainment. Economically the city region may include the hinterland that depends on its wholesale markets, banking facilities, transport hubs and information exchanges. The region needing integration may be seen as the zone from which perishable foods, firewood and building materials supply the city.  The economic region can also be defined as the area managed by exchanges in the city.  Telephone calls to the region go through the city's telecom exchange; post goes through the city's general [[post office]]; money transfers go through the city’s [[financial institution]]s and internet data passes electronically through the city’s servers.  The area over which “city exchanges" disperse matter can well be called the city’s economic hinterland or region.  Usually the region includes dormitory communities, airports, water reservoirs, perishable food farms, hydro facilities, out-of-doors recreation and other infrastructure that serves the city.   Intelligent urbanism sees the integrated planning of these services and facilities as part of the city planning process.

Intelligent urbanism understands that the social and economic region linked to a city also has a physical form, or a geographic character.   A hierarchy of watersheds, creating valleys and defining edges of neighborhoods, may define the geographic character.  Forest ranges, fauna and avifauna habitats are set within such regions and are connected by natural corridors for movement and cross-fertilization.  Within this larger, environmental scenario, one must conceptualize urbanism in terms of watersheds, subterranean aquifer systems, and other natural systems that operate across the entire region.  Economic infrastructure, such as roads, hydro basins, irrigation channels, water reservoirs and related distribution networks usually follow the terrain of the [[regional geography]].  The region’s geographic portals, and lines of control, may also define defense and security systems deployment.

Intelligent urbanism recognizes that there is always a spillover of population from the city into the region, and that population in the region moves into the city for work, shopping, entertainment, health care and education.  With thoughtful planning the region can take pressure off of the city.  Traditional and new settlements within the urban region can be enhanced and densified to accommodate additional urban households.  There are many activities within the city, which are growing and are incompatible with urban habitat.  Large, noisy and polluting workshops and manufacturing units are amongst these.  Large wholesale markets, storage sheds, vehicular maintenance garages, and waste management facilities need to be housed outside of the city’s limits in their own satellite enclaves. In larger urban agglomerations a number of towns and cities are clustered around a major  urban center forming a metropolitan region.

Intelligent urbanism is not just planning for the present; it is also planning for the distant future.  Intelligent urbanism is not Utopian, but futuristic in its need to forecast the scenarios to come, within its own boundaries, and within the boundaries of the distant future.

===Principle nine: balanced movement===
Intelligent urbanism advocates integrated transport systems comprising walkways, cycle paths, bus lanes, light rail corridors, under-ground metros and automobile channels. A balance between appropriate modes of movement  is proposed. More capital intensive transport systems should move between high density nodes and hubs, which interchange with lower technology movement options. These modal split nodes become the public domains around which cluster high density, pedestrian, mixed-use urban villages (Taniguchi:2001).

The PIU accepts that the automobile is  here to stay, but that it should not be made essential by design. A well planned metropolis would densify along mass transit corridors and around major urban hubs. Smaller, yet dense, urban nodes are seen as micro-zones of medium level density, public amenities and pedestrian access. At these points lower level nodal split will occur, such as between bus loops and cycle tracts. The PIU views nodal split points as places of urban conviviality and access to services and facilities. Modal split can be between walking, cycling, driving, and mass transit. Bus loops may feed larger rail-based rapid-movement corridors. Social and economic infrastructure becomes more intensive as movement corridors become more intense.

===Principle ten: institutional integrity===
Intelligent urbanism holds that good practices inherent in considered principles can only be realized through accountable, transparent, competent and participatory local governance, founded on appropriate data bases, due entitlements, civic responsibilities and duties. The PIU promotes a range of facilitative and promotive urban development management tools to achieve appropriate urban practices, systems and forms(Islam:2000). None of the principles or practices the PIU promotes can be implemented unless there is a strong and rational institutional framework to define, channel and legalize urban development, in all of its aspects. Intelligent urbanism envisions the institutional framework as being very clear about the rules and regulations it sponsors and that those using discretion in implementing these measures must do so in a totally open, recorded and transparent manner.

Intelligent urbanism facilitates the public in carrying out their honest objectives.  It does not regulate and control the public.  It attempts to reduce the requirements, steps and documentation required for citizens to process their proposals.

Intelligent urbanism is also promotive in furthering the interests of the public in their genuine utilization of opportunities.  It promotes site and services schemes for households who can construct their own houses.  It promotes up-gradation of settlements with inadequate basic services.  It promotes innovative financing to a range of actors who can contribute to the city’s development.  Intelligent urbanism promotes a limited role for government, for example in “packaging" large-scale urban development schemes, so that the private sector is promoted to actually build and market urban projects, which were previously built by the government.

Intelligent urbanism does not consider itself naïve.  It recognizes that there are developers and promoters who have no long term commitment to their own constructions, and their only concern is to hand over a dwelling, gain their profit and move on.  For these players it is essential to have [[Development Control]] Regulations, which assure the public that the products they invest in are safe, hygienic, orderly, durable and efficient.  For the discerning citizen, such rules also lay out the civil understanding by which a [[complex society]] agrees to live together.

The PIU contends that there must be a cadastral System wherein all of the land in the jurisdiction of cities is demarcated, surveyed, characterized and archived, registering its legal owner, its legal uses, and the tax defaults against it.

The institutional framework can only operate where there is a Structure Plan, or other document that defines how the land will be used, serviced, and accessed.  The Structure Plan tells landowners and promoters what the parameters of development are, which assures that their immediate investments are secure, and that the returns and use of such efforts are predictable.   A Structure Plan is intended to provide owners and investors with predictable future scenarios.  Cities require efficient patterns for their main infrastructure systems and utilities.  According to PIU proponents, land needs to be used in a judicious manner, organizing complementary functions and activities into compact, mixed use precincts and separating out non-compatible uses into their own precincts.   In a similar manner, proponents argue it is only through a plan that heritage sites and the environment can be legally protected.  Public assets in the form of nature, religious places, heritage sites and open space systems must be designated in a legal plan.

Intelligent urbanism proposes that the city and its surrounding region be regulated by a Structure Plan, or equivalent mechanism, which acts as a [[legal instrument]] to guide the growth, development and enhancement of the city.

According to proponents, there must be a system of participation by the “Stake Holders" in the preparation of plans.  Public meetings, hearings of objections and transparent processes of addressing objections, must be institutionalized.  Intelligent urbanism promotes Public Participation.  Local Area Plans must be prepared which address local issues and take into account local views and sentiments regarding plan objectives, configurations, standards and patterns.  Such plans lay out the sites of plots showing the roads, public open spaces, amenities areas and conservation sites.  Land Pooling assures the beneficiaries from provision of public infrastructure and amenities proportionally contribute and that a few individuals do not suffer from reservations in the plan.

According to proponents, there must be a system of Floor Area Ratios to assure that the land and the services are not over pressured.  No single plot owner should have more than the determined "fair share" of utilization of the access roads, amenities and utilities that service all of the sites.  Floor Area Ratios temper this relationship as regulated the manner in which public services are consumed.  According to PIU proponents, [[Air rights|Transfer of Development Rights]] benefits land owners whose properties have been reserved under the plan.  It also benefits the local authorities that lack the financial resources to purchase lands to implement the [[Structure Plans]].  It benefits concentrated, [[Central business district|city center]] project promoters who have to amortize expensive land purchases, by allowing them to purchase the development rights from the owners of reserved lands and to hand over those properties to the plan implementing authority.  This allows the local authority to widen roads and to implement the Structure Plan.  The local authority then transfers the needed development right to city center promoters.

Intelligent urbanism supports the use of Architectural Guidelines where there is a tradition to preserve and where precedents can be used to specify architectural elements, motifs and language in a manner, which intended to reinforce a cultural tradition.  Building designs must respect traditional elements, even though the components may vary greatly to integrate contemporary functions. Even in a greenfield setting Architectural Guidelines are required to assure harmony and continuity of building proportions, scale, color, patterns, motifs, materials and facades.

Intelligent urbanism insists on safety, hygiene, durability and utility in the design and construction of buildings.  Where large numbers of people gather in schools, hospitals, and other  public facilities that may become [[emergency shelter]]s in disasters, special care must be exercised.  A suitable [[Building code|Building Code]] is the proposed instrument to achieve these aims.

PIU proponents state that those who design buildings must be professionally qualified architects; those who design the structures (especially of more than ground plus two levels) must be professionally qualified structural engineers; those who build buildings must be qualified civil engineers; and, those who supervise and control construction must be qualified construction managers.  Intelligent urbanism promotes the professionalisation of the city making process.  While promoting professionalism, intelligent urbanism proposes that this not become a barrier in the development process.  Small structures, low-rise structures, and humble structures that do not house many people can be self designed and constructed by the inhabitants themselves.  Proponents maintain that there must be recognized Professional Accrediting Boards, or Professional Bodies, to see that urban development employs adequate technical competence.

Finally, there must be legislation creating statutory [[Local government|local authorities]], and empowering them to act, manage, invest, service, protect, promote and facilitate urban development and all of the opportunities that a modern city must sponsor.

Intelligent urbanism insists that cities, local authorities, regional development commissions and planning agencies be professionally managed.  City Managers can be hired to manage the delivery of services, the planning and management of planned development, the maintenance of utilities and the creation of amenities.

Intelligent urbanism views plans and urban designs and housing configurations as expressions of the people for whom they are planned.  The processes of planning must therefore be a participatory involving a range of stakeholders.  The process must be a transparent one, which makes those privileged to act as guardians of the people’s will accountable for their decisions and choices.  Intelligent urbanism sees urban planning and city governance as the most salient expressions of civility.  Intelligent urbanism fosters the evolution of institutional systems that enhance transparency, accountability and rational public decision making.

==Movements implementing the ten principles==
Though not necessarily related to the principles of intelligent urbanism, there are examples representing all or some of them in urban design theory and practice.
Concurrently, the recent movements of [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical Architecture]] promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.org/charter Charter of the New Urbanism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|globally uniform]] architecture, as well as leaning against solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities]. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Both trends started in the 1980s. The [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] is an award that recognizes efforts in New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture, and is endowed with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref name="Driehaus Prize"&gt;{{cite web|title=Driehaus Prize|url=http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/|work=''Together, the $200,000 Driehaus Prize and the $50,000 Reed Award represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment.''|publisher=Notre Dame School of Architecture|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7260">The '''purple economy''' is that part of the [[economy]] which contributes to [[sustainable development]] by promoting the cultural potential of goods and services.

“The purple economy refers to taking account of cultural aspects in economics. It designates an economy that adapts to the human diversity in globalization and that relies on the cultural dimension to give value to goods and services.”&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.lejournaldesarts.fr/jda/archives/docs_article/89661/lactualite-vue-par-jerome-gouadain-promoteur-du-concept-d---economie-mauve---.php Le Journal des Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; These two trends, one vertical and one horizontal, feed one another. In fact the growth in the cultural component attached to products is linked to each territory’s cultural vitality.

== Surge in culture ==
The context of the purple economy is that of the growing importance of culture in contemporary society. The factors involved in this include in particular:&lt;ref name=diversum20170630&gt;Diversum, Gilles Andrier, Loïc Armand, Francesco Bandarin, Jérôme Bédier, Françoise Benhamou, Fouad Benseddik, Gilles Boëtsch, [[Dominique Bourg]], Jérôme Gouadain, Maria Gravari-Barbas, Marc-Antoine Jamet, [[François Jullien]], [[Pascal Lamy]], [[Jacques Lévy]], [[Gilles Lipovetsky]], Françoise Montenay, Jean Musitelli, Patrick O’Quin, Philippe d’Ornano, [[Dominique Perrault]], Marie-Hélène Plainfossé, Nicole Rouvet, [http://diversum.net/fr/association/a.php?t=document-de-reference&amp;id=74presse| “The Cultural Footprint of the Cosmetic Sector”] (accessed 22 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; a global economic and political readjustment in favour of emerging countries, a return to local environments (once again perceived as centres for stability), new forms of claims (following on from the collapse of the great ideologies), growing social demand for quality based on cultural consumption patterns (which go hand in hand with the logic of popularization, individualization and longer life expectancies), innovative approaches (that presuppose a cultural state of mind and interdisciplinarity conducive to [[serendipity]]), and so on.

== Scope ==
The purple economy is multidisciplinary, in that it enriches all goods and services by capitalizing on the cultural dimension inherent to every sector. The sensory, experiential economy is one application of this.&lt;ref name=diversum20170630/&gt;

It differs from the [[Economics of the arts and literature|cultural economy]], which is sector-based.

In June 2013, the conclusions of a first inter-institutional working group on the purple economy, formed of experts from [[UNESCO]], the [[OECD]], the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|International Organisation of the Francophonie]], French ministries, various companies and civil society. That document underscored the impact of the phenomenon of culturalization, which now affects the entire economy, with follow-on effects on employment and training. The report differentiates between ''purple jobs'' and ''purplifying professions'': the former are directly linked to the cultural environment by their very purpose (like town planners and developers), while the latter are merely caused to transform under the effect of culturalization (such as positions in human resources or in marketing and communications).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diversum.net/fichiers/File/The%20purple%20economy,%20an%20objective,%20an%20opportunity.pdf Conclusions of the first inter-institutional working group on the purple economy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reference document published in June 2017&lt;ref name=diversum20170630/&gt; mentioned various aspects of the human environment in which economics are likely to produce cultural benefits: architecture, art, colours, enjoyment, ethics, heritage, imagination, learning, social skills, singularity, etc.

== Origin ==
The term first appeared in 2011, in France, in a manifest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2011/05/19/l-economie-mauve-une-nouvelle-alliance-entre-culture-et-economie_1524674_3232.html Le Monde.fr]&lt;/ref&gt; published on [[Le Monde|Le Monde.fr]]. The signatories&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Jacques Aillagon]], Bruno Bourg-Broc, [[Bernard Cerquiglini]], Gilles Ciment, [[Joëlle Garriaud-Maylam]], José Luís Dicenta Ballester, [[Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres]], [[Mercedes Erra]], Pierre-Antoine Gailly, Jérôme Gouadain, [[Claudie Haigneré]], [[Jean-Hervé Lorenzi]], Jean Musitelli, Alain-Dominique Perrin, Odile Quintin, [[Bernard Ramanantsoa]], Jean-François Rial, Pierre Simon.&lt;/ref&gt; included the board members of the association Diversum,&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Cerquiglini]], [[Joëlle Garriaud-Maylam]], Jérôme Gouadain, [[Jean-Hervé Lorenzi]], Jean Musitelli, Odile Quintin, Pierre Simon. [http://www.diversum.net/fichiers/File/Asso_diversum_10-05-2010_en.pdf Source]&lt;/ref&gt; which organized the first International Purple Economy Forum under the patronage of [[UNESCO]], the [[European Parliament]] and the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.purple-economy.org Website of the International Purple Economy Forum]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connection to sustainable development ==
[[File:Sustainable economy.gif|thumb|The three components of a sustainable economy]]

The purple economy emphasizes the presence of [[externalities]]: the cultural environment from which agents draw and on which, in return, they leave their own footprints is a [[common good]]. As a result, the purple economy sees culture as an axis for [[sustainable development]].

In fact, culture has been a whole sub-section of sustainability since the beginning. [[Corporate social responsibility]] can even be said to have originated in the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] adopted by the United Nations in 1966.

This issue is just one of the different components of [[sustainable development]], alongside concerns relating to the [[natural environment]] ([[green economy]]) and to the [[social environment]] ([[social economy]]). The complementary nature of these aspects of the sustainable economy was reaffirmed in a call&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2015/06/30/la-reponse-au-rechauffement-est-aussi-culturelle_4664807_3232.html Le Monde Économie]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;By: [[Pierre Bellon]], Véronique Cayla, [[Bertrand P.

== Issues of authenticity ==
The issue of authenticity of Moai heads may never be fully resolved. The fact is that the rocks used to carve the heads are as old as the volcano eruption that formed them, so carbon 14 testing reveals no evidence of authenticity. The age of the Moai heads on the island cannot be determined, and off the island, heads can only be determined to be made from Easter Island volcanic rock or not made from Easter Island volcanic rock. Determining the age of an Easter Island Moai head is therefore an art, and not a science. Field experts make judgments and express opinions about what tools they feel were used and attempt to tie an age to that
opinion.
Such a condition means that Moai Heads cannot be tested with hope of determining authenticity; they may, however, be brought under suspicion of being fakes. As with any object of antiquity, the patrimony, the history and story of the heads, is an important part in determining authenticity. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}
 
An unauthenticated moai head entitled "Henry" currently stands in the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale]], California. It was obtained in the first half of the 20th century by the founder of the park Dr. Hubert Eaton. Dr. Eaton received the moai in a legal transaction between Rapanui fishermen at Easter Island who were using the head (approx 1m height) as ballast for a boat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lapidaryjournal.com/archive/50/nov1954.cfm Lapidary Journal, (November/December 1954) "The story behind Henry".]&lt;/ref&gt; The Memorial Park has no plans for authenticating or testing the moai in the near future.

In 2003, the Chilean government began an investigation into two moai heads within a set of 15 other Easter Island artefacts&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2633865.stm Porteous, Clinton. BBC News (January 7, 2003) "Chile probes Easter Island artefacts".]&lt;/ref&gt; — the possessions of Hernan Garcia de Gonzalo Vidal — which were put on sale at The Cronos gallery in Miami. After a photographic inspection by Patricia Vargas, an archaeologist at the University of Chile's Easter Island institute, she commented that ""They might be nice art pieces, but I doubt any one is 500 years old. It appears that the cuts have been made with modern machinery and not with stone tools." A meeting arranged between the Chilean newspaper [[El Mercurio]] which first reported the sale, and Hernan Garcia Gonzalo de Vidal, later failed to take place when Mr Gonzalo de Vidal became unavailable due to a "family emergency".&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,872690,00.html Franklin, Jonathan. The Guardian, (January 11, 2003), "Mystery looms over stone heads".]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Replicas ===
In 1968, a moai (possibly Moai 35-001) was taken from [[Rapa Nui]] and displayed in [[New York City]] as a publicity stunt to oppose the building of a jet refueling facility on Easter Island.&lt;ref&gt;Glueck, Grace. New York Times, (October 22, 1968) "5-Ton Head From Easter Island is put on a Pedestal".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landmarksfoundation.org/articles/MadisonSiteSpecificArticle.html Slonim, Jeffrey. Madison Magazine, (1999), "Site Specific".]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelope.com/archive/2006_04_01_archive.html Holmes, Greg. The Lope, (April 15, 2006) "Happy Easter Island", correspondence with Samuel Adams Green.]&lt;/ref&gt; Around the time of the campaign and the following tour to Washington D.C. and Chicago, the moai was received by the Lippincott company of North Haven, [[Connecticut]], which since its inception in 1966 had provided a "place for artists to create large sculptures and receive help in transportation and installation of their work".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/collections_list.cfm/fuseaction/Collections.ViewCollection/CollectionID/9147/search_letter/L Smithsonian archives of American art. (September 23, 2007) List of Collections and Interviews A-Z.]&lt;/ref&gt; In co-operation with the [[World Monuments Fund|International Fund for Monuments Inc]], Lippincott produced a copy from the original moai (before it was confiscated by the Chilean government) and claimed the rights to execute the work on 100 further replicas.

In 1974, Object No. 3 was produced from the copy, and now stands outside the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5533">'''Reverse electrodialysis''' ('''RED''') is the [[salinity gradient]] energy retrieved from the difference in the salt [[concentration]] between [[seawater]] and [[Fresh water|river water]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1980OcEng...7....1L 1980 - energy by reverse electrodialysis]&lt;/ref&gt; A method of utilizing the energy produced by this process by means of a heat engine was invented by Prof. [[Sidney Loeb]] in 1977 at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.
[http://www.google.com/patents/US4171409 --United States Patent US4171409]

In reverse [[electrodialysis]] a salt solution and fresh water are let through a stack of alternating cation and anion exchange membranes. The chemical potential difference between salt and fresh water generates a voltage over each membrane and the total potential of the system is the sum of the potential differences over all membranes. The process works through difference in ion concentration instead of an electric field, which has implications for the type of membrane needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mtg.tnw.utwente.nl/teaching/assign/blue/ See note 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927220919/http://mtg.tnw.utwente.nl/teaching/assign/blue/ |date=2008-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In RED, as in a [[fuel cell]], the cells are stacked. A module with a capacity of 250&amp;nbsp;kW has the size of a shipping container.

In the [[Netherlands]], for example, more than 3,300 m³ fresh water runs into the sea per second on average. The membrane halves the pressure differences which results in a water column of approximately 135&amp;nbsp;meters. The energy potential is therefore e=[[Potential energy#Gravitational potential energy|mg&amp;Delta;h]]=3.3*10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg/s*10&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;*135&amp;nbsp;meters ca.= 4.5*10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Joule]] per second, Power=4.5 gigawatts.

These numbers do not work out correctly: see Talk. Theoretically the output is 2.5 MJ or 0.5 kWh/m³. This corresponds to about 3,000 MW, which is about one-third of the national electricity consumption ([[2005]]).

"14*3300 bars m^3/sec" yields 4.6 GW (type it into a Google search box) so the numbers work out okay.~~~

==Development==
In 2006 a 50&amp;nbsp;kW plant was located at a coastal test site in [[Harlingen, Netherlands|Harlingen]], the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leonardo-energy.org/drupal/book/export/html/2243 Blue energy]&lt;/ref&gt; the focus being on prevention of [[biofouling]] of the [[anode]], [[cathode]], and membranes and increasing the membrane performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tbk.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/root/2008/JMembrSciVeerman/2008JMembrSciVeerman.pdf electrodialysis stacks by a validated model]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netserver2.net/waterforum/index.asp?url=/template_a1.asp&amp;que=paginanr=3716 Friese wereldprimeur met stroomproductie uit zoet-zout water]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the Directorate for Public Works and Water Management, Redstack, and ENECO signed a declaration of intent for development of a pilot plant on the [[Afsluitdijk]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporateuk.eneco.nl/pages/default.asp?PageID=60&amp;Mainmenu=News%20and%20media&amp;MainmenuID=45&amp;Mainmenusub=Press%20releases&amp;MainmenusubID=60&amp;ShowNieuws=13424&amp;ModuleitemID=424 Electricity from fresh and salt water]&lt;/ref&gt; The plant was put into service on 26 November 2014 and produces 50 kW of electricity to show the technical feasibility in real-life conditions using fresh IJsselmeer water and salt water from the Wadden Sea. Theoretically, with 1m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s river water and an equal amount of sea water, approximately 1 MW of renewable electricity can be recovered at this location by upscaling the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dutch King opens world's first RED power plant driven on fresh-salt water mixing|url=http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/12388-dutch-king-opens-world-s-first-red-power-plant-driven-on-fresh-salt-water-mixing.html|publisher=Dutch Water Sector|accessdate=4 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416092205/http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/12388-dutch-king-opens-world-s-first-red-power-plant-driven-on-fresh-salt-water-mixing.html|archivedate=16 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is to be expected that after this phase the installation could be further expanded to a final capacity of 200 MW.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4118">The '''sacred–profane dichotomy''' is an idea posited by [[France|French]] [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]], who considered it to be the central characteristic of [[religion]]: "religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to ''sacred things'', that is to say, things set apart and forbidden."&lt;ref&gt;Emile Durkheim, ''The elementary forms of Religious Life'', ed. and trans. by Karen E. Fields. (New York: The Free Press, 1995), p. 35.[http://home.ku.edu.tr/~mbaker/cshs503/durkheimreligiouslife.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In Durkheim's theory, the [[Sacred (comparative religion)|sacred]] represented the interests of the group, especially unity, which were embodied in sacred group symbols, or ''[[totems]]''. The [[profanum|profane]], on the other hand, involved mundane individual concerns. Durkheim explicitly stated that the sacred–profane dichotomy was not equivalent to [[good and evil|good/evil]]. The sacred could be good or evil, and the profane could be either as well.&lt;ref&gt;Pals 1996, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim's claim of the universality of this dichotomy for all religions/[[cult]]s has been criticized by scholars such as British [[anthropologist]] [[Jack Goody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p35161/mobile/ch06s03.html|title=The sacred-profane distinction is not universal|last=|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2007-07-10|work=}} quote: "neither do the [[Lo Dagaa]] [group in Gonja, ''editor note''] appear to have any concepts at all equivalent to the vaguer and not unrelated dichotomy between the sacred and the profane"&lt;/ref&gt; Goody also noted that "many societies have no words that translate as sacred or profane and that ultimately, just like the distinction between natural and supernatural, it was very much a product of [[European religious thought]] rather than a universally applicable criterion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11183/Sacred-Profane-Durkheim-s-Critics.html |title=Sacred and Profane - Durkheim's Critics |accessdate=2007-07-10 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Tomoko Masuzawa explains in ''The Invention of World Religions: Or, How European Universalism Was Preserved in the Language of Pluralism'', this system of comparative religion privileged Christianity at the expense of non-Christian systems (2005). Any cosmology without a sacred/profane binary was rendered invisible by the field of religious studies, because the binary was supposed to be 'universal'.

Part of the [[Simulacra and Simulation|three order simulacra]], the '''second-order simulacra''', a term coined by [[Jean Baudrillard]], are [[symbol]]s of a non faithful representation to the original. Here, signs and images do not faithfully show us reality, but might hint at the existence of something real which the sign itself is incapable of encapsulating.&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard 1994 [1981], Simulacra and Simulation, University of Michigan Press, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

While the first-order simulacra is a faithful copy to the original and the third order are symbols that have become without referents, that is, symbols with no real object to represent but pretends to be a faithful copy of an original. Simply put, a third-order simulacra are symbols in themselves taken for reality and further layer of [[symbol]]ism is added. This occurs when the symbol is taken to be more important or authoritative of the original entity, authenticity has been replaced by copy (thus reality is replaced by a substitute).

The consequence of the propagation of second-order [[simulacra]] is that, within the affected context, nothing is "real," though those engaged in the illusion are incapable of seeing it. Instead of having experiences, people observe spectacles, via real or [[metaphor]]ical control screens. Instead of the real, we have simulation and simulacra, the [[Hyperreality|hyperreal]].

In his essay "The Precession of the Simulacra," Baudrillard recalls a tale from a short story by [[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]] in which a king requests a map (i.e. a symbol) to be produced so detailed that it ends up coming into one-to-one correspondence with the territory (i.e. the real area the map is to represent); this references the philosophical concept of [[map–territory relation]]. Baudrillard argues that in the [[postmodern]] epoch, the territory ceases to exist, and there is nothing left but the map; or indeed, the very concepts of the map and the territory have become indistinguishable, the distinction which once existed between them having been erased.

Among the many issues associated with the propagation of second-order simulacra to the third-order is what Baudrillard considers the termination of history. The method of this termination comes through the lack of oppositional elements in society, with the mass having become "the [[silent majority]]," an imploded concept which absorbs images passively, becoming itself a media overwritten by those who speak for it (i.e. the people are symbolically represented by governing agents and market statistic, marginalizing the people themselves). For Baudrillard this is the natural result of an ethic of unity in which actually agonistic opposites are taken to be essentially the same. For example, Baudrillard contends that [[moral universalism]] (human rights, equality) is equated with [[globalization]], which is not concerned with immutable values but with mediums of exchange and equalisation such as the global market and [[mass media]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6839">'''''Sheilaism''''' is a shorthand term for an individual's system of religious belief which co-opts strands of multiple religions chosen by the individual usually without much theological consideration. The term derives from a woman named Sheila Larson, who is quoted by [[Robert N. Bellah]] et al. in their book ''Habits of the Heart'' as following her own "little voice" in a faith she calls "Sheilaism".{{sfn|Bellah|Madsen|Sullivan|Swidler|1985|p=221}}

==History==
In chapter 9 of their 1985 book ''Habits of the Heart'', [[Robert N. Bellah]], Richard Madsen, William M. Sullivan, [[Ann Swidler]], and Steven M. Tipton discuss how religion in America has moved from being highly public and unified, as it was in [[colonial New England]], to extremely private and diverse. To demonstrate the shift, they quote a young nurse, to whom they gave the name Sheila Larson:
{{quote|I believe in God. I'm not a religious fanatic. I can't remember the last time I went to church. My faith has carried me a long way. It's Sheilaism. Just my own little voice&amp;nbsp;... It's just try to love yourself and be gentle with yourself. You know, I guess, take care of each other. I think He would want us to take care of each other.}}

Bellah et al. suggest that Sheilaism creates the logical possibility "of over 220 million American religions, one for each of us," and they see Sheilaism as "a perfectly natural expression of current American religious life".{{sfn|Bellah|Madsen|Sullivan|Swidler|1985|p=221}} Oddrun M.&amp;nbsp;H. Bråten wrote:
{{quote|Radically individualistic religion like "Sheilaism" may seem very different from, for example, fundamentalist religion, which is also characteristic of our time, but they both emphasise personal religious experience (spirituality). "Sheilaism" is rooted in an attempt to transform external authority to internal meaning. Some may prefer to choose a religion of external authority (Bellah 1985: 235) for this purpose. That religion in principle is a choice, is a result of the religious freedom gained in the western world through [[secularization]]: a central trait of western modernity ([[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Taylor]] 2004: 185, Taylor 2007, see also chapter 2).{{sfn|Bråten|2013|p=171}}}}

The coinage quickly became a touchstone for [[sociology of religion|sociologists of religion]] who repeatedly reference it.{{sfn|Wood|2009|p=241}} One sociologist summed it up as "spiritual [[bricolage]]".{{sfn|Wilcox|2002|p=498}} Sheilaism even has worked its way into more mainstream culture.

The columnist Don Kahle concluded that Sheila "has a code of ethics, but it's no longer connected to a sacred text or an observing deity. It's personal&amp;nbsp;– and unpublished. Sheila abides by Sheilaism. Sheilaism is good for Sheila, but it doesn't build community. Nobody but Sheila knows what are the codes of Sheilaism. Often Sheila doesn't know herself until something 'doesn't feel right'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kahle |first=Don |date=26 October 2007 |title=Will Downtown Progress Be Thwarted? Blame Sheila |url=http://www.dksez.com/if-downtown-plan-gets-thwarted-blame-sheila/ |newspaper=The Register-Guard |location=Eugene, Oregon |page=A13 |issn=0739-8557 |access-date=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Bellah et al. saw Sheilaism as a form of self-absorption that caused a disaffiliation with communities. Their perspective was very much in line with the prevailing view of sociologists since the 1960s who saw such highly individualized religious experience as proof of a larger decline in the importance of religion in the United States as a whole.{{sfn|Wilcox|2002|p=498}} In later comments, Bellah summed up the problem with Sheilaism: "she has made the inner trip and hasn't come back out again, so to speak."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bellah |first=Robert |year=1986 |title=Habits of the Heart: Implications for Religion |url=http://www.robertbellah.com/lectures_5.htm |type=lecture |location=Hartford, Connecticut |publisher=Hartford Seminary |access-date=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural critic [[Hal Niedzviecki]] juxtaposes Sheilaism with Judyism, the joke religion created by comedian [[Judy Tenuta]]. Whereas Tenuta is poking fun at the idea of an individualist religion, even titling a book ''The Power of Judyism'', Niedzviecki laments the fact that Sheilaists take the idea seriously. "Sheilaism permeates our individualistic conformity and continues to demand that our institutions dramatically change to accept us as we want to be."{{sfn|Niedzviecki|2006|p=49}}

Recent scholarship has re-evaluated Sheilaism, noting that even those who claim a particular organized denomination and regularly attend church often have highly individualized perceptions of their faith.{{sfn|Wilcox|2002|p=500}}

'''Sustainability standards and certifications''' are voluntary, usually third party-assessed, norms and standards relating to environmental, social, ethical and food safety issues, adopted by companies to demonstrate the performance of their organizations or products in specific areas.  There are perhaps up to 500 such standards{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} and the pace of introduction has increased in the last decade{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.  The trend started in the late 1980s and 90s with the introduction of [[Ecolabel]]s and standards for [[Organic food]] and other products. In recent years, numerous standards have been established and adopted in the food industry in particular{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Most of them refer to the triple bottom line of environmental quality, social equity, and economic prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1678472 Overview article on sustainability standards in the food industry]&lt;/ref&gt; A standard is normally developed by a broad range of stakeholders and experts in a particular sector and includes a set of practices or criteria for how a crop should be sustainable grown or a resource should be ethically harvested. This might cover, for instance, responsible fishing practices that don't endanger marine biodiversity, or respect for human rights and the payment of fair wages on a coffee or tea plantation. Normally sustainability standards are accompanied by a verification process - often referred to as "certification" - to evaluate that an enterprise complies with a standard, as well as a traceability process for certified products to be sold along the supply chain, often resulting in a consumer-facing label. Certification programmes also focus on capacity building and working with partners and other organisations to support smallholders or disadvantaged producers to make the social and environmental improvements needed to meet the standard.

The basic premise of sustainability standards is twofold.  Firstly, they emerged in areas where national and global legislation was weak but where the consumer and [[NGO]] movements around the globe demanded action.  For example, campaigns by Global Exchange&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030618203029/http://www.globalexchange.org/campaigns/sweatshops/nike/ |Global Exchange Campaign - Nike]&lt;/ref&gt; and other NGOs against the purchase of goods from “[[sweatshop]]” factories by the likes of [[Nike, Inc.]], [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.]] and other leading brands led to the emergence of social welfare standards like the [[SA8000]] and others.  Secondly, leading brands selling to both consumers and to the [[Business-to-business|B2B]] supply chain may wish to demonstrate the environmental or organic merits of their products, which has led to the emergence of hundreds of ecolabels{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, organic and other standards.  A leading example of a consumer standard is the [[Fairtrade]] movement, administered by [[FLO International]] and exhibiting huge sales growth around the world for ethically sourced produce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/press_office/press_releases_and_statements/jun_2009/global_fairtrade_sales_increase_by_22.aspx Fairtrade Growth] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225094221/http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/press_office/press_releases_and_statements/jun_2009/global_fairtrade_sales_increase_by_22.aspx |date=2010-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of a [[Business-to-business|B2B]] standard which has grown tremendously in the last few years is the [[Forest Stewardship Council]]’s standard (FSC) for forest products made from sustainable harvested trees.

However, the line between consumer and B2B sustainability standards is becoming blurred, with leading trade buyers increasingly demanding Fairtrade certification, for example, and consumers increasingly recognizing the FSC mark. In recent years, the business-to-business focus of sustainability standards has risen as it has become clear that consumer demand alone cannot drive the transformation of major sectors and industries{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. In commodities such as palm oil, soy, farmed seafood, and sugar, certification initiatives are targeting the mainstream adoption of better practices and [[precompetitive]] industry collaboration. Major brands and retailers are also starting to make commitments to certification in their whole supply chain or product offering, rather than a single product line or ingredient{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} .

With the growth of standards and certification as the major tool for global production and trade to become more sustainable and for the private sector to demonstrate sustainability leadership, it is essential that there are ways to assess the legitimacy and performance of different initiatives. Company and government buyers, as well as NGOs and civil society groups committed to sustainable production, need clarity on which standards and ecolabels are delivering ''real'' social, environmental and economic results. The [[ISEAL Alliance]] has emerged as the authority on good practice for sustainability standards and its Codes of Good Practice represent the most widely recognised guidance on how standards should be set up and implemented in order to be effective{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. By complying with these Codes and working with other certification initiatives, ISEAL members demonstrate their credibility and work towards improving their positive impacts.

Attempts to address the problems caused by a multiplicity of certification initiatives led to the launch of [[State of Sustainability Initiatives|The State of Sustainability Initiatives (SSI)]] project, facilitated by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) and the [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] (IISD) under the auspices of the Sustainable Commodity Initiative (SCI){{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

== Origin of global standards ==

''Most'' sustainability standards that are being adopted today were initiated by [[social movements]] in particular countries, such as Rainforest Alliance in the United States and Fairtrade in the Netherlands{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Other standards were initiated by individual companies, such as [[UTZ Certified|Utz Certified]] (Ahold), Starbucks C.A.F.E. (Starbucks), and Nespresso AAA (Nespresso). Some standards were launched by coalitions of private firms, development agencies, NGOs, and other stakeholders. For example, the Common Code for the Coffee Community (4C) was initiated by an alliance of large American coffee roasters, including [[Kraft Foods]], [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]] and [[Nestle]], assisted by the German Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development ([[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|GIZ]]). One important facilitator for the development of most global standards were series of local development projects involving NGOs, coffee roasters and producers in different developing countries. For example, the Fairtrade standard was developed based on pilot projects with Mexican farmers. 4C builds on development projects in Peru, Colombia and Vietnam, involving GIZ, major coffee roasters, and local producers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1668888 Article on the Development of the Common Code for the Coffee Community]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely established and adopted standards are in agriculture, with 40% of global coffee production certified to one of the main schemes, and approximately 15-20% of cocoa and tea production being compliant with major international standards. Forestry and wild seafood are also sectors in which standards have been influential, with certified production pushing past 10% of the global share. Cotton, palm oil, soy, biofuels and farmed seafood are some of the commodities in which certification is growing the fastest, due in part to major roundtables that have been set up to bring the whole industry together. More recently, standards have started to emerge for mining and the extraction of metals - including gold, silver, aluminium, and oil and gas - as well as for cattle, electronics, plastics and tourism.

Evidence suggests that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) adopted willingly by firms will be much more effective than government regulated CSR so global standards by private companies show promise for effective social impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=J. Scott|last2=Green|first2=Kesten C.|title=Effects of corporate social responsibility and irresponsibility policies|journal=Journal of Business Research|date=2013|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/43007/1/MPRA_paper_43007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the [[ISEAL Alliance]] in 2002 was the first collaborative effort amongst a group of sustainability standards organisations to agree to follow common good practices in how their standards are implemented and also to work together to drive up the use of standards and certification globally.

== Different sustainability standards ==
{{Tone|date=May 2017}}

Numerous sustainability standards have been developed in recent years to address issues of environmental quality, social equity, and economic prosperity of global production and trade practices. Despite similarities in major goals and certification procedures, there are some significant differences in terms of their historical development, target groups of adopters, geographical diffusion, and emphasis on environmental, social or economic issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1678472 Introduction to different standards]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major differences to be aware of is based on the level of strictness of the standard. Some standards set the bar high for a sector, promoting the strongest social and environmental practices and working with the top performers to constantly push up sustainability expectations{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Other standards are more focused on the elimination of the worst practices and operate at more of an entry-level to get a large proportion of an industry working incrementally towards better practices. Often times there are strategies between standards to move producers along this performance ladder of sustainability{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Another important distinction is that some standards can be applied internationally (usually with mechanisms to ensure local relevance and appropriateness) whereas other standards are developed entirely with a regional or national focus{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

Additional differences between standards might relate to the certification process and whether it is conducted by a first, second or third party; the traceability system in place and whether it allows for the segregation or mixing of certified and non-certified materials; and the types of sustainability claims that are made on products.

=== Fairtrade ===

The [[Fairtrade]] label was developed in the late 1980s by a Dutch development agency in collaboration with Mexican farmers{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. The initiative performs [[development work]] and promotes its political vision of an [[alternative economy]], seeing its main objective in empowering small producers and providing these with access to and improving their position on global markets{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. The ''most distinguishing'' feature of the Fairtrade label is the guarantee of a minimum price and a [[social premium]] that goes to the cooperative and not to the producers directly. Recently{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, Fairtrade also adopted environmental objectives as part of their certification system.

=== Rainforest Alliance ===
{{Tone|date=May 2017}}
The [[Rainforest Alliance]] was created in the late 1980s from a social movement and is committed to conserving rainforests and their biodiversity. One key element of the standard is the compulsory elaboration and implementation of a detailed plan for the development of a sustainable farm management system to assist wildlife conservation. Another objective is to improve workers’ welfare by establishing and securing ''sustainable'' livelihoods. Producer prices may carry a premium. Yet instead of guaranteeing a fixed [[floor price]], the standard seeks to improve the economic situation of producers through higher yields and enhanced cost efficiency{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

=== Utz Certified ===

[[UTZ Certified]] (formerly Utz Kapeh) was co-founded by the Dutch coffee roaster [[Ahold Coffee Company]] in 1997. It aims to create an open and transparent marketplace for socially and environmentally responsible agricultural products. ''Instruments'' include the UTZ Traceability System and the UTZ Code of Conduct. The traceability system makes certified products traceable from producer to final buyer and has ''stringent'' chains of custody requirements. The UTZ Code of Conduct emphasizes both environmental practices (e.g. biodiversity conservation, waste handling and water use) and social benefits (e.g. access to medical care, access to sanitary facilities at work).

=== Organic ===
The [[Organic farming|Organic]] standard was developed in the 1970s and is based on [[IFOAM]] Basic Standards{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. IFOAM stands for International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements and is the leading global umbrella organization for the organic farming movement. The IFOAM Basic Standards provide a framework of minimum requirements, including the omission of agrochemicals such as pesticides and chemical-synthetic fertilizers. The use of animal feeds is also strictly regulated. Genetic engineering and the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are forbidden{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

=== trustea ===

The [http://www.trustea.org trustea code] is designed to evaluate the social, economic, [[agronomic]] and environmental performance of Indian tea estates, smallholders and Bought Leaf Factories (BLFs).

It is expected that the compliance with the code not only improves competitiveness of the tea farms but also facilitates the tea farms in achieving compliance with national regulations and international sustainability standards in a step-wise approach. The applicable control points under eleven chapters are required to be adhered to within a four-year period. The India tea code allows producers to show that they operate responsibly– producing quality tea according to strict social and environmental standards. The verification under the code provides manufacturers with the assurance of responsible production and provides opportunities to credibly demonstrate this to their customers.

=== SuRe® – The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure ===

SuRe® is a global voluntary standard which integrates key criteria of resilience and sustainability into infrastructure development, through various criteria across governance, social and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gib-foundation.org/sure-standard/&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently developed under ISEAL guidelines by the Swiss [[Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation]] (GIB) and the French bank [[Natixis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ictsd.org/bridges-news/bridges-africa/news/sustainable-trade-infrastructure-in-africa-a-key-element-for-growth&lt;/ref&gt; GIB and Natixis launched the SuRe® standard at a [[COP21]] event on 9 December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greeneconomycoalition.org/updates/gib-launches-sure%C2%AE-standard-cop21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other examples===
Other types of standards include sector-specific schemes such as the [[Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil]] (RSPO); standards for climate and development interventions like the Gold Standard, retailer-led sustainability certification initiatives such as [[GlobalGAP]];
Corporate own-brand sustainability initiatives such as [[Starbucks#Coffee and Farmer Equity .28C.A.F.E..29 practices|Starbucks' CAFE Practices]]; and national programmes such as the [[Bord Bia|Irish Food Board]]'s 'Origin Green' scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agritrade.cta.int/Agriculture/Topics/Product-differentiation/Special-report-Implications-of-sustainability-certification-schemes-for-the-ACP ''Agritrade'': Implications of sustainability certification schemes for the ACP] 16 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Forum on Sustainability Standards]] (UNFSS) is a joint initiative of FAO, UNEP, ITC, UNCTAD, and UNIDO on Sustainability Standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Forum on Sustainability Standards|url=https://unfss.org|website=UNFSS|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tafwid''' ({{lang-ar|تفويض}}) is an Arabic term meaning "relegation" or "delegation", with uses in theology and law.&lt;ref name=ODOI/&gt;

== In theology ==

In Islamic theology, ''tafwid'' (or ''tafwid al-amr li-llah'', relegation of matters to God) is a doctrine according to which the meanings of the ambiguous verses of the [[Qur'an]] should be consigned to God alone.&lt;ref name=ODOI&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VeCWQfVNjkC&amp;pg=PA310|title=Tafwid|encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of Islam|editor=John L.

The doctrine of ''tafwid'', which was held by a number of classical scholars such as [[al-Ghazali]] and whose origin they attributed to the ''[[salaf]]'' (exemplary early Muslims), states that the Quranic expressions such as 'God's hands' or 'face' do not carry the literal meanings like their counterparts in human beings. Rather they are attributes or qualities of God and not organs like the face or hands of human beings.&lt;ref name="Phd338"&gt;{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. Dissertation|last=Shah |first=Zulfikar|date=March 1997 |title=A Study of Anthropomorphism and Transcendence in the Bible and Qur'an.

On this matter, we follow the early Muslims ([[salaf]]): [[Malik]], [[Awza'i]], [[Thawri]], [[Al-Layth ibn Sa'd|Layth ibn Sa'd]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], [[Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh]], and others among the Imams of the Muslims, both ancient and modern that is, to let (the verse in question) pass as it has come, without saying how it is meant (min ghayr takyif), without likening it to created things (wa la tashbih), and without nullifying it (wa la ta'til): The literal meaning ([[zahir (Islam)|zahir]]) that occurs to the minds of anthropomorphists (al-mushabbihin) is negated of Allah, for nothing from His creation resembles Him: '''"There is nothing whatsoever like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing"''' (Qur'an 42:11)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=htx8BAAAQBAJ|title=The Archetypal Sunni Scholar: Law, Theology, and Mysticism in the Synthesis of al-Bajuri|last=Spevack|first=Aaron|date=2014-09-09|publisher=SUNY Press|year=|isbn=9781438453712|location=|pages=129–130|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tafsir al-Qur'an al-Azim|last=Ibn Kathir|first=Ismail|publisher=Maktabat Awlad al-Shaykh l'il Turath|year=2000|location=Cairo|pages=6:320}}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The precise nature of ''tafwid'' has been subject to debate among Muslim scholars.&lt;ref name=Lauziere&gt;{{Cite book|first=Henri |last=Lauzière | year=2015 | title=The Making of Salafism: Islamic Reform in the Twentieth Century|publisher=Columbia University Press (Kindle edition)|page=6048 (Kindle location)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The followers of [[Ibn Taymiyya]], including contemporary [[Salafi]]s, hold that only the modality of the attributes should be consigned to God (''tafwid al-kayfiyya''), while the literal sense of the attributes should be accepted according to their lexical meaning in the Arabic language.&lt;ref name=Lauziere/&gt; Thus they argue that the ''salaf'' accepted that God has a hand, because the meaning of the word "hand" (''yad'') was known, but without assuming that God's hand is comparable to a human hand, or asking how or why that is.&lt;ref name=Lauziere/&gt; In contrast, anti-Salafi scholars reject this distinction and accept ''tafwid'' without qualification.&lt;ref name=Lauziere/&gt;

== Divorce==

In Islamic personal status law, ''tafwid'' refers to a sub-type of divorce (''talaq al-tafwid'' or ''tafwid al-talaq'') in which the power of ''[[Divorce in Islam|talaq]]'' (the type of divorce normally initiated by the husband) is delegated to the wife. This delegation can be made at the time of drawing up the marriage contract or during the marriage, with or without conditions.&lt;ref name=ODOI/&gt; Classical jurists differed as to the validity of different forms of delegation.&lt;ref name=ODOI/&gt; Most modern Muslim-majority countries permit this type of divorce in some form.&lt;ref name=ODOI/&gt;

== Other uses==

The term ''tafwid'' has also been used in law with various other meanings related to delegation of power, authorization of an act, or issuance of a warrant for arrest.&lt;ref name=ODOI/&gt;

'''Theodric Romeyn Beck''' (April 11, 1791 – November 19, 1855), alternatively '''Theodoric Romeyn Beck''' or '''T. Romeyn Beck''', was an [[United States|American]] physician in [[Albany, NY|Albany]], [[New York (state)|New York]] specializing in [[medical jurisprudence]] who authored the first significant American book on [[forensic medicine]], ''Elements of Medical Jurisprudence'' in 1823.

==Biography==
Beck was born in [[Schenectady, New York]], to the family of Caleb Beck of English descent. He graduated from [[Union College]] at the age of 16 and the [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]] with an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] at the age of 20 before going into practice in [[Albany, NY|Albany]] in 1811.  In 1813 he presented to the Albany Society of Arts a comprehensive paper on the mineral resources of the United States.  In 1815 he was appointed professor of the institutes of medicine, and lecturer on medical jurisprudence in the [[Fairfield Academy|College of Physicians and Surgeons of Western New York]], at [[Fairfield, New York|Fairfield]]. Blake was also elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlist American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;  He served as the [[Principal (school)|Principal]] of [[The Albany Academy]] from 1817 to 1848, where he encouraged the future curator of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[Joseph Henry]], to enroll as a student and later serve as a professor of mathematics and [[natural philosophy]] in 1826.  Also during this time, he was a professor of medical jurisprudence at Fairfield Medical College from 1826 until 1836, and professor of [[materia medica]] in that institution from 1836 till 1840, and at [[Albany Medical College]] from 1840 until 1854.

[[File:Elements of Medical Jurisprudence.jpg|thumb|left|''Elements of Medical Jurisprudence'']] In 1823, while secretary of the Society for the Promotion of Useful Arts (SPUA), he founded the Albany Lyceum of Natural History, which  focused on the preservation of mineral and botanical specimens collected in New York State surveys.  The following year, SPUA and the Albany Lyceum of Natural History merged to form the Albany Institute; [[Stephen Van Rensselaer III]] was appointed its President and Beck was appointed its Vice President.   He was chosen [[President]] of the New York State Medical Society in 1829, and became a manager of the state [[lunatic asylum]] before becoming President of the Board of Managers in 1854.  During his service, he collected statistics on deaf-mutes, which influenced the legislature to pass laws for the education of the [[mentally ill]].  In addition, from 1849 to 1853 he edited the ''American Journal of Insanity''.

His principal work was ''Elements of Medical Jurisprudence''. His brother [[John Brodhead Beck]], also a physician, contributed the material on infanticide.  The first edition was printed in 1823, a seventh edition was issued in [[London]] in 1842, with notes by Dunlap and Darwell, and a tenth in [[Albany, NY|Albany]] in 1850.

Beck also contributed to numerous scientific journals.  Another of his brothers, [[Lewis Caleb Beck]], wrote a noted book on the ''Mineralogy of New York'' (1842).

==Early developments==
[[File:Thales Lebiedzki Rahl.jpg|thumb|Detail of the right-hand facade fresco, showing [[Thales of Miletus]], [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens]].]]

* 28th century BC &amp;mdash; [[Ancient Egypt]]ian texts describe [[electric fish]]. They refer to them as the "Thunderer of the [[Nile]]", and described them as the "protectors" of all other fish.&lt;ref name="moller"&gt;{{citation|title=Review: Electric Fish|first=Peter|last=Moller|journal=BioScience|volume=41|issue=11|date=December 1991|pages=794–6 [794]|doi=10.2307/1311732|jstor=1311732|last2=Kramer|first2=Bernd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 6th century BC &amp;mdash; [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] philosopher [[Thales of Miletus]] observes that rubbing fur on various substances, such as [[amber]], would cause an attraction between the two, which is now known to be caused by [[static electricity]]. He noted that the amber buttons could attract light objects such as hair and that if the amber was rubbed sufficiently a spark would jump.
* 424 BC [[Aristophanes]] "lens" is a glass globe filled with water.([[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] says that it can be used to read letters ''no matter how small or dim'')&lt;ref name=King&gt;''The history of the telescope'' by Henry C.

* 4th century BC [[Mozi|Mo Di]] first mentions the [[camera obscura]], a pin-hole camera.
* 3rd century BC [[Euclid]] is the first to write about reflection and refraction and notes that light travels in straight lines&lt;ref name=King/&gt;
* 3rd century BC &amp;mdash; The [[Baghdad Battery]] is dated from this period. It resembles a [[galvanic cell]] and is believed by some to have been used for [[electroplating]], although there is no common consensus on the purpose of these devices nor whether they were, indeed, even electrical in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2804257.stm |first=Arran |last=Frood  |title=Riddle of 'Baghdad's batteries' |newspaper=BBC News |date=27 February 2003 |accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1st century BC &amp;mdash; Pliny in his Natural History records the story of a shepherd Magnes who discovered the magnetic properties of some iron stones, "''it is said, made this discovery, when, upon taking his herds to pasture, he found that the nails of his shoes and the iron ferrel of his staff adhered to the ground.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:1.dedication |author=Pliny the Elder |title=The Natural History |chapter=Dedication|series=Perseus Collection: Greek and Roman Materials|publisher=Department of the Classics, Tufts University |accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 130 AD. &amp;mdash; [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemy]] (in his work ''Optics'') wrote about the properties of [[light]] including: [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]], and [[color]] and tabulated [[angle]]s of [[refraction]] for several media
* 8th century AD &amp;mdash; Electric fish are reported by [[Islamic geography|Arabic naturalists]] and [[Islamic medicine|physicians]].&lt;ref name="moller"/&gt;
* 1021 &amp;mdash; [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) writes the ''[[Book of Optics]]'', studying  [[Visual perception|vision]].
* 1088 &amp;mdash; [[Shen Kuo]] first recognizes [[magnetic declination]].
* 1187 &amp;mdash; [[Alexander Neckham]] is first in Europe to describe the magnetic compass and its use in navigation.
* 1269 &amp;mdash; [[Pierre de Maricourt]] describes [[magnet|magnetic pole]]s and remarks on the nonexistence of [[Magnetic monopole|isolated magnetic poles]]
* 1305 &amp;mdash; [[Dietrich von Freiberg]] uses crystalline spheres and flasks filled with water to study the [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and refraction in raindrops that leads to primary and secondary [[rainbow]]s
* 14th century AD &amp;mdash; Possibly the earliest and nearest approach to the discovery of the identity of [[lightning]], and [[electricity]] from any other source, is to be attributed to the [[Arabs]], who before the 15th century had the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for lightning (''raad'') applied to the [[electric ray]].&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana"&gt;''The [[Encyclopedia Americana]]; a library of universal knowledge'' (1918), [[New York City|New York]]: Encyclopedia Americana Corp.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1550 &amp;mdash; [[Gerolamo Cardano]] writes about electricity in ''De Subtilitate'' distinguishing, perhaps for the first time, between electrical and magnetic forces.

==17th century==
* 1600 &amp;mdash; [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] publishes ''De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure'' ("On the Magnet and Magnetic bodies, and on that Great Magnet the Earth"), Europe's then current standard on electricity and magnetism. He experimented with and noted the different character of electrical and magnetic forces. In addition to known ancient Greeks' observations of the electrical properties of rubbed amber, he experimented with a needle balanced on a pivot, and found that the needle was non-directionally affected by many materials such as alum, arsenic, hard resin, [[Jet (lignite)|jet]], glass, gum-mastic, mica, rock-salt, sealing wax, slags, sulfur, and precious stones such as amethyst, [[beryl]], diamond, opal, and sapphire. He noted that electrical charge could be stored by covering the body with a non-conducting substance such as silk. He described the method of artificially magnetizing iron. His [[terrella]] (little earth), a sphere cut from a lodestone on a metal lathe, modeled the earth as a lodestone (magnetic iron ore) and demonstrated that every lodestone has fixed poles, and how to find them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Henry Smith |last=Williams |title=A history of science |volume=2 |url=http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/sci/history/AHistoryofScienceVolumeII/chap18.html |chapter=Part IV.

He experimented with such physical models in an attempt to explain problems in [[navigation]] due varying properties of the [[magnetic compass]] with respect to their location on the earth, such as [[magnetic declination]] and magnetic inclination. His experiments explained the [[Dip circle|dipping of the needle]] by the magnetic attraction of the earth, and were used to predict where the vertical dip would be found. Such magnetic inclination was described as early as the 11th century by [[Shen Kuo]] in his ''Meng Xi Bi Tan'' and further investigated in 1581 by retired mariner and [[Compasssmith|compass maker]] [[Robert Norman]], as described in his pamphlet, ''The Newe Attractive.'' The gilbert, a unit of [[magnetomotive force]] or [[magnetic potential]], was named in his honor.

* 1732 &amp;mdash; [[C. F. du Fay]] Shows that all objects, except metals, animals, and liquids, can be electrified by rubbing them and that metals, animals and liquids could be electrified by means of an electrostatic generators
* 1734 &amp;mdash; [[C. F. du Fay|Charles François de Cisternay DuFay]] (inspired by Gray's work to perform electrical experiments) dispels the effluvia theory by his paper in Volume 38 of the ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society,'' describing his discovery of the distinction between two kinds of electricity: "resinous," produced by rubbing bodies such as amber, copal, or [[Lac|gum-lac]] with silk or paper, and "vitreous," by rubbing bodies as glass, rock crystal, or precious stones with hair or wool. He also posited the principle of mutual attraction for unlike forms and the repelling of like forms and that "from this principle one may with ease deduce the explanation of a great number of other phenomena." The terms resinous and vitreous were later replaced with the terms "positive" and "negative" by [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]] and Benjamin Franklin.
* 1737 &amp;mdash; [[C. F. du Fay]] and [[Francis Hauksbee the younger]]{{fact|date=May 2013}} independently discover two kinds of frictional electricity: one generated from rubbing glass, the other from rubbing resin (later identified as positive and negative electrical charges).
* 1740 &amp;mdash; [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], in ''Mémoire sur la réfraction des corps solides'', explains the process of [[refraction]].
* 1745 &amp;mdash; [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]] of Leiden (Leyden) independently discovers the [[Leyden jar|Leyden (Leiden) jar]], a primitive [[capacitor]] or "condenser" (term coined by Volta in 1782, derived from the Italian ''condensatore''), with which the transient electrical energy generated by current friction machines could now be stored. He and his student Andreas Cunaeus used a glass jar filled with water into which a brass rod had been placed. He charged the jar by touching a wire leading from the electrical machine with one hand while holding the outside of the jar with the other. The energy could be discharged by completing an external circuit between the brass rod and another conductor, originally his hand, placed in contact with the outside of the jar. He also found that if the jar were placed on a piece of metal on a table, a shock would be received by touching this piece of metal with one hand and touching the wire connected to the electrical machine with the other.
* 1745 &amp;mdash; [[Ewald Georg von Kleist]] of independently invents the capacitor: a glass jar coated inside and out with metal. The inner coating was connected to a rod that passed through the lid and ended in a metal sphere. By having this thin layer of glass insulation (a [[dielectric]]) between two large, closely spaced plates, von Kleist found the energy density could be increased dramatically compared with the situation with no insulator. [[Daniel Gralath]] improved the design and was also the first to combine several jars to form a battery strong enough to kill birds and small animals upon discharge.
* 1746 &amp;mdash; [[Leonhard Euler]] develops the wave theory of light refraction and dispersion
* 1747 &amp;mdash; [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]], while experimenting with a Leyden jar, observes that a discharge of static electricity causes [[electric current]] to flow and develops the concept of an electrical potential ([[voltage]]).
* 1752 &amp;mdash; [[Benjamin Franklin]] establishes the link between lightning and electricity by the flying a kite into a thunderstorm and transferring some of the charge into a Leyden jar and showed that its properties were the same as charge produced by an electrical machine. He is credited with utilizing the concepts of positive and negative charge in the explanation of then known electrical phenomenon. He theorized that there was an electrical fluid (which he proposed could be the [[Luminiferous ether#The history of light and aether|luminiferous ether]], which was used by others before and after him, to explain the [[Light#Wave_theor|wave theory of light]]) that was part of all material and all intervening space. The charge of any object would be neutral if the concentration of this fluid were the same both inside and outside of the body, positive if the object contained an excess of this fluid, and negative if there were a deficit. In 1749 he had documented the similar properties of lightning and electricity, such as that both an [[electric spark]] and a lightning flash produced [[light]] and sound, could kill animals, cause fires, melt metal, destroy or reverse the polarity of magnetism, and flowed through conductors and could be concentrated at sharp points. He was later able to apply the property of concentrating at sharp points by his invention of the lightning rod, for which he intentionally did not profit. He also investigated the Leyden jar, proving that the charge was stored on the glass and not in the water, as others had assumed.
* 1753 &amp;mdash; C. M. (of Scotland, possibly Charles Morrison, of Greenock or Charles Marshall, of Aberdeen)  proposes in the 17 February edition of Scots Magazine, an electrostatic telegraph system with 26 insulated wires, each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet and each connected to electrostatic machines. The receiving charged end was to electrostatically attract a disc of paper marked with the corresponding letter.

* 1791 &amp;mdash; [[Luigi Galvani]] discovers galvanic electricity and [[bioelectricity]] through experiments following an observation that touching exposed muscles in frogs' legs with a scalpel which had been close to a static electrical machine caused them to jump. He called this "animal electricity". Years of experimentation in the 1780s eventually led him to the construction of an arc of two different metals (copper and zinc for example) by connecting the two metal pieces and then connecting their open ends across the nerve of a frog leg, producing the same muscular contractions (by completing a circuit) as originally accidentally observed. The use of different metals to produce an electrical spark is the basis that led Alessandro Volta in 1799 to his invention of his voltaic pile, which eventually became the [[Battery (electricity)|galvanic battery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Henry Smith |last=Williams |title=A history of science |volume=3|url=http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/sci/history/AHistoryofScienceVolumeIII/chap46.html |chapter=VII.

* 1799 &amp;mdash; [[Alessandro Volta]], following Galvani's discovery of galvanic electricity, creates a [[voltaic pile|voltaic cell]] producing an electric current by the chemical action of several pairs of alternating copper (or silver) and zinc discs "piled" and separated by cloth or cardboard which had been soaked brine (salt water) or acid to increase conductivity. In '''1800''' he demonstrates the production of light from a glowing wire conducting electricity. This was followed in 1801 by his construction of the first [[electric battery]], by utilizing multiple voltaic cells. Prior to his major discoveries, in a letter of praise to the Royal Society 1793, Volta reported Luigi Galvani's experiments of the 1780s as the "most beautiful and important discoveries," regarding them as the foundation of future discoveries. Volta's inventions led to revolutionary changes with this method of the production of inexpensive, controlled electric current vs. existing frictional machines and Leyden jars. The electric battery became standard equipment in every experimental laboratory and heralded an age of practical applications of electricity.&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} The unit [[volt]] is named for his contributions.

* 1820 &amp;mdash; [[Hans Christian Ørsted]], Danish physicist and chemist, unites the separate sciences of electricity and magnetism. He develops an experiment in which he notices a compass needle is deflected from [[Magnetic declination|magnetic north]] when an electric current from the battery he was using was switched on and off, convincing him that magnetic fields radiate from all sides of a live wire just as light and heat do, confirming a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. He also observes that the movement of the compass-needle to one side or the other depends upon the direction of the current. Following intensive investigations, he published his findings, proving that a changing electric current produces a magnetic field as it flows through a wire. The [[oersted]] unit of magnetic induction is named for his contributions.
* 1820 &amp;mdash; [[André-Marie Ampère]], professor of mathematics at the Ecole Polytechnique, a short time after learning of Ørsted's discovery that a magnetic needle is acted on by a voltaic current, conducts experiments and publishes a paper in ''[[Annales de Chimie et de Physique]]'' attempting to give a combined theory of electricity and magnetism. He shows that a coil of wire carrying a current behaves like an ordinary magnet and suggests that electromagnetism might be used in telegraphy. He mathematically develops [[Ampère's force law|Ampère's law]] describing the magnetic force between two electric currents. His mathematical theory explains known electromagnetic phenomena and predicts new ones. His laws of electrodynamics include the facts that parallel conductors currying current in the same direction attract and those carrying currents in the opposite directions repel one another. One of the first to develop electrical measuring techniques, he built an instrument utilizing a free-moving needle to measure the flow of electricity, contributing to the development of the [[galvanometer]]. In '''1821''', he proposed a telegraphy system utilizing one wire per "galvanometer" to indicate each letter, and reported experimenting successfully with such a system. However, in '''1824''', [[Peter Barlow (mathematician)|Peter Barlow]] reported its maximum distance was only 200 feet, and so was impractical.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In '''1826''' he publishes the ''Memoir on the Mathematical Theory of Electrodynamic Phenomena, Uniquely Deduced from Experience'' containing a mathematical derivation of the electrodynamic force law. Following Faraday's discovery of  electromagnetic induction in 1831, Ampère agreed that Faraday deserved full credit for the discovery.
* 1820 &amp;mdash; [[Johann Salomo Christoph Schweigger]], German chemist, physicist, and professor, builds the first sensitive galvanometer, wrapping a coil of wire around a graduated compass, an acceptable instrument for actual measurement as well as detection of small amounts of electric current, naming it after Luigi Galvani.

* 1825 &amp;mdash; [[Augustin Fresnel]] phenomenologically explains optical activity by introducing circular birefringence
* 1825 &amp;mdash; [[William Sturgeon]], founder of the first English Electric Journal, ''Annals of Electricity'', found that an iron core inside a helical coil of wire connected to a battery greatly increased the resulting magnetic field, thus making possible the more powerful [[electromagnet]]s utilizing a [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] core. Sturgeon also bent the iron core into a U-shape to bring the poles closer together, thus concentrating the magnetic field lines. These discoveries followed Ampère's discovery that electricity passing through a coiled wire produced a magnetic force and that of [[François Arago|Dominique François Jean Arago]] finding that an iron bar is magnetized by putting it inside the coil of current-carrying wire, but Arago had not observed the increased strength of the resulting field while the bar was being magnetized.
* 1826 &amp;mdash; [[Georg Simon Ohm]] states his [[Ohm's law]] of [[electrical resistance]] in the journals of Schweigger and Poggendorff, and also published in his landmark pamphlet ''Die galvanische Kette mathematisch bearbeitet'' in '''1827'''. The unit [[ohm (unit)|ohm]] (Ω) of electrical resistance has been named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juliantrubin.com/bigten/ohmlawexperiments.html |title=Georg Simon Ohm: The Discovery of Ohm's Law |publisher=Juliantrubin.com |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1829 &amp; 1830 &amp;mdash; [[Francesco Zantedeschi]] publishes papers on the production of electric currents in closed circuits by the approach and withdrawal of a magnet, thereby anticipating Michael Faraday's classical experiments of 1831.
* 1831 &amp;mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] began experiments leading to his discovery of the law of [[electromagnetic induction]], though the discovery may have been anticipated by the work of Francesco Zantedeschi. His breakthrough came when he wrapped two insulated coils of wire around a massive iron ring, bolted to a chair, and found that upon passing a current through one coil, a momentary electric current was induced in the other coil. He then found that if he moved a magnet through a loop of wire, or vice versa, an electric current also flowed in the wire. He then used this principle to construct the [[Dynamo|electric dynamo]], the first electric power generator. He proposed that electromagnetic forces extended into the empty space around the conductor, but did not complete that work. Faraday's concept of lines of flux emanating from charged bodies and magnets provided a way to visualize electric and magnetic fields. That mental model was crucial to the successful development of electromechanical devices which were to dominate the 19th century. His demonstrations that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field,  mathematically modeled by [[Faraday's law of induction]], would subsequently become one of [[Maxwell's equations]]. These consequently evolved into the generalization of [[Field (physics)|field theory]].
* 1831 &amp;mdash; [[Macedonio Melloni]] uses a [[thermopile]] to detect infrared radiation
* 1832 &amp;mdash; [[Pavel Schilling|Baron Pavel L'vovitch Schilling]] (Paul Schilling) creates the first electromagnetic telegraph, consisting of a single-needle system in which a code was used to indicate the characters. Only months later, Göttingen professors [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] constructed a telegraph that was working two years before Schilling could put his into practice. Schilling demonstrated the long-distance transmission of signals between two different rooms of his apartment and was the first to put into practice a binary system of signal transmission.
* 1833 &amp;mdash; [[Heinrich Lenz]] states [[Lenz's law]]: if an increasing (or decreasing) magnetic flux induces an [[Electromotive force|electromotive force (EMF)]], the resulting current will oppose a further increase (or decrease) in magnetic flux, i.e., that an induced current in a closed conducting loop will appear in such a direction that it opposes the change that produced it. Lenz's law is one consequence of the principle of [[conservation of energy]]. If a magnet moves towards a closed loop, then the induced current in the loop creates a field that exerts a force opposing the motion of the magnet. Lenz's law can be derived from [[Faraday's law of induction]] by noting the negative sign on the right side of the equation. He also independently discovered [[Joule's first law|Joule's law]] in '''1842'''; to honor his efforts, Russian physicists refer to it as the "Joule-Lenz law."
* 1833 &amp;mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] announces his law of [[Electrochemical_equivalent#Electrochemical_equivalents|electrochemical equivalents]]
* 1834 &amp;mdash; [[Heinrich Lenz]] determines the direction of the induced [[electromotive force]] (emf) and [[Electric current|current]] resulting from [[electromagnetic induction]]. [[Lenz's law]] provides a physical interpretation of the choice of sign in [[Faraday's law of induction]] (1831), indicating that the induced emf and the change in flux have opposite signs.
* 1834 &amp;mdash; [[Jean-Charles Peltier]] discovers the [[Peltier effect]]: heating by an electric current at the junction of two different metals.
* 1835 &amp;mdash; [[Joseph Henry]] invents the [[relay|electric relay]], which is an electrical switch by which the change of a weak current through the windings of an electromagnet will attract an armature to open or close the switch. Because this can control (by opening or closing) another, much higher-power, circuit, it is in a broad sense a form of electrical amplifier. This made a practical electric telegraph possible. He was the first to coil insulated wire tightly around an iron core in order to make an extremely powerful electromagnet, improving on William Sturgeon’s design, which used loosely coiled, uninsulated wire. He also discovered the property of [[self inductance]] independently of Michael Faraday.

* 1836 &amp;mdash; [[David Alter|Dr. David Alter]] invents and demonstrates to witnesses the first American electric telegraph in Elderton, Pennsylvania. In a later interview in the book, ''Biographical and Historical Cyclopedia of Indiana and Armstrong Counties'' he states: "I may say that there is no connection at all between the telegraph of Morse and others and that of myself...Professor Morse most probably never heard of me or my Elderton telegraph." In '''1840''' he invents an electric buggy, forerunner of the automobile. His inventions also include an electric clock and a short-range type of telephone, forerunner to Alexander Graham Bell's telephone. He is also credited with the origins of Spectrum Analysis by his idea that every element has its own emission spectrum, and an expansion of spectrum analysis to include the optical properties of gases.
* 1837 &amp;mdash; [[Samuel Morse]] develops an alternative electrical telegraph design capable of transmitting long distances over poor quality wire. He and his assistant [[Alfred Vail]] develop the [[Morse code]] signaling alphabet. In '''1838''' Morse successfully tested the device at the Speedwell Ironworks near [[Morristown, New Jersey]], and publicly demonstrated it to a scientific committee at the [[Franklin Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. The first electric telegram using this device was sent by Morse on 24 May, '''1844''' from Baltimore to Washington, D.C., bearing the message "[[Book of Numbers|What hath God wrought]]?"

* 1865 &amp;mdash; [[James Clerk Maxwell]] publishes his landmark paper [[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]], in which [[Maxwell's equations]] demonstrated that electric and [[magnetism|magnetic]] forces are two complementary aspects of [[electromagnetism]]. He shows that the associated complementary electric and magnetic fields of electromagnetism travel through space, in the form of waves, at a constant velocity of 3.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m/s. He also proposes that light is a form of electromagnetic radiation and that waves of oscillating electric and magnetic fields travel through empty space at a speed that could be predicted from simple electrical experiments. Using available data, he obtains a velocity of 310,740,000&amp;nbsp;m/s and states "This velocity is so nearly that of light, that it seems we have strong reason to conclude that light itself (including radiant heat, and other [[radiation]]s if any) is an electromagnetic disturbance in the form of waves propagated through the electromagnetic field according to electromagnetic laws."

[[File:Transposing instrument- written sounds as.png|thumb|The [[Soprano clarinet|B{{music|flat}} clarinet]] is a transposing instrument. When the note C occurs in a score that is especially written for a B{{music|flat}} clarinet (''top''), the instrument will actually sound a B{{music|flat}} (''bottom''), hence the name of the instrument. The very same fingering when played on an [[Soprano clarinet|A clarinet]] will sound an A, and in a score for A clarinet, an A will be written as a C.]]

A '''transposing instrument''' is a [[musical instrument]] whose music is recorded in [[sheet music|staff notation]] at a [[pitch (music)|pitch]] different from the pitch that actually sounds ([[concert pitch]]). A written [[middle C]] on a transposing instrument produces a pitch other than middle C, and that pitch identifies the [[interval (music)|interval]] of transposition when describing the instrument. For example, a written C on a B{{music|flat}} [[clarinet]] sounds a concert B{{music|flat}}.

Rather than a property of the instrument, the [[transposition (music)|transposition]] is a convention of [[musical notation]]. Instruments whose music is typically notated in this way are called transposing instruments. As transposing instruments is a notation convention, the issue of transposition is mainly an issue for genres of music which use [[sheet music]], such as [[classical music]] and [[jazz]] (while jazz is an [[jazz improvisation|improvisation]]-based type of music, professional players are still expected to be able to read [[lead sheet]]s and [[big band]] sheet music). For some instruments (e.g., the [[piccolo]] or the [[double bass]]), the sounding pitch is still a C, but in a different [[octave]]; these instruments are said to transpose "at the octave".

== Reasons for transposing ==
=== Ease of switching instruments ===
Many instruments are members of a [[family (musical instruments)|family of instruments]] that differ mainly in size (see examples below). The instruments in these families have differing [[Range (music)|range]]s, with the members sounding lower as they get larger; but an identical pattern of [[Fingering (music)|fingering]]s on two instruments in the same family produces pitches a fixed interval apart. For example, the fingerings which produce the notes of a C major scale on a standard [[Western concert flute|flute]], a non-transposing instrument, produce a G major scale on an [[alto flute]]. As a result, these instruments' parts are notated so that the written notes are fingered the same way on each instrument, making it easier for a single instrumentalist to play several instruments in the same family.

Instruments that transpose this way are often referred to as being in a certain "key", such as the "A clarinet" or "clarinet in A". The instrument's key tells which pitch will sound when the player plays a note written as ''C''. A player of a B{{music|flat}} clarinet who reads a written C will sound a B{{music|flat}} while the player of an A clarinet will read the same note and sound an A. The non-transposing member of the family is thus called a "clarinet in C".

Examples of families of transposing instruments:
* [[cornet]]s
* [[saxhorn]]s

Examples of families of non-transposing instruments:
* [[trombone]]s&lt;ref name=Apel&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor=[[Willi Apel]]|title=Transposing Instruments|encyclopedia=[[Harvard Dictionary of Music]]|edition=second|year=1972|page=860|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-37501-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[tuba]]s&lt;ref name=Apel /&gt;

Recorders are either untransposed or in some cases transposed at the octave. In the early 20th century, however, instruments with basic scales other than C were sometimes written as transposing instruments.

Examples of families with both transposing and non-transposing instruments:
* [[clarinet]]s
* [[flute]]s
* [[oboe]]s
* [[saxophone]]s
* [[trumpet]]s
The [[euphonium]], with its close relative the [[baritone horn]], may be played as either a [[treble clef]] instrument or a [[bass clef]] instrument because it is often played as a second instrument: trumpet or cornet players who [[doubling (disambiguation#Music|double]] on the euphonium are used to playing in treble clef, while trombone or tuba players who double on the euphonium are used to playing in bass clef. In both cases, the instrument plays in the same range as the trombone, i.e., it produces the same pitches. However, in treble clef, the euphonium is a transposing instrument, i.e., its music and fingering are set up as if it is a B{{music|flat}} instrument (transposing), while in bass clef, its music and fingering assume that it is a C instrument (non-transposing). Musicians who play both bass- and treble-clef euphonium must learn to use different fingerings for the written notes: e.g., a B{{music|flat}} in treble clef requires that the first valve be depressed, whereas a B{{music|flat}} in bass clef is open. 

===Horn crooks===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
Before valves were invented in the 19th century, [[Horn (instrument)|horns]] and [[Natural trumpet|trumpets]] could play only the notes of the [[harmonic series (music)|overtone series]] from a single [[fundamental frequency|fundamental]] pitch. (Exceptions included [[Slide (wind instrument)|slide-bearing]] versions such as the [[sackbut]] and finger-hole horns like the [[cornett]] and [[Serpent (instrument)|serpent]].) Beginning in the early 18th century, a system of [[crook (music)|crooks]] was devised in Germany, enabling this fundamental to be changed by inserting one of a set of crooks between the mouthpiece and the lead pipe of the instrument, increasing the total length of its sounding tube. As a result, all horn music was written as if for a fundamental pitch of C, but the crooks could make a single instrument a transposing instrument into almost any key. 

Changing these lead-pipe crooks was time-consuming, and even keeping them from falling out while playing was a matter of some concern to the player, so changing crooks could take place only during substantial rests. Medial crooks, inserted in the central portion of the instrument, were an improvement devised in the middle of the 18th century, and they could also be made to function as a slide for tuning, or to change the pitch of the fundamental by a semitone or tone. The introduction of valves made this process unnecessary, though many players and composers found the tone quality of valved instruments inferior ([[Richard Wagner]] sometimes wrote horn parts for both natural and valved horns together in the same piece). F transposition became standard in the early 19th century, with the horn sounding a perfect fifth below written pitch in treble clef. In bass clef, composers differed in whether they expected the instruments to transpose down a fifth or up a fourth.

=== Reconciling pitch standards ===

In the music of Germany during the Baroque period, and notably in the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], instruments used for different purposes were often tuned to different pitch standards, called ''Chorton'' ("choir pitch") and ''Kammerton'' ("chamber [music] pitch"). When they played together in an ensemble, the parts of some instruments would then have to be transposed to compensate. In many of Bach's cantatas the organ part{{clarify|reason=Any source calls an organ tuned to a different pitch standard whose part is transposed to compensate the pitch difference a *transposing instrument*? The subject of this article is *Transposing instrument* and not Miscellaneous uses of transposition|date=February 2014}} is notated a full step lower than the other instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Laurence Dreyfus]]|title=Bach's Continuo Group|year=1987|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-06030-X|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Concert pitch#Pitch inflation|pitch inflation]].

A few early-music ensembles of the present day must do something similar if they comprise some instruments tuned to A415 and others to [[A440 (pitch standard)|A440]], approximately a [[semitone]] apart. Modern builders of continuo instruments sometimes include [[Organ console#Keyboards|moveable keyboards]] which can play with either pitch standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpschd.nu/tech/kb/trans.html|title=CBH Global Harpsichord Technology|author=Carey Beebe Harpsichords Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The harpsichord has a single string for each note, plucked by a plectrum and the difference in pitch between the Baroque A at 415&amp;nbsp;Hz and the "modern" A at 440&amp;nbsp;Hz is one half step. Moving the keyboard mechanism right or left causes the A key to play the next string, namely the A{{music|#}} at 440&amp;nbsp;Hz or the A{{music|b}} at 392&amp;nbsp;Hz respectively. Movement of the keyboard allows one to play higher or lower, though the topmost or bottommost key will not produce sound unless the builder has provided extra strings to accommodate the transposition feature.

== Transposition at the octave ==
{{See also|Clef#Octave clefs}}
If an instrument has a range too high or too low for composers to easily write its music on bass or treble clef, the music may be written either an [[octave]] higher or an octave lower than it sounds, in order to reduce the use of [[ledger line]]s. Instruments that "transpose at the octave" are not playing in a different [[key (music)|key]] from concert pitch instruments, but sound an octave higher or lower than written. Music for the [[double bass]] is written an octave higher than it sounds. Thus, when cellos and basses are reading exactly the same part (a common practice by composers from the early Classical period), the basses' bassline is an octave below the cellos'.

Most authorities include this type of notation under the umbrella "transposing instruments",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=[[Harvard Dictionary of Music]]|edition=second|editor=[[Willi Apel]]|year=1972|contribution=Transposing Instruments}}. According to this article, if an octave-transposing clef is used (with a little 8 above or below, the term "transposition" does not apply.&lt;/ref&gt; although it's different from the way the term [[transposition (music)|transposing]] is used in other musical contexts.

== Mechanical and physical considerations ==
Most [[woodwind instrument]]s have one major scale whose execution involves lifting the fingers more or less sequentially from the bottom to top. This scale is usually the one notated as a C scale (from C to C, with no sharps or flats) for that instrument. The note written as C sounds as the note of the instrument's transposition: on an E{{music|flat}} alto saxophone, that note sounds as a concert E{{music|flat}}, while on an A clarinet, that note sounds as a concert A. Clarinets are one exception, in that they actually have two different scales in the first and second registers, nominally an F scale and a C scale, but treated by the performer as sounding "at pitch" for a C clarinet. The [[bassoon]] is another exception; it is not a transposing instrument, yet its "home" scale is F (like the low register of the C clarinet).{{dubious|date=November 2016}}

[[Brass instruments]], when played with no valves engaged (or, for [[trombone]]s, with the slide all the way in), play a series of notes that form the overtone series based on some fundamental pitch, e.g., the B{{music|flat}} [[trumpet]], when played with no valves engaged, can play the overtones based on B{{music|flat}}. Usually, that pitch is the note that indicates the transposition of that brass instrument. Trombones are an exception: they read at concert pitch, although tenor and bass trombones are pitched in B{{music|flat}}, alto trombone in E{{music|flat}}. Double horns are another exception, in that they combine two different sets of tubing into a single instrument, most characteristically in F and B{{Music|flat}}. The horn part is nevertheless transposed uniformly in F (and indeed seldom if ever specifies whether a double or single horn is to be used), with the player deciding when to switch from one side of the instrument to the other. Single B{{Music|flat}} horns also normally read from parts transposed in F.

In general, for these instruments there is some reason to consider a certain pitch the "home" note of an instrument, and that pitch is usually written as C for that instrument. The concert pitch of that note is what determines how we refer to the transposition of that instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwerden.com/eu-articles-bareuph.cfm |title=Baritone or Euphonium? |publisher=Dwerden.com |date=2017-07-20 |accessdate=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conductor's score==
In [[conducting|conductor]]s' scores and other [[full score]]s, music for transposing instruments is generally written in transposed form, just as in the players' parts. Some composers from the beginning of the 20th century onward have written orchestral scores entirely in concert pitch, e.g. the score of [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Prokofiev)|Piano Concerto No. 1]] in D{{music|b}}.

Transposing instruments' names almost always use flats instead of sharps (thus there are instruments in E{{flat}} or in B{{flat}}, but these are never today{{Clarify|date=September 2016}}&lt;!--Was this done in the past?--&gt; called instruments in D{{sharp}} or in A{{sharp}}). In practice the actual transposition in the score may (for the convenience of the player) depend on the key of the music. For example, in a section in C major an E{{flat}} alto saxophone part will appear in A major (three sharps). But in a section in concert B major it would be impractical to notate the sax part in G{{sharp}} major part (a key with eight sharps, i.e. six sharps and one double-sharp). Instead, their part would appear in A{{flat}} major (four flats), just as if they were playing a D{{sharp}} instrument.
