'''Anahit Tsitsikian''' ({{lang-hy|Անահիտ Ցիցիկյան}}; born [[Leningrad]], August 26, 1926; death [[Yerevan]], May 2, 1999) was the first renowned [[Armenians|Armenian]] female [[violin]]ist. She toured around the world through more than 100 cities during the [[Armenian SSR|Soviet]] times; she taught at the [[Yerevan State Musical Conservatory|State Conservatory]] for approximately 40 years and wrote more than 300 articles and scenarios for television and radio programs. She was also a scholar who established a new branch of Armenian musicology, history of performing art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armeniaonline.ru/product.php/988 |title=Армянское смычковое искусство Анаит Цицикян |publisher=Armeniaonline.ru |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dedicated the last twenty years of her life to research in the field of [[music history|ancient music history]], becoming the founder of a new branch of Armenian musical archaeology.

Tsitsikian was Merited Artist of Armenia or [[People's Artist of Armenian SSR]] (1967), [[PhD]] of [[Musicology|Musical Science]] (1970) and Professor of Music (1982).

==Bio==
Anahit Tsitsikian was born in Leningrad (currently St. Petersburg), Russia, into a family of an engineer and a doctor. She began playing the violin at the age of six. Her teachers were musician [[Grigory Ginzburg]] and later on professor [[Lev Moiseyevich Zeitlin]] ([[:ru:Цейтлин, Лев Моисеевич|ru]]). At the beginning of World War II, at the age of fifteen, she left Leningrad for Armenia. Her birthplace left an unforgettable mark on her development as a person and musician. She remained an individual with fine tastes and a careful and sincere approach and attitude toward historical legacy; and she was gentle and respectful toward her friends, colleagues and students.{{Tone inline|date=March 2011}}

She studied at the [[Yerevan State Conservatory]] from 1946–1950 as a student of Professor [[Karp Dombayev]]. She was granted the Stalin Scholarship. In 1954 she completed her graduate course at the [[Moscow State Conservatory]] (adviser - Professor [[Konstantin Mostras]]).

She began performing professionally at elementary school age; her performances included many solo performances as well as with symphonic orchestras. Beginning in 1961 she was the principal soloist at the Armenian Philharmonic Hall. Tsitsikian performed throughout the Republics of the former Soviet Union and in 27 countries around the world. As a violinist she produced four vinyl discs under the [[Melodiya]] label. The music of [[modern Armenian composers]] held a special place in Ms. Tsitsikian’s repertoire. She was often the co-author, editor and first interpreter of their original pieces.

She taught at the Yerevan State Conservatory starting in 1950, and she established three new courses in its curriculum: history and theory of bowed instruments, history of Armenian performing arts, and course of music teaching practice.

Tsitsikian started her scholarly research while she was still a student of the Conservatory. Her research focused on bowing art, [[organology]] and [[musical archaeology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naasr.org/index.php/events-site-map-menu-105/past-events-site-map-menu-147/1990-1999-site-map-menu-152 |title=1990-1999 |publisher=Naasr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127065806/http://www.naasr.org/index.php/events-site-map-menu-105/past-events-site-map-menu-147/1990-1999-site-map-menu-152 |archivedate=2015-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of which she was the founder in Armenia. She spoke five languages, and lectured in English, French, and German. She participated in numerous international scientific conferences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/AnahitFoundation#grid/user/E8784E133EA66900 |title=AnahitFoundation |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she also published he articles in Armenia and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kultura-portal.ru/tree_new/cultpaper/article.jsp?number=580&amp;crubric_id=1000178&amp;rubric_id=207&amp;pub_id=650932 |title=п я┐п╩я▄я┌я┐я─п╟ п÷п╬я─я┌п╟п╩: "п░я─п╪я▐п╫я│п╨п╬п╣ я│п╪я▀я┤п╨п╬п╡п╬п╣ п╦я│п╨я┐я│я│я┌п╡п╬" п░п╫п╟п╦я┌ п╕п╦я├п╦п╨я▐п╫ |publisher=Kultura-portal.ru |date=2001-02-22 |accessdate=2015-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716155353/http://www.kultura-portal.ru/tree_new/cultpaper/article.jsp?number=580&amp;crubric_id=1000178&amp;rubric_id=207&amp;pub_id=650932 |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her artistic life, Tsitsikian performed in more than a thousand recitals, recorded sixty pieces of archived music, and authored more than 300 articles and scripts for many radio and television programs. She was a member of many local and international organizations such as: [[Composer’s Union of Armenia]] or [[Union of Soviet Composers]], [[Armenian Theater Union]], [[Journalists Union]], [[Women’s Committee of the USSR]], [[AOKS]] (cultural liaison committee of Armenia with foreign countries), "History of World Culture" Committee in the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union, [[The World Scientific Association of Historical Archaeology]], etc.

Anahit Tsitsikian died on May 2, 1999. The Anahit Cultural Foundation was established in the same year to continue her work and fulfill her dreams. The mission of the foundation is to facilitate the promotion of Armenian music by supporting musicians in their professional education and work, setting up and implementing cultural programs and events, and stimulating the integration of Armenian music within international music.

==Honours and awards==
Anahit Tsitsikian was a [[Merited Artist of Armenia]] (1967), [[PhD of Musical Science]] (1970), and [[Professor of Music]] (1982). In 2004 music school was named after her in Yerevan, Armenia.

In European [[architectural sculpture]], an '''atlas''' (also known as an '''atlant''', or '''atlante'''&lt;ref&gt; Hersey, George,  The Lost Meaning of Classical Architecture,  MIT Press, Cambridge, MA,  1998 p. 129 &lt;/ref&gt;  or '''atlantid'''; plural '''atlantes''')&lt;ref name="atlex"&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Aru.html ''Aru-Az'''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704103828/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Aru.html |date=2008-07-04 }}, Michael Delahunt, [http://www.artlex.com/ ArtLex Art Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424084418/http://www.artlex.com/ |date=2005-04-24 }}, 1996–2008.&lt;/ref&gt; is a support sculpted in the form of a man, which may take the place of a [[column]], a [[Pier (architecture)|pier]] or a [[pilaster]]. The Roman term for such a sculptural support is a telamon (plural '''''telamones''''' or telamons).&lt;ref name="atlex" /&gt;

The term ''atlantes'' is the Greek plural of the name [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]—the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] who was forced to hold the sky on his shoulders for eternity. The alternative term, ''telamones'', also is derived from a later mythological hero, [[Telamon]], one of the [[Argonauts]], who was the father of [[Telamonian Aias|Ajax]]. 

The [[caryatid]] is the female precursor of this architectural form in Greece, a woman standing in the place of each column or pillar. Caryatids are found at the treasuries at [[Delphi]] and the [[Erechtheion]] on the Acropolis at Athens for Athene. They usually are in an [[Ionic order|Ionic context]] and represented a ritual association with the goddesses worshiped within.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Cyril M., ed., ''Illustrated Dictionary of Historic Architecture'', Dover Publications, New York,  1983.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Atalante is typically life-size or larger; smaller similar figures in the decorative arts are called [[Term (architecture)|terms]].  The body of many Atalantes turns into a rectangular pillar or other architectural feature around the waist level, a feature borrowed from the term.  The pose and expression of Alalantes very often show their effort to bear the heavy load of the building, which is rarely the case with terms and caryatids.  The [[herma]] or herm is a classical boundary marker or wayside monument to a god which is usually a square pillar with only a carved head on top, about life-size, and male genitals at the appropriate mid-point. Figures that are rightly called Atalantes may sometimes be described as herms.

Atlantes express extreme effort in their function, heads bent forward to support the weight of the structure above them across their shoulders, forearms often lifted to provide additional support, providing an architectural motif.  Atlantes and caryatids were noted by the Roman late Republican architect [[Vitruvius]], whose description of the structures,&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius, ''De Architectura'', 6.7.6.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than surviving examples, transmitted the idea of atlantes to the Renaissance architectural vocabulary.

==Origin==
Not only did the Caryatids precede them, but similar architectural figures already had been made in [[ancient Egypt]] out of [[monolith]]s. Atlantes originated in Greek Sicily and in [[Magna Graecia]], southern Italy. The [[:Image:Agrigento Telamon.jpg|earliest surviving atlantes]] are fallen ones from the Early Classical [[Greek temple]] of Zeus, the ''Olympeion'', in [[Agrigento]], Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdiva.blogspot.com/2008/05/vitruvius-caryatids-and-telamones.html Dorothy King, "Doric Figured Supports: Vitruvius’ Caryatids and Atlantes: 5.2 Atlantes and Telamones"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Atlantes, however, have played a more significant role in [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] and [[baroque architecture]]. 

During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, many buildings were built with glorious atlantes that look much like the Greek ones. Their selection from the two proposed designs&amp;mdash;the other design using Caryatids&amp;mdash;for the entrance of the [[Hermitage Museum]] that was built for Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] made atlantes become even more fashionable. The portico of this building has ten enormous atlantes, approximately three times life-size, carved from [[Sortavala|Serdobol granite]], which were designed by [[Johann Halbig]] and executed by the sculptor, [[Alexander Terebenev]].

==Mesoamerica==
Similar carved stone columns or pillars in the shape of fierce men at some sites of Pre-Columbian [[Mesoamerica]] are typically called [[Atlantean figures]].  These figures are considered to be "massive statues of [[Toltec]] warriors".&lt;ref name="Evans-p42"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Susan|title=Ancient Mexico and Central America: Archaeology and Culture History|year=2008|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''autoradiograph''' is an image on an [[x-ray]] film or [[nuclear emulsion]] produced by the pattern of decay emissions (e.g., [[beta particles]] or [[gamma rays]]) from a distribution of a [[radioactive]] substance. Alternatively, the autoradiograph is also available as a digital image (digital autoradiography), due to the recent development of [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] gas detectors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barthe N, Coulon P, Hennion C, Ducassou D, Basse-Cathalinat B, Charpak G |title=Optimization of a new scintillation gas detector used to localize electrons emitted by 99mTc |journal=J Nucl Med |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=868–75 |date=May 1999 |pmid=10319763 |url=http://jnm.snmjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10319763}}&lt;/ref&gt; or rare earth phosphorimaging systems.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Life Sciences: [http://mrw.interscience.wiley.com/emrw/9780470015902/els/article/a0002973/current/html Phosphorimager]&lt;/ref&gt; The film or emulsion is apposed to the labeled tissue section to obtain the autoradiograph (also called an autoradiogram).  The ''auto-'' prefix indicates that the radioactive substance is within the sample, as distinguished from the case of [[historadiography]] or microradiography, in which the sample is X-rayed using an external source. Some autoradiographs can be examined microscopically for localization of silver grains (such as on the interiors or exteriors of cells or organelles) in which the process is termed micro-autoradiography. For example, micro-autoradiography was used to examine whether [[atrazine]] was being metabolized by the [[hornwort]] plant or by epiphytic microorganisms in the biofilm layer surrounding the plant.&lt;ref&gt;Rupassara, S. I., R.A. Larson, G.K. Sims, and K.A. Marley. 2002 Degradation of atrazine by hornwort in aquatic systems. Bioremediation Journal 6(3): 217-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
In biology, this technique may be used to determine the tissue (or cell) localization of a radioactive substance, either introduced into a metabolic pathway, bound to a receptor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kuhar M, Yamamura HI |title=Localization of cholinergic muscarinic receptors in rat brain by light microscopic radioautography |journal=Brain Res. |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=229–43 |date=Jul 1976 |pmid=938940 |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(76)90399-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Young WS, Kuhar MJ |title=A new method for receptor autoradiography: [3H]opioid receptors in rat brain |journal=Brain Res. |volume=179 |issue=2 |pages=255–70 |date=Dec 1979 |pmid=228806 |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(79)90442-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or enzyme, or hybridized to a nucleic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jin L, Lloyd RV |title=In situ hybridization: methods and applications |journal=J Clin Lab Anal. |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=2–9 |year=1997 |pmid=9021518 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2825(1997)11:1&lt;2::AID-JCLA2&gt;3.0.CO;2-F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[radioligand|radiolabeled ligands]] to determine the tissue distributions of receptors is termed either ''[[in vivo]]'' or ''[[in vitro]]'' '''receptor autoradiography''' if the ligand is administered into the circulation (with subsequent tissue removal and sectioning) or applied to the tissue sections, respectively. The ligands are generally labeled with &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H ([[tritium]]) or [[Iodine-125|&lt;sup&gt;125&lt;/sup&gt;I]] ([[radioiodine]]). The distribution of RNA transcripts in tissue sections by the use of radiolabeled, complementary oligonucleotides or ribonucleic acids ("riboprobes") is called [[In situ hybridization|in situ hybridization histochemistry]]. Radioactive precursors of DNA and RNA, [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]-[[thymidine]] and [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]-[[uridine]] respectively, may be introduced to living cells to determine the timing of several phases of the cell cycle. RNA or DNA viral sequences can also be located in this fashion. These probes are usually labeled with &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;P, &lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;P, or &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;S.  In the realm of behavioral endocrinology, autoradiography can be used to determine hormonal uptake and indicate receptor location; an animal can be injected with a radiolabeled hormone, or the study can be conducted ''in vitro''.

The rate of DNA replication in a mouse cell growing ''in vitro'' was measured by autoradiography as 33 nucleotides per second.&lt;ref name="pmid1095649"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hand R |title=Deoxyribonucleic acid fiber autoradiography as a technique for studying the replication of the mammalian chromosome |journal=J.

===Detection of protein phosphorylation===

[[Phosphorylation]] means the posttranslational addition of a [[phosphate group]] to specific amino acids of proteins, and such modification can lead to a drastic change in the stability or the function of a protein in the cell. Protein phosphorylation can be detected on an autoradiograph, after incubating the protein in vitro with the appropriate [[kinase]] and γ-32P-ATP. The radiolabbeled phosphate of latter is incorporated into the protein which is isolated via [[SDS-PAGE]] and visualized on an autoradiograph of the gel. (See figure 3. of a recent study showing that [[CREB-binding protein]] is phosphorylated by [[HIPK2]].&lt;ref name="pmid26247811"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kovacs KA, Steinmann M, Halfon O, Magistretti PJ, Cardinaux JR | title = Complex regulation of CREB-binding protein by homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 | journal = Cell Signaling | volume = 27 | issue = 11 | pages = 2252–60 | date = Nov 2015 | pmid = 26247811 | doi = 10.1016/j.cellsig.2015.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Other techniques===

This autoradiographic approach contrasts to techniques such as [[positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[SPECT]] where the exact 3-dimensional localization of the radiation source is provided by careful use of coincidence counting, gamma counters and other devices.

[[Krypton-85]] is used to inspect aircraft components for small defects. Krypton-85 is allowed to penetrate small cracks, and then its 
presence is detected by autoradiography. The method is called "krypton gas penetrant imaging". The gas penetrates smaller openings than the liquids used in [[dye penetrant inspection]] and [[fluorescent penetrant inspection]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asnt.org/publications/materialseval/solution/decsolutions/decsolutions.htm Krypton Gas Penetrant Imaging - A Valuable Tool for Ensuring Structural Integrity in Aircraft Engine Components] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720084341/http://www.asnt.org/publications/materialseval/solution/decsolutions/decsolutions.htm |date=July 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unintentional exposure===

The task of radioactive decontamination following the ''Baker'' nuclear test at [[Bikini Atoll]] during [[Operation Crossroads]] in 1946 was far more difficult than the U.S. Navy had prepared for. Though the task's futility became apparent and the danger to cleanup crews mounted, Colonel [[Stafford Warren]], in charge of radiation safety, had difficulty persuading Vice Admiral William H. P. Blandy to abandon the cleanup and with it the surviving target ships. On August 10, Warren showed Blandy an autoradiograph made by a [[surgeonfish]] from the lagoon that was left on a photographic plate overnight. The film was exposed by alpha radiation produced from the fish's scales, evidence that plutonium, mimicking calcium, had been distributed throughout the fish. Blandy promptly ordered that all further decontamination work be discontinued. Warren wrote home, "A self x ray of a fish&amp;nbsp;... did the trick."&lt;ref name="Weisgall 1994 242"&gt;{{citation

The dashed line shows the steady-state density profile.]]

'''Bahcall–Wolf cusp''' refers to a particular distribution of [[star]]s around a [[supermassive black hole|massive black hole]] at the center of a [[galaxy]] or [[globular cluster]]. If the nucleus containing the black hole is sufficiently old, exchange of orbital energy between stars drives their distribution toward a characteristic form, such that the density of stars, ''ρ'', varies with distance from the black hole, ''r'', as

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho(r) \propto r^{-7/4} .
&lt;/math&gt;

So far, no clear example of a Bahcall–Wolf cusp has been found in any galaxy or star cluster.&lt;ref name=DEGN&gt;{{cite book|last=Merritt|first=David|author-link=David Merritt|title=Dynamics and Evolution of Galactic Nuclei|year=2013|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL16802359W/Dynamics_and_Evolution_of_Galactic_Nuclei}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be due in part to the difficulty of [[angular resolution|resolving]] such a feature.

==Distribution of stars around a supermassive black hole==

Supermassive black holes reside in [[galactic nuclei]]. The total mass of the stars in a nucleus is roughly equal to the mass of the supermassive black hole. In the case of the [[Milky Way]], the mass of the supermassive black hole is about 4 million [[Solar mass]]es, and the number of stars in the nucleus is about ten million.&lt;ref name="Figer"&gt;

The stars move around the supermassive black hole in [[Kepler orbit|elliptical orbits]], similar to the orbits that planets follow around the Sun. The orbital energy of a star is
:&lt;math&gt;
E = \boldsymbol{v}^2/2 - GM/r
&lt;/math&gt;
where '''''v''''' is the star's velocity, ''r'' is its distance from the supermassive black hole, and ''M'' is the supermassive black hole's mass. A star's energy remains nearly constant for many orbital periods. But after roughly one [[relaxation (physics)#Relaxation in astronomy|relaxation time]], most of the stars in the nucleus will have exchanged energy with other stars, causing their orbits to change.

showed that once this has taken place, the [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution]] of orbital energies has the form

:&lt;math&gt;
N(E)\, dE = N_0 |E|^{-9/4} dE,
&lt;/math&gt;

which corresponds to the density ''ρ''=''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''r'' &lt;sup&gt;−7/4&lt;/sup&gt;. The figure shows how the density of stars evolves toward the Bahcall–Wolf form. The fully formed cusp&lt;ref&gt;The term "cusp" refers to the fact that a graph of density vs. radius has a cuspy appearance if plotted on linear axes, rather than the logarithmic axes used in the figure.&lt;/ref&gt; extends outward to a distance of roughly one-fifth the supermassive black hole's [[sphere of influence (astronomy)|influence radius]]. 
It is believed that relaxation times in the nuclei of small, dense galaxies are short enough for Bahcall–Wolf cusps to form.&lt;ref name="Merritt10"&gt;{{Citation

==The Galactic Center==
The influence radius of the supermassive black hole at the [[Galactic Center]] is about 2–3 [[parsec]]s (pc), and a Bahcall–Wolf cusp if present would extend outward to a distance of about 0.5 pc from the supermassive black hole. A region of this size is easily resolved from Earth. However, no cusp is observed; instead, the density of the oldest stars is flat or even declining toward the Galactic Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

However, current observations imply a relaxation time at the Galactic Center of roughly 10 billion years, comparable with the age of the Milky Way. It is therefore likely that not enough time has elapsed for a Bahcall–Wolf cusp to form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Merritt | first = David | authorlink=David Merritt| title= The Distribution of Stars and Stellar Remnants at the Galactic Center| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 718| year=2010 | pages=739&amp;ndash;761 | doi=10.1088/0004-637X/718/2/739| bibcode=2010ApJ...718..739M|arxiv = 0909.1318 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, some process may have destroyed the bright stars near the supermassive black hole.

==Multi-mass cusps==
The Bahcall–Wolf solution applies to a nucleus consisting of stars of a single mass. If there is a range of masses, each component will have a different density profile. There are two limiting cases. If the more massive stars dominate the total density, their density will follow the Bahcall–Wolf form, whereas the less-massive objects will have ''ρ'' &lt;math&gt;\propto&lt;/math&gt; ''r''&lt;sup&gt;−3/2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="BW77"&gt;{{Citation

In an old stellar population, most of the mass is either in the form of [[main-sequence]] stars, with masses &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; 1–2 Solar masses, or in [[stellar black hole|black hole remnants]], with masses ~ 10–20 Solar masses. It is likely that the main-sequence stars dominate the total density; so their density should follow the Bahcall–Wolf form whereas the black holes should have the steeper, ''ρ'' ~ ''r''&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; profile. On the other hand, it has been suggested that the [[initial mass function|distribution of stellar masses]] at the Galactic Center is "top-heavy", with a much larger fraction of black holes.&lt;ref name="bartko"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Bartko | first1 = H. | last2 = et | first2 = al. | title=An Extremely Top-Heavy Initial Mass Function in the Galactic Center Stellar Disks| journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=708 | year=2010 | pages=834&amp;ndash;840| doi=10.1088/0004-637X/708/1/834 | bibcode=2010ApJ...708..834B|arxiv = 0908.2177 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If this is the case, the observed stars would be expected to attain the shallower density profile, ''ρ'' ~ ''r''&lt;sup&gt;−3/2&lt;/sup&gt;. However, even this shallower profile is probably inconsistent with what is observed at the Galactic Center, implying that a Bahcall–Wolf cusp never formed. The number and distribution of black hole remnants at the Galactic Center is very poorly constrained.

A '''biblical manuscript''' is any handwritten copy of a portion of the text of the [[Bible]]. The word ''Bible'' comes from the Greek ''biblia'' (books); ''[[manuscript]]'' comes from Latin ''manu'' (hand) and ''scriptum'' (written). Biblical manuscripts vary in size from tiny scrolls containing individual verses of the Jewish scriptures (see [[Tefillin]]) to huge [[Polyglot (book)|polyglot]] [[codices]] (multi-lingual books) containing both the Hebrew Bible ([[Tanakh]]) and the [[New Testament]], as well as [[Biblical canon|extracanonical]] works.

The study of biblical manuscripts is important because handwritten copies of books can contain errors. The science of [[textual criticism]] attempts to reconstruct the original text of books, especially those published prior to the [[movable type|invention of the printing press]].

==Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh) manuscripts==
[[File:Aleppo Codex (Deut).jpg|thumb|upright|A page from the [[Aleppo Codex]], Deuteronomy]]

{{main article|List of Hebrew Bible manuscripts}}

The [[Aleppo Codex]] (c. 920 CE) and [[Leningrad Codex]] (c. 1008 CE) were the oldest Hebrew language manuscripts of the [[Tanakh]]. In 1947 CE the finding of the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] at [[Qumran]] pushed the manuscript history of the Tanakh back a millennium from the two earliest complete codices. Before this discovery, the earliest extant manuscripts of the [[Old Testament]] were in Greek in manuscripts such as [[Codex Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus]]. Out of the roughly 800 manuscripts found at Qumran, 220 are from the Tanakh. Every book of the Tanakh is represented except for the [[Book of Esther]]; however, most are fragmentary. Notably, there are two [[scroll]]s of the [[Book of Isaiah]], one complete ([[1QIs-a|1QIs&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;]]), and one around 75% complete ([[1QIs-b|1QIs&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;]]). These manuscripts generally date between 150 BCE to 70 CE.{{sfn|Bruce|1964}}

==New Testament manuscripts==

[[File:Codex Alexandrinus f41v - Luke.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Folio 41v from [[Codex Alexandrinus]] contains the [[Gospel of Luke]] with decorative tailpiece.]]
The [[New Testament]] has been preserved in more manuscripts than any other ancient work of literature, with over 5,800 complete or fragmented [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts catalogued, 10,000 [[Latin]] manuscripts and 9,300 manuscripts in various other ancient languages including [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. The dates of these manuscripts range from c. 125 (the {{Papyrus link|52}} papyrus, oldest copy of John fragments) to the introduction of printing in Germany in the 15th century.

Often, especially in monasteries, a manuscript cache was little more than a former manuscript recycling centre, where imperfect and incomplete copies of manuscripts were stored while the monastery or scriptorium decided what to do with them.{{sfn|Ehrman|2005}} There were several options. The first was to simply "wash" the manuscript and reuse it. Such reused manuscripts were called [[palimpsest]]s and were very common in the ancient world until the [[Middle Ages]]. One notable palimpsest is the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]]. If not done within a short period of time after the papyri was made, washing it was less likely since the papyri might deteriorate and thus be unusable. When washing was no longer an option, the second choice was burning. Since the manuscripts contained the words of Christ, they were thought to have had a level of sanctity;{{sfn|Ehrman|2005}} burning them was considered more reverent than simply throwing them into a garbage pit, which occasionally happened (as in the case of [[Oxyrhynchus 840]]). The third option was to leave them in what has become known as a manuscript gravesite. When scholars come across manuscript caches, such as at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai]] (the source of the [[Codex Sinaiticus]]), or Saint Sabbas Monastery outside [[Bethlehem]], they are finding not libraries but storehouses of rejected texts{{sfn|Ehrman|2005}} sometimes kept in boxes or back shelves in libraries due to space constraints. The texts were unacceptable because of their scribal errors and contain corrections inside the lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.codexsinaiticus.org/en/ |title=Codex Sinaiticus |accessdate=2008-12-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231104440/http://www.codexsinaiticus.org/en/ |archivedate=2008-12-31 |website=Codex Sinaiticus Website }}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly evidence that monastery scribes compared them to a master text. In addition, texts thought to be complete and correct but had deteriorated for heavy usage or had missing [[wikt:folio|folios]] would also be placed in the [[Treasure trove|caches]]. Once in a cache, insects and humidity would often contribute to the continued deterioration of the documents.{{sfn|Ehrman|2005}}

Complete and correctly-copied texts would usually be immediately placed in use and so wore out fairly quickly, which required frequent recopying. Manuscript copying was very costly when it required a scribe's attention for extended periods so a [[manuscript]] might be made only when it was commissioned. The size of the [[parchment]], [[writing system|script]] used, any illustrations (thus raising the effective cost) and whether it was one book or a collection of several would be determined by the one commissioning the work. Stocking extra copies would likely have been considered wasteful and unnecessary since the form and the presentation of a manuscript were typically customized to the aesthetic tastes of the buyer.

Due to the prevalence of manuscript caches, scholars today are more likely to find incomplete and sometimes conflicting segments of manuscripts rather than complete and largely consistent works.{{sfn|Ehrman|2005}}

===Transmission===
The task of copying manuscripts was generally done by [[scribe]]s who were trained professionals in the arts of writing and bookmaking. Some manuscripts were also proofread, and scholars closely examining a text can sometimes find the original and corrections found in certain manuscripts. In the 6th century, a special room devoted to the practice of manuscript writing and [[illuminated manuscript|illumination]] called the [[scriptorium]] came into use, typically inside medieval European monasteries. Sometimes a group of scribes would make copies at the same time as one individual read from the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlham.edu/~seidti/iam/mss_trans.html|title=Seid|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manuscript construction===

An important issue with manuscripts is preservation. The earliest New Testament manuscripts were written on [[papyrus]], made from a reed that grew abundantly in the [[Nile Delta]]. This tradition continued as late as the 8th century.{{sfn|Metzger|Ehrman|2005|p=3f}} Papyrus eventually becomes brittle and deteriorates with age. The dry climate of Egypt allowed some papyrus manuscripts to be partially preserved, but, with the exception of {{Papyrus link|77}}, no New Testament papyrus manuscript is complete; many consist only of a single fragmented page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skypoint.com/members/waltzmn/intro.html#MSTypes|title=Waltz|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the fourth century, [[parchment]] (also called [[vellum]]) began to be a common medium for New Testament manuscripts.{{sfn|Metzger|Ehrman|2005|pp=3-10}} It wasn't until the twelfth century that [[paper]] (made from cotton or plant fibers), which was invented in first-century [[China]], began to gain popularity in biblical manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 476 non-Christian manuscripts dated to the second century, 97% of the manuscripts are in the form of [[scroll]]s; however, eight Christian manuscripts are [[codex|codices]]. In fact, most New Testament manuscripts are codices. The adaptation of the codex form in non-Christian text did not become dominant until the fourth and fifth centuries, showing a preference for that form amongst early Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlham.edu/~seidti/iam/codex.html|title=Seid|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The considerable length of some New Testament books (such as the [[Pauline epistles]]), and the New Testament itself, was not suited to the limited space available on a single scroll; in contrast a codex could be expanded to hundreds of pages.  On its own, however, length alone is an insufficient reason - after all, the Jewish scriptures would continue to be transmitted on scrolls for centuries to come.{{sfn|Kruger|2012|p=249}} Scholars have argued that the codex was adopted as a product of the formation of the New Testament canon, allowing for a specific collections of documents like the Gospels and the Pauline Epistles.{{sfn|Kruger|2012|p=250}} "Canon and codex go hand in hand in the sense that the adoption of a fixed canon could be more easily controlled and promulgated when the codex was the means of gathering together originally separate compositions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elliott |first1=J.K. |title=Manuscripts, the Codex, and the Canon |journal=Journal for the Study of the New Testament |date=1996 |issue=63 |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Script and other features===
[[Image:BookOfDurrowBeginMarkGospel.jpg|thumb|upright|The beginning of the [[Gospel of Mark]] from the [[Book of Durrow]].]]
The handwriting found in New Testament manuscripts varies. One way of classifying handwriting is by formality: book-hand vs. cursive. More formal, literary Greek works were often written in a distinctive style of even, capital letters called book-hand. Less formal writing consisted of cursive letters which could be written quickly. Another way of dividing handwriting is between [[uncial script]] (or majuscule) and [[Roman cursive#New Roman cursive|minuscule]]. The uncial letters were a consistent height between the [[baseline (typography)|baseline]] and the cap height, while the minuscule letters had [[Ascender (typography)|ascenders]] and [[descender]]s that moved past the baseline and cap height. Generally speaking, the majuscules are earlier than the minuscules, with a dividing line roughly in the 11th century.{{sfn|Metzger|Ehrman|2005|pp=17-18, 20}}

The earliest manuscripts had negligible punctuation and breathing marks. The manuscripts also lacked word spacing, so words, sentences, and paragraphs would be a continuous string of letters ([[scriptio continua]]), often with line breaks in the middle of words. Bookmaking was an expensive endeavor, and one way to reduce the number of pages used was to save space. Another method employed was to abbreviate frequent words, such as the ''[[nomina sacra]]''. Yet another method involved the [[palimpsest]], a manuscript which recycled an older manuscript. Scholars using careful examination can sometimes determine what was originally written on the material of a document before it was erased to make way for a new text (for example ''[[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]]'' and the ''[[Syriac Sinaiticus]]'').

The original New Testament books did not have titles, section headings, or [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|verse and chapter divisions]]. These were developed over the years as "helps for readers". The [[Eusebian Canons]] were an early system of division written in the margin of many manuscripts. The Eusebian Canons are a series of tables that grouped parallel stories among the gospels. Starting in the fifth century, subject headings ([[:wikt:κεφαλαία|κεφαλαία]]) were used.

Manuscripts became more ornate over the centuries, which developed into a rich [[illuminated manuscript]] tradition, including the famous Irish [[Gospel Book]]s, the ''[[Book of Kells]]'' and the ''[[Book of Durrow]]''.

===Cataloging===
[[File:SinopeGospelsFolio29rChristHealingBlind.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A page from the [[Sinope Gospels]]. The miniature at the bottom shows [[Jesus]] healing the blind.]]
[[Desiderius Erasmus]] compiled the first printed edition of the Greek New Testament in 1516, basing his work on several manuscripts because he did not have a single complete work and because each manuscript had small errors. In the 18th century, [[Johann Jakob Wettstein]] was one of the first biblical scholars to start cataloging biblical manuscripts. He divided the manuscripts based on the writing used ([[uncial]], minuscule) or format ([[Lectionary|lectionaries]]) and based on content ([[Gospel]]s, [[Pauline epistles|Pauline letters]], [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] + [[General epistles]], and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]). He assigned the uncials letters and minuscules and lectionaries numbers for each grouping of content, which resulted in manuscripts being assigned the same letter or number.&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

For manuscripts that contained the whole New Testament, such as [[Codex Alexandrinus]] (A) and [[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]] (C), the letters corresponded across content groupings. For significant early manuscripts such as [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209]] (B), which did not contain Revelation, the letter B was also assigned to a later 10th-century manuscript of Revelation, thus creating confusion. [[Constantin von Tischendorf]] found one of the earliest, nearly complete copies of the Bible, [[Codex Sinaiticus]], over a century after Wettstein's cataloging system was introduced. Because he felt the manuscript was so important, Von Tischendorf assigned it the Hebrew letter [[aleph]] (א). Eventually enough uncials were found that all the letters in the [[Latin alphabet]] had been used, and scholars moved on to first the [[Greek alphabet]], and eventually started reusing characters by adding a [[superscript]]. Confusion also existed in the minuscules, where up to seven different manuscripts could have the same number or a single manuscript of the complete New Testament could have 4 different numbers to describe the different content groupings.&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, pp. 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor | Von Soden}}Von Soden====

[[Hermann, Freiherr von Soden]] published a complex cataloging system for manuscripts in 1902-10.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann von Soden, ''Die Schriften des Neuen Testaments, in ihrer ältesten erreichbaren Textgestalt hergestellt auf Grund ihrer Textgeschichte'' 4 vols., Berlin: Glaue, 1902-1910.&lt;/ref&gt; He grouped the manuscripts based on content, assigning them a Greek prefix: δ for the complete New Testament, ε for the Gospels, and α for the remaining parts. This grouping was flawed because some manuscripts grouped in δ did not contain Revelation, and many manuscripts grouped in α contained either the general epistles or the Pauline epistles, but not both. After the Greek prefix, Von Soden assigned a numeral that roughly corresponded to a date (for example δ1-δ49 were from before the 10th century, δ150-δ249 for the 11th century). This system proved to be problematic when manuscripts were re-dated, or when more manuscripts were discovered than the number of spaces allocated to a certain century.&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, pp. 40-41&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor | Gregory-Aland}}Gregory–Aland====

[[Caspar René Gregory]] published another cataloging system in 1908 in ''Die griechischen Handschriften des Neuen Testaments'', which is the system still in use today. Gregory divided the manuscripts into four groupings: papyri, uncials, minuscules, and [[Lectionary|lectionaries]]. This division is partially arbitrary. The first grouping is based on the physical material ([[papyrus]]) used in the manuscripts. The second two divisions are based on script: uncial and minuscule. The last grouping is based on content: lectionary. Most of the papyrus manuscripts and the lectionaries before the year 1000 are written in uncial script. There is some consistency in that the majority of the papyri are very early because parchment began to replace papyrus in the 4th century (although the latest papyri dates to the 8th century). Similarly, the majority of the uncials date to before the 11th century, and the majority of the minuscules to after.&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, pp. 73-77&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory assigned the papyri a prefix of '''P''', often written in [[blackletter]] script ({{Papyrus|n}}), with a superscript numeral. The uncials were given a prefix of the number 0, and the established letters for the major manuscripts were retained for redundancy (''e.g.'' [[Codex Claromontanus]] is assigned both '''06''' and '''D'''). The minuscules were given plain numbers, and the lectionaries were prefixed with '''''l''''' often written in script ('''ℓ'''). [[Kurt Aland]] continued Gregory's cataloging work through the 1950s and beyond. Because of this, the numbering system is often referred to as "Gregory-Aland numbers". The most recent manuscripts added to each grouping are {{Papyrus link|131}}, [[Uncial 323|0323]], [[Minuscule 2928|2928]], and ''ℓ'' 2463.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ntvmr.uni-muenster.de/liste New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room] at the [[University of Münster]] website&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the cataloging heritage and because some manuscripts which were initially numbered separately were discovered to be from the same codex, there is some redundancy in the list (''i.e.'' the [[Magdalen papyrus]] has both the numbers of {{Papyrus|64}} and {{Papyrus|67}}).&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, pp. 73f&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of New Testament textual criticism deals with Greek manuscripts because scholars believe the original books of the New Testament were written in Greek. The text of the New Testament is also found both translated in manuscripts of many different languages (called ''versions'') and quoted in manuscripts of the writings of the [[Church Fathers]]. In the [[critical apparatus]] of the [[Novum Testamentum Graece]], a series of abbreviations and prefixes designate different language versions (it for Old Latin, lowercase letters for individual Old Latin manuscripts, vg for [[Vulgate]], lat for Latin, sy&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; for [[Sinaitic Palimpsest]], sy&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; for [[Curetonian Gospels]], sy&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; for the [[Peshitta]], co for Coptic, ac for Akhmimic, bo for Bohairic, sa for Sahidic, arm for Armenian, geo for Georgian, got for Gothic, aeth for Ethiopic, and slav for Old Church Slavonic).&lt;ref&gt;NA&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; 1996, pp. 64*-76*&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dating===
{{additional citations|section|date=October 2018}}
[[Image:Escribano.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration of a European [[scribe]] at work]]
The New Testament books appear to have been completed within the 1st century. The original manuscripts of the New Testament books are not known to have survived. The [[autograph]]s are believed to have been lost or destroyed a long time ago. What survives are copies of the original. Generally speaking, these copies were made centuries after the originals from other copies rather than from the autograph. [[Paleography]], a science of dating manuscripts by typological analysis of their scripts, is the most precise and objective means known for determining the age of a manuscript. Script groups belong typologically to their generation; and changes can be noted with great accuracy over relatively short periods of time. Dating of manuscript material by a [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dating test]] requires that a small part of the material be destroyed in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://original.britannica.com/eb/article-73398/biblical-literature#597996.hook|title=Britannica Online: Types of manuscript errors|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both radiocarbon and paleographical dating only give a range of possible dates, and it is still debated just how narrow this range might be. Dates established by radiocarbon dating can present a range of 10 to over 100 years. Similarly, dates established by paleography can present a range of 25 to over 125 years.&lt;ref&gt;F. V. Greifenhagen, ''Egypt on the Pentateuch's Ideological Map''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Earliest extant manuscripts====
The earliest manuscript of a New Testament text is a business-card-sized fragment from the [[Gospel of John]], [[Rylands Library Papyrus P52]], which may be as early as the first half of the 2nd century. The first complete copies of single New Testament books appear around 200, and the earliest complete copy of the New Testament, the [[Codex Sinaiticus]] dates to the 4th century.{{sfn|Ehrman|2004|pp=479-480}} The following table lists the earliest extant manuscript witnesses for the books of the [[New Testament]].

===Textual criticism===
{{main article|Textual Criticism}}
{{further|Textual variants in the New Testament|List of Bible verses not included in modern translations}}
[[Palaeography]] is the study of ancient writing, and [[textual criticism]] is the study of manuscripts in order to reconstruct a probable original text.

None of the original documents of the New Testament is known to scholars to be extant; and the existing manuscripts differ from one another. The textual critic seeks to ascertain from the divergent copies which form of the text should be regarded as most conforming to the original.{{sfn|Metzger|1992}} The [[New Testament]] has been preserved in three major manuscript traditions: the 4th-century-CE [[Alexandrian text-type]], the [[Western text-type]], and the [[Byzantine text-type]], which includes over 80% of all manuscripts, the majority comparatively very late in the tradition.

Since the mid-19th century, eclecticism, in which there is no ''a priori'' bias to a single manuscript, has been the dominant method of editing the Greek text of the New Testament. This is reflected in the [[Novum Testamentum Graece]], which since 2014 corresponds to both the United Bible Society, 5th edition and Nestle-Aland, 28th edition. In [[textual criticism]], eclecticism is the practice of examining a wide number of text witnesses and selecting the variant that seems best. The result of the process is a text with readings drawn from many witnesses. In a purely eclectic approach, no single witness is theoretically favored. Instead, the critic forms opinions about individual witnesses, relying on both external and internal evidence. Even so, the oldest manuscripts, being of the [[Alexandrian text-type]], are the most favored in these two publications; and the critical text has an Alexandrian disposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Barbara |last=Aland |first2=Joël |last2=Delobel |year=1994 |title=New Testament textual criticism, exegesis and church history: a discussion of methods |location=Kampen |publisher=Kok Pharos |p=138 |isbn=9-03-900105-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most English translations of the New Testament made in the 20th Century were based on these copies.

Textual scholar [[Bart D. Ehrman]] writes: "It is true, of course, that the New Testament is abundantly attested in the manuscripts produced through the ages, but most of these manuscripts are many centuries removed from the originals, and none of them perfectly accurate. They all contain mistakes - altogether many thousands of mistakes. It is not an easy task to reconstruct the original words of the New Testament...."{{sfn|Ehrman|2004|p=449}} In reference to the textual evidence for the New Testament, [[Bruce M. Metzger]] wrote,

{{quote|In evaluating the significance of these statistics...one should consider, by way of contrast, the number of manuscripts which preserve the text of the ancient classics. Homer's ''[[Iliad]]''...is preserved by 457 papyri, 2 uncial manuscripts, and 188 minuscule manuscripts. Among the tragedians the witnesses to [[Euripides]] are the most abundant; his extant works are preserved in 54 papyri and 276 parchment manuscripts, almost all of the later dating from the Byzantine period...the time between the composition of the books of the New Testament and the earliest extant copies is relatively brief. Instead of the lapse of a millennium or more, as is the case of not a few classical authors, several papyrus manuscripts of portions of the New Testament are extant which were copies within a century or so after the composition of the original documents.{{sfn|Metzger|1992|pp=33-35}}{{efn|1=As a footnote to his comments, [[Bruce Metzger|Metzger]] also said, "Lest, however, the wrong impression be conveyed from the statistics given above regarding the total number of Greek manuscripts of the New Testament, it should be pointed out that most of the [[New Testament papyrus|papyri]] are relatively fragmentary and that only about fifty manuscripts (of which the [[Codex Sinaiticus]] is the only [[Uncial script|Uncial manuscript]]) contain the entire New Testament."{{sfn|Metzger|1992|p=34}} }} }}

Biblical scholar [[Gary Habermas]] adds, 

{{quote|What is usually meant is that the New Testament has far more manuscript evidence from a far earlier period than other classical works. There are just under 6000 NT manuscripts, with copies of most of the NT dating from just 100 years or so after its writing. Classical sources almost always have fewer than 20 copies each and usually date from 700-1400 years after the composition of the work. In this regard, the classics are not as well attested. While this doesn't guarantee truthfulness, it means that it is much easier to reconstruct the New Testament text. Regarding genre, the Gospels are usually taken today to be examples of Roman biographies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Reliability and Inspiration of the Bible  |website=Dr. Habermas Answers Important Questions |url=http://www.garyhabermas.com/qa/qa_index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Every year, several New Testament manuscripts handwritten in the original Greek format are discovered. The latest substantial find was in 2008, when 47 new manuscripts were discovered in [[Albania]]; at least 17 of them unknown to Western scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michelle A |last=Vu |url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/nt.scholar.on.discovery.of.giant.trove.of.bible.manuscripts/18204.htm |title=NT scholar on discovery of giant trove of Bible manuscripts |work=[[Christianity Today]] |date=21 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been an estimate of 400,000 variations among all these manuscripts (from the 2nd to 15th century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Daniel |last=Wallace |date=13 April 2009 |title=The Number of Textual Variants: An Evangelical Miscalculation |url=https://bible.org/article/number-textual-variants-evangelical-miscalculation}}&lt;/ref&gt; If you spread those 400,000 variations over 5,600 manuscripts, that comes out to only about 71 variations per manuscript, (400,000 divided by 5,600). And some of these manuscripts are the equivalent of several hundred pages of text, hand-written (see [[Codex Vaticanus]], [[Codex Alexandrinus]], et al.).  The number of variants is additionally less significant than may appear since it is a comparison across linguistic boundaries.  More important estimates focus on comparing texts within languages. Those variations are considerably fewer. The vast majority of these are accidental errors made by [[scribe]]s, and are easily identified as such: [[Haplography|an omitted word]], [[Homoioteleuton|a duplicate line]], a misspelling, a rearrangement of words. Some variations involve apparently intentional changes, which often make more difficult a determination of whether they were corrections from better exemplars, [[harmonization]]s between readings, or ideologically motivated.{{sfn|Ehrman|2004}} Variants are listed in critical editions of the text, the most important of which is the [[Novum Testamentum Graece]], which is the basis for most modern translations. For over 250 years, Christian scholars have argued that no textual variant affects key Christian doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wallace |first=Daniel |date=3 June 2004 |url=https://bible.org/article/majority-text-and-original-text-are-they-identical |title=The Majority Text and the Original Text: Are They Identical? |access-date=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;c.f.

The '''bouba/kiki effect''' is a non-arbitrary mapping between speech sounds and the visual shape of objects. This effect was first observed by German-American psychologist [[Wolfgang Köhler]] in 1929.&lt;ref name = Kohler1929&gt;{{cite book | author = Köhler, W | year = 1929 | title = Gestalt Psychology. | location = New York | publisher = Liveright}}&lt;/ref&gt; In psychological experiments first conducted on the island of [[Tenerife]] (where the primary language is [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), Köhler showed forms similar to those shown at the right and asked participants which shape was called "takete" and which was called "baluba" ("maluma" in the 1947 version). Although not explicitly stated, Köhler implies that there was a strong preference to pair the jagged shape with "takete" and the rounded shape with "baluba".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Köhler, W | year = 1947 | title = Gestalt Psychology | edition = 2nd | location = New York | publisher = Liveright | page = 224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran]] and Edward Hubbard repeated Köhler's experiment using the words "kiki" and "bouba" and asked American college undergraduates and Tamil speakers in India "Which of these shapes is bouba and which is kiki?" In both groups, 95% to 98% selected the curvy shape as "bouba" and the jagged one as "kiki", suggesting that the human brain somehow attaches abstract meanings to the shapes and sounds in a consistent way.&lt;ref name = "Rama2001"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ramachandran, VS | author2 = Hubbard, EM | last-author-amp = yes | year = 2001b | title = Synaesthesia: A window into perception, thought and language | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 8 | issue = 12 | pages = 3–34 | url = http://cbc.ucsd.edu/pdf/Synaesthesia%20-%20JCS.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Work by [[Daphne Maurer]] and colleagues shows that even children as young as 2{{frac|1|2}} years old may show this effect as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maurer D, Pathman T, Mondloch CJ | last-author-amp = yes | year = 2006 | title = The shape of boubas: Sound-shape correspondences in toddlers and adults | journal = Developmental Science | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 316–322 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00495.x | pmid = 16669803 | url = http://psych.mcmaster.ca/maurerlab/Publications/Maurer_bouba.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110723035944/http://psych.mcmaster.ca/maurerlab/Publications/Maurer_bouba.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect does not occur in all communities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogers|first=S.K.|last2=Ross|first2=A.S.|date=1975|title=A cross-cultural test of the maluma-takete phenomenon|url=|journal=Perception|volume=4|pages=105–106|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it appears that the effect breaks if the sounds do not make licit words in the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Syles|first=Suzy|last2=Gawne|first2=Lauren|date=2017|title=When Does Maluma/Takete Fail?

The effect has also been shown to emerge when the words to be paired are existing first names, suggesting that some familiarity with the linguistic stimuli does not eliminate the effect. A study showed that individuals will pair names such as "Molly" with round silhouettes, and names such as "Kate" with sharp silhouettes. Moreover, individuals will associate different personality traits with either group of names (''e.g.'', easygoingness with "round names"; determination with "sharp names"). This may hint at a role of abstract concepts in the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sidhu|first=David M.|last2=Pexman|first2=Penny M.|date=2015-05-27|title=What’s in a Name?

Ramachandran and Hubbard suggest that the kiki/bouba effect has implications for the evolution of language, because it suggests that the naming of objects is not completely arbitrary.&lt;ref name = "Rama2001" /&gt;{{rp|17}} The rounded shape may most commonly be named "bouba" because the mouth makes a more rounded shape to produce that sound while a more taut, angular mouth shape is needed to make the sound "kiki".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=D’Onofrio|first1=Annette|title=Phonetic Detail and Dimensionality in Sound-shape Correspondences: Refining the ''Bouba-Kiki'' Paradigm|journal=Language and Speech|date=15 November 2013|volume=57|issue=3|pages=367–393|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1020.1352&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the distinction may be between [[Coronal consonant|coronal]] or [[Dorsal consonant|dorsal]] consonants like [[Voiceless velar stop|/k/]] and [[Labial consonant|labial]] consonants like [[Voiced bilabial stop|/b/]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Additionally, it was shown that it is not only different consonants (e.g., voiceless versus voiced) and different vowel qualities (e.g., /a/ versus /i/) that play a role in the effect, but also vowel quantity (long versus short vowels). In one study, participants rated words containing long vowels to refer to longer objects and short vowels to short objects.&lt;ref&gt;Bross, F. (2018).

More recently, research indicated that the effect may be a case of [[ideasthesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Gómez Milán, E., Iborra, O., de Córdoba, M.J., Juárez-Ramos V., Rodríguez Artacho, M.A., Rubio, J.L. (2013) The Kiki-Bouba effect: A case of personification and ideaesthesia. ''The Journal of Consciousness Studies.''  20(1-2): pp. 84-102.&lt;/ref&gt; Ideasthesia (alternative spelling ideaesthesia) is defined as a phenomenon in which activations of concepts (inducers) evoke perception-like experiences (concurrents). The name comes from the Greek ''idea'' and ''aisthesis'', meaning "sensing concepts" or "sensing ideas", and was introduced by Danko Nikolić.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nikolić|first1=Danko|title=Is synaesthesia actually ideaestesia?

[[Autism|Autistic]] individuals do not show as strong a preference. Individuals without autism agree with the standard result 88% of the time, while individuals with autism agree only 56% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oberman LM, Ramachandran VS | last-author-amp = yes | year = 2008 | title = Preliminary evidence for deficits in multisensory integration in autism spectrum disorders: the mirror neuron hypothesis | journal = Social Neuroscience |volume = 3 | issue = 3-4 | pages = 348–55 | pmid = 18979385 | doi = 10.1080/17470910701563681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Asher Small''' is a Canadian intellectual, the founder and director of the [[Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy]] the first international interdisciplinary research center dedicated to antisemtism with a contemporary focus.

==Biography==
Dr. Charles Asher Small is the founding director and president of the Institute for the Study of Global Anti-semitism and Policy.  He is also a senior research fellow at the Moshe Dayan Centre for Middle East and African Studies, Tel Aviv University.  Small received his Bachelor of Arts in Political Science, McGill University, Montreal; M.Sc. in Urban Development Planning in Economics, Development Planning Unit, University College London; and a Doctorate of Philosophy (D.Phil.), St. Antony's College, Oxford University. Small completed post-doctorate research at the Groupement de recherche ethnicité et société, Université de Montréal. He was the VATAT{{clarify|date=October 2017}} Research Fellow (Ministry of Higher Education) at Ben Gurion University, Beersheva, and taught in departments of sociology and geography at Goldsmiths' College, University of London; Tel Aviv University; and the Institute of Urban Studies, Hebrew University, Jerusalem. 
 
Small convened groundbreaking academic seminar series in the emerging field of contemporary antisemitism studies at Columbia University, Fordham University, Harvard University, McGill University, National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy, Kyiv, Sapienza University, Rome, the Sorbonne and the CNRS, Paris, Stanford University, University of Miami, Yale University.  Dr. Small also convenes an annual professor training program at Oxford University on Critical Contemporary Antisemitism Studies, where he leads and international effort to train professors; at Hertford College and St. Antony's College, Oxford.

Small was the founding director of the Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Antisemitism, the first interdisciplinary research center on antisemitism at a North American university. At Yale he taught in the Political Science Department and the Program on Ethics, Politics and Economics, and ran a post-doctorate and graduate studies fellowship program at Yale Initiative. Small was also the Koret Distinguished Scholar, Hoover Institution, Stanford University. He was also an associate professor and the director of Urban Studies at Southern Connecticut State University, and an assistant professor at Tel Aviv University in the Department of Geography. He lectured internationally and worked as a consultant and policy advisor in North America, Europe, Southern Africa, and the Middle East. Small specializes in social and cultural theory, globalization and national identity, socio-cultural policy, social movements, and racism – including antisemitism.

Small is the author of books and articles including the six Volume "Global Antisemitism: A Crisis of Modernity"; "the Yale Papers: Antisemitism in Comparative Perspective"; and "Social Theory – a Historical Analysis of Canadian Socio-cultural Policies Race and the Other", Eleven International Publishers; and The Yale Papers: Antisemitism in Comparative Perspective. Small is committed to creating scholarly programming and research on contemporary anti-semitism at top tier universities internationally, and establishing contemporary antisemitism studies as a recognized academic discipline.

Born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, he has a [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil.]] from [[Oxford University]], and has taught at the [[University of London]], [[Ben Gurion University]], [[Tel Aviv University]], and [[Hebrew University]].  Small was also the Koret Distinguished Scholar, Hoover Institution, Stanford University. He was the Director/Associate Professor of [[Urban Studies]] at [[Southern Connecticut State University]]. Small has been a visiting professor at University College London; McGill University, Montreal; the University of Vilnius, Lithuania, and Cape Town University, South Africa. He also spoke as an expert on anti-Semitism at the Australian, British, Canadian, Chilean and Italian Parliaments, the German Bundestag, and at the United Nations, Geneva and in New York.

On September 19, 2006, Yale University founded The Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Antisemitism [http://www.yale.edu/isps/seminars/antisemitism/index.html], the first North American university-based center for study of the subject, housed at the Institute for Social and Policy Studies, with Small as director and founder. He cited the increase in anti-Semitism worldwide in recent years as generating a "need to understand the current manifestation of this disease".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/19/america/NA_GEN_US_Yale_Anti_Semitism.php Yale creates center to study anti-Semitism] Associated Press, September 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;''

In August 2010 in New Haven, Small was elected as the President of the newly formed International Association for the Study of Antisemitism (IASA).

Small was one of a number of academics who submitted evidence to the British All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism. He was also an expert for the Canadian All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism. Charles Asher Small convened an historical conference at the Vatican in September 2017.  The ISGAP-Vatican Conference entitled "Antisemitism and Minority Rights in the Middle East: Regional and International Implications".   The international conference brought together scholars from around the world - Christian, Muslim, Copts, Bahai, Jewish, Catholic thinkers, as well as humans rights activists and policy makers including the British former Prime Minister Tony Blair.

==Study of Antisemitism==
Charles Asher Small and his colleagues at ISGAP have been at the forefront of ensuring that the scholars deal with issues of contemporary antisemitism at the academic level, around the world.

== Contributions ==
In a path-breaking article entitled "Anti-Israel Sentiment Predicts Anti-Semitism in Europe,"[http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/50/4/548.short] in The Journal of Conflict Resolution, Small and Yale's Prof. [[Edward Kaplan]] demonstrated that Europeans who hold deeply anti-Israeli views are  more likely to also have classic anti-Semitic opinions by a significant margin.  Looking at populations in 10 European countries, Small and Kaplan surveyed 5,000 respondents, asking them about Israeli actions and classical anti-Semitic stereotypes. "There were questions about whether the IDF purposely targets children, whether Israel poisons the Palestinians' water supply - these sorts of extreme mythologies," Small says.  They demonstrated that Europeans whose opinions are extremely anti-Israel, are highly likely to also be anti-Semitic. "The people who believed the anti-Israel mythologies also tended to believe that Jews are not honest in business, have dual loyalties, control government and the economy, and the like," Small says. The study demonstrated that an Israel-hating European is 56% more likely to be anti-Semitic than the average European.  "This is extraordinary. It's off the charts," says Small. "If a food or a drug was 56% more likely to cause cancer, it would be taken off the shelf."&lt;ref&gt;Yale expert: Not enough known about anti-Semitism, Aug. 8, 2007, Haviv Rettig Gur , ''The Jerusalem Post'' [http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1186557401345&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Choquequirao''' (possibly from [[Quechua language|Quechua]] ''chuqi'' metal, ''k'iraw'' [[infant bed|crib]], cot)&lt;ref&gt;Diccionario Quechua - Español - Quechua, Academía Mayor de la Lengua Quechua, Gobierno Regional Cusco, Cusco 2005 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary) (5-vowel-system)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ref Bertonio&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teofilo Laime Ajacopa, Diccionario Bilingüe Iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha, La Paz, 2007 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee 1997&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Inca Empire|Incan]] site in south [[Peru]], similar in structure and architecture to [[Machu Picchu]]. The ruins are buildings and terraces at levels above and below Sunch'u Pata, the truncated hill top. The hilltop was anciently leveled and ringed with stones to create a 30 by 50&amp;nbsp;m platform.

Choquequirao at an elevation of {{convert|3050|m|ft}} &lt;ref name="promperu"/&gt;) is in the spurs of the [[Vilcabamba mountain range|Vilcabamba]] mountain range in  the Santa Teresa district,  [[Anta Province|La Convención Province]] of the [[Cusco Region]]. The complex is 1,800&amp;nbsp;hectares, of which 30–40% is excavated.&lt;ref name="elcomercio.com.pe"/&gt; The site overlooks the [[Apurimac River]] canyon which has an elevation of {{convert|1450|m|ft}}.

The site is reached by a two-day hike from outside [[Cusco]].&lt;ref name="elcomercio.com.pe"&gt;[http://www.elcomercio.com.pe/noticia/285557/ruinas-choquequirao-ultimo-refugio-inca Trail to Choquequirao, El Comercio Newspaper, Lima, Peru, May 13, 2009, [Spanish&amp;#93;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416055304/http://www.elcomercio.com.pe/noticia/285557/ruinas-choquequirao-ultimo-refugio-inca |date=April 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Choquequirao has topped in the prestigious  Lonely Planet's Best in Travel 2017 Top Regions list.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.andina.com.pe/Ingles/noticia-peru-choquequirao-tops-lonely-planets-best-in-travel-2017-list-637078.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Choquequirao is a 15th and 16th century settlement associated with the Inca Empire, or more correctly [[Tahuantinsuyo]].&lt;ref name="Echevarría López 2009, p.213"&gt;Echevarría López 2009, p.213.&lt;/ref&gt; The site had two major growth stages. This could be explained if [[Pachacuti]] founded Choquequirao and his son, [[Topa Inca Yupanqui|Tupac Inca Yupanqui]], remodeled and extended it after becoming the [[Sapa Inca]].&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2008, p.83.&lt;/ref&gt;  Choquequirao is located in the area considered to be Pachacuti’s estate; which includes the areas around the rivers Amaybamba, Urabamba, Vilcabamba, Victos and Apurímac. Other sites in this area are [[Sayhuite]], [[Machu Picchu]], Chachabamba ''(Chachapampa)'', Choquesuysuy ''(Chuqisuyuy)'' and Guamanmarca ''(Wamanmarka)''; all of which share similar architectural styles with Choquequirao.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2008, p.82.&lt;/ref&gt;
The architectural style of several important features appears to be of [[Chachapoya]] design, suggesting that Chachapoya workers were probably involved in the construction. This suggests that Tupaq Inka probably ordered the construction. Colonial documents also suggest that Tupac Inca ruled Choquequirao since his great grandson, Tupa Sayri, claimed ownership of the site and neighboring lands during Spanish colonization.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, pp.162-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was one of the last bastions of resistance and refuge of the Son of the Sun (the "Inca"), [[Manco Inca Yupanqui]], who fled [[Cusco]] after his siege of the city failed in 1535.

According to the Peruvian Tourism Office, "Choquequirao was probably one of the entrance check points to the [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcabamba]], and also an administrative hub serving political, social and economic functions. Its urban design has followed the symbolic patterns of the imperial capital, with ritual places dedicated to ''[[Inti]]'' (the Incan sun god) and the ancestors, to the earth, water and other divinities, with mansions for administrators and houses for artisans, warehouses, large dormitories or kallankas and farming terraces belonging to the Inca or the local people. Spreading over 700 meters, the ceremonial area drops as much as 65 meters from the elevated areas to the main square."&lt;ref name="promperu"&gt;[http://www.peru.travel/en/culture/archaeology/choquequirao-1122-2-567-4.1.14 Choquequirao, Peru's Tourism Office, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The city also played an important role as a link between the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon Jungle]] and the city of [[Cusco]].

=== Discovery ===
According to Ethan Todras-Whitehill of the New York Times, Choquequirao's first non-Incan visitor was the [[explorer]] [[Juan Arias Díaz]] in 1710.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/travel/03inca.html?pagewanted=3&amp;_r=1 Ethan Todras-Whitehill on the New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; The first written site reference in 1768 was made by [[Cosme Bueno]], but was ignored at the time.

The Prefect of the Province of Apurimac, J.J. Nuñez, encouraged [[Hiram Bingham III|Hiram Bingham]] to visit the 'Cradle of Gold', in order to discover any Incan treasure.  Bingham was a delegate to the 1908 First Pan American Scientific Congress and was in Cusco at the time.  Bingham decided to visit Choquequirao in 1909 to determine if it was [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcapampa]], the Capital of the last four Incas.  He found three groups of buildings, mummified bodies, and places where dynamite had been used in the search of treasure.  Visitors who had recorded their names included Count de Sartiges, Jose Maria Tejada and Marcelino Leon, 1834, Jose Benigno Samanez, Juan Manuel Rivas Plata and Mariana Cisneros, 1861, and three Almanzas, Pio Mogrovejo, and their treasure hunting workmen, 1885.  However, Bingham decided it was merely a frontier fortress, and tempted him to search further.&lt;ref name="Hiram"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bingham|first1=Hiram|title=Lost City of the Incas|date=1952|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|isbn=9781842125854|pages=112–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location and layout ==
Choquequirao is situated at an elevation of 3,000&amp;nbsp;m above sea level on a southwest-facing spur of a glaciated peak above the [[Apurimac River]].&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, pp.162–163.&lt;/ref&gt; The region is characterized by mountain topography and covered with Amazonian flora and fauna.&lt;ref name="Echevarría López 2009, p.214"&gt;Echevarría López 2009, p.214.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is 98&amp;nbsp;km west of Cusco, in the Vilcabamba range. The complex covers 6&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, p.162.&lt;/ref&gt; Architecturally it is similar to Machu Picchu. The main structures, such as temples, [[huaca]]s, elite residences, and fountain/bath systems are concentrated around two plazas along the crest of the ridge, which encompass approximately 2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and follow Inca urban design. Also there is a conglomeration of common buildings clustered away from the plaza. Excavations and surface items suggest they were probably used for workshops and food preparation.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, pp.163-164.&lt;/ref&gt; Most buildings are well-preserved and well-restored; restoration continues.

The terrain around the site was greatly modified. The central area of the site was leveled artificially and the surrounding hillsides were terraced to allow cultivation and small residential areas.&lt;ref name="Echevarría López 2009, p.214"/&gt; The typical Inca terraces form the largest constructions on site.

Many of the ceremonial structures are associated with water. There are two unusual temple ''wak'a'' sites that lie several hundred meters lower than the two plazas. These are carefully crafted step terraces down a steep slope are designed around water.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; The site also contains a number of ceremonial structures such as the large ''[[ushnu|usnu]]'' built on a truncates hill, the Giant Staircase, and an aqueduct providing water to the water shrines.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sectors===
The archaeological complex of Choquequirao is divided into 12 sectors. While the contents of each sector are different, terraces used for various purposes are common throughout. It seems that most of the buildings here were either for ceremonial purposes, residences of the priests, or used to store food.
    
* Sector I is the highest and most northerly portion of the site. There exist 5 buildings constructed on terraces at varying levels, a temple and a plaza, as well as a smaller plaza in the uppermost area of the sector. Two of the buildings appear to be ''[[qullqa]]s'' (warehouses). The three long buildings, called ''kallankas'' were likely priests’ residences.&lt;ref&gt;Burga, Manuel.(2008). p. 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sector II is where a majority of the ''qullqanpatas'', or depositories are located. In one part of this sector there are 16 ceremonial platforms with canal routes in between that branch off from the main water way.&lt;ref name="Burga"&gt;Burga, Manuel. (2008). p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sector III is between the ''hanan'' (high) area and the ''urin'' (low) area of the complex and contains what is believed to be the Haucaypata ''(Hawkaypata)'', or main plaza. At the periphery of the plaza there are one story and two story buildings. To the north, there is a ''Sunturwasi'' and a single level ''kallanka'' likely used for ceremony.&lt;ref name="Burga" /&gt; To the east are the buildings with two levels. The main plaza is discussed in more detail in the section called '''Ceremonial Center''' of this page.
* Sector IV is located in the southerly area of the complex, known as the ''urin'' zone. The main building here has walls that were probably ceremonial in function since one of them is known as “wall of offerings to the ancestors”.&lt;ref name="Burga" /&gt;
* Sector V is the location of the ''usnu'' which is a hill leveled at the summit to form an oval platform used for ceremony.&lt;ref name="Burga" /&gt; A small wall encircles the hill. From the platform, one can see the main plaza of sector III, the snowcapped mountains and the Apurímac River.
* Sector VI, south of the ''usnu'' in the ''urin'' area, it has the ''Wasi Kancha'' ("house yard"), also known as the priests' quarters. There are four terraces here that were used as ceremonial space.&lt;ref&gt;Burga, Manuel. (2008). p. 104-105.&lt;/ref&gt; In the walls of the terraces there is a zigzagged design.
* Sector VII can be reached from the main plaza by pathway. Located on the east side of Choquequirao, this zone contains cultivation terraces that have markedly greater amplitude than all others throughout the complex.
* Sector VIII, on the western side of the complex, has 80 cultivation terraces divided into plots by water canals that stream down from the main plaza. In this zone, one will find the famous "Llamas del Sol".&lt;ref&gt;Burga, Manuel. (2008). p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sector IX contains general living quarters for groups of people, such as workers or families. The buildings are constructed on top of artificial platforms in circular and rectangular design, interconnected by stairways and narrow alleys.
* Sector X, called ''paraqtepata'', has 18 terraced platforms that have irrigation canals running parallel to the stairs.&lt;ref name="manuel"&gt;Burga, Manuel. (2008). p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sector XI has 80 terraces used for cultivation, called ''phaqchayuq'' ("the one with a waterfall"), which are the most extensive in the entire complex.&lt;ref name="manuel" /&gt; Also found here are small, quadrilateral enclosures with two levels used for both ceremony and living. Outside, there are three water fountains used for drinking and to supply the irrigation canals.
* Sector XII lies three hours away (by foot) from the upper part of the complex. Here there are 57 platforms with permanent irrigation systems. In the uppermost terraces there are buildings for ceremony and a pool of water fed by a spring. In the semicircular enclosures ceramic shards, stone tools and remains of bones have been found.&lt;ref name="manuel" /&gt;

===Ceremonial center===
The ceremonial center of Choquequirao shares many features similar to those of other Inca ceremonial centers and pilgrimage sites, such as Isla del Sol, Quespiwanka (''Qhispi Wank'a'', palace of [[Huayna Capac]]), Machu Picchu/[[Llaqtapata]], [[Tipon]] and Saywite. The long and treacherous route from Cusco to Choquequirao likely passed by Machu Picchu, leading onto the face of Machu Picchu Peak. From Llaqtapata, the path continued down into the Mollepata Valley, traversed the Yanamia pass at 4670 m, and continued across the Rio Blanco, finally reaching Choquequirao from above after an estimated 7- to 10-day journey.&lt;ref name=Malville&gt;Ziegler 2011, p.167.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceremonial center consists of a main platform and a lower plaza. Stone lined channels carried ceremonial water, or chicha to shrines and baths throughout the site. The main platform, unique in its size and prominence, limited ceremonial activity to royalty and the ministerial class. This seems as such due to evidence showing that the only entrance to the platform was through a double-jam doorway, which functioned to control access to the sacred space.&lt;ref name=Malville/&gt; Other features of the ceremonial center include structures that mark the direction of certain solar events, such as when the June and December solstice sun rises and sets.
 
Located in the main platform, the Giant Stairway opens to the sunrise of the December solstice. Measured at 25 meters long and 4.4 meters wide, this structure seems to have been purely ceremonial in function, since the stairs end abruptly partway down a hill, leading to nothing. Large boulders that rest upon the risers of the stairway become fully illuminated when the December solstice sun rises. Gary R. Ziegler and J. McKim Malville have postulated that when the boulders become illuminated, a ''wak'a'' is activated by its solar camaquen—a case similar to when the large stone of the Torreon at Machu Picchu becomes illuminated.&lt;ref name=Malville/&gt;
 
In the lower plaza a group of structures were found that appeared to be water shrines and baths. This belief is held based on their strong resemblance to those at sector II of Llaqtapata and because there are numerous water channels leading to that portion of the plaza.&lt;ref name=Malville/&gt; Overall, it seems as though the site was chosen, as Machu Picchu was, for its sacred geographical location, and was designed to facilitate ritual and ceremonial activity.

===Subsectors===
The area around Choquequiaro contains several subsectors that have been associated with the Inca culture that thrived in Choquequirao, suggesting that the subsectors are most likely part of the site. Design, construction style, and cultural parallels support that these sectors were tightly intertwined with Choquequiaro and the Inca at some point in their history. The lack of residential space in these sectors suggests that these were probably farming outposts from Choquequirao rather than an independent site.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2008, pp.81-82&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to differences in design and construction styles, it is believed that these sectors were built in three different phases.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2008, p.77.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Choquequirao art style, the subsector also contains multiple camelid art and ceremonial ''phaqchas'' that are tightly related to Inca, especially Pachacuti’s government.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2008, pp.81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materials===
All lithic materials utilized for the construction of the site and surrounding sectors were mined from the local quarries.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2008, p.72&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the [[metamorphic rock]] in the quarries of Choquequirao, superb masonry like that at Machu Picchu could not be obtained. Instead, the entrances and corners were shaped from [[quartzite]], and the walls were made of achlar and plastered with clay and then painted in a light orange color.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, pp.164-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
Most of the rock art in Choquequirao is in the terraced area where cultivation occurred. Archaeologists have documented twenty-five semi-naturalistic figures on the terraces of sector VIII of Choquequirao. The rocks used to build the walls are dark [[schist]] while the camelid images are of white [[calcocuarcita]], a sandstone of quartz and carbonate.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2009, pp.214-215.&lt;/ref&gt; The camelid motifs vary between a maximum height of 1.94&amp;nbsp;m and one minimum of 1.25&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2009, p.216.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, archaeologist Zenobio Valencia from the University of San Antonio Abad of Cusco found several camelid figurines made of white stones in a group of terraces in one sector of the archaeological site.&lt;ref name="Echevarría López 2009, p.213"/&gt;

One recent discovery for example, uncovered a scene laid into the stone terraces with white quartzite depicting several llamas loaded with cargo standing by their handlers. Present on the uppermost terrace wall is a zigzag pattern of the same quartzite. This style of design is uniquely [[Chachapoya]] and not found in other sites of Inca construction, indicating that workers from Chachapoya may have been involved in the construction of Choquequirao.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access==
Presently the only way to access Choquequirao is by a hard hike. The common trail head begins at the village of San Pedro de Cachora,&lt;ref name="Horizon Guides"&gt;[https://horizontravelpress.com/guides/trekking-to-machu-picchu-013 Trekking To Machu Picchu, Horizon Guides, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; which is approximately a 4-hour drive from Cuzco, along the Cusco-Abancay route. Another access point is from Huanipaca village, whose crossroad is located on the same route Cusco-Abancay, 4–5&amp;nbsp;km beyond the Cachora crossroad. Huanipaca offers a 15&amp;nbsp;km trail, half distance less than Cachora trail (31&amp;nbsp;km). Over 5,000 people trekked to Choquequirao in 2013. From Choquequirao it is possible to continue hiking to Machu Picchu. Most treks range from 7-day to 11-day hikes, and involve going over the Yanama Pass, which at 4,668&amp;nbsp;m is the highest point on the trek.

The construction of the cable car to Choquequirao has been declared a priority by the [[Apurímac Region|Apurímac Regional Government]], which are destined to receive 220 million Peruvian Soles (US$82.7 million) to fund the project. It will reduce a two-day hike to a 15-minute cable car ride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Salazar|first=Carla|title=Tramway planned for Machu Picchu’s ‘sister city’|url=https://news.yahoo.com/tramway-planned-machu-picchus-sister-city-065213029.html|work=AP Travel|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlos Canales, president of the National Chamber of Tourism (Canatur) believes that in the first year of operation the Choquequirao cable car will receive 200,000 tourists, which will generate an income of US$4 million, with the average visitor paying US$20 per ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Choquequirao recibiría 600 mil viajeros en el 2018 con teleférico|url=http://elcomercio.pe/turismo/1506503/noticia-apurimac-recibiria-600-mil-viajeros-2018-gracias-teleferico-choquequirao?ft=grid|newspaper=El Comercio|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hubert Lamb Building.jpg|right|thumb|The Hubert Lamb Building, University of East Anglia, where the Climatic Research Unit is based]]
The '''Climatic Research Unit''' ('''CRU''') is a component of the [[University of East Anglia]] and is one of the leading institutions concerned with the study of natural and [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Brown | first = Craig | title = The forecast for Scotland: wet, wet, wet | work = The Scotsman | date = 8 February 2005 | url = http://news.scotsman.com/weather/The-forecast-for-Scotland-wet.2601547.jp | accessdate = 1 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a staff of some thirty research scientists and students, the CRU has contributed to the development of a number of the data sets widely used in climate research, including one of the global temperature records used to monitor the state of the climate system,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/about/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Global temperature 2008: Another top-ten-year | publisher = Met Office | date = 3 January 2008 | url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/corporate/pressoffice/2008/pr20080103.html | accessdate = 1 November 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080511184106/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/corporate/pressoffice/2008/pr20080103.html | archivedate = 11 May 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as statistical software packages and [[climate model]]s.&lt;ref name="UEA Climatic Research Unit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/about/ |title=About the Climatic Research Unit|accessdate=5 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The CRU was founded in 1971 as part of the university's School of [[Environmental science]]s. The establishment of the Unit owed much to the support of Sir [[Graham Sutton]], a former Director-General of the [[Meteorological Office]], Lord [[Solly Zuckerman]], an adviser to the University, and Professors [[Keith Clayton]] and [[Brian Funnel]], Deans of the School of Environmental Sciences in 1971 and 1972.&lt;ref name="Hulme-xxvii"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Hulme, Michael|editor2=Barrow, Elaine|author1=Lamb, H.H.|author2=Clayton, K.M.|author3=Wigley, T.M.L.|title=Climates of the British Isles: present, past and future|chapter=The Climatic Research Unit at Twenty-five Years|page=xxvii–xxix|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=978-0-415-13016-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FZVVkhW8wL8C&amp;pg=PR27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HistUAE285/&gt; Initial sponsors included [[BP|British Petroleum]], the [[Nuffield Foundation]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]].&lt;ref name=HistUAE285&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=50HjSi5o8J0C&amp;pg=PA285 |title=The history of the University of East Anglia, Norwich |author=Michael Sanderson |page=285 |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-85285-336-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rockefeller Foundation]] was another early benefactor, and the [[Wolfson Foundation]] gave the Unit its current building in 1986.&lt;ref name="Hulme-xxvii" /&gt; Since the second half of the 1970s the Unit has also received funding through a series of contracts with the [[United States Department of Energy]] to support the work of those involved in climate reconstruction and analysis of the effects on climate of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref name="Hulme-xxviii"&gt;Hulme &amp; Barrow (1997), p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; The UK Government ([[Margaret Thatcher]]) became a strong supporter of climate research in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name = HistoryCRU /&gt;

The first director of the unit was Professor [[Hubert Lamb]], who had previously led research into climatic variation at the [[Met Office]].&lt;ref name=HistUAE285/&gt; He was then known as the "''ice man''" for his prediction of [[global cooling]] and a coming [[ice age]] but, following the UK's exceptionally [[1976 United Kingdom heat wave|hot summer of 1976]], he switched to predicting a more imminent [[global warming]].&lt;ref name=HistUAE285/&gt; The possibility of major weather changes and flooding attracted attention to the unit and sponsorship by major insurance companies wanting to mitigate their potential losses.&lt;ref name=HistUAE285/&gt; Prior to the Unit's establishment, it had widely been believed by the meteorological establishment that the climate was essentially constant and unvarying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maunder|first=W.J.|title=The uncertainty business: risks and opportunities in weather and climate|page=6|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1986|isbn=978-0-416-36100-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamb and others in the climatological community had for years argued that the climate system was in fact highly variable on timescales of decades to centuries and longer. The establishment of the CRU enabled Lamb and his colleagues to focus on this issue and eventually to win the argument decisively.&lt;ref name="Hulme-xxvii" /&gt;

Hubert Lamb retired in 1978. His successors were [[Tom Wigley]] (1978–1993), [[Trevor Davies]] (1993–1998), [[Jean Palutikof]] and [[Phil Jones (climatologist)|Phil Jones]] (jointly 1998–2004), Phil Jones (2004–2016), and [[Tim Osborn]] (from January 2017);&lt;ref name=HistoryCRU&gt;{{cite web|title = History of the Climatic Research Unit|publisher = Climatic Research Unit, [[University of East Anglia]]|url = http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/about-cru/history|accessdate = 21 January 2017|archivedate = 18 January 2017|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170118234215/http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/about-cru/history|deadurl = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url = https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/tim-osborn-to-take-over-leadership-of-cru|title = Tim Osborn to take over leadership of CRU|publisher = [[University of East Anglia]]|date = 21 December 2016|accessdate = 20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Liss]] was acting director during investigations between December 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url = http://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/2009/dec/CRUphiljones|title = CRU Update 3|date = 1 December 2009|accessdate = 14 April 2010|archivedate = 2 December 2014|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141202075038/http://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/2009/dec/CRUphiljones|deadurl = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and July 2010.&lt;ref name="McCarthy2010-07-08"&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/conspiracy-theories-finally-laid-to-rest-by-report-on-leaked-climate-change-emails-2021222.html|last = McCarthy|first = Michael|title = 'Conspiracy theories finally laid to rest' by report on leaked climate change emails|date = 8 July 2010|newspaper = [[The Independent]]|accessdate = 20 January 2017|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160307144651/http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/conspiracy-theories-finally-laid-to-rest-by-report-on-leaked-climate-change-emails-2021222.html|archivedate = 7 March 2016|deadurl = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, the unit moved to a new cylindrical building designed by [[Rick Mather]].&lt;ref name=HistUAE345&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=50HjSi5o8J0C&amp;pg=PA345|title = The history of the University of East Anglia, Norwich|first = Michael|last = Sanderson|page = 345|year = 2002|isbn=978-1-85285-336-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, this was named the ''Hubert Lamb Building'' in honour of the first director.&lt;ref name="Pearce"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink = Fred Pearce|last = Pearce|first = Fred|title = The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming|year = 2010|publisher = [[Guardian Books]]|isbn = 978-0-85265-229-9|page = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

At the time of its establishment the CRU set out four key aims, which still remain valid:

* To establish firmer knowledge of the history of climate in the recent and distant past.
* To monitor and report on current climatic developments on a global scale.
* To identify the processes (natural and man-made) at work in climatic fluctuations and the characteristic timescales of their evolution.
* To investigate the possibilities of making advisory statements about future trends of weather and climate from a season to many years ahead, based on acceptable scientific methods and in a form likely to be useful for long-term planning purposes.&lt;ref&gt;''Climate Research Unit Monthly Bulletin'', 1972, vol. 1, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

CRU produces a range of climate datasets, covering temperature, precipitation, pressure and circulation, both global and regional.&lt;ref name="Data"&gt;{{cite web |title=Data | website=CRU | url=http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/data | accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the CRU's most significant products is the CRUTEM global dataset of land near-surface temperature anomalies on a 5° by 5° grid-box basis, which is compiled in conjunction with the [[Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research]] and its sea-surface temperature dataset to produce the [[HadCRUT]] [[Instrumental temperature record|temperature record]].&lt;ref name="CRUTEM"&gt;{{cite web | title=Temperature data (HadCRUT4) | website=CRU | date=27 August 2015 | url=http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/ | accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; First compiled in the early 1980s, the record documents global temperature fluctuations since the 1850s. The CRU compiles the land component of the record and the Hadley Centre provides the marine component. The merged record is used by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] in all its publications.&lt;ref name="Hulme-xxviii" /&gt; Other products include the CRU TS high resolution gridded land surface dataset of multiple factors including precipitation, vapour pressure and cloud cover as well as temperatures.&lt;ref name="CRU TS"&gt;{{cite web | title=High-resolution gridded datasets | website=CRU | date=1 September 2015 | url=http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/ | accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRU is also involved in a study of Eurasian climate over the last 10,000 years based upon [[dendroclimatology|tree ring data]] and a study of European climate in the last 200 years based upon temperature records.&lt;ref name=ed/&gt; It is a participant in MEDALUS – the [[Mediterranean Desertification and Land Use project]].&lt;ref name=ed&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OFmadtCvtRoC&amp;pg=PA72 |pages=72–3 |title=The environment dictionary |author=David D. Kemp |isbn=978-0-415-12752-3 |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custodians of the raw data are the [[:Template:National Meteorological Organisations|National Meteorological Organisations]] that originated the data; CRU retains most but not all of the raw data, which continues to be held by the originating services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bravender|first=Robin|title=CLIMATE: Scientists return fire at sceptics in 'destroyed data' dispute|work=Greenwire|url=http://www.eenews.net/public/Greenwire/2009/10/14/3|date=14 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It published a quarterly journal, ''Climate Monitor''.&lt;ref name=ed/&gt; This ceased publication in 1998, being replaced by an online version, ''Climate Monitor Online''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/climon/ |title=Climate Monitor Online |year=2004 |accessdate=27 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604225349/http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/climon/ |archivedate=4 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release of raw meteorological data === 
{{main|Freedom of Information requests to the Climatic Research Unit}}
The CRU collates data from many sources around the world. In August 2009 its director, [[Phil Jones (climatologist)|Phil Jones]], told the science journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' that he was working to make the data publicly available with the agreement of its owners but this was expected to take some months, and objections were anticipated from National Meteorological Organisations that made money from selling the data. It was not free to share that data without the permission of its owners because of confidentiality agreements, including with institutions in Spain, Germany, Bahrain and Norway, that restricted the data to academic use. In some cases the agreements were made orally, and some of the written agreements had been lost during a move. Despite this, the CRU was the focus of numerous requests under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] for data used by the unit's scientists. ''Nature'' reported that in the course of five days in July 2009 the CRU had been "inundated" with 58 FOI requests from [[Stephen McIntyre]] and people affiliated with his [[Climate Audit]] blog requesting access to raw climate data or information about their use.&lt;ref name="Nature 20090812"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090812/full/460787a.html|title=Climate data spat intensifies|date=12 August 2009|issue=460|page=787|work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]}} Subscription or payment required to read article.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2011 a large amount of raw weather station data had been released by the [[Met Office]] and the US [[Global Historical Climatology Network]], but around two-thirds of the data owners did not respond to the CRU requests for agreement, and both [[Poland]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] declined. Two FOIA requests for data shared with another researcher were refused by the university, and the requestors appealed this to the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO). In its decision released on 23 June 2011, the ICO required CRU to release the remaining raw data irrespective of the wishes of the meteorological organisations which owned the data. This decision included data from Trinidad and Tobago but did not cover Poland. The raw data release was completed by 27 July 2011.&lt;ref name="beeb 27 July 2011"&gt;{{Cite web |last = Black | first = Richard | title = Climate unit releases virtually all remaining data | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14315747 |work=''BBC News''|date = 27 July 2011 | accessdate =15 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== CRU email controversy ==
{{Main|Climatic Research Unit email controversy}}
In November 2009, [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] gained access to a server used by the CRU and stole a large quantity of data, anonymously posting online more than 1,000 emails and more than 2,000 other documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hackers target leading climate research unit|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8370282.stm|work=''BBC News''|date=20 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Climate Strife Comes to Light|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125883405294859215|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=23 November 2009 | first=Keith | last=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[climate change denial|climate change sceptics]] including bloggers asserted that a number of the leaked e-mails contain evidence supporting their [[global warming conspiracy theory]] that scientists had allegedly conspired to manipulate data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Stringer, David |date=21 November 2009 |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ikaqlFpp9jCRHWN0zNuamKXfyeMgD9C441LG0 |title=Hackers leak e-mails, stoke climate debate |agency=Associated Press |quote=Some climate change skeptics and bloggers claim the information shows scientists have overstated the case for global warming, and allege the documents contain proof that some researchers have attempted to manipulate data.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "RevkinNYT"&gt;Revkin, Andrew.

In 2011, a new analysis of temperature data by the independent [[Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature]] group, many of whom had stated publicly that they thought it was possible that the CRU had manipulated data, concluded that "these studies were done carefully and that potential biases identified by climate change sceptics did not seriously affect their conclusions".&lt;ref name=bbcBlack&gt;{{Cite news|title=Global warming 'confirmed' by independent study |author=Richard Black|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15373071 |publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=21 October 2011|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5712">A '''corrosion inhibitor''' is a [[chemical compound]] that, when added to a liquid or gas, decreases the [[corrosion]] rate of a material, typically a [[metal]] or an [[alloy]].&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Gräfen, Elmar-Manfred Horn, Hartmut Schlecker, Helmut Schindler "Corrosion" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH: Weinheim, 2002. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.b01_08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of a corrosion inhibitor depends on fluid composition, quantity of water, and flow regime. A common mechanism for inhibiting corrosion involves formation of a coating, often a [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] layer, which prevents access of the corrosive substance to the metal. Permanent treatments such as [[chrome plating]] are not generally considered inhibitors, however. Instead corrosion inhibitors are ''additives'' to the fluids that surround the metal or related object.

Corrosion inhibitors are common in industry, and also found in over-the-counter products, typically in spray form in combination with a [[lubricant]] and sometimes a [[penetrating oil]].

==Types==
[[File:CuBTApolymer.png|thumb|[[Benzotriazole]] inhibits corrosion of copper by forming an inert layer of this polymer on the metal's surface]]
The nature of the corrosive inhibitor depends on (i) the material being protected, which are most commonly metal objects, and (ii) on the corrosive agent(s) to be neutralized. The corrosive agents are generally oxygen, hydrogen sulfide, and [[carbon dioxide]]. Oxygen is generally removed by reductive inhibitors such as [[amine]]s and [[hydrazine]]s:
:O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
In this example, [[hydrazine]] converts oxygen, a common corrosive agent, to water, which is generally benign. Related inhibitors of oxygen corrosion are [[hexamine]], [[phenylenediamine]], and [[dimethylethanolamine]], and their derivatives. [[Antioxidant]]s such as sulfite and [[ascorbic acid]] are sometimes used. Some corrosion inhibitors form a [[passivation (chemistry)|passivating coating]] on the surface by [[chemisorption]]. [[Benzotriazole]] is one such species used to protect [[copper]]. For [[lubrication]], [[zinc dithiophosphate]]s are common - they deposit sulfide on surfaces.

The suitability of any given chemical for a task in hand depends on many factors, including their [[operating temperature]].

==Illustrative applications==
*Volatile amines are used in [[boiler]]s to minimize the effects of acid. In some cases, the amines form a protective film on the steel surface and, at the same time, act as an anodic inhibitor. An inhibitor that acts both in a cathodic and anodic manner is termed a ''mixed inhibitor''.
*[[Benzotriazole]] inhibits the corrosion and staining of copper surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;M. Finšgarand and I. Milošev "Inhibition of copper corrosion by 1,2,3-benzotriazole: A review" Corrosion Science 2010, Volume 52, Pages 2737-2749 {{doi|10.1016/j.corsci.2010.05.002}} &lt;/ref&gt;
*Corrosion inhibitors are often added to [[paint]]s. A [[pigment]] with anticorrosive properties is [[zinc phosphate]]. Compounds derived from [[tannic acid]] or zinc salts of organonitrogens (e.g. Alcophor 827) can be used together with anticorrosive pigments. Other corrosion inhibitors are Anticor 70, Albaex, Ferrophos, and Molywhite MZAP.
*[[Antiseptic]]s are used to counter [[microbial corrosion]]. [[Benzalkonium chloride]] is commonly used in [[oil field]] industry.
*In oil refineries, [[hydrogen sulfide]] can corrode steels so it is removed often using air and amines by conversion to [[polysulfide]]s.
===Fuels industry===
Corrosion inhibitors are commonly added to [[antifreeze (coolant)|coolant]]s, fuels, [[hydraulic fluid]]s, [[boiler water]], [[engine oil]], and many other fluids used in industry. For fuels, various corrosion inhibitors can be used. Some components include [[zinc dithiophosphate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050218035909/http://www.octel-starreon.com/Products_RFA_Corrosion.htm Octel-Starreon Refinery Fuel Additives Corrosion Inhibitors for hydrocarbon fuels - corrosion inhibitor and corrosion protection to fuel distribution system]&lt;/ref&gt;
* DCI-4A, widely used in commercial and military [[jet fuel]]s, acts also as a [[lubricity]] additive. Can be also used for [[gasoline]]s and other [[distillate]] fuels.
* DCI-6A, for motor gasoline and distillate fuels, and for [[U.S. military]] fuels ([[JP-4]], [[JP-5]], [[JP-8]])
* DCI-11, for alcohols and gasolines containing [[oxygenate]]s
* DCI-28, for very low-pH alcohols and gasolines containing oxygenates
* DCI-30, for gasoline and distillate fuels, excellent for pipeline transfers and storage, caustic-resistant
* DMA-4 (solution of alkylaminophosphate in kerosene), for petroleum distillates

'''Dhairya Dand''' (born 27 April 1989) is an Indian-born New York City based inventor and artist.

His work investigates the human body as a medium for computation, new materials as a tool to embody interactions and design as a vehicle for mindfulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tedxhamburg.de/speaker-2015 | title=Dhairya Dand |publisher=TEDxHamburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work takes form of devices, objects, installations, new technology and materials.

Currently Dand is a Principal at ODD Industries, a futurist factory and lab in NYC, an artist in residence at the [[New Museum|NEW Museum]] and on the advisory board of the [[X PRIZE Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://safety.xprize.org/about/advisory-board | title=Advisory Board, Women's Safety XPRIZE|publisher=XPRIZE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dand is a core member of the [[W3C]] Standards Committee which governs the Internet at large. He has taught conceptual design based courses at the [[The Art Institute of Seattle|Art Institute of Seattle]], the [[Carnegie Mellon School of Design]], [[Tisch School of the Arts]] and the MIT Design Innovation Workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhairyadand |title=Dhairya Dand LinkedIn Page |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=LinkedIn |access-date=January 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dand is a graduate of the Media, Arts and Sciences program at the [[MIT Media Lab]].

== Early life ==
Dand was born in [[Nashik, India]] to parents who were plumbers and storytellers. Dand attributes his cross-disciplinary work to being trained as a plumber by his father and listening to stories and mythologies from his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/interview-dhairya-dand-moved-by-stories-driven-by-curiosities-2145335 | title=Dhairya Dand: Moved by stories, driven by curiosities |publisher=DNA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/dhairya-dands-journey-from-nashik-to-mit-media-lab-a-dedication-to-hard-work/articleshow/34762675.cms | title=Dhairya Dand's journey from Nashik to MIT Media Lab a dedication to hard work  |publisher=Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended [[Victoria Jubilee Technological Institute]] for an undergraduate in Computer Science and the [[Industrial Design Centre]] for courses in design. Dand later lived in Singapore, [[Phnom Penh]], Tokyo, London, [[Kampala]] before moving to the United States to study at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbesindia.com/article/30-under-30/dhairya-dand-blending-imagination-and-reality/39559/1 | title=Dhairya Dand: Blending imagination and reality |publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/interview-dhairya-dand-moved-by-stories-driven-by-curiosities-2145335 | title=Dhairya Dand: Moved by stories, driven by curiosities |publisher=DNA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hDHd6NsZKU
 | title=Brand Equity: In Conversation With MIT Media Labs’ Dhairya Dand &amp; Deepak Jagdish |publisher=ET NOW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==

Dand's inventions range from sensorial interfaces, [[smart devices]], [[display technologies]], [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]], [[social systems]], [[prosthesis]], bio-based architecture, [[educational toys]], [[robotics|emotional robots]].

In SuperShoes, Dand created insoles that work on a tickling interface, they tickle the feet and guide the wearer across the city. The insoles talk to the smartphone for location, data and access to the users personality preferences. The insoles help with navigation, reminders, taking mindful breaks, discovering new places in a city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/3029610/mits-vibrating-supershoes-tell-you-where-to-walk | title= MIT's Vibrating Supershoes Tell You Where To Walk

In Programmable Hair, Dand made a contraption worn on the hair that allows the wearer to program their hairstyle, either by choosing from a library of hairstyles or by taking a picture of someone else's hairstyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uop2Rj6HI2s | title='Love, See, Do. Repeat', Dhairya Dand |publisher=TEDx Hamburg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Obake, Dand created a 2.5D elastic computer [[display technology]] that has shape memory. The display can be physically deformed, stretched, pulled, pushed. It remembers shapes and can self-actuate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativeapplications.net/openframeworks/obake-o-baa-keh-2-5d-interaction-gestures-to-manipulate-3d-surfaces/ | title='Obake' (o-baa-keh) – 2.5D interaction gestures to manipulate 3D surfaces|publisher=Creative Applications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/obake-is-an-elasticated | title=3D?

 | title=Elastic touchscreen prototype lets you pinch and zoom in '2.5D' |publisher=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Seattle, Dand was part of [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]'s secretive Concept Lab, where he is credited for key inventions and [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]] devices. Some of his inventions which are public, involve invisible interfaces and using hand gestures to use the air as a medium for computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=20170046037.PGNR.| title=Gestures for sharing data between devices in close physical proximity|publisher=USPTO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dand's Cheers are alcohol aware ice-cubes that know how much the person is drinking. They change their colors depending on how much the person has consumed alcohol, they also strobe in response to the ambient music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/01/11/mit-student-invents-led-ice-cubes-that-track-how-much-youve-been-drinking/ | title=MIT Student Invents LED Ice Cubes That Track How Much You've Been Drinking|publisher=TIME Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2013/01/mit-student-invents-led-ice-cubes-to-track-alcohol-intake/ | title=MIT Student Invents LED Ice Cubes to Track Alcohol Intake |publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/videos/bestoftv/2013/01/18/vo-mit-smart-ice-cubes.dhairya-dand | title=Too much to drink?

Dand designed a bio-building that responds and reacts to its environment. During the day, cells in the building's 'membranes' open up, allowing for more ventilation; at night, they generate and conserve warmth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbesindia.com/article/30-under-30/dhairya-dand-blending-imagination-and-reality/39559/1 | title=Dhairya Dand: Blending imagination and reality |publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dand's ThinkerToys are modular educational toys made from e-Waste which later led to an NGO called openTOYS. By plugging in these modules, a keyboard can be used as a piano, a mouse for language learning and speakers as storytelling devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/1/2916875/thinkertoy-educational-toys-opentoys-arduino | title=ThinkerToys repurpose old keyboards, mice, and monitors into educational toys |publisher=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://makezine.com/2012/03/21/thinkertoys-turn-e-waste-into-fun-gadgetry/ | title=Thinkertoys Turn E-Waste into Fun Gadgetry |publisher=Make Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newatlas.com/thinkertoys-educational-toys-ewaste/21960/ | title=Using e-waste to create educational toys, with ThinkerToys |publisher=New Atlas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his early work was Lokshahi, which was a m-governance system for political transparency in rural India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/interview-dhairya-dand-moved-by-stories-driven-by-curiosities-2145335 | title=Dhairya Dand: Moved by stories, driven by curiosities |publisher=DNA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/dhairya-dands-journey-from-nashik-to-mit-media-lab-a-dedication-to-hard-work/articleshow/34762675.cms | title=Dhairya Dand's journey from Nashik to MIT Media Lab a dedication to hard work  |publisher=Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dand has also worked on several accessibility related inventions for emotional communication, autism and motor impairment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/f49p7l2c1nngp80/Jellow.pdf?dl=0 | title=Enablers for the Disabled |publisher=Times |format=PDF |access-date=January 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psfk.com/2014/09/media-consumption-device-mit-flip-shake.html | title=Media Consumption Device Lets You Flip and Shake to Alter News Perspectives |publisher=PSFK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4312">'''Dye-n-Pry''', also called '''Dye And Pry''', '''Dye and Pull''', '''Dye Staining''', or '''Dye Penetrant''', is a [[Destructive testing|destructive analysis]] technique used on [[Surface-mount technology|surface mount technology (SMT)]] components to either perform [[failure analysis]] or inspect for [[solder]] joint integrity. It is an application of [[dye penetrant inspection]].

==Method==
Dye-n-Pry is a useful technique in which a [[dye]] penetrant material is used to inspect for interconnect failures in [[Integrated circuit|integrated circuits (IC)]]. This is mostly commonly done on solder joints for [[Ball grid array|ball grid array (BGA)]] components, although in some cases it can be done with other components or samples. The component of interest is submerged in a dye material, such as red steel dye, and placed under vacuum. This allows the dye to flow underneath the component and into any cracks or defects. The dye is then dried in an oven (preferably overnight) to prevent smearing during separation, which could lead to false results. The part of interest is mechanically separated from the [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) and inspected for the presence of dye. Any fracture surface or interface will have dye present, indicating the presence of cracks or open circuits. IPC-TM-650 Method 2.4.53 specifies a process for dye-n-pry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IPC-TM-650 Method 2.4.53. Dye and Pull Test Method (Formerly Known as Dye and Pull)|url=https://www.ipc.org/TM/2.4.53.pdf|format=PDF|website=Ipc.org|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in failure analysis of electronics==
Dye-n-Pry is a useful failure analysis technique to detect cracking or open circuits in BGA solder joints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electroiq.com/blog/2003/01/solder-joint-failure-analysis/|title=Solder joint failure analysis - Solid State Technology|website=Electroiq.com|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has some practical advantages over other destructive techniques, such as [[Cross section (electronics)|cross sectioning]], as it can inspect a full ball grid array which may consist of hundreds of solder joints. Cross sectioning, on the other hand, may only be able to inspect a single row of solder joints and requires a better initial idea of the failure site.

Dye-n-pry can be useful for detecting several different failure modes. This includes [[pad cratering]] or solder joint fracture from [[Shock (mechanics)|mechanical drop/shock]], [[thermal shock]], or [[Temperature cycling|thermal cycling]]. This makes it useful technique to incorporate into a reliability test plan as part of the post test failure inspection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resources.dfrsolutions.com/Reliable-Test-Plan-Development-Using-Physics-of-Failure.pdf|format=PDF|title=Effective Reliability Test Plan Development using Physics of Failure|website=Resources.dfrsolutions.com|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a useful method to inspect or diagnose failures due to manufacturing defects or design flaws. This includes defects such as [[Electroless nickel immersion gold|black pad]] for PCBs with [[Electroless nickel immersion gold|ENIG]] surface finishes or early failures due to excessive board flexure from depaneling or In-circuit test (ICT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smta.org/chapters/files/Boston_Optimizing-Board-Assembly-Process-DfR-2015-06-03.pdf|format=PDF|title=Optimizing the Board Assembly Process|website=Smta.org|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/Webinar%20Slides%20for%20YouTube/Avoiding-Pad-Cratering-and-Cracked-Capacitor-Webinar.pdf|format=PDF|title=Best Practices in Avoiding Pad Cratering and Capacitor Cracking|website=Dfrsolutions.com|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ectogenesis''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ecto'', "outer," and ''[[wikt:genesis|genesis]]'') is the growth of an organism in an artificial environment&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/ectogenesis yourdictionary.com &gt; ectogenesis] In turn citing: Webster's New World College Dictionary, 2010 by Wiley Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; outside the body in which it would normally be found, such as the growth of an [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] outside the mother's body, or the growth of bacteria outside the body of a host.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/Ectogenesis ectogenesis]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved September 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by British scientist [[J.B.S. Haldane]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Artificial Wombs Are Coming, but the Controversy Is Already Here |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/artificial-wombs-are-coming-and-the-controversys-already-here |work=Motherboard |date=4 August 2014 |accessdate=16 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=ECTOGENESIS: A REPLY TO SINGER AND WELLS|first=DAVID N.|last=JAMES|date=1 January 1987|journal=Bioethics|volume=1|issue=1|pages=80–99|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.1987.tb00006.x|pmid = 11649763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human embryos and fetuses==
{{Further|Artificial uterus}}
Ectogenesis of human embryos and fetuses would require an [[artificial uterus]]. An artificial uterus would have to be supplied by nutrients and oxygen from some source to nurture a fetus, as well as dispose of waste material. There would likely be a need for an interface between such a supplier, filling this function of the [[placenta]]. An artificial uterus, as a replacement organ, could be used to assist women with damaged, diseased or removed uteri to avail the fetus to be conceived to term. It also has the potential to move the threshold of fetal viability to a much earlier stage of pregnancy. This would have implications for the ongoing controversy regarding human [[reproductive rights]].

Ectogenesis could also be a means by which [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] and single men could have genetic offspring without the use of [[surrogate pregnancy]] or a [[sperm donor]], and allow women to have children without going through the pregnancy cycle.

==Bioethical considerations==
The development of artificial uteri and ectogenesis raises a few [[bioethics|bioethical]] and legal considerations, and also has important implications for [[reproductive rights]] and the [[abortion debate]].

Artificial uteri may expand the range of [[fetal viability]], raising questions about the role that fetal viability plays within [[abortion law]]. Within severance theory, for example, abortion rights only include the right to remove the fetus, and do not always extend to the termination of the fetus. If transferring the fetus from a woman's womb to an artificial uterus is possible, the choice to terminate a pregnancy in this way could provide an alternative to aborting the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Randall|first=Vernellia|author2=Randall, Tshaka C.|title=Built in Obsolescence: The Coming End to the Abortion Debate|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|date=22 March 2008|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1112367|url=https://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=vernellia_randall}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chessen|first1=Matt|title=Artificial Wombs Could Outlaw Abortion|url=http://www.mattlesnake.com/2013/03/02/artificial-wombs-could-outlaw-abortion/|website=Mattlesnake.com|date=2013-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also theoretical concerns that children who develop in an artificial uterus may lack "some essential bond with their mothers that other children have";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smajdor|first=Anna|title=The Moral Imperative for Ectogenesis|journal=Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics|date=Summer 2007|volume=16|issue=3|pages=336–45|pmid=17695628|url=http://annasmajdor.me.uk/ectogenesis_final.pdf|doi=10.1017/s0963180107070405}}&lt;/ref&gt; a secondary issue to woman's rights over their own body.

In the 1970 book ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]'', feminist [[Shulamith Firestone]] wrote that differences in biological reproductive roles are a source of [[gender inequality]]. Firestone singled out pregnancy and childbirth, making the argument that an artificial womb would free "women from the tyranny of their reproductive biology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chemaly|first=Soraya|title=What Do Artificial Wombs Mean for Women?|url=http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2012/02/23/what-do-artificial-wombs-mean-women/|newspaper=RH Reality Check|date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=Christine|title=Why Not Artificial Wombs?|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/docLib/TNA03-Rosen.pdf|newspaper=The New Atlantis|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emergency psychiatry''' is the clinical application of [[psychiatry]] in [[emergency medicine|emergency]] settings.&lt;ref name=Currier/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; Conditions requiring psychiatric interventions may include [[failed suicide attempt|attempted suicide]], [[substance abuse]], [[clinical depression|depression]], [[psychosis]], violence or other rapid [[behavior|changes in behavior]]. Psychiatric emergency services are rendered by professionals in the fields of [[medicine]], [[nursing]], [[psychology]] and [[social work]].&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; The demand for emergency psychiatric services has rapidly increased throughout the [[world]] since the 1960s, especially in [[urban area]]s.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lipton/&gt; Care for patients in situations involving emergency psychiatry is complex.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

Individuals may arrive in psychiatric emergency service settings through their own voluntary request, a referral from another health professional, or through [[involuntary commitment]]. Care of patients requiring psychiatric intervention usually encompasses crisis stabilization of many serious and potentially life-threatening conditions which could include acute or chronic [[mental illness|mental disorders]] or symptoms similar to those conditions.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

==Definition==
Symptoms and conditions behind psychiatric emergencies may include [[parasuicide|attempted]] [[suicide]], [[substance dependence]], [[alcohol intoxication]], acute [[clinical depression|depression]], presence of [[delusion]]s, violence, [[panic attack]]s, and significant, rapid changes in behavior.&lt;ref name=ClercqLamarreVergouwen&gt;De Clercq, M.; Lamarre, S.; Vergouwen, H. (1998). ''Emergency Psychiatry and Mental Health Policty: An International Point of View''. New York: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; Emergency psychiatry exists to identify and/or [[treatment of mental illness|treat]] these symptoms and psychiatric conditions. In addition, several rapidly lethal medical conditions present themselves with common psychiatric symptoms. A [[physician]]'s or a [[nurse]]'s ability to identify and intervene with these and other medical conditions is critical.&lt;ref name=Currier&gt;Currier, G.W. ''New Developments in Emergency Psychiatry: Medical, Legal, and Economic''. (1999). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Delivery of services==
The place where emergency psychiatric services are delivered are most commonly referred to as Psychiatric Emergency Services, Psychiatric Emergency Care Centers, or Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Programs. [[Mental health professional]]s from a wide area of disciplines, including [[medicine]], [[nursing]], [[psychology]], and [[social work]] in these settings alongside [[psychiatrist]]s and emergency [[physician]]s.&lt;ref name=Hillard&gt;Hillard, R. &amp; Zitek, B. (2004). ''Emergency Psychiatry''. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; The facilities, sometimes housed in a [[psychiatric hospital]], psychiatric ward, or [[emergency department]], provide immediate treatment to both voluntary and involuntary patients [[24 hours a day, 7 days a week]].&lt;ref name=USNews&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=US News &amp; World Report |accessdate=2007-07-15 |title=Glossary |url=http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/hospitals/articles/glossary.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SFNAMI&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=NAMI-San Francisco |accessdate=2007-07-15 |title=Crisis Service |url=http://www.namisf.org/crisis-serv.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710103126/http://www.namisf.org/crisis-serv.html |archivedate=2007-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a protected environment, psychiatric emergency services exist to provide brief stay of two or three days to gain a diagnostic clarity, find appropriate alternatives to psychiatric hospitalization for the patient, and to treat those patients whose symptoms can be improved within that brief period of time.&lt;ref name=AllenM&gt;Allen, M.H. (1995). ''The Growth and Specialization of Emergency Psychiatry''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Even precise psychiatric diagnoses are a secondary priority compared with interventions in a crisis setting.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; The functions of psychiatric emergency services are to assess patients' problems, implement a short-term treatment consisting of no more than ten meetings with the patient, procure a 24-hour holding area, mobilize teams to carry out interventions at patients' residences, utilize emergency management services to prevent further crises, be aware of inpatient and outpatient psychiatric resources, and provide 24/7 [[telephone counseling]].&lt;ref name=Hillard2&gt;Hillard, J.R. (1990). ''Manual of Clinical Emergency Psychiatry''. Washington D.C.: American Psychiatric Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
Since the 1960s the demand for emergency psychiatric services has endured a rapid growth due to [[deinstitutionalization]] both in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]]. Deinstitutionalization, in some locations, has resulted in a larger number of severely mentally ill people living in the community.  There have been increases in the number of medical specialties, and the multiplication of transitory treatment options, such as [[psychiatric medication]].&lt;ref name=Bassuk&gt;Bassuk, E.L. &amp; Birk, A.W. (1984). ''Emergency Psychiatry: Concepts, Methods, and Practices''. New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lipton&gt;Lipton, F.R. &amp; Goldfinger, S.M. (1985). ''Emergency Psychiatry at the Crossroads''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hedges&gt;Hedges, D. &amp; Burchfield, C. (2006). ''Mind, Brain, and Drug: An Introduction to Psychopharmacology''. Boston: Pearson Education.&lt;/ref&gt; The actual number of psychiatric emergencies has also increased significantly, especially in psychiatric emergency service settings located in [[urban area]]s.&lt;ref name=ClercqLamarreVergouwen/&gt;

Emergency psychiatry has involved the evaluation and treatment of unemployed, homeless and other disenfranchised populations. Emergency psychiatry services have sometimes been able to offer accessibility, convenience, and anonymity.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt; While many of the patients who have used psychiatric emergency services shared common sociological and demographic characteristics, the symptoms and needs expressed have not conformed to any single psychiatric profile.&lt;ref name=Gerson&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerson S, Bassuk E |title=Psychiatric emergencies: an overview |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=137 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |year=1980 |pmid=6986089|doi=10.1176/ajp.137.1.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The individualized care needed for patients utilizing psychiatric emergency services is evolving, requiring an always changing and sometimes complex treatment approach.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

==Scope==

===Suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts===
As of 2000, the [[World Health Organization]] estimated one million suicides in the world each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/suicideprevent/en/ |publisher=World Health Organization |title=Suicide prevention (SUPRE) |accessdate=2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are countless more suicide attempts. Psychiatric emergency service settings exist to treat the mental disorders associated with an increased risk of completed suicide or suicide attempts. Mental health professionals in these settings are expected to predict acts of violence patients may commit against themselves (or others), even though the complex factors leading to a suicide can stem from  many sources, including psychosocial, biological, interpersonal, anthropological, and religious. These mental health professionals will use any resources available to them to determine risk factors, make an overall assessment, and decide on any necessary treatment.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

===Violent behavior===
Aggression can be the result of both internal and external factors that create a measurable activation in the [[autonomic nervous system]]. This activation can become evident through symptoms such as the clenching of fists or jaw, pacing, slamming doors, hitting palms of hands with fists, or being easily startled. It is estimated that 17% of visits to psychiatric emergency service settings are [[homicide|homicidal]] in origin and an additional 5% involve both suicide and homicide.&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hughes DH |title=Suicide and violence assessment in psychiatry |journal=General hospital psychiatry |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=416–21 |year=1996 |pmid=8937907 |doi= 10.1016/S0163-8343(96)00037-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence is also associated with many conditions such as acute intoxication, acute psychosis, [[paranoid personality disorder]], [[antisocial personality disorder]], [[narcissistic personality disorder]] and [[borderline personality disorder]]. Additional risk factors have also been identified which may lead to violent behavior. Such risk factors may include prior arrests, presence of hallucinations, delusions or other neurological impairment, being uneducated, unmarried, etc.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; Mental health professionals complete violence risk assessments to determine both security measures and treatments for the patient.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

===Psychosis===
Patients with [[psychotic]] symptoms are common in psychiatric emergency service settings. The determination of the source of the psychosis can be difficult.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; Sometimes patients brought into the setting in a psychotic state have been disconnected from their previous treatment plan. While the psychiatric emergency service setting will not be able to provide long term care for these types of patients, it can exist to provide a brief respite and reconnect the patient to their case manager and/or reintroduce necessary psychiatric medication. A visit to a crisis unit by a patient suffering from a chronic mental disorder may also indicate the existence of an undiscovered precipitant, such as change in the lifestyle of the individual, or a shifting medical condition. These considerations can play a part in an improvement to an existing treatment plan.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

An individual could also be suffering from an acute onset of psychosis. Such conditions can be prepared for diagnosis by obtaining a medical or psychopathological history of a patient, performing a [[mental status examination]], conducting [[psychological testing]], obtaining [[neuroimaging|neuroimages]], and obtaining other neurophysiologic measurements. Following this, the mental health professional can perform a [[differential diagnosis]] and prepare the patient for treatment. As with other patient care considerations, the origins of acute psychosis can be difficult to determine because of the mental state of the patient. However, acute psychosis is classified as a medical emergency requiring immediate and complete attention. The lack of identification and treatment can result in suicide, homicide, or other violence.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

===Substance dependence, abuse and intoxication===
[[Image:Psychoactive Drugs.jpg|right|thumb|Illicit [[psychoactive drugs]], a cause of psychotic symptoms.]]
Another common cause of psychotic symptoms is substance intoxication. These acute symptoms may resolve after a period of observation or limited psychopharmacological treatment. However the underlying issues, such as substance dependence or abuse, is difficult to treat in the emergency department, as it is a long term condition.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Both acute [[alcohol intoxication]] as well as other forms of substance abuse can require psychiatric interventions.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt; Acting as a [[depressant]] of the [[central nervous system]], the early effects of [[ethanol|alcohol]] are usually desired for and characterized by increased talkativeness, giddiness, and a loosening of social inhibitions. Besides considerations of impaired concentration, verbal and motor performance, insight, judgment and short term memory loss which could result in behavioral change causing injury or death, levels of alcohol below 60 milligrams per deciliter of blood are usually considered non-lethal. However, individuals at 200 milligrams per deciliter of blood are considered grossly intoxicated and concentration levels at 400 milligrams per deciliter of blood are lethal, causing complete [[anesthesia]] of the [[respiratory system]].&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

Beyond the dangerous behavioral changes that occur after the consumption of certain amounts of alcohol, idiosyncratic intoxication could occur in some individuals even after the consumption of relatively small amounts of alcohol. Episodes of this impairment usually consist of confusion, disorientation, delusions and visual [[hallucination]]s, increased aggressiveness, rage, agitation and violence. Chronic [[alcoholic]]s may also suffer from alcoholic hallucinosis, wherein the cessation of prolonged drinking may trigger auditory hallucinations. Such episodes can last for a few hours or an entire week. [[Antipsychotic]]s are often used to treat these symptoms.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

Patients may also be treated for substance abuse following the [[route of administration|administration]] of psychoactive substances containing [[amphetamine]], [[caffeine]], [[tetrahydrocannabinol]], [[cocaine]], [[phencyclidine]]s, or other [[inhalant]]s, [[opioid]]s, [[sedative]]s, [[hypnotic]]s, [[anxiolytic]]s, [[psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants]]. Clinicians assessing and treating substance abusers must establish therapeutic rapport to counter [[denial]] and other negative attitudes directed towards treatment. In addition, the clinician must determine substances used, the route of administration, dosage, and time of last use to determine the necessary short and long term treatments. An appropriate choice of treatment setting must also be determined. These settings may include outpatient facilities, partial hospitals, residential treatment centers, or hospitals. Both the immediate and long term treatment and setting is determined by the severity of dependency and seriousness of physiological complications arising from the abuse.&lt;ref name= Hillard/&gt;

===Hazardous drug reactions and interactions===
[[Drug overdose|Overdoses]], [[drug interaction]]s, and dangerous reactions from psychiatric medications, especially antipsychotics, are considered psychiatric emergencies. [[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] is a potentially lethal complication of first or second generation antipsychotics.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; If untreated, neuroleptic malignant syndrome can result in fever, muscle rigidity, confusion, unstable vital signs, or even death.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; [[Serotonin syndrome]] can result when [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s or [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s mix with [[buspirone]].&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; Severe symptoms of serotonin syndrome include [[hyperthermia]], delirium, and [[tachycardia]] that may lead to shock. Often patients with severe general medical symptoms, such as unstable vital signs, will be transferred to a general medical emergency department or medicine service for increased monitoring.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

===Personality disorders===
Disorders manifesting dysfunction in areas related to [[cognition]], [[affect (psychology)|affectivity]], interpersonal functioning and impulse control can be considered [[personality disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=DSM&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: Fourth Edition''. Washington D.C.: American Psychiatric Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Patients suffering from a personality disorder will usually not complain about symptoms resulting from their disorder. Patients suffering an emergency phase of a personality disorder may showcase combative or suspicious behavior, suffer from brief psychotic episodes, or be delusional. Compared with outpatient settings and the general population, the prevalence of individuals suffering from personality disorders in inpatient psychiatric settings is usually 7–25% higher. Clinicians working with such patients attempt to stabilize the individual to their baseline level of function.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

===Anxiety===
Patients suffering from an extreme case of [[anxiety]] may seek treatment when all support systems have been exhausted and they are unable to bear the anxiety. Feelings of anxiety may present in different ways from an underlying medical illness or psychiatric disorder, a secondary functional disturbance from another psychiatric disorder, from a primary psychiatric disorder such as [[panic disorder]] or [[generalized anxiety disorder]], or as a result of stress from such conditions as [[adjustment disorder]] or [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Clinicians usually attempt to first provide a "safe harbor" for the patient so that assessment processes and treatments can be adequately facilitated.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt; The initiation of treatments for mood and anxiety disorders are important as patients suffering from anxiety disorders have a higher risk of premature death.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

===Disasters===
[[Natural disaster]]s and [[man-made hazards]] can cause severe psychological stress in victims surrounding the event. [[Emergency management]] often includes psychiatric emergency services designed to help victims cope with the situation. The impact of disasters can cause people to feel shocked, overwhelmed, immobilized, panic-stricken, or confused. Hours, days, months and even years after a disaster, individuals can experience tormenting memories, vivid nightmares, develop apathy, withdrawal, memory lapses, fatigue, loss of appetite, insomnia, depression, irritability, panic attacks, or dysphoria.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

Due to the typically disorganized and hazardous environment following a disaster, mental health professionals typically assess and treat patients as rapidly as possible. Unless a condition is threatening life of the patient, or others around the patient, other medical and basic survival considerations are managed first. Soon after a disaster clinicians may make themselves available to allow individuals to ventilate to relieve feelings of isolation, helplessness and vulnerability. Dependent upon the scale of the disaster, many victims may suffer from both chronic or acute [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Patients suffering severely from this disorder often are admitted to psychiatric hospitals to stabilize the individual.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

===Abuse===
Incidents of [[physical abuse]], [[sexual abuse]] or [[rape]] can result in dangerous outcomes to the victim of the criminal act. Victims may suffer from extreme anxiety, fear, helplessness, confusion, eating or sleeping disorders, hostility, guilt and shame. Managing the response usually encompasses coordinating psychological, medical and legal considerations. Dependent upon legal requirements in the region, mental health professionals may be required to report criminal activity to a police force. Mental health professionals will usually gather identifying data during the initial assessment and refer the patient, if necessary, to receive medical treatment. Medical treatment may include a [[physical examination]], collection of medicolegal evidence, and determination of the risk of [[pregnancy]], if applicable.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatments in psychiatric emergency service settings are typically transitory in nature and only exist to provide dispositional solutions and/or to stabilize life-threatening conditions.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt; Once stabilized, patients suffering chronic conditions may be transferred to a setting which can provide long term [[psychiatric rehabilitation]].&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt; Prescribed treatments within the emergency service setting vary dependent upon the patient's condition.&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;Walker, J.I. (1983) ''Psychiatric Emergencies''. Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott.&lt;/ref&gt; Different forms of psychiatric medication, [[psychotherapy]], or [[electroconvulsive therapy]] may be used in the emergency setting.&lt;ref name= Walker/&gt;&lt;ref name=RundHutzler&gt;Rund, D.A, &amp; Hutzler, J.C. (1983). ''Emergency Psychiatry''. St. Louis: The C.V. Mosby Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Potter&gt;Potter, M. (2007, May 31).

Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction and efficacy of psychiatric medication as a treatment option in psychiatry has reduced the utilization of physical restraints in emergency settings, by reducing dangerous symptoms resulting from acute exacerbation of mental illness or substance intoxication.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt;

===Medications===
With time as a critical aspect of emergency psychiatry, the rapidity of effect is an important consideration.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt; [[Pharmacokinetics]] is the movement of drugs through the body with time and is at least partially reliant upon the [[route of administration]], [[absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorption]], [[distribution (pharmacology)|distribution]] and [[metabolism]] of the medication.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt;&lt;ref name=HolfordSheiner&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Holford N.H.G |author2=Sheiner L.B. | year = 1981 | title = Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling in vivo | url = | journal = CRC Critical Reviews in Bioengineering | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 273–322 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common route of administration is oral administration, however if this method is to work the drug must be able to get to the stomach and stay there.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; In cases of [[vomiting]] and nausea this method of administration is not an option. [[Suppositories]] can, in some situations, be administered instead.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; Medication can also be administered through [[intramuscular injection]], or through [[intravenous therapy|intravenous injection]].&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt;

The amount of time required for absorption varies dependent upon many factors including drug [[solubility]], gastrointestinal [[motility]] and [[pH]].&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; If a medication is administered orally the amount of [[food]] in the stomach may also affect the rate of absorption.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; Once absorbed medications must be distributed throughout the body, or usually with the case of psychiatric medication, past the [[blood–brain barrier]] to the [[brain]].&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; With all of these factors affecting the rapidity of effect, the time until the effects are evident varies. Generally, though, the timing with medications is relatively fast and can occur within several minutes. As an example, physicians usually expect to see a remission of symptoms thirty minutes after [[haloperidol]], an antipsychotic, is administered intramuscularly.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt; [[Antipsychotics]], especially [[Haloperidol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=3298219|year=2012|author1=Wilson|first1=M. P.|title=The Psychopharmacology of Agitation: Consensus Statement of the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry Project BETA Psychopharmacology Workgroup|journal=Western Journal of Emergency Medicine|volume=13|issue=1|pages=26–34|last2=Pepper|first2=D|last3=Currier|first3=G. W.|last4=Holloman Jr|first4=G. H.|last5=Feifel|first5=D|doi=10.5811/westjem.2011.9.6866|pmid=22461918}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as assorted [[benzodiazepines]] are the most frequently used drugs in emergency psychiatry, especially agitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=2507712|year=2008|author1=Wilhelm|first1=S|title=Use of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines in patients with psychiatric emergencies: Results of an observational trial|journal=BMC Psychiatry|volume=8|pages=61|last2=Schacht|first2=A|last3=Wagner|first3=T|doi=10.1186/1471-244X-8-61|pmid=18647402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychotherapy===
Other treatment methods may be used in psychiatric emergency service settings. [[Brief therapy|Brief psychotherapy]] can be used to treat acute conditions or immediate problems as long as the patient understands his or her issues are psychological, the patient trusts the physician, the physician can encourage hope for change, the patient has motivation to change, the physician is aware of the psychopathological history of the patient, and the patient understands that their confidentiality will be respected.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt; The process of brief therapy under emergency psychiatric conditions includes the establishment of a primary complaint from the patient, realizing psychosocial factors, formulating an accurate representation of the problem, coming up with ways to solve the problem, and setting specific goals.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt; The information gathering aspect of brief psychotherapy is therapeutic because it helps the patient place his or her problem in the proper perspective.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt; If the physician determines that deeper psychotherapy sessions are required, he or she can transition the patient out of the emergency setting and into an appropriate clinic or center.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt;

===ECT===
[[Electroconvulsive therapy]] is a controversial form of treatment which [[5150 (Involuntary psychiatric hold)#Additional rights|cannot be involuntarily applied]] in psychiatric emergency service settings.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Potter/&gt; Instances wherein a patient is depressed to such a severe degree that the patient cannot be stopped from hurting himself or herself or when a patient refuses to swallow, eat or drink medication, electroconvulsive therapy could be suggested as a therapeutic alternative.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt; While preliminary research suggests that electroconvulsive therapy may be an effective treatment for depression, it usually requires a course of six to twelve sessions of convulsions lasting at least 20 seconds for those antidepressant effects to occur.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt;

==Observation and collateral information==
There are other essential aspects of emergency psychiatry: observation and collateral information. The observation of the patient's behavior is an important aspect of emergency psychiatry inasmuch as it allows the clinicians working with the patient to estimate prognosis and improvements/declines in condition. Many jurisdictions base involuntary commitment on dangerousness or the inability to care for one's basic needs. Observation for a period of time may help determine this. For example, if a patient who is committed for violent behavior in the community, continues to behave in an erratic manner without clear purpose, this will help the staff decide that hospital admission may be needed.

Collateral information or parallel information is information obtained from family, friends or treatment providers of the patient. Some jurisdictions require consent from the patient to obtain this information while others do not. For example, with a patient who is thought to be paranoid about people following him or spying on him, this information can be helpful discern if these thoughts are more or less likely to be based in reality. Past episodes of suicide attempts or violent behavior can be confirmed or disproven.

==Disposition==
Patient receive emergency services often on a time limited basis such as 24 or 72 hours. After this time, and sometimes earlier, the staff must decide the next place for the patient to receive services. This is referred to as disposition. This is one of the essential features of emergency psychiatry.

===Hospital admission===
[[Image:EmergencyPsychiatryProcess.PNG|thumb|right|The emergency care process.]]
The staff will need to determine if the patient needs to be admitted to a psychiatric inpatient facility or if they can be safely discharged to the community after a period of observation and/or brief treatment.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Initial emergency psychiatric evaluations usually involve patients who are acutely agitated, [[paranoid]], or who are suicidal. Initial evaluations to determine admission and interventions are designed to be as therapeutic as possible.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

====Involuntary commitment====
[[Involuntary commitment]], or sectioning, refers to situations where [[police officer]]s, health officers, or [[Health care provider|health professionals]] classify an individual as dangerous to themselves, others, [[5150 (Involuntary psychiatric hold)#5150 criteria|gravely disabled]], or mentally ill according to the applicable government law for the region. After an individual is transported to a psychiatric emergency service setting, a preliminary professional assessment is completed which may or may not result in [[involuntary treatment]].&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; Some patients may be discharged shortly after being brought to psychiatric emergency services while others will require longer observation and the need for continued involuntary commitment will exist. While some patients may initially come voluntarily, it may be realized that they pose a risk to themselves or others and involuntary commitment may be initiated at that point.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

====Referrals and voluntary hospitalization====
In some locations, such as the United States, voluntary hospitalizations are outnumbered by involuntary commitments partly due to the fact that insurance tends not to pay for hospitalization unless an imminent danger exists to the individual or community. In addition, psychiatric emergency service settings admit approximately one third of patients from [[assertive community treatment]] centers.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; Therefore, patients who are not admitted will be referred to services in the community.

'''Four Treasures of the Study''', '''Four Jewels of the Study''' or '''Four Friends of the Study''' is an expression used to denote the [[ink brush|brush]], [[inkstick|ink]], [[Xuan paper|paper]] and [[ink stone]] used in [[Chinese calligraphy|Chinese]] and other [[East Asia]]n calligraphic traditions.  The name appears to originate in the time of the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] (420–589 AD).&lt;ref name="ctoday"&gt;Chinesetoday.com.

==Four Treasures==
Chinese culture is very fond of [[Chengyu|four word couplets]], and the '''Four Treasures''' is another example: "文房四寶: 筆、墨、紙、硯," (Pinyin: ''wén fáng sì bǎo: bǐ, mò, zhǐ, yàn'') "''The four jewels of the study: Brush, Ink, Paper, Inkstone.''"&lt;ref name="ctoday" /&gt;&lt;ref name="big5x"&gt;Big5.xinhuanet.com. "[http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/www.godpp.gov.cn/yxzp_/2007-10/23/content_11468094.htm Big5.xinhuanet.com]." ''走近文房四寶.'' Retrieved on 2010-11-27.&lt;/ref&gt; In the couplet mentioned, each of the '''Treasures''' is referred to by a single [[epithet]]; however, each of these are usually known by a compound name (''i.e.'' The Brush: 毛筆, literally "''hair brush/pen''). The individual treasures have a "treasured" form, each being produced in certain areas of China as a speciality for those scholars who would use them.These are called the 4 SPECIAL Treasures of the Study.

===Brush===
{{Main|Ink brush}}

[[File:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - calligraphy brush with dragon design.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|A highly decorative badger hair brush dating to the [[Ming Dynasty]].]] The brush ({{zh|t=毛筆|s=毛笔|p=máo bǐ}}) is the oldest '''Four Treasures''' member, with archaeological evidence dating to [[Zhou dynasty]] (1045 BC–256 BC) illustrations on ancient bones. The oldest brush so far dates to [[Han dynasty]] (202 BC–220 AD). Brushes are generally made from animal hair, or —in certain situations—the first hair taken from a baby's head (said to bring good luck in the [[Imperial examinations]]). Brush handles are commonly constructed from [[bamboo]], but special brushes may have handles of [[sandalwood]], [[jade]], carved bone/ivory, or other precious materials.

Modern brushes are primarily white goat hair (羊毫), black rabbit hair (紫毫), yellow weasel hair (黄鼠毫/狼毫), or a combination mix. Ancient brushes, and some of the more valuable ones available on the market may be made with the hair of any number of different types of animals. Each type of hair has a specific ink capacity, giving distinct brush strokes. Different brushes are used for different styles of calligraphy and writing.

Brushes are classed as soft (軟毫), mixed (兼毫) or hard (硬毫).  Hair is laboriously sorted by softness, hardness, thickness, &amp; length, then bundled for specific uses. The most famous and highly prized brushes are a mix of yellow weasel, goat and rabbit hair, known as Húbǐ (湖筆); highly prized since the [[Ming dynasty]] (late 14th century) they are currently made in [[Shanlian]] (善琏), a town in the [[Nanxun District]], [[prefecture-level city]] of [[Huzhou]], of [[Zhejiang province]] (浙江).

===Ink===
{{Main|Inkstick}}

[[File:Inkstick.jpg|upright|thumb|An inkstick made in the form of lotus leaves and flowers.]]The Inkstick (Chinese: 墨 pinyin: ''{{audio|Zh-mò.ogg|mò|help=no}}'') is an artificial ink developed during the [[Han dynasty]]. These first writing inks were based on naturally occurring minerals like [[graphite]] and [[vermilion]]; earliest inks were probably liquids and not preserved. Modern inksticks are generally made of soots from one of three different sources, including [[lacquer]] [[soot]], [[pine]] soot, and [[oil]] soot. Soots are collected, then mixed with glue. Higher quality inksticks also use powdered spices and herbs, adding to aroma and providing some protection to the ink itself.  The glue, soot, and spice mixture is then pressed into shape and allowed to dry. This process can take 6 weeks, depending on an inkstick's dimensions.

The best ink sticks are fine grained and have a light, slightly ringing sound when tapped. They are often decorated with poems, calligraphy, or [[bas relief]], and painted. These particular articles are highly collectable, and often acquired like stamps. The inksticks in highest regard, known as Huīmò (徽墨), contain [[musk]], [[borneol]] and other precious [[aromatics]] of [[Chinese medicine]]. They are still produced today in [[She County, Anhui|Shexian]] (歙县) in [[Anhui province]] (安徽).

===Paper===
{{Main|Xuan Paper}}

[[File:Treatise On Calligraphy.jpg|thumb|upright|A detail from ''The Treatise on Calligraphy'' by [[Sun Guoting]] (646–691). Ink on Paper.]]Paper (Chinese: ''traditional'' 紙, ''simplified'' 纸; Pinyin: ''{{audio|Zh-zhǐ.ogg|zhǐ|help=no}}'') was first developed in China in the first decade of 100 AD. Previous to its invention, bamboo slips and silks were used for writing material. Several methods of paper production developed over the centuries in China. However, the paper which was considered of highest value was that of the Jingxian (泾县) in Anhui province.

This particular form of paper, known as Xuānzhǐ (宣紙), is soft, fine-textured, moth resistant, has a high tensile strength, and remarkable longevity for such a product – so much so that it has a reputation for lasting "1,000 years". The quality of the paper depends on the processing methods used to produce it. Paper may be unprocessed, half processed or processed. The processing determines how well ink or paint is absorbed into the fibre of the paper, as well as the stiffness of the paper itself. Unprocessed papers are very absorbent and quite malleable, whereas processed papers are far more resistant to absorption and are stiffer.

===Inkstone===
{{Main|Inkstone}}

[[File:Duan Inkstone.JPG|left|thumb|A Duan Inkstone in the shape of a pond.]]The inkstone (Chinese: ''traditional'' 硯 or 硯臺; ''simplified'' 砚 or 砚台; Pinyin: ''{{audio|Zh-yàn.ogg|yàn|help=no}}'' or ''yàn tái'') is used to grind the ink stick into powder. This powder is then mixed with water in a well in the inkstone in order to produce usable ink for calligraphy. The most ideal water for use in ink is slightly salty. Ink was first prepared using a mortar and pestle, but with the advent of inksticks this method slowly vanished. The stone used is generally of a relatively fine whetstone type.

The earliest known inkstones date back to the [[Han dynasty]]. The production of inkstones reached its zenith in the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song dynasties]] with inkstones becoming extremely intricate works of art. The most highly sought-after inkstones originated in four different locations in China. Duanshi stones (端石硯) from Duanxi in [[Guangdong]], She stones (歙硯) from [[She County, Anhui|Shexian]] in [[Anhui]], Taohe stones (洮河硯) from the [[Tao River]] in South [[Gansu]] and Chengni ceramic stones (澄泥硯) which are manufactured by a process which is said to have been developed in [[Luoyang]] in [[Henan]].

==Tools of the Scholar==
Classical scholars had more than just the '''Four treasures''' in their studies. The other "Treasures" include the [[brush-holder]] (笔架), brush-hanger (笔挂), paperweights (镇纸), the brush-rinsing pot (笔洗), and the [[Seal (East Asia)|seal]] (圖章) and seal-ink (印泥).

For painting, [[Chinese pigment]]s are also used.

Why study theology? With beliefs and religion at the centre of many global conflicts, is there a place for a greater understanding of them? Dr Peter Watts, the undergraduate admissions tutor at Nottingham University’s department of theology and religious studies, believes so.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Stavrakopoulou was secretary of the British-based Society for Old Testament Study in 2011,&lt;ref name=SinghTelegraph_8Mar11/&gt; and member of the European Association of Biblical Studies and of the US-based [[Society of Biblical Literature]].&lt;ref name=SinghTelegraph_8Mar11/&gt;

Stavrakopoulou has appeared on several occasions in [[BBC One]]'s programme featuring "moral, ethical and religious debates," ''[[The Big Questions]]'' hosted by [[Nicky Campbell]]; appearances include on the topics "Is the Bible still relevant?",

Stavrakopoulou has served as writer and presenter for a number of media productions relating to her scholarly interests. She contributed to [[Channel 4]]'s series ''The Bible: A History'' (2010), regarding the historicity of [[Moses]].&lt;ref name=SinghTelegraph_8Mar11/&gt; Her first primetime presentation was a three-part television series for the [[BBC2]] ''The Bible's Buried Secrets'' (2011;&lt;ref name=SinghTelegraph_8Mar11/&gt;&lt;ref name = RobertsRevoir_9Mar11/&gt; not to be confused with [[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]]'s 2008 [[The Bible's Buried Secrets|programme of the same name]]).&lt;ref name=SinghTelegraph_8Mar11/&gt;

These popular presentations, while being widely presented (e.g., the [[BBC2]] production has been appearing in the U.S. as an offering of [[PBS]] stations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wycc.org/schedule/#page=search&amp;day=20160330&amp;provider=Broadcast&amp;search=Did%20King%20David's%20Empire%20Exist%3F&amp;sorted=relevance|title=WYCC PBS Chicago - Schedule|author= WYCC Staff | date= 2016-04-03 | work=WYCC PBS Chicago | access-date=4 April 2016}}{{better source|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2016}}), have met with mixed and some skeptical reviews, both in the U.K. popular press,&lt;ref name=SinghTelegraph_8Mar11/&gt;&lt;ref name = RobertsRevoir_9Mar11/&gt; and more broadly.&lt;ref name=LucieSmith_23Mar11&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lucie-Smith, Alexander | date = 2011-03-23 | title=Theologians ought to love this BBC series on the Bible. Too bad it gives in to Dan Brown-style silliness | journal = [[The Catholic Herald]] | url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2011/03/23/theologians-ought-to-love-this-bbc-series-on-the-bible-too-bad-it-gives-in-to-dan-brown-style-silliness/ | access-date=17 March 2011 | quote = [Quoting subtitle, etc.] &lt;small&gt;In its closing moments the episode last night gave up fact for opinion. / …in the closing moments of the programme that scholarship seemed to be given up in favour of what was, in fact, mere opinion. First, the doctor suggested that the cult of the angels and the saints in contemporary Christianity was a hangover from polytheism. This is completely false. The Blessed Virgin is not some sort of lineal descendant of Asherah. The Blessed Virgin is a human being, not a goddess; she represents all that humanity is called to be; if she loses her humanity, she would have no appeal to her fellow human beings. But Mary is one of us—that is the whole point of her. Second, the doctor suggested that monotheism presents God as exclusively male, and men thus like God, which leads to the marginalisation and repression of women.With a charge like this, where can one start? The polytheistic Greeks and Romans denied females all political rights, despite the fact that Athens was under the protection of the goddess Athene, and Rome under the protection of Juno. The Julio-Claudian rulers claimed descent from Venus, but were not noted for their feminism. The idea that polytheism is more friendly to women is simply unsupported by the facts. It is easy to claim and sounds good, but as a serious thesis, it deserves to be dismissed. How on earth did it find itself in what purported to be a serious programme about the Bible?&lt;/small&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fr. Alexander Lucie-Smith, consulting editor of ''The Catholic Herald'' and theologian, said that the BBC's ''…Buried Secrets'' series "is the sort of television programme that theologians ought to cherish…".&lt;ref name=LucieSmith_23Mar11/&gt; He complained that in the second episode of the production, which addresses the origins of monotheism, that "…in [its] closing moments… scholarship seemed to be given up in favour of… mere opinion"; he took issue with Stavrakopoulou's suggestion that contemporary Christianity's views of Mary, saints, and angels were a holdover from the polytheistic religions, and that monotheism's presentation of God as exclusively male led to the marginalisation and repression of women.&lt;ref name=LucieSmith_23Mar11/&gt; He argues that the polytheistic Greeks and Romans religions featured female deities, but the cultures themselves denied females all political rights.&lt;ref name=LucieSmith_23Mar11/&gt;

The main focus of  Stavrakopoulou's research is on the Hebrew bible,&lt;ref name=SinghTelegraph_8Mar11/&gt; and on [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Israelite and Judahite history and religion]].&lt;ref name = SelfPublishedCV/&gt;{{third-party inline|date=April 2016}} She describes herself as "an atheist with huge respect for religion" and regards her work as "a branch of history like any other."&lt;ref name = DailyMail_19Mar11&gt;{{cite journal | author = Daily Mail Reporter | date = 2011-03-19 | title =  Was God's wife edited out of the Bible?

[[John Barton (theologian)|John Barton]], Oriel &amp; Laing Professor of Interpretation [of biblical texts] at the [[University of Oxford]], in his ''Ethics in Ancient Israel'', comments thus on the conclusions and general disputes in one area that Stavrakopoulou is writing as theologian and historian:{{quote|[Stavrakopoulou] argues that the idea of the king and his entourage as worshipping in an official way—that is, in practice, in accordance with the kind of religious customs the prophets approved of—while the populace at large indulged in illicit cults, is wishful thinking. A particularly striking example is child sacrifice, which (she has argued) was regarded as normal by everyone in pre-exilic and exilic times, except prophets such as Jeremiah and Ezekial.&lt;ref&gt;On these points, Barton cites Stavrakopoulou's ''King Manasseh'' (2004) and her  "'Popular' Religion and 'Official' Religion: Practice, Perception, Portrayal" (in ''Religious Diversity,'' 2010), unfortunately, without page numbers.&lt;/ref&gt; And indeed the Old Testament itself, while strongly condemning such a practice, makes it abundantly clear that it was very common. The idea that it was popular rather than official reflects Old Testament condemnation, but probably not the reality on the ground at the time. Similarly, polytheism was fairly obviously common in pre-exilic Israel, but there is no particular reason to think it was more common among 'the people' than in the king's palace and, indeed, in the temple. / ''These matters are widely disputed,'' but so-called popular religion may well have been much nearer to official religion…&lt;ref name = BartonEthics2014&gt;{{cite book |  author = Barton, John | year = 2014 | title = Ethics in Ancient Israel | chapter =  | ref =  | location = Oxford, ENG | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0199660433 | pages = 88f  | url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0199660433 | access-date = 3 April 2016 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;While this excerpt is not entirely an independent view—[[John Barton (theologian)|Barton]] is a fellow, more senior [[Oxonian]] who has collaborated with Stavrakopoulous (see '''Books''' subsection above)—it nevertheless indicates, according to this sympathetic colleague, that there is no preponderance of academic opinion on this matter, about which Stavrakopoulous writes (i.e., it is, in Barton's representation, "widely disputed").&lt;/ref&gt; [break in paragraph indicated, emphasis regarding disputed nature of views, added]}}

The '''galactic anticenter''' is a direction in space directly opposite to the [[Galactic Center]], as viewed from [[Earth]]. This direction corresponds to a point on the [[celestial sphere]]. From the perspective of an observer on Earth, the galactic anticenter is located in the constellation [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]], and [[Alnath|Beta Tauri]] is the bright star that appears nearest this point.

In terms of the [[galactic coordinate system]], the Galactic Center (in [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]) corresponds to a longitude of 0°, while the anticenter is located exactly at 180°.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkastronomy.com/M13/Manual/common/galactic_coords.html |title=Galactic Coordinates |publisher=Thinkastronomy.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the anticenter is found at roughly [[right ascension|RA]] 05h 46m, [[declination|dec]] +28° 56'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/G/galactic_anticenter.html |title=Galactic Anticenter on the Internet Encyclopedia of Science |accessdate=2009-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helen Swift Neilson''' (1869 – 1945) was an American writer and art collector.

Neilson was the daughter of the meatpacking entrepreneur [[Gustavus Franklin Swift]]. She became the second wife of the British politician and writer [[Francis Neilson]], with whom she founded the weekly paper ''[[The Freeman]]'' in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3484154 In Memoriam: Helen Swift Neilson], [[The American Journal of Economics and Sociology]], Vol. 4, No. 4 (Jul., 1945), pp. 511-513, on Jstor&lt;/ref&gt;

She is perhaps best known for her book about her parents called ''My Father and My Mother''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/my-father-and-my-mother/oclc/2325376 My Father and My Mother], The Lakeside Press, R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co., Chicago, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;
Neilson died in [[Chicago]].

She bequeathed several notable paintings to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]:

'''''Is Religion Dangerous?''''' is a book by [[Keith Ward]] examining the questions: "Is religion dangerous? Does it do more harm than good? Is it a force for evil?" It was first published in 2006. Looking at the evidence from history, philosophy, sociology and psychology, Ward focuses on the main question at issue: does religion do more harm than good? He begins by examining the key area of [[religious violence|religion and violence]] and goes on to assess the allegations of irrationality and immorality, before exploring the good religion has done over the centuries. He suggests that without religion the human race would be considerably worse off and there would be little hope for the future.

==Summary==
In the '''Introduction: What is religion?''', Ward begins, "Is religion dangerous? Does it do more harm than good? Is it a force for evil, even 'the root of all evil'?"—the title of a [[The Root of All Evil?|short British television series]] presented by [[Richard Dawkins]]. Ward states his view that the assertion that religion does more harm than good ignores "the available evidence from history, from psychology and sociology, and from philosophy" and suggests that proponents of this view "refuse to investigate the question in a properly rigorous way, and substitute rhetoric for analysis".{{sfn|Ward|p=7}}  He suggests that it is impossible to give a satisfactory universal definition of religion, and that early opponents of religion such as [[Edward Taylor]], [[James Frazer]] and [[Émile Durkheim]] were indulging in "scholarly fantazising" about forms of primitive religion which were refuted by more rigorous studies such as ''Theories of Primitive Religion'' by [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard|Evans-Pritchard]]. "Unfortunately some writers have not yet realised this", such as [[Daniel Dennett]] in ''Breaking the Spell'', who "does not seem to realise that the spell was broken as long ago as 1884 when [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E. B. Tylor]] was appointed to a Readership in Anthropology at [[Oxford University]]."{{sfn|Ward|pp=10-11}}

In Chapters 1 through 3, which deal with the origins and nature of violence, Ward suggests that "It is not religion that causes intolerance. It is intolerance that uses religion", that "The leaders of such movements [are] using moral and religious language as a cloak for evil and irreligious ends",{{sfn|Ward|p=38}} and that "religions are not the causes of evil, but they do naturally share in the general moral state of the societies in which they exist".{{sfn|Ward|p=41}} Ward suggests that any organised human activity can be corrupted, and that the corruptions of religion, although highly regrettable, are less harmful that the corruptions of secular ideologies ([[Nazism]], [[Leninism]] and [[Maoism]] all claimed the support of science). In addition the great religions have within themselves a powerful critique of corruption.{{citation needed|reason=The summary does not contain a citation|date=April 2015}} Ward, alluding to [[Islamic terrorism]], alleges that "it is not religion that causes Islamic terrorism. It is a version of Islam that has been corrupted by ...[[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninism]]"{{sfn|Ward|p=59}} and that [[al-Qaeda]] is based on a demonstrably incorrect interpretation of [[Islam]]. He further suggests that wars fought in the name of some interpretations of Christianity have also been based on distortions.{{citation needed|reason=The claim is very specific|date=April 2015}}

Ward examines the interplay of [[reason]], [[morality]], and [[philosophy]] in Chapters 4 through 8. He claims that the statement "the only reasonable beliefs are those that can be confirmed by the methods of science, by public observation, measurement and experiment" is [[Self-refuting idea|self-refuting]].{{sfn|Ward|p=86}}  He contrasts four [[worldview]]s—Common Sense, Materialism, Idealism and Christian Theism—and suggests that there are serious problems with Common Sense (science shows that things are often not in fact as they seem at all) and Materialism ("quantum physics seems to dissolve matter entirely", and "consciousness and the contents of consciousness resist translation into purely physical terms... and if ... truth, beauty and goodness ... are things that really exist ... then Materialism will not match our experience at all"{{sfn|Ward|pp=88-89}}). He suggests that "many attacks on religion are based on the belief that idealism is false. There is no spiritual dimension to reality... to make matters worse, thinkers like [[Richard Dawkins]] hold that...religious views are based on 'blind faith'". But, he asks, "Has Dawkins never read any philosophy?... Does he really think that [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] were all unthinking simpletons?"{{sfn|Ward|p=90}}  "Looking around my philosopher colleagues in Britain, virtually all of whom I know at least from their published work, I would say that very few of them are materialists... the point is that religious views are underpinned by highly sophisticated philosophical arguments".{{sfn|Ward|p=91}} He discusses the defensibility of worldviews and suggests some criteria that make a [[worldview]] reasonable:{{citation needed|reason=Broad outline needs references|date=April 2015}}

# Clarity and precision in stating the beliefs, ideally arranged in order of logical dependence so that one can tell which are the truly basic beliefs
# Comparison with other worldviews
# Testing the adequacy of the worldview to the widest range of data, whether they are experiences or other beliefs

Ward asserts that it is rational, and not harmful, to believe in life after death. He advises that "even for the most conservative Christian, moral rules found in the Bible should not be taken out of context"{{sfn|Ward|p=114}} and that "far from being considered dangerous, religious morality is widely considered to be a valuable resource for moral thinking in the modern world".{{sfn|Ward|p=127}} He explains how his own journey from [[atheism]], when he was a philosopher teaching at [[Glasgow University]], was strongly influenced by the need to have a philosophically coherent justification for morality. Ward avers that the history of Europe from the 16th to the 20th Centuries was not one of "beneficial liberation from fear and superstition" but "an age of increasingly aggressive [[nationalism]] culminating in two [[world war]]s ... [[barbarian|barbarism]] did not decrease. In the twentieth century it reached heights never previously imagined"{{sfn|Ward|pp=141-142}} and that religiously inspired individuals took a leading role in many beneficial developments.{{sfn|Ward|pp=141-142. He cites [[William Wilberforce]], [[Frederick Nolde]], [[Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]], [[Bishop]] [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]], [[Trevor Huddleston]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King]]}} He suggests that "it was religion, and not secular thought, that propounded the view that nature is founded on a deep rationality",{{sfn|Ward|p=142, citing [[Anselm of Canterbury|St Anselm]], [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton]]}} and defends liberalism and pluralism in religious thought, which he attributes to the rise of [[Protestantism]] and contrasts with what he considers the illiberal attitudes of [[Richard Dawkins]]{{sfn|Ward|pp=148-150. Ward states that "the only proper response to [views such as six-day creation] is to present the evidence and engage in open debate. Dawkins chooses to ridicule them instead"}} and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers like [[David Hume]], who sought to make reason the slave of passions.{{sfn|Ward|pp=143-152, referring to Hume's view that "Reason is, and ought only to be, the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them" [''A Treatise of Human Nature'' II.iii.3/415]}}

In Chapters 9 and 10, Ward attempts to demonstrate the benefits of religion. Ward quotes data from [[David Myers (academic)|David Myers]] citing surveys by [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]], the National Opinion Research Centre, and the Pew Organisation which conclude that spiritually committed people are twice as likely to report being "very happy" than the least religiously committed people.{{sfn|Ward|p=156. The Myers book is cited as ''The Science of Subjective Well-Being'' (Guilford Press 2007)}} He reports an analysis of over 200 social studies that "high religiousness predicts a rather lower risk of depression and drug abuse and fewer suicide attempts, and more reports of satisfaction with life and a sense of well-being",{{sfn|Ward|p=156 Smith, Timothy, Michael McCullough, and Justin Poll. 2003: “Religiousness and Depression: Evidence for a Main Effect and Moderating Influence of Stressful Life Events.” Psychological Bulletin 129(4):614–36}} and a review of 498 studies published in peer-reviewed journals that "concluded that a large majority of these studies showed a positive correlation between religious commitment and higher levels of perceived well-being and self-esteem, and lower levels of hypertension, depression and clinical delinquency,{{sfn|Ward|p=157 Bryan Johnson &amp; colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania (2002)}} and similar results from the ''Handbook of Religion and Mental Health''.{{sfn|Ward|p=157 ''Handbook of Religion and Mental Health'' [[Harold Koenig]] (ed.) ISBN 978-0-12-417645-4}} He cites surveys suggesting a strong link between faith and altruism.{{sfn|Ward|pp=159-162 e.g. [http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/data_access/data/datasets/social_capital_community_survey.html a survey] by [[Robert Putnam]] showing that membership of religious groups was positively correlated with membership of voluntary organisations}} He cites extensive studies to show that there is little or no evidence that religion ever causes mental disorders,{{sfn|Ward|p=168 quoting [[Michael Argyle (psychologist)|Michael Argyle]] and others}} and that overall religion is a positive contributor to mental health.

He specifically addresses and rebuts the claim that religious belief is a [[delusion]]. He quotes the definition in the ''Oxford Companion to Mind'' as "a fixed, idiosyncratic belief, unusual in the culture to which the person belongs" suggesting that "most great philosophers have believed in God",{{sfn|Ward|p=170}} and that the many religious people who exhibit a high degree of rational ability "... and who can produce a reasonable and coherent defense of their beliefs" refute the idea that belief in God is a delusion—whether or not it may be mistaken.{{sfn|Ward|p=172}} He also analyses and rejects the idea that faith is a brain malfunction, quoting [[Gerald Edelman]]: "The evolutionary assumption [that consciousness conferred fitness]... implies that consciousness is efficacious - that is, it is not an epiphenomenon",{{sfn|Ward|p=177 quoting [[Gerald Edelman|Edelman]]'s ''Bright Air, Brilliant Fire''}} and suggests that, if consciousness can apprehend truth and cause action, so can faith. Ward suggests that, although harm has been done in the name of religion, the same is true of [[politics]] and science, that religion can "be used to inspire heroic love and commitment. The world would be much poorer without Martin Luther King, [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]], [[Mother Teresa]]... [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] ... [[Francis of Assisi|St Francis]], [[Gautama Buddha|Siddartha Gautama]], [[Jesus]]".{{sfn|Ward|p=180}} He cites many positive contributions made by [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] (he cites in particular founding hospitals, hospices, schools and universities, great works of art, the investigation into the world as the creation of one wise and rational God that gave birth to modern science,{{sfn|Ward|p=184. He notes that Copernicus, Kepler, [[Francis Bacon]] and Isaac Newton were inspired by their Christian faith "to investigate the natural world because of their belief that it was wisely ordered and accessible to human reason"}} the [[Truth and reconciliation commission]], and the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]]) and [[Islam]], and suggests that "there is plenty of room for common social action in mercy and hospitality between Christians and Muslims, and it is imperative that such commonalities are promoted".{{sfn|Ward|p=188}} He concludes by stating that Religion "''is the compassionate heart of what might otherwise seem to be a cold and heartless world''".

'''John of Ford''' (c. 1140 – 21 April 1214) was the prior of the [[Cistercian]] [[Forde Abbey|monastery of Forde]], then from 1186 abbot of its daughter house of [[Bindon Abbey|Bindon]], and between 1191 and 1214 the abbot of Forde. He was a friend and ally of [[John of England|King John]] during the [[interdict|papal interdict]], receiving remuneration from the king.&lt;ref&gt;Josiah Cox Russell, "Social Status at the Court of King John," ''[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]'', '''12''':3 (1937), 326.&lt;/ref&gt; While prior he wrote a biography of the local [[anchorite]] [[Wulfric of Haselbery]] (the ''Vita Wulfrici anchoretae Haselbergiae''), and while abbot he completed the series of sermons on the ''[[Song of Songs]]'' begun by [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] and continued by [[Gilbert of Hoyland]] with 120 sermons on his own from the fifth chapter through the end of the book. In the centuries after his death in 1214, however, John of Ford was almost entirely forgotten. His 120 sermons survive in only a single manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard McGinn, ''The Growth of Mysticism'' (1994), 305–09.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Krummholz''''' or '''''krumholtz''''' ([[German language|German]]: ''krumm'', "crooked, bent, twisted" and ''Holz'', "wood") — also called '''''knieholz''''' ("knee timber") — is a type of stunted, deformed vegetation encountered in [[subarctic]] and [[subalpine zone|subalpine]] [[tree line]] landscapes, shaped by continual exposure to fierce, freezing winds. Under these conditions, trees can only survive where they are sheltered by rock formations or [[snow]] cover. As the lower portion of these trees continues to grow, the coverage becomes extremely dense near the ground.&lt;ref name="NPS"&gt;{{cite web

==Species==
[[File:Windswept trees in Colorado.jpg |thumb|left|''[[Picea engelmannii]]'' flag tree in Colorado, at the tree line]]
Common trees showing krumholtz formation include [[European spruce]], [[mountain pine]], [[balsam fir]], [[red spruce]], [[black spruce]], [[subalpine fir]], [[subalpine larch]], [[Engelmann spruce]], [[whitebark pine]], [[limber pine]], and [[lodgepole pine]]. Instances of the krumholtz form of black spruce, ''[[Picea mariana]]'', are found in the northern Canadian [[boreal forest]]s.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2008. [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=44751 ''Black Spruce: Picea mariana'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N.

[[Abies lasiocarpa|Subalpine fir]] is the most common associate of spruce in krummholz vegetation. Other associated [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] species include alpine larch (''[[Larix lyallii]]''), whitebark pine (''[[Pinus albicaulis]]''), limber pine (''[[Pinus flexilis]]''), and western white pine (''[[Pinus monticola]]'') in southern British Columbia, and mountain hemlock (''[[Tsuga mertensiana]]'') on the eastern slopes of the Coast Range and in the Revelstoke area. Lodgepole pine ([[Pinus contorta|''Pinus contorta'' var. ''contorta'']]) is a minor associate in most of the British Columbia interior, except in dry alpine areas of southwest Cariboo/Chilcotin district where it is abundant (Pojar 1985).&lt;ref name="pojar1"&gt;Pojar, J. 1985.

==Flag tree==

[[File:Windswept tree TdP.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Banner tree, [[Torres del Paine]] National Park, Chile]]
A variation of krummholz formation is a '''flag tree''' or '''banner tree'''. Branches on the [[windward]] side are killed or deformed by the almost constant strong winds, giving the tree a characteristic flag-like appearance. Where the lower portion of the tree is protected by snow cover or rocks, only the exposed upper portion may have this appearance. This is a rather common occurrence in red spruce trees of the highest peaks of the central, even southern [[Appalachian Mountains]], and is most commonly seen in the wind-swept high peaks and plateaus of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. This formation most notably occurs with high frequency in the [[Dolly Sods]] and [[Roaring Plains West Wilderness]] areas along the [[Allegheny Front]] in eastern [[West Virginia]], typically occurring at elevations of 3,800 feet (1,100&amp;nbsp;m) and higher. [[Trade wind]]s in tropical regions near the equator can also shape trees in a similar manner.&lt;ref name="NPS"/&gt;

A '''hypothetical Solar System object''' is a [[planet]], [[natural satellite]], [[moonmoon]] or similar body in the [[Solar System]] whose existence is not known, but has been inferred from observational scientific evidence. Over the years a number of hypothetical planets have been proposed, and many have been disproved. However, even today there is scientific speculation about the possibility of planets yet unknown that may exist beyond the range of our current knowledge.

==Planets==
*[[Counter-Earth]], a planet situated on the other side of the Sun from that of the Earth. 
*[[Fifth planet (hypothetical)]], historical speculation about a planet between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
**[[Phaeton (hypothetical planet)|Phaeton]], a planet situated between the orbits of [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]] whose destruction supposedly led to the formation of the [[asteroid belt]]. These days, this hypothesis is considered unlikely, since the asteroid belt has far too little mass to have resulted from the explosion of a large planet.
** [[Planet V]], a planet thought by [[John Chambers (scientist)|John Chambers]] and [[Jack Lissauer]] to have once existed between [[Mars]] and the [[asteroid belt]], based on computer simulations.
* [[Planet Nine]], a planet proposed to explain apparent alignments in the orbits of a number of distant trans-Neptunian objects. 
* [[Planet X]], a hypothetical planet beyond [[Neptune]]. Initially employed to account for supposed [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] (systematic deviations) in the orbits of [[Uranus]] and Neptune, belief in its existence ultimately inspired the search for [[Pluto]]. Though the concept has since been abandoned following more precise measurements of Neptune's mass, which accounted for all observed perturbations, it has been re-applied to account for supposed deviations in the motions  of [[Kuiper Belt|Kuiper belt]] objects. Such explanations are still controversial, however. 
* [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], a Mars-sized impactor believed to have collided with the Earth roughly 4.5 billion years ago; an event which created the [[Moon]].
* [[Vulcan (hypothetical planet)|Vulcan]], a hypothetical planet once believed to exist inside the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]. Initially proposed as the cause for the perturbations in the orbit of Mercury, some astronomers spent many years searching for it, with many instances of people claiming to have found it. The perturbations in Mercury's orbit were later accounted for via Einstein's [[General Theory of Relativity]]. 
** [[Vulcanoid]]s, asteroids that may exist within a gravitationally stable region inside Mercury's orbit.
*[[Tyche (hypothetical planet)|Tyche]], a hypothetical planet in the [[Oort Cloud]] supposedly responsible for producing the statistical excess in long period [[comet]]s in a band.&lt;ref&gt; The Independent, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/up-telescope-search-begins-for-giant-new-planet-2213119.html "Up telescope! Search begins for giant new planet"], Sunday 13 February 2011, Paul Rodgers &lt;/ref&gt; Results from the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer|WISE telescope]] survey in 2014 have ruled it out.&lt;ref name="NASA-20140307"&gt;{{cite journal

*In the [[Five-planet Nice model]] a fifth giant planet originally in an orbit between [[Saturn]] and [[Uranus]] is ejected from the Solar System into interstellar space after a close encounter with [[Jupiter]], resulting in a rapid divergence of Jupiter's and Saturn's orbit may have ensured the orbital stability of the [[terrestrial planet]]s in the inner Solar System. It may have also precipitated the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] of the inner Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Grossman: "Lost planet explains solar system puzzle" ''New Scientist'': 01.10.2011: 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moons==
* [[Chiron (hypothetical moon)|Chiron]], a moon of [[Saturn]] supposedly sighted by [[Hermann Goldschmidt]] in 1861 but never observed by anyone else.
* [[Claimed moons of Earth|Other moons of]] [[Earth]], such as [[Claimed moons of Earth#Petit.27s moon|Petit's moon]], [[Lilith (moon)|Lilith]], [[Claimed moons of Earth#Waltemath.27s moons|Waltemath's moons]] and [[Claimed moons of Earth#Other claims|Bargby's moons]]. 
* [[Mercury's moon]], hypothesised to account for an unusual pattern of radiation detected by ''[[Mariner 10]]'' in the vicinity of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]. Subsequent data from the mission revealed the actual source to be the star [[31 Crateris]].
* [[Neith (hypothetical moon)|Neith]], a purported moon of [[Venus]], falsely detected by a number of telescopic observers in the 17th and 18th centuries. Now known not to exist, the object has been explained as a series of misidentified stars and internal reflections inside the optics of particular telescope designs.
* [[Themis (hypothetical moon)|Themis]], a moon of Saturn which astronomer [[William Henry Pickering|William Pickering]] claimed to have discovered in 1905, but which was never seen again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nineplanets.org/hypo.html#sat Hypothetical Planets&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Star==
* [[Nemesis (hypothetical star)|Nemesis]], a [[brown dwarf|brown ]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;or [[red dwarf]] whose existence was suggested in 1984 by physicist [[Richard A. Muller]], based on purported periodicities in [[mass extinction]]s within Earth's fossil record. Its regular passage through the Solar System's [[Oort cloud]] would send large numbers of comets towards Earth, massively increasing the chances of an impact. Also believed to be the cause of minor planet [[90377 Sedna|Sedna's]] unusual elongated orbit. The existence of the [[Nemesis (hypothetical star)|Nemesis]] in the modern Solar system was ruled out in 2014 after the infrared survey performed by [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer|WISE]] spacecraft found no [[brown dwarf]] up to {{conv|10000|au|ly}} from Sun.

In [[engineering]], '''maintainability''' is the ease with which a product can be maintained in order to:
* correct defects or their cause,
* repair or replace faulty or worn-out components without having to replace still working parts,
* prevent unexpected working condition,
* maximize a product's useful life,
* maximize efficiency, reliability, and safety,
* meet new [[requirements]],
* make future maintenance easier, or
* cope with a changed environment.

In some cases, maintainability involves a system of [[continuous improvement]] - learning from the past in order to improve the ability to maintain systems, or improve reliability of systems based on maintenance experience.

In [[telecommunication]] and several other engineering fields, the term '''maintainability''' has the following meanings:

* A characteristic of design and installation, expressed as the probability that an item will be retained in or restored to a specified condition within a given period of [[time]], when the [[repair and maintenance|maintenance]] is performed in accordance with prescribed procedures and resources.
* The ease with which maintenance of a [[functional unit]] can be performed in accordance with prescribed requirements.

== Software engineering ==
In [[software engineering]], these activities are known as [[software maintenance]] (cf. [[ISO/IEC 9126]]). Closely related concepts in the software engineering domain are evolvability, modifiability, [[Technical debt|technical debt]], and [[Code smell|code smells]].

The maintainability index is calculated with certain formulae from [[Lines of code|lines-of-code measures]], [[McCabe Measure|McCabe measures]] and [[Halstead complexity measures]].

The measurement and track maintainability are intended to help reduce or reverse a system's tendency toward "code entropy" or degraded integrity, and to indicate when it becomes cheaper and/or less risky to rewrite the code than it is to change it.

'''Marcus Junkelmann''' (* 2 October 1949 in [[Munich]]) is a German historian and experimental archeologist.

==Life and work==
Junkelmann started to study history at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] in 1971 and in 1979 he received a PhD for a thesis on the military achievements of [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian II]] (1662–1726) (original title: '' Kurfürst Max Emanuel von Bayern als Feldherr''). After that he worked as an associate member of staff at the university and for a military museum in [[Ingolstadt]].

In the 1980s Junkelmann became well known in Germany for his work in [[experimental archeology]]. He reconstructed and tested Roman weapons and army gear. In 1985 in connection with the 2000 year celebration of the city of [[Augsburg]] he organized a large [[Historical reenactment|experimental reenactment]] of the life and work conditions of [[Legionary|Roman legionaries]]. The experiment consisted of a month-long march from [[Verona]] to [[Augsburg]] including the crossing of the [[Alps]]. For the complete trip the original Roman army gear and equipment was used and the typical legionary tasks were performed. Later Junkelmann went on to perform a similar experiments for the Roman cavalry. He authored several books and documentaries on his archeological experiments. In 1997 he was awarded the [[Ceram Prize]] for his book on the nutrition of Roman soldiers (original title: ''Panis militaris: Die Ernährung des römischen Soldaten oder der Grundstoff der Macht'').

The '''mediocrity principle''' is the [[philosophical]] notion that "if an item is drawn at random from one of several sets or categories, it's likelier to come from the most numerous category than from any one of the less numerous categories".&lt;ref name="Kukla2009"&gt;{{cite book |first=A. |last=Kukla |year=2009 |title=Extraterrestrials: A Philosophical Perspective |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=9780739142455 |lccn=2009032272 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkdqTFVNwmgC&amp;pg=PA20 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has been taken to suggest that there is nothing very unusual about the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|evolution of the Solar System]], [[Earth's history]], the [[evolution of biological complexity]], [[human evolution]], or any one [[nation]]. It is a [[heuristic]] in the vein of the [[Copernican principle]], and is sometimes used as a philosophical statement about the place of humanity. The idea is to assume mediocrity, rather than starting with the assumption that a phenomenon is special, privileged, exceptional, or even [[supremacism|superior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1377474/principle-of-mediocrity|title=principle of mediocrity - astrobiology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MediocrePZ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_12.html#myerspz|title=THE WORLD QUESTION CENTER 2011 — Page 12|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extraterrestrial life==
[[File:Grand prismatic spring.jpg|thumb|200px|Life is ubiquitous on Earth, but does it exist elsewhere?]]

The mediocrity principle suggests, given the existence of life on Earth, that [[life]] typically exists on [[Earth analog|Earth-like planet]]s throughout the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, Eric, and Steve McMillan. ''Astronomy: A Beginner’s Guide to the Universe.'' Ed. Nancy Whilton. San Francisco: Pearson, 2010.{{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other approaches==

The mediocrity principle is in contrast with the [[anthropic principle]], which asserts that the presence of an intelligent observer (humans) limits the circumstances to bounds under which intelligent life can be [[Observation bias|observed to exist]], no matter [[Rare Earth hypothesis|how improbable]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/cosmo/lectures/lec24.html Anthropic Principle]&lt;/ref&gt; Both stand in contrast to the [[Fine-tuned Universe|fine-tuning hypothesis]], which asserts that the natural conditions for intelligent life are implausibly rare.

The mediocrity principle implies that Earth-like environments are necessarily common, based in part on the evidence of [[Doomsday argument|any happening at all]], whereas the anthropic principle suggests that no assertion can be made about the probability of intelligent life based on a sample set of one ([[Dunning–Kruger effect|self-described]]) example, who are necessarily capable of making such an assertion about themselves.

It is also possible to handle the Mediocrity Principle as a statistical problem, a case of a single [[Data point]] statistics, also present in the [[German tank problem]].

==Other uses==
[[David Deutsch]] argues that the mediocrity principle is incorrect from a physical point of view, in reference to either humanity's part of the universe or to its species. Deutsch refers to [[Stephen Hawking]]'s quote: "The human race is just a chemical scum on a moderate-sized planet, orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies". Deutsch wrote that Earth's neighborhood in the universe is not typical (80% of the universe's matter is [[dark matter]]) and that a concentration of mass such as the Solar System is an "isolated, uncommon phenomenon". He also disagrees with [[Richard Dawkins]], who considers that humans, because of natural evolution, are limited to the capabilities of their species. Deutsch responds that even though evolution did not give humans the ability to detect [[neutrino]]s, scientists can currently detect them, which significantly expands their capabilities beyond what is available as a result of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-14-196969-5 |title=The Beginning of Infinity |author=[[David Deutsch]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=August 2015}}

Roughly speaking, in [[decision theory]], [[game theory]], and [[rational choice]], '''menu dependence''' arises when the evaluation of alternatives for choice or the mode of selection guiding choice varies parametrically{{huh|date=October 2016}} with what collection of alternatives is available for choice (i.e., with what "menu" or decision problem a decision maker is facing).  Menu dependence can be accompanied by violations of various so-called consistency (or coherence) constraints, such as Sen's condition α (also known as Chernoff's Axiom, a '''contraction''' condition) and Sen's conditions γ and β ('''expansion''' conditions).   While the phenomenon can arise in a variety of ways, menu dependence is often informally associated with a change in a decision maker's preferences among alternatives with the addition of [[independence of irrelevant alternatives|irrelevant alternative]]s.

In all [[bilaterian]] animals, the '''mesoderm''' is one of the three primary [[germ layer]]s in the very early [[embryo]]. The other two layers are the [[ectoderm]] (outside layer) and [[endoderm]] (inside layer), with the mesoderm as the middle layer between them.&lt;ref name="RFB2004Mesoderm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Langman's Medical Embryology 2010"&gt;Langman's Medical Embryology, 11th edition. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mesoderm forms [[mesenchyme]], [[mesothelium]], non-epithelial blood cells and [[coelomocyte]]s. Mesothelium lines [[coelom]]s. Mesoderm forms the muscles in a process known as [[myogenesis]], septa (cross-wise partitions) and [[Mesentery (zoology)|mesenteries]] (length-wise partitions); and forms part of the [[gonad]]s (the rest being the [[gamete]]s).&lt;ref name="RFB2004Mesoderm"&gt;{{cite book| author=Ruppert, E.E., Fox, R.S., and Barnes, R.D. | title=Invertebrate Zoology | chapter=Introduction to Bilateria | pages=217–218 | publisher=Brooks/Cole| edition=7th | isbn=0-03-025982-7 | year=2004}}{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myogenesis is specifically a function of [[Mesenchymal Stem Cell|mesenchyme]].

The mesoderm differentiates from the rest of the embryo through [[intercellular signaling]], after which the mesoderm is [[Cell polarity|polarized]] by an [[FGF and mesoderm formation|organizing center]].&lt;ref name="Kimelman-2004-p363"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kimelman, D.  |author2=Bjornson, C. |lastauthoramp=yes |chapter=Vertebrate Mesoderm Induction: From Frogs to Mice|editor=Stern, Claudio D.|title=Gastrulation: from cells to embryo|publisher=CSHL Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-87969-707-5|page=363|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ljAKtC-iIrIC&amp;pg=PA363}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the organizing center is in turn determined by the regions in which [[beta-catenin]] is protected from degradation by GSK-3. Beta-catenin acts as a co-factor that alters the activity of the transcription factor tcf-3 from repressing to activating, which initiates the synthesis of gene products critical for mesoderm differentiation and gastrulation.  Furthermore, mesoderm has the capability to induce the growth of other structures, such as the [[neural plate]], the precursor to the nervous system.

==Definition==
The mesoderm  is one of the three germinal layers that appears in the third week of embryonic development. It is formed through a process called [[gastrulation]]. There are three important components, the paraxial mesoderm, the intermediate mesoderm and the lateral plate mesoderm. The paraxial mesoderm forms the somitomeres, which give rise to mesenchyme of the head and organize into somites in occipital and caudal segments. give, sclerotome (cartilage and bone), and dermatome (subcutaneous tissue of the skin).&lt;ref name="RFB2004Mesoderm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Langman's Medical Embryology 2010"/&gt; Signals for somite differentiation are derived from surroundings structures, including the notochord, neural tube and epidermis. The intermediate mesoderm connects the paraxial mesoderm with the lateral plate, eventually it differentiates into urogenital structures consisting of the kidneys, gonads, their associated ducts, and the adrenal glands. The lateral plate mesoderm give rise to the heart, blood vessels and blood cells of the circulatory system as well as to the mesodermal components   of the limbs.&lt;ref name="Scott-2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Scott, Gilbert|title=Developmental biology|publisher=Sinauer Associates|edition=ninth|place=USA|year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the mesoderm derivatives include the muscle (smooth, cardiac and skeletal), the muscles of the tongue (occipital somites), the pharyngeal arches muscle (muscles of mastication, muscles of facial expressions), connective tissue, dermis and subcutaneous layer of the [[skin]], [[bone]] and cartilage, dura mater, [[endothelium]] of [[blood vessels]], [[red blood cells]], [[white blood cells]], and microglia, the kidneys and the adrenal cortex.&lt;ref name="Dudek-2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dudek, Ronald W.|title=High-yield. Embryology|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|edition= 4th|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the mesodermal germ layer==
During the third week a process called [[gastrulation]] creates a mesodermal layer between the endoderm and the ectoderm. This process begins with formation of a primitive streak on the surface of the epiblast.&lt;ref name="NCBI-2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10085/|title=Paraxial Mesoderm: The somites and their derivatives|publisher=NCBI|accessdate =April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cells of the layers move between the epiblast and hypoblast and begin to spread laterally and cranially. The cells of the epiblast move toward the primitive streak and slip beneath it in a process called invagination.  Some of the migrating cells displace the hypoblast and create the endoderm, and others migrate between the endoderm and the epiblast to create the mesoderm. The remaining cells form the ectoderm. After that, the epiblast and the hypoblast establish contact with the extraembryonic mesoderm until they cover the yolk sac and amnion. They move onto either side of the prechordal plate. The prechordal cells migrate to the midline to form the notochordal plate. The chordamesoderm is the central region of trunk mesoderm.&lt;ref name="Scott-2010" /&gt; This forms the notochord which induces the formation of the neural tube and establishes the anterior-posterior body axis. The notochord extends beneath the neural tube from the head to the tail. The mesoderm moves to the midline until it covers the notochord, when the mesoderm cells proliferate they form the paraxial mesoderm.  In each side, the mesoderm remains thin and is known as the lateral plate.  The intermediate mesoderm lies between the paraxial mesoderm and the lateral plate.
Between days 13 and 15, the proliferation of extraembryonic mesoderm, primitive streak and embryonic mesoderm take place. The notochord process occurs between days 15 and 17. Eventually, the development of the notochord canal and the axial canal takes place between days 17 and 19 when the first three somites are formed.&lt;ref name="Drews-1993"&gt;{{cite book|author= Drew, Ulrich|title=Color atlas of embryology|publisher=Thieme|place=German|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paraxial mesoderm==
During the third week, the paraxial mesoderm is organized into segments. If they appear in the cephalic region and grow with cephalocaudal direction, they are called somitomeres. If they appear in the cephalic region but establish contact with the neural plate, they are known as [[neuromere]]s, which later will form the mesenchyme in the head. The somitomeres organize into somites which grow in pairs. In the fourth week the somites lose their organization and cover the notochord and spinal cord to form the backbone. In the fifth week, there are 4 occipital somites, 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral and 8 to 10 coccygeal that will form the axial skeleton.  Somitic derivatives are determined by local signaling between adjacent embryonic tissues, in particular the neural tube, notochord, surface ectoderm and the somitic compartments themselves.&lt;ref name="Yusuf-2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yusuf|first=Faisal|title=The eventful somite: Patterning, fate determination and cell division in the somite|journal=Anatomy and embryology|year=2006|pages=21–30|url=http://0search.proquest.com.millenium.itesm.mx/healthcomplete/docview/212010706/abstract/13D9F3D5B371BF5540B/1?accountid=11643}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The correct specification of the deriving tissues, skeletal, cartilage, endothelia and connective tissue is achieved by a sequence of morphogenic changes of the paraxial mesoderm, leading to the three transitory somitic compartments: dermomyotome, myotome and sclerotome. These structures are specified from dorsal to ventral and from medial to lateral.&lt;ref name="Yusuf-2006" /&gt; each somite will form its own sclerotome that will differentiate into the tendon cartilage and bone component. Its myotome will form the muscle component and the dermatome that will form the dermis of the back. The myotome and dermatome have a nerve component.&lt;ref name="RFB2004Mesoderm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Langman's Medical Embryology 2010"/&gt;

==Molecular regulation of somite differentiation==
Surrounding structures such as the notochord, neural tube, epidermis and lateral plate mesoderm send signals for somite differentiation&lt;ref name="RFB2004Mesoderm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Langman's Medical Embryology 2010"/&gt; Notochord protein accumulates in presomitic mesoderm destined to form the next somite and then decreases as that somite is established. The notochord and the neural tube activate the protein SHH  which helps the somite to form its sclerotome. The cells of the sclerotome express the protein PAX1 that induces the cartilage and bone formation. The neural tube activates the protein WNT1 that expresses PAX 2 so the somite creates the myotome and dermatome. Finally, the neural tube also secretes neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), so that the somite creates the dermis. Boundaries for each somite are regulated by retinoic acid (RA) and a combination of FGF8 and WNT3a.&lt;ref name="RFB2004Mesoderm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Langman's Medical Embryology 2010"/&gt; So the retinoic acid is an endogenous signal that maintains the bilateral synchrony of mesoderm segmentation and controls bilateral symmetry in vertebrates. The bilaterally symmetric body plan of vertebrate embryos is obvious in somites and their derivates such as the vertebral column. Therefore, asymmetric somite formation correlates with a left-right desynchronization of the segmentation oscillations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vermot|first1=J.|last2=Gallego Llamas|first2=J.|last3=Fraulob|first3=V.|last4=Niederreither|first4=K.|last5=Chambon|first5=P.|last6=Dollé|first6=P.|title=Retinoic acid controls the bilateral symmetry of somite formation in the mouse embryo|journal=Science|date=April 2005|volume=308|issue=5721|pages=563–566|doi=10.1126/science.1108363|pmid=15731404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies with Xenopus and zebrafish have analyzed the factors of this development and how they interact in signaling and transcription. However, there are still some doubts in how the prospective mesodermal cells integrate the various signals they receive and how they regulate their morphogenic behaviours and cell-fate decisions.&lt;ref name="Yusuf-2006" /&gt; Human embryonic stem cells for example have the potential to produce all of the cells in the body and they are able to self-renew indefinitely so they can be used for a large-scale production of therapeutic cell lines.  They are also able to remodel and contract collagen and were induced to express muscle actin. This shows that these cells are multipotent cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyd|first1=N.L.|last2=Robbins KR|first2=K.R.|last3=Dhara SK|first3=S.K.|last4=West FD,|first4=F.D.|last5=Stice SL.|first5=S.L.|title=Human embryonic stem cell-derived mesoderm-like epithelium transitions to mesenchymal progenitor cells|journal=Tissue Engineering.

==Intermediate mesoderm ==
The intermediate mesoderm connects the paraxial mesoderm with the lateral plate and differentiates into urogenital structures.&lt;ref name="Kumar-2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kumar, Rani| title=Textbook of human embryology|publisher=I.K. International|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In upper thoracic and cervical regions this forms the nephrotomes, and in caudally regions this forms the nephrogenic cord. It also helps to develop the excretory units of the urinary system and the gonads.&lt;ref name="Scott-2010" /&gt;

==Lateral plate mesoderm==
The lateral plate mesoderm splits into parietal (somatic) and visceral (splanchnic) layers. The formation of these layers starts with the appearance of intercellular cavities.&lt;ref name="Kumar-2008" /&gt; The somatic layer depends on a continuous layer with mesoderm that covers the amnion. The splanchnic depends on a continuous layer that covers the yolk sac. The two layers cover the intraembryonic cavity.  The parietal layer together with overlying ectoderm forms the lateral body wall folds. The visceral layer forms the walls of the gut tube. Mesoderm cells of the parietal layer form the mesothelial membranes or serous membranes which line the peritoneal, pleural and pericardial cavities.&lt;ref name="RFB2004Mesoderm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Langman's Medical Embryology 2010"/&gt;

'''#NEWPALMYRA''' (Also known as the '''New Palmyra Project''') is an effort to reconstruct the ancient city of [[Palmyra]] as an immersive virtual environment, based on archaeological and other clues.  The project was started from photos [[Bassel Khartabil]] had been taking of Palmyra since 2005.  He began building models of the ancient city, with support from [[Al Aous Publishers]].   
In 2012, Khartabil was arrested, and the original project and open source files were lost.  Barry Threw took over as director of the project, renamed #NEWPALMYRA, and a community of developers, modelers, and archaeologists began collaborating to model, restore, and later recreate from scratch those historical structures captured on film and camera.

In 2015, ISIL captured Palmyra and began destroying some of its famous historical sites. In late 2015, the [[Institute for Digital Archaeology]] began contributing to the New Palmyra Project, sending archaeologists with cheap 3D cameras to capture any  further structures that ISIL might decide to destroy.

; Arch of Triumph&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newpalmyra.org/models/arch-of-triumph/|title=Arch of Triumph|website=#NEWPALMYRA|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Arch-of-triumph-3D-print.stl|thumb|right|100px|Arch of Triumph as a 3D model]]
One of the best known structures in Palmyra was the monumental Arch of Triumph (قوس النصر). Constructed during the reign of Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] (193 to 211), it was sometimes mistakenly referred to as [[Hadrian]]’s arch. It was restored in the 1930s, and then destroyed completely during the [[Syrian Civil War]] in 2015.

Palmyra's main streets were not at right angles, and this arch was famously built at a 30-degree turn in the colonnade between the tetrapylon (التترابيل) and the Temple of Bel (معبد بل), with two richly carved façades angled away from one another.

; Tetrapylon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newpalmyra.org/models/tetrapylon/|title=Tetrapylon|website=#NEWPALMYRA|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tetrapylon-3D-Print.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A 3D-printed version of the Tetrapylon on display at [[Wikimania 2017]]]]
A square platform, each corner containing a group of four columns. This was erected during the renovations of Diocletian at the end of the 3rd century. Each column had a pedestal in its center that originally supported a statue. The original columns were brought from Egypt and carved out of pink granite.  Only one was undamaged in 1963 when the whole was restored with concrete. Destroyed again by [[ISIL]] on January 20, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2016/1210/ISIS-recaptures-Palmyra-A-fresh-assault-on-heritage-sites-video|title=ISIS recaptures Palmyra: A fresh assault on heritage sites?

[[Image:Bassel-bel-3.jpg|thumb|alt=Temple of Bel rendering|Temple of Bel rendering.|100x100px]]This ancient temple was dedicated to the Mesopotamian god Bel in 32 AD.  Bel was worshipped at Palmyra along with the moon god Aglibol and the sun god Yarhibol.  The ruins of the temple were among the best preserved at Palmyra.  they were destroyed by ISIL in August, 2015.

The Roman Theatre at Palmyra (المسرح الروماني بتدمر) dates to the time of Severus. Its remains were restored in the 20th century, and it served for a time as a venue for the annual Palmyra festival.  It was destroyed by ISIL in May 2015.

; Temple of Baal Shamin&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newpalmyra.org/models/temple-of-baal-shamin/|title=Temple of Baal Shamin|website=#NEWPALMYRA|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Temple of Baal Shamin dates to the 2nd century BC, and dedicated to the Canaanite sky deity. Its altar was built in 115 AD, and the temple was rebuilt in 131 AD. In the 5th century AD, it was converted to a church.  In 2015 it was destroyed by ISIL.

This was the first statue modeled by #rsssd (Re-Sculpting Syrian Statues Digitally).  In 2015 it was destroyed by ISIL.

== Reconstructions and exhibits ==
A 12-ton lifesize replica of part of the Arch of Triumph was carved into stone, from these models, and installed in London's Trafalgar Square in 2016.

A number of small artefacts were reconstructed and displayed at the 2016 Venice Architecture Biennale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newpalmyra.org/events/venice-biennale/|title=Venice Biennale|website=#NEWPALMYRA|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Addiction and HIV Data Archive Program''' ('''NAHDAP''') is a [[Digital library|repository]] of drug abuse and [[HIV/AIDS research]] data primarily including social science and behavioral data.&lt;ref&gt;''Addiction,'' 106, 1708-1710&lt;/ref&gt; NAHDAP’s mission is to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction by supporting research across a wide range of disciplines and ensuring the rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of that research to improve prevention, treatment and policy.

==Description==

NAHDAP is a program within the [[ICPSR|Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)]], a unit in the Institute for Social Research (ISR) at the [[University of Michigan]]. NAHDAP's staff consists of professional researchers, data archivists and technicians working together to obtain, process, distribute, and promote amongst social science researchers [[Data sharing|sharing of data]] relevant to drug addiction and HIV. 

NAHDAP is a project of the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]], part of the [[National Institutes of Health]]. The [http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NAHDAP/ NAHDAP Web site] launched in June 2010 and offers a library of electronic data and [[citations]] to publications based on those data. NAHDAP provides technical assistance and resources to investigators to facilitate preparing their data for archiving so that they can be easily and effectively archived at project completion. NAHDAP also provides technical assistance to users of the data sets, including workshops and webinars, to train analysts in the unique characteristics of selected datasets, in [[Quantitative research|quantitative method]]s, and in the utility of analyzing [[Secondary data analysis|secondary data]] for the [[Reproduceability|reproduction of original research findings]] and addressing new research questions on major issues of social and behavioral sciences and public policy.

'''Philosophy of history''' is the philosophical study of [[history]] and the past. The term was coined by [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Voltaire]], ''La philosophie de l'histoire'', Changuion, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
In [[contemporary philosophy]] a distinction is made between critical philosophy of history (also known as analytic) and speculative philosophy of history. The names of these types are derived from [[C. D. Broad]]'s distinction between [[critical philosophy]] and [[speculative philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g. W. H. Walsh, ''Introduction to the Philosophy of History'' (1951) ch. 1 p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Gruner, "The concept of speculative philosophy of history," ''Metaphilosophy'' '''3'''(4).&lt;/ref&gt;

The former studies the past itself whereas the latter is the equivalent of what the [[philosophy of science]] is for nature.&lt;ref&gt;The Continuing Relevance of Speculative Philosophy of History, Journal of the Philosophy of History&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philosophy of History, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there is some overlap between the two aspects, they can usually be distinguished; modern professional historians tend to be skeptical about speculative philosophy of history.

Sometimes critical philosophy of history is included under [[historiography]]. Philosophy of history should not be confused with the [[history of philosophy]], which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas in their historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/stefan-collini/what-intellectual-history|title=What is Intellectual History?|work=historytoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-modern history==
In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE) maintained the superiority of poetry over history because poetry speaks of what ''must'' or ''should'' be [[truth|true]] rather than merely what ''is'' true.

[[Herodotus]], a fifth-century BCE contemporary of [[Socrates]], broke from the [[Homer|Homeric tradition]] of passing [[narrative]] from generation to generation in his work "Investigations" (Ancient Greek: Ἱστορίαι; Istoríai), also known as [[Histories (Herodotus)|''Histories'']]. Herodotus, regarded by some{{who|date=June 2016}} as the first systematic historian, and, later, [[Plutarch]] (46–120 CE) freely invented [[discourse|speeches]] for their historical figures and chose their historical subjects with an eye toward [[moral]]ly improving the reader. History was supposed to teach good examples for one to follow. The assumption that history "should teach good examples" influenced how writers produced history. Events of the past are just as likely to show bad examples that one should not follow, but classical historians would either not record such examples or would re-interpret them to support their assumption of history's purpose.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

From the Classical period to the [[Renaissance]], historians alternated between focusing on subjects designed to improve mankind and on a devotion to fact. History was composed mainly of [[hagiography|hagiographies]] of [[sovereignty|monarchs]] or of [[epic poetry]] describing [[hero]]ic gestures (such as ''[[The Song of Roland]]''—about the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] (778) during [[Charlemagne]]'s first campaign to conquer the [[Iberian peninsula]]).

In the fourteenth century, [[Ibn Khaldun]], who is considered one of the fathers of the philosophy of history, discussed his philosophy of history and society in detail in his ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377). His work represents a culmination of earlier works by [[Social theory#Sociology in medieval Islam|medieval Islamic sociologists]] in the spheres of [[Islamic ethics]], [[political science]], and [[Historiography of early Islam|historiography]], such as those of [[al-Farabi]] (c. 872 – c. 950), [[Ibn Miskawayh]], al-Dawani, and [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] (1201–1274).&lt;ref name=Mowlana&gt;H. Mowlana (2001). "Information in the Arab World", ''Cooperation South Journal'' '''1'''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle [[superstition]] and uncritical acceptance of historical data". He introduced a [[scientific method]] to the philosophy of history (which Dawood considers something "totally new to his age") and he often referred to it as his "new science",&lt;ref&gt;

which is now associated with [[historiography]]. His [[historical method]] also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of the [[State (polity)|state]], [[communication]], [[propaganda]], and [[systematic bias]] in history.&lt;ref name=Mowlana/&gt;

By the eighteenth century historians had turned toward a more [[positivist]] approach—focusing on [[fact]] as much as possible, but still with an eye on telling histories that could instruct and improve. Starting with [[Fustel de Coulanges]] (1830–1889) and [[Theodor Mommsen]] (1817–1903), historical studies began to move towards a more modern scientific{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} form. In the [[Victorian era]], historiographers debated less whether history was intended to improve the [[Reading (process)|reader]], and more on what causes turned history and how one could understand historical change.

==Cyclical and linear history==
{{further information|Social cycle theory}}

Narrative history tends to follow an assumption of linear progression: "this happened, and then that happened; that happened because this happened first".

Many ancient cultures held [[Religion and mythology|mythical]] concepts of history and of [[time]] that were not [[linear]]. Such societies saw history as cyclical, with alternating Dark and Golden Ages. [[Plato]] taught the concept of the [[Great Year]], and other Greeks spoke of [[aeon]]s (eons). Similar examples include the ancient doctrine of [[eternal return]], which existed in [[Ancient Egypt]], in the [[Indian religions]], among the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Pythagoreans]]' and in the [[Stoics]]' conceptions. In his ''[[Works and Days]]'', [[Hesiod]] described five [[Ages of Man]]: the [[Golden Age]], the [[Silver Age]], the [[Bronze Age]], the [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic Age]], and the [[Iron Age]], which began with the [[Dorian invasion]]. Some scholars{{which?|date=July 2018}} identify just four ages, corresponding to the four metals, with the Heroic age as a description of the Bronze Age. A four-age count would match the [[Vedic time keeping|Vedic]] or Hindu ages known as the [[Kali Yuga|Kali]], [[Dwapara Yuga|Dwapara]], [[Treta Yuga|Treta]] and [[Satya Yuga|Satya]] [[yuga]]s. According to [[Jainism]], this world has no beginning or end but goes through cycles of upturns (utsarpini) and downturns (avasarpini) constantly. Many Greeks believed that just as mankind went through four [[stages of character]] during each rise and fall of history so did [[government]]. They considered [[democracy]] and [[monarchy]] as the healthy régimes of the higher ages; and [[oligarchy]] and [[tyranny]] as corrupted régimes common to the lower ages.{{citation needed|date= February 2016}}

In the East, [[Social cycle theory|cyclical theories of history]] developed in China (as a theory of [[dynastic cycle]]) and in the Islamic world in the work of [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332-1406).

The story of [[the Fall of Man]] from the [[Garden of Eden]], as recounted and elaborated in [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], preserves traces of a moral cycle; this would give the basis for [[theodicy|theodicies]] which attempt to reconcile the existence of evil in the world with the existence of a God, providing a global explanation of history with belief in a coming [[Messianic Age]]. Some theodicies claimed that history had a progressive direction leading to an [[eschatological]] end, such as the [[Apocalypse]], organized by a superior power. [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354-430), [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225-1274) and [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] (in his ''Discourse On [[Universal History]]'' of 1679) formulated such theodicies, but [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] (1646-1716), who coined the term ''Théodicée'', developed the most famous philosophical theodicy. Leibniz based his explanation on the [[principle of sufficient reason]], which states that anything that happens, does happen for a specific reason. Thus, while man might see certain events as evil (such as wars, epidemics and natural disasters), such a judgement in fact only reflected human perception; if one adopted [[God's view]], "evil" events in fact only took place in the larger [[divine plan]]. In this way theodicies explained the necessity of evil as a relative element that forms part of a larger plan of history. Leibniz's principle of sufficient reason was not, however, a gesture of [[fatalism]]. Confronted with the antique [[problem of future contingents]], Leibniz invented the theory of "[[compossible worlds]]", distinguishing two types of necessity, to cope with the problem of [[determinism]].

During the [[Renaissance]], cyclical conceptions of history would become common, with proponents illustrating decay and rebirth by pointing to the [[decline of the Roman Empire]]. [[Machiavelli]]'s ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'' (1513–1517) provide an example. The notion of [[Empire]] contained in itself ascendance and [[decadence]],{{cn|date=July 2018}} as in [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776) (which the Roman Catholic Church placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'').

[[Social cycle theory|Cyclical conceptions]] continued in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in the works of authors such as [[Oswald Spengler]] (1880–1936), [[Nikolay Danilevsky]] (1822–1885), and [[Paul Kennedy]] (1945– ), who conceived the human past as a series of repetitive rises and falls. Spengler, like [[Herbert Butterfield| Butterfield]], when writing in reaction to the carnage of the [[First World War]] of 1914–1918, believed that a civilization enters upon an era of [[Caesarism]]&lt;ref&gt;
Compare [https://books.google.com/books?id=XDWcLHxfthMC Oswald Spengler and History as Destiny], page 93: "[...] the closing years of the First World War, when Spengler was completing his work, had witnessed the passing of the feudal rule of landed aristocracy in Germany and its merging into budding forms of parliamentary plutocracy - soon to be followed by the rise of 'mobocracy' and then Caesarism."
&lt;/ref&gt;
after its soul dies.{{citation needed|date= February 2016}} Spengler thought that the soul of the West was dead and that Caesarism was about to begin.

The development of mathematical models of long-term secular sociodemographic cycles revived interest in cyclical theories of history (see, for example, ''Historical Dynamics'' (2003) by [[Peter Turchin]], or ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics''&lt;ref&gt;

==Sustainable history==
''"Sustainable History and the Dignity of Man"'' is a philosophy of history proposed by [[Nayef Al-Rodhan]], where history is defined as ''a durable progressive trajectory in which the quality of life on this planet or all other planets is premised on the guarantee of human dignity for all at all times under all circumstances.''&lt;ref&gt;Nayef R.F. Al-Rodhan, Sustainable History and the Dignity of Man: A Philosophy of History and Civilisational Triumph (Berlin: [http://www.lit-verlag.de/isbn/3-643-80005-3 LIT], 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; This theory views history as a linear progression propelled by [[good governance]], which is, in turn, to be achieved through balancing the emotional, amoral, and egoistic elements of [[human nature]] with the human dignity needs of reason, security, [[human rights]], accountability, transparency, justice, opportunity, innovation, and inclusiveness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcsp.ch/Globalisation/Publications/Faculty-Publications/Books-and-Edited-Volumes/Sustainable-History-and-the-Dignity-of-Man-A-Philosophy-of-History-and-Civilisational-Triumph GCSP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314154010/http://www.gcsp.ch/Globalisation/Publications/Faculty-Publications/Books-and-Edited-Volumes/Sustainable-History-and-the-Dignity-of-Man-A-Philosophy-of-History-and-Civilisational-Triumph |date=2012-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Human dignity'' lies at the heart of this theory and is paramount for ensuring the sustainable history of humankind. Among other things, [[human dignity]] means having a positive sense of self and instilling individuals with respect for the communities to which they belong. Thus, reconciling humans' predisposition for emotionally self-interested behavior with the imperatives of human dignity appears as the one of the most important challenges to global policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressclub.ch/menu/events/event_060710_1130.htm Geneva Press Club] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003094748/http://www.pressclub.ch/menu/events/event_060710_1130.htm |date=2011-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At national level, they have to protect their citizens against violence and provide them with access to food, housing, clothes, health care, and education. Basic welfare provision and security are fundamental to ensuring human dignity. Environment and ecological considerations need to be addressed as well. Finally, cultural diversity, inclusiveness and participation at all levels, of all communities are key imperatives of human dignity.

In this respect, the sustainable history philosophy challenges existing concepts of [[civilisations]], such as [[Samuel Huntington (political scientist)|Samuel Huntington's]] ''[[Clash of Civilisations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookpleasures.com/websitepublisher/articles/2610/1/-Sustainable-History-and-the-Dignity-of-Man-Reviewed-By-Norm-Goldman-of-Bookpleasurescom/Page1.html|title=Sustainable History and the Dignity of Man Reviewed By Norm Goldman of Bookpleasures.com|work=bookpleasures.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it argues that human civilisation should not be thought of as consisting of numerous separate and competing civilisations, but rather it should be thought of collectively as only one human civilisation. Within this civilisation are many geo-cultural domains that comprise'' [[sub-cultures]]. ''[[Nayef Al-Rodhan]]'' ''envisions human civilisation as an ocean into which the different geo-cultural domains flow like rivers,'' "The Ocean Model of one Human Civilization". ''At points where geo-cultural domains first enter the ocean of human civilisation, there is likely to be a concentration or dominance of that culture. However, over time, all the rivers of geo-cultural domains become one. There is fluidity at the ocean's centre and cultures have the opportunity to borrow between them. Under such historical conditions the most advanced forms of human enterprise can thrive and lead us to a'' 'civilisational triumph'. ''Nevertheless, there are cases where geographical proximity of various cultures can also lead to friction and conflict.

[[Nayef Al-Rodhan]] concludes that within an increasingly globalised, interconnected and interdependent world, human dignity cannot be ensured globally and in a sustainable way through sole national means. A genuine global effort is required to meet the minimum criteria of human dignity globally. Areas such as conflict prevention, socio-economic justice, gender equality, protection of human rights, environmental protection require a holistic approach and a common action.

==The Enlightenment's ideal of progress==
{{further information|Age of Enlightenment |Social progress}}

During the ''Aufklärung'', or Enlightenment, history began to be seen as both linear and irreversible. [[Condorcet]]'s interpretations of the various "stages of humanity" or [[Auguste Comte]]'s [[positivism]] were one of the most important formulations of such conceptions of history, which trusted [[social progress]]. As in [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'' (1762) treatise on education (or the "art of training men"), the ''Aufklärung'' conceived the human species as perfectible: [[human nature]] could be infinitely developed through a well-thought [[pedagogy]]. In ''[[What is Enlightenment?]]'' (1784), [[Immanuel Kant]] defined the ''Aufklärung'' as the capacity to think by oneself, without referring to an exterior authority, be it a prince or tradition:

{{quotation|Enlightenment is when a person leaves behind a state of immaturity and dependence (''Unmündigkeit'') for which they themselves were responsible. Immaturity and dependence are the inability to use one's own [[intellect]] without the direction of another. One is responsible for this immaturity and dependence, if its cause is not a lack of intelligence or education, but a lack of determination and courage to think without the direction of another. ''[[wikt:Sapere aude|Sapere aude]]! Dare to know!'' is therefore the slogan of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].}}

In a paradoxical way, Kant supported in the same time [[enlightened despotism]] as a way of leading humanity towards its [[autonomy]]. He had conceived the process of history in his short treaty ''[[Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose]]'' (1784). On one hand, enlightened despotism was to lead nations toward their liberation, and progress was thus inscribed in the scheme of history; on the other hand, liberation could only be acquired by a singular gesture, ''Sapere Aude''! Thus, autonomy ultimately relied on the individual's "determination and courage to think without the direction of another."

After Kant, [[G. W. F. Hegel]] developed a complex theodicy in the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807), which based its conception of history on [[dialectics]]: the negative (wars, etc.) was conceived by Hegel as the motor of history. Hegel argued that history is a constant process of dialectic clash, with each [[thesis]] encountering an opposing idea or event [[antithesis]]. The clash of both was "superated" in the [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]], a conjunction that conserved the contradiction between thesis and its antithesis while [[Aufheben|sublating]] it. As [[Marx]] famously explained afterwards, concretely that meant that if [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]'s monarchic rule in France was seen as the thesis, the [[French Revolution]] could be seen as its antithesis. However, both were sublated in [[Napoleon]], who reconciled the revolution with the ''[[Ancien Régime]]''; he conserved the change. Hegel thought that [[reason]] accomplished itself, through this dialectical scheme, in History. Through [[Manual labour|labour]], man transformed nature so he could recognize himself in it; he made it his "home." Thus, reason spiritualized nature. Roads, fields, fences, and all the modern infrastructure in which we live is the result of this spiritualization of nature. Hegel thus explained social progress as the result of the labour of reason in history. However, this dialectical reading of history involved, of course, contradiction, so history was also conceived of as constantly conflicting: Hegel theorized this in his famous [[Slave-master dialectic|dialectic of the lord and the bondsman]].

According to Hegel,
{{quotation|One more word about giving instruction as to what the world ought to be. Philosophy in any case always comes on the scene too late to give it... When philosophy paints its gray in gray, then has a shape of life grown old. By philosophy's gray in gray it cannot be rejuvenated but only understood. The [[owl of Minerva]] spreads its wings only with the falling of the dusk.|&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, [[Philosophy of Right]] (1820), "Preface"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, philosophy was to explain ''Geschichte'' (history) afterward. Philosophy is always late, it is only an interpretation of what is rational in the real—and, according to Hegel, only what is recognized as rational is real. This idealist understanding of philosophy as interpretation was famously challenged by [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Theses on Feuerbach|11th thesis on Feuerbach]]'' (1845): "''Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point, however, is to change it.''"

===Social evolutionism===
{{further information|Sociocultural evolution}} &lt;!-- the time sphere --&gt;
Inspired by the Enlightenment's ideal of progress, social evolutionism became a popular conception in the nineteenth century. [[Auguste Comte]]'s (1798–1857) [[positivism|positivist]] conception of history, which he divided into the theological stage, the metaphysical stage and the positivist stage, brought upon by modern science, was one of the most influential doctrines of progress. The [[Whig interpretation of history]], as it was later called, associated with scholars of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] eras in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], such as [[Henry Maine]] or [[Thomas Macaulay]], gives an example of such influence, by looking at human history as progress from savagery and ignorance toward peace, prosperity, and science. Maine described the direction of progress as "from status to contract," from a world in which a child's whole life is pre-determined by the circumstances of his birth, toward one of mobility and choice.

The publication of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 introduced [[human evolution]]. However, it was quickly transposed from its original biological field to the social field, in "[[social Darwinism]]" theories. [[Herbert Spencer]], who coined the term "[[survival of the fittest]]", or [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] in ''[[Ancient Society]]'' (1877) developed evolutionist theories independent from Darwin's works, which would be later interpreted as social Darwinism. These nineteenth-century [[unilineal evolution]] theories claimed that societies start out in a ''primitive'' state and gradually become more [[civilisation|civilised]] over time, and equated the culture and technology of Western civilisation with progress.

[[Ernst Haeckel]] formulated his [[recapitulation theory]] in 1867, which stated that "[[ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny]]": the evolution of each individual reproduces the species' evolution, such as in the development of [[embryos]]. Hence, a child goes through all the steps from primitive society to modern society. This was later discredited.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Haeckel did not support Darwin's theory of [[natural selection]] introduced in ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' (1859), rather believing in a [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarckian]] [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]].

Progress was not necessarily, however, positive. [[Arthur Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853–55) was a [[decadence|decadent]] description of the evolution of the "[[Aryan race]]" which was disappearing through [[miscegenation]]. Gobineau's works had a large popularity in the so-called [[scientific racism]] theories that developed during the [[New Imperialism]] period.

After the [[World War I|first world war]], and even before [[Herbert Butterfield]] (1900–1979) harshly criticized it, the Whig interpretation had gone out of style. The bloodletting of that conflict had indicted the whole notion of linear progress. [[Paul Valéry]] famously said: "We civilizations now know ourselves mortal."

However, the notion itself didn't completely disappear. ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' (1992) by [[Francis Fukuyama]] proposed a similar notion of progress, positing that the worldwide adoption of [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] as the single accredited political system and even modality of human consciousness would represent the "[[End of History]]". Fukuyama's work stems from an [[Alexandre Kojève|Kojevian]] reading of Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807).

Unlike [[Maurice Godelier]] who interprets history as a process of transformation, [[Tim Ingold]] suggests that history is a movement of [[autopoiesis]]&lt;ref&gt;Ingold, T. On the Distinction between Evolution and History. Social Evolution &amp; History,. Vol. 1, num. 1. 2002. Pp. 5-24. P. 9, [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/130380/ socionauki.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;

A key component to making sense of all of this is to simply recognize that all these issues in social evolution merely serve to support the suggestion that how one considers the nature of history will impact the interpretation and conclusions drawn about history. The critical under-explored question is less about history as content and more about history as process.

In 2011 [[Steven Pinker]] wrote a history of violence and humanity from an evolutionary perspective in which he shows that violence has declined statistically over time.&lt;ref&gt;" The better angels of our nature, a history of violence and humanity ", by [[Steven Pinker]], published 2012 by Penguin books {{ISBN|978-0-141-03464-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The validity of the "great man theory" in historical studies===
{{further|Hero#The hero in historical studies|Great man theory}}

After Hegel, who insisted on the role of "[[Great man theory|great men]]" in history, with his famous statement about [[Napoleon]], "I saw the Spirit on his horse", [[Thomas Carlyle]] argued that history was the biography of a few central individuals, ''[[hero]]es'', such as [[Oliver Cromwell]] or [[Frederick the Great]], writing that "The history of the world is but the biography of great men." His heroes were political and military figures, the founders or topplers of states. His history of great men, of geniuses good and evil, sought to organize change in the advent of greatness. Explicit defenses of Carlyle's position have been rare in the late twentieth century. Most philosophers of history contend that the motive forces in history can best be described only with a wider lens than the one he used for his portraits. A.C. Danto, for example, wrote of the importance of the individual in history, but extended his definition to include ''social individuals,'' defined as "individuals we may provisionally characterize as containing individual human beings amongst their parts. Examples of social individuals might be social classes [...], national groups [...], religious organizations [...], large-scale events [...], large-scale social movements [...], etc." (Danto, "The Historical Individual", 266, in ''Philosophical Analysis and History,'' edited by Williman H. Dray, Rainbow-Bridge Book Co., 1966). The Great Man approach to history was most popular with professional historians in the nineteenth century; a popular work of this school is the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'' (1911), which contains lengthy and detailed biographies about the great men of history. For example, to read about (what is known today as) the "[[Migrations Period]]," consult the biography of [[Attila the Hun]].

After [[Marx]]'s [[historical materialism|conception of a materialist history]] based on the [[class struggle]], which raised attention for the first time to the importance of social factors such as economics in the unfolding of history, [[Herbert Spencer]] wrote "You must admit that the genesis of the great man depends on the long series of complex influences which has produced the race in which he appears, and the social state into which that race has slowly grown....Before he can remake his society, his society must make him."

The [[Annales School]], founded by [[Lucien Febvre]] and [[Marc Bloch]], were a major landmark on the shift from a history centered on [[subject (philosophy)|individual subjects]] to studies concentrating in [[geography]], economics, [[demography]], and other social forces. [[Fernand Braudel]]'s studies on the [[Mediterranean Sea]] as "hero" of history, [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]]'s history of [[climate]], etc., were inspired by this School.

==Is history predetermined?==
There is disagreement about the extent to which history is ultimately deterministic (see [[historical determinism]]). Some argue that geography (see [[geographic determinism]]), economic systems (see [[economic determinism]]), or culture (see [[cultural determinism]]) prescribe "the iron laws of history" that decide what is to happen. Others see history as a long line of acts and accidents, big and small, each playing out its consequences until that process gets interrupted by the next.

It should be noted that even determinists do not rule that, from time to time, certain cataclysmic events occur to change course of history. Their main point is, however, that such events are rare and that even apparently large shocks like wars and revolutions often have no more than temporary effects on the evolution of the society.

[[Karl Marx]] is, perhaps, the most famous of the exponents of economic determinism. For him social institutions like political system, religion and culture were merely by-products of the basic economic system (see [[Base and superstructure]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://economics.mit.edu/files/9658 Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo. Under the Thumb of History? Political institutions and the Scope for Action]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even he did not see history as completely deterministic. His essay ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'' contains the most famous formulation of Marx's view of the role of the individual in history: ''Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under given circumstances directly encountered and inherited from the past.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marx2mao.com/M&amp;E/EBLB52.html|title=The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte|work=marx2mao.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Does history have a teleological sense?==
{{further|Social progress|Progress (history)}}

[[Theodicy]] claimed that history had a progressive direction leading to an [[eschatological]] end, given by a superior power. However, this transcendent teleological sense can be thought as [[Immanence|immanent]] to human history itself. Hegel probably represents the epitome of teleological philosophy of history. Hegel's teleology was taken up by [[Francis Fukuyama]] in his ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' (see ''Social evolutionism'' above). Thinkers such as [[Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Louis Althusser|Althusser]], or [[Deleuze]] deny any teleological sense to history, claiming that it is best characterized by discontinuities, ruptures, and various time-scales, which the [[Annales School]] had demonstrated.

Schools of thought influenced by Hegel also see history as progressive, but they saw, and see, progress as the outcome of a [[dialectic]] in which factors working in opposite directions are over time reconciled (see above). History was best seen as directed by a ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', and traces of the Zeitgeist could be seen by looking backward. Hegel believed that history was moving man toward "[[civilization]]", and some also claim he thought that the [[Prussia]]n state incarnated the "[[End of History]]". In his ''Lessons on the History of Philosophy'', he explains that each epochal philosophy is in a way the whole of philosophy; it is not a subdivision of the Whole but this Whole itself apprehended in a specific modality.

===Historical accounts of writing history===
{{further information|Historiography}}
A classic example of history being written by the victors—or more precisely, by the survivors&lt;ref name="wah"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Writing African History|author=Philips, John Edward|publisher=University Rochester Press|year=2006|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;—would be the scarcity of unbiased information that has survived to the present about the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]]. Roman historians left tales of cruelty and [[human sacrifice]] practiced by their longtime enemies; however no Carthaginian was left alive to give their side of the story.

Similarly, we only have the [[History of Christianity|Christian]] side of how Christianity came to be the dominant religion of Europe. However, we know very little about other European religions, such as [[Paganism]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} We have the European version of the [[European colonisation of the Americas|conquest of the Americas]], with an interpretation of the native version of events only emerging to popular consciousness since the early 1980s. We have [[Herodotus]]'s Greek history of the [[Persian Wars]], but the Persian recall of the events is little known in Western Culture.

In many respects, the head of state may be guilty of cruelties or even simply a different way of doing things. In some societies, however, to speak of or write critically of rulers can amount to conviction of treason and death. As such, in many ways, what is left as the "official record" of events is oft influenced by one's desire to avoid exile or execution.

However, "losers" in certain time periods often have more of an impetus than the "winners" to write histories that comfort themselves and [[self-justification|justify]] their own behavior.&lt;ref name="wah"/&gt; Examples include the historiography of the [[American Civil War]], where it can be argued that the losers (Southerners) have written more history books on the subject than the winners and, until recently, dominated the national perception of history. Confederate generals such as [[Robert E. Lee|Lee]] and [[Thomas J. Jackson|Jackson]] are generally held in higher esteem than their Union counterparts. Popular films such as ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]'', ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', and ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' have told the story from the Southern viewpoint. Also, despite "losing" the [[Vietnam War]], the United States produces more scholarship on the war than any other country, including Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Triumph Revisited: Historians Battle for the Vietnam War|author=Wiest, Andrew A.|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2010|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular history abounds with condemnations of the cruelty of [[African slave trade]]rs and [[Colonization of Africa|colonists]], despite the "winning" status of those people in their heyday.&lt;ref name="wah"/&gt;

As is true of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|pre-Columbian populations of America]], the historical record of America being [[European colonization of the Americas|"discovered" by Europeans]] is now sometimes presented as a history of invasion, exploitation and dominance of a people who had been there before the Europeans. This reinterpretation of the historical record is called [[historical revisionism]], which can take the form of [[historical revisionism (negationism)|negationism]], which is the denial of [[genocide]]s and [[crimes against humanity]]. The revision of previously accepted historical accounts is a constant process in which "today's winners are tomorrow's losers", and the rise and fall of present institutions and movements influence the way historians see the past.&lt;ref name="wah"/&gt; In the same sense, the teaching, in [[Education in France|French secondary schools]], of the [[Algerian War of Independence#Historiography of the war and of colonialism|Algerian War of Independence and of colonialism]], has been criticized by several historians, and is the subject of frequent debates. Thus, in contradiction with the February 23, 2005 [[French law on colonialism|law on colonialism]], voted by the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] conservative party, historian Benjamin Stora notes that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As Algerians do not appear in their "indigenous" conditions and their sub-citizens status, as the [[Nationalism and resistance in Algeria|history of nationalist movement]] is never evoqued, as none of the great figures of the resistance — [[Messali Hadj]], [[Ferhat Abbas]] — emerge nor retain attention, in one word, as no one explains to students what has been colonisation, we make them unable to understand why the decolonisation took place.&lt;ref name="DiploApril"&gt;[http://mondediplo.com/2001/04/04algeriatorture Colonialism through the school books - The hidden history of the Algerian war], ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', April 2001 {{en icon}}/{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Michel Foucault's analysis of historical and political discourse===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Hero]] --&gt;

The historico-political [[discourse]] analyzed by [[Michel Foucault]] in ''Society Must Be Defended'' (1975–76) considered [[truth]] as the fragile product of a historical struggle, first conceptualized under the name of "[[race struggle]]"—however, the meaning of "race" was different from today's biological notion, being closer to the sense of "nation" (distinct from [[nation-states]]; its signification is here closer to "people"). [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]], for example, was an exponent of nobility rights. He claimed that the French nobility were the racial descendants of the Franks who invaded France (while the Third Estate was descended from the conquered Gauls), and had right to power by virtue of right of conquest. He used this approach to formulate a historical thesis of the course of French political history—a critique of both the monarchy and the Third Estate. Foucault regarded him as the founder of the historico-political discourse as political weapon.

In Great Britain, this historico-political discourse was used by the bourgeoisie, the people and the aristocracy as a means of struggle against the monarchy—cf. [[Edward Coke]] or [[John Lilburne]]. In France, [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]], [[Nicolas Fréret]], and then [[Sieyès]], [[Augustin Thierry]], and [[Antoine Augustin Cournot|Cournot]] reappropriated this form of discourse. Finally, at the end of the nineteenth century, this discourse was incorporated by racialist biologists and [[eugenicists]], who gave it the modern sense of "race" and, even more, transformed this popular discourse into a "[[state racism]]" (Nazism). According to Foucault, [[Marxist]]s also seized this discourse and took it in a different direction, transforming the [[essentialist]] notion of "race" into the historical notion of "[[class struggle]]", defined by socially structured position: capitalist or proletarian. This displacement of discourse constitutes one of the bases of Foucault's thought: discourse is not tied to the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]], rather the "subject" is a construction of discourse. Moreover, discourse is not the simple [[ideological]] and mirror reflexion of an economical [[infrastructure]], but is a product and the battlefield of multiples forces—which may not be reduced to the simple dualist [[contradiction]] of two energies.

Foucault shows that what specifies this discourse from the juridical and philosophical discourse is its conception of truth: truth is no longer absolute, it is the product of "race struggle". History itself, which was traditionally the sovereign's science, the [[legend]] of his glorious feats and monument building,he(the sovereign) built monuments,fought in wars and claims victory on behalf of himself which ultimately became the discourse of the people (modern population), a political stake. The subject is not any more a neutral [[arbitrator]], judge, or [[legislator]], as in [[Solon]]'s or Kant's conceptions. Therefore, what became the "[[historical subject]]" must search in history's furor, under the "juridical code's dried blood", the multiple [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingencies]] from which a fragile [[rationality]] temporarily finally emerged. This may be, perhaps, compared to the [[sophist]] discourse in Ancient Greece. Foucault warns that it has nothing to do with [[Machiavelli]]'s or [[Hobbes]]'s discourse on war, for to this popular discourse, the [[sovereignty|Sovereign]] is nothing more than "an illusion, an instrument, or, at the best, an enemy. It is {the historico-political discourse} a discourse that beheads the king, anyway that dispenses itself from the sovereign and that denounces it".

===History and education===

{{Further information|Education|Pedagogy|Philosophy of education}}
Since [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', civic education and instruction has had a central role in politics and the constitution of a common identity. History has thus sometimes become the target of [[propaganda]], for example in [[historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionist]] attempts. Plato's insistence on the importance of education was relayed by Rousseau's ''[[Emile: Or, On Education]]'' (1762), a necessary counterpart of ''The [[Social Contract]]'' (also 1762). [[Public education]] has been seen by republican regimes and the Enlightenment as a prerequisite of the masses' progressive emancipation, as conceived by Kant in ''[[What is Enlightenment?|Was Ist Aufklärung?]]'' (What Is Enlightenment?, 1784).

The creation of modern education systems, instrumental in the construction of [[nation-states]], also passed by the elaboration of a common, national history. [[History textbooks]] are one of the many ways through which this common history was transmitted. ''[[Le Tour de France par deux enfants]]'', for example, was the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]'s classic textbook for elementary school: it described the story of two French children who, following the German annexation of the [[Alsace-Lorraine]] region in 1870, go on a ''tour de France'' during which they become aware of France's diversity and the existence of the various ''[[patois]]''.

In most societies, schools and curricula are controlled by governments. As such, there is always an opportunity for governments to impose. Granted, often governments in free societies serve to protect freedoms, check [[hate speech]], and breaches of constitutional rights; but the power itself to impose is available to use the education system to influence thought of malleable minds, positively or negatively, towards truth or towards a version of truth. A recent example of the fragility of government involvement with history textbooks was the [[Japanese history textbook controversies]].

===Narrative and history===
A current popular conception considers the value of narrative in the writing and experience of history. Important thinkers in this area include [[Paul Ricœur]], [[Louis Mink]], [[W.B. Gallie]], and [[Hayden White]]. Some have doubted this approach because it draws fictional and historical narrative closer together, and there remains a perceived "fundamental bifurcation between historical and fictional narrative" (Ricœur, vol. 1, 52). In spite of this, most modern historians, such as [[Barbara Tuchman]] or [[David McCullough]], consider narrative writing important to their approaches. The theory of narrated history (or historicized narrative) holds that the structure of lived experience, and such experience narrated in both fictional and non-fictional works (literature and historiography) have in common the figuration of "temporal experience." In this way, narrative has a generously encompassing ability to "'grasp together' and integrate ... into one whole and complete story" the "composite representations" of historical experience (Ricœur x, 173). Louis Mink writes that, "the significance of past occurrences is understandable only as they are locatable in the ensemble of interrelationships that can be grasped only in the construction of narrative form" (148). Marxist theorist [[Fredric Jameson]] also analyzes historical understanding this way, and writes that "history is inaccessible to us except in textual form ... it can be approached only by way of prior (re)textualization" (82).

===History and causality===

{{see also|Causality}}

Narrative and causal approaches to history have often been contrasted or, even, opposed to one another, yet they can also be viewed as complementary.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitson, M. (2014) ''History and Causality'', 127-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers of history such as Arthur Danto have claimed that "explanations in history and elsewhere" describe "not simply an event—something that happens—but a change".&lt;ref&gt;Danto, A. (1968) ''Analytical Philosophy of History'', 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many practicing historians, they treat causes as intersecting actions and sets of actions which bring about "larger changes", in Danto's words: to decide "what are the elements which persist through a change" is "rather simple" when treating an individual's "shift in attitude", but "it is considerably more complex and metaphysically challenging when we are interested in such a change as, say, the break-up of feudalism or the emergence of nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;Danto, A. (1968) ''Analytical Philosophy of History'', 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the historical debate about causes has focused on the relationship between communicative and other actions, between singular and repeated ones, and between actions, structures of action or group and institutional contexts and wider sets of conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitson, M. (2014) ''History and Causality'', 86-116.&lt;/ref&gt; John Gaddis has distinguished between exceptional and general causes (following Marc Bloch) and between "routine" and "distinctive links" in causal relationships: "in accounting for what happened at Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, we attach greater importance to the fact that President Truman ordered the dropping of an atomic bomb than to the decision of the Army Air Force to carry out his orders."&lt;ref&gt;Gaddis, J. L. (2002) ''The Landscape of History: How Historians Map the Past'', 64.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also pointed to the difference between immediate, intermediate and distant causes. For his part, Christopher Lloyd puts forward four "general concepts of causation" used in history: the "metaphysical idealist concept, which asserts that the phenomena of the universe are products of or emanations from an omnipotent being or such final cause"; "the empiricist (or Humean) regularity concept, which is based on the idea of causation being a matter of constant conjunctions of events"; "the functional/teleological/consequential concept", which is "goal-directed, so that goals are causes"; and the "realist, structurist and dispositional approach, which sees relational structures and internal dispositions as the causes of phenomena".&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, C. (1993) ''Structures of History'', 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History as propaganda: Is history always written by the victors?===
In his "Society must be Defended", [[Michel Foucault]] posited that the victors of a social struggle use their political dominance to suppress a defeated adversary's version of historical events in favor of their own [[propaganda]], which may go so far as [[historical revisionism (political)|historical revisionism]]. (See ''Michel Foucault's analysis of historical and political discourse'' above.) Nations adopting such an approach would likely fashion a "universal" theory of history, a [[manifest destiny]] in the US, to support their aims, with a teleological and deterministic philosophy of history used to justify the inevitableness and rightness of their victories.

[[Wolfgang Schivelbusch]]'s ''Culture of Defeat'' took a completely different view—according to him, defeat is a major driver for the defeated to reinvent himself, while the victor—confirmed in his attitudes and methods, dissatisfied by the high losses and paltry gains made, may be less creative and fall back. The concept evokes Hegel's [[Master–slave dialectic]]s—the master is dependent of the work of the slave, the slave has to take his master's and his own interests into account, gets more knowledge and more insight as the master; and in realising that the world around him was created by his own hands he may gain self-consciousness and emancipation. Schivelbusch worked on three basic examples, the South and its [[Lost cause]] after the Civil War, France after the Franco-Prussian War 1870/71, and Germany following World War I. Wolfgang Schivelbusch view includes complex psychological and cultural responses of vanquished nations, from every level of society and sees a need and rise of creativity and various narratives for the defeated.&lt;ref&gt;The Culture of Defeat by Wolfgang Schivelbusch, trans Jefferson Chase Granta, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/29/history.highereducation1 Guardian review 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a society [[Walter Benjamin]] believed that Marxist historians must take a radically different view point from the [[bourgeois]] and [[idealist]] points of view, in an attempt to create a sort of [[People's history|history from below]], which would be able to conceive an alternative conception of history, not based, as in classical historical studies, on the philosophical and juridical discourse of [[sovereignty]]—an approach that would invariably adhere to major states (the victors') points of view.  Philosopher Paul Ricoeur asked instead for a plurality in history writing. "We carry on several histories simultaneously, in times whose periods, crises, and pauses do not coincide. We enchain, abandon, and resume several histories, much as a chess player who plays several games at once, renewing now this one, now the another" (''History and Truth'' 186). [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' is a fictional account of the manipulation of the historical record for nationalist aims and manipulation of power.

To some degree, all nations are active in the promotion of such "national stories", with ethnicity, nationalism, gender, power, heroic figures, class considerations and important national events and trends all clashing and competing within the narrative.

With regard to the [[history of science]], the introduction of new paradigms is depicted by [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''.&lt;ref name=kuhnw&gt;Kuhn, T., 1962, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions", University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; Innovation in science or technology is not based on single experiments or ideas per se, but needs a supportive environment and technical achievements to allow for a change of perspective. In all sorts of science (for e.g. mathematics see Bair et al. 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The process may lead to [[format war]]s, which leaves losers and winners behind.

The [[Semmelweis reflex]] is a metaphor for the reflex-like tendency to reject new evidence or new knowledge because it contradicts established norms, beliefs or paradigms, Semmelweis himself being driven into insanity, but his concept prevailing after his death grew in a strong [[narrative]] of the [[history of medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;Carter, K.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgement of history&lt;!--'Judgement of history' redirects here--&gt;==
For Hegel, the history of the world is also the Last Judgement. Hegel adopted the expression "[[:de:Die Weltgeschichte ist das Weltgericht|Die Weltgeschichte ist das Weltgericht]]" ("[[world history]] is a tribunal that judges the world"; a quote from [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s poem "Resignation" (published in 1786) and used to assert the view that History is what judges men, their actions and their opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Janez Juhant, Bojan Žalec (eds.), ''Reconciliation: The Way of Healing and Growth'', LIT Verlag Münster, 2012, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Photofermentation''' is the [[Fermentative hydrogen production|fermentative]] conversion of organic substrate to [[biohydrogen]] manifested by a diverse group of [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[bacteria]] by a series of [[biochemical]] reactions involving three steps similar to [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic conversion]]. Photofermentation differs from [[dark fermentation]] because it only proceeds in the presence of [[light]].

For example, photo-fermentation with ''[[Rhodobacter sphaeroides]]'' SH2C (or many other purple non-sulfur bacteria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Redwood MD, Paterson-Beedle M, Macaskie LE | title = Integrating dark and light bio-hydrogen production strategies: towards the hydrogen economy. | journal = Reviews in Environmental Science and Bio/Technology | date = June 2009 | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 149 | doi =10.1007/s11157-008-9144-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) can be employed to convert small molecular fatty acids into [[hydrogen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tao Y, Chen Y, Wu Y, He Y, Zhou Z | title = High hydrogen yield from a two-step process of dark-and photo-fermentation of sucrose. | journal = International Journal of Hydrogen Energy | date = February 2007 | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 200–6 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijhydene.2006.06.034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other products.

&lt;br /&gt;
== Light-dependent pathways ==

=== Phototropic bacteria ===
[[Phototroph|Phototropic bacteria]] produce hydrogen gas via photofermentation, where the hydrogen is sourced from organic compounds.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Ghimire A, Frunzo L, Pirozzi F, Trably E, Escudie R, Lens PN, Esposito G |date= April 2015 |title=A review on dark fermentative biohydrogen production from organic biomass: Process parameters and use of by-products |journal=Applied Energy |volume=144 |pages=73–95 |doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.01.045 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;chem&gt;C6H12O6 + 6H2O -&gt;[{hv}] 6CO2 + 12H2&lt;/chem&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Photolytic producers ===
[[Photolysis|Photolytic]] producers are similar to phototrophs, but source hydrogen from water molecules that are broken down as the organism interacts with light.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Photolytic producers consist of algae and certain photosynthetic bacteria.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

&lt;chem&gt;12H2O -&gt;[{hv}] 12H2 + 6O2&lt;/chem&gt;(algae)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

&lt;chem&gt;CO + H2O -&gt;[{hv}] H2 + CO2&lt;/chem&gt;(photolytic bacteria)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Sustainable energy production ==
Photofermentation via purple nonsulfur producing bacteria has been explored as a method for the production of biofuel.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Corneli E, Adessi A, Olguín EJ, Ragaglini G, García-López DA, De Philippis R | title = Biotransformation of water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes) to biohydrogen by Rhodopseudomonas palustris | journal = Journal of Applied Microbiology | volume = 123 | issue = 6 | pages = 1438–1446 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 28972701 | doi = 10.1111/jam.13599 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The natural fermentation product of these bacteria, hydrogen gas, can be harnessed as a natural gas energy source.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Laurinavichene T, Tekucheva D, Laurinavichius K, Tsygankov A | title = Utilization of distillery wastewater for hydrogen production in one-stage and two-stage processes involving photofermentation | journal = Enzyme and Microbial Technology | volume = 110 | pages = 1–7 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29310850 | doi = 10.1016/j.enzmictec.2017.11.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uyar B | title = Bioreactor design for photofermentative hydrogen production | journal = Bioprocess and Biosystems Engineering | volume = 39 | issue = 9 | pages = 1331–40 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27142376 | doi = 10.1007/s00449-016-1614-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Photofermentation via algae instead of bacteria is used for bioethanol production, among other liquid fuel alternatives.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Costa RL, Oliveira TV, Ferreira J, Cardoso VL, Batista FR | title = Prospective technology on bioethanol production from photofermentation | journal = Bioresource Technology | volume = 181 | pages = 330–7 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25678298 | doi = 10.1016/j.biortech.2015.01.090 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bioreactor principle.svg|thumb|Basic principles of a bioreactor. The photofermentation bioreactor would not include an air pathway.]]

=== Mechanism ===
The bacteria and their energy source are held in a [[bioreactor]] chamber that is impermeable to air and oxygen free.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The proper temperature for the bacterial species is maintained in the bioreactor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The bacteria are sustained with a carbohydrate diet consisting of simple [[Carbohydrate|saccharide]] molecules.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang Q, Wang Y, Zhang Z, Lee DJ, Zhou X, Jing Y, Ge X, Jiang D, Hu J, He C | title = Photo-fermentative hydrogen production from crop residue: A mini review | journal = Bioresource Technology | volume = 229 | pages = 222–230 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28108074 | doi = 10.1016/j.biortech.2017.01.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The carbohydrates are typically sourced from agricultural or forestry waste.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Variations ===
[[File:Green_algae_in_a_bioreactor.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Green_algae_in_a_bioreactor.jpg|thumb|Depiction of algae (species not specified) in a bioreactor suitable for bioethanol production.]]
In addition to wild type forms of ''[[Rhodopseudomonas palustris]], s''cientists have used [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified]] forms to produce hydrogen as well.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Other explorations include expanding the bioreactor system to hold a combination of bacteria, [[algae]] or [[cyanobacteria]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ethanol production is performed by the algae [[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii|''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'']], among other species, in cycling light and dark environments.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The cycling of light and dark environments has also been explored with bacteria for hydrogen production, increasing hydrogen yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Chen CY, Yang MH, Yeh KL, Liu CH, Chang JS |date= September 2008 |title=Biohydrogen production using sequential two-stage dark and photo fermentation processes |journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|volume=33|issue=18|pages=4755–4762|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.06.055 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advantages ===
The bacteria are typically fed with broken down agricultural waste or undesired crops, such as water lettuce or sugar beet molasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keskin T, Hallenbeck PC | title = Hydrogen production from sugar industry wastes using single-stage photofermentation | journal = Bioresource Technology | volume = 112 | pages = 131–6 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22420990 | doi = 10.1016/j.biortech.2012.02.077 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The high abundance of such waste ensures the stable food source for the bacteria and productively uses human-produced waste.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In comparison with [[dark fermentation]], photofermentation produces more hydrogen per reaction and avoids the acidic end products of dark fermentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chandrasekhar K, Lee YJ, Lee DW | title = Biohydrogen production: strategies to improve process efficiency through microbial routes | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 8266–93 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25874756 | pmc = 4425080 | doi = 10.3390/ijms16048266 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limitations ===
The primary limitations of photofermentation as a sustainable energy source stem from the precise requirements of maintaining the bacteria in the bioreactor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Researchers have found it difficult to maintain a constant temperature for the bacteria within the bioreactor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, the growth media for the bacteria must be rotated and refreshed without introducing air to the bioreactor system, complicating the already expensive bioreactor set up.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2276">A '''Planning and Zoning Commission''' is a local [[election|elected]] or appointed [[government]] board charged with recommending to the local town or city council the boundaries of the various original [[zoning]] district and appropriate regulations to be enforced therein and any proposed amendments thereto and shall collect data and keep itself informed as to the best practices generally in effect in the matter city planning and zoning to the end that it may be qualified to act on measures affecting the present and future movement of traffic, the segregation of residential and business districts and the convenience and safety of persons and property in any way dependent on city planning and zoning. Some jurisdictions may refer to them also planning commissions, planning boards, zoning commissions, and zoning boards.

The [[chairman]] of the Planning and Zoning Commission (or a staff member) is responsible for publishing public hearing in the newspaper about certain matters that come before the commission.  Most [[municipal]] or [[County (United States)|county]] Planning and Zoning Commissions consist of five to seven members.  This number does not include alternates. In some states, planning and zoning commissions are regional or county.

Some communities elect planning and zoning commission members.  In other [[jurisdictions]], the Planning and Zoning Commissioners are appointed by the [[Mayor]] or [[First Selectman]] of the [[city]] or [[town]] and approved by the city's legislative body, i.e. [[city council]], [[board of aldermen]], etc. (some planning commissioners are appointed by the City Commission as a whole). 

Please note that planning and zoning commissions may also be approving agencies for development permits, variances to the zoning code. Other jurisdictions may have separate zoning board of adjustments or appeals appointed by the governing body that perform the function instead of the planning and zoning commission doing it. Some jurisdictions have featured court appointed zoning boards/boards of adjustment and appeals due to the quasi-judicial functions.

'''Rich Dad''' is a brand established by [[Robert Kiyosaki]] for a series of educational books and games about personal finance. The trademark is owned by Cashflow Technologies, a corporation established in 1997 by Robert and Kim Kiyosaki to market these books and games.

==Books and other media==
''[[Rich Dad Poor Dad]]'' was written by [[Robert Kiyosaki]] and advocates [[financial independence]] through investing, real estate, owning businesses, and the use of finance protection tactics.

Kiyosaki followed with ''Rich Dad's CASHFLOW Quadrant'' and ''Rich Dad's Guide to Investing''. 

Originally self-published before being picked up commercially, the central concept of ''Rich Dad Poor Dad'' is an anecdotal comparison of his "two fathers". His "poor dad" was his biological father, who became [[Superintendent (education)|Superintendent]] of the Hawaii State Department of Education but had very little real [[net worth]] which is contrasted with this is his  "rich dad".

==Didactic games==
Kiyosaki stresses the value of games, particularly ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', as tools for learning basic financial strategies such as "trade four green houses for one red hotel." Kiyosaki has created several games to reinforce the information in his books. 

"Cashflow 101" is a [[board game]] designed by Kiyosaki, which aims to teach the players concepts of [[investing]] and making [[money]].

There are two stages to the game. In the first, "the [[rat race]]", the player aims to raise his or her character's [[passive income]] level to where it exceeds the character's [[expense]]s through a variety of investment options. The winner is determined in the second stage, "the fast track." To win, a player must get his  character to buy his "dream" or accumulate $50,000 in monthly [[cash flow]].

The game forces the players to do the accounts by themselves. In place of "score cards", there are [[financial statements]]. Therefore, players can see more clearly what is happening with their money. It generally shows how assets generate incomes and liabilities and 'doodads' affect expenses.

Basic strategies involved in this game are: buying and selling stocks, cashflow, appreciation, and leverage.

==Controversy==
{{controversy section|date=October 2014}}
In 2010, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] investigated the Rich Dad seminars associated with Kiyosaki on their consumer advocacy program, ''[[Marketplace (Canadian TV program)|Marketplace]]''.&lt;ref name="MarketPlace"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/2010/road_to_rich_dad/main.html|title= Road to Rich Dad: Who's getting rich off Rich Dad?|author= |date= January 29, 2010|work= [[Marketplace (Canadian TV program)|Marketplace]]|publisher= [[Canadian Broadcasting Company|CBC]]|accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that one-day free seminars were conducted at which three-day courses were offered for $500. At the three-day classes, participants were offered longer courses priced between $12,000 and $45,000. A hidden camera was employed at a $500 seminar in [[Kitchener, Ontario]], showing the trainer, Marc Mousseau, advising participants to request that their credit-card be raised and giving out scripts with instructions for how to ask for limits as high as $100,000.&lt;ref name=CBC-Feb1&gt;{{cite news |title= {{-'}}Rich Dad' seminars deceptive: Marketplace|url=http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2010/01/28/consumer-rich-dad-poor-dad-marketplace.html|date= February 1, 2010|publisher= [[CBC News]]|accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show interviewed Bob Aaron,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aaron.ca/main.cfm|title= About Aaron and Aaron |publisher= Aaron and Aaron Barristers and Solicitors|accessdate=February 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a lawyer whose practice is 25% real estate law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawyerahead.ca/lawyer/view/_28/ |title=Bob Aaron |publisher=Lawyerahead.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; who said that some of Mousseau's advice was unusual and unlikely to work, such as advising that a developer might give two condos free when selling ten, getting an [[Option (finance)|option]] to buy the house at a later date and buying a house in pre-foreclosure.&lt;ref name=CBC-Feb1/&gt; The program also found a claim by the trainer to be untrue; he claimed to have been part of a deal that made $32 million on a mobile home park in Saskatchewan, but the park did not exist. The instructor was described as "overbearing, obnoxious, and rude" by an attendee, after showing video footage of his behavior.&lt;ref name="MarketPlace" /&gt;  

On August 20, 2012, one of Kiyosaki's companies, Rich Global LLC, filed for bankruptcy in Wyoming Bankruptcy Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Company Bankruptcy Information for Rich Global LLC|url=http://business-bankruptcies.com/cases/rich-global-llc|date= August 20, 2012|publisher= busbk.com|accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move followed a ruling by a U.S. District Court jury that former business partners of Kiyosaki were entitled to $23,687,957.21 of the profits from events they helped to set up for Kiyosaki including a 2002 appearance at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. A spokesman for Kiyosaki asserted that the amount of the award exceeded the value of Rich Global LLC and that Kiyosaki would not use money from outside the company to meet the judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Rich Dad, Poor Dad now a bankrupt dad: Best-selling author files for corporate bankruptcy after losing $24m judgement|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2215642/Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad-bankrupt-dad-Best-selling-author-files-corporate-bankruptcy-losing-24m-judgement.html|date= October 10, 2012|work= [[Daily Mail]]|location=London|accessdate=2012-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rich Dad Education==

Part of Rich Dad Education's mission is to increase financial literacy among youth. Rich Dad Education’s CEO Anthony Humpage was interviewed by Business Insider&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kane|first1=Libby|title=6 Money Lessons You Should Have Learned Before College|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-teens-should-know-about-money-college-2014-7|publisher=Business Insider|date=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in July 2014 for teaching the lessons that college bound teens need to know about financial independence.

[[File:Actroid-DER 01.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An [[Actroid]] manufactured by Kokoro Company Ltd.]]
'''Robot fetishism''' (also '''ASFR''' or '''technosexuality'''&lt;ref name="asfr"&gt;"ASFR", documentary short by filmmaker Allison de Fren, 2004 [http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2408202 (streaming video)]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Sexual fetishism|fetishistic]] attraction to [[humanoid robot]]s; also to people acting like robots or people dressed in robot costumes. A less common fantasy involves transformation into a robot. In these ways it is similar to [[agalmatophilia]], which involves attraction to or transformation into [[statue]]s or [[mannequin]]s.&lt;ref name="asfr" /&gt;

Robot fetishism can be viewed as a form of erotic [[anthropomorphism]].&lt;ref name="asfr" /&gt; When transformation or roleplaying is involved it can be thought of as a form of [[erotic objectification]].&lt;ref name="asfr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;"Let's mech love", by Lisa Scott, [[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|''Metro daily paper'']], 7 February 2007 [http://www.metro.co.uk/metrosexual/article.html?in_article_id=36440 (web page)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==ASFR==
By its enthusiasts, robot fetishism is more commonly referred to by the initials "ASFR". This initialism stems from the now-defunct [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]] ''alt.sex.fetish.robots''. Many devotees of this fetish refer to themselves as [[technosexual]],&lt;ref name="metro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bizarre"&gt;"Acting Like a Sex Machine", by Kate Hodges, [[Bizarre (magazine)|''Bizarre Magazine'']], October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; or as "ASFRians".&lt;ref name="asfr" /&gt; ASFR can be divided into two distinct but sometimes overlapping types of fantasies.&lt;ref name="metro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bizarre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ddiss"&gt;"Deviant Desires: Incredibly Strange Sex", by [[Katharine Gates]], Juno Books (October 1999), {{ISBN|1-890451-03-7}} [http://www.deviantdesires.com/map/robots.html (web page)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these is simply a desire to have a ready-made [[android (robot)|android]] partner. This partner can be desired for sex, companionship, or any combination of the two. The main distinguishing feature of this fantasy is that the android is a completely artificial construct, often manufactured solely to fulfil the wishes of its owner. This type of fantasy or situation is referred to as "built".&lt;ref name="asfr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bizarre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sextv"&gt;"Remote Control: Romancing the Robot" (clip only), ''[[SexTV]]'' documentary episode featuring interviews with members of the ASFR community [https://web.archive.org/web/20060716141605/http://www.sextelevision.net/videoplayer/?segmentID=401&amp;n=1 (streaming video)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second type of fantasy prevalent within ASFR is referred to as "transformation". This involves a human who has been either willingly or unwillingly turned into an android. That person can be either oneself or one's partner, or both. It is usually the process of transformation (through whatever means it is achieved) that is the focus of this fantasy.&lt;ref name="asfr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bizarre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sextv" /&gt;

Many people in the ASFR community prefer either one or the other.&lt;ref name="metro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bizarre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sextv" /&gt; In some cases this preference is very strong, and people can be as equally repelled by one type as they are attracted to the other. In other cases, there is as much appreciation for built as there is for transformation.&lt;ref name="ddiss" /&gt; A recent informal survey of ASFR community members found that two thirds prefer built while the remainder prefer transformation or some combination of both.&lt;ref name="fc"&gt;"Transformation vs. Built Poll", Fembot Central Message Board, Sept. 26, 2006 [http://www.fembotcentral.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=4722&amp;sid=6bf74fe352be20c70f2cbfca9f3e49fc (web page)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nova BanzaiBaby01.jpg|left|thumb|200px|An example of ASFR art.]]
The aspects of this fetish that are most appreciated by members of the ASFR community are greatly varied. For some, things like robotic appearance, motion, or sound are important for arousal.&lt;ref name="metro" /&gt; For others, these are not, and a completely lifelike android that appears to be human is desired.&lt;ref name="ddiss" /&gt; This holds true for other aspects, such as [[sentience]] or [[self-awareness]]. The ability of the android to remove parts of its skin or other bodily appendages in order to reveal its circuitry is quite pleasing to some, but distasteful to others.&lt;ref name="ddiss" /&gt; There is a further divide between those who prefer an android to appear human-like and those who would prefer a more mechanical looking robot, i.e. with a metallic surface.

As realistic androids and humanoid robots do not currently exist in a form readily available to the consumer,&lt;ref name="metro" /&gt; this fetish can only be acted upon in a limited number of ways. Primarily this is done through fantasy, involving either [[Masturbation|self stimulation]] or [[sexual roleplaying]] with a partner.&lt;ref name="ddiss" /&gt; ASFR art is therefore important to aid in the reinforcement of imagination.&lt;ref name="asfr" /&gt;

Art with ASFR content includes but is not limited to [[science fiction]] movies, music videos,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOKPuO-XLF4 Electrosexual Fetish (ASFR) Video Directed by Mashyno]&lt;/ref&gt; television shows, novels, short stories, illustrations, [[Digital image editing|manipulated photographs]], songs and even television commercials.&lt;ref name="exotic"&gt;"Wrong Turns Down The Sex-Info-Highway 5.07", by Martine Duplessis, ''Exotic Magazine'', 1996 [http://www.xmag.com/archives/5-07-jan98/sexhiway.html (web page)]&lt;/ref&gt; Such works are sought after by technosexuals since economically viable androids are not yet available. Realistic [[sex doll]]s such as the [[RealDoll]] may provide a way to explore this fetish with existing technology. Recent developments in robotics and [[artificial intelligence]], such as those seen in the [[Actroid]] or [[EveR-1]] may lead to the production of more advanced synthetic partners.&lt;ref name="asfr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="metro" /&gt;

It is also worth noting that some ASFRians do not wish to use synthetic partners at all, and instead would prefer human partners to participate in forms of fantasy play.&lt;ref name="ddiss" /&gt;

[[Image:Saltman2.jpg|thumb|Left shoe with lower leg of Salt Man 1]]
The '''Saltmen''' were discovered in the [[Chehrabad]] salt mines, located on the southern part of the Hamzehlu village, on the west side of the city of [[Zanjan (city)|Zanjan]], in the [[Zanjan Province]] in  [[Iran]]. By 2010, the remains of six men had been discovered, most of them accidentally killed by the collapse of galleries in which they were working.&lt;ref name="Aali2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Aali | first =Abolfazl | author-link = | last2 =Stöllner | first2 =Thomas | author2-link = | last3 =Abar | first3 =Aydin | author3-link = | last4 =Rühli | first4 =Frank | author4-link = | title = The Salt Men of Iran: The Salt Mine of Douzlākh, Chehrābād  | journal = Archäologisches Korrespondenzblatt | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–81 | publisher = Verlag des Römisch-Germanischen Zentralmuseums | location = Mainz | year = 2012 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = 0342-734X | doi = | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The head and left foot of Salt Man 1 are on display at the [[National Museum of Iran]] in [[Tehran]].

== Discovery ==
In the winter of 1993, miners came across a body with long [[hair]], a [[beard]] and some [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s. These included the remains of a body, a lower leg inside a [[leather]] [[boot]], three [[iron]] [[knife|knives]], a [[wool]]len half trouser, a [[silver]] [[Sewing needle|needle]], a [[sling (weapon)|sling]], parts of a leather [[rope]], a [[grindstone (tool)|grindstone]], a [[walnut]], some [[pottery]] shards, some patterned [[textile]] fragments, and a few broken [[bone]]s. The body had been buried in the middle of a tunnel approximately 45 metres in length.

In 2004, another salt miner found the remains of a second man. During archaeological excavations in 2005, the remains of another two well-preserved men were found. In 2006, the Iranian Cultural Heritage News Agency partnered with [[German Mining Museum]] in [[Bochum]] ([[Germany]]), in 2007 with [[University of Oxford]] and the Swiss [[University of Zurich]] for thorough investigations. A scientific long-term project was started, supported by [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] (DFG) and British funds.&lt;ref name="Aali2012"/&gt; Four corpses, including a teenager and a woman, are kept at the Archeology Museum (Zolfaghari House) in Zanjan. A sixth corpse found in the excavation campaign 2010 was left in place at the salt mine. Three hundred pieces of fabric were found, some of which retained designs and dyes. In 2008, the Ministry of Industries and Mines canceled the mining permit.&lt;ref name=phsmoi&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.pasthorizons.com/index.php/archives/06/2011/salt-men-of-iran | title = Salt men of Iran |date = June 7, 2011 | publisher = Past Horizons | accessdate = June 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
After archaeological studies which included [[Radiocarbon dating|C14 dating]] of different samples of bones and textiles, the Salt Man was dated to about 1,700 years ago. By testing a sample of hair, the [[Human blood group systems|blood group]] B+ was determined.

Visual characteristics included long hair and a beard, and a golden earring on the left ear indicated that he was likely a person of rank or influence. The reason for his presence and death in the salt mine of Chehrabad remains a mystery.

Three bodies are dated to the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] (247 BCE–224 CE) and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] (224–651 CE) eras, and the remainder to the [[Achaemenid Dynasty]] (550–330 BCE).&lt;ref name=phsmoi/&gt;

This brings new information on ancient diet, indicating the consumption of raw or undercooked meat and it also constitutes the earliest evidence of ancient intestinal parasites in Iran and contributes to the knowledge of gastrointestinal pathogens in the Near East.&lt;ref name="Nezamabadi" /&gt;

'''Science Research Associates Inc.''', commonly known as '''SRA''', is a [[Chicago]]-based publisher of educational materials and schoolroom reading comprehension products.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://www.sraonline.com/about_history.html SRA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Science Research Associates Inc. was founded in 1938.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; Early on, it had a trade and occupational focus. In 1957, it moved into individualized classroom instruction with the iconic SRA [[Reading (process)|Reading]] Laboratory Kit, a format that later translated to mathematics, science, and social studies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Commonly called '''SRA cards''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/lost-generation-finds-new-pride-20100604-xkiv.html|title=Lost generation finds new pride|first= Miranda |last= Devine|work= [[Sydney Morning Herald]]| date= 2010-06-05|accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the labs were large boxes filled with color-coded cardboard sheets. Each sheet included a reading exercise for students. Each student would have an independent topic, and would work on it independently of the other students in the class, consulting with the teacher only if they got stuck. The student would then follow up with [[multiple choice]] questions. As the child moved ahead, he or she would advance in difficulty.

SRA was purchased by [[IBM]] in 1964,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://ed-thelen.org/1401Project/Highlights-of-IBM-History.html| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071206054110/http://ed-thelen.org/1401Project/Highlights-of-IBM-History.html| website= ed-thelen.org| title= Highlights of IBM History| archivedate= December 6, 2007| access-date= July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by that time its products geared to primary and secondary schools had increased, especially at a time when math education was seen as critical during the [[Cold War]] and [[Space Race]]. Despite being an IBM subsidiary, SRA produced both [[IBM PC]] and [[Apple II]] software in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="pc198311"&gt;{{cite news | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=q8fwTt09_MEC&amp;lpg=RA1-PA696&amp;pg=RA1-PA265#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title=Cross Clues / Free Enterprise | work=PC Magazine | date=November 1983 | accessdate= 22 October 2013 | author=Advertisement | pages=263, 265}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maxwell Communications Corporation]] bought SRA in 1988. SRA became part of [[Macmillan/McGraw-Hill]] when the joint venture with [[McGraw-Hill]] was created in 1989. When Maxwell Communications collapsed, McGraw-Hill acquired full ownership of Macmillan/McGraw-Hill and SRA.

==Educational programs==
Since the 1960s, SRA has been the publisher of Direct Instruction programs, also known as [[DISTAR]] (Direct Instruction System for Teaching Arithmetic and Reading).  These include ''Language for Learning, Reading Mastery, Reasoning and Writing, Connecting Math Concepts'' and ''Corrective Reading''.  SRA purchased [[Open Court Reading]] in the 1990s.

In the early 2000s, the company was purchased by [[McGraw-Hill Education]] and the brand name and products are now part of the PreK-12 business of McGraw-Hill Education.  The ''Imagine It!'' reading program was launched in 2007.  McGraw-Hill Education also competes as a publisher of mathematics and science materials with programs such as ''Real Math, Number Worlds'' and ''Snapshots Video Science''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1682">[[File:Comedy and tragedy masks.svg|thumb|Comedy and tragedy masks]]
The '''sock''' and '''buskin''' are two ancient symbols of [[comedy]] and [[tragedy]]. In Greek theatre, actors in tragic roles wore a boot called a [[buskin]] (Latin ''cothurnus'') that elevated them above the other actors. The actors with comedic roles only wore a thin soled shoe called a [[Soccus|sock]] (Latin ''soccus'').

'''Sonic soot blowers''' offer a cost-effective and non-destructive means of preventing [[Incinerator bottom ash|ash]] and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate]] build-up within the [[power generation]] industry. They use high energy – low frequency [[sound wave]]s that provide 360° particulate de-bonding and at a speed in excess of 344 metres per second. Because they employ non-destructive sound waves, unlike steam [[soot blower]]s they eliminate any concerns over [[corrosion]], [[erosion]] or mechanical damage and do not produce an [[effluent stream]].



The sonic soot blower can in some ways be compared to a musical [[Reed (instrument)|reed instrument]] such as an [[oboe]], where the ‘base tone’ is created by blowing air over a reed and then converting this ‘base tone’ into a particular high or low note, depending on how far the sound wave has to travel along inside the body of the instrument.

The sonic soot blower operates in the same manner, the ‘base tone’ being produced by passing [[compressed air]] into a wave generator which houses a [[titanium]] diaphragm causing it to oscillate rapidly. This ‘base tone’ is then converted into a range of selected frequencies ranging from 350&amp;nbsp;Hz down to 60&amp;nbsp;Hz by the design and length of the [[horn section]], producing the desired [[sound frequency]] at a sound level approaching 200 dB. The sonic soot blower is usually ‘sounded’ for a few seconds at intervals of between 3 and 10 minutes. This ‘sounding’ pattern is normally controlled via the plant’s PLC. However, it may also be operated by such means as a [[SCADA]] system, individual timers on each [[solenoid valve]] or via a manual [[ball valve]].

==Construction==

Sonic soot blowers are normally constructed from fabricated, 316 grade [[stainless steel]] as opposed to some [[sonic horn]]s which are manufactured from heavy [[cast iron]].   For installations in harsher environments, such as high temperature or acidic gas streams, other types of stainless steels are used such as 310, 316 and 825.

==Performance==

Sonic soot blowers create a rapid series of very powerful sound induced pressure fluctuations which when transmitted into the ash or particulate, cause them to de-bond from other particles and from the [[heat transfer]] surface to which they are bonded and so carried away in the gas stream. This prevents the ash from building up and [[sintering]] onto the [[boiler]] tubes thus significantly reducing [[thermal efficiency]]. This is in contrast to the operating principles of steam soot blowers which are usually only employed at most once every eight hours by which time the ash has built up and baked hard onto the heat transfer surfaces. The steam soot blower then tries to blast away his hard deposit, usually only from the leading edge of the steam tubes.

==Advantages==

Sonic soot blowers are a proven alternative to conventional steam soot blowers in power generation plants which burn a range of [[fossil fuel]]s and other waste fuels including [[biofuel]]s. Depending on the application and boiler plant design, sonic soot blowers usually totally replace existing high maintenance steam soot blowers whether of the retractable or rotary type. In a few cases, sonic soot blowers can be used to supplement steam soot blowers.
Sonic soot blower cleaning technologies can be applied in [[superheater]]s, generating sections, [[economizer]]s, and airheaters as well as downstream equipment such as [[electrostatic precipitator]]s, [[Baghouse#Fabric_filters|baghouse filters]] and fans.

The main advantages of sonic soot blowers over [[Soot blower|steam soot blowers]] are:-

•	Elimination of opacity spikes due to more regular, more efficient cleaning
•	No structural damage to tube bundles or boiler structure
•	Elimination of tube corrosion and erosion problems
•	360° cleaning of all tube surfaces – not harsh leading edge tube cleaning as with steam soot blowers
•	Prevention of ash build up and sintering on steam tubes due to sonic soot blowers regular operation
•	Extremely low maintenance or operational costs
•	Eco-friendly – helps to combat global [[climate change]] and the effect of [[global warming]]

The '''Special Patrol Insertion/Extraction''' (SPIE) system was developed as a means to rapidly insert and/or extract a [[reconnaissance]] [[patrol]] from an area that does not permit a helicopter to land.  SPIE has application for rough terrain as well as water inserts/extracts. It is an adaptation of the [[Vietnam War]]-era [[STABO]] rig.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vietnamgear.com/kit.aspx?kit=661&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the SPIE rope is lowered into the pickup area from a hovering helicopter.  Patrol personnel, each wearing a harness with an attached [[carabiner]], hook up to a D-ring inserted in the SPIE rope.  A second safety line is attached to a second D-ring located above the first.  The helicopter lifts vertically from an extract zone until the rope and personnel are clear of obstructions, then proceeds in forward flight to a secure insert zone.  The rope and personnel are treated as an external load and airspeeds, altitudes, and oscillations must be monitored.&lt;ref&gt;FMFM 7-40 Helicopter Rope Suspension Training (HRST) Operations&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Coast Guard]] uses a similar technique to board ships when speed and stealth are required.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==History==
The Special Personnel Insertion/Extraction was first designed by the Marines of [[1st Force Reconnaissance Company]], the Marine division's [[1st Reconnaissance Battalion]], and the [[1st Marine Aircraft Wing]] riggers.  They created and combat tested several versions of the SPIE before it was officially recommended to be tested.  In May 1970, the commanding general of [[3rd Marine Expeditionary Force|3rd Marine Amphibious Force]] coordinated input from the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] and his [[1st Marine Air Wing]].  A request was sent to the [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]] and to the Development Center for certification of the SPIE rig and to its safety and use.&lt;ref name="Meyers, 1stFORECON"&gt;Bruce F. Meyers, ''Fortune Favors the Brave: The Story of First Force Recon,'' (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

The parachute test jumpers of the Naval Parachute Unit (NPU) and Marine Corps, all qualified parachutist designers and engineers, assembled together at [[Naval Air Facility El Centro|El Centro]] for the initial testing and evaluation of the SPIE rig.  After a few test dummies were tried, Marine Major Bruce F. Meyers, along with four Navy NPU parachutist engineers, successfully attempted the first flight on the SPIE assembly.

[[Star]]s of different mass and age have varying '''internal structures'''. Stellar structure models describe the internal structure of a star in detail and make detailed predictions about the [[luminosity]], the [[stellar classification|color]] and the [[stellar evolution|future evolution]] of the star.

==Energy transport==
[[File:Heat Transfer in Stars.png|350px|thumb|The different transport mechanisms of low-mass, intermediate-mass, and high-mass stars.]]

Different layers of the stars transport heat up and outwards in different ways, primarily [[convection]] and [[radiative transfer]], but [[heat conduction|thermal conduction]] is important in [[white dwarf]]s.

Convection is the dominant mode of energy transport when the temperature gradient is steep enough so that a given parcel of gas within the star will continue to rise if it rises slightly via an [[adiabatic process]]. In this case, the rising parcel is [[buoyant]] and continues to rise if it is warmer than the surrounding gas; if the rising particle is cooler than the surrounding gas, it will fall back to its original height.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hansen|Kawaler|Trimble|2004|loc=§5.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regions with a low temperature gradient and a low enough [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] to allow energy transport via radiation, radiation is the dominant mode of energy transport.

The internal structure of a [[main sequence]] star depends upon the mass of the star.

In stars with masses of 0.3–1.5 [[solar mass]]es ({{Solar mass|link=yes}}), including the [[Sun]], hydrogen-to-helium fusion occurs primarily via [[proton-proton chain]]s, which do not establish a steep temperature gradient. Thus, radiation dominates in the inner portion of solar mass stars. The outer portion of solar mass stars is cool enough that hydrogen is neutral and thus opaque to ultraviolet photons, so convection dominates. Therefore, solar mass stars have radiative cores with convective envelopes in the outer portion of the star.

In massive stars (greater than about 1.5 {{Solar mass|link=yes}}), the core temperature is above about 1.8×10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; [[Kelvin|K]], so [[hydrogen]]-to-[[helium]] [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] occurs primarily via the [[CNO cycle]]. In the CNO cycle, the energy generation rate scales as the temperature to the 15th power, whereas the rate scales as the temperature to the 4th power in the proton-proton chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt |Hansen|Kawaler|Trimble|2004|loc=Tbl. 1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the strong temperature sensitivity of the CNO cycle, the temperature gradient in the inner portion of the star is steep enough to make the core [[Convection zone|convective]]. In the outer portion of the star, the temperature gradient is shallower but the temperature is high enough that the hydrogen is nearly fully ionized, so the star remains transparent to ultraviolet radiation. Thus, massive stars have a [[Radiation zone|radiative]] envelope.

The lowest mass main sequence stars have no radiation zone; the dominant energy transport mechanism throughout the star is convection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt |Hansen|Kawaler|Trimble|2004|loc=§2.2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equations of stellar structure==
{{see also|Mass-luminosity relation|Polytrope}}
The simplest commonly used [[Stellar model|model]] of stellar structure is the spherically symmetric quasi-static model, which assumes that a [[star]] is in a [[steady state]] and that it is [[symmetry|spherically symmetric]]. It contains four basic first-order [[differential equations]]: two represent how [[matter]] and [[pressure]] vary with radius; two represent how [[temperature]] and [[luminosity]] vary with radius.&lt;ref&gt;This discussion follows those of, e.&amp;nbsp;g., {{harvtxt |Zeilik|Gregory|1998|loc=§16-1–16-2}} and {{harvtxt |Hansen|Kawaler|Trimble|2004|loc=§7.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In forming the '''stellar structure equations''' (exploiting the assumed spherical symmetry), one considers the matter [[density]] &lt;math&gt;\rho(r)&lt;/math&gt;, [[temperature]] &lt;math&gt;T(r)&lt;/math&gt;, total [[pressure]] (matter plus radiation) &lt;math&gt;P(r)&lt;/math&gt;, [[luminosity]] &lt;math&gt;l(r)&lt;/math&gt;, and energy generation rate per unit mass &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(r)&lt;/math&gt; in a spherical shell of a thickness &lt;math&gt;\mbox{d}r&lt;/math&gt; at a distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from the center of the star. The star is assumed to be in [[local thermodynamic equilibrium]] (LTE) so the temperature is identical for [[matter]] and [[photons]]. Although LTE does not strictly hold because the temperature a given shell "sees" below itself is always hotter than the temperature above, this approximation is normally excellent because the photon [[mean free path]], &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, is much smaller than the length over which the temperature varies considerably, i. e. &lt;math&gt;\lambda \ll T/|\nabla T|&lt;/math&gt;.

First is a statement of ''[[hydrostatic equilibrium]]:'' the outward force due to the [[pressure gradient]] within the star is exactly balanced by the inward force due to [[gravity]].  This is sometimes referred to as stellar equilibrium.
:&lt;math&gt; {\mbox{d} P \over \mbox{d} r} = - { G m \rho \over r^2 } &lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;m(r)&lt;/math&gt; is the cumulative mass inside the shell at &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]]. The cumulative mass increases with radius according to the ''[[continuity equation|mass continuity equation]]:''
:&lt;math&gt; {\mbox {d} m \over \mbox{d} r} = 4 \pi r^2 \rho .&lt;/math&gt;

[[Integral|Integrating]] the mass continuity equation from the star center (&lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt;) to the radius of the star (&lt;math&gt;r=R&lt;/math&gt;) yields the total mass of the star.

Considering the energy leaving the spherical shell yields the ''energy equation:''
:&lt;math&gt; {\mbox{d} l \over \mbox{d} r} = 4 \pi r^2 \rho ( \epsilon - \epsilon_\nu )&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the luminosity produced in the form of [[neutrinos]] (which usually escape the star without interacting with ordinary matter) per unit mass. Outside the core of the star, where nuclear reactions occur, no energy is generated, so the luminosity is constant.

The energy transport equation takes differing forms depending upon the mode of energy transport. For conductive energy transport (appropriate for a [[white dwarf]]), the energy equation is
:&lt;math&gt; {\mbox{d} T \over \mbox{d} r} = - {1 \over k} { l \over 4 \pi r^2 },&lt;/math&gt;
where ''k'' is the [[thermal conductivity]].

In the case of radiative energy transport, appropriate for the inner portion of a solar mass [[main sequence]] star and the outer envelope of a massive main sequence star,
:&lt;math&gt; {\mbox{d} T \over \mbox{d} r} = - {3 \kappa \rho l \over 64 \pi r^2 \sigma T^3},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] of the matter, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Stefan-Boltzmann constant]], and the [[Boltzmann constant]] is set to one.

The case of convective energy transport does not have a known rigorous mathematical formulation, and involves [[turbulence]] in the gas. Convective energy transport is usually modeled using [[mixing length theory]]. This treats the gas in the star as containing discrete elements which roughly retain the temperature, density, and pressure of their surroundings but move through the star as far as a characteristic length, called the ''mixing length''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hansen|Kawaler|Trimble|2004|loc=§5.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a [[monatomic]] [[ideal gas]], when the convection is [[adiabatic]], meaning that the convective gas bubbles don't exchange heat with their surroundings, mixing length theory yields
:&lt;math&gt; {\mbox{d} T \over \mbox{d} r} = \left(1 - {1 \over \gamma} \right) {T \over P } { \mbox{d} P \over \mbox{d} r},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma = c_p / c_v&lt;/math&gt; is the [[adiabatic index]], the ratio of [[specific heat]]s in the gas. (For a fully ionized [[ideal gas]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma = 5/3&lt;/math&gt;.) When the convection is not adiabatic, the true temperature gradient is not given by this equation. For example, in the Sun the convection at the base of the convection zone, near the core, is adiabatic but that near the surface is not. The mixing length theory contains two free parameters which must be set to make the model fit observations, so it is a [[phenomenology (particle physics)|phenomenological]] theory rather than a rigorous mathematical formulation.&lt;ref name="Ostlie"&gt;Ostlie, Dale A. and Carrol, Bradley W., [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0805304029 ''An introduction to Modern Stellar Astrophysics''], Addison-Wesley (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Also required are the [[equation of state|equations of state]], relating the pressure, opacity and energy generation rate to other local variables appropriate for the material, such as temperature, density, chemical composition, etc.  Relevant equations of state for pressure may have to include the perfect gas law, radiation pressure, pressure due to degenerate electrons, etc. Opacity cannot be expressed exactly by a single formula. It is calculated for various compositions at specific densities and temperatures and presented in tabular form.&lt;ref name="Rogers1996"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stellar structure ''codes'' (meaning computer programs calculating the model's variables) either interpolate in a density-temperature grid to obtain the opacity needed, or use a [[curve fitting|fitting function]] based on the tabulated values. A similar situation occurs for accurate calculations of the pressure equation of state. Finally, the nuclear energy generation rate is computed from [[nuclear physics]] experiments, using ''reaction networks'' to compute reaction rates for each individual reaction step and equilibrium abundances for each isotope in the gas.&lt;ref name="Ostlie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heger2002"&gt;{{Citation

Combined with a set of [[boundary conditions]], a solution of these equations completely describes the behavior of the star. Typical boundary conditions set the values of the observable parameters appropriately at the surface (&lt;math&gt;r=R&lt;/math&gt;) and center (&lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt;) of the star: &lt;math&gt;P(R) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, meaning the pressure at the surface of the star is zero; &lt;math&gt;m(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, there is no mass inside the center of the star, as required if the mass density remains [[Wikt:finite|finite]]; &lt;math&gt;m(R) = M&lt;/math&gt;, the total mass of the star is the star's mass; and &lt;math&gt;T(R) = T_{eff}&lt;/math&gt;, the temperature at the surface is the [[effective temperature]] of the star.

Although nowadays stellar evolution models describe the main features of [[color magnitude diagram]]s, important improvements have to be made in order to remove uncertainties which are linked to the limited knowledge of transport phenomena. The most difficult challenge remains the numerical treatment of turbulence.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Some research teams are developing simplified modelling of turbulence in 3D calculations.

==Rapid evolution==
The above simplified model is not adequate without modification in situations when the composition changes are sufficiently rapid. The equation of hydrostatic equilibrium may need to be modified by adding a radial acceleration term if the radius of the star is changing very quickly, for example if the star is radially pulsating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''[[Sustainability|Sustainable]] products''' are those products that provide environmental, social and economic benefits while protecting [[public health]] and [[Natural environment|environment]] over their whole life cycle, from the extraction of [[raw material]]s until the final disposal.

== Scope of definition ==
According to Belz, Frank-Martin.,&lt;ref&gt;Frank-Martin B. and Peattie, K. (2009). Sustainability Marketing: A Global Perspective. Wiley, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; the definition of sustainable product has six characteristics:
* [[Customer satisfaction]]: any products or services that do not meet customer needs will not survive in the market in a long term.
* Dual focus: compared with purely environmental products, sustainable products focus both on ecological and social significance.
* Life-cycle orientation: sustainable product is constantly environmental-friendly during its entire life. That is, from the moment the raw materials are extracted to the moment the final product is disposed of, there must be no permanent damage to the environment.
* Significant improvements: sustainable products have to contribute to dealing with socio-ecological problems on a global level, or provide measurable improvements in socio-ecological product performance.
* [[Continuous improvement process|Continuous improvement]]: since the state of knowledge, technologies and societal expectation keep on developing, so sustainable products should also be continuously improved regarding social and environmental variation.
* Competing offers: sustainable products may still lag behind competing offers, therefore, the competing offers may serve as a [[wikt:benchmark|benchmark]] regarding social and ecological performance.

[[Michael Braungart]] and [[William McDonough]]'s book ''[[Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things]]'' &lt;ref&gt;Michael Braungart and William McDonough (2002). Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things. North Point Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; expands on the life-cycle part of this definition. They suggest that we should make every material and product so that it can be disassembled when its use is over, and so that all the materials of which it is made can then be returned to the Earth after composting, or endlessly recycled as raw materials.

=== Sustainable product standards ===

=== Overall standards ===
'''Nordic Swan Ecolabel'''
The standard of [[Nordic swan|Nordic Swan Ecolabel]], which is distributed in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]] and [[Iceland]], mainly refers to distinguish products that have a positive effect on the environment. Or rather, it has climate requirements that limit the amount of CO2 emissions where it is most relevant.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nordic-ecolabel.org/criteria/product-groups/&lt;/ref&gt; More than 3,000 products, mainly household chemicals, paper products, office machinery and building materials have been issued with this label. The criteria account environmental factors through the product's life cycle (raw material extraction, production and distribution, use and refuse). Thus the most important parameters are consumption of natural resources and energy, emissions into air, water and soil, generation of waste and noise.

'''Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)'''

[[Global Reporting Initiative|GRI]] frames out and disseminates global sustainability reporting guidelines for ‘voluntary use by organizations reporting on the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of their activities, products and services’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalreporting.org/ReportingFramework/G31Guidelines/&lt;/ref&gt; According to GRI Guidelines, reporters should take into consideration stakeholders’ interests and use the [[social indicator]]s and others that more accurately depict the social and ecological performance of the organization.

'''Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)'''

[[Life-cycle assessment|LCA]] evaluates and discloses the environmental benefits of products over their full life cycle, from raw materials extraction to final disposition. Since 1997 the process of conducting LCA studies has been standardized by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO).

=== Product-oriented standards ===
'''Organic Food Labeling'''[[File:National Organic Program.jpg|thumb|right|The National Organic Program (run by the USDA) is responsible for the legal definition of organic in the United States and issue organic certification.]]
[[Organic food]] are foods that are produced using methods involving no agricultural synthetic inputs, for instance, synthetic [[pesticide]]s, [[chemical fertilizer]]s, [[genetically modified organism]]s (GMO), and are not processed using [[irradiation]], industrial [[solvent]]s, or chemical [[food additive]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Gary J. &amp; Albala, Ken, ed (2007). The business of food: encyclopedia of the food and drink industries. ABC-CLIO. p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the [[United States]], [[European Union]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]] and many other industrialized countries require food producers to acquire special critieria or certification to market their products as "organic". Apparently, organic food producers emphasize sustainable [[Conservation biology|conservation]] of the social-ecological attributes such as soil, water and the whole ecosystem. International organizations such as the [[Organic Consumers Association]] supervise the development of organic food. According to the [[National Organic Program]] (NOP) in the US, a voluntary green-and-white seal on foods’ packaging denotes that a product is at least 95% organic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/nop&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MSC Labeling'''

The [[Marine Stewardship Council]] (MSC) is an independent non-profit organization which was established in 1997 in order to cope with the [[overfishing]] problem. Fisheries that are assessed and meet the standard can use the MSC blue ecolabel. The MSC mission is to 'reward sustainable fishing practices’. As of the end of 2010, more than 1,300 fisheries and companies had achieved a Marine Stewardship Council certification.&lt;ref&gt;List of Companies certified to MSC. www.ekobai.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FSC Labeling'''

The [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC) is an international non-profit organization established in 1993 to ‘promote forest management that is environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial and economically viable’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsc.org&lt;/ref&gt; Its main responsibilities for achieving the goal are standard framing, independent certification issuing and labeling. FSC directly or indirectly addresses issues such as [[illegal logging]], [[deforestation]] and [[global warming]] and has positive effects on [[economic development]], [[environmental conservation]], [[poverty alleviation]] and social and political empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;effects of FSC Certification in Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Russia, Sweden and the UK. WWF (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Experiences with voluntary standards initiatives and related multi-stakeholder dialogues. B. Lang. GTZ (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fair Trade Labeling'''
[[File:EKO symbol RGB.jpg|right|thumb|[[EKOenergy]] is an ecolabel for energy in Europe]]
Although there is no universally accepted definition of [[fair trade]], Fair trade Labeling Organizations International (FLO) most commonly refer to a definition developed by FINE, an informal association of four international fair trade networks (Fair trade Labeling Organizations International, [[World Fair Trade Organization]] - formerly International Fair Trade Association, [[Network of European Worldshops]] and [[European Fair Trade Association]]): fair trade is a trading partnership, based on dialogue, transparency and respect, that seeks greater equity in international trade. It contributes to sustainable development by offering better trading conditions to, and securing the rights of, marginalized producers and workers – especially in the South. Fair trade organizations, backed by consumers, are engaged actively in supporting producers, awareness raising and in campaigning for changes in the rules and practice of conventional international trade.&lt;ref&gt;Fair Trade Labelling Organizations International www.fairtrade.net&lt;/ref&gt;

'''U. S. Green Building Council LEED Rating System'''

The LEED Green Building Rating System evaluates environmental performance of all buildings over their life, providing the definitive standard for what constitutes a [[Green building|"green" building]], persuading the consumer and building industry to develop products that are more environmentally and economically viable.&lt;ref&gt;LEEDv3". US Green Building Council. http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1970. Retrieved 20 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EKOenergy label'''

[[EKOenergy]] is an ecolabel originating in Finland. It is becoming the continent wide ecolabel for energy, which is supported by number European NGOs. It evaluates sustainability of electricity products on open energy markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.res-e.org |title= Renewable Electricity Standard for Europe|author= |year= 2012|work= RES-E Standard|publisher= RES-E Initiative Group|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green Seal'''

[[Green Seal]] is a North American non-profit ecolabel organization established in 1989. It generates life cycle-based sustainability standards for products, services and companies in addition to offering third party [[independent test organization]] certification for those meeting its standards. Green Seal was the first non-profit environmental certification program established in the [[United States]]. It currently has certified nearly 4,000 products and services within 400 categories.&lt;ref&gt;Sustainability at Yellowstone http://www.yellowstonenationalparklodges.com/environment/green-seal-certification/green-seal/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sustainable product policies ==
'''International'''

Since 1998, the branch of the '''[[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP)''' has undertaken several national programs or action plans on [[sustainable consumption]] and production.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP (2007), Assessment of Policy instruments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from Buildings.http://www.unep.org/themes/consumption/index.asp?page=home&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the [[United Nations]] is responsible for administrating the Marrakech Process&lt;ref&gt;http://esa.un.org/marrakechprocess/&lt;/ref&gt; and developing the ten-year Sustainable Consumption and Production Framework through Regional Marrakech Process Consultations, whose goal is to accelerate the shift towards sustainable consumption and production (SCP). 
'''[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD)'''’s Environmental Directorate has also done comprehensive work on the environmental impacts of sustainable consumption and production. One of current OECD projects is reviewing measures for sustainable manufacturing production.&lt;ref&gt;OECD (1999), Towards More Sustainable Household Consumption Patterns. http://www.oecd.org/document/58/0,2340,en_2649_34331_2397498_1_1_1_1,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Regions and countries'''

'''European Union''': on 16 July 2008 the [[European Commission]] presented the Sustainable Consumption and Production and Sustainable Industrial Policy (SCP/SIP) Action Plan&lt;ref&gt;European Commission (2011), [http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/escp_en.htm Sustainable Consumption and  Production and Sustainable Industrial  Policy Action Plan].&lt;/ref&gt; which clarifies the United Nations’ Marrakech Process on Sustainable Consumption and Production and global ten-year Sustainable Consumption and Production Framework and it is finally adopted by the Council on 4 December 2008 and is updated regularly. It includes a series of proposals on sustainable consumption and production to target EU goals for [[environmental sustainability]], [[economic growth]] and [[public welfare]], which are as follows:
* A proposal to extend mandatory labeling requirements which is relevant to the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of products according to the 1992 Energy Labeling Directive.
* A proposal to widen the covering fields of voluntary [[EU Ecolabel]] of products (e.g., including food and beverage products) and streamline the system.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sustainable-business/ecodesign/product-policy/index_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Energy label en.svg|thumb|right|Sample EU energy efficiency label]]
* A proposal for an independent communication on green public procurement. This communication identifies economic priority sectors, establishes common environmental criteria and  guides to implement green public procurement by Member States.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/publicprocurement/modernising_rules/conferences/index_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* A proposal for the revision of the EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) to enlarge the number of companies involved, including companies outside the EU, and decrease the administrative costs for Small and Mediums Sized Enterprises (SMEs).&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/environment/emas/index_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* Proposals on sustainable consumption and production that will contribute to improve the environmental efficiency of products and increase the demand for more pro-environmental goods and production technologies.

'''The [[United States]]''' government does not have a standardized national policy or strategy for sustainable consumption and production. However, the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) develops extensive sustainability programs on water, agriculture, energy, and ecosystem, etc. At the same time, the [[U.S. Department of State]]’s Sustainable Development Partnerships web page provides considerable information about the U.S. government's sustainable development initiatives to help other countries set up and implement their own development strategies in social and ecological terms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/oswer/international/factsheets/200810-sustainable-consumption-and-production.htm#UNEP&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[United Kingdom]]''' government considers Sustainable Consumption and Production is one of the four priority sectors identified in the 2005 UK Sustainable Development Strategy. The UK government is carrying out a series of actions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/economy/products-consumers/&lt;/ref&gt;  to achieve goals of sustainable consumption and production in public and private areas respectively.

'''Norwegian''' Ministry of the Environment founded [[Norway]]’s Green in Practice (GRIP), which is a public-private foundation established in 1996 to promote sustainable consumption and production. At the same time, Norway’s Ministry of Finance has primary responsibility to fund the strategy of sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;http://greennow.net/Felles/english.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Australia]]n''' government requires that certain electrical products for sale should contain mandatory energy-efficiency labeling to provide consumers with information that helps reduce energy use and green house gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energyrating.gov.au/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sustainable product design ==
{{See also|Sustainable design}}
Conventionally, [[environmental management system]]s have always addressed the impacts of products on local surroundings. ISO 14001 (ISO 14001:3) provides a formalized framework for managing significant environmental aspects and improving environmental performance through a ‘‘Plan, Do, Check, Review’’ continual improvement cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Donnelly K, Olds R, Blechinger F, Reynolds D and Beckett-Fumell Z (2004): [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225664765_ISO_14001_-_Effective_management_of_sustainable_design ISO 14001 – effective management of sustainable design]. The Journal of Sustainable Product Design 4:43–54.&lt;/ref&gt;
During the phase of [[product planning]], consumer demands and market opportunities are evaluated. At this time a product description and execution plans for a successful program launch are developed and product requirements are defined.
During the phase of product development, specific design specifications are finalized, models are built, and designs are reviewed and released for manufacture planning. Once manufacturing begins, the product is commercially launched for general availability and volume deployed to the marketplace. Once a [[prototype]] is available, LCA is used as a fundamental standard to identify significant social and environmental aspects and quantify environmental impact.
Once a product is launched into market and becomes commercialized, it enters the maturity phase, which means that the sales and the profits both reach the peak. The maturity phase contains two stages: during the first stage of maturity, the customer is utilizing the product. Modifications may still be made to the product to enhance or change it. The product enters the second stage of maturity when it approaches near to the decline phase. 
Where applicable, end-of-life products are taken back and subsequently reused or recycled efficiently. While being a legal requirement in the EU, the take back of end-of-life products offers the chance to review the final life cycle stage of a product through direct contact with recyclers. This knowledge can then be applied to future designs and product improvement.

'''TRIAD Berlin''' is a German [[exhibition design]] firm based in [[Berlin]] with an office in [[Shanghai]]. The agency is best known for the development of two major sports museums: the [[German Football Museum]] in [[Dortmund]] and the [[FIFA World Football Museum]] in [[Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dw.com/en/football-in-museums/av-19083717 |title=Football in museums|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=6 March 2016|accessdate=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
[[File:Expo 2010 Shanghai, Urban Planet Pavilion.jpg|thumb|''Urban Planet'' pavilion, Expo 2010 Shanghai]]
The Berlin agency was founded in 1994 by Lutz Engelke to realize the exhibition ''The Dream of Vision – Age of Televisions'' at [[Gasometer Oberhausen]] in the city of [[Oberhausen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/themen/koepfe/triad-berlin-eine-agentur-mit-der-besonderen-dna/12526828.html|title=Eine Agentur mit der besonderen DNA|publisher=[[Der Tagesspiegel]]|date=1 November 2015|access-date=2018-03-16|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; After designing the theme pavilion ''[[Expo 2010 pavilions#Urban Planet Pavilion|Urban Planet]]'' at [[Expo 2010]], the company also has an additional permanent office in Shanghai, [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2010-11/02/content_11489135.htm |title=How to build cities with character|publisher=[[China Daily]]|date=2 November 2010|accessdate=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency focusses on spatial communication and sees itself as a ''Think &amp; Do Tank''. Its main goal is to turn complex ideas into tangible experiences. Although the content of the projects varies, the method used for their development is always the same: the creation of stories that can be experienced from abstract ideas. A key component of this process is the development of a narrative that structures the messages and guides the visitor through the exhibition. Most of the times, the [[storytelling]] is enhanced by digital media. TRIAD exhibitions rely heavily on digital interactive exhibits with the intention of bridging the gap between the intellectual learning process and the physical experience. In many cases, TRIAD combines education and entertainment in a multimedia space. The result is the so-called [[Educational entertainment|edutainment]], whose goal is to educate through entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Engelke/Osswald, 2017, p. 964.&lt;/ref&gt;

TRIAD has applied edutainment concepts to various projects focused on children's education, such as the 2018 exhibition on the [[MS Wissenschaft]] about working life of the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ms-wissenschaft.de/english/ |title=MS Wissenschaft – The Floating Science Center|accessdate=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, the company has used this approach in the [[Brandenburg Gate Museum]] in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/emotionen-am-tor-the-gate-zeigt-stadtgeschichte-in-einer-multimedia-show/13511474.html|title="The Gate" zeigt Stadtgeschichte in einer Multimedia-Show|access-date=2017-03-01|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is also tackling other challenges that exhibitions face today, like the creation of barrier-free museums. An example of this is the exhibition ''Wilderness Dreams'' in [[Eifel National Park]] which is part of the [[United Nations Decade on Biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.undekade-biologischevielfalt.de/projekte/aktuelle-projekte-beitraege/detail/projekt-details/show/Wettbewerb/1863/?cHash=59202f3f0faf587a430c6400f5b54774&amp;L=0 |title=„Wildnis(t)räume im Nationalpark-Zentrum Eifel|accessdate=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''term''' is a period of [[wikt:duration|duration]], [[time]] or [[wikt:occurrence|occurrence]], in relation to an [[Phenomenon|event]]. To differentiate an [[Interval (time)|interval]] or duration, common phrases are used to distinguish the observance of [[length]] are near-term or short-term, medium-term or mid-term and long-term.

It is also used as part of a [[calendar]] [[year]], especially one of the three parts of an [[academic term]] and [[employment|working]] year in the [[United Kingdom]]: [[Michaelmas term]], [[Hilary term]] / [[Lent term]] or [[Trinity term]] / [[Easter term]], the equivalent to the [[Academic term#United States|American semester]]. In [[United States|America]] there is a [[United States midterm election|midterm election]] held in the middle of the four-year presidential term, there are also academic [[midterm exam]]s.

In '''[[economics]]''', it is the period required for economic agents to reallocate resources, and generally reestablish [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. The actual length of this period, usually numbered in years or decades, varies widely depending on circumstantial context. During the long term, all factors are variable.

In '''[[finance]]''' or financial operations of borrowing and investing, what is considered ''long-term'' is usually above 3 years, with ''medium-term'' usually between 1 and 3 years and ''short-term'' usually under 1 year.  It is also used in some countries to indicate a fixed term investment such as a [[term deposit]].

In law, the term of a [[contract]] is the duration for which it is to remain in effect (not to be confused with the meaning of "term" that denotes any [[contractual term|provision of a contract]]). A [[fixed-term contract]] is one concluded for a pre-defined time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9750">'''The Grand Teddy tea-rooms paintings''' is a collective name for three [[Distemper (paint)|glue distemper]] oval paintings executed by [[Édouard Vuillard]] for Le Grand Teddy tea-rooms in Paris in 1918. The largest is privately owned, but is sometimes exhibited. One of the smaller works (identified in Vuillard's notes as ''The Cafe'') was featured on an episode of the BBC television programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' which first broadcast on 19 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fake or Fortune? – Series 3 – 1.

==Origin==
The Grand Teddy tea-rooms paintings are three oval paintings in glue distemper on canvas by Édouard Vuillard commissioned by interior designer Francis Jourdain to hang on the walls of the Grand Teddy bar and cafe in Paris. They were painted in 1918. With the closure of the cafe in 1922, the paintings were bought by Jos Hessel, Vuillard's friend and art dealer.

==Subsequent history==

The largest (called ''Le Grand Teddy'') shows the fashionable patrons of the cafe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond the Easel: Decorative Painting by Bonnard, Vuillard, Denis, and Roussel, 1890–1930|first=Gloria Lynn|last=Groom|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was exhibited at the [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|Jewish Museum]] in New York City in May, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/events/edouard-vuillard-a-painter-and-his-muses/|title=Edouard Vuillard: A Painter and His Muses|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is 150 x 290&amp;nbsp;cm in an oval shape in landscape format.

==BBC's ''Fake or Fortune?''==
[[File:Edouard Vuillard The Cafe.jpg|thumb|''The Café'' (1918) by Edouard Vuillard]]
Keith Tutt, an author and scriptwriter from Norfolk, fell in love with the work of French post-Impressionist painter Édouard Vuillard during his art classes at [[Tonbridge School]] and purchased a painting, thought to be one of the two smaller Grand Teddy works, at auction for approximately UK£11,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otsociety.tonbridge-school.co.uk/news/article/date/2014/01/ot-painting-features-on-fake-or-fortune/|title=Old Tonbridgian Society|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contacted the BBC programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'', in an attempt to gain their help in authenticating his work.

Tutt's vertical oval painting, titled ''The Café'', depicts an oblique elevated view of a café interior, with a group of women seated on a [[banquette]]. It was thought to be one of the three paintings commissioned from Vuillard in 1918 to decorate "Le Grand Teddy". The main painting  of the commission, ''Le Grand Teddy'', is currently privately owned and kept in secure storage in [[Geneva, Switzerland]], and, at the time the program was made, it was the only one of the three known to still exist, and to have been fully confirmed as a genuine Vuillard. With assistance from art experts and archivists in Britain, France and the Netherlands, the program undertook an exhaustive investigation and analysis of the Tutt painting, and they were given special permission by the owners of ''Le Grand Teddy'' to view it, to examine it using infra-red and ultra-violet light, and to take minute samples of the paint and canvas for scientific analysis. This showed that both paintings were virtually identical, both in the type of canvas used, and the medium with which Vuillard had painted the works. This was a relatively unusual compound of animal glue and pigment, called [[Distemper (paint)|glue distemper]], which Vuillard had learned to use in his early career, while working as a theatrical scenery painter. He was thought to have chosen glue distemper for the Grand Teddy commission in part because its unvarnished matte surface did not reflect the bright electric lights then coming into common use. 

The program's team was also able to visit the [[Bibliotheque Nationale]] in Paris, where they discovered the original interior design drawings for ''Le Grand Teddy'', showing how the paintings would have been placed. An investigation of the provenance traced the ownership back from Tutt, through Robert Warren and a previous owner, to British theatrical manager [[Charles B. Cochran|Charles Cochran]]. The program's art historian [[Bendor Grosvenor]] was able to locate an article in ''[[Windsor Magazine]]'', from 1933, which specifically mentioned both ''The Café'' and ''The Oysters'' as being in Cochran's possession at the time. Following the clue provided by a damaged shipping label on the back of ''The Café'', the program was finally able to locate contemporary Dutch newspaper reviews from 1926, which described both paintings in great detail, and thus confirming that after the Grand Teddy had closed, Vuillard's dealer [[:fr:Jos Hessel|Jos Hessel]] had placed the two smaller paintings in an exhibition in the Netherlands, from where they were thought to have been seen and purchased by Cochran. 

After submitting all the evidence to a committee at the secretive and highly conservative [[Wildenstein Institute]] in Paris, Tutt and the ''Fake or Fortune?'' team learned that the committee had unanimously agreed ''The Café'' to be a genuine work, and that it would henceforward be incorporated into the ''[[catalogue raisonné]]'' of Vuillard. As a result of this validation, the painting was estimated to be worth at least UK£200,00–£300,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nJx4x5I5j4 BBC TV - ''Fake or Fortune?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==The missing work==
Following their ''Fake or Fortune''  programme, the BBC issued an appeal to trace the missing third painting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-22030020|title=Missing painting sought by BBC|date=4 April 2013|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; purchased on [[eBay]] in 2005 and now with an estimated value of £250,000.&lt;ref name="Indy" /&gt;
