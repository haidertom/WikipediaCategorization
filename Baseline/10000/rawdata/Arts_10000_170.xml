{{italic title}}
'''''America 500 Years''''' is the title of a series of paintings created in 1988–91 by [[Nabil Kanso]] in commemoration of the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America. The works in the series base their subjects on historical events in the Americas over the course of five centuries.&lt;ref&gt;''Nabil Kanso: The Split of Life Paintings'', pp. 103–120, NEV Editions, Atlanta, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''America 500 Years'' series of paintings comprise a wide range of works&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/media.html Approximately 30 works,''Visions from America'']&lt;/ref&gt; including 9 mural-scale paintings executed in oil applied in rhythmic succession of vigorous brushwork infusing patterns and textures of varying density with intense tones of predominantly blue-black figures set against a combination of orange, red, and yellow ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/text.html ''Kanso: America series of paintings'']&lt;/ref&gt;
The compositions divide the canvas space into distinct sections within a planar layout constituting the basis for constructing a scene of separate parts offering variations of viewpoints in their contrast between subject matter and technique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/media.html Visions from America]&lt;/ref&gt; The pictorial organization conveys a volumetric presence of highly condensed images in juxtaposed planes expanding their irregular shaped boundaries near the top of the canvas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/text.html ''America series of paintings'']&lt;/ref&gt; The relation between them is important for an overall understanding of the picture and its meaning.

==Paintings in the series==
1 – '''''Discovery''''' measuring {{convert|3.65|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} tall and {{convert|4.50|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} wide&lt;ref&gt;''America 500 Years: Glory and Cruelty'', pp. 104–105, NEV Editions, Atlanta, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; depicts the first landing of [[Christopher Columbus]] in the [[New World]] in a scene divided in two parts corresponding to two worlds, one posed by the arrival of Columbus, the other inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|natives]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/discovery.html ''Discovery: Between Space and Time'']&lt;/ref&gt; At the forefront of the right section stands a figure representing Columbus with a fierce look resting one hand on his sword, the other raising the cross. A silhouetted figure rises behind him with one arm raised and one stretched toward two sails above an assemblage of figures and objects that include a rearing [[horses in warfare|horse]], a figure in body [[armor]], a mariner's [[compass]], [[gunpowder]] and [[cannon]]s alluding to some of the equipments and instruments brought by Columbus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/discovery.html ''Between Space and Time'']&lt;/ref&gt; The left part depicts an eagle and a group of figures that may represent the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] or [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] natives, referred by Columbus as  [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/discovery.html ''Discovery'']&lt;/ref&gt;

2 – '''''Encounter''''' 3.65 × 5.50 meters (12 × 18&amp;nbsp;ft) depicts a scene reflecting the encounter between [[Hernán Cortés]], the Spanish [[conquistador]] and [[Montezuma II|Montezuma]], ruler of the [[Aztec empire]].&lt;ref&gt;''Glory and Cruelty'', pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; The scene entails two sections separated by a V-shaped space formed by the intersecting fall of a figure [[warrior]] and an eagle as a [[metaphor]] for the Aztec [[Cuauhtémoc|fallen eagle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/encounter.html ''Encounter: America Series of Paintings'']&lt;/ref&gt; The right plane shows a dominant figure personating Cortés with a steering look reaching for his sword drawn over two struggling figures. He leans backward upon a female figure representing his interpreter and mistress known as [[la Malinche]]. The upper area shows a screaming figure with wide-flung arms arching a wild-looking horse above the figures of a priest and a soldier.&lt;ref name="Encounter"&gt;[http://america500years.com/encounter.html ''Encounter'']&lt;/ref&gt; The left section depicts a figure representing Montezuma holding a flower necklace. His posture orients a triangular shaped plane fitted with a group of figures, a [[Plumed Serpent|Serpent]] and objects with symbolic forms.&lt;ref name="Encounter" /&gt;

3 – '''''Covenant''''' 3.65 × 5.50 meters (12 × 18&amp;nbsp;ft)&lt;ref&gt;''Glory and Cruelty'', pp. 108–109&lt;/ref&gt; depicts a scene based on the subject of the arrival in America of the early settlers known as the [[Pilgrims]] who wrote the governing  [[Mayflower Compact|Compact]] aboard the [[Mayflower]] ship that landed at [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]]. The painting's two sections are parted at the top center by a red-yellow sun amid a whirlwind of pendulous shaped forms extending themselves over the entire picture surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/covenant.html ''Covenant: America Series of Paintings'']&lt;/ref&gt; At the top right side, dripping lines around the sun seem to give shape to the sail of a ship and overlap three joined figures that may refer to the signatories of the Covenant. Below them are thrusting figures reflecting [[Native Americans in the United States|natives]] appear with offerings such as plants and staples. The lower forefront shows a clergyman above a female figure leaning backward and holding in her hand a torched broom in flame alluding to the [[Salem witch trials]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/covenant.html ''Covenant'']&lt;/ref&gt;

4 – '''''Birth 1776''''' (3.65 × 5.50 meters)&lt;ref&gt;''Glory and Cruelty'', pp. 110–111&lt;/ref&gt; depicts a scene on the [[American Revolution]] and [[American Independence|Independence]] in a composition that divides the canvas in two parts linked at the center by a massive tree extending its branches in all directions scattering a wild assortment of shapes suggesting "organic cells that seem to subdivide and float around the figures."&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/birth.html ''Birth 1776: America Series'']&lt;/ref&gt; A fearless eagle sits at the top against a background of red and white stripes reflecting the [[American flag]] in a space dotted with stars and an image of the [[Liberty Bell]]. The area along the sides of the tree trunk shows the faces of [[George Washington]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref name="Birth 1776"&gt;[http://america500years.com/birth.html ''Birth 1776'']&lt;/ref&gt; The left and right sections are linked by the tree trunk in establishing a unified base line projecting forms of [[muskets]] and rifles.&lt; &lt;ref name="Birth 1776" /&gt;

5 – '''''Branching''''' (3.65 × 5.50 meters),&lt;ref&gt;''Glory and Cruelty'', pp. 112–113&lt;/ref&gt; continues the motif of the tree in ''Birth 1776'' with a tripartite scene on the war of liberation and independence in Latin America depicting a "ponderous tree-trunk that builds a pathway"&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/branching.html ''Branching: America series'']&lt;/ref&gt; throughout the picture. The structured planes are surrounded by light bluish space containing forms reflecting the faces of [[Simón Bolívar]], [[José de San Martín]], [[Antonio Sucre]], [[Francisco de Miranda]], [[Miguel Hidalgo]], and  [[José María Morelos|José Morelos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/branching.html ''Branching'']&lt;/ref&gt;

6 – '''''Chains Under a Blinding Sun''''' (3 × 5.50 meters)&lt;ref&gt;''Glory and Cruelty'', pp. 114–115&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the subject of  [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] depicting a three-part scene reflecting dark blue figures within a compressed space of deep yellow planes under a partial view of a hazy sun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/chains.html ''Chains Under a Blinding Sun: America Series'']&lt;/ref&gt; Long pendulous shapes with circumventing rings emerge from both sides and converge at the center with dripping lines over chained and struggling figures and symbols of [[enslavement]], [[hanging]], [[lynching]], and [[torture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/chains.html ''Chains Under a Blinding Sun'']&lt;/ref&gt;

7 – '''''Bleeding Eagles''''' (3 × 5.50 meters)&lt;ref&gt;''Glory and Cruelty'', pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt; bases its subject on [[Native American in the United States|Native Americans]] with a scene imparting various allusions, symbolism and contrasting elements. The composition sets intense dark blue figures inside two fire-red rectangular planes whose upper parts recede outward creating a wide V-shaped central section dominated by two fighting eagles. They span their wings in a crisscross formation scattering flying feathers over a grey-white space defined by bluish flowing forms outlining drawn faces of native chiefs [[Pontiac (person)|Pontiac]], [[Chief Joseph|Joseph]], [[Cochise]], [[Crazy Horse]], [[Black Hawk (Sauk leader)|Black Hawk]], [[Red Cloud]], and [[Sitting Bull]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/eagles.html ''Bleeding Eagles: America Series of Paintings'']&lt;/ref&gt; Above the chiefs' heads and across the upper plane, sweeping shapes of red strips with black-blue contours fuse with flowing lines of varying densities. They appear dripping over the entire image highlighting the movement and tension of the scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/eagles.html ''Bleeding Eagles'']&lt;/ref&gt;

8 – '''''North-South Split''''' (3.65 × 5.50) meters&lt;ref&gt;''Glory and Cruelty'', pp. 118-119&lt;/ref&gt; deals with the subject of the [[American Civil War]] in a scene composed in three sections demarcated at the edges by a white-bluish space that seems to widen around the upper middle part with floating forms outlining on one side the face of [[Abraham Lincoln]], and on the other, the faces of [[Robert E Lee]] and [[Stonewall Jackson]]. Their heads are turned toward the central image showing a female figure diving over a child falling between two opposing figures that personify the fighting between the [[Confederate Army|Confederate]] and [[Union Army|Union]] armies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/split.html ''North-South Split: America Series'']&lt;/ref&gt; The right side plane is occupied by dark-blue figures surrounded by circular forms of chains breaking and loosening within the organism of a compressed space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/split.html ''North-South Split'']&lt;/ref&gt; The left side shows figures, elements, and symbols reflecting some events that may allude to the [[Mexican–American War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/split.html ''North-South'']&lt;/ref&gt;

9 – '''''Glimmering Dawn''''' (3.65 × 5.50 meters)&lt;ref&gt;''Glory and Cruelty'', pp. 120&lt;/ref&gt; depicts a three-part composition with an atmospheric evocation of the twentieth century. It is suggested that "the attitudes and motions of the figures and forms appear defined by webs of fire-lit strings" &lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/dawn.html ''Glimmering Dawn: America Series'']&lt;/ref&gt; descending from different directions with a focus at the top of the central section occupied by an umbrella shaped sphere conjuring the threat of an atomic explosion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://america500years.com/dawn.html ''Glimmering Dawn'']&lt;/ref&gt; White-blue strips flowing with figure forms surround the three sections.

'''''Architecture Media Politics Society''''' (AMPS) is a nonprofit academic research organisation. Its associated peer reviewed [[open access]] online journal is Architecture_MPS &lt;ref&gt;http://www.architecturemps.com&lt;/ref&gt; ISSN 2050-9006. It was set up in 2011 and the journal officially launched in 2012. Since 2015 it has been published by UCL Press. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/uclpress/amps;jsessionid=41ed683a0noqp.victoria&lt;/ref&gt;  It is dedicated primarily to the study of [[architecture]] but examines it in the context of what it refers to as the mediated environment of contemporary  [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.architecturemps.com&lt;/ref&gt;

It was set up after a research bid to the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]], AHRC, for the project it hosted between 2012-2014; "Architecture as Political Image". It is an independent organisation that runs its research programmes in collaboration with multiple universities. It is based the United Kingdom.

==Research Programmes==

In 2014 AMPS launched a research programme called The Mediated City.&lt;ref&gt;http://architecturemps.com/the-mediated-city&lt;/ref&gt;  Investigating the role and influence of new technologies of the use, experience and representation of ‘the city’ it involves conferences and publications. The first two conferences were held in London and Los Angeles in 2014. In 2016 three books were published related to the programme: The publisher is Intellect Books. the series is called 'Mediated Cities'. 

In 2015 AMPS launched a three-year programme examining affordable housing provision internationally involving collaborations with universities, art groups, resident associations and scholars. It involves projects in several countries. The programme is called Housing - Critical Futures.&lt;ref&gt;http://architecturemps.com/housing-critical-futures&lt;/ref&gt; It involves conferences in the UK, Spain, Cyprus, Australia, China and elsewhere. The publishers engaged in this program are UCL Press and Libri Publishing. 

==Journal==

The Architecture_MPS journal publishes eight articles per year.It has an associated resource repository &lt;ref&gt;Glasgow School of Art Library Blog. New Online Journal-Architecture_MPS. Feb 2, 2013. http://gsaarchitecture.blogspot.in/2013/02/new-online-journal-architecturemps.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://periodiques.wordpress.com/2013/01/10/architecture-media-politics-society/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://respatrimoni.wordpress.com/2013/01/04/cfp-architecture-media-politics-society/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dgeneratefilms.com/uncategorized/emancipating-the-image-new-article-on-meishi-street-at-a_m_p_s&lt;/ref&gt;  discussed on academic forums such as Humanities and Social Sciences online&lt;ref&gt;http://www.h-net.org/announce/show.cgi?ID=196731&lt;/ref&gt; and the Joint Information Systems Committee.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=MECCSA-PGN;b301330.1209&lt;/ref&gt; 

The journal's subject areas and interests are open and encompass a range of subjects related to architecture. The themes of architecture, media, politics and society are interpreted broadly but the principal aim has been described as encouraging an “examination of how architecture operates in tandem with other cultural factors”.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Lisel. Article 6. November. 2012: Series 2: AMPS. Theory and Writing on the border of architecture, performance and installation. http://intangibleplaces.wordpress.com/series-2/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Turner Contemporary.jpeg|thumb|The Turner Contemporary, Margate, UK. From: The Mythopoetics of the Kuntshalle. Manuel Schvartzberg. AMPS. Vol. 1, No.2]]  --&gt;
Articles about urban design, cultural conflict in cities and the use of architecture in political campaigns in the United States. They sit alongside articles about the use of [[modernist architecture]] as a political tool in post revolutionary [[Mexico]] and the 'political role' of the built environment in the 'cultural industries' in the UK. It has an international perspective and a global editorial team. Its combination of journal and resource repository and its association with information professionals has been labeled as an “innovative” and “new” approach to academic publishing.&lt;ref&gt;Martí Capitanachi, Daniel Rolando. (ed). “AMPS: new on-line publishing”. In: RUA. Year, 4. No. 8. August - December 2012, Universidad Veracruzana, Xalapa.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James, Graham and Rachel Isaac-Menard."Architecture in the mediated environment of contemporary culture; a new forum for research and communication". In: ACSA News Digest. Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture. New York. December, 2012, volume 4.https://www.acsa-arch.org/acsa-news/read/read-more/acsa-news/2012/12/04/architecture-in-the-mediated-environment-of-contemporary-culture-a-new-forum-for-research-and-communication&lt;/ref&gt; The journal also publishes a range of interviews with leading academics, architects and critics.

==Interview-article==

AMPS has also developed a new genre of writing; the ‘interview-article’- an adaptation of the standard interview format and the academic article. It includes pieces from [[Kenneth Frampton]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], [[Michael Sorkin]], and [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;http://architecturemps.com/back-issues/&lt;/ref&gt; It is a variation on the interview genre in which theoretical background is added for the reader through extensive and discursive notation that expand on the arguments and references made by the interviewer or the interviewee. It is an explanatory / descriptive adaptation of the standard interview format that makes it a hybrid academic form of writing.&lt;ref&gt;http://instituteformodern.co.uk/tag/architecture&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hosted projects==

The journal periodically hosts a research project from a given scholar. In 2012 that project was entitled “Architecture as Political Image” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://architecturemps.com/architecture-as-political-image/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121218222631/http://architecturemps.com/architecture-as-political-image/ |archivedate=2012-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and investigated the appropriation of architecture in political campaign imagery in the United States and the United Kingdom. 
[[File:Aylesbury Estate View.jpg|thumb|The Aylesbury Housing Estate,Walworth, South East London UK, 51.486°N 0.085°W.]] 
This project has been covered at various academic conferences including the 2011 [[Oxford University]] Visual Literacies conference and has been the subject of numerous book articles.&lt;ref&gt;Cairns, Graham. “Advertising, architecture and politics – a semiotic analysis”. In: Exploring Visual Literacy Inside, Outside and through the Frame, A. Conner Farris and F. Pattenden, eds.

In: Universidad de La Salle Bajío. León, Guanajuato. Mexico. Coloquio Internacional de Arquitectura. Facultad de Arquitectura. 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a 3 part model to analyse the relationship between politics, advertising and architecture.It underlines the argument that the strategies used in political communication emerged from the [[Public relations|PR]] and advertising industries and, as a result, the political use of architectural imagery is similar to that found in commercial promotion. In this light, politics and architecture are seen as intertwined with what the project defines as a game of images.&lt;ref&gt;M Furnival, Marc. (ed). Advertising, Politics and Architecture. In: Id of the Ingenu. http://idoftheingenu.blogspot.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; The project outlines a historical narrative that traces this appropriation of architectural imagery back to the 18th century but primarily examines Post World War II elections in the US and the UK. These elections are examined alongside the most recent elections; the [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008]], the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010]] and the [[United States elections, 2012]].

'''Art in Sierra Leone''' has a long and significant tradition of carving and ceremonial works like masks and cloth for initiation and protection. Although art styles are oftentimes ascribed to a single ethnic group (often the [[Mende people|Mende]]), the styles and processes are spread throughout the country and many artists move between the different ethnic groups in the country.{{sfn|Hart|1989|p=45}}{{sfn|Cromwell|1977|p=79}}

Art is often practiced by organized societies, whether the traditional [[Sande society|Sande]] and [[Poro]] societies or the more recent ''odelay'' societies of [[Freetown]], and express a range of spiritual and political meanings. Carving using wood, ivory, and stone has been prominent for many centuries and retains importance today. In addition, since the 1930s, Freetown has had a number of ''lanterns'' competitions where different groups construct large, decorative floats.

==Artistic societies and groups==

===Sande and Poro Societies===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 74.64 Helmet Mask ndoli jowei for Sande Society.jpg|thumbnail|Sande mask. ([[Brooklyn Museum]])]]
{{main|Sande society|Poro}}
The Sande (female) and Poro (male) ceremonial societies have a long history of artistic construction in many different ethnic groups of Sierra Leone. Although most often affiliated with the [[Mende people|Mende]], these societies exist widely in the ethnic groups of Sierra Leone including in the [[Temne people|Temne]], the [[Kono people|Kono]], the [[Vai people|Vai]], and [[Bullom languages]] communities.{{sfn|Cromwell|1977|p=79}}

The Sande and Poro societies, which are primarily tasked with the initiation ceremonies for women and men to become a part of the community, produce an important range of artwork associated with the ceremony.{{sfn|Cromwell|1977|p=79}} One of the most prominent artistic forms associated with these societies are the helmet masks (called ''sowei'' in Mende and ''anawu'' in Temne) involved in the initiation rituals.{{sfn|Cromwell|1977|p=79}}

===Odelay societies===
[[File:Temne. Ode-Lay Mask Brooklyn Museum.jpg|thumb| Odelay mask by [[Temne people]]. [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]
Sierra Leone did not develop a significant artistic tradition of patriotic imagery during the struggle for independence and after. However, after the [[1992 Sierra Leonean coup d'état]], youth groups (''odelay societies'') formed and began engaging in high-profile art with patriotic themes.{{sfn|Opala|1994|p=198}} Prominent figures depicted were [[Bai Bureh]] or [[Joseph Cinqué|Sengbe Pieh]] in the lanterns and masks by the odelay societies in Freetown.{{sfn|Opala|1994|p=199}} In addition to historical heroes, the art often depicts National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) leaders and symbols (such as [[Valentine Strasser]] and [[Solomon Musa]]).{{sfn|Opala|1994|p=205}}

==Woodworking==
[[File:Apaf5.jpg|thumbnail|Wood figure of the Mende people]]
In general, there are clear regional differences in the wood carving techniques of the forest communities (the Mende, Vai, and Bullom) with smooth edges and intricate details. The savannah style (the Temne Limba, and Loko communities), in contrast, is defined by abstract styles with straight lines and bold contrasts.{{sfn|Hart|1989|p=45}}

Twin figures are prominent in Temne cultural practice and the wood carvings play a key role in the ceremonial life of the community. These figures of no more than a foot tall are created with a twin child passes away, and are used initially as a play partner for the living twin and as a ceremonial site for the mother.{{sfn|Lamp|2008|p=51}}

The twin figures are carved into a number of other ceremonial related wood, including staffs for religious initiation and healing.{{sfn|Lamp|2008|p=53}}  Associated with these figures is the construction of small-scale houses for the twin (called ''ka-bangka'' in Temne) which are spread throughout the area.{{sfn|Lamp|2008|p=51}} This use of twin figures is associated with wider spiritual powers that twins are claimed to possess in Temne beliefs.{{sfn|Lamp|2008|p=56}}

==Stone and ivory carving==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 2000.93.1 Figure of a Man Holding a Crocodile (2).jpg|thumbnail|Nomoli stone carving of a man holding a crocodile. ([[Brooklyn Museum]])]]
Ivory carvings have been produced by many of the ethnic groups in the current area of Sierra Leone and were a primary export to Portuguese traders when they first began the trade networks with the coastal communities.{{sfn|Cromwell|1977|p=79}} It was not until the 1950s that the stylistic connections between the ivory pieces and the large stone carvings which were discussed significantly by European sources earlier in that century.{{sfn|Lamp|1990|p=48}}

The ''nomoli'' or ''pomdo'' stone carvings of unclear origin have been discovered buried around southern Sierra Leone.  The figures were first described by Europeans in 1852 by missionary George Thompson who discovered a group of five of them on the site of a destroyed village.{{sfn|Fraser|1971|p=393}} The human figures, carved out of [[soapstone]], are found throughout a large area that was controlled primarily by the Temne until the Mende entered in the 1600s.{{sfn|Lamp|1983|p=219}} When asked about the statues by early explorers, the people in the region expressed the belief that they were the work of spiritual beings and that no one in the communities knew how to make such a figure.{{sfn|Lamp|1983|p=220}}{{sfn|Fraser|1971|p=393}}

The Mende believe the stones are the representations of the people who lived in the region before they came to the area and the Temne people have a ceremony around the stones where they treat them as former chiefs and kings of the region.{{sfn|Lamp|1983|p=220}}{{sfn|Lamp|1983|p=237}} African art curator Frederick Lamp believes that the stone carvings are a Temne tradition which was lost when the Mende invaded and displaced the communities which had existed there before that.{{sfn|Lamp|1983|p=230}}

==Cloth work==
[[File:Sierra Leonian - Ivory Pyx with Scenes from the Passion of Christ - Walters 71108 - View D.jpg|thumb|right|Ivory carving of approximate 1500s origin from Sierra Leone]]
Cloth arts are often used in many of the different groups in Sierra Leone to provide special types of protection. The cloth is provided with specific designs for spiritual protection for the wearer.{{sfn|Cromwell|1977|p=79}}

==Lanterns==
A prominent modern artistic expression involves the design and floating of ''lanterns'' down the river in [[Freetown]], the capital of the country.{{sfn|Oram|1998|p=50}} From 1961 until 1991, the Young Men's Muslim Association (YMMA) held competitions where various different civil groups would design large floats, often with lights inside or outside, in celebration of Ramadan.{{sfn|Oram|1998|p=50}} The lanterns are constructed out of wood, bamboo, wire, paper, rice and other materials and represent landmarks, animals, or supernatural beings.{{sfn|Oram|1998|p=52}}

The lantern festival began small in the 1930s when the businessman Daddy Maggay witnessed a Catholic lantern festival in the Gambia.{{sfn|Nunley|1985|p=45}} The small processions slowly grew, largely as a result of the reputation for good cooking by Maggay's wife (whose specialty was corn and couscous), and eventually became run by the YMMA.{{sfn|Nunley|1985|p=45}}

As the competition grew, violence occasionally broke out and the event grew larger and larger.{{sfn|Nunley|1985|p=45}} The events and lanterns often have political themes related to the issues in Sierra Leone at the time and are affiliated with various movements.{{sfn|Nunley|1985|p=45}} The regular holding of the lantern competition was ended in 1991 by the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war]], but irregular competitions still are held.{{sfn|Oram|1998|p=50}}

[[File:Astuvansalmi hirvia.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Elk]]s, people and a boat at Astuvansalmi.]]
The '''Astuvansalmi rock paintings''' ({{lang-fi|Astuvansalmen kalliomaalaukset}}) are located in [[Ristiina]], [[Mikkeli]], [[Southern Savonia]],  [[Finland]] at the shores of the lake [[Yövesi]], which is a part of the large lake [[Saimaa]]. The paintings are 7.7 to 11.8 metres above the water-level of lake [[Saimaa]]. The lake level was much higher at the time the rock paintings were made. There are about 70 paintings in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/220/ The Rock paintings of Astuvansalmi at Ristiina], [[World Heritage Convention]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rock paintings were officially found by the Finnish archaeologist Pekka Sarvas in 1968, though locals knew of them before that.

==Astuvansalmi site==
The rock where the paintings are located looks like a human head, the form especially visible during wintertime when viewed from the ice of the lake. The rock has presumably been some kind of a cult or ceremony site. The images of elk in Finnish rock paintings may be related to ‘animal ceremonialism’, whereupon the continuity of the hunted species is guaranteed
by a ritual in which the animal is sent back to its ‘owner’.&lt;ref name=lahelma /&gt;

The oldest paintings were made about 3000–2500 BC. They are located at the highest level (about 11 metres). The water level changed rapidly (about 2.5 metres) with the landslide of [[Vuoksi]]. Later on the level slowly went down 8 metres to its present level. All the later paintings were made from boats during the different historical water-levels.

[[File:Astuvansalmen kalliolippa.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The rock that sheltered Astuvansalmi paintings from [[erosion]].]]Other archeological artefacts have been found on the site, at the bottom of the lake, among them small amber statuettes of old gods ([[Ukko]] and [[Akka (Spirit)|Akka]]). Some animal jewellery was also found, one showing a bear head. The jewellery and statuettes refer to some religious ceremonies held on the site.

Arrowheads have also been found, dated to 2200–1800 BC and 1300–500 BC.

Stone age settlements from about 3300–2800 BC have been found near Astuvansalmi in Heiniemi.

==Motifs==
The Astuvansalmi rock paintings contain the following pictures: 18 to 20 elk, about as many human figures, tens of hands and animal tracks, 8 to 9 boats, and geometrical figures and pictures that are thought to show a fish and a dog.&lt;ref name=lahelma&gt;{{cite web|title= A Touch of Red : Archaeological and Ethnographic Approaches to Interpreting Finnish Rock Paintings |author= Antti Lahelma |url=https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/19406/atoucho.pdf |pages= 15, 46, 257–259 |publisher= The Finnish Antiquarian Society | quote= – – the large number of elk in Finnish rock paintings associates them with hunting, but not in the traditional sense of hunting magic. Instead, the paintings were done in order to return the hunted elk to their ‘owner spirit’, which she identified with the ‘Lady with the Bow’ at Astuvansalmi. According to Siikala, this image is likely to represent a being of the spirit world, since among modern circumpolar cultures, special taboos exist concerning women and game: “the very presence of a woman in hunter’s quarters might defile the hunting tackle, making [it] unfit for use” (Siikala 1981: 94). In Siikala’s view, then, rock paintings were to be understood as places where the shaman could contact the ‘keeper’ of the elk species. |publication-date= 2008|accessdate=22 Feb 2014}}{{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings could have a link to the [[Shamanism in Siberia|Siberian]] and North [[Shamanism in Europe|European shamanistic tradition]], where the sun was thought to be a deer or an elk running through the sky. The [[Lapps]] (or [[Sami people]]) also had a belief that the sun was a running Cosmic Sun-Reindeer. The people in the paintings were the shamans, who had a contact with the spirit world through trance with their drumming and songs. [[Shamanism]] is the oldest cultural tradition of [[Finland]] and the North.&lt;ref name=lahelma /&gt; It has been actively present already in the [[Paleolithic age]].

The [[elk]] has traditionally been a very important prey for the people of the north. The elk has also meant the Center of the Universe. Some of the eighteen elk of Astuvansalmi have dots on their heart. All except one is looking west. Some are moving and some are standing.

The boat was an important means of transport in the lake regions of prehistoric Finland. Big boats of skin and wood were already being made before the Vikings started making their big ships. The boats were quite similar to the North American Indian models.

[[Image:Astuvansalmi tellervo.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A woman figure with a [[Bow (weapon)|bow]] – the [[Tellervo]] of Astuva – a rarity among the rock paintings.]]
The human figures are both shamans and spirits, who are connected with hunting ceremonies. The human figures could also have meant the people who drew them. The rare woman figure holding a bow in her hand is thought to show the mythic "[[Tellervo]]", a goddess from the [[Kalevala]] mythology, who is thought to be the progenitor of the human race. Women never usually took part in the hunting, that is why she is thought to be of a more divine nature.&lt;ref name=lahelma /&gt;

The '''Authors' Club''' is a British [[gentlemen's club|membership organisation]] established as a place where writers could meet and talk. It was founded by the novelist and critic [[Walter Besant]] in 1891. It is headquartered at the [[National Liberal Club]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.igs.ie/events/detail/irish-architectural-and-decorative-studies-volume-xvi-igs-journal-launch "Irish Architectural and Decorative Studies Vol. XVI - Journal Launch"], Irish Georgian Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Authors' Club was based for many years next door to its present site, on [[Whitehall Court]], first moving into the National Liberal Club in 1966. After ten years there, in 1976 the Authors' Club joined forces with [[The Arts Club]] in [[Dover Street]], London W1. In 2011 it moved to Blacks, a Grade 2* listed building by John Meard in [[Dean Street]], [[Soho]] - a house that was once home to a club run by [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[Thomas Gainsborough]] - where it remained for three years. It has now returned to its old home in the National Liberal Club. The Club welcomes both men and women as members, and is open to all those 'professionally engaged with literature'.

It was at a dinner at the Authors’ Club that [[Oscar Wilde]] denounced the censorship of his play ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]''. 'Casting aside all his gifts of humour and irony the angry Irish poet poured out his sense of assault and battery committed upon himself and laid his spirit bare and bruised before us. Having finished he did not sit down again but swept from the company still overwhelmed by the weight of his wrongs.'&lt;ref&gt;Phillpotts, Eden, ''From the angle of 88'', Hutchinson [1951]&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Poets Laureate — [[Alfred Austin]], [[John Masefield]] and [[John Betjeman]] — have graced its ranks, while guest speakers included [[Émile Zola]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Bram Stoker]], [[TS Eliot]] and [[Clement Attlee]]. [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] was for many years chairman, and often used to read his manuscripts to members prior to publication.

The first president of the Authors' Club was the novelist  [[George Meredith]];&lt;ref&gt;List of Members, Authors' Club, London 1909&lt;/ref&gt; he was followed by [[Thomas Hardy]];&lt;ref&gt;List of Members, Authors' Club, London 1910&lt;/ref&gt; who was in turn succeeded  by [[JM Barrie]].&lt;ref&gt;List of Members, Authors' Club, London 1928&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent presidents included the architectural historian Sir [[Banister Fletcher]], the Anglo-Irish writer, dramatist and poet [[Lord Dunsany]], [[Compton Mackenzie]] – author of ''[[Whisky Galore (novel)|Whisky Galore]]'' – and [[Laurence Meynell]]. The current president is the author and ''[[The Independent]]'' columnist John Walsh.

== Awards ==
The Club holds literary lunches and dinners. It hosts three literary awards each year: the [[Authors' Club First Novel Award]], the  [[Dolman Best Travel Book Award]], and the Banister Fletcher Award for the best book on art or architecture.

[[Image:Benjamin Franklin Parkway-27527.JPG|thumb|260px|right|Benjamin Franklin Parkway, from the top of the steps of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].]]
'''Benjamin Franklin Parkway''', commonly abbreviated to '''Ben Franklin Parkway''', is a scenic boulevard that runs through the cultural heart of [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Named for Founding Father [[Benjamin Franklin]], the mile-long Parkway cuts diagonally across the [[grid plan]] pattern of Center City's Northwest quadrant. It starts at [[Philadelphia City Hall]], curves around [[Logan Circle (Philadelphia)|Logan Circle]], and ends before the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].

==Attractions==
The Parkway is the spine of Philadelphia's [[Museum District, Philadelphia|Museum District]]. Some of the city's most famous sights are here: [[Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul (Philadelphia)|Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul]]; [[Swann Memorial Fountain]]; [[Parkway Central Library]], the [[Family Court Building]], the [[Franklin Institute]], [[Moore College of Art and Design]], the [[Academy of Natural Sciences]], the [[Rodin Museum]], [[Eakins Oval]], the [[Barnes Foundation]] and the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. From its northern end, the Parkway provides access to [[Fairmount Park]] through Kelly Drive (formerly East River Drive), Martin Luther King Drive (formerly West River Drive), the [[Schuylkill River Trail]], and the [[Schuylkill Expressway]] ([[Interstate 76 (east)|I-76]]).

The Parkway also is an outdoor sculpture garden. Works include: ''The Thinker'' by [[Auguste Rodin]]; ''Gates of Hell'' also by Rodin; ''LOVE'' by [[Robert Indiana]]; ''The Ideal Scout'' by [[Robert Tait McKenzie]]; ''Three-Way Piece'' by [[Henry Moore]]; the three River figures in the [[Swann Memorial Fountain]] by [[Alexander Stirling Calder]]; ''Shakespeare Memorial'' also by Calder; ''Philadelphia Holocaust Memorial'' by [[Nathan Rapoport]]; ''Joseph Leidy'' by [[Samuel Murray]]; ''[[Aero Memorial (Manship)|Aero Memorial]]'' by [[Paul Manship]]; ''General Galusha Pennypacker'' by [[Charles Grafly]] and [[Albert Laessle]]; ''Jesus Breaking Bread'' by [[Walter Erlebacher]], ''All Wars Colored Soldiers and Sailors Memorial'' by [[J. Otto Schweizer]]; ''Thaddeus Kosciuszko'' by [[Robert Ingersoll Aitken|Robert Aitken]]; ''Civil War Soldiers and Sailors Memorial'' by [[Hermon Atkins MacNeil]]; ''Kopernik'' by [[Dudley Talcott|Dudley Vaill Talcott]]; ''Joan of Arc'' by [[Emmanuel Fremiet]]; [[Washington Monument (Philadelphia)|Washington Monument]] by [[Rudolf Siemering]]; and the ''Rocky'' statue by [[A. Thomas Schomberg]].

==Urban renewal==
[[File:Philadelphia museum district.JPG|thumb|left|Benjamin Franklin Parkway, with [[Franklin Institute]] in the foreground.]]

In a city [[list of Philadelphia neighborhoods|famous for its urban planning]], the Parkway represents one of the earliest examples of urban renewal in the [[United States]]. The road was constructed to ease heavy industrial congestion in [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]] and to restore Philadelphia's natural and artistic beauty, as part of the [[City Beautiful]] movement.

Preliminary proposals for the Parkway had been produced and added to the City Plan by 1906, but the first comprehensive plan for the Parkway was commissioned in 1907 by the Fairmount Park Art Association (now the [[Association for Public Art]]). The Association commissioned architects [[Horace Trumbauer]], Clarence Zantzinger, and [[Paul Philippe Cret]], who created a detailed parkway design that was formally added to the City Plan in 1909. Construction on the Parkway did not begin until 1917, when French landscape architect [[Jacques Gréber]] submitted a revised plan to the Commissioners of Fairmount Park. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brownlee|first=David Bruce |title=Building the city beautiful: the Benjamin Franklin Parkway and the Philadelphia Museum of Art|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press| location = Philadelphia, PA | year = 1989 | isbn = 0812282213|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gréber designed the Parkway in 1917 to emulate the [[Champs-Élysées]] in [[Paris]], [[France]]. The route was determined by an axis drawn from [[Philadelphia City Hall|City Hall Tower]] to a fixed point on the hill that [[William Penn]] called [[Fairmount Water Works|"Fairmount"]], now the site of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phila.gov/phils/NationalHistoryDayPhilly/OneHistoryDay_2007.htm Outline History of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway 1871-1935.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Champs-Élysées terminates at the [[Arc de Triomphe]], and the Parkway's terminating at the Art Museum gives the notion of "a slice of Paris in Philadelphia." The Parkway also has an international flavor by being lined with flags of countries from around the world. 

The traffic [[Roundabout|rotary]] on the western end of the Parkway, at the foot of the Art Museum's [[Rocky Steps]], is named [[Eakins Oval]] after Philadelphia painter [[Thomas Eakins]]. The traffic lanes around Eakins Oval originally formed a regular oval; this pattern was modified in the early 1960s to its present elongated circular shape, with the truncated lanes serving as staging areas for various events.

Because of its central location, the Parkway is the site for many concerts and parades. On July 2, 2005, the steps of the museum played host to the Philadelphia venue of [[Live 8]], where artists such as [[Dave Matthews Band]], [[Linkin Park]] and [[Maroon 5]] performed. The Parkway was also the site of Jay-Z's [[Budweiser Made in America Festival|Made in America Festival]] on September 1-2, 2012 featuring [[Jay-Z]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Skrillex]] and [[Calvin Harris]], among others.  On September 26th and 27th, 2015, Pope Francis visited Philadelphia and the Parkway was flooded with over a million visitors both weekend days, a Celebration of Families on Saturday, and a Holy Mass on Sunday.

In recent years, there has been concern that the original plan of a wide, multi-sectioned, multi-laned, tree-lined boulevard, while beautiful to travel on, is not very engaging for pedestrian or other public use. Traffic along the Parkway has decreased considerably because of the completion of [[Interstate 676]] (Vine Street Expressway), linking the Schuylkill Expressway with the [[Benjamin Franklin Bridge]]. In response, the roadway has been narrowed somewhat and the sidewalks expanded around [[Logan Circle (Philadelphia)|Logan Circle]]. Various plans for the rest of the Parkway, some of which would insert shops and other smaller structures into the long stretches between museums, have been proposed, but none so far have been thought feasible or financially sound.

A new museum for the [[Barnes Foundation]] collection of [[Impressionist]] art on the site between the [[Free Library of Philadelphia|Free Library]] and the [[Rodin Museum]] opened in Spring 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21478">A '''book club''' is a group of people who meet to discuss a book or books that they have [[reading (activity)|read]] and express their opinions, likes, dislikes, etc. It is more often called simply a '''book club''', a term that is also used to describe a [[book sales club]], which can cause confusion. Other frequently used terms to describe a book discussion club include '''reading group''', '''book group''', and '''book discussion group'''. Book discussion clubs may meet in private homes, [[library|libraries]], [[bookstore]]s, online forums, pubs, and in cafés or restaurants over meals or drinks.

A practice also associated with book discussion, '''common reading program''' or '''common read''', involves institutions encouraging their members to discuss select books in group settings; common reading programs are largely associated with educational institutions encouraging their students to hold book discussion meetings.

== Single-title clubs ==
A single-title club is one in which people discuss a particular title that every person in the group has read at the same time, often with each member buying a personal copy. Clearly, the club must somehow decide ahead of time what that title will be. Some groups may decide to choose new release titles, whilst others may choose older ones, or a mixture of the two. If it is a book discussion club that meets at a library, then each member may borrow a copy of the book from the library over a given timeframe in order for a later discussion.

There may be a few problems with these clubs. Some members may regard them as opportunities to meet people for social contact and general conversation, partially veering off onto a wide variety of non-literary topics, while others wish to engage in serious literary analysis focused on the book in question and related works, with little non-literary interaction. Additionally, some members may suggest a book not because they are interested in it from a literary point-of-view but because they think it will offer them an opportunity to make points of personal interest to them or fit an external agenda. Also, different expectations and education/skill levels may lead to conflicts and disappointments in clubs of this kind.

== Multi-title clubs ==
The characteristics of a multi-title club are such that each member may be reading different titles from each other at any given time, and they may share a reading list for a period of time. What distinguishes this from any group of unrelated people reading different things from each other is that each title is expected to be read by the next member in a serial fashion.

=== Open loans ===
Open loans suggest that the books in question are free to be loaned among the population with the expectation of getting them back eventually. Instead of one member deciding what everyone will read, with all the cost implications of acquiring that title, these clubs usually involve circulating books they already own. Each book is introduced with a short precis. This offers members the advantage of previewing a work before committing to read. It has the effect of narrowing the focus of the dialogue so that book and reader are more quickly and more accurately matched up. The sequential nature of the process implies that within a short time, three to five people may have read the same title, which is the perfect amount for a worthy conversation.

=== Catch and release ===
Catch and release imply that actual ownership of the book transfers each iteration with no expectation of the book returning to the original owner. The mechanism of transfer may include a personal face to face hand off, sending the items through the mail, or most remarkably, leaving the book in a public place with the expectation that unknown future readers will find it there. All three methods are utilized with [[BookCrossing]]. Participants use a website and a system of unique identification numbers to track released items as they migrate through a worldwide community. The interaction is largely web-centric, but it does not exclude face-to-face gatherings, each of which can take on the traits of other book discussion clubs.

==Library book clubs==
Many [[public library|public libraries]] lead book clubs as a library program on a regular basis.  A librarian usually leads a discussion after participants read the book.  Copies of the book are available to either be checked out or signed out for the group meeting.  If leading a book discussion group outside of the facility,  often libraries offer book discussion kits where several titles of a book are able to be loaned out of the library to a single patron.  Also, the lending period is typically longer than for the average book.  The kits also contains a suggested reading guide with discussion questions.  This is a convenience as everyone in the group is not forced to buy a copy of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Hermes, V., Hill, M.A., &amp; Frisbee, J. L. (2008). Reviving literary discussion: Book club to go kits. ''Reference &amp; User Services Quarterly, 48''(1), 30-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Librarians also aid in the procurement of items needed for private book club meetings. They are able to withhold multiple copies of a publication and extend loan periods. They are also able to facilitate club meetings digitally, through discussion boards or video meetings. Many librarians note the positive influence of [[Google+]] hangouts and [[Skype]] to host meetings for long distance club members and for times in which all members could not attend the club. Librarians have helped non-traditional book clubs find footing within their community.&lt;ref&gt;Gilliss, A. F. (2014). A novel idea: librarians reimagine book clubs with the help of technology. American Libraries, (5). 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online clubs ==
With the challenge that not all members of a club can regularly meet at an appointed place and time, a new form of book clubs has emerged online. Online clubs exist in the shape of [[Internet forum]]s, [[Yahoo Groups]], e-mail [[mailing list]]s, dedicated websites, such as Goodreads.com,&lt;ref&gt;Goodreads. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.goodreads.com/group&lt;/ref&gt; apps such as [http://novellic.com Novellic] and even telephone conference calls. Also, in the category of [[social networks]], these online clubs are made up of members of a variety of reading interests and often approach book discussion in different ways, e.g. academic discussion, pleasure-reading discussion, personal connection, and reaction to books members read.

== Author led clubs ==
In 2012, a new book club format referred to as author-led book clubs was introduced by Business Book Club "[http://www.12booksgroup.com 12 Books]." Author led book clubs include the author of the current book as part of the discussion; it often concludes the discussion with a live [[conference call]] or [[webinar]].

== Broadcast clubs ==
A broadcast club is one in which a television, radio, or podcast show features a regular segment that presents a discussion of a book. The segment is announced in advance so that viewers or listeners may read the book prior to the broadcast discussion. Some notable broadcast book discussion clubs include:

* "[[Oprah's Book Club]]", a segment of the American television show ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' hosted by [[Oprah Winfrey]]
* "[[Book Club of the Air]]", a segment of [[National Public Radio|NPR]]'s American radio show ''[[Talk of the Nation]]'' hosted by [[Ray Suarez]]
* "Good Morning America Book Club", a segment of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s American television show ''[[Good Morning America]]''
* "Despierta Leyendo (Wake Up Reading)", a segment of [[Univision]]'s American Spanish-language television show ''[[¡Despierta América!]] (Wake Up America)'' hosted by [[Jorge Ramos (news anchor)|Jorge Ramos]]
* "[[Richard &amp; Judy#Richard .26 Judy Book Club|Richard &amp; Judy Book Club]]", a segment of [[Channel 4]]'s British television show ''[[Richard &amp; Judy]]'' hosted by [[Richard and Judy|Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan]]
* ''[[Bookclub (radio)|Bookclub]]'', a British radio show on the [[BBC Radio 4]] station hosted by [[James Naughtie]]
* ''[[First Tuesday Book Club]]'', an Australian television show on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] network hosted by [[Jennifer Byrne]]
* "Jonny's Book Club", a segment of the weekly [[podcast]] ''[[Gay Pimpin' with Jonny McGovern]]'' hosted by [[Jonny McGovern]]

== Book reading clubs ==
Given the busy lifestyles of today, another variation on the traditional 'book club' is the book reading club. In such a club, the group agrees on a specific book, and each week (or whatever frequency), one person in the group [[Reading (process)#History|reads the book out loud]] while the rest of the group listens. The group can either allow interruptions for comments and questions from the members at any time, or agree to allow such input at chapter or section endings. Such a club makes reading a shared experience and frees the busy members from the "homework" of having read the book before coming to the club. It also creates a lively environment for commenting on the specifics of the books as it is read and can lead to very enriching exchanges. A given book may continue for several sittings, depending on the pace of reading, frequency of meetings, and the extent of comments and discussion. Members can take turns reading to share the reading responsibility. Another variation on the concept could be jointly listening to an audio-book with pauses for comments. Once a book is completed, members recommend their choices of the new books and vote on which book to proceed with next.

[[File:Palmes Otley.jpg|thumbnail|Brass rubbing of a memorial showing the alliance of the Lindley and Palmes family, [[Otley]] Church, West Yorkshire]]
[[File:Roger and Agnes Thornton Brass.jpg|thumb|upright|Rubbing of the Thorntons' brass, [[Newcastle Cathedral]] ([[Newcastle upon Tyne]])]]

'''Brass rubbing''' was originally a largely [[Great Britain|British]] enthusiasm for reproducing onto paper [[monumental brass]]es – commemorative [[brass]] plaques found in churches, usually originally on the floor, from between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries. The concept of recording textures of things is more generally called [[rubbing|making a rubbing]]. What distinguishes rubbings from [[frottage (art)|frottage]] is that rubbings are meant to reproduce the form of something being transferred, whereas frottage is usually only intended to use a general texture.

Brass rubbings are created by laying a sheet of paper on top of a brass (actually called "[[latten]]" - an alloy of brass and nickel) and rubbing the paper with [[graphite]], [[wax]], or [[chalk]], a process similar to rubbing a pencil over a piece of paper placed on top of a coin.  In the "old days" rubbings were most commonly made using the equivalent of what nowadays is called "[[Butcher paper|butcher's paper]]" [a {{convert|22|-|30|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} roll of whitish paper] laid down over the brass and rubbed with "heelball", a waxy glob of black crayon once used to shine shoes. Now most brass rubbers purchase special paper rolls of heavy duty black velvety material, and the crayons are gold, silver or bronze (other colours are available).

Brass plaques are slowly but surely worn away by the rubbing process and in many cases creating rubbings is banned.  Brass rubbing centres with replicas of original brass plaques have become a prime source for brass rubbings in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stmartin-in-the-fields.org/visit/things-to-see-and-do/|title=Things to see and do - St Martin-in-the-Fields|work=St Martin-in-the-Fields|access-date=2018-02-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Replicas are often not the same scale as the original.

Past speakers include [[Marcel Wanders]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Raman Hui]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Tom Dixon (industrial designer)]], [[Jimmy Choo]], [[John William Sorrell|Sir John Sorrell]], [[Karim Rashid]], [[Bingham Willis]], [[Marc Newson]], and [[Vivienne Tam]].

Each year, BODW forms a partnership with a different country. The country is invited to bring a group of designers to Hong Kong to give presentations at the conference. The country can also hold exhibitions and seminars about its national design. The partner country for 2008 was the [[Netherlands]] and for 2006 and 2007 was the [[UK]] and [[Italy]] respectively.

BODW has main events which occur each year including the BODW Forum where designers give presentations. There is also the HKDC Award Gala Dinner where the [[HKDC Awards]] are presented. These awards include the Design for Asia Awards, the World’s Outstanding Chinese Designer Award, the Design Leadership Award, the Design for Asia Award, and the Hong Kong Young Design Talent Awards.

==General==
The Eight Views (or Vistas) of Danyang are the selected natural scenes of [[Danyang County]], [[Chungcheongbuk-do]] in [[Korea]].  They are mainly famous rocks and peaks of this mountainous region.
* Dodam Sambong (3 Peak Island - [[Hangeul]]: 도담삼봉, [[Hanja]]: 島潭三峰)
* Seokmun (Stone Gate - Hangeul:석문, Hanja:石門)
* Gudambong (Hanja:亀潭峰)
* Oksunbong (Hanja:玉筍峰)
* Sangseonam (Hanja:上仙岩)
* Jungseonam (Hanja:中仙岩)
* Haseonam (Hanja:下仙岩)
* Sainam (Hanja:舎人岩)

Among these sights the best known is Dodam Sambong (3 Peak Island), representing the typical love triangle of ancient Korea: a husband, his wife and his mistress. The biggest peak, about 20 feet high with a pavilion on top, in the middle represents the husband, while the first smaller peak on one side of the husband is the wife. On the other side the smallest peak is the mistress. According to legend, the wife was not able to give birth to a son, so the husband found a mistress to produce a son. The wife was upset, which is why the wife peak is farther from the husband than the mistress.  If you look at the wife from a specific angle and use a bit of imagination, you will see that the wife was so angry that she turned away from the husband.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lifeinkorea.com/Travel2/88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.korea.net/news/news/newsView.asp?serial_no=20080619007&lt;/ref&gt;

Danyang County is in the area of the [[Namhan River]], upstream south of the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] where [[Seoul]] is located.  It is said to be in the middle of the route on which the Chinese culture in ancient days reached the southern area of Korean and ultimately Japan. &lt;ref&gt;[http://akatonbo-jo.cocolog-nifty.com/jo/2008/04/5_ebaa.html Traveling in the Eight Views of Danyang Area] (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7103">'''Fixed verse''' forms are a kind of [[wikt:template|template]] or [[formula]] that [[poetry]] can be composed in. The opposite of Fixed verse is [[Free verse]] poetry, which by design has little or no pre-established guidelines.

The various [[poetic form]]s, such as meter, [[rhyme scheme]], and [[stanzas]] guide and limit a poet's choices when composing poetry. A fixed verse form combines one or more of these limitations into a larger form.

A form usually demands strict adherence to the established guidelines that to some poets may seem stifling, while other poets view the  rigid structure as a challenge to be innovative and creative while staying within the guidelines.

== Examples of Fixed Verse forms ==

{{Dynamic list}}
; [[Haiku]] : A Japanese form designed to be small and concise by limiting the number of lines and the number of syllables in a line. Japanese haiku are three-line poems with the first and the third line having five syllables and the middle having seven syllables. [[Haiku in English|English-language Haiku]] may be shorter than seventeen syllables, though some poets prefer to keep to the 5-7-5 format.
::Whitecaps on the bay:
::A broken signboard banging
::In the April wind.
::—[[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] (collected in ''Haiku: This Other World'', Arcade Publishing, 1998)

; [[Limerick (poetry)|Limerick]] : The limerick is an English form, usually humorous and often obscene.  It consists of five lines with an AABBA rhyme scheme, the third and fourth lines shorter than the other three.
::There was an Old Man with a beard,
::Who said, 'It is just as I feared!
::Two Owls and a Hen,
::Four Larks and a Wren,
::Have all built their nests in my beard!'

::—[[Edward Lear]]

; [[Sonnet]] : The sonnet is a European form and at its most basic requires that the total length be fourteen lines. There are two primary forms of the sonnet:
*; [[Sonnet#In English|English Sonnet]]
*: In addition to above requirements, the English Sonnet must be four stanzas, the first three being [[quatrains]] and the last a [[couplet]]. Also the rhyme scheme for the quatrains is A-B-A-B and the final couplet is rhyming.
:::Let me not to the marriage of true minds
:::Admit impediments, love is not love
:::Which alters when it alteration finds,
:::Or bends with the remover to remove.

:::O no, it is an ever fixed mark
:::That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
:::It is the star to every wand'ring bark,
:::Whose worth's unknown although his height be taken.

:::Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
:::Within his bending sickle's compass come,
:::Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
:::But bears it out even to the edge of doom:

:::If this be error and upon me proved,
:::I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

:::—[[William Shakespeare]], ''Sonnet 116''

*; [[Sonnet#Petrarchan_sonnet|Italian Sonnet]] : The Italian sonnet requires that the fourteen lines be broken into one [[octave (poetry)|octave]] (two [[quatrain]]s), which describe a problem, followed by a [[sestet]] (two [[tercet]]s), which gives the resolution to it.
:::Methought I saw my late espoused Saint
:::Brought to me like Alcestis from the grave,
:::Whom Joves great Son to her glad Husband gave,
:::Rescu'd from death by force though pale and faint.
:::Mine as whom washt from spot of child-bed taint,
:::Purification in the old Law did save,
:::And such, as yet once more I trust to have
:::Full sight of her in Heaven without restraint,

:::Came vested all in white, pure as her mind:
:::Her face was vail'd, yet to my fancied sight,
:::Love, sweetness, goodness, in her person shin'd
:::So clear, as in no face with more delight.
:::But O as to embrace me she enclin'd
:::I wak'd, she fled, and day brought back my night.

:::—[[John Milton]], ''Sonnet XXIII''

; [[Sestina]] : The sestina has a highly structured form consisting of six stanzas of six lines each, followed by a [[tercet]] (called its [[envoi]] or tornada) for a total of thirty-nine lines. The same set of six words ends the lines of each of the six-line stanzas, but in a different order each time.

::September rain falls on the house.
::In the failing light, the old grandmother
::sits in the kitchen with the child
::beside the Little Marvel Stove,
::reading the jokes from the almanac,
::laughing and talking to hide her tears.

::She thinks that her equinoctial tears
::and the rain that beats on the roof of the house
::were both foretold by the almanac,
::but only known to a grandmother.
::The iron kettle sings on the stove.
::She cuts some bread and says to the child,

::It's time for tea now; but the child
::is watching the teakettle's small hard tears
::dance like mad on the hot black stove,
::the way the rain must dance on the house.
::Tidying up, the old grandmother
::hangs up the clever almanac

::on its string. Birdlike, the almanac
::hovers half open above the child,
::hovers above the old grandmother
::and her teacup full of dark brown tears.
::She shivers and says she thinks the house
::feels chilly, and puts more wood in the stove.

::It was to be, says the Marvel Stove.
::I know what I know, says the almanac.
::With crayons the child draws a rigid house 
::and a winding pathway. Then the child 
::puts in a man with buttons like tears 
::and shows it proudly to the grandmother.

::But secretly, while the grandmother
::busies herself about the stove,
::the little moons fall down like tears
::from between the pages of the almanac
::into the flower bed the child
::has carefully placed in the front of the house.

::Time to plant tears, says the almanac.
::The grandmother sings to the marvelous stove
::and the child draws another inscrutable house.

::—[[Elizabeth Bishop]]

; [[Villanelle]] : A villanelle has only two [[rhyme]] sounds. The first and third lines of the first [[stanza]] are rhyming [[refrain]]s that alternate as the third line in each successive stanza and form a [[couplet]] at the close. A villanelle is nineteen lines long, consisting of five [[tercet]]s and one concluding [[quatrain]].

::Do not go gentle into that good night,
::Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
::Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

::Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
::Because their words had forked no lightning they
::Do not go gentle into that good night.

::Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
::Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
::Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

::Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
::And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
::Do not go gentle into that good night.

::Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
::Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, 
::Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

::And you, my father, there on the sad height,
::Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
::Do not go gentle into that good night.
::Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

::—[[Dylan Thomas]], ''Do not Go Gentle into That Good Night''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13421">[[File:Flying Lesbians band logo.jpg|thumb|right|The band's logo, also used as the cover of their album]]
The '''Flying Lesbians''' were a [[All-female band|seven-woman]] German music group  which existed from 1974 to 1977 and released an eponymous album in 1975. The album - as indie music production - ran very well, with ca 17.000 LP's sold.&lt;ref name="routledge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kramarae|first1=Cheris|last2=Spender|first2=Dale|title=Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge|date=2004|isbn=9781135963156|page=1209|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QAOUAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT1269&amp;dq=%22flying%20lesbians%22&amp;pg=PT1269#v=onepage&amp;q=%22flying%20lesbians%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 June 2016|chapter=Lesbian Popular Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flying Lesbians s/t LP|url=https://continuo.wordpress.com/2011/06/23/flying-lesbians-st-lp/|publisher=Continuo|date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="qmh"&gt;{{cite web|title=German Lesbian Bands:  Flying Lesbians, Lysistrara, Witch Is Witch + solo artist Carolina Brauckmann|url=http://queermusicheritage.com/mar2012flying.html|publisher=Queer Music Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;cf. Flying Lesbians in German Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Flying Lesbians'' functioned as a [[co-operative]], wrote the lyrics in German and English, and composed all songs by themselves. For copyright purposes they worked under the joint pseudonym of "[[Emily Pankhurst]]".

Their logo was a [[labrys]], a double-headed axe. Their website explains that this is an ancient symbol of women's power throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="logo"&gt;{{cite web|title=(Text seen when hovering over logo)|url=http://www.flying-lesbians.de/|publisher=Flying Lesbians|accessdate=15 June 2016 | quote=die doppelaxt, das zeichen des matriarchalischen weltmacht...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They first performed, to an audience of 2,000, at the first German women's festival in [[Berlin]] in 1974:&lt;ref&gt;cf. German Wikipedia, Chapter: Public appearances [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frauenzentrum_Westberlin?veaction=edit&amp;section=7]; Andrei S. Markovits and Philip S. Gorski: The New Women’s Movement, in: Michael G. Huelshoff, Andrei S. Markovits, Simon Reich (Eds.): From Bundesrepublik to Deutschland: German Politics After Unification, Michigan 1993, p.140; Birgit Bosold, Dorothee Brill, Detlev Weitz (Eds. on behalf of the [[Stiftung Deutsches Historisches Museum|German Historical Museum]] and The Schwules Museum): Homosexualität_en, Catalogue (German Edition) to the eponymous exhibition, Berlin 2015, p.150.&lt;/ref&gt;

"On May 11, 1974, the Berlin Women's Center organized the first public women's festival in West Germany. The ''Rockfete im Rock'' (Rock Party in a Skirt, in German, the word ''Rock'' also means ''skirt'') was a politically significant event at the time, and men were not admitted. A popular UK band cancelled its performance, and a newcomer band played in its place: The ''Flying Lesbians'' had formed a few days earlier and consisted of seven women from the amateur music scene. Their performance was a hit. 
The Flying Lesbians produced an LP and toured West Germany and Europe in the years that followed. They rocked fiercely through the summer of 1974 - for women only - including a show at the legendary women's camp on the Danish Island of [[Femø]]. The band became a [[role model]] for several other women bands, including ''Lysistrara'', ''UnterRock'', ''Schneewittchen'', ''Les-Be-Ton'', and ''Ausserhalb''."&lt;ref&gt;Birgit Bosold, Dorothée Brill, Detlev Weitz (Eds.): Homosexualiy_ies. English Booklet to the eponymous exhibition of the Deutsches Historisches Museum (German Historical Museum) and Schwules Museum*, Berlin 2015, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

This 1974 international women's camp on the [[Denmark|Danish]] island of [[Femø]] - with participants from Europe and the USA, including [[Diana E.H. Russell]] - and the adjoining, big open air women's festival in the Danish Capital [[Copenhagen]] were a milestone for the European women's movement. It was here that the impetus and concepts were created for the first "[[International Tribunal on Crimes against Women]]" following the "[[International Women's Year]]" in [[Bruxelles]], [[Belgium]] in 1976. The ''Flying Lesbians'' actively engaged and played in both events, in [[Copenhagen]] they played in front of 30,000 festival visitors - this only three months after their founding as a band in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;For Femø pictures, documents and videos cf. [http://feministberlin.de/category/kultur/frauencamp-femo/] and [http://flying-lesbians.de/category/frauenfeste/femo-1974/]; for the first International Tribunal on Crimes against Women in Brussels 1976 cf. the documentation by [[Diana E.H. Russell]][http://feministberlin.de/wp-content/uploads/gewalt/Crimes_Against_Women_Tribunal.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the International Tribunal in Brussels in March 1976, the ''Flying Lesbians'' performed twice. [[Diana E.H. Russell]] describes the special social function and atmospheric effects of their music for the Tribunal:

"For many women the most enjoyable events of the Tribunal were two parties on Saturday and Sunday nights. Some coordinating committee members felt that it was important to have some good social times together, and so we had invited The Flying Lesbians, an extremely 
popular feminist seven-piece rock band from Germany, to play once or twice during the Tribunal. While they were willing to play for free, as they always do for feminist events, they did need their transport costs. Because of our financial situation, we had delayed too long to rent a large enough hail for a party. So we ended up having two parties over the weekend in the far too small women’s center, Maison des Femmes. Hundreds of women, gay and straight, danced exuberantly to The Flying Lesbians’ music, and the crushed conditions didn’t seem to bother anyone.&lt;br /&gt;In situations where language and cultural differences can so obstruct communication and feelings of solidarity, music, singing, and dance can be much more effective. The Matson [sic; i. e. Maison] des Femmes will never be the same after its first all women dance, and the same is true for some of the partying women."&lt;ref&gt;Russell,Diana E. H., Van de Ven, Nicole (Compilors, Editors): Crimes Against Women: Proceedings of the International Tribunal. Originalausgabe Print: 1976; Kostenlos Online:  RUSSELL PUBLICATIONS, Berkeley, California 94703. USA, 3rd Edition 1990, http://www.dianarussell.com/f/Crimes_Against_Women_Tribunal.pdf, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years from 1974 until 1977 the ''Flying Lesbians'' became the musical "voice of the women's movement". In 1977, Miriam Frank stated in "[[Off Our Backs]]":

“Flying Lesbians is wonderful German, women-made music… The Flying Lesbians are the German women’s movement expressed in music. Each song reflects an important idea, criticism or problem that is being worked out now in the project collectives and women’s centers of [[West Germany]], or that is being argued about in women’s Kneipes (bars) and around communal tables. The record is alive…not only because it is popularly distributed and widely played, but also because it successfully synthesizes ideas and action through music – Rock music…

The blatantly lesbian songs by the Flying Lesbians are surely different from the cozy sweetness of the last few years in [[Women's Music|American Lesbian music]]. They’re refreshingly aggressive and controversial. The first song, ''I’m a Lesbian, How About You'' is a tight boogy woogy, very danceable, with especially nice piano and guitar work. It’s a lot of fun, and then come the two hard ones... The Flying Lesbians really take off with ''Frauen kommt her''. This song, ''Women, come on, let’s get it together, united we are strong'' (transl.) has been sung in the women’s movement for years now, in small groups, at demonstrations, in ever-widening circles, and the [[Rock music|Rock]] setting gives the song a special richness, openness and happiness. It’s the showpiece of the record...”&lt;ref&gt;Miriam Frank, [[Off Our Backs]] magazine, Sept. 1977, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cillie Rentmeister]] in several essays reflects on the Flying Lesbians and the function of women's festivals for the women's movement as "[[Rite of passage]]" and as "[[Debutante|coming out party]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. several essays by [[Cillie Rentmeister]] about the Flying Lesbians and the function of women's festivals, e.g. "Sounds of Women’s Movement", The [[Finland]] Lectures – held at [[Helsinki]], [[Sibelius Academy]] and at [[University of Jyväskylä]], Dept. of Music, Art and Culture Studies, 1985 [http://flying-lesbians.de/category/geschichte-der-flying-lesbians/sounds-of-womens-movement/, full illustrated version]; further on ''feministberlin1968ff'' (historical website on the German women's movement in Berlin, by [[Cristina Perincioli]], English version) with Rentmeisters essay ''1974 - Flying Lesbians, Feminist Festivals, Women's Festivals", shortened English version, with illustrations [http://feministberlin1968ff.de/feminism-at-work/1974-flying-lesbians-feminist-festivals/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Flying Lesbians gave their stage revival in autumn 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coFZDY4IH8o stage Revival 2007 Berlin in Youtube: "Flying Lesbians fliegen noch einmal!" - "The Flying Lesbians fly again!"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Flying Lesbians were also represented at exhibitions such as ''"Homosexualitaet_en"'' (''Homosexualities''), a double exhibition in the [[Schwules Museum|Schwules Museum "Gay Museum"]] and the "[[Stiftung Deutsches Historisches Museum|German Historical Museum]]" in Berlin 2015, - the first representative exhibition in Germany also in relation to the prominent official locations as well as the comprehensive claim and content: "Covering a total area of 1600 square meters, ''“Homosexuality_ies”'' documents 150 years of the history, politics and culture of homosexual women and men in Germany..."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dhm.de/en/ausstellungen/archive/2015/homosexuality-ies.html] Flying Lesbians see Catalogue Page 150f.

'''Gifted art''' (or '''free art''') is any form or piece of art that is given freely, whether to a city, a group of people, a community or an individual. It refers to any [[art]] that is distributed at no direct cost. It is a form of [[conceptual art]]. It comes from a belief that art should be available for all people to enjoy, whether rich or poor, university graduate or junior high dropout. Since Gifted Art is an expressive form of art - an idea, it encompasses virtually all forms of art: [[movie]]s, [[literature]], [[music record]]ings, [[sculpture]],&lt;ref&gt;https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6DF103AF935A25751C1A96F948260&lt;/ref&gt; [[painting]],&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/arts_and_culture/7730285.stm&lt;/ref&gt; [[graffiti]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.france24.com/france24Public/en/archives/news/culture/20070512-swoon-street-art-moma-urban-new-york-paris-l-j-beaubourg.php&lt;/ref&gt; [[digital art]], [[street performance]]s, [[performance art]], [[sticker art]], [[comic]]s, coffeehouse poetry and [[Internet art|Internet]]-distributed art etc.

== Short History ==
Gifted Art has a long history in the arts. Many artists have been known to give art freely to each other, in an effort to pass along ideas, etc. [[Picasso]] and many of his contemporaries were fond of this.
[[Duchamp]] was one of the first modern day artists to Gift to the public with his piece, ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', for an art show in 1917. He gave the piece under the name of "R. Mutt," presumably to hide his identity as the artist. He actually had to pay $7 to have the piece exhibited in the show, and never intended on making any money from it. He gave it freely for all to see and to push forward the [[Dada]] movement.
In the 50's, [[Ray Johnson]] started doing [[Mail art]]. He spread the idea to many other artists&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thegalleriesatmoore.org/publications/johnsoncp.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; and it still occurs today. In 2002, a 6&amp;nbsp;ft X 53&amp;nbsp;ft mural by [[Roy Lichtenstein]] was installed in the Times Square Subway Station in New York City. It was gifted by the artist to all New Yorkers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artfacts.net/index.php/pageType/exhibitionInfo/exhibition/36702/lang/1&lt;/ref&gt;
In recent years, Gifted Art has primarily been embraced by graffiti and urban artists. Many graffiti artists consider the work they do to be art for the public. Banksy writes in his books that he believes art is more important and more enjoyable when it is out on the street where people can view it in their everyday lives than when it hangs in a museum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9930">"'''Information wants to be free'''" is an expression that means that people should be able to access information freely. It is often used by technology activists to criticize laws that limit transparency and general access to information. People who criticize [[Intellectual property#Criticisms|Intellectual Property]] law say the system of such government granted monopolies conflicts with the development of a public domain of information. The expression is often credited to [[Stewart Brand]], who was recorded saying it at a hackers conference in 1984.&lt;ref name="R. Polk Wagner"&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.law.upenn.edu/fac/pwagner/wagner.control.pdf | title = Information wants to be free: intellectual property and the mythologies of control| first = R Polk | last = Wagner | publisher = University of Pennsylvania | format = [[PDF]] essay}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The iconic phrase is attributed to [[Stewart Brand]],&lt;ref name="R. Polk Wagner"/&gt; who, in the late 1960s, founded the [[Whole Earth Catalog]] and argued that technology could be liberating rather than oppressing.&lt;ref name="Ronald J. Baker"&gt;{{citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O5E_k2u7enkC&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=information%20wants%20to%20be%20free&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q=information%20wants%20to%20be%20free&amp;f=false | title = Mind over matter: why intellectual capital is the chief source of wealth | first = Ronald J | last = Baker | page = 80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded occurrence of the expression was at the first [[The Hackers Conference|Hackers Conference]] in 1984. Brand told [[Steve Wozniak]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge338.html | title = Edge 338 | journal = Edge | number = 338 | accessdate = 2011-04-23}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |On the one hand information wants to be expensive, because it's so valuable.  The right information in the right place just changes your life.  On the other hand, information wants to be free, because the cost of getting it out is getting lower and lower all the time.  So you have these two fighting against each other.&lt;ref name = "clarke"&gt;{{citation | first = Roger | last = Clarke | title = Information Wants to be Free | url = http://www.rogerclarke.com/II/IWtbF.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Brand's conference remarks are transcribed in the ''[[Whole Earth Review]]'' (May 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;49) and a later form appears in his ''The Media Lab: Inventing the Future at MIT'':&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | authorlink = Stewart Brand | first = Stewart | last = Brand | title = The Media Lab: Inventing the Future at MIT | publisher = Viking Penguin | year = 1987 | ISBN = 0-14-009701-5 | page = 202}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |Information Wants To Be Free.  Information also wants to be expensive.  ...That tension will not go away.&lt;ref name="clarke"/&gt;}}

According to historian Adrian Johns, the slogan expresses a view that had already been articulated in the mid-20th century by [[Norbert Wiener]], [[Michael Polanyi]] and [[Arnold Plant]], who advocated for the free communication of scientific knowledge, and specifically criticized the [[patent]] system. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Johns | first = Adrian | title = Piracy. The Intellectual Property Wars from Gutenberg to Gates | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | year = 2009 | ISBN = 978-0-226-40118-8 | page = 429 | quote = We still live amid the legacies of these mid-century debates about science and society. We inherit their terms, and the culture of science that shapes our world is the one left to us by them. If we think ‘information wants to be free,’ then we voice a sentiment championed by Wiener, Polanyi and Plant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Gratis'' versus ''Libre''==
{{Main|Gratis versus Libre}}
The various forms of the original statement are ambiguous: the slogan can be used to argue the benefits of propertied information, of liberated, free, and open information, or of both. It can be taken amorally as an expression of a fact of information-science: once information has passed to a new location outside of the source's control there is no way of ensuring it is not propagated further, and therefore will naturally tend towards a state where that information is widely distributed.  Much of its force is due to the [[pathetic fallacy|anthropomorphic metaphor]] that imputes desire to information.  In 1990 [[Richard Stallman]] restated the concept normatively, without the anthropomorphization:

{{quote|I believe that all generally useful information should be free. By 'free' I am not referring to price, but rather to the freedom to copy the information and to adapt it to one's own uses... When information is generally useful, redistributing it makes humanity wealthier no matter who is distributing and no matter who is receiving.&lt;ref name ="denning"&gt;{{citation | authorlink = Dorothy E. Denning | first = Dorothy E | last = Denning | contribution = Concerning Hackers Who Break into Computer Systems | title = Proceedings of the 13th National [[Computer Security]] Conference | place = Washington, DC | date = October 1990 | pages = 653–64 | contribution-url = http://www.cs.georgetown.edu/~denning/hackers/Hackers-NCSC.txt | publisher = Georgetown}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stallman's reformulation incorporates a political stance into Brand's [[Value judgment|value-neutral]] observation of social trends.

==Cyberpunks==
{{Main|Cyberpunk}}
Brand's attribution of will to an abstract human construct (information) has been adopted within a branch of the [[cyberpunk]] movement, whose members espouse a particular political ([[anarchist]]) viewpoint. The construction of the statement takes its meaning beyond the simple judgmental observation, "Information ''should'' be free" by acknowledging that the internal force or [[entelechy]] of information and knowledge makes it essentially incompatible with notions of [[proprietary software]], copyrights, patents, [[subscription service]]s, etc. They believe that information is dynamic, ever-growing and evolving and cannot be contained within (any) [[ideological]] structure.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

According to this philosophy, [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]], [[Software cracking|cracker]]s, and [[phreaker]]s are liberators of information which is being held hostage by agents demanding money for its release. Other participants in this network include [[Cypherpunk|cypherpunks]] who educate people to use [[public-key cryptography]] to protect the privacy of their messages from corporate or governmental snooping and [[programmer]]s who write free software and [[open source]] [[code]]. Still others create [[Free-Net]]s allowing users to gain access to computer resources for which they would otherwise need an account. They might also break copyright law  by swapping music, movies, or other copyrighted materials over the Internet.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

[[Chelsea Manning]] is alleged to have said "Information should be free"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/06/wikileaks-chat/ |title=‘I Can’t Believe What I’m Confessing to You’: The Wikileaks Chats |author=KEVIN POULSEN AND KIM ZETTER |work=Wired.com |date=6 October 2013 |accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Adrian Lamo]] when explaining a rationale for US government documents to be released to [[WikiLeaks]]. The narrative goes on with Manning wondering if she is a "'hacker', 'cracker', 'hacktivist', 'leaker' or what".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nymag.com/news/features/bradley-manning-2011-7/index6.html |title=How Bradley Manning Became One of the Most Unusual Revolutionaries in American History |author=[[Steve Fishman]] |work=[[New York Magazine]] |date=3 July 2011 |accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary usage==
In the "Fall Revolution" series of science-fiction books, anarchist sci-fi author [[Ken Macleod]] riffs and puns on the expression by writing about entities composed of information actually "wanting", as in desiring, freedom and the scheming of several human characters with differing political and ideological agenda, to facilitate or disrupt these entities' quest for freedom.

In the cyberpunk world of [[Technological singularity|post-singularity]] transhuman culture described by [[Charles Stross]] in his books like ''[[Accelerando (novel)|Accelerando]]'' and ''[[Singularity Sky]]'', the wish of information to be free is a law of nature.&lt;ref name="accelerando"&gt;{{citation | url = http://trashotron.com/agony/reviews/2005/stross-accelerando.htm | title = Stross Accelerando | publisher = Trashotron | accessdate = 2011-04-23 | format = review | year = 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Singularity Sky"&gt;{{citation | last = Stross | first = Charles | date = 2010-04-01 | url = http://heliologue.com/2010/04/01/singularity-sky/ | title = Singularity Sky – A Modest Construct | publisher = Heliologue | accessdate = 2011-04-23}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Psychological Morphology38?.jpg|thumb| [[Roberto Matta]]'s ''Psychological Morphology'', (painted in about 1938), with its landscape-like blue sky and horizon, combined with [[biomorphism|biomorphically]] suggestive and fluidly interacting figures, is a good example of what Prof. Claude Cernuschi ([[Boston College]]) has identified in Matta's work as "the psychoanalytic view of the mind as a three-dimensional space: the 'inscape'."]] 

'''Inscape''', in [[visual art]], is a term especially associated with certain works of [[Chile]]an artist [[Roberto Matta]], but it is also used in other senses within the [[visual arts]]. Though the term ''inscape'' has been applied to stylistically diverse artworks, it usually conveys some notion of representing the artist's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as a kind of interior [[landscape art|landscape]]. The word ''inscape'' can therefore be read as a kind of [[portmanteau]], combining ''interior'' (or ''inward'') with ''landscape''.

==The psychological inscape: surrealist, abstract, and fantastic art==

According to Professor Claude Cernuschi, writing in a catalogue for a Matta exhibition at [[Boston College]] (see external link below), Matta's use of the term ''inscape'' for a series of [[landscape art|landscape]]-like [[abstract art|abstract]] or [[surrealist]] [[painting]]s reflects "the [[psychoanalytic]] view of the mind as a three-dimensional space: the 'inscape'." The 'inscape' concept is particularly apt for Matta's works of the late 1930s. As [[Dawn Adès]] (p. 233) writes, "A series of brilliant oil paintings done during the years of his [Matta's] first association with the [[Surrealist]]s explore visual metaphors for the mental landscape." And Valerie Fletcher, in ''Crosscurrents of Modernism'' (p. 241), writes that during this time Matta "created with startling mastery the paintings he called 'inscapes' or 'psychological morphologies.' " See also Miriam Basilio's essay, "[[Wifredo Lam]]'s 'The Jungle' and Matta's 'Inscapes' ".

The term ''inscape'' was later taken up by the leading Australian surrealist [[James Gleeson]], American [[abstract art]]ists such as [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], [[Jane Frank]], and [[Mary Frank]] (no relation), and even a group of British [[fantasy art]]ists founded by [[Brigid Marlin]] in 1961 and calling themselves the 'Inscape Group.' (The latter group may have had in mind another sense of the word '[[inscape]]', associated with the British poet [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]]. See the article titled simply '[[inscape]]' for more information on this.)  More recently, in a 1998 review of a Mary Frank exhibition in [[New York City]] (cited below), Carol Diehl writes, "Titled 'Inscapes', the [[painting]]s are [[landscape art|landscapes]] of the [[soul]]...."

Also clearly referring to the psychoanalytical meaning of the word as described by Prof. Cernuschi and others above, the leading journal of [[art therapy]] was formerly called simply ''Inscape''.  The journal is now called ''International journal of art therapy : Inscape.'' (This is not to be confused with the ''Inscape'' magazine produced by Brigid Marlin's [[Society for Art of Imagination]].)

==Architectural interiors as 'inscapes'==
The word "inscape" is sometimes used, perhaps with a bit of poetic license, to refer to the domain of [[interior design]], suggesting that the interior of a house or building is a kind of interior (or indoor) landscape, a counterpart to the landscape surrounding the structure. This is the sense suggested by the name of the [[South Africa]]n interior design school [[Inscape Design College]], which see. It could be, however, that this use of the term is intended as a [[double-entendre]], evoking those other meanings of "inscape".

'''Javanshir Fortress''' is a defensive fortress located located 4 km north of the village of [[Talıstan|Talystan]] in the Ismayilli region, on the right bank of Aghcachay.&lt;ref name="azertag"/&gt; The castle was built by the ruler [[Javanshir]] during the reign of Mehranids dynasty in the Caucasus Albania. The fortress is named after him. It is believed that the fortress was used as an administrative center.&lt;ref name="gomap"/&gt;

==Structure==
The fortress was constructed of [[Lime (material)|lime]] and river stones. The area of the fortress is about 1.5 – 2 hectares. It consists of fortress and an inner fortress called Naringala. It is surrounded by valley of the Agchay river from three sides. The complex consists of the main part and Ichgala. The polygonal shaped Ichgala was built on the highest point of the mountain. In most places only basis of it remains. The walls of the Ichgala are demolished. Thickness of the southern wall of the main portion is 2 meters and its height is more than 10 meters. The western walls were completely destroyed by landslides. The defense complex includes 6 towers and their height are up to 8 meters.&lt;ref name="azertag"&gt;{{cite web|title= Cavanşir qalası |url= http://portal.azertag.az/az/node/2031|publisher= portal.azertag.az |language= az|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the northern end of the tower there is a wall with a width of 2 meters and a ledge length of 50 meters. The wall is completed with a cylinder-shaped tower. The entrance to the castle was only from the southern side. There was a gate place with 2.5 m width. There were comb-shaped [[merlon]]s about 0.5 m from each other on top of the walls. Tower was built to strengthen walls of the castle.&lt;ref name="gomap"&gt;{{cite web|title= Cavanşir qalası (İsmayıllı) |url= https://kataloq.gomap.az/az/all-poi/culture/defensive-structure/8d4e3bf2d56611e0ad4900226424597d|publisher= kataloq.gomap.az |language= az|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ichgala is in the northern part of the fortress. Towers are four-cornered on the south, and rounded on other sides. Some of their diameters reach 8 meters. The main surveillance point is located at the northern end of the fortress. There used to be a hidden path on the north-eastern side of the fortress. This gave opportunity to the fortress to communicate with outside during a blockade.&lt;ref name="gomap"/&gt;

The exact scheme of the it was first compiled by Professor, Doctor of Geographical Sciences, Ramazan Tarverdiyev in 1963.&lt;ref name="azpress"&gt;{{cite web|title= Tariximizin bu günədək gəlib çatan silinməz izi - Cavanşir qalası|url= http://azpress.az/index.php?lang=az&amp;sectionid=news&amp;id=57348|publisher= azpress.az |language= az|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johann Nepomuk Hoechle''' (16 September 1790, [[Munich]] - 12 December 1835, [[Vienna]]) was an Austrian painter and [[lithographer]] who specialized in scenes from military actions and current events.

== Biography ==
His father was Johann Baptist Hoechle (1754-1832), an artist from Switzerland who later became [[court painter]] for the [[Habsburgs]]. When he was still a child, he was apprenticed to the engraver and etcher, [[Ferdinand Kobell]],&lt;ref name="B"&gt;[https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/BLK%C3%96:Hoechle,_Johann_Nepomuk Brief biography] @ German WikiSource.&lt;/ref&gt; who died shortly after, in 1799. The following year, his father took him to Vienna. From 1804 to 1808, he was enrolled at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna|Academy of Fine Arts]], where he studied history painting with [[Heinrich Friedrich Füger]]&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie|12|523|523|Hoechle, Joh. Nep. d. J.|Karl Weiß|ADB:Höchle, Johann Nepomuk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and landscape painting with [[Michael Wutky]]. His later career as a battle painter probably came from the influence of the French marine and military artist, Ignace Duvivier (1758-1832), who Hoechle met while he was visiting Vienna.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;

This may be what inspired Hoechle, in 1809, to make sketches of the ongoing [[Battle of Aspern]] from a hillside near [[Heiligenstadt, Vienna|Heiligenstadt]]. He was found and arrested by French soldiers, who thought he was a spy and were going to have him shot. Luckily, he spoke French and was able to convince the commanding officer that they were mistaken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pfarre.aspern.at/Chronik/Geschichte/hoechle.php "Wer War Hoechle?"] by Johannes Holba @ Pfarre Aspern.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:HGM Hoechle Der Übergang über die Vogesen.jpg|thumb|300px|The Crossing of the Vosges.]]
In 1814, after further studies in military art, he made more sketches at the scenes of major events, on behalf of Austrian Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]], and turned them into paintings at his studio.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; His most important work from this period, and his best-known overall, depicts the crossing of the [[Vosges Mountains]], following Napoleon's defeat at the [[Battle of Leipzig]]. 

In 1819, he accompanied the Emperor's entourage to Italy, followed in 1820 by attendance at major military maneuvers in Hungary.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; That same year, he did a portrait of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and, shortly after the composer's death in 1827, made a detailed sketch of his study (where he died) in the "Schwarzspanierhaus".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beethoven-haus-bonn.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=&amp;template=dokseite_digitales_archiv_en&amp;_dokid=bi:i3645&amp;_seite=1 Beethovens Sterbezimmer] @ the [[Beethoven-Haus]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1833, he was chosen to succeed his father as court painter, but died only two years later.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

[[Baron]] '''Giulio Cesare Andrea Evola''' ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|ˈ|v|oʊ|l|ə}}; {{IPA-it|ˈɛːvola|lang}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |article=Evola cogn. |publisher=[[Rai Libri]] |encyclopedia=Dizionario d'Ortografia e di Pronunzia (DOP)  |url=http://www.dizionario.rai.it/poplemma.aspx?lid=61429&amp;r=90351 |accessdate=2018-10-23 &lt;!--Feb 13 2017--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19 May 1898 – 11 June 1974), better known as '''Julius Evola''', was an Italian [[philosopher]], painter, and [[Western esotericism|esotericist]]. He has been described as a "fascist intellectual,"&lt;ref&gt;Cyprian Blamires. ''World Fascism: a historical encyclopedia, vol 1''. ABC-CLIO, 2006. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; a "radical traditionalist,"&lt;ref name="packer2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Packer |first=Jeremy |title=Secret agents popular icons beyond James Bond |location=New York |publisher=Lang |year=2009 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; "antiegalitarian, antiliberal, antidemocratic, and antipopular,"&lt;ref name="Atkins, Stephen E. 2004. p 89"&gt;Atkins, Stephen E.

Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004. p 89.&lt;/ref&gt; and as having been "the leading philosopher of Europe's neofascist movement."&lt;ref name="Atkins, Stephen E. 2004. p 89"/&gt;

Evola is popular in fringe circles, largely because of his extreme metaphysical, magical, and supernatural beliefs (including belief in ghosts, telepathy, and alchemy),&lt;ref&gt;Horrox, James. "Julius Evola". The Literary Encyclopedia. First published 20 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and his extreme [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalism]] and [[misogyny]]. He himself termed his philosophy "magical idealism." Many of Evola's theories and writings were centered on his idiosyncratic [[mysticism]], [[occultism]], and esoteric religious studies,&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=occult/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;  and this aspect of his work has influenced [[occult]]ists and esotericists. Evola also justified rape (among other forms of male domination of women) because he saw it "as a natural expression of male desire". This misogynistic outlook stemmed from his extreme right views on [[gender role]]s, which demanded absolute submission from women.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=occult/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Merelli/&gt;&lt;ref name=haaretz /&gt;

According to the scholar Franco Ferraresi, "Evola's thought can be considered one of the most radical and consistent anti-egalitarian, [[Liberalism#Criticism and support|anti-liberal]], [[criticism of democracy|anti-democratic]], and anti-popular systems in the twentieth century. It is a singular (though not necessarily original) blend of several schools and traditions, including [[German idealism]], Eastern doctrines, traditionalism, and the all-embracing ''[[world view|Weltanschauung]]'' of the interwar [[conservative revolutionary movement]] with which Evola had a deep personal involvement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Franco Ferraresi|title=Threats to Democracy: The Radical Right in Italy after the War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r0DG3uk9o8oC&amp;pg=PA44|year=2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1-4008-2211-4|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Aaron Gillette described Evola as "one of the most influential fascist racists in Italian history".&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillette|first=Aaron|authorlink=Aaron Gillette|title=Racial Theories in Fascist Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Gjq0ZPvIZgC|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-52706-9|chapter=7: Julia Evola and spiritual Nordicism, 1941-1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; He admired SS head [[Heinrich Himmler]], whom he once met.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002"/&gt; Evola spent [[World War II]] working for the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]''.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; During his trial in 1951, Evola denied being a fascist and instead referred to himself as a "superfascist". Concerning this statement, historian Elisabetta Cassina Wolff wrote that "It is unclear whether this meant that Evola was placing himself above or beyond Fascism".&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt;

==Life==
Giulio Cesare Andrea Evola was born in Rome to a minor aristocratic family of Sicilian origins. He was a [[baron]]. Little is known about his early upbringing except that he considered it irrelevant. Evola studied engineering in Rome, but did not complete his studies because he "did not want to be associated in any way with [[bourgeois]] academic recognition and titles such as doctor and engineer."&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011"&gt;Paul Furlong, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fVGkhzpXxLkC The Social and Political Thought of Julius Evola]''. London: Routledge, 2011. {{ISBN|9780203816912}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}&lt;ref name="Evola, Cinabro"&gt;Julius Evola, Il Camino del Cinabro, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

In his teenage years, Evola immersed himself in painting—which he considered one of his natural talents—and literature, including [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]]. He was introduced to philosophers such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Otto Weininger]]. Other early philosophical influences included [[Carlo Michelstaedter]] and [[Max Stirner]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Griffin, Matthew Feldman. ''Fascism: Post-war fascisms''. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004. p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

Evola served in [[World War I]] as an [[artillery]] officer on the [[Asiago]] plateau. He was attracted to the [[avant-garde]] and after the war, Evola briefly associated with [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]]'s [[Futurism|Futurist]] movement. He became a prominent representative of [[Dada]]ism in Italy through his painting, poetry, and collaboration on the briefly published journal, ''Revue Bleue''. In 1922, after concluding that avant-garde art was becoming [[commercialized]] and stiffened by academic conventions, he reduced his focus on artistic expression such as painting and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;G.Evola, ''Il Camino del Cinabro'', 1963&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary inline|date=July 2017}}

Evola died on 11 June 1974 in Rome.&lt;ref name="treccani"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Luca Lo Bianco |language=it |title=EVOLA, Giulio Cesare Andrea |encyclopedia=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani |trans-title=Biographical Dictionary of Italians |volume=43 |year=1993 |publisher=Treccani |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giulio-cesare-andrea-evola_(Dizionario-Biografico) |accessdate=2018-10-23 |quote=Morì a Roma l'11 giugno 1974 e le ceneri, per sua volontà, furono sepolte sul Monte Rosa.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{how|date=June 2018}}

==Works==

===Christianity===
In 1928, Evola wrote an attack on Christianity titled ''Pagan Imperialism'', which proposed transforming fascism into a system consistent with ancient Roman values and the ancient mystery traditions. Evola proposed that fascism should be a vehicle for reinstating the caste system and aristocracy of antiquity. Although Evola invoked the term "fascism" in this text, his diatribe against the Catholic Church was criticized by both the fascist regime and the Vatican itself. [[A. James Gregor]] argued that the text was an attack on fascism as it stood at the time of writing, but noted that [[Benito Mussolini]] made use of it in order to threaten the Vatican with the possibility of an "anti-clerical fascism".&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name=gregor2006&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregor|first1=A. James|authorlink1=A. James Gregor|title=The search for neofascism : the use and abuse of social science|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521676397}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|89–91}} On account of Evola's sentiment, the Vatican-backed right wing Catholic journal ''Revue Internationale des Sociétés Secrètes'' published an article in April 1928 entitled "Un Sataniste Italien: Julius Evola."&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;

''The Mystery of the Grail'' discarded Christian interpretations of the [[Holy Grail]]. Evola wrote that the Grail "symbolizes the principle of an immortalizing and transcendent force connected to the primordial state ... The mystery of the Grail is a mystery of a warrior initiation." He held that the Ghibellines, who fought the Guelph for control of Northern and Central Italy in the thirteenth century, had within them the residual influences of pre-Christian Celtic and Nordic traditions that represented his conception of the Grail myth. He also held that the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph victory against the Ghibellines]] represented a regression of the castes, since the merchant caste took over from the warrior caste.&lt;ref name=Sedgwick/&gt; In the epilogue to this text, Evola argued that the fictitious ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', regardless of whether it was authentic or not, was a cogent representation of modernity.&lt;ref name=Barber&gt;Richard W. Barber. ''The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief''. Harvard University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Richard Barber]] said, "Evola mixes rhetoric, prejudice, scholarship, and politics into a strange version of the present and future, but in the process he brings together for the first time interest in the esoteric and in conspiracy theory which characterize much of the later Grail literature."&lt;ref name=Barber/&gt;

===Buddhism===
In ''The Doctrine of Awakening'', Evola argued that the [[Pāli Canon]] could be held to represent true [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=forum/&gt; His interpretation of Buddhism is that it was intended to be anti-democratic. He believed that Buddhism revealed the essence of an "Aryan" tradition that had become corrupted and lost in the West. He believed it could be interpreted to reveal the superiority of a warrior caste.&lt;ref name=forum/&gt; [[Harry Oldmeadow]] described Evola's work on Buddhism as exhibiting Nietzschean influence,&lt;ref&gt;Harry Oldmeadow. ''Journeys East: 20th Century Western Encounters with Eastern Religious Traditions''. World Wisdom, Inc, 2004. p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; but Evola criticized Nietzsche's anti-ascetic prejudice.&lt;ref name=forum&gt;T. Skorupski. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=yYSAAAAAQBAJ The Buddhist Forum, Volume 4]''. Routledge, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The book "received the official approbation of the Pāli [text] society", and was published by a reputable Orientalist publisher.&lt;ref name=forum/&gt; Evola's interpretation of Buddhism, as put forth in his article "Spiritual Virility in Buddhism", is in conflict with the post-WWII scholarship of the Orientalist [[Giuseppe Tucci]], which argues that the viewpoint that Buddhism advocates universal benevolence is legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;Donald S. Lopez. ''Curators of the Buddha: The Study of Buddhism Under Colonialism''. University of Chicago Press, 1995. p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Versluis]] stated that Evola's writing on Buddhism was a vehicle for his own theories, but was a far from accurate rendition of the subject, and he held that much the same could be said of Evola's writing on Hermeticism.&lt;ref name=Versluis&gt;Arthur Versluis. ''Magic and Mysticism: An Introduction to Western Esoteric Traditions''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2007. p. 144-145&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nanavira Thera|Ñāṇavīra Thera]] was inspired to become a [[bhikkhu]] from reading Evola's text ''The Doctrine of Awakening'' in 1945 while hospitalized in [[Sorrento]].&lt;ref name=forum/&gt;

===Modernity===
Evola's ''[[Revolt Against the Modern World]]'' is a text that promotes the mythology of an ancient [[Golden Age]]. In this work, Evola described the features of his idealized traditional society. Evola argued that modernity represented a serious decline from an ideal society. He argued that in the postulated Golden age, religious and temporal power were united. He wrote that society had not been founded on priestly rule, but by warriors expressing spiritual power. In mythology, he saw evidence of the West's superiority over the East. Moreover, he claimed that the traditional elite had the ability to access power and knowledge through a hierarchical version of magic which differed from the lower "superstitious and fraudulent" forms of magic.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; Evola insists on "nonmodern forms, institutions, and knowledge" as being necessary to produce a "real renewal ... in those who are still capable of receiving it."&lt;ref name=Versluis/&gt; The text was "immediately recognized by [[Mircea Eliade]] and other intellectuals who allegedly advanced ideas associated with Tradition."&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; Eliade, one of Evola's closest friends, was a fascist sympathizer associated with the Romanian fascist [[Iron Guard]].&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Evola was aware of the importance of myth from his readings of [[Georges Sorel]], one of the key intellectual influences on fascism.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; [[Hermann Hesse]] described ''Revolt Against the Modern World'' as "really dangerous."&lt;ref name=Sedgwick&gt;Mark Sedgwick. ''Against the Modern World: Traditionalism and the Secret Intellectual History of the Twentieth Century''. Oxford University Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

E. C. Wolff noted that in ''Ride the Tiger'' "Evola argued that the fight against modernity was lost. The only thing a 'real man' could just do was to ride the tiger of modernity patiently". Evola wrote that the events of the period would have to run their course but he "did not exclude the possibility of action in the future." He argued that one should be ready to intervene when the tiger "is tired of running."&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; Goodrick-Clarke notes that, "Evola sets up the ideal of the 'active nihilist' who is prepared to act with violence against modern decadence."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; According to European Studies professor Paul Furlong, this text presents Evola's view that the potential "elite" should immunize itself from modernity and use "right wing anarchism" to rebel against it.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt;

===Other writings===
In the posthumously published collection of writings, ''Metaphysics of War'', Evola, in line with the conservative revolutionary [[Ernst Jünger]], explored the viewpoint that war could be a spiritually fulfilling experience. He proposed the necessity of a transcendental orientation in a warrior.&lt;ref&gt;Lennart Svensson. ''Ernst Junger – A Portrait''. Manticore Books, 2016. p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] has written that Evola's 1945 essay "American 'Civilization'" described the United States as "the final stage of European decline into the 'interior formlessness' of vacuous individualism, conformity and vulgarity under the universal [[aegis]] of money-making." According to Goodrick-Clarke, Evola argued that U.S. "mechanistic and rational philosophy of progress combined with a mundane horizon of prosperity to transform the world into an enormous suburban shopping mall."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Occultism and esotericism==
Around 1920, Evola's interests led him into [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]], and "supra-rational" studies. He began reading various esoteric texts and gradually delved deeper into the occult, [[alchemy]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], and [[Oriental studies]], particularly [[Vajrayana|Tibetan Tantric]] [[yoga]]. A keen mountaineer, Evola described the experience as a source of revelatory spiritual experiences. After his return from the war, Evola experimented with [[hallucinogen]]s and magic.

When he was about 23 years old, Evola considered suicide. He claimed that he avoided suicide thanks to a revelation he had while reading an early Buddhist text that dealt with shedding all forms of identity other than absolute transcendence.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; Evola would later publish the text ''The Doctrine of Awakening'', which he regarded as a repayment of his debt to [[Buddhism]] for saving him from suicide.&lt;ref name=forum/&gt;

Evola wrote prodigiously on Eastern mysticism, Tantra, [[hermeticism]], the myth of the Holy Grail and Western esotericism.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; German Egyptologist and esoteric scholar Florian Ebeling has noted that Evola's ''The Hermetic Tradition'' is viewed as an "extremely important work on Hermeticism" in the eyes of esotericists.&lt;ref&gt;Florian Ebeling. ''The Secret History of Hermes Trismegistus: Hermeticism from Ancient to Modern Times''. Cornell University Press, 2007. p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Evola gave particular focus to Cesare della Riviera's text ''Il Mondo Magico degli Heroi'', which he later republished in modern Italian. He held that Riviera's text was consonant with the goals of "high magic" – the reshaping of the earthly human into a transcendental 'god man'. According to Evola, the alleged "timeless" Traditional science was able to come to lucid expression through this text, in spite of the "coverings" added to it to prevent accusations from the church.&lt;ref name=Hermeticism/&gt; Though Evola rejected [[Carl Jung]]'s interpretation of alchemy, Jung described Evola's ''The Hermetic Tradition'' as a "magisterial account of Hermetic philosophy".&lt;ref name=Hermeticism&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rNOYDQAAQBAJ Lux in Tenebris: The Visual and the Symbolic in Western Esotericism]''. BRILL, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition'', the philosopher Glenn Alexander Magee favored Evola's interpretation over that of Jung's.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Alexander Magee. ''Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition''. Cornell University Press, 2008. p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, a journal devoted to Hermetic thought published a section of Evola's book and described it as "Luciferian."&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;

Evola later confessed that he was not a Buddhist, and that his text on Buddhism was meant to balance his earlier work on the Hindu ''tantras''.&lt;ref name=forum/&gt; Evola's interest in [[tantra]] was spurred on by correspondence with [[John Woodroffe]].&lt;ref name="Gary Lachman 2012. p. 215"/&gt; Evola was attracted to the active aspect of tantra, and its claim to provide a practical means to spiritual experience, over the more "passive" approaches in other forms of Eastern spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Taylor. ''Sir John Woodroffe, Tantra and Bengal: 'An Indian Soul in a European Body?' ''. Routledge, 2012. p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Tantric Buddhism in East Asia'', Richard K. Payne, Dean of the Institute of Buddhist Studies, argued that Evola manipulated Tantra in the service of right wing violence, and that the emphasis on "power" in ''The Yoga of Power'' gave insight into his mentality.&lt;ref&gt;Richard K. Payne. ''Tantric Buddhism in East Asia''. Simon and Schuster, 2006. p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

Evola advocated that "differentiated individuals" following the [[Left-hand path and right-hand path#Left-Hand Path|Left-Hand Path]] use dark violent sexual powers against the modern world. For Evola, these "virile heroes" are both generous and cruel, possess the ability to rule, and commit "Dionysian" acts that might be seen as conventionally immoral. For Evola, the Left Hand path embraces violence as a means of transgression.&lt;ref name=occult/&gt;{{rp|217}}

According to [[A. James Gregor]] Evola's definition of spirituality can be found in ''Meditations on the Peaks'': "what has been successfully actualized and translated into a sense of superiority which is experienced inside by the soul, and a noble demeanor, which is expressed in the body."&lt;ref name=gregor2006/&gt;{{rp|101–102}} Goodrick-Clarke wrote that Evola's "rigorous [[New Age]] spirituality speaks directly to those who reject absolutely the leveling world of democracy, capitalism, multi-racialism and technology at the outset of the twenty-first century. Their acute sense of cultural chaos can find powerful relief in his ideal of total renewal."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Thomas Sheehan (academic)|Thomas Sheehan]] wrote that to "read Evola is to take a trip through a weird and fascinating jungle of ancient mythologies, pseudo-ethnology, and transcendental mysticism that is enough to make any southern California consciousness-tripper feel quite at home."&lt;ref name=sheehanterror&gt;Thomas Sheehan. [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/7178 Italy: Terror on the Right]. ''The New York Review of Books'', Volume 27, Number 21 &amp; 22, January 22, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magical idealism===
[[Thomas Sheehan (academic)|Thomas Sheehan]] wrote that "Evola's first philosophical works from the 'twenties were dedicated to reshaping neo-idealism from a philosophy of Absolute Spirit and Mind into a philosophy of the "absolute individual" and action."&lt;ref name=Sheehan/&gt; Accordingly, Evola developed the doctrine of "[[magical idealism]]", which held that "the Ego must understand that everything that seems to have a reality independent of it is nothing but an illusion, caused by its own deficiency."&lt;ref name=Sheehan/&gt; For Evola, this ever-increasing unity with the "absolute individual" was consistent with unconstrained liberty, and therefore unconditional power.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; In his 1925 work ''Essays on Magical Idealism'', Evola declared that "God does not exist. The Ego must create him by making itself divine."&lt;ref name=Sheehan/&gt;

According to Sheehan, Evola discovered the power of metaphysical mythology while developing his theories. This led to his advocacy of supra-rational intellectual intuition over discursive knowledge. In Evola's view, discursive knowledge separates man from Being.&lt;ref name=Sheehan/&gt; Sheehan stated that this position is a theme in certain interpretations of Western philosophers such as [[Plato]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and [[Martin Heidegger]] that was exaggerated by Evola.&lt;ref name=Sheehan&gt;Thomas Sheehan. ''Myth and Violence: The Fascism of Julius Evola and Alain de Benoist''. Social Research, XLVIII, 1 (Spring, 1981). 45–73&lt;/ref&gt; Evola would later write:

{{quote|The truths that allow us to understand the world of Tradition are not those that can be "learned" or "discussed." They either are or are not. We can only ''remember'' them, and that happens when we are freed from the obstacles represented by various human constructions (chief among these are the results and methods of the authorized "researchers") and have awakened the capacity to ''see'' from the nonhuman viewpoint, which is the same as the Traditional viewpoint ... Traditional truths have always been held to be essentially ''non-human''.&lt;ref name=Sheehan/&gt;}}

Evola developed a doctrine of the "two natures": the natural world and the primordial "world of 'Being'". He believed that these "two natures" impose form and quality on lower matter and create a hierarchical "great chain of Being."&lt;ref name=Sheehan/&gt; He understood "spiritual virility" as signifying orientation towards this postulated transcendent principle.&lt;ref name=Sheehan/&gt; He held that the State should reflect this "ordering from above" and the consequent hierarchical differentiation of individuals according to their "organic preformation". By "organic preformation" he meant that which "gathers, preserves, and refines one's talents and qualifications for determinate functions."&lt;ref name=Sheehan/&gt;

===Ur Group===
Evola was introduced to esotericism by [[Arturo Reghini]], who was an early supporter of fascism. Reghini sought to promote a "cultured magic" opposed to Christianity and introduced Evola to the traditionalist [[René Guénon]]. In 1927, Reghini and Evola, along with other Italian esotericists, founded the ''Gruppo di Ur'' ("[[Ur]] Group").&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; The purpose of this group was to attempt to bring the members' individual identities into such a superhuman state of power and awareness that they would be able to exert a magical influence on the world. The group employed techniques from Buddhist, Tantric, and rare Hermetic texts.&lt;ref&gt;Nevill Drury. ''The Dictionary of the Esoteric: 3000 Entries on the Mystical and Occult Traditions''. Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 2004. p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; They aimed to provide a "soul" to the burgeoning Fascist movement of the time through the revival of [[religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], and to influence the fascist regime through esotericism.&lt;ref&gt;Isotta Poggi. "Alternative Spirituality in Italy." In: James R. Lewis, J. Gordon Melton. ''Perspectives on the New Age.'' SUNY Press, 1992. Page 276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt;

Articles on occultism from the Ur Group were later published in ''Introduction to Magic''.&lt;ref name=gregor2006/&gt;{{rp|89}}&lt;ref name="Gary Lachman 2012. p. 215"&gt;Gary Lachman. ''Politics and the Occult: The Left, the Right, and the Radically Unseen''. Quest Books, 2012. p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; Reghini's support of [[Freemasonry]] would however prove a bone of contention for Evola; accordingly, Evola broke with Reghini in 1928.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; Reghini himself broke from Evola, accusing Evola of plagiarizing his thoughts in the book ''Pagan Imperialism''.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Evola, on the other hand, blamed Reghini for the premature publication of ''Pagan Imperialism''.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; Evola's later work owed a considerable debt to René Guénon's text ''Crisis of the Modern World'',&lt;ref name=Versluis/&gt; though he diverged from Guénon on the issue of the relationship between warriors and priests.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt;

===Views on sex and gender roles===
Julius Evola believed that the alleged higher qualities expected of a man of a particular race were not those expected of a woman of the same race. He held that "just relations between the sexes" involved women acknowledging their "inequality" with men.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; In 1925, he wrote an article titled ''"La donna come cosa"'' ("Woman as Thing").&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt; Evola later quoted [[Joseph de Maistre]]'s statement that "Woman cannot be superior except as woman, but from the moment in which she desires to emulate man she is nothing but a monkey."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Griffin, Matthew Feldman. ''Fascism: Post-war fascisms''. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004. p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Evola believed that [[women's liberation movement|women's liberation]] was "the renunciation by woman of her right to be a woman".&lt;ref&gt;Franco Ferraresi. ''Threats to Democracy: The Radical Right in Italy after the War''. Princeton University Press, 2012. p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; A woman "could traditionally participate in the sacred hierarchical order only in a mediated fashion through her relationship with a man."&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; He held, as a feature of his idealized gender relations, the Hindu [[sati (practice)|sati]], which for him was a form of sacrifice indicating women's respect for patriarchal traditions.&lt;ref&gt;R. Ben-Ghiat, M. Fuller. ''Italian Colonialism''. Springer, 2016. p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; For the "pure, feminine" woman, "man is not perceived by her as a mere husband or lover, but as her lord."&lt;ref name=Merelli/&gt; Women would find their true identity in total subjugation to men.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;

Evola regarded matriarchy and goddess religions as a symptom of decadence, and preferred a hyper-masculine, warrior ethos.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann. ''Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices, 2nd Edition [6 volumes]: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices''. ABC-CLIO, 2010. p. 1085&lt;/ref&gt;

Evola was influenced by [[Hans Blüher]]; he was a proponent of the ''[[Secret society#Characteristics|Männerbund]]'' concept as a model for his proposed ultra-fascist "Order".&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Goodrick-Clarke noted the fundamental influence of [[Otto Weininger]]'s misogynist book ''[[Sex and Character]]'' on Evola's dualism of male-female spirituality. According to Goodrich-Clarke, "Evola's celebration of virile spirituality was rooted in Weininger's work, which was widely translated by the end of the First World War."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Unlike Weininger, Evola believed that women needed to be conquered, not ignored.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Evola denounced [[homosexuality]] as "useless" for his purposes. He did not neglect [[sadomasochism]], so long as sadism and masochism "are magnifications of an element potentially present in the deepest essence of [[eros]]."&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Then, it would be possible to "extend, in a transcendental and perhaps [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] way, the possibilities of sex."&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;

Evola held that women "played" with men, threatened their masculinity, and lured them into a "constrictive" grasp with their sexuality.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002" /&gt; He wrote that "It should not be expected of women that they return to what they really are ... when men themselves retain only the semblance of true virility",&lt;ref name=Merelli/&gt; and lamented that "men instead of being in control of sex are controlled by it and wander about like drunkards".&lt;ref name=occult/&gt; He believed that in Tantra and in [[sex magic]], in which he saw a strategy for aggression, he found the means to counter the "emasculated" West.&lt;ref name=occult&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Lycourinos|editor1-first=Damon Zacharias|title=Occult traditions|date=2012|publisher=Numen Books|isbn=9780987158130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IOG3fu3dss4C|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=haaretz&gt;{{cite news |last1=Arad |first1=Roy |title=How an Israeli Bookstore in Berlin Ended Up Accused of Nazi Recruitment |url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-how-an-israeli-bookshop-in-berlin-ended-up-accused-of-nazi-recruitment-1.6053918 |accessdate=July 23, 2018 |work=Haaretz |date=May 3, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Annalisa Merelli, Evola "went so far as to justify rape" because he saw it "as a natural expression of male desire".&lt;ref name=Merelli/&gt; Evola also said that the "ritual violation of virgins",&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; and "whipping women" were a means of "consciousness raising",&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; so long as these practices were done to the intensity required to produce the proper "liminal psychic climate".&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; He wrote that "as a rule, nothing stirs a man more than feeling the woman utterly exhausted beneath his own hostile rapture."&lt;ref name=Merelli&gt;Annalisa Merelli.

[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]. February 22, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Evola translated Weininger's ''Sex and Character'' into Italian. Dissatisfied with simply translating Weininger's work, he wrote the text ''Eros and the Mysteries of Love: The Metaphysics of Sex'', where his views on sexuality were dealt with at length.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; [[Arthur Versluis]] described this text as Evola's "most interesting" work aside from ''[[Revolt Against the Modern World]]''.&lt;ref name=Versluis/&gt; This book remains popular among many New Age adherents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Conner |first1=Randy P. |last2=Sparks |first2=David Hatfield |last3=Sparks |first3=Mariya |date=1997 |title=Cassell's Encyclopedia of Queer Myth, Symbol, and Spirit: Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Lore |publisher=Cassell |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on race==
{{anchor|Race}}
Evola's dissent from standard biological concepts of race had roots in his aristocratic elitism, since Nazi ''[[Völkisch movement|völkisch]]'' ideology inadequately separated aristocracy from "commoners."&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; According to Furlong, Evola developed "the law of the regression of castes" in ''[[Revolt Against the Modern World]]'' and other writings on racism from the 1930s and World War II period. In Evola's view "power and civilization have progressed from one to another of the four castes—sacred leaders, warrior nobility, bourgeoisie (economy, 'merchants') and slaves".&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; Furlong explains: "for Evola, the core of racial superiority lay in the spiritual qualities of the higher castes, which expressed themselves in physical as well as in cultural features, but were not determined by them. The law of the regression of castes places racism at the core of Evola's philosophy, since he sees an increasing predominance of lower races as directly expressed through modern mass democracies."&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt;

In 1941, Evola's book ''Synthesis of the Doctrine of Race'' (Italian: ''Sintesi di Dottrina della Razza'') was published by [[Hoepli]]. It provides an overview of his ideas concerning race and [[eugenics]], introducing the concept of "spiritual racism",&lt;ref name="Rota2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rota|title=Intellettuali, dittatura, razzismo di stato|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGwiln0yQC4C&amp;pg=PA57|year=2008|publisher=FrancoAngeli|isbn=978-88-568-2094-2|pages=57–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "esoteric-traditionalist racism".&lt;ref name=cassata&gt;{{cite book|last=Cassata|first=Francisco|title=Building the New Man: Eugenics, Racial Science and Genetics in Twentieth-century Italy|publisher=Central European University Press|year=2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rZKPeD6CyAC&amp;pg=PA264&amp;lpg=PA264&amp;dq=%22Sintesi+di+Dottrina+della+Razza%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the end of War, Evola had frequently used the term "Aryan" to mean the nobility, who in his view were imbued with traditional spirituality.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; Wolff notes that Evola seems to have stopped writing about race in 1945, but adds that the intellectual themes of Evola's writings were otherwise unchanged. Evola continued to write about elitism and his contempt for the weak. His "doctrine of the Aryan-Roman 'super-race was simply restated as a doctrine of the 'leaders of men' ... no longer with reference to the SS, but to the mediaeval Teutonic knights of the Knights Templar, already mentioned in Rivolta."&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt;

Evola spoke of "inferior non-European races".&lt;ref name=Coogan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coogan|first1=Kevin|title=Dreamer of the day : Francis Parker Yockey and the postwar fascist international|date=1999|publisher=Autonomedia|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=9781570270390|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Wa7AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Merkl wrote that "Evola was never prepared to discount the value of blood altogether". Evola wrote: "a certain balanced consciousness and dignity of race can be considered healthy" in a time where "the exaltation of the negro and all the rest, anticolonialist psychosis and integrationist fanaticism [are] all parallel phenomena in the decline of Europe and the West."&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Merkl. ''Political Violence and Terror: Motifs and Motivations''. University of California Press, 1986. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; While not totally against race-mixing, in 1957, Evola wrote an article attributing the perceived acceleration of American decadence to the influence of "negroes" and the opposition to segregation. Furlong noted that this article is "among the most extreme in phraseology of any he wrote, and exhibits a degree of intolerance that leaves no doubt as to his deep prejudice against black people."&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt;

===National mysticism===
For his spiritual interpretation of the different racial psychologies, Evola found the work of German race theorist Ludwig Ferdinand Clauss invaluable. Like Evola, Clauss believed that physical race and spiritual race could diverge as a consequence of [[miscegenation]].&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002"/&gt; Evola's racism included racism of the body, soul, and spirit, giving primacy to the latter factor, writing that "races only declined when their spirit failed."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Like [[René Guénon]], Evola believed that mankind is living in the [[Kali Yuga]] of the [[Hindu]] tradition—the Dark Age of unleashed, materialistic appetites. He argued that both Italian fascism and [[Nazism]] represented hope that the "celestial" Aryan race would be reconstituted.&lt;ref name=intellectuals&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''Mussolini's Intellectuals: Fascist Social and Political Thought''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He drew on mythological accounts of super-races and their decline, particularly the [[Hyperborea]]ns, and maintained that traces of Hyperborean influence could be felt in Indo-European man. He felt that Indo-European men had devolved from these higher mythological races.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; Gregor noted that several contemporary criticisms of Evola's theory were published: "In one of Fascism's most important theoretical journals, Evola's critic pointed out that many Nordic-Aryans, not to speak of Mediterranean Aryans, fail to demonstrate any Hyperborean properties. Instead, they make obvious their materialism, their sensuality, their indifference to loyalty and sacrifice, together with their consuming greed. How do they differ from 'inferior' races, and why should anyone wish, in any way, to favor them?"&lt;ref name=gregor2006/&gt;{{rp|106}}

Concerning the relationship between "spiritual racism" and biological racism, Evola put forth the following viewpoint, which Furlong described as pseudo-scientific:

{{quote|The factor of "blood" or "race" has its importance, because it is not psychologically—in the brain or the opinions of the individual—but in the very deepest forces of life that traditions live and act as typical formative energies. Blood registers the effects of this action, and indeed offers through heredity, a matter that is already refined and pre-formed ...&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt;}}

===Views on Jews===
Evola endorsed [[Otto Weininger]]'s views on the Jews. Though Evola viewed Jews as corrosive and anti-traditional, he described [[Adolf Hitler]]'s more fanatical anti-Semitism as a paranoid [[Idée fixe (psychology)|idée fixe]] that damaged the reputation of the Third Reich.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Evola's conception did not emphasize the Nazi racial conception of Jews as "representatives of a biological race"—in Evola's view the Jews were "the carriers of a world view ... a spirit [that] corresponded to the 'worst' and 'most decadent' features of modernity: democracy, egalitarianism and materialism."&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt;

Evola argued that ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''—whether or not a forgery—accurately reflect the conditions of modernity.&lt;ref name=Barber/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He believed that the ''Protocols'' "contain the plan for an occult war, whose objective is the utter destruction, in the non-Jewish peoples, of all tradition, class, aristocracy, and hierarchy, and of all moral, religious, and spiritual values."&lt;ref name=religionfascism&gt;Horst Junginger. ''The Study of Religion Under the Impact of Fascism''. BRILL, 2008. p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote the foreword to the second Italian edition of the ''Protocols'', which was published by the Fascist [[Giovanni Preziosi]] in 1938.&lt;ref name=religionfascism/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dershowitz&gt;Oren Nimni and Nathan J. Robinson. ''[https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/11/alan-dershowitz-takes-anti-semitism-very-seriously-indeed Alan Dershowitz Takes Anti-Semitism Very Seriously Indeed]''. [[Current Affairs (magazine)|Current Affairs]]. November 16, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the murder of his friend [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], the leader of the Fascist Romanian [[Iron Guard]], Evola expressed anticipation of a "talmudic, Israelite tyranny."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, Evola believed that Jews had this "power" only because of European "decadence" in modernity.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; He also believed that one could be "Aryan", but have a "Jewish" soul, just as one could be "Jewish", but have an "Aryan" soul.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Lachman. ''Politics and the Occult: The Left, the Right, and the Radically Unseen''. Quest Books, 2012. p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; In Evola's view Otto Weininger and [[Carlo Michelstaedter]] were Jews of "sufficiently heroic, ascetic, and sacral" character to fit the latter category.&lt;ref name=gregor2006/&gt;{{rp|105}}

==Fascism==
Evola developed a complex line of argument, closely related to the spiritual orientation of Traditionalist writers such as [[René Guénon]] and the political concerns of the European [[Authoritarianism|Authoritarian]] Right.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011"/&gt; Evola's first published political work was an anti-fascist piece in 1925. In this work, Evola called Italy's fascist movement a "laughable revolution," based on empty sentiment and materialistic concerns. He applauded Mussolini's anti-bourgeois orientation and his goal of making Italian citizens into hardened warriors, but criticized Fascist populism, party politics, and elements of leftism that he saw in the fascist regime. Evola saw Mussolini's Fascist Party as possessing no cultural or spiritual foundation. He was passionate about infusing it with these elements in order to make it suitable for his ideal conception of ''Übermensch'' culture which, in Evola's view, characterized the imperial grandeur of pre-Christian Europe.&lt;ref name=occult/&gt; He expressed anti-nationalist sentiment, stating that to become "truly human," one would have to "overcome brotherly contamination" and "purge oneself" of the feeling that one is united with others "because of blood, affections, country or human destiny." He also opposed the [[futurism]] that Italian fascism was aligned with, along with the "plebeian" nature of the movement.&lt;ref name=gregor2006/&gt;{{rp|86}} Accordingly, Evola launched the journal ''La Torre'' (The Tower), to voice his concerns and advocate for a more elitist fascism.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002"/&gt; Evola's ideas were poorly received by the fascist mainstream as it stood at the time of his writing.&lt;ref name=Sedgwick/&gt;

===Mussolini===
[[File:Evola-40.jpg|thumb|Julius Evola (1940)]]
Scholars disagree about why [[Benito Mussolini]] embraced racist ideology in 1938—some scholars have written that Mussolini was more motivated by political considerations than ideology when he introduced anti-semitic legislation in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Renzo de Felice, ''Storia degli ebrei''; [[A. James Gregor]]; Meir Michaelis, ''Mussolini and the Jews''; ''contra'' Aaron Gillette, ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy'', Ch. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have rejected the argument that the racial ideology of Italian fascism could be attributed solely to Nazi influence.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Luigi Preti (1968) for discussion of [[miscegenation]]; Gene Bernardini (1977) for discussion of German influence&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent interpretation is that Mussolini was frustrated by the slow pace of fascist transformation and, by 1938, had adopted increasingly radical measures including a racial ideology. Aaron Gillette has written that "Racism would become the key driving force behind the creation of the new fascist man, the ''uomo fascista''."&lt;ref&gt;Gillette, ''Racial Theories'', p.51-53&lt;/ref&gt;

Mussolini read Evola's ''Synthesis of the Doctrine of Race'' in August 1941, and met with Evola to offer him his praise. Evola later recounted that Mussolini had found in his work a uniquely Roman form of Fascist [[racism]] distinct from that found in [[Nazi Germany]]. With Mussolini's backing, Evola launched the minor journal ''Sangue e Spirito'' (Blood and Spirit). While not always in agreement with German racial theorists, Evola traveled to Germany in February 1942 and obtained support for German collaboration on ''Sangue e Spirito'' from "key figures in the German racial hierarchy."&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002"/&gt; Fascists appreciated the [[Palingenetic ultranationalism|palingenetic]] value of Evola's "proof" "that the true representatives of the state and the culture of ancient Rome were people of the Nordic race."&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002"/&gt; Evola eventually became Italy's leading racial philosopher.&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt;

Evola blended [[Sorelianism]] with Mussolini's [[eugenics]] agenda. Evola has written that "The theory of the Aryo-Roman race and its corresponding myth could integrate the Roman idea proposed, in general, by fascism, as well as give a foundation to Mussolini's plan to use his state as a means to elevate the average Italian and to enucleate in him a new man."&lt;ref&gt;Gillette, ''Racial Theories'', p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, 1951, Evola was arrested and charged with promoting the revival of the Fascist Party, and of glorifying Fascism. Defending himself at trial, Evola stated that his work belonged to a long tradition of anti-democratic writers who certainly could be linked to fascism—at least fascism interpreted according to certain Evolian criteria—but who certainly could not be identified with the Fascist regime under Mussolini. Evola then declared that he was not a Fascist but a "superfascist". He was acquitted.&lt;ref name=Wolff&gt;Wolff, Elisabetta Cassini. "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0031322X.2016.1243662 Evola's interpretation of fascism and moral responsibility]", Patterns of Prejudice, Vol. 50, Issue 4–5, 2016. pp. 478–494&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third Reich===
Finding Italian fascism too compromising, Evola began to seek recognition in [[Nazi Germany]]. Evola spent a considerable amount of time in Germany in 1937 and 1938, and gave a series of lectures to the German–Italian Society in 1938.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002" /&gt; Evola took issue with Nazi populism and biological materialism. SS authorities initially rejected Evola's ideas as supranational and aristocratic though he was better received by members of the conservative revolutionary movement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Nazi [[Ahnenerbe]] reported that many considered his ideas to be pure "fantasy" which ignored "historical facts.".&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002"/&gt; Evola admired [[Heinrich Himmler]], whom he knew personally,&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002" /&gt; but he had reservations about [[Adolf Hitler]] because of Hitler's reliance on ''völkisch'' nationalism.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Himmler's [[Schutzstaffel]] ("SS") kept a dossier on Evola—dossier document AR-126 described his plans for a "Roman-Germanic Imperium" as "utopian" and described him as a "reactionary Roman," whose goal was an "insurrection of the old aristocracy against the modern world." The document recommended that the SS "stop his effectiveness in Germany" and provide him with no support, particularly because of his desire to create a "secret international order".&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.T. Hansen, "A Short Introduction to Julius Evola" in Evola, ''Revolt Against the Modern World'', p xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Umland&gt;A. James Gregor and Andreas Umland. ''Erwägen Wissen Ethik'', 15: 3 &amp; 4 (2004), pp. 424-429, 591-595; vol. 16: 4 (2005), pp. 566-572 ''[https://www.academia.edu/174269/Dugin_Not_a_Fascist_A_Debate_with_A._James_Gregor_6_texts_ Dugin Not a Fascist?]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this opposition, Evola was able to establish political connections with pan-Europeanist elements inside the [[Reich Main Security Office]].&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Evola subsequently ascended to the inner circles of Nazism as the influence of pan-European advocates overtook that of Völkisch proponents, due to military contingencies.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Evola wrote the article ''Reich and Imperium as Elements in the New European Order'' for the Nazi-backed journal ''European Review''.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; He spent World War II working for the [[Sicherheitsdienst]].&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; The Sicherheitsdienst bureau Amt VII, a [[Reich Main Security Office]] research library, helped Evola acquire arcane occult and Masonic texts.&lt;ref name=Rahn&gt;Nigel Graddon. ''Otto Rahn and the Quest for the Grail: The Amazing Life of the Real Indiana Jones''. SCB Distributors, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=forum/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;

Italian Fascism went into decline when, in 1943, Mussolini was deposed and imprisoned. At this point, Evola fled to Germany with the help of the Sicherheitsdienst.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Although not a member of the [[National Fascist Party]], and despite his apparent problems with the Fascist regime, Evola was one of the first people to greet Mussolini when the latter was broken out of prison by [[Otto Skorzeny]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Griffin, Matthew Feldman. ''Fascism: Post-war fascisms''. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004. p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Evola helped welcome Mussolini to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Wolf's Lair]].&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Following this, Evola involved himself in Mussolini's [[Italian Social Republic]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It was Evola's custom to walk around the city of [[Vienna]] during [[bombing raid]]s in order to better "ponder his destiny". During one such raid, 1945, a [[shell (projectile)|shell]] fragment damaged his [[spinal cord]] and he became [[paralysis|paralyzed]] from the waist down, remaining so for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=Guido&gt;Guido Stucco, "Translator's Introduction," in Evola, ''The Yoga of Power'', pp. ix–xv&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-War==
[[File:Julius Evola – Smernice (it. Orientamenti).jpg|thumb|Julius Evola – ''Směrnice'' (2015),  the Czech translation  of his book ''Orientamenti'' (1950).]]
After World War II, Evola continued his work in esotericism. He wrote a number of books and articles on sex magic and various other esoteric studies, including ''The Yoga of Power: Tantra, Shakti, and the Secret Way'' (1949), ''Eros and the Mysteries of Love: The Metaphysics of Sex'' (1958), and ''Meditations on the Peaks: Mountain Climbing as Metaphor for the Spiritual Quest'' (1974). He also wrote his two explicitly political books ''Men Among the Ruins: Post-War Reflections of a Radical Traditionalist'' (1953), ''Ride the Tiger: A Survival Manual for the Aristocrats of the Soul'' (1961), and his autobiography,&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; ''The Path of Cinnabar'' (1963). He also expanded upon critiques of American civilization and materialism, as well as increasing American influence in Europe, collected in the posthumous anthology ''Civiltà Americana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Civiltà americana. Scritti sugli Stati Uniti (1930–1968)|last=Evola|first=Julius|publisher=Controcorrente|year=2010|isbn=|location=Napoli|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evola's occult ontology exerted influence over post-war [[neo-fascism]].&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002" /&gt; In the post-war period, Evola's writing evoked interest among the neo-fascist right.&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; After 1945, Evola was considered the most important Italian theoretician of the conservative revolutionary movement&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; and the "chief ideologue" of Italy's post-war radical right.&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt; According to Egil Asprem and Kennet Granholm, Evola's most significant post-war political texts are ''Orientamenti'' and ''Men Among the Ruins''.&lt;ref&gt;Egil Asprem, Kennet Granholm. ''Contemporary Esotericism''. Routledge, 2014. p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

''Orientamenti'' was a text against "national fascism"—instead, it advocated for a European Community modeled on the principles of the [[Waffen-SS]].&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; The Italian Neo-fascist group [[Ordine Nuovo]] adopted ''Orientamenti'' as a guide for action in postwar Italy.&lt;ref name=Laurelle&gt;Marlene Laruelle. ''Eurasianism and the European Far Right: Reshaping the Europe–Russia Relationship''. Lexington Books, 2015. p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Liberation Front]], who were affiliated with [[Francis Parker Yockey]], called Evola "Italy's gretest living authoritarian philosopher" in the April 1951 issue of their publication ''Frontfighter''.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;

During the post-war period, Evola attempted to dissociate himself from totalitarianism, preferring the concept of the "organic" state, which he put forth in his text ''Men Among the Ruins''.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011"/&gt; Evola sought to develop a strategy for the implementation of a "conservative revolution" in post World War II Europe.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011"/&gt; He rejected nationalism, advocating instead for a European ''Imperium'', which could take various forms according to local conditions, but should be "organic, hierarchical, anti-democratic, and anti-individual."&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011"/&gt; Evola endorsed [[Francis Parker Yockey]]'s neo-fascist manifesto ''Imperium'', but disagreed with it because he believed that Yockey had a "superficial" understanding of what was immediately possible.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Evola believed that his conception of neo-fascist Europe could best be implemented by an elite of "superior" men who operated outside normal politics.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;

Giuliano Salierni was an activist in the neo-Fascist [[Italian Social Movement]] during the early 1950s. He later recalled Evola's calls to violence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Roberto Fiore]] and his colleagues in the early 1980s helped the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]]{{'}}s "Political Soldiers" forge a militant elitist philosophy based on Evola's "most militant tract", ''The Aryan Doctrine of Battle and Victory''. ''The Aryan Doctrine'' called for a "Great Holy War" that would be fought for spiritual renewal and fought in parallel to the physical "Little Holy War" against perceived enemies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Wolff attributes extreme-right terrorist actions in Italy in the 1970s and 1980s to the influence of Julius Evola.&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt;

Thomas Sheehan has argued that Evola's work is essential reading for those seeking to understand [[Neo-fascism|Eurofascism]], in the same way that knowledge of the writings of [[Karl Marx]] is necessary for those seeking to understand Communist actions.&lt;ref name=sheehanterror/&gt;

==Political influence==
The Italian Fascist leader [[Benito Mussolini]], the Nazi Grail seeker [[Otto Rahn]], and the Romanian fascist sympathizer and religious historian [[Mircea Eliade]] admired Julius Evola.&lt;ref name=HorowitzMussolini/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rahn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; After World War II, Evola's writings continued to influence many European far-right political, racist and neo-fascist movements. He is widely translated in French, Spanish, partly in German, and mostly in Hungarian (the largest number of his translated works [see &lt;http://www.tradicio.org/bibliographia.pdf&gt; pp.&amp;nbsp;130–154]). Amongst those he has influenced are the American Blackshirts Party, the "esoteric Hitlerist" [[Miguel Serrano]],&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; [[Savitri Devi]], [[GRECE]], the [[Italian Social Movement|Movimento sociale italiano]] (MSI), [[Gaston Armand Amaudruz]]'s [[New European Order|Nouvel Ordre Européen]], [[Pino Rauti]]'s [[Ordine Nuovo]], [[Troy Southgate]], [[Alain de Benoist]], [[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]], [[Giorgio Freda]], the [[Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari]] (Armed Revolutionary Nuclei), [[Eduard Limonov]], [[New Force (Italy)|Forza Nuova]], [[CasaPound|CasaPound Italia]], [[Tricolor Flame]] and the [[Conservative People's Party of Estonia]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} [[Giorgio Almirante]] referred to him as "our [[Herbert Marcuse|Marcuse]]&amp;mdash;only better."&lt;ref name=sheehanterror/&gt; According to one leader of the neofascist "black terrorist" [[Ordine Nuovo]], "Our work since 1953 has been to transpose Evola's teachings into direct political action."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ferraresi, Franco. "The Radical Right in Postwar Italy." ''Politics &amp; Society''. 1988 16:71-119. (p.84)&lt;/ref&gt; The now defunct French fascist group [[Third Way (France)|Troisième Voie]] was also inspired by Evola.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Race relations. "The far Right in Europe: a guide." ''Race &amp; Class'', 1991, Vol. 32, No. 3:125-146 (p.132).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Bowden]], English political activist and chairman of the [[Far-right politics in the United Kingdom|far right]], spoke highly of Evola and his ideas and gave lectures on his philosophy.

Evola has also influenced the [[alt-right]] movement,&lt;ref name=HorowitzMussolini/&gt; which also cites [[Oswald Spengler]], [[H. L. Mencken|H.L Mencken]], [[Samuel T. Francis|Sam Francis]], and [[Pat Buchanan]] as influences.&lt;ref name=Dershowitz/&gt; Additionally, Evola has influenced [[Vladimir Putin]] advisor&lt;ref name=Meyer&gt;Meyer, Henry and Ant, Onur.

'''''Laughing Boy with a Flute''''' is a painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Frans Hals]], painted in the early 1620s.

==Painting ==
This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1910, who wrote "31. A LAUGHING BOY WITH A FLUTE. M. 240. Half-length, in profile to the left. The head is three-quarters left. The long hair falls in disorder. The lips are parted, showing the teeth. On the left the flute is held upright in the right hand. The eyes look to the 
left and slightly upward. Lifelike colour in the face. Circular panel, n| inches across the grain of the wood running diagonally. A copy is in the [[Museum Boucher de Perthes|Boucher de Perthes Museum]], [[Abbeville]]. In the collection of the late [[Alfred Beit]], London. In the collection of [[Otto Beit]], London."&lt;ref&gt;* [https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn03hofsuoft#page/12/mode/1up Hofstede de Groot] on A Laughing Boy with a Flute; catalog number 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofstede de Groot noted several laughing boys by Hals along with this one (catalogue numbers 11 through to 39). This painting was also documented by [[W.R. Valentiner]] in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/franshalsdesmeis00valeuoft#page/34/mode/1up Laughing boy with Flute, number 34 right]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13''''' (published in [[paperback]] as '''''Apollo 13'''''), is a non-fiction book first published in 1994 by astronaut [[Jim Lovell|James Lovell]] and journalist [[Jeffrey Kluger]], about the failed April 1970 [[Apollo 13]] lunar landing mission which Lovell commanded. The book is the basis of the 1995 film adaptation ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', directed by [[Ron Howard]].

==Background==
Apollo 13 was the third mission of the [[Apollo program]] intended to land men on the Moon. An explosion of an onboard [[liquid oxygen]] tank in the Service Module, when the craft was close to reaching the Moon, crippled the electrical power generation and propulsion systems for the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module]] ''Odyssey''. This necessitated the abort of the lunar landing, and placed the lives of astronauts Lovell, [[Jack Swigert]], and [[Fred Haise]] in serious jeopardy. The mission became famous for the safe return of the men, made possible by the [[flight controller]]s' resourceful adaptation of the electrical, propulsion, and life support systems of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM (Lunar Module)]] ''Aquarius'' as a "lifeboat".

'''Louisa Anne Meredith''' (20 July 1812 – 21 October 1895), also known as '''Louisa Anne Twamley''', was an [[England|Anglo]]/Australian writer and illustrator.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;Sally O'Neill, '[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A050526b.htm Meredith, Louisa Ann (1812–1895)]', [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], Volume 5, Melbourne University Press, 1974, pp 239–240. Retrieved 7 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Louisa Anne Twamley was born in [[Birmingham]], England, the daughter of Thomas Twamley and Louisa Ann ''née'' Meredith.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; She was educated mainly by her mother, and in 1835 published a volume, ''Poems'', which was reviewed favourably. This was followed by ''The Romance of Nature'' (1836, third edition 1839), mostly in verse. Another volume was published in 1839,&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/b/OL14503127M/annual_of_British_landscape_scenery. ''The Annual of British Landscape Scenery''] at Open Library&lt;/ref&gt; subtitled ''An autumn ramble on the Wye'' an account of a tour on the [[River Wye]] from [[Chepstow]] to near its source at [[Plynlimon]].&lt;ref name=dab&gt;{{Dictionary of Australian Biography|First=Louisa Anne|Last=Meredith|shortlink=0-dict-biogMa-Mo.html#meredith2|accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 April 1839, she married her cousin, [[Charles Meredith (Tasmania)|Charles Meredith]] at Old Edgbaston Church, Birmingham.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Charles had emigrated to [[Van Diemen's Land]] (now [[Tasmania]]) in 1821 with his father George and family.  They had been pioneers of grazing, whaling and other activities around [[Swansea, Tasmania|Swansea]] on Tasmania's East Coast. Charles had become a squatter in the [[Canberra]] district of [[New South Wales]].

Meredith and her husband sailed for [[New South Wales]] in June 1839, and arrived at Sydney on 27 September 1839. After travelling into the interior as far as [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], Mrs Meredith returned to the coast and lived at [[Homebush]] for around a year.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt; By the time of his return to New South Wales, severe economic depression caused by excessive land speculation had destroyed the value of Charles' property, and towards the end of 1840 they relocated to [[Tasmania]].  An interesting account of her first 11 years in Australia is given in her two books, ''Notes and Sketches of New South Wales'' (1844), reprinted at least twice, and ''My Home in Tasmania'' (1852), which was soon republished in the United States under the title ''Nine Years in Australia''.

For most of her life Louisa Meredith lived on properties around Swansea. In 1860 she published ''Some of My Bush Friends in Tasmania'' which contained elaborate full-colour plates printed by the new [[chromolithography]] process. The illustrations were drawn by herself, and simple descriptions of characteristic native flowers were given. In 1861 an account of a visit to [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in 1856, ''Over the Straits'', was published, and in 1880 ''Tasmanian Friends and Foes, Feathered, Furred and Finned''. This went into a second edition in 1881. In 1891, Meredith went to London to supervise the publication of ''Last Series, Bush Friends in Tasmania''. Published at the beginning of a severe financial depression in the Australian colonies, this project and the collapse of the bank where most of her savings were held ruined her financially. In her final years Meredith suffered from chronic sciatica and became blind in one eye. She died in [[Collingwood, Victoria]] (a suburb of Melbourne) on 21 October 1895&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; and was survived by sons Owen and George.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

Meredith was the author of two novels, ''Phoebe's Mother'' (1869), which had appeared in the Melbourne weekly ''The Australasian'' in 1866 under the title of ''Ebba'', and ''Nellie, or Seeking Goodly Pearls'' (1882).

Meredith took great interest in politics, her husband Charles being a Member of the [[Tasmanian Legislative Council]] for several terms between the mid-1850s until just before his death in 1881.  She was an early member of the [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] and influenced her husband to legislate for preservation of native wildlife and scenery.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

Meredith often wrote unsigned articles for the Tasmanian press. This was no new thing for her as in her youth she had written articles in support of the [[Chartism|Chartists]]. When she visited Sydney in 1882, [[Henry Parkes|Sir Henry Parkes]] told her that he had read and appreciated her articles when a youth. After her husband's death she was granted a pension of £100 a year by the Tasmanian government.
Many of her books were illustrated by herself. Her volumes on New South Wales, Tasmania, and Victoria in the 1840s and 1850s, will always retain their historical significance.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

'''''Metamorphosis Symphonies''''' is the collective name for three [[symphony|symphonies]] by German composer, [[Martin Scherber]]. The first was composed before the outbreak of World War II in Nuremberg. After the war Scherber continued his musical path with the Second Symphony in F minor and the Third Symphony in B minor, which followed this directly. 

They grow only from one theme. This centralizes everything with its weaving metamorphoses and gives the symphonies a breathing rhythm. "There is not simply a horizontal 'exposition' in a single voice but the 'accompanying' instruments also take up motifs and their variants" all through the symphony, "resulting in a vertical density of internal relationships." &lt;ref&gt; Henning Kunze:  Booklet 3. Symphonie in h-moll durch Martin Scherber, p. 12, Peermusic Classical/col legno, Bad Wiessee, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; 

In this way Scherber develops an organic music in constant transformation. Like [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] he experienced within himself a continual metamorphosis of musical themes as result of his connection with forces of life. By discovering this he was able to change the methods of composing and gave new life to the symphony, including its formal aspects.

{{Citation style|date=January 2010}}

'''Micrography''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]], literally small-writing – "Μικρογραφία"), also called '''microcalligraphy''', is a [[Jew]]ish form of [[calligram]]s developed in the 9th century, with parallels in Christianity and Islam,&lt;ref&gt;[http://expositions.bnf.fr/parole/grand/134.htm Torah, Bible, Coran] (French)&lt;/ref&gt; utilizing minute [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letters]] to form representational, geometric and abstract designs. Colored micrography is especially distinctive because these rare artworks are customarily rendered in black and white.

== Description ==
The artwork is created from text that forms an image when viewed at a distance, creating an interplay between the text and image. The [[photomosaic]], whose tiny individual images form a mosaic when viewed from a distance, is a modern analogue.

== Motivation ==
{{see also|Calligram}}
[[File:Caligrafia arabe pajaro.jpg|thumb|An Arabic [[calligram]] in the form of a peacock.]]
There is a relationship between this form of art, employing both digital and analogic symbols, and the restrictions on images found in the [[Ten commandments#Traditional division and interpretation|second commandment]]. Micrography provides a unique solution to the visual artist who wishes to remain devout in observation of [[Jewish law]], by using only text, not images per se. As similar restrictions exist in certain [[Islam|Muslim]] societies, this solution has been adapted in [[Islamic calligraphy]] to the [[Arabic alphabet]] as well.

'''Museumsufer''' is the name of a landscape of museums in [[Frankfurt]], [[Hesse]], Germany, lined up on both banks of the river [[Main (river)|Main]] or in close vicinity. The centre is the historic art museum [[Städel]]. The other museums were added, partly by transforming historic villas, partly by building new museums, in the 1980s by cultural politician [[Hilmar Hoffmann]].

== History ==
The idea for a group of different museums in Frankfurt was proposed in 1977 by [[Hilmar Hoffmann]], who was then as  ''Kulturdezernent'' responsible for culture in the city.&lt;ref&gt;''Frankfurter Wochenschau'' of 1 February 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Before, architect {{ill|Till Behrens|de}} had proposed a concept {{ill|Frankfurter Grüngürtel|de}} to the forum for development (''Frankfurter Forum für Stadtentwicklung''). Between 1980 and 1990, existing museums were expanded and many new ones built, often including historic villas.&lt;ref name="Breidecker" /&gt; Architects included internationally known [[Richard Meier]], [[Oswald Mathias Ungers]], [[Josef Paul Kleihues]], [[Günter Behnisch]] and [[Hans Hollein]].&lt;ref name="Dornberg" /&gt;

Beginning in 2008, Frankfurt has restored and expanded some of it museums.g The [[Städel]] was expanded by an annex, and the [[Deutsches Filminstitut|Fil Museum]] was renovated.

== South bank ==
* {{ill|Icon Museum|de|Ikonen-Museum (Frankfurt am Main)}}, housing one of the largest collections of Russian, Bulgarian, Greek and other [[icon]]s in Germany
* [[Museum Angewandte Kunst]] (Museum Applied Arts), housing furniture and design from the 10th to 21st century with a notable collection of East Asian applied arts
* [[Museum der Weltkulturen]] (Ethnological Museum), displaying a small part of an ethnological collection in changing exhibitions.
* {{ill|Deutsches Filmmuseum|de}} (German Film Museum), explaining the development of movie-making from the beginnings in the 19th century up until today, includes an art house cinema
* [[German Architecture Museum]] (''Deutsches Architekturmuseum''), apart from a small permanent collection, changing exhibitions showcase current architectural projects and trends from around the globe.
* [[Museum für Kommunikation Frankfurt|Museum für Kommunikation]] (Communication Museum). The large permanent collection displays various relics from the postal and telephone services, including one of the world's largest stamp collections and a collection of communication related art; temporary exhibitions focus more on the abstract phenomenon of communication.
* [[Städel]], one of Germany's prominent fine art museums&lt;ref name="Dornberg" /&gt; with a focus on old masters and classical modern art
* [[Liebieghaus]], a sculpture collection, focusing mainly on sculpture from ancient Greece until the renaissance days
* [[Museum Giersch]], showcasing a small permanent collection of local 19th-century artists and houses temporary exhibition on artists that have a (loose) connection to the Frankfurt region
* [[Portikus]], a small free exhibition space showing temporary exhibitions of contemporary art

The exhibition hall [[Portikus]] was opened on an island at the [[Alte Brücke (Frankfurt)|Alte Brücke]] in 2006. 

The street on the south is called [[Schaumainkai]] and is often partially closed to traffic for Frankfurt's largest [[flea market]] each Saturday. Two festivals focus on the Museumsufer, the "Nacht der Museen" when several museums open at night, and the "Museumsuferfest" in August.&lt;ref name="Frankfurt" /&gt;

'''Music on hold''' ('''MOH''') is the business practice of playing recorded [[music]] to fill the silence that would be heard by [[telephone]] callers who have been placed [[Hold (telephone)|on hold]].  It is especially common in situations involving [[customer service]].

Music on hold is sometimes referred to as phone on hold, message on hold, on hold messaging, or hold music.

==Development==
Music on hold was created by Alfred Levy, an inventor, factory owner, and entrepreneur. In 1962, Levy discovered a problem with the phone lines at his factory. He discovered that a loose wire was touching a metal girder on the building. This made the building a giant receiver so that the audio broadcast signal from a radio station next door would transmit through the loose wire and could be heard when calls were put on hold.&lt;ref&gt;Article{{cite web|url=http://callsonhold.com/recognition.htm|title=Smithsonian recognizes Music on Hold. |publisher=CallsonHold.com |date=2005-01-01 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levy patented his work in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=PZ9lAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Google Patent for Telephone Hold Program System  |publisher=google.com/patents |date=2013-07-06 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; While other advancements have come to change and enhance the technology, it was this initial patent creation that began the evolution for today's music on hold.

==Equipment and formats==
Most MOH systems are integrated into a telephone system designed for businesses via an [[jack (connector)|audio jack]] on the [[telephone]] equipment labeled "MOH". There are also some units with built-in message on hold capabilities and units designed for small businesses without an extensive phone system.

Today, equipment that supports physical media usually plays [[Compact disk|CDs]]. Some older systems may still use [[Compact audio cassette|cassette tapes]] (sometimes employing endless-loops), or [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] tape players. In each case, the unit loads the media into a digital memory chip to prevent premature wearing of the mechanical parts.

Equipment that supports virtual media generally plays [[MP3]] files. Several types of units play these files. [[USB Flash Drive]] units allow an MP3 file to be received electronically, downloaded to a flash drive and connected to the player. Ethernet based remote load units connect via the network to a remote IP address. Phone line based remote load systems allow for a connection via an analog telephone line and dialing the number belonging to the unit.  For [[Voice over internet protocol|VoIP]] phone systems, MP3s are loaded without any equipment.

Newer technology allows MP3 files to be downloaded automatically from the internet so that messages (or interesting content in the form of news and weather, amongst many) can be changed daily. The new "online on hold" technology makes the older technology redundant since it requires no additional hardware.  All these systems allow analog-to-digital audio storage and playback.

As of 2011 allow productions to be downloaded via the Internet or played through a USB flash drive. This allows for larger files and higher quality formats. Grace Digital manufactures internet radio devices that play streaming content (see Recent Trends, below).

==Consumer perceptions==
A number of studies have been conducted, which highlight consumer perceptions of music on hold, reinforcing its use by businesses to improve standards of call handling.

A survey of more than 2,000 UK consumers commissioned by audio branding specialist [[PHMG (company)]] revealed 70% of consumers are put on hold for more than 50% of their calls. When put on hold, 73% of callers want to hear something other than beeps or silence.&lt;ref&gt;Article{{cite web|url=http://www.freshbusinessthinking.com/news.php?NID=14476&amp;Title=Seventy+per+cent+of+consumers+put+on+hold+for+longer+than+a+minute |title=Seventy per cent of consumers put on hold for longer than a minute |publisher=freshbusinessthinking.com |date=2012-06-30 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article{{cite web|url=http://www.smallbusiness.co.uk/channels/sales-and-marketing/news/2110543/customers-perennially-on-hold.thtml |title=Customers perennially on hold |publisher=smallbusiness.co.uk |date=2012-06-29 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CNN survey found that 70 percent of callers in the United States who hold the line in silence hang up within 60 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://work.chron.com/importance-onhold-messages-4665.html |title=The Importance of On-Hold Messages |author=Anna Assad |publisher=Houston Chronicle |accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, research by North American Telecom found callers hearing music on hold will stay on the line 30 seconds longer than callers experiencing silence.

==Source of music==

===Radio===
The musical source may be as simple as playing a local [[radio station]] through the MOH jack.  This is unlawful without the express permission of the music title and mechanical copyright holders.
* Although radio stations may provide the desired [[List of music radio formats|musical format]], there is no control over the specific songs that are played, some of which may be offensive to the callers, or depending on the music played, sound harsh in [[monaural]] sound. This kind of system is also vulnerable to interference.
* Radio stations typically do not [[license]] their music for MOH systems.  In the United States, the radio broadcaster has no legal right to provide such a license as they, themselves, obtain a usage license from the music title owner for the right to broadcast said music for limited and personal use.  As mentioned below, re-broadcasting of a radio program over a phone system may likely cause licensing and [[copyright]] problems for the owner of the MOH system.
* Most radio stations (excluding those that are part of [[non-commercial educational]] radio networks) will play [[advertising|commercials]], which may be offensive or at least annoying to the caller.  Furthermore, it is possible that a [[competition|competitor's]] commercial may be played, which would be counter-productive.

:See ''[[#Legal aspects|Legal aspects]]''.

Owners of radio stations will usually air their broadcast signal as music on hold, using their main program signal, if there are several.  Examples include [[RÚV]] from [[Iceland]] using [[Rás 1]] as the on-hold music.

===Off-the-shelf commercial CDs===
{{main article|Commercial off-the-shelf}}

Commercial CDs eliminate the problems encountered with radio commercials, and they offer control over the selection of music; they do not, however, grant proper license for MOH use unless users first obtain permission from the song title copyright owner (when the song is not in the "public domain") and the mechanical copyright owner. (See "Radio," above, for more details.)

===Stock MOH CDs (with or without voice-overs)===
CDs are available that have been specifically recorded and licensed for MOH systems.  These may contain only music, or may include periodic [[voice-over]]s with messages such as "Your call is important" or "Please stay on the line".  Such off-the-shelf recordings may be generic or may be specific to individual industries, but will not be customized for individual companies.

===Custom-designed MOH===
In general, custom music on hold is advised to:
#Control content
#Control music genre
#Use the on hold time to sell to a captive audience
#Through a reputable on hold company be fully licensed and legal for on hold playback
#Reduce hang-ups and make the business look more professional
#Control length of programming based on average caller holdtime

CDs (or other MOH formats, such as MP3 files) can be custom-created to suit the particular needs of a business.  The announcements can be scripted to emphasize particular attributes of the business such as location, store hours, or special promotions or services. These are typically used for up-selling and cross-selling callers. Companies can either record the messages themselves, or hire a music on hold production company.

===Online on hold===
A program loaded onto an existing computer and connected to the phone system can allow automatic content updates interspersed with company information.

===Streaming MOH===
Streaming MOH refers to a live music on hold stream (URL-based delivery) which can also include custom content. Streams in http .mp3 format include those provided by easyonhold.com. Streaming MOH can also refer to a streaming media server, as with Cisco Unified Call Manager, in which case RTP format is utilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cisco Unified Communications SRND Based on Cisco Unified CallManager 4.x - Music on Hold  [Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CallManager)] - Cisco Systems|url = http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/srnd/4x/42moh.html#wp1043752|website = www.cisco.com|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free on-hold programs===
Programs available to non-profit organizations at no cost. Very few companies offer absolutely free programs. The programs are available in generic and custom formats, and are delivered at no cost to the requesting organization.

==Styles of music==
The style of music played by MOH systems depends largely on the type of business offering the service.  It is generally best to present music that will not be offensive to the audience, but that would also be of particular interest to the typical caller. A western apparel store may choose to play [[country music]]. A Christian book store may choose to play popular [[Christian music]]. A university may choose to play [[European classical music|classical music]]. An athletic ticket office may choose to play the team or school's [[fight song]]. Light classics, [[smooth jazz]], and [[beautiful music]] are common choices, as is fully [[synthesizer|synthesized]] melodic music.

The most common MOH is "Opus Number One", which is on "65 million Cisco phone sets worldwide as the default hold music," according to a ''This American Life'' podcast (number 516). The composer, Tim Carleton, recorded the song in 1989 on a four-track tape recorder with Darrick Deel. When Deel, who works at Cisco, told Carleton their song could be the default music on hold, Carleton also approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glass|first=Ira|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/516/stuck-in-the-middle|publisher=This American Life|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent trends==
With the application of newer equipment, music on hold devices can now interact with the caller. No additional programs are required on the platform, as all the logic is done with the MoH device. This can include services such as 'polling on hold', rating your customer service officer anonymously, etc. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The trend toward hosted IP telephony for business phone systems is demanding changes in music on hold message technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wheeler|first=Tom|title=The IP Transition: Starting Now|journal=FCC Blog|date=November 19, 2013|pages=1|url=http://www.fcc.gov/blog/ip-transition-starting-now}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, 2013, EasyOnHold.com introduced custom messages on hold streams for use with [[Asterisk (PBX)|Asterisk]] and OnSIP phone systems.

==Legal aspects==

===Copyright law===
In the US, and other countries where [[copyright law]]s are practiced, authors are granted copyright protection on their musical compositions. Such copyright protection has existed since just after the turn of the 20th century and most music written prior to 1900-1910 - from impressionism back to baroque and antiquity are said to be  "in the [[public domain]]." Use of any said music prior to the creation of these copyright laws may be presumed to be free for use by all - although individual titles may have been later copyrighted through a change in the composition or arrangement. The use of copyrighted music is not for free use in the public domain.

All music written after this period, which is copyrighted under multiple acts of congress, are owned by the author(s) or their assignees.  The use of this music is protected and controlled in order that the owner may derive usage income. Specific to telephonic MOH (music-on-hold), the US laws currently protect the copyright owners from unlawful, unpermitted use of their music titles in over-the-phone broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soundcommunication.holdcom.com/bid/96828/Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-Music-Licensing |title=Everything You Need To Know About Music Licensing |author=J. Durante |publisher=Sound Communication}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any person or business wishing to use current, popular, post 1900-1910, copyrighted music for MOH purposes may only lawfully do so by obtaining permission from the owner.  Currently, performance rights societies such as ASCAP, BMI and SESAC will sell blanket permission to use music titles in their catalog for MOH purposes—for an express annual fee - calculated by size and frequency of usage. Failure to obtain this paid permission is a violation of US copyright laws.

This same copyright protection is also true in the rebroadcast of any radio program. As mentioned earlier, the broadcaster has been assigned a narrow and specific usage license to air copyrighted song titles. This does not include permission to any person or business to re-broadcast that program on telephonic MOH. The broadcaster may not promote such unlawful use and is not an owner who has any lawful right to grant MOH usage permission. They do not hold the ownership of the title and have no right to license use in any way. Those who plug radio broadcast into their telephone MOH without first obtaining paid permission through the owner's agents (ASCAP, BMI or SESAC) may be in violation of copyright law and may be prosecuted under existing federal laws.

===Mechanical copyright===
A second copyright exists when it comes to licensing use for telephonic MOH. A piece of music, as mentioned above, is copyrighted and may be licensed for use as a music title and is understood to be a combination of melody, harmony and, where applicable, lyrics.  However, neither radio listeners nor MOH listeners could hear this music unless it was recorded - providing a delivery medium whereby the "music" becomes a "performance."  As mentioned elsewhere, in countries such as the US, where said copyright laws are enforced, nearly every recording of a song title holds its own "mechanical copyright."

For most of the 20th century, music was recorded in studios, produced by record company executives, producers, arrangers and engineers who were hired to deliver the artist's finished recordings for mastering and duplication - for sale on the varied media: 78, 45 and 33 RPM vinyl, reel-to-reel, 8-track tape, cassette and [[compact disc]].  To protect their investment, the record companies obtain a mechanical copyright in order to protect and control the recording with which they derive usage and sales income.  (For those still uncertain of the difference between "song title" and "mechanical" copyrights,  consider the Capitol Records lawsuit for copyright infringement against Nike some 20 years ago.  Nike legally obtained permission to use the Beatles song title "Revolution" from the title's owner, Michael Jackson. They used the Capitol Records owned recording of the Beatles' performance, but failed to obtain and pay for permission and use.  Capitol Records sued and prevailed because Nike ONLY had a license to use the title and did not have a license to use the mechanical recording.)

Therefore, persons or businesses wishing to play music that falls "in the public domain" are still legally required to obtain permission to use the mechanical recording of this music, from the mechanical copyright holder.'''  '''And where the use is of copyrighted music, the same applies.  In all cases, before a song title may be broadcast on a telephone MOH, said use must be approved and licensed from BOTH the "song title" copyright owner (if it is NOT in public domain) and the "mechanical" copyright owner. '''

===Enforcement===
It is generally known within the on-hold industry that some performance rights societies, with regional offices and staff, both monitor and prosecute persons and businesses that infringe on the copyright of title holders in their libraries. [[ASCAP]] and [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] are both aggressive about this, from time to time. It is not known whether any record companies are currently or actively monitoring and prosecuting violators of their mechanical license.

[[File:Nathdwara srinathji.jpg|thumb|Nathdwara Srinathji|126x126px]]

'''Nathdwara Painting''' refers to a painting tradition and school of artists that emerged in [[Nathdwara]], a town in [[Rajsamand]] district in the Western state of [[Rajasthan]] in India. Nathdwara paintings are of different sub-styles of which ''[[Pichhwai]]'' paintings are the most popular.&lt;ref name=et02&gt;{{cite news|title=Temple of Doodh|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2002-08-15/news/27361138_1_temple-management-kar-seva-nathdwara|accessdate=14 January 2012|newspaper=''[[The Economic Times|Economic Times]]''|date=15 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ''Pichwai'' derives from the [[Sanskrit]] words ''pich'' meaning back and ''wais'' meaning hanging. These paintings are cloth paintings hung behind the image of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Shrinathji]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt; http://artofpast.com/gallery/pichwai-of-gopies/ &lt;/ref&gt; Link is dead --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Origin and area==
The Nathdwara school is a subset of the [[Mewar]] school of painting and is seen as an important school in the 17th and 18th century [[Manuscript miniature|miniature paintings]]. The sub-styles of Mewar painting include Udaigarh, Devgarh and Nathdwara as important centers of miniature production. The temple of Shrinathji is believed to have provided a boost to the art activities in the town. It is recorded that to avoid the oppression of the [[Iconoclasm|iconoclast]] [[Mughal emperor]] [[Aurangzeb]], the image of Shrinathji, a child manifestation of [[Krishna]] was installed in Nathdwara in 1670 by Goswami priests from [[Mathura]]. After this, many artists, including the famous Acharya Gopinathji, motivated by religious fervor came and created paintings of Srinathji.&lt;ref name=toi08&gt;{{cite news|title=Celebrating Nathdwara paintings|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-11-30/ahmedabad/27892936_1_mughal-sect-aurangzeb|accessdate=14 January 2012|newspaper=''[[Times of India]]''|date=30 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pichhwai are intricate paintings which portray Lord Krishna. They exist in the holy town of Nathdwara in the Rajasthan state of India.

Krishna is shown in different moods, body postures, and attire more commonly found on a cloth or paper. It is a very ancient form of art passed on from generation to generation and it has a very devotional theme towards Lord Krishna.

The purpose of Pichhwais, other than its artistic appeal, is to narrate tales of Krishna to the illiterate. They have become the main export of Nathdwara and are in much demand among foreign visitors in the area.

These artists mostly live in Chitron ki gali (Street of paintings) and Chitrakaron ka mohallah (colony of painters) and make a close community with constant interaction. It is no wonder that many times a Pichhwai painting is a group effort, where several skillful painters work together under the supervision of a master artist.

==Themes==
[[File:Sri nathji.jpg|thumb|103x103px|Srinathji.]]
Most works produced in this style revolve around the figure of Shrinathji as a manifestation of [[Krishna]] and refer to the incident of him holding the [[Govardhan hill]] on his last finger. Each ''pichwai'' painting is considered a ''seva'' or an offering to the deity and hence personifies Shrinathji as a prince with jewels and luxuries, surrounded by the milkmaids, [[gopi]]s. These ''seva'' themes are based on different seasons and paintings are made to depict different moods of the season.&lt;ref name="workworship"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2005/08/21/stories/2005082100170200.htm |title=Work is worship |last=Kapur|first=Mita|date=21 August 2005|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also paintings that show the Lord in different costumes celebrating different festivals. Other themes like Mata Yashoda, Nandlal and Balgopal figures are also painted in this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PGjTjmL29VIC | title=Splendour of Rajasthani Painting | first1=Jai Singh | last1=Neeraj | first2=Jayasiṃha | last2=Nīraja | publisher=Abhinav Publications | year=1991 | isbn=9788170172673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the paintings are gem-encrusted.&lt;ref name="ht10"&gt;{{cite news |title=Weaving art with charity|url=http://www.livemint.com/2010/08/20182353/Weaving-art-with-charity.html |newspaper=''[[Hindustan Times]]''|date=20 August 2010|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ File:Giorgione - Sleeping Venus - Google Art Project 2.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|Giorgione's ''[[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|Sleeping Venus]]'' (c. 1510), Dresden, [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]].]]
In [[art history]], "'''Old Master'''" (or "'''old master'''")&lt;ref&gt;The term is spelled either way in the literature. Major UK and US dictionaries, incl. the [https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/old_master Oxford Online Dictionaries], [https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=old%20master American Heritage Dictionary], Macmillan, Cambridge, and Random House dictionaries use lowercase; Oxford English Dictionary, Collins, and Merriam-Webster dictionaries also mention the uppercase spelling.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=christies1&gt;[http://www.christies.com/departments/old-master-and-early-british-paintings-70-1.aspx Old Masters Department], Christies.com.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to any [[painting|painter]] of skill who worked in Europe before about 1800, or a painting by such an artist. An "[[old master print]]" is an original [[printmaking|print]] (for example an [[engraving]] or [[etching]]) made by an artist in the same period. The term "old master [[drawing]]" is used in the same way.

In theory, "Old Master" applies only to artists who were fully trained, were [[Master craftsman|Master]]s of their local [[Guild of Saint Luke|artists' guild]], and worked independently, but in practice, paintings produced by pupils or workshops are often included in the scope of the term. Therefore, beyond a certain level of competence, date rather than quality is the criterion for using the term.

==Period covered==
In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the term was often understood as having a starting date of perhaps 1450 or 1470; paintings made before that were "primitives", but this distinction is no longer made. The  ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''  defines the term as "A pre-eminent artist of the period before the modern; esp. a pre-eminent western European painter of the 13th to 18th centuries." The first quotation given is from 1696, in the diary of [[John Evelyn]]: "My L: Pembroke..shewed me divers rare Pictures of very many of the old &amp; best Masters, especially that of M: Angelo..,&amp; a large booke of the best drawings of the old Masters."&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;"old master, n. and adj." ''OED Online''. Oxford University Press, December 2016. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to refer to a painting or sculpture made by an Old Master, a usage datable to 1824.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; There are comparable terms in Dutch, French and German; the Dutch may have been the first to make use of such a term, in the 18th century, when ''oude meester'' mostly meant [[Dutch Golden Age painting|painters of the Dutch Golden Age]] of the previous century. ''Les Maitres d'autrefois'' of 1876 by [[Eugene Fromentin]] may have helped to popularize the concept, although "vieux maitres" is also used in French. The famous collection in [[Dresden]] at the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]] is one of the few museums to include the term in its actual name, although many more use it in the title of departments or sections. The collection in the Dresden museum essentially stops at the [[Baroque]] period.

The end date is necessarily vague – for example, [[Goya]] (1746–1828) is certainly an Old Master,&lt;ref name=christies1 /&gt; though he was still painting and [[printmaking]] at his death in 1828. The term might also be used for [[John Constable]]&lt;ref name=christies1 /&gt; (1776–1837) or [[Eugène Delacroix]] (1798–1868), but usually is not.

The term tends to be avoided by [[art historian]]s as too vague, especially when discussing paintings, although the terms "Old Master Prints" and "Old Master drawings" are still used. It remains current in the art trade. Auction houses still usually divide their sales between, for example, "Old Master Paintings", "Nineteenth-century paintings" and "Modern paintings". [[Christie's]] defines the term as ranging "from the 14th to the early 19th century".{{cite quote|date=January 2017}}

==Anonymous artists==
Artists, most often from early periods, whose hand has been identified by art historians, but to whom no identity can be confidently attached, are often given names by art historians such as ''[[Master E.S.]]'' (from his monogram), ''[[Master of Flémalle]]'' (from a previous location of a work), ''Master of [[Mary of Burgundy]]'' (from a patron), ''[[Master of Latin 757]]'' (from the shelf mark of a manuscript he illuminated), ''[[Master of the Brunswick Diptych]]'' or ''[[Master of Schloss Lichtenstein]]''.

{{Main article|Sindhi folklore}}
'''Sindhi folklore''' ({{lang-sd|'''  لوڪ ادب'''}}) is the [[folklore|folk]] tradition which has developed in Sindh over a number of centuries.Sindh abounds with folklore, in all forms, and colors from such obvious manifestations as the traditional [[Watayo Faqir]] tales, the legend of ''Moriro'', epic tale of [[Dodo Soomro|Dodo Chanesar]], to the heroic character of [[Marui]] which distinguishes it among the contemporary folklores of the region. The love story of [[Sassui Punhun|Sassui]], who pines for her lover Punhu, is known and sung in every Sindhi settlement.  Other examples of the folklore of Sindh include the stories of Umar Marui and Suhuni Mehar.&lt;ref&gt;Kalyan Adwani, ed. ''[[Shah Jo Risalo]]''. [[Jamshoro]]: Sindhi Adabi Board, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Sindhi folk Singers and women play a vital role to transmit the Sindhi folklore. They sang the [[Sindhi folk tales|folktales of Sindh]] in songs with passion in every village of Sindh.

Sindhi folklore has been compiled in  a series of forty volumes under [[Sindhi Adabi Board]]'s project of '''Folklore and Literature'''.This valuable project was accomplished by noted sindhi scholar [[Nabi Bux Khan Baloch|Dr.Nabi Bux Baloch]].The material for the project has been collected both from the oral traditions village folks and the written record. This folklore series deals with diverse segments Sindhi folklore and literature i.e. Fables and Fairy-tales, pseudo-historical Romances, Folk-poetry, Folk songs, Proverbs, Riddles etc.

=== Balochi folklore ===
[[Balochi language|Balochi]] folklore is alive with the love stories of [[Hani and Sheh Mureed|Hani and Shah Murad Chakar]], [[Shahdad and Mahnaz]], [[Lallah and Granaz]], [[Bebarg and Granaz]], and [[Mast and Sammo]], among others. The war tales of the [[Baloch people|Baloch]] are equally stirring. The ''[[chap (dance)|chap]]'', a [[Baloch people|Baloch]] style of dancing, has a curious rhythm distinguished by an inertial back sway with every forward step. Baloch music has a unique flavour of its own.

=== Kashmiri folklore ===
[[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] regions in the north are equally rich in folklore.

=== Pakhtun folklore ===
In the [[Pukhtun]] areas of the northwest, the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North-West Frontier Province]] is the home of energetic warlike dancers, the most prominent being the Khattak dance, which bears the name of the tribe that dances it.

{{Main article|Punjabi folklore}}
Many folk tales from [[Punjab region|Punjab]] have been disseminated worldwide by the [[Punjabi diaspora]], especially in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and United States. The tale of two lovers, [[Heer Ranjha|Heer]] and Ranjha, is based in the [[Pakistan]]i part of the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], in a city called [[Jhang]]. Today it is celebrated in songs, movies, theatre, and quotations. One may call a romantic person a Ranjha, meaning he is a devoted lover. Similarly a girl in love may be called "Heer." Apart from the epic of Hir and Ranjha, the Punjab has a rich tradition of ballads, folk tales, folk music and dance. The folklore of the Potohar Plateau of the north shows a local variant, while the lush green irrigated agriculture of the central plains is home to more sophisticated forms of folklore.

'''''Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatiques''''' (''Colored Landscape with Aquatic Birds'') is an oil painting created circa 1907 by the French artist and theorist [[Jean Metzinger]]. ''Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatiques'' is a [[Proto-Cubism|Proto-Cubist]] work executed in a [[Divisionism|Post-Divisionist]] style with a unique [[Fauvism|Fauve]]-like palette. Metzinger's broad omnidirectional brushstrokes in the treatment of surfaces render homage to [[Paul Cézanne]], while the luscious subtropical imagery in the painting are an homage to [[Paul Gauguin]] and Metzinger's friend [[Henri Rousseau]].

''Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatiques'' is located at the [[Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mam.paris.fr/en/online-collections#/artwork/180000000001284 Jean Metzinger, ''Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatiques'', Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatiques'' is an oil painting on canvas in a horizontal format with dimensions 75.5 x 101&amp;nbsp;cm (29.7 by 39.8 in). The work represents three aquatic birds in an ambrosial Mediterranean landscape with semi-tropical vegetation, trees, a body of water, mountains and a sailboat in the background. The free and expressive brushstrokes of ''Paysage coloré aux oiseaux aquatiques''—as in ''Les Ibis'' and ''Le Flamant rose et le voilier'' of the same period—represent a loosening of the mosaic-like [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] technique that characterized Metzinger's work from 1905 to early 1907.&lt;ref name="Joann Moser"&gt;Joann Moser, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Pre-Cubist works, 1904–1909'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, 1985, pp. 34-42&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1907 a select group of avant-garde artists in Paris were reevaluating their own work in relation to that of [[Paul Cézanne]]. A retrospective of Cézanne's paintings had been held at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1904. Current works were displayed at the 1905 and 1906 Salon d'Automne, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907. Metzinger's interest in the work of Cézanne suggests a means by which he made the transformation from Divisionism to Cubism.&lt;ref name="Joann Moser" /&gt;

The lattices of squares or 'cubes' of paint employed throughout his Divisionist period have not been entirely abandoned, but pushed to another extreme. Where before brushstrokes had become increasingly larger and organized into groups of color, now they were larger still and elongated, seemingly blended together directly on the canvas (rather than on a palette). The treatment of color and composition is globally free, loose, expressive, and thus dynamic. There are no inert tones. Colors have retained their brilliance. As before, contrasting hues are placed side by side—resulting in rhythmic and optic vibrational effects.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann"&gt;[http://jean-metzinger.blogspot.com.es/ Jean Metzinger: Divisionism, Cubism, Neoclassicism and Post-Cubism]&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines and large strokes of color, like words, are treated autonomously—each possessing an abstract value independent of one another, yet together forming a coherent whole. The impulse toward abstraction becomes a primary quality of Metzinger's work of 1907. Though not without reference to the real world, Metzinger's treatment of the painted surface is meant to draw away from the outward appearance of nature. Imitation is vacated in order to concentrate upon the distillation of essential shapes and movements. These distilled forms were superior to nature because they partook of idea, and represented the dominance of the artist over the mere stuff of nature.&lt;ref name="Robbins 1985"&gt;Daniel Robbins, ''Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', 1985, in ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt;

Complex in both composition and the rendering of color, the subject matter of ''Paysage coloré'', though clearly readable, is to a certain extent faceted and denaturalized. Its combination of painterly techniques, color and exoticism in its subject matter, sets it apart, resulting in a broader scope typically employed to define the Fauve movement.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

The spatial relationships between forms in the foreground and structures in the background are ambiguously flattened. Metzinger had already abandoned classical perspective for the most part since 1903, and now it had become entirely irrelevant.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

This composition was not only different from [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Georges Seurat]],  [[Henri-Edmond Cross]], [[Paul Sérusier]], [[Maurice Denis]] and [[Odilon Redon]] and the other [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionists]], [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolists]] and [[Nabis]], but different from [[Henri Matisse]], [[André Derain]], [[Othon Friesz]] and the other [[Fauvism|Fauves]]. Indeed, Metzinger, unlike others of his immediate circle, or peripheral entourage, would soon become one of the founders of Cubism—flanked between [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]] on the one hand, [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Fernand Léger]] on the other—and this painting was a step in that direction.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

Note: in ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect'' (1985), the title, dimensions and provenance for this painting, n. 19 of the catalogue, are erroneously switched with n. 18, ''Le Flamant rose et le voilier'', (pages 40 and 41).&lt;ref name="Joann Moser" /&gt;

[[File:Philopappos monument.jpg|thumb|250px|A close-up view of the Philopappu Monument]]
'''The Philopappu Monument''' ({{lang-el|Μνημείο Φιλοπάππου}}) is an [[ancient Greek]] [[mausoleum]] and [[monument]] dedicated to ''Gaius Julius Antiochus Epiphanes [[Philopappos]]'' or ''Philopappus'', ({{lang-el|Γάιος Ιούλιος Αντίοχος Επιφανής Φιλόπαππος}}, 65–116 AD), a prince from the [[Kingdom of Commagene]]. It is located on Mouseion Hill in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], southwest of the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]].

== Origins ==
Philopappos died in 116, and his death caused great grief to his sister [[Julia Balbilla]], citizens of Athens and possibly to the imperial family. As a dedication to honor the memory of Philopappos, Balbilla with the citizens of Athens erected a tomb structure on [[Muse]] '''Hill''' (Lofos Muson) near the [[Acropolis of Athens]]. His marble tomb monument is still known as the Philopappu Monument, and the hill is today known as '''Philopappu Hill''' (Λόφος Φιλοπάππου). 

The Greek geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (''Description of Greece'', I.25.8), describes Philopappos’ grand tomb as a ''monument built for a Syrian man''. The monument was built on the same site where Musaios or [[Musaeus of Athens|Musaeus]], a 6th-century BC priestly poet and mystical seer, was held to have been buried. The location of this tomb, opposite the Acropolis and within formal boundaries of the city, shows the high position Philopappos had within Athenian society.

== Description ==
Philopappos’ monument is a two-storey structure, supported by a base. On the lower level there is a frieze representing Philopappos as a [[Roman consul|consul]], riding on a chariot and led by [[lictor]]s. The upper level shows statues of three men: of [[Antiochus IV of Commagene|Antiochus IV]] on the left, of Philopappos in the centre and of [[Seleucus I Nicator]], now lost, on the right.

In the niche below Philopappos is an inscription in Greek: Φιλόπαππος Επιφάνους Βησαιεύς ("Philopappos, son of Epiphanes of the [[deme]] of the Besa"). This was the name Philopappos carried as an Athenian citizen. In the niche left of Philopappos, a Latin inscription records Philopappos’ titles, honors and his career as a [[Roman magistrate]]: "Caius Iulius Antiochus Philopappos, son of Caius, of the Fabian tribe, consul and Arval brother, admitted to the praetorian rank by the emperor Caesar Nerva [[Trajan]] Optimus [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] Germanicus Dacicus". On the right niche of Philopappos once stood a Greek inscription (now only the base is preserved): Βασιλεύς Αντίοχος Φιλόπαππος Βασιλέως Επιφανούς Αντιόχου ("King Antiochus Philopappos, son of King Antiochus Epiphanes"). 

Below the statue of Antiochus IV, Philopappos' paternal grandfather, is an inscription that states "King Antiochus son of King Antiochus". This inscription honors Antiochus IV and his late father, the last independent ruler of the [[Kingdom of Commagene]], King [[Antiochus III of Commagene|Antiochus III Epiphanes]]. When Antiochus III died in 17, Commagene was annexed by the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Tiberius]] and became a part of the [[Roman Empire]]. Below the statue of Seleucus I, the founder of the [[Seleucid Empire]] from whom the Commagene kings claimed descent, stood another inscription, now lost. The traveller [[Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli|Cyriacus of Ancona]] wrote in his memoir that underneath the inscription stated "King Seleucus Nicator, son of Antiochus".

The monument measures {{convert|9.80|×|9.30|m}}, and contains Philopappos’ burial chamber. The structure is built of white [[Pentelic marble]] on a [[socle (architecture)|socle]] {{convert|3.08|m}} high, made of porous marble and veneered with slabs of [[Hymettus|Hymettian]] marble. The north side of Philopappos’ monument bears lavish architectural decorations.

== Excavations and history ==
In 1898, excavations were carried out at the monument and in 1899 conservation work was undertaken. In 1940, archaeologists H. A. Thompson and J. Travlos conducted small additional excavations. Recent investigations have certified that architectural parts of Philopappos’ Monument were used for construction of the Minaret in the [[Parthenon]]. 

Only two-thirds of the façade remains. The tomb chamber behind the façade is completely destroyed except for the base. The Philopappos Monument was apparently still intact in 1436, when the traveller [[Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli]] visited the monument and wrote in his memoirs that the monument was still intact. The destruction of the monument must have occurred after this time.

== The Philopappou movement ==
The year 2002 saw the rise of a movement in Athens to defend the natural character of what the people call Philopappou Hill, where the Philopappos Monument is located.

With an area of {{convert|173|acre}}, which was declared an archaeological park in 1955-56, it is first and foremost the home of indigenous birds, including the Athenian owl and the peregrine falcon, as well as an important stop-over for many migratory birds, amounting to a total of about 94 different species. It also has a community of land tortoises, bats and a large variety of plant species. Philopappou Hill includes: the Hill of the Muses, the Hill of the Nymphs, and the [[Pnyx]], the latter being of great historical importance, as it was the meeting place of democratic legislatures in ancient times. 
The park is likewise known for the beautiful landscaping and stone pathways created by architect [[Dimitris Pikionis]], who also restored the 16th-century Byzantine chapel of Saint Dimitrios [Loumbardiaris] in 1954-58. In 1996 the Ministry of Culture declared the works of Pikionis a monument of contemporary architecture. They are also listed by UNESCO as a protected monument of cultural heritage. For more than 10 years the residents of the neighbourhoods surrounding the Hill have challenged the plans of the Ministry of Culture to fence the entire 173 acres and restrict access by imposing visiting hours and an entrance fee.

It is to this day the belief of the movement that the best protection for the hill is guaranteed by the love, care and active participation of the local people. As a result of their tenacity, the largest and most naturally beautiful public space in Athens remains free and open to all, day and night.

'''Standard Model''' is the title of an [[exhibition]] held between 1 October and 25 October 2009 at the Nordin Gallery, Stockholm. The exhibition was made in collaboration between Swedish artist Karl Tuikkanen and London based Australian artist David Brazier and represents the first physical manifestation of their artistic partnership exploring ideas of [[communication]] and [[collaboration]] mediated through the [[internet]].

[[File:Standard model.jpg|thumb|500px|Standard Model Installation View, Nordin Gallery, Stockholm, 2009]]

==Process==
Central to the artists’ process has been mining the public information resource [[Wikipedia]], allowing for the logic of the network to develop the content of the exhibition. Beginning with the Wikipedia page for ‘standard model’ the artists used the system of selecting and sending Wikipedia links between Stockholm and London to quickly take them to destinations far removed from their points of departure.

Reminiscent of [[surrealist]] strategies of “[[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]” and “[[Exquisite Corpse]]” Tuikkanen and Brazier relinquish authorial control, choosing instead to hand it over to the web based dialogue and the content of internet links. In doing so, coherence and rationality is discarded for a logic which follows loose associations, without hierarchy or proof of authenticity.

==Links==
Each artist began with the Wikipedia page for ‘[[standard model]]’. From there the artist would select a link and send it to the other artist who would repeat the process until the final information page was six times removed from the original Wikipedia page for ‘standard model’. The information that emerged through this process provided the content for works made and exhibited. This process was repeated 12 times.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7660">'''The Hypocrites''' is a [[Theater in Chicago|Chicago storefront theater company]] founded in 1997 by Sean Graney, Brandon Kruse and Christopher Cintron. The company is currently run by Sean Graney (Artistic Director) and Kelli Strickland (Executive Director). One of [[Chicago]]’s premier off-Loop theater companies, The Hypocrites specializes in mounting bold productions that challenge preconceptions and redefining the role of the audience through unusual staging (such as promenade and in-the-round) and direct engagement. The company has a reputation in Chicago for creating exciting, surprising, and deeply engaging theater as it re-interprets well-known works for contemporary audiences, reveling in the absurd while revealing the core of what makes classics classic.&lt;blockquote&gt;''“The Hypocrites, who with each new production, continue to rise not just to the rank of one of our city’s best storefronts but one of Chicago’s best theaters period.” – Newcity Stage ('''[[American Idiot (musical)|American Idiot]]''', 2015)''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Review: American Idiot/The Hypocrites|url = http://www.newcitystage.com/2015/09/07/review-american-idiotthe-hypocrites/|website = Newcity Stage|accessdate = 2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The company has grown significantly in the past few years, receiving acclaim for productions at the [[Steppenwolf Theatre Company|Steppenwolf Garage]], [[Goodman Theatre]], [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]], DCASE Storefront, Chopin Theater and nationally at American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.), Berkeley Repertory Theatre, and Actors Theatre of Louisville.

== Adaptations ==
Their recent production of Graney’s ''All Our Tragic'', a twelve-hour adaptation combining all 32 surviving Greek Tragedies, garnered the company six 2015 Equity Jeff Awards in its first year of eligibility.&lt;blockquote&gt;“’A watershed moment for off-Loop theater.” – Chris Jones, [[Chicago Tribune]] ('''''All Our Tragic''''', 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = REVIEW: 'All Our Tragic' by The Hypocrites ★★★★|url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/reviews/ct-all-our-tragic-review-column.html|website = chicagotribune.com|accessdate = 2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Graney’s musical adaptations of [[Gilbert and Sullivan|Gilbert &amp; Sullivan]]’s ''[[The Pirates of Penzance|Pirates of Penzance]]'', ''[[The Mikado]]'' and ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' have become audience and critic favorites, being remounted numerous times in Chicago as well as going on tour to [[American Repertory Theater|American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.)]], [[Berkeley Repertory Theatre]], [[Actors Theatre of Louisville]], and [[Olney theater|Olney Theater Center]].&lt;blockquote&gt;''“Cromer calibrates 'Our Town' with clear-eyed intelligence. You see the beauties of small-town America and its limitations, laid out before you as directly and powerfully as the Chicago theater can muster.” – Chris Jones, Chicago Tribune ('''Our Town''', 2008)''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Our Town' director David Cromer does this town proud|url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-05-09/entertainment/0805070688_1_town-steppenwolf-theatre-chicago-theater|website = tribunedigital-chicagotribune|accessdate = 2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Awards ==
Since the company’s founding, The Hypocrites have produced over sixty main stage productions and a dozen festival pieces, securing thirty-one [[Joseph Jefferson Award|Non-Equity Joseph Jefferson]] awards, six Equity Joseph Jefferson awards, and two After Dark Awards.

The [[American Theatre Wing]], best known as the creator of the [[Tony Award]]s, presented The Hypocrites with one of the 2013 National Theatre Company awards. The company's smash-hit production of ''[[Our Town]]'', directed by [[David Cromer]], transferred in 2009 to [[Off-Broadway]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[Boston]].

The Hypocrites began performing in the basement of Café Voltaire, a now defunct vegetarian restaurant in [[Lakeview, Chicago|Lakeview]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoweekly.org/2007/11/21/what-the-director-saw-onstage-with-the-hypocrites-sean-graney/ |title=What the Director Saw: Onstage with the Hypocrites’ Sean Graney |publisher=The Chicago Weekly |date=2007-11-21 |accessdate=2014-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-founder Sean Graney has been the artistic director since early 2015, when he announced his return from a three year hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Rob | last=Weinert-Kendt | title= The Real Story Behind Sean Graney’s Return to the Hypocrites |work=American Theatre | date=January 29, 2015  | url=http://www.americantheatre.org/2015/01/29/the-real-story-behind-sean-graneys-return-to-the-hypocrites/ | accessdate=November 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's name is inspired by [[Eugène Ionesco]]’s ''Notes and Counter Notes'', a compendium of interviews on the nature of theatre throughout which Ionesco regularly contradicts himself — hence its title, and The Hypocrites' name.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5361">[[File:Wide World Magazine.JPG|thumb|''The Wide World Magazine'' - half-yearly volume edition]]
'''''The Wide World Magazine''''' was a British monthly illustrated publication which ran from April 1898 to December 1965.&lt;ref name="collecting"&gt;[http://www.collectingbooksandmagazines.com/wide.html ''The Wide World Magazine''] (collectingbooksandmagazines.com).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--It was resurrected (the same title was registered with Companies House) in 2009 as ''WideWorld'', an online publication headquartered in England and devoted to outdoor sport, adventure and offbeat travel.&lt;ref name="online"&gt;[http://www.wideworldmag.co.uk/ ''WideWorld magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|talk page|date=August 2010}}--&gt;

The magazine was founded by well-known publisher [[George Newnes]], also famous for ''[[Tit-Bits]]'', ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'', ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' and others. It described itself as "an illustrated magazine of true narrative" and each month purported to feature "true-life" adventure and travel stories gathered from around the world. Its motto was "Truth is stranger than fiction".&lt;ref name="collecting" /&gt;

In August 1898, it published the first in a number of installments of "The Adventures of [[Louis de Rougemont]]", billed as "the most amazing story a man ever lived to tell", and claiming to be an account of a man who had spent thirty years in the outback of [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;''The adventures of Louis de Rougemont'' (stories from ''[https://archive.org/details/wideworldmagazin03londuoft ''Wide World Magazine'', volume 3]'', May 1899 &amp; June 1899 , pp. 3-15 and pp. 115-131).&lt;/ref&gt; The story caused a sensation, but was exposed as a hoax by the ''[[Daily Chronicle (United Kingdom)|Daily Chronicle]]'', to the embarrassment of the publisher.&lt;ref&gt;John Arnold, Sally Batten. ''The bibliography of Australian literature, Volume 2  '' p259-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some famous names occasionally wrote for the magazine (such as [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Henry Morton Stanley]], [[Douglas Reeman]] etc.), and it was copiously illustrated with photographs, as well as black and white drawings by such artists as [[Terence Cuneo]], Cecil Stuart Tresilian, Alfred Pearse, Chas Sheldon, Paul Hardy, [[William Barnes Wollen]], John L. Wimbush, Charles J. Staniland, [[Joseph Finnemore]], [[John Charlton (artist)|John Charlton]], [[Warwick Goble]], [[Tom Browne (illustrator)|Tom Browne]], [[Ernest Prater]], [[Gordon Browne]], [[Edward S Hodgson]], Norman H. Hardy, [[Inglis Sheldon Williams]], and [[Harry Rountree]].&lt;ref&gt;See Volumes 3 and 7, for example (bibliography).&lt;/ref&gt;

The May 1913 issue contained the first reports of the death of notorious outlaw [[Butch Cassidy]] in Bolivia.&lt;ref name="collecting" /&gt;

''[[The Times]]'', in retrospect, humorously described the magazine as about "brave chaps with large moustaches on stiff upper lips, who did stupid and dangerous things".&lt;ref&gt;Ben Macintyre. ''[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article494387.ece Buried alive by an elephant]'' (''[[The Sunday Times]]'' - 16 October 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tooth Fairy''' is a [[fantasy]] figure of early childhood in [[Western world|Western]] and Western-influenced cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, John R.; McKee, Judy S.; Jernigan, Louise F., ''Psychological Reports'', Vol. 46 (3, Pt. 1), June 1980. "Children's belief in Santa Claus, Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy". pp. 691–694.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[folklore]] states that when children lose one of their [[Deciduous teeth|baby teeth]], they should place it underneath their pillow and the Tooth Fairy will visit while they sleep, replacing the lost tooth with a small payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Watts|first=Linda S.|title=Encyclopedia of American folklore|year=2007|publisher=Facts on file Inc|location=NY, NY, United States of America|isbn=0-8160-5699-4|pages=386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of leaving a tooth under a pillow for the Tooth Fairy to collect is practiced in various countries.

==Origins==
{{Expand section|date=July 2010}}
In [[Northern Europe]], there was a tradition of ''tand-fé'' or tooth fee, which was paid when a child lost their first tooth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Richard |last1=Cleasby |authorlink1=Richard Cleasby |first2=Gudbrand |last2=Vigfússon |authorlink2=Guðbrandur Vigfússon |title= An Icelandic-English Dictionary |edition= 2 |work=[[William Craigie|William A. Craigie]] |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press ]]|year= 1957}} [http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~kurisuto/germanic/oi_cleasbyvigfusson_about.html s.v. ''tannfé'' first edition available on ''An Icelandic-English Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition is recorded in writings as early as the [[Edda]]s, which are the earliest written record of [[Norsemen|Norse]] and Northern European traditions.

The reward left varies by country, the family's economic status, amounts the child's peers report receiving and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Patcas, Hubertus JM van Waes, Moritz M Daum and Markus A Landolt. ''Medical Journal of Australia'', Vol. 207, 2017. "Tooth Fairy guilty of favouritism!". pp 482-486.{{cite web|url=https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2017/207/11/tooth-fairy-guilty-favouritism|title=tooth-fairy-guilty-favouritism=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hedges, Helen, Joy Cullen. ''Australian Journal of Early Childhood'', Vol. 28, 2003. "The Tooth Fairy Comes, or Is It Just Your Mum and Dad?: A Child's Construction of Knowledge". pp 19-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2013 survey by [[Visa Inc.]] found that American children receive $3.70 per tooth on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-57600762/tooth-fairy-inflation-flies-high|title=Tooth Fairy inflation flies high|date=30 August 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tooth fairy leaving less money|publisher=UPI Quirks in the News|date=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]], other [[superstition]]s arose surrounding children's teeth. In [[England]], for example, children were instructed to burn their baby teeth in order to save the child from hardship in the afterlife. Children who didn't consign their baby teeth to the fire would spend eternity searching for them in the afterlife. The [[Vikings]], it is said, paid children for their teeth. In the Norse culture, children's teeth and other articles belonging to children were said to bring good luck in battle, and Scandinavian warriors hung children's teeth on a string around their necks. Fear of witches was another reason to bury or burn teeth. In medieval Europe, it was thought that if a witch were to get hold of one's teeth, it could lead to them having total power over him or her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recess.ufl.edu/transcripts/2005/0823.shtml|title=Legends of the Tooth Fairy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern incarnation of these traditions into an actual Tooth Fairy has been dated to 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{OED | Tooth fairy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1962,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tooth%20fairy "Tooth fairy,"] [[Merriam-Webster]].com, 2015 (viewed 15 June 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; or 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Heidi|title=8 Popular Tooth Myths Debunked|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/8-popular-tooth-myths-debunked-8#slide-8|accessdate=10 February 2014|newspaper=[[Popular Mechanics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there is an earlier reference to the tooth fairy in a 1908 "Household Hints" item in the ''Chicago Daily Tribune'':
{{quotation|"Tooth Fairy.
Many a refractory child will allow a loose tooth to be removed if he knows about the Tooth Fairy.  If he takes his little tooth and puts it under the pillow when he goes to bed the Tooth Fairy will come in the night and take it away, and in its place will leave some little gift.  It is a nice plan for mothers to visit the 5 cent counter and lay in a supply of articles to be used on such occasions.

==Appearance==
Unlike [[Santa Claus]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[Easter Bunny]], there are few details of the Tooth Fairy's appearance that are consistent in various versions of the myth. A 1984 study conducted by [[Rosemary Wells]] revealed that most, 74 percent of those surveyed, believed the Tooth Fairy to be female, while 12 percent believed the Tooth Fairy to be neither male nor female and 8 percent believed the Tooth Fairy could be either male or female.&lt;ref name="Toledo Blade"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FkdSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vQIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3809,192140&amp;dq=tooth-fairy&amp;hl=en|title=Tooth Fairy Lore Extracted|date=2 February 1984|work=[[Toledo Blade]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about her findings regarding the Tooth Fairy's appearance, Wells explained - "You've got your basic Tinkerbell-type Tooth Fairy with the wings, wand, a little older and whatnot. Then you have some people who think of the tooth fairy as a man, or a bunny rabbit or a mouse."&lt;ref name="The Milwaukee Journal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4zcdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NCwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6626,6866738&amp;dq=tooth-fairy&amp;hl=en|title=The tooth fairy: friend or foe?|date=31 July 1991|work=[[The Milwaukee Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; One review of published children's books and popular artwork found the Tooth Fairy to also be depicted as a child with wings, a [[pixie]], a [[dragon]], a blue mother-figure, a flying [[ballerina]], two little old men, a dental hygienist, a potbellied flying man smoking a cigar, a bat, a bear and others. Unlike the well-established imagining of Santa Claus, differences in renderings of the Tooth Fairy are not as upsetting to children.&lt;ref name=Wells/&gt;
 
===Depiction on coins and currency===
Starting in 2011, the [[Royal Canadian Mint]] began selling special sets for newborn babies, birthdays, wedding anniversaries, "Oh Canada" and the Tooth Fairy. The Tooth Fairy quarters, which were issued only in 2011 and 2012, were packaged separately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebay.com/sch/sis.html?_nkw=2012%20CANADA%20Tooth%20Fairy%20Gift%20Sett%20Special%20quarter%20reverse%20Mint%20sealed%20&amp;_itemId=200712964004 2012 CANADA Tooth Fairy Gift Sett Special quarter reverse Mint sealed | eBay]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belief==
{{See also|Paternalistic deception}}
Belief in the Tooth Fairy is viewed in two very different ways. On the one hand, children believing is seen as part of the trusting nature of childhood. Conversely, belief in the Tooth Fairy is frequently used to label adults as being too trusting and ready to believe anything.&lt;ref name=Wells&gt;[[Rosemary Wells|Wells, Rosemary]]. "The Making of an Icon: The Tooth Fairy in North American Folklore and Popular Culture" in ''The Good People: New Fairylore Essays''. Peter Narváez ed., 1997. pp 426-446. [[University Press of Kentucky]].&lt;/ref&gt;

While parents are often unsure of themselves when promoting the fiction of the Tooth Fairy, the majority of children report positive outcomes. Upon learning the Tooth Fairy is not real, 75% of children reported liking the custom; 20% were neutral and 3% were not in favor and said they did not intend to continue the practice.

Parents tend to view the myth as providing comfort for children in the loss of their tooth.&lt;ref name=Wells/&gt; Research finds that belief in the Tooth Fairy may provide such comfort to a child experiencing fear or pain resulting from the loss of a tooth.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;Clark, Cindy Dell. "Flight Toward Maturity: The Tooth Fairy" in ''Flights of Fancy, Leaps of Faith: Children's Myths in Contemporary America''. [[University of Chicago Press]], 1995. pp 355-364.&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers especially seem to value a child's belief as a sign that their "baby" is still a child and is not "growing up too soon".&lt;ref name=Wells/&gt; By encouraging belief in a fictional character, parents allow themselves to be comforted that their child still believes in fantasy and is not yet "grown up".&lt;ref name=Clark /&gt;

Children often discover the Tooth Fairy is imaginary as part of the 5- to 7-year shift, often connecting this to other gift-bearing imaginary figures (such as [[Santa Claus]] and the [[Easter Bunny]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sameroff, Arnold and Susan C. Mcdonough. ''Phi Delta Kappan'', Vol. 76, 1994, "Educational implications of developmental transitions: revisiting the 5- to 7-year shift".&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Vicki Lansky]] advises parents to tell their children early that the tooth fairy pays a whole lot more for a perfect tooth than for a decayed one. According to Lansky, some families leave a note with the payment, praising the child for good dental habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lansky|first=Vicki|title=Practical parenting tips|publisher=Unicorn books|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-7806-005-1|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research findings suggest a possible relationship between a child's continued belief in the Tooth Fairy (and other fictional characters) and [[false memory syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;Principe1, Gabrielle F. and Eric Smith. ''Applied Cognitive Psychology'', Volume 22, Issue 5, pages 625–642, July 2008. "The tooth, the whole tooth and nothing but the tooth: how belief in the Tooth Fairy can engender false memories".&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove section|date=October 2011}}
The [[Ratoncito Pérez]] (or Ratón Pérez, "Pérez Mouse" in English) is a figure popular in Spanish and Hispanic American cultures, similar to the Tooth Fairy, originating in Madrid in 1894. As is traditional in some English-speaking countries, when a child loses a tooth it is customary for him or her to place it under the pillow, so that Ratoncito Pérez will exchange it for a gift. The tradition is almost universal in Spanish cultures, but takes different forms in different areas. He is known as "Ratoncito Pérez" in Spanish speaking countries, with the exception of some regions of Mexico, Peru and Chile, where he is called "el Ratón de los Dientes" (The Tooth Mouse), and in Argentina, Venezuela, Uruguay and Colombia, he is known simply as "El Ratón Pérez". The [[Ratoncito Pérez]] was used by [[Colgate (toothpaste)|Colgate]] marketing in Venezuela&lt;ref name="Producto"&gt;[http://www.producto.com.ve/productor/gdental.html ¡Producto Registrado!: Agosto 1998: Centuria Dental] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020074258/http://www.producto.com.ve/productor/gdental.html |date=20 October 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Spain.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} 

In [[Italy]], the Tooth Fairy is also often replaced by a small mouse, named ''Topolino''.

In [[France]] and French-speaking [[Belgium]], this character is called ''la petite souris'' ("[[The Little Mouse|the little mouse]]"). From parts of [[Lowland Scotland]] comes a tradition similar to the fairy mouse: a white fairy rat who purchases children's teeth with coins.

In the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], and specially in [[Biscay]], there is ''Mari Teilatukoa'' (Mary from the roof), who lives in the roof of the [[baserri]] and catches the teeth thrown by the children.

In some [[Asia|Asian countries]], such as [[India]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]], when a child loses a tooth, it is customary for him or her to throw it onto the roof if it came from the lower jaw, or into the space beneath the floor if it came from the upper jaw. While doing this, the child shouts a request for the tooth to be replaced with the tooth of a mouse. This tradition is based on the fact that the teeth of mice grow for their entire lives, a characteristic of all rodents. In some cultures in India, children bury their teeth in the soil near big trees.

In [[Japan]], a different variation calls for lost upper teeth to be thrown straight down to the ground and lower teeth straight up into the air; the idea is that incoming teeth will grow in straight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beeler|first=Selby B.|title=Throw Your Tooth on the Roof: Tooth Traditions from Around the World|year=1998|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Company]]|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-6181-5238-4|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Middle Eastern countries (including [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]]), there is a tradition of throwing a baby tooth up into the sky to the sun or to [[Allah]]. This tradition may originate in a pre-Islamic offering, and dates back to at least the 13th century. It is also mentioned by [[Izz bin Hibat Allah Al Hadid]] in the 13th century.&lt;ref name=Hamdani&gt;Al Hamdani, Muwaffak and Wenzel, Marian. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1258921 The Worm in the Tooth]", ''Folklore'', 1966, vol. 77, pp. 60-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Top-left lighting''' is an artistic convention in which illustrations are produced so that the light appears to come from the top left of the picture.

Most people prefer lighting from the left when resolving a convex-concave ambiguity, and this preference may be stronger for [[right-handedness|right-handed]] people.  This is reflected in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[mosaic]]s and in [[Renaissance painting|Renaissance]], [[baroque painting|baroque]] and [[Impressionism|impressionist]] art.&lt;ref&gt;J. Sun and P. Perona, "Where is the sun?", ''Nature Neuroscience'', 1(3), 183-184, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McManus|first=I Christopher|author2=Joseph Buckman |author3=Euan Woolley |title=Is light in pictures presumed to come from the left side?|journal=Perception|date=2004|volume=33|page=1422|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ian_Mcmanus/publication/8003531_Is_light_in_pictures_presumed_to_come_from_the_left_side/file/79e4151052666c381c.pdf|accessdate=4 March 2014|doi=10.1068/p5289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cartography, the predominant custom of placing the shadow on the right-hand side of [[cartographic relief depiction#Hill profiles|hill profiles]] was established during the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;E. Imhof, ''Cartographic Relief Presentation'', Walter de Gruyter, 1982, reissued by ESRI Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-58948-026-1}}, pp. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Computer interfaces tend to use top left lighting as well, although this trend has gradually shifted more towards light coming straight from the top.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

There are notable exceptions to this convention, such as Sandro Botticelli's [[The_Birth_of_Venus_(Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]] due to the point of view which may represent geographical perspective and location.

He often uses the name Van T Rudd or Van as a signature on his art as a visual mockery of the popular [[Vans]] clothing company. He is influenced by the theories of [[Karl Marx]], and many other revolutionary activists and artists who have been struggling against the forces of [[capitalism]]. 

Rudd has been producing art for over twenty years. He was a musician, mostly as a drummer, bass guitarist and keyboardist in bands Cheezlekane (1993 to 2002), Seconds (2001 to 2007) and Granma (2005 to 2006).

For many of his younger years, he was involved in numerous creative projects with Rad including film making and acting. As a drummer, Rudd joined a Brisbane-based indie pop-rock band called Cheezlekane in the early 1990s with members Patrick Devery (lead vocals), Cameron Peterson (bass guitar) and Nick Stamford (guitar). They played many pub gigs in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne and gained interest from [[Geffen Records]] in 1998 due to their first 4-track produced album called Knee High Fidelity. With musician friends Iain Wilson, Ritchie Giliberto and Mark Buggy, Rudd formed the band Seconds with his brother Rad as lead singer. He also was a keyboardist in a band called Stalis Vetch with Rad. He has a partner and experienced youth worker of [[Chilean Australian|Chilean heritage]], Tania; daughter, Loyola; and son, Manolo.

In 2004 Rudd was selected as a finalist in the 2004 [http://www.metrogallery.com.au/ Metro Art Competition] with a realist-style artwork depicting a combined version of paintings by Albert Tucker and Jeffery Smart .

== The Carriers Project (2004 to 2007) and Controversy ==
In 2004, as Rudd's paintings became more politicized, he decided that exhibiting his large paintings inside galleries wasn't going to reach large audiences, so he began carrying them in public. He was to call this [http://www.multiculturalarts.com.au/events2007/vanrudd.shtml The Carriers Project]. He entered the project in various festivals based in Melbourne including [[Melbourne Fringe Festival|Fringe]] and later the [[Big West Festival]], and it later culminated in a national tour of Australia through [http://www.multiculturalarts.com.au/events2007/vanrudd.shtml kultour]. Some of his paintings depicting 'exploding terrorists' created unease with authorities in [https://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/rudds-nephew-faced-arrest/news-story/a0a23fb65dddda105fec6f7ef0fb1802?sv=d3ff0b7a6fb98b42aac8f6fdf2957d94 Brisbane] and Perth. He claims he was adding valuable commentary about the anti-terror laws in Australia. It was a coincidence that, in 2007, while Rudd was in Perth completing his national tour, that his uncle Kevin Rudd was elected Prime Minister of Australia.  

== Pro-Palestinian Artwork Censored in Footscray (2006) ==
In 2006, Rudd created an artwork called 'Portrait of an Exploding Terrorist'. It was a combined painting and billboard piece in one. He carried the painting around the streets of Melbourne, while exhibiting a large piece on the public billboard at [http://www.trocaderoartspace.com.au/ Trocadero Art Space, Footscray.]It wasn't long before the local council demanded the billboard piece be removed, claiming it constituted litter. Gallery director Michael Brennan and Rudd were forced to remove the piece to avoid paying a large fine. The piece was critical of the State of Israel and argued that it inflicted terror upon the Palestinian people. 

==Hugo Chávez mural (2007)==
In 2007 Rudd created an artwork depicting a large mural on a gallery wall at Trocadero Art Space in Footscray with signatories of Australians who supported a visit to the country by [[Venezuelan President]] [[Hugo Chávez]]. It was titled "Smells Like Sulphur: A Tribute to Venezuela and the Art of Telling Bush to Piss Off", referencing Chavez' [[UN General Assembly]] speech the previous year, when he called former [[US President]] [[George W.

The local media tried to whip up [https://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/dont-tell-uncle-kev/328769/ controversy] around Rudd's painting because it showed a U.S flag burning. 

==Banksy homage (2008)==
In 2008 the [[City of Melbourne]] rejected a painting by Rudd depicting [[Ronald McDonald]] setting fire to [[Thích Quảng Đức]] with the Olympic torch. According to Rudd, the artwork was a [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to British [[street art]]ist [[Banksy]] and a comment on [[human rights]] abuses in the run-up to the [[2008 Olympic Games]]. Rudd accused the City of Melbourne of political censorship which they denied, claiming he was solely picked to feature in the [[Ho Chi Minh City]] exhibition for his [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] heritage.&lt;ref name= Rudd /&gt;

A '''video synthesizer''' is a device that electronically creates a [[video]] signal.  A video synthesizer is able to generate a variety of visual material without camera input through the use of internal video pattern generators.  It can also accept and "clean up and enhance" or "distort" live television camera imagery. The synthesizer creates a wide range of imagery through purely electronic manipulations. This imagery is visible within the output video signal when this signal is displayed. The output video signal can be viewed on a wide range of conventional video equipment, such as TV monitors, theater video projectors, computer displays, etc.

Video pattern generators may produce static or moving or evolving imagery.  Examples include geometric patterns (in 2D or 3D), subtitle text characters in a particular font, or weather maps.

Imagery from TV cameras can be altered in color or geometrically scaled, tilted, wrapped around objects, and otherwise manipulated.

A particular video synthesizer will offer a subset of possible effects.

== Video Synthesizers as Real Time performance instruments ==

The history of video synthesis is tied to a "real time performance" ethic.  The equipment is usually expected to function on input camera signals the machine has never seen before, delivering a processed signal continuously and with a minimum of delay in response to the ever-changing live video inputs.  Following in the tradition of performance instruments of the audio synthesis world such as the [[Theremin]], video synthesizers were designed with the expectation they would be played in live concert theatrical situations or set up in a studio ready to process a videotape from a playback VCR in real time while recording the results on a second VCR.  Venues of these performances included "Electronic Visualization Events" in Chicago, [http://www.thekitchen.org The Kitchen] in NYC, and museum installations.  Video artist/performer Don Slepian [http://DonSlepian.com] designed, built and performed a foot-controlled Visual Instrument at the Centre Pompidou in Paris (1983) and the NY Open Center that combined [[Genlocking|genlocked]] early micro-computers [[Apple II Plus]] with the Chromaton 14 Video Synthesizer
[http://www.audiovisualizers.com/toolshak/vidsynth/chroma14/chroma14.htm] and channels of colorized video feedback.

Analog and early real time digital synthesizers existed before modern computer 3D modeling.  Typical 3D renderers are not real time, as they concentrate on computing each frame from, for example, a recursive ray tracing algorithm, however long it takes.  This distinguishes them from video synthesizers, which must deliver a new output frame by the time the last one has been shown, and repeat this performance continuously (typically delivering a new frame regularly every 1/60 or 1/50 of a second). The real time constraint results in a difference in design philosophy between these two classes of systems.

Video synthesizers overlap with [[video special effects]] equipment used in real time network television broadcast and post-production situations.  Many innovations in television broadcast equipment as well as computer graphics displays evolved from synthesizers developed in the [[Video art|video artists' community]] and these industries often support "electronic art projects" in this area to show appreciation of this history.

==Confluence of ideas of Electronics and Arts==
Many principles used in the construction of early video synthesizers reflected a healthy and dynamic interplay between electronic requirements and traditional interpretations of artistic forms.
For example, [[Steve Rutt|Rutt]] &amp; [[Bill Etra|Etra]] and [[Daniel J. Sandin|Sandin]] carried forward as an essential principle ideas of [[Robert Moog]] that standardized signal ranges so that any module's output could be connected to "voltage control" any other module's input.  The consequence of this in a machine like the Rutt-Etra was that position, brightness, and color were completely interchangeable and could be used to modulate each other during the processing that led to the final image.  Videotapes by Louise and [[Bill Etra]] and [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]] dramatized this new class of effects. This led to various interpretations of the multi-modal synthesesia of these aspects of the image in dialogues that extended the McLuhanesque language of film criticism of the time.

which used the EMS patchboard system to allow completely flexible connections between module inputs and outputs. The video signals were digital, but they were controlled by analog voltages. There was a digital patchboard for image composition and an analog patchboard for motion control.

==Evolution into Frame Buffers==
Video synthesizers moved from analog to the precision control of digital.  The first digital effects as exemplified by [[Stephen Beck]]'s Video Weavings used digital oscillators optionally linked to horizontal, vertical, or frame resets to generate timing ramps.  These ramps could be gated to create the video image itself and were responsible for its underlying geometric texture.  Schier and Vasulka advanced the state of the art from address counters to programmable (microcodable) [[Am2900|AMD Am2901]] bit slice based address generators.  On the data path, they used 74S181 arithmetic and logic units, previously thought of as a component for doing arithmetic instructions in minicomputers, to process real time video signals, creating new signals representing the sum, difference, AND, XOR, and so on, of two input signals.  These two elements, the address generator, and the video data pipeline, recur as core features of digital video architecture.

The address generator supplied read and write addresses to a real time video memory, which can be thought of as evolution into the most flexible form of gating the address bits together to produce the video.  While the video frame buffer is now present in every computer's graphics card, it has not carried forward a number of features of the early video synths.  The address generator counts in a fixed rectangular pattern from the upper left hand corner of the screen, across each line, to the bottom.  This discarded a whole technology of modifying the image by variations in the read and write addressing sequence provided by the hardware address generators as the image passed through the memory.  Today, address based distortions are more often accomplished by [[blitter]] operations moving data in the memory, rather than changes in video hardware addressing patterns.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5713">The '''William Hodges Fellowship''' residency programme is the successor to the '''Southland Art Foundation Artist in Residence'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mch.govt.nz/funding-nz-culture/search-funding?detail=802504/B Ministry for Culture and Heritage - The William Hodges Fellowship]&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the William Hodges Fellowship date back to 1981. The Southland Art Foundation Artist In Residence was established in 1996 by a joint partnership between Southland Art Foundation, Creative New Zealand, Southland Museum &amp; Art Gallery and the Southern Institute of Technology.

In 1999 the [[Southland Art Foundation]] Trustees–Shirley Palmer, Gwen Neave, [[Russell Beck]] and [[Wayne P Marriott]] resolved to rename the Artist in Residence programme the [[William Hodges]] Fellowship.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} This was in recognition of the acquisition of William Hodges “Maori before a Waterfall”, 1773 by the Southland Museum &amp; Art Gallery in 1998. Hodges was regarded as the first non-Maori artist in residence in Southland, having depicted the flora, fauna and people of the region during Cook’s second voyage to New Zealand.

The inaugural William Hodges Fellowship was awarded to Jo Ogier, printmaker, from Dunedin in 2000.

On Friday 3 November 2000 Burwell House was opened as the residence for the William Hodges Fellow.&lt;ref name="beehive.govt.nz"&gt;[http://www.beehive.govt.nz/speech/opening-burwell-house-artist039s-residence-invercargill beehive.govt.nz - Opening of Burwell House, Artist's Residence, Invercargill]&lt;/ref&gt;

The partnership of [[Southland Museum and Art Gallery]], [[Southland Art Foundation]], [[Southern Institute of Technology]], and [[Creative New Zealand]] has continued to develop the fellowship, providing the opportunity for artists to work financially unencumbered for a period of time, as well as working closely with the local community.&lt;ref name="beehive.govt.nz"/&gt;

The '''Wynwood Art District''' is a district of the [[Wynwood]] neighborhood of [[Miami]], [[Florida]]. It is home to over 70 galleries, museums and collections.  It is roughly bounded by North 36th Street ([[U.S. Route 27 in Florida|US 27]]) (north)&lt;!--East of [[Miami Avenue]], it's "NE" and "NW" west of it--&gt;, North 20th Street (south)&lt;!--East of [[Miami Avenue]], it's "NE" and "NW" west of it--&gt;, [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]] (west) and Northeast First Avenue (east). It is one of the largest open-air street art installations in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wynwoodmiami.com/about.php |title=Wynwood Miami |publisher=Wynwood Miami |date= |accessdate=2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
[[File:FC preserved.jpg|thumb|Letters of "war" spray painted over space picture and oversprayed with "FC preserved"]]
The Wynwood Art District Association was founded in early 2003 by a group of art dealers, artists and curators Mark Coetzee, Nina Arias and Nick Cindric. Mark Coetzee initiated the idea based on a similar project, Art Night, which he started in his hometown, Cape Town, South Africa. Founding members at the first meeting in Rocket Projects media room were Brook Dorsch of Dorsch Gallery, Weston Charles, [[COOPER (artist)|Cooper]] and [[Elizabeth Withstandley]] of [[Locust Projects]], Mark Coetzee of the Rubell Collection, Nina Arias and Nick Cindric of Rocket Projects, Bernice Steinbaum of Bernice Steinbaum Gallery, and Marina Kessler of Marina Kessler Gallery. The association created the Second Saturdays Gallery Walk, designed the Manhole cover logo along with the light banners that hang on street corners, and publishes annual brochures with a map and a list of the association's members. 

It was once home to over 70 galleries, five museums, three collections, seven art complexes, 12 art studios, five art fairs and the Wynwood Walls. Gentrification and rising rent prices have pushed out most of the smaller galleries. In 2018, less than ten galleries remain.

The Wynwood Walls were created in 2009 by the late Tony Goldman in an effort to develop the area's pedestrian potential. Goldman bought his first building in [[Wynwood]] in 2004, and owned nearly two dozen properties by 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Caplan |first1=Benjy |title=Paint The Walls |url=http://features.miaminewtimes.com/wynwood-street-art/ |accessdate=29 July 2018 |publisher=Miami New Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists from around the world have contributed to the Wynwood Walls. The Walls have been covered by media such as the ''New York Times'' and the BBC bringing international attention to the destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Alvarez |first1=Lizette |title=Breathing Life, and Art, Into a Downtrodden Neighborhood |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/us/wynwood-in-miami-getting-a-new-life-and-art.html |accessdate=29 July 2018 |publisher=The New York Times |date=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also featured in the docu-series entitled ''Here Comes the Neighborhood''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Furst |first1=Jenner |title=Here Comes the Neighborhood |url=https://vimeo.com/herecomestheneighborhood |website=Vimeo.com |publisher=Cinemart in Association With Goldman Properties |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walls have expanded to include murals outside the neighborhood, including Outside the Walls which features art covering entire buildings. In 2010, Goldman added the Wynwood Doors to highlight smaller artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wynwood Miami |title=Wynwood Doors |url=https://wynwoodmiami.com/street_art/wynwood-doors/ |website=WynwoodMiami.com |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Curbed]]'' listed Wynwood Walls as among the 16 most Instagrammable places in US cities in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barber |first1=Megan |title=The 16 most Instagrammable places in U.S. cities |url=https://www.curbed.com/2018/7/18/17585406/best-instagram-places-photo-spots |accessdate=29 July 2018 |publisher=Curbed |date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every second Saturday of each month, a community-wide art walk is held. Galleries, art studios, alternative spaces and showrooms open their doors to the public for art, music and refreshments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wynwood Miami |title=Art Walk |url=https://wynwoodmiami.com/experience/art-walk/ |website=WynwoodMiami.com |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yuri Ivanovitch Manin''' ({{lang-ru|Ю́рий Ива́нович Ма́нин}}; born 1937) is a Russian mathematician, known for work in [[algebraic geometry]] and [[diophantine geometry]], and many expository works ranging from [[mathematical logic]] to [[theoretical physics]]. Moreover, Manin was one of the first to propose the idea of a [[quantum computer]] in [[Timeline of quantum computing|1980]] with his book "Computable and Uncomputable".&lt;ref name="manin1980vychislimoe"&gt;{{cite book| author=Manin, Yu. I.| title=Vychislimoe i nevychislimoe|trans-title=Computable and Noncomputable| year=1980| publisher=Sov.Radio| url=http://publ.lib.ru/ARCHIVES/M/MANIN_Yuriy_Ivanovich/Manin_Yu.I._Vychislimoe_i_nevychislimoe.%281980%29.%5Bdjv%5D.zip| pages=13–15| language=Russian| accessdate=2013-03-04| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510173823/http://publ.lib.ru/ARCHIVES/M/MANIN_Yuriy_Ivanovich/Manin_Yu.I._Vychislimoe_i_nevychislimoe.%281980%29.%5Bdjv%5D.zip| archivedate=2013-05-10| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Manin gained a doctorate in 1960 at the [[Steklov Mathematics Institute]] as a student of [[Igor Shafarevich]]. He is now a Professor at the [[Max-Planck-Institut für Mathematik]] in [[Bonn]], and a professor [[emeritus]] at [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/node/99|title=Yuri Manin {{!}} Max Planck Institute for Mathematics|website=www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de|language=en|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.math.northwestern.edu/people/emeriti/ |title=Emeriti Faculty: Department of Mathematics - Northwestern University |website=www.math.northwestern.edu |language=en |access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manin's early work included papers on the arithmetic and [[formal group]]s of [[abelian varieties]], the [[Mordell conjecture]] in the [[global function field|function field]] case, and [[algebraic differential equation]]s. The [[Gauss–Manin connection]] is a basic ingredient of the study of [[cohomology]] in families of [[algebraic varieties]]. He wrote a book on [[cubic surface]]s and [[cubic form]]s, showing how to apply both classical and contemporary methods of algebraic geometry, as well as [[nonassociative algebra]]. He also indicated the role of the [[Brauer group]], via [[Grothendieck]]'s theory of global [[Azumaya algebra]]s, in accounting for obstructions to the [[Hasse principle]], setting off a generation of further work. He also formulated the [[Manin conjecture]], which predicts the asymptotic behaviour of the number of rational points of bounded height on algebraic varieties. He has further written on [[Yang–Mills theory]], [[quantum information]], and [[mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]].

Manin had over 40 doctoral students, including [[Vladimir Berkovich]], [[Mariusz Wodzicki]], [[Alexander Beilinson]], [[Ivan Cherednik]], [[Alexei Skorobogatov]], [[Vladimir Drinfeld]], [[Mikhail Kapranov]], [[Vyacheslav Shokurov]], [[Arend Bayer]] and [[Victor Kolyvagin]], as well as foreign students including [[Hà Huy Khoái]], now the most senior mathematician in Vietnam.   He was awarded the [[Brouwer Medal]] in 1987, the [[Schock Prize]] in 1999 and the [[Cantor Medal]] in 2002.  In 1994, he was awarded the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]]. In 2010, he received the [[Bolyai Prize]] of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].

In 1990 he became foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/foreign-members/4514 |title=Y.I.
