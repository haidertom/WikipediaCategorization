==Plot==
&lt;!--PLEASE READ: Per WP: FILM PLOT, plots are 400-700 words only--&gt;
Twelve-year-old Conor O'Malley must face his mother's terminal cancer, his strict grandmother, his estranged father and the school bully, Harry. One night at 12:07&amp;nbsp;a.m., Conor is visited by the tree-like Monster, who tells Conor it has to come to tell him three true stories, after which Conor must tell the Monster his own story: the truth behind his nightmare, which Conor refuses to do.

; First story
An old king who has lost his entire family (with his sons killed in fierce battles and his wife committing suicide in her grief) save a young grandson, remarries a beautiful young woman. He dies before the prince comes of age, and many believe the queen poisoned the king. Not wanting to hand the kingdom over to the prince in a year, she plots to marry the prince and remain queen. The prince runs away with a farm girl he loves. They stop and sleep under a yew tree (the Monster), but in the morning he finds the young woman murdered. The prince tells the villagers that the queen, a witch, must have done it, and they rally to overthrow her. Before the commoners can reach the queen, the Monster carries her away to a far-off land where she lives out the rest of her life in peace. Though she was indeed a witch, she did not kill the farm girl or the king, who actually died of old age. The prince had murdered the farm girl himself in order to inspire his people to back him into overthrowing the queen. After the queen was taken to safety by the Monster, the prince continued to rule the kingdom in the grandfather's place.

; Second story
An [[apothecary]] follows old traditions and beliefs, using herbs and brews to cure ailments. His business becomes less popular as a local [[parson]] tells his congregation not to accept the apothecary's old ways and denying the apothecary use of an old Yew tree. When the parson's two daughters become sick, the parson asks the apothecary to save their lives after all other resources are exhausted. When the apothecary asks why he should help a man who has turned people away from his skills and denied him the yew tree, his best source of healing ingredients, the parson promises to give him the tree and deliver the parishioners to him as customers. Yet the apothecary says that he cannot help, and the girls die. The Monster awakens from the yew tree to destroy the parson's house and raze it to the ground as punishment.

While the apothecary was a greedy man, he was a healer and would have saved lives, including the girls', if the parson had allowed him his way of life. The parson was a man of belief but was willing to discard his beliefs when they were in the way. The healing traditions followed by the apothecary require belief in order to work; without the parson's, the apothecary was unable to treat the two girls. Belief is half the cure.

; Third story
A man was invisible because no one ever saw him. Tired of this, he summoned the Monster to ensure people would notice him. Though people now notice him, the man finds himself more alone than before.

; Fourth story
Conor must confront his nightmare to tell the fourth story. His mother has been pulled to the edge of a cliff by a sudden collapse of the ground, and Conor must hold her hand to save her from falling. Eventually, his grip fails and his mother falls. The Monster forces Conor to confess the truth: Conor loosened his grip on purpose. While he could have held on longer, he let go in order to stop the pain of having to hold on.

Through the Monster, Conor ultimately understands that although he does not want his mother to die, it is something he must accept, and he must not feel guilty for wanting it to be over so he does not have to feel pain anymore. After this, Conor returns, with the Monster by his side, to comfort his mother one last time, and she dies at 12:07. He returns home with his grandmother, with whom he has reached an understanding, and she gives Conor the room that used to be his mother's. In the room, he finds his mother's old art book, which depicts the stories that were told to him by the Monster, and a drawing of his mother as a child with the Monster.

{{wiktionary|agon}}

'''Agon''' ([[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀγών}}) is an ancient Greek term for a struggle or contest. This could be a contest in athletics, in [[chariot#Greece|chariot]] or horse racing, or in music or literature at a public festival in ancient Greece. Agon is the word-forming element in 'agony', explaining the concept of agon(y) in [[tragedy]] by its fundamental characters, the [[protagonist]] and antagonist.

== Athletics ==

In one sense, agon meant a contest or a competition in athletics, for example, the [[Ancient Olympic games|Olympic Games]] (Ὀλυμπιακοὶ Ἀγῶνες). Agon was also a [[Greek mythology|mythological]] personification of the contests listed above.&lt;ref name="DGRBM"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Schmitz  | first = Leonhard  | author-link =   | contribution = Agon  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | page = 74  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0083.html | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;&amp;#123;&amp;#123;inconsistent citations&amp;#125;&amp;#125;  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This god was represented in a statue at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] with ''[[halteres (ancient Greece)|halteres]]'' ([[dumbbells]]) ({{lang|grc|ἁλτῆρες}}) in his hands.  This statue was a work of [[Dionysius (sculptor)|Dionysius]], and dedicated by Micythus of [[Rhegium]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', book V (Elis), v. 26. § 3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion ==

Agon also referred to a challenge that was held in connection with [[religious festival]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Trapido (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; With a further religious meaning as used in [[1 Timothy]] 6:12 in the [[New Testament]] and defined by [[Strong's Concordance]] as, agón: a gathering, contest, struggle; as an (athletic) contest; hence, a struggle (in the soul).&lt;ref&gt;[http://concordances.org/greek/73.htm Strong's Concordance]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theater ==

In [[Ancient Greek theatre|Ancient Greek drama]], particularly [[Old Comedy]] (fifth century B.C.),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Humphreys|first=Milton W.|title=The Agon of the Old Comedy|journal=The American Journal of Philology|date=1887|volume=8|issue=2| pages=179–206|doi=10.2307/287385|jstor=287385}}&lt;/ref&gt; agon refers to a contest or debate between two characters - the prot''agonist'' and the ant''agonist'' - in the highly structured Classical [[tragedy|tragedies]] and [[drama]]s. The agon could also develop between an [[acting|actor]] and the [[choir]] or between two actors with half of the chorus supporting each. Through the argument of opposing principles, the agon in these performances resembled the dialectic dialogues of [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;["agon." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2014. Web. 17 Feb. 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the term has escaped the circumscriptions of its classical origins to signify, more generally, the conflict on which a literary work turns.

==Dance==
In 1948, [[Lincoln Kirstein]] posed the idea of a ballet that would later become known as ''[[Agon (ballet)|Agon]]''. After ten years of work before ''Agon'''s premiere, it became the final ballet in a series of collaborations between choreographer [[George Balanchine]] and composer [[Igor Stravinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alm |first1=Irene |title=Stravinsky, Balanchine, and Agon: An Analysis Based on the Collaborative Process |journal=The Journal of Musicology |date=April 1989 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=254–269 |doi=10.2307/763771}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balanchine referred to this ballet as "the most perfect work" to come out of the collaboration between Stravinsky and himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jordan |first1=Stephanie |title=Agon: A Musical/Choreographic Analysis |journal=Dance Research Journal |date=Autumn 1993 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=1–12 |doi=10.2307/1478549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature ==

[[Harold Bloom]] in ''The Western Canon'' uses the term ''agon'' to refer to the attempt by a writer to resolve an intellectual conflict between his ideas and the ideas of an influential predecessor in which "the larger swallows the smaller", such as in chapter 18, [[James Joyce|Joyce]]'s agon with [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].

In "Man, Play, and Games" [[Roger Caillois]] uses the term Agon to define games of competitive nature.

== Sociopolitical theory ==
In sociopolitical theory, agon can refer to the idea that the clash of opposing forces necessarily results in growth and progress.&lt;ref&gt;Colaguori 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derivatives ==
Words derived from ''agon'' include [[wikt:agony|agony]], [[wikt:agonism|agonism]], [[wikt:antagonism|antagonism]], and [[wikt:protagonist|protagonist]].

It comprised an [[exhibition]], a [[publication]] and a [[lecture]] series that all focused on the heart and brain in various fields: [[art]], [[science]], [[religion]], the [[occult]] and [[cooking]], in order to reflect on the philosophical and practical relationship between art and science.&lt;ref&gt;Begrepp en Samling, 1992, ed.

In the exhibition, one could see two large metal and glass sculptures of the heart and the brain that contained the crumbled posters promoting the exhibition. Large photographs of histological samples of the two organs sat next to scientific abstracts, occult and religious images. Close to the entry of the exhibition, hearts and brains of various animals including and elephant and a lemur which had been lent by the Museum of Natural History sat next to recipes of how to cook the organs.&lt;ref&gt;Tjugo år : Maria Bonnier Dahlins stiftelse : 1985-2005, Ed.

[[File:Blind men and elephant.jpg|thumb|Blind men and elephant]]
The [[parable]] of the '''blind men and an elephant''' originated in the ancient [[Indian subcontinent]], from where it has been widely diffused. However the meaning of the popular [[proverb]] differs in other countries. It is a story of a group of blind men, who have never come across an [[elephant]] before and who learn and conceptualize what the elephant is like by touching it. Each blind man feels a different part of the elephant's body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their limited experience and their descriptions of the elephant are different from each other. In some versions, they come to suspect that the other person is dishonest and they come to blows. The moral of the parable is that humans have a tendency to claim absolute truth based on their limited, subjective experience as they ignore other people's limited, subjective experiences which may be equally true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E. Bruce Goldstein|title=Encyclopedia of Perception|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6M3NSNm6MlkC&amp;pg=PA492|year=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-4081-8|page=492}}, '''Quote:''' The ancient Hindu parable of the six blind men and the elephant...."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="snyder12"/&gt;

The first version of the story itself is traceable to the Buddhist text ''Udana 6.4'', dated to about mid 1st millennium BCE. According to John Ireland, the parable is likely older than the Buddhist text.&lt;ref name="Ireland2007p9"&gt;{{cite book|author=John D. Ireland|title=Udana and the Itivuttaka: Two Classics from the Pali Canon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kIllG8k-OmIC |year=2007|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society|isbn=978-955-24-0164-0|pages=9, 81–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternate version of the parable describes normal men, experiencing a large statue on a dark night, or feeling a large object while being blindfolded. They then describe what it is they have experienced. In its various versions, it is a parable that has crossed between many religious traditions and is part of [[Buddhist]], [[Hindu]] and [[Jainism|Jain]] texts of 1st millennium CE or before.&lt;ref name="Griffiths2007p46"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul J.

The tale later became well known in Europe, with 19th century American poet [[John Godfrey Saxe]] creating [[s:The Blind Men and the Elephant|his own version]] as a poem, with a final verse that explains that the elephant is a metaphor for God, and the various blind men represent religions that disagree on something no one has fully experienced.&lt;ref name="Gardner1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Gardner|title=Famous Poems from Bygone Days|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTRorcYPLH0C&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=2012-08-25|date=1 September 1995|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-28623-5|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story has been published in many books for adults and children, and interpreted in a variety of ways.

==The parable==
{{anchor|The story}}
The earliest versions of the parable of blind men and elephant is found in Buddhist, Hindu and Jain texts, as they discuss the limits of perception and the importance of complete context. The parable has several Indian variations, but broadly goes as follows:&lt;ref name=goldstein492&gt;{{cite book|author=E. Bruce Goldstein|title=Encyclopedia of Perception|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6M3NSNm6MlkC&amp;pg=PA492|year=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-4081-8|page=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=snyder12&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.R. Snyder|author2=Carol E. Ford|title=Coping with Negative Life Events: Clinical and Social Psychological Perspectives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Bo7gBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12|year= 2013|publisher=Springer Science |isbn=978-1-4757-9865-4|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|A group of blind men heard that a strange animal, called an elephant, had been brought to the town, but none of them were aware of its shape and form. Out of curiosity, they said: "We must inspect and know it by touch, of which we are capable". So, they sought it out, and when they found it they groped about it. In the case of the first person, whose hand landed on the trunk, said "This being is like a thick snake". For another one whose hand reached its ear, it seemed like a kind of fan. As for another person, whose hand was upon its leg, said, the elephant is a pillar like a tree-trunk. The blind man who placed his hand upon its side said, "elephant is a wall". Another who felt its tail, described it as a rope. The last felt its tusk, stating the elephant is that which is hard, smooth and like a spear.}}

[[File:Illustrated proverb- Blind men and an elephant.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The blind men and the elephant &lt;br /&gt; (wall relief in Northeast Thailand)]]
In some versions, the blind men then discover their disagreements, suspect the others to be not telling the truth and come to blows. The stories also differ primarily in how the elephant's body parts are described, how violent the conflict becomes and how (or if) the conflict among the men and their perspectives is resolved. In some versions, they stop talking, start listening and collaborate to "see" the full elephant. In another, a sighted man enters the parable and describes the entire elephant from various perspectives, the blind men then learn that they were all partially correct and partially wrong. While one's subjective experience is true, it may not be the totality of truth.&lt;ref name="Ireland2007p9"/&gt;&lt;ref name=goldstein492/&gt;

The parable has been used to illustrate a range of truths and [[fallacies]]; broadly, the parable implies that one's subjective experience can be true, but that such experience is inherently limited by its failure to account for other truths or a totality of truth. At various times the parable has provided insight into the relativism, opaqueness or inexpressible nature of truth, the behavior of experts in fields of contradicting theories, the need for deeper understanding, and respect for different perspectives on the same object of observation.

==Hinduism==
The ''Rigveda'', dated to have been composed between 1500 and 1200 BCE, states "Reality is one, though wise men speak of it variously." According to Paul J. Griffiths, this premise is the foundation of universalist perspective behind the parable of the blind men and an elephant. The hymn asserts that the same reality is subject to interpretations and described in various ways by the wise.&lt;ref name="Griffiths2007p46"/&gt; In the oldest version, four blind men walk into a forest where they meet an elephant. In this version, they do not fight with each other, but conclude that they each must have perceived a different beast although they experienced the same elephant.&lt;ref name="Griffiths2007p46"/&gt; The expanded version of the parable occurs in various ancient and Hindu texts. Many scholars refer to it as a Hindu parable.&lt;ref name=goldstein492/&gt;&lt;ref name=snyder12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[a] {{cite book|author=Chad Meister|title=Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1egYDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11 |year=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-31475-8|pages=11–12}};&lt;br&gt;[b] {{cite book|author1=Jeremy P.

The parable or references appear in ''[[bhasya]]'' (commentaries, secondary literature) in the Hindu traditions. For example, [[Adi Shankara]] mentions it in his ''bhasya'' on verse 5.18.1 of the ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]'' as follows:

{{Quote|

==Jainism==
[[File:Medieval Jain temple Anekantavada doctrine artwork.jpg|thumb|left|Seven blind men and an elephant parable at a Jain temple]]
The medieval era Jain texts explain the concepts of ''[[anekāntavāda]]'' (or "many-sidedness") and ''[[Anekantavada#Sy.C4.81dv.C4.81da|syādvāda]]'' ("conditioned viewpoints") with the [[parable]] of the blind men and an elephant (''Andhgajanyāyah''), which addresses the manifold nature of truth. For example, this parable are found in ''Tattvarthaslokavatika'' of [[Vidyananda (8th-century Jain monk)|Vidyanandi]] (9th century) and ''Syādvādamanjari'' of Ācārya Mallisena (13th century). Mallisena uses the parable to argue that immature people deny various aspects of truth; deluded by the aspects they ''do'' understand, they deny the aspects they ''don't'' understand. "Due to extreme delusion produced on account of a partial viewpoint, the immature deny one aspect and try to establish another. This is the maxim of the blind (men) and the elephant."&lt;ref&gt;Mallisena, ''Syādvādamanjari'', 14:103–104. Dhruva, A.B. (1933) pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Mallisena also cites the parable when noting the importance of considering all viewpoints in obtaining a full  picture of reality. "It is impossible to properly understand an entity consisting of infinite properties without the method of modal description consisting of all viewpoints, since it will otherwise lead to a situation of seizing mere sprouts (i.e., a superficial, inadequate cognition), on the maxim of the blind (men) and the elephant."&lt;ref&gt;Mallisena, ''Syādvādamanjari'',  19:75–77. Dhruva, A.B. (1933) pp. 23–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
[[File:Blind monks examining an elephant.jpg|right|thumb|380px|''Blind monks examining an elephant'', an [[ukiyo-e]] print by [[Hanabusa Itchō]] (1652–1724).]]
[[Gautama Buddha|The Buddha]] twice uses the simile of blind men led astray. The earliest known version occurs in the text ''[[Udana]] 6.4''.&lt;ref name="Ireland2007p9"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gomez | first=Luis O. | title=Proto-Madhyamika in the Pali Canon | journal=Philosophy East and West | publisher=Univ of Hawaii Press | volume=26 | issue=2 | year=1976 | doi=10.2307/1398186 | page=164 note 73; 137–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Canki Sutta'' he describes a row of blind men holding on to each other as an example of those who follow an old text that has passed down from generation to generation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.095x.than.html Accesstoinsight.org]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628152156/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.095x.than.html |date=2006-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Udana]] (68–69)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.katinkahesselink.net/tibet/blind-men-elephant.html Katinkahesselink.net]&lt;/ref&gt; he uses the elephant parable to describe sectarian quarrels. A king has the blind men of the capital brought to the palace, where an elephant is brought in and they are asked to describe it.

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the blind men had each felt a part of the elephant, the king went to each of them and said to each: 'Well, blind man, have you seen the elephant? Tell me, what sort of thing is an elephant?'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The men assert the elephant is either like a pot (the blind man who felt the elephant's head), a [[winnowing|winnowing basket]] (ear), a [[plowshare]] (tusk), a [[plow]] (trunk), a [[granary]] (body), a [[Column|pillar]] (foot), a [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] (back), a [[pestle]] (tail) or a brush (tip of the tail).

The men cannot agree with one another and come to blows over the question of what it is like and their dispute delights the king. The Buddha ends the story by comparing the blind men to preachers and scholars who are blind and ignorant and hold to their own views: "Just so are these preachers and scholars holding various views blind and unseeing.... In their ignorance they are by nature quarrelsome, wrangling, and disputatious, each maintaining reality is thus and thus." The Buddha then speaks the following verse:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;O how they cling and wrangle, some who claim

==Sufism==
[[File:Blind men and elephant4.jpg|thumb|Blind men and the elephant.]]
The [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Sufi]] [[poet]] [[Sanai]] of [[Ghazni]] (currently, [[Afghanistan]]) presented this [[teaching story]] in his ''The Walled Garden of Truth''.&lt;ref&gt;Included in [[Idries Shah]], ''[[Tales of the Dervishes]]'' {{ISBN|0-900860-47-2}} [[Octagon Press]] 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rumi]], the 13th Century Persian poet and teacher of Sufism, included it in his [[Masnavi]]. In his retelling, "The Elephant in the Dark", some Hindus bring an elephant to be exhibited in a dark room. A number of men touch and feel the elephant in the dark and, depending upon where they touch it, they believe the elephant to be like a water spout (trunk), a fan (ear), a pillar (leg) and a throne (back). Rumi uses this story as an example of the limits of individual perception:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The sensual eye is just like the palm of the hand. The palm has not the means of covering the whole of the beast.&lt;ref name="Rumi"&gt;{{cite web |title=71 – The Elephant in the dark, on the reconciliation of contrarieties |url=http://www.khamush.com/tales_from_masnavi.htm#The%20Elephant |work=Rumi – Tales from Masnavi |date=2004-05-09 |first=A.J. |last= Arberry |accessdate=2006-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rumi does not present a resolution to the conflict in his version, but states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The eye of the Sea is one thing and the foam another. Let the foam go, and gaze with the eye of the Sea. Day and night foam-flecks are flung from the sea: oh amazing! You behold the foam but not the Sea. We are like boats dashing together; our eyes are darkened, yet we are in clear water.&lt;ref name="Rumi" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rumi ends his poem by stating "If each had a candle and they went in together the differences would disappear." &lt;ref&gt;For an adaptation of Rumi's poem, see this song version by David Wilcox [http://davidwilcox.com/index.php?page=songs&amp;display=1998&amp;category=Out_Beyond_Ideas here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009233459/http://davidwilcox.com/index.php?page=songs&amp;display=1998&amp;category=Out_Beyond_Ideas |date=October 9, 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==John Godfrey Saxe==
One of the most famous versions of the 19th century was the poem "[[s:The Blind Men and the Elephant|The Blind Men and the Elephant]]" by [[John Godfrey Saxe]] (1816–1887).
[[File:Blind men and elephant3.jpg|right|thumb|350px|
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;And so these men of Indostan&lt;ul&gt;Disputed loud and long,&lt;/ul&gt;Each in his own opinion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;Exceeding stiff and strong,&lt;/ul&gt;Though each was partly in the right&lt;ul&gt;And all were in the wrong!&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}]]
The poem begins:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;It was six men of Indostan
    To learning much inclined,
Who went to see the Elephant
    (Though all of them were blind),
That each by observation
    Might satisfy his mind&lt;ref name=Saxe&gt;{{cite wikisource|plaintitle=The poems of John Godfrey Saxe|chapter=The Blind Men and the Elephant|last=Saxe|first=John Godfrey|authorlink=John Godfrey Saxe|wspage=260|scan=Page:The poems of John Godfrey Saxe.djvu/279}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Each in his own opinion concludes that the elephant is like a wall, snake, spear, tree, fan or rope, depending upon where they had touched. Their heated debate comes short of physical violence, but the conflict is never resolved.
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
    '''Moral:'''
So oft in theologic wars,
    The disputants, I ween,
Rail on in utter ignorance
    Of what each other mean,
And prate about an Elephant
    Not one of them has seen!&lt;/poem&gt;}}

[[Natalie Merchant]] sang this poem in full on her [[Leave Your Sleep]] album (Disc 1, track 13).

== The meaning as proverb by country or domain ==
=== Japan ===
In Japan, the proverb is used as a simile of circumstance that ordinary men often fail to understand a great man or his great work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=日本国語大辞典|last=|first=|work=小学館国語辞典編集部|publisher=小学館|year=2001-04-20|isbn=4-09-521004-4|edition=2|volume=4 きかく～けんう|location=Tokyo|pages=1188|language=ja|chapter=群盲象を評す}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern treatments==
The story is seen as a [[metaphor]] in many disciplines, being pressed into service as an [[analogy]] in fields well beyond the traditional. In [[physics]], it has been seen as an analogy for the [[wave–particle duality]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9DWim3RhymsC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=wave+particle+duality+elephant+blind+men&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6G_1s_oA6v&amp;sig=UaEauX5CaISP-azpgp0NXQCRwU0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YYaOS7WbOKf20gSH8-zmDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CA0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=wave%20particle%20duality%20elephant%20blind%20men&amp;f=false ''Quantum theory''] by David Bohm, p. 26. Retrieved 2010-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[biology]], the way the blind men hold onto different parts of the elephant has been seen as a good analogy for the [[Polyclonal B cell response]].&lt;ref&gt;See for instance ''The lymph node in HIV pathogenesis'' by Michael M. Lederman and Leonid Margolis, ''Seminars in Immunology'', Volume 20, Issue 3, June 2008, pp. 187–195.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Blind men and elephant.png|thumb|"Blind men and elephant", &lt;small&gt;from Martha Adelaide Holton &amp; Charles Madison Curry, ''Holton-Curry readers''&lt;/small&gt;, 1914.]]The fable is one of a number of tales that cast light on the response of hearers or readers to the story itself. [[Idries Shah]] has commented on this element of [[self-reference]] in the many interpretations of the story, and its function as a [[teaching stories|teaching story]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...people address themselves to this story in one or more [...] interpretations. They then accept or reject them. Now they can feel happy; they have arrived at an opinion about the matter. According to their conditioning they produce the answer. Now look at their answers. Some will say that this is a fascinating and touching allegory of the presence of God. Others will say that it is showing people how stupid mankind can be. Some say it is anti-scholastic. Others that it is just a tale copied by Rumi from Sanai – and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idriesshah.info/Shah/ShahTeaStor.htm |title=The Teaching Story: Observations on the Folklore of Our "Modern" Thought |first=Idries |last=Shah |accessdate=2010-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shah adapted the tale in his book ''[[The Dermis Probe]]''. This version begins with a conference of scientists, from different fields of expertise, presenting their conflicting conclusions on the material upon which a camera is focused. As the camera slowly zooms out it gradually becomes clear that the material under examination is the hide of an African elephant. The words 'The Parts Are Greater Than The Whole' then appear on the screen. This retelling formed the script for a short four-minute film by the animator [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]]. The film was chosen as an Outstanding Film of the Year and was exhibited at the London and New York film festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.octagonpress.com/titles/books/depr.htm Octagon Press page for The Dermis Probe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726115510/http://www.octagonpress.com/titles/books/depr.htm |date=July 26, 2011 }}, with preview of story&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockethouse.co.uk/Elephant/|title=touching the elephant|publisher=The Rockethouse|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story enjoys a continuing appeal, as shown by the number of illustrated children's books of the fable; there is one for instance by [[Paul Galdone]] and another, ''Seven Blind Mice'', by [[Ed Young (illustrator)|Ed Young]] (1992).

In the title cartoon of one of his books, cartoonist [[Sam Gross]] postulated that one of the blind men, encountering a pile of the elephant feces, concluded that "An elephant is soft and mushy."

An [[elephant joke]] inverts the story in the following way:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Six blind elephants were discussing what men were like. After arguing they decided to find one and determine what it was like by direct experience. The first blind elephant felt the man and declared, 'Men are flat.' After the other blind elephants felt the man, they agreed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12493">The '''Brittle Books Program''' is an initiative carried out by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] at the request of the United States Congress. The initiative began officially between 1988 and 1989 with the intention to involve the eventual [[microform|microfilming]] of over 3 million endangered volumes.

== Purpose ==
In the beginning half of the 20th century it became apparent that the use of acidic [[wood-pulp paper]], common since the 1850s, was causing paper materials to slowly burn. This has been referred to as the [[slow fire]]. A statement submitted to the House of Representatives estimated that there were 80 million brittle books in North American libraries, 12 million of which were unique titles. As [[mass deacidification]] efforts proved costly and inconsistent, librarians and archivists began looking for more practical ways to preserve the intellectual content of the decaying material. Microfilm, one of the most stable and durable mediums around at the time, was decided to be the most reasonable alternative.

== Timeline ==
*1987 - A subcommittee of the House of Representatives during the 100th Congress (1st session) addressed the problem of "brittle books in our nation's libraries."
*March 17, 1988 - [[Patricia Battin]], president of the Commission on Preservation and Access (CPA), testified before the U.S. House of Representatives' Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies (Committee on Appropriations).  She proposed a collaborative approach to the preservation of the nation's brittle books and asked the House to increase federal funding for preservation microfilming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nhalliance.org/testimony/1988/88testimony-pbattin.html# |title=NHA Testimony: Patricia M.

*October, 1988 - An appropriations bill for fiscal year 1989 gave the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] $12.5 million. Eight million dollars of that sum went to instituting a twenty-year program for the microfilming of endangered volumes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/timeline.html Timeline&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*1995 - The program was assessed to be on schedule and 25% complete.{{Citation needed|reason=who assessed the program?|date=August 2009}}
*Roughly 50,000 brittle and endangered volumes are microfilmed each year.

==Important figures==
[[William Barrow (chemist)|William Barrow]] was a pioneer conservator in the [[library science]] field. He connected the paper strength or lack thereof (brittle paper)to the acidity of the groundwood used to make [[wood pulp]] after the 1850s.&lt;ref name="paper"&gt;.{{cite web |author1=Timoth Barrett |author2=Cynthia Mosier |year=1994 |url=http://aic.stanford.edu/sg/bpg/annual/v13/bp13-02.html|title=The Role of Gelatin in Paper Permanency II|publisher=American Institute for Conservation.}}The Book and Paper Annual vol.13&lt;/ref&gt; 
With his own observations of his collection and tests conducted, he announced to the library community that acid deterioration begins to show signs after 20,40 and 80 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrow|first1=William J.|title=Permanence/Durability of the book-VI: Spot testing for unstable modern book and record papers.|date=1969|publisher=W.

== Structure ==
As with other [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] programs, the Brittle Books Program is a partnership program, meaning that qualifying institutions must apply for grants in order to participate. Should the institution be accepted, they are required to share at least 33% of the program's costs. Unlike other [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] preservation funding initiatives, the Brittle Books program does require that an institution in each state must be awarded a grant. The projects are largely run at the state level with the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] providing methodologies, assuring a standard level of quality, and connecting the efforts of the various institutions. To be awarded a grant as part of the Brittle Books Program, institutions were required to abide by five basic conditions:
*1. That they abide by the national standard
*2. That they create three copies of all material: a master negative, a print negative, and a service copy
*3. That a record adhering to national standards be entered into a national bibliographic database
*4. That interlibrary loan copies be readily available
*5. That storage conditions meet that of the national standard&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nhalliance.org/testimony/1995/95testimony-pbattin.html# |title=NHA Testimony: Patricia M.

== Preservation issues ==

===Deacidification===
While there is a deacidification&lt;ref&gt;[[Mass deacidification]]&lt;/ref&gt; method that can successfully lower the acidity in brittle books, many public libraries do not have the funding to implement standard programs to halt the deterioration taking place in these institutions.  Some repositories have the resources to send books for a deacidification wash in stages.

Deacidification washes are usually a viable option for most repositories as books can be sent in bulk; however, only books of excellent physical quality may be sent.  The wash process is rather aggressive and any deformities in a book may cause damage to already brittle specimens.  Therefore, libraries would have to first repair those books in less than desirable condition - specifically elements of the binding, leaf attachments, and text attachments - before deacidification.  These extra conservation efforts would increase the costs of deacidification.

===Paper splitting===
Another option to preserve brittle books is to perform [[paper splitting]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/preserv/papertreng.html MDEP Paper Strengthening Pilot Program 2003-2005 (Preservation, Library of Congress)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526155014/http://www.loc.gov/preserv/papertreng.html |date=May 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process dissects a book by its leaf and text attachment and treats each sheet of paper individually.  Supervised by a book conservator, a paper conservator, and a conservation specialist, pages are literally pulled apart - fronts from backs - and a piece of alkaline paper is placed in between.  The acid pages are then sandwiched back together with a non-acid buffer between them to slow the deterioration process.  However, only ZFB (the Zentrum für Bucherhaltung)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zfb.com/en_version.php Mass Deacidification and Conservation for Libraries, Archives and Museums from one source&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; offers this procedure (also called mechanical paper splitting).  They claim the process is so refined, they have successfully split cigarette paper. Washes will de-acidify the paper though they will remain brittle; but paper splitting increases the strength and flexibility of the paper via the extra new sheet of buffered paper and the ZFB process includes de-acidification washes.&lt;ref&gt;Brückle, I. and Dambrogio, J.[http://aic.stanford.edu/jaic/articles/jaic39-03-001_indx.html "Paper splitting: History and modern technology"] "[[Journal of the American Institute for Conservation]]", 2000.  Retrieved on 2008-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bansa, H. and Ishii, R. [https://www.uni-muenster.de/Forum-Bestandserhaltung/downloads/pfest-bansa.pdf "The Effect of Different Strengthening Methods on Different Kinds of Paper"]. "[[Restaurator]]", 1997. Retrieved on 2008-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liers, L., Wächter, W., and Müller, G. "Results of the paper splitting process." "[[Restaurator]]",1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microform===
Microform is a reasonable option for Brittle Book preservation mainly because microfilm can be usable for 500 years, so long as it is stored in proper conditions and a microfilm reader is accessible.  Even [[microform|microfiche]] is easier to store than microfilm, provided organizational practices prevent the divestment of sheets from their filing system. Despite its proven record of durability, microform is no longer a preferred method of digitization because it lacks the accessibility that modern electronic digitization provides.

===Digitization===
Digital conversion of physical items is the preferred method, despite an estimated five-year longevity for most computer files.  As proper archival-quality digitization requires use of large, uncompressed [[TIFF]] files, storage can be a significant cost, especially for public libraries. Moreover, copyright law restrains the ability to digitize all brittle books. While the library is authorized to make a copy of a book it cannot obtain through reasonable means, having a digital copy offers the possibility of unauthorized distribution if circulated in this format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/byauth/oakley/brittle.html Copyright and Preservation-Brittle Books Preservation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photocopies===
Many repositories, such as the University of Kansas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.ku.edu/preservation/BrittleBooks.shtml KU Libraries: Brittle Books Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723190614/http://www.lib.ku.edu/preservation/BrittleBooks.shtml |date=July 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; opt for preservation-quality photocopies.  A list-serv&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.ku.edu/preservation/Brittle.shtml KU Libraries: Brittle Books Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903072543/http://www.lib.ku.edu/preservation/Brittle.shtml |date=September 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is utilized for the posting of titles so a consortium of libraries can benefit from a reduced cost in replication so they may maintain their circulating collections.  Maintained by OCLC, the submissions are processed at the OCLC Preservation Service Center and OCLC retains the digital copies produced as to defer any copyright issues away from the repositories subscribing to the service.

== Future ==
As libraries move into the digital era, preservation practices attempt to move with them. Current and future projects in preserving brittle volumes are more likely to involve scanning and digitization than microfilming. A recent example of such a program is the ''Digitizing America's Imprints'' project at the [[Library of Congress]] which received a $2 million grant in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2007-02-01-digitizing-brittle-books_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=A $2M grant will digitize brittle books | date=2007-02-01 | accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Caravaggio to Canaletto" is the title of a temporary exhibition in the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]], [[Budapest]]. It's open from 26 October 2013 until 16 February 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homepage of the Caravaggio to Canaletto exhibition in Museum of Fine Arts|url=http://www.szepmuveszeti.hu/exhibitions/caravaggio-to-canaletto-1015|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing 140 artworks by 100 masters from the Museum of Fine Arts, other collections from abroad and private collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.budapesttimes.hu/2013/11/08/car%C2%ADavaggio-to-canaletto/ Caravaggio to Canaletto]&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition provides a panoramic view of the era from the end of the 16th century until 1760 in Italy: it treats the effect of [[Caravaggio]] on the [[Italian Baroque|Italian Baroque painting]], and shows the way towards [[Roccoco]], [[Classicism]] and [[Realism (arts)|Realism]]. It presents the most popular genres from the Biblical themes through [[still life]]s to [[Capriccio (art)|capriccios]]. It's composed of the following sections, generally in temporary order:

1. Face-to-face With Reality: Caravaggio's early paintings, and popular themes in [[Caravaggism]]

2. Divine Light - Diabolic Shadow: Biblical themes, life of [[Jesus]] and other saints, scenes from the [[Old Testament]]

3. Ideal and Norm: classicising ambitions by [[Guido Reni]] and his followers

4. Eloquence, Illusion, Splendour: monumental Baroque Biblical themes

5. Natura Morta - Natura Viva: new tendencies in still lifes and portraits - from [[trompe l'oeil]] to social portraiture

6. Poetry and Virtuosity in the Settecento: from the Classicism and Roccoco to "almost [[Biedermeier]]"

7. Swansong in Venice: from the most monumental religious paintings to the scenes of everyday life

8. Italian Journey: Astonishing [[veduta]]s of Venice by [[Canaletto]] and his followers, closing the exhibition with the best-known [[Capriccio (art)|capriccio]].

'''Chicken Little''', also known as '''Henny Penny''' and sometimes as '''Chicken Licken''', is a European [[Folklore|folk tale]] with a moral in the form of a [[cumulative tale]] about a [[chicken]] who believes the world is coming to an end. The phrase {{nowrap|"'''The sky is falling!'''"}} featured prominently in the story, and has passed into the English language as a common idiom indicating a [[Hysteria|hysterical]] or mistaken belief that disaster is imminent. Versions of the story go back more than 25 centuries;&lt;ref name="Jataka"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/kawasaki/bl142.html#jat322|title=Jataka Tales of the Buddha, Part III, retold by Ken &amp; Visakha Kawasaki|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; it continues to be referred to in a variety of media.

==The story and its name==
[[File:Henny penny.JPG|thumb|right|upright-1.3|Illustration for the story "Chicken Little", 1916]]
The story is listed as [[Aarne-Thompson classification system|Aarne-Thompson-Uther]] type 20C, which includes international examples of folktales that make light of paranoia and mass hysteria.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20000620145435/http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type2033.html The End of the World The Sky Is Falling, folktales of Aarne-Thompson-Uther type 20C (including former type 2033), in which storytellers from around the world make light of paranoia and mass hysteria]'', selected and edited by [[D. L. Ashliman]], 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  
There are several Western versions of the story, of which the best-known concerns a chick that believes the sky is falling when an [[acorn]] falls on its head. The chick decides to tell the King and on its journey meets other animals (mostly other fowl) which join it in the quest. After this point, there are many endings. In the most familiar, a fox invites them to its lair and then eats them all. Alternatively, the last one, usually Cocky Lockey, survives long enough to warn the chick, who escapes. In others all are rescued and finally speak to the King.

In most retellings, the animals have rhyming names, commonly Chicken Licken or Chicken Little, Henny Penny or Hen-Len, Cocky Locky, Ducky Lucky or Ducky Daddles, Drakey Lakey, Goosey Loosey or Goosey Poosey, Gander Lander, Turkey Lurkey and Foxy Loxy or Foxy Woxy.

The [[moral]] to be drawn changes, depending on the version. Where there is a "happy ending", the moral is not to be a "Chicken" but to have courage. In other versions where the birds are eaten by the fox, the fable is interpreted as a warning not to believe everything one is told.

In the [[United States]], the most common name for the story is "Chicken Little", as attested by illustrated books for children dating from the early 19th century. In Britain and its other former colonies, it is best known as "Henny Penny" and "Chicken Licken", titles by which it also went in the United States.{{#tag:ref|Before Lightnin' Hopkins' "Henny Penny Blues" from the 1940s, there was a 1906 comic strip version.&lt;ref&gt;C365 in the Opie Collection.

Retrieved 1 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent instance is the Golden Girls' TV skit titled [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEHNtqFt9Ck "Henny Penny"] (1991). ''The Yale Book of Quotations'' cites the nursery tale "Chicken Licken" as the source for 'the sky is falling' and the character is mentioned in [[John Cheever]]'s short story [http://members.multimania.co.uk/shortstories/cheeverfivefortyeight.html "The 5.48".]|group=note}}

==History==
[[File:Kylling Kluk.png|thumb|250px|"There was once a little chick named Kluk": beginning of the 1823 Danish version of the story.]]

The story was part of the oral folk tradition and only began to appear in print after the [[Brothers Grimm]] had set a European example with their collection of German tales in the early years of the 19th century. One of the earliest to collect tales from Scandinavian sources was [[Just Mathias Thiele]], who in 1823 published an early version of the Henny Penny story in the [[Danish language]].&lt;ref name="thiele"&gt;{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The names of the characters there are Kylling Kluk,&lt;ref name="kylling_kluk"&gt;''Kylling'' means "chick" (baby chicken); ''Kluk'' is an onomatopoeic representation of a chicken's vocalization, similar to English "cluck"&lt;/ref&gt; Høne Pøne,&lt;ref name="hone_pone"&gt;''Høne'' means "hen"; ''Pøne'' means "penny"&lt;/ref&gt; Hane Pane,&lt;ref name="hane_pane"&gt;''Hane'' means "cock"/"rooster"&lt;/ref&gt; And Svand,&lt;ref name="and_svand"&gt;''And'' means "duck"&lt;/ref&gt; Gaase Paase,&lt;ref name="gaase_paase"&gt;''Gaase'' (modern Danish ''Gåse'') means "goose"&lt;/ref&gt; and Ræv Skræv.&lt;ref name="raev_skraev"&gt;''Ræv'' means "fox"&lt;/ref&gt; In Thiele's untitled account, a nut falls on Kylling Kluk's back and knocks him over. He then goes to each of the other characters, proclaiming that "I think all the world is falling" and setting them all running. The fox Ræv Skræv joins in the flight and, when they reach the wood, counts them over from behind and eats them one by one. Eventually the tale was translated into English by [[Benjamin Thorpe]] after several other versions had appeared.

Once the story began to appear in the English language, the titles by which they went varied considerably and have continued to do so. John Greene Chandler (1815-1879), an illustrator and wood engraver from [[Petersham, Massachusetts]], published an illustrated children's book titled ''The Remarkable Story of Chicken Little'' in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Remarkable Story of Chicken Little |last=Chandler |first=John Greene |year=1840 |location=Roxbury, MA |publisher=J.G.

[[File:Chicken Little 1 2.png|thumb|250px|First two pages of the 1840 children's illustrated book: ''The Remarkable Story of Chicken Little'']]
A [[Scots language|Scots]] version of the tale is found in [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|
Robert Chambers]]'s ''Popular Rhymes, Fireside Stories, and Amusements of Scotland'' of 1842.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Popular Rhymes, Fireside Stories, and Amusements of Scotland |first=Robert |last=Chambers |year=1842 |location=Edinburgh |publisher=William and Robert Chambers |oclc=316602150 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5dpWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA51 |pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It appeared among the "Fireside Nursery Stories" and was titled "The hen and her fellow travellers". The characters included Henny Penny, Cocky Locky, Ducky Daddles, Goosie Poosie, and an unnamed "tod" (fox). Henny Penny became convinced that "the lifts were faun" (the heavens were falling) when a pea fell on her head.

In 1849, a "very different" English version was published under the title "The Story of Chicken-Licken" by Joseph Orchard Halliwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James Orchard |last=Halliwell |title=Popular rhymes and nursery tales: a sequel to the Nursery rhymes of England |year=1849 |location=London |publisher=John Russell Smith |oclc=3155930 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F0P4O6K5zIAC |pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this Chicken-licken was startled when "an acorn fell on her bald pate" and encounters the characters Hen-len, Cock-lock, Duck-luck, Drake-lake, Goose-loose, Gander-lander, Turkey-lurkey and Fox-lox.

It was followed in 1850 by "The wonderful story of Henny Penny" in Joseph Cundall's compilation, ''The Treasury of pleasure books for young children''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GeMqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PT94&amp;dq=%22Henny%20Penny%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ryChVOGSJouqU8O5gaAL&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Henny%20Penny%22&amp;f=false|title=The Treasury of pleasure books for young children|date=1 January 1850|publisher=W.G. Baker|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each story there is presented as if it were a separate book, and in this case had two illustrations by [[Harrison Weir]]. In reality the story is a repetition of the Chambers narration in standard English, except that the dialect phrase "so she gaed, and she gaed, and she gaed" is retained and the cause of panic is mistranslated as "the clouds are falling".

Benjamin Thorpe's translation of Thiele's Danish story was published in 1853 and given the title "The Little Chicken Kluk and his companions"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Yule-Tide Stories: a collection of Scandinavian and North German popular tales and traditions

|pages=421–422
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thorpe describes the tale there as "a pendant to the Scottish story…printed in Chambers" (see above) and gives the characters approximately the same names as in Chambers.

Comparing the different versions, we find that in the Scots and English stories the animals want "to tell the king" that the skies are falling; while in the American story, as in the Danish, they are not given any specific motivation. In all versions they are eaten by the fox, although in different circumstances.

==Idiomatic usage==
[[File:Chicken Little Title.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''The Remarkable Story of Chicken Little'']]
The name "Chicken Little"&amp;nbsp;— and the fable's central phrase, ''The sky is falling!''&amp;nbsp;— have been applied to people accused of being unreasonably afraid, or those trying to incite an unreasonable fear in those around them.

The first use of the name "Chicken Little" to "one who warns of or predicts calamity, especially without justification" recorded by the [[Merriam-Webster]] [[Dictionary]] is in 1895,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TAnheeIPcAEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA213&amp;lpg=RA1-PA213&amp;dq=chicken+little+++%221895%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=38-iJ3YjV3&amp;sig=cwSqhSKst9G4G0eqSsVwlDsfDSg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wcdLTdvYOoiChQfelPWsDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=chicken%20little%20%20%20%221895%22&amp;f=false|title=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but idiomatic use of the name significantly predates that attestation. In fact, this usage is recorded in the United States very soon after the publication of Chandler's illustrated children's book in 1840.  Already, in 1842, a journal article about the [[Government of Haiti]] referred to "Chicken Little" in an offhand manner.&lt;ref&gt;"Life in Hayti", in {{cite book |title=The Knickerbocker, or New York monthly magazine, volume xix |location=New York |publisher=John Bisco |year=1842 |url=https://archive.org/details/knickerbockeror89unkngoog/page/n462 |pages=454}}:  "In the words of an infantile philosopher, yclept 'Chicken Little', how can he ''help'' knowing it?"&lt;/ref&gt;  An "oration" delivered to the city of Boston on [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4]], 1844, contains the passage:  {{quote|To hear their harangues on the eve of the election, one would suppose that the fable of Chicken Little was about to become a truth, and that the sky was actually falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Morals of Freedom: An Oration delivered Before the Authorities of the City of Boston July 4, 1844 |author=Chandler | first=Peleg W. |location=Boston, MA |publisher=John H. Eastburn |oclc=982157 |pages=29 |url=https://archive.org/details/moralsoffreedomo00chan/page/28}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Fear mongering]]&amp;nbsp;— whether justified or not&amp;nbsp;— can sometimes elicit a societal response called ''Chicken Little syndrome'', described as "inferring catastrophic conclusions possibly resulting in paralysis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last = Landry | first = John R. | citeseerx = 10.1.1.108.2917 | title = Can Mission Statements Plant the "Seeds" of Dysfunctional Behaviors in an Organization's Memory? in Proceedings of the Thirty-First Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences | page = 169 | year = 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been defined as "a sense of despair or passivity which blocks the audience from actions".&lt;ref&gt;Li, Xinghua, [http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1884&amp;context=etd "Communicating the "incommunicable green": a comparative study of the structures of desire in environmental advertising in the United States and China"], PhD diss., p.81, University of Iowa, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The term began appearing in the 1950s&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://books.google.com/books?id=AJssAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22chicken+little+syndrome%22&amp;dq=%22chicken+little+syndrome%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dvpjTb6IF5L4sAONu6DBCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBDjSAQ Audio Visual Communication Review], v.3-4, pp. 226-227, National Education Association of the United States Dept. of Audiovisual Instruction, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; and the phenomenon has been noted in many different societal contexts.

==Adaptations==
[[Walt Disney Pictures]] has made two animated versions of the story. The first was ''[[Chicken Little (1943 film)|Chicken Little]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Walt Disney (1943), available [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vnp4kj5lLOU at Youtube]&lt;/ref&gt; a 1943 [[animated short]] released during [[World War II]] as one of a series produced at the request of the U.S. government for the purpose of discrediting [[Nazism]]. It tells a variant of the parable in which Foxy Loxy takes the advice of a book on psychology (on the original 1943 cut, it is ''[[Mein Kampf]]'') by striking the least intelligent first. Dim-witted Chicken Little is convinced by him that the sky is falling and whips the farmyard into [[mass hysteria]], which the unscrupulous fox manipulates for his own benefit. The dark comedy is used as an allegory for the idea that fear-mongering weakens the war effort and costs lives. It is also one of the versions of the story in which Chicken Little appears as a character distinct from Henny Penny.

The second Disney film was the very loosely adapted ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]'', released in 2005 as a 3D [[computer animation|computer-animated]] feature. It is an updated [[science fiction]] sequel to the original fable in which Chicken Little is partly justified in his fears. In this version, Foxy Loxy is changed from a male to a female, and from the main antagonist to a local bully. Another film adaptation was the animated TV episode "Henny Penny" (1999), which was part of the series ''[[Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child]]''. In this modern update, the story is given a satirical and political interpretation. 

There have also been a number of musical settings. American composer [[Vincent Persichetti]] used the fable as the plot of his only opera ''The Sibyl: A Parable of Chicken Little'' (Parable XX), op. 135 (1976), which premiered in 1985. On the [[sitcom]] ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', there was a 1991 episode in which the characters perform a short musical based on the fable (here titled "Henny Penny") at a school recital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEHNtqFt9Ck|title=Henny Penny|work=YouTube|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, there was Joy Chaitin and Sarah Stevens-Estabrook's equally light-hearted musical version of the fable, "Henny Penny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sRx_Mf-0fh0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22henny+penny%22++musical&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QM1wQDgvNd&amp;sig=U6pH-Bmv1I2H886UonGifWrevkY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6XIwTLrZAYju0wThpMWWAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22henny%20penny%22%20%20musical&amp;f=false|title=Henny Penny: A Play with Optional Music|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed for between six and a hundred junior actors, it has additional characters as optional extras: Funky Monkey, Sheepy Weepy, Mama Llama, Pandy Handy and Giraffy Laughy (plus an aggressive oak-tree).

In Singapore, a more involved musical was performed in 2005. This was Brian Seward's '' The Acorn - the true story of Chicken Licken''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsS/seward-brian.html|title=Brian Seward - Playwright|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a tale of mixed motivations as certain creatures (including some among the 'good guys') take advantage of the panic caused by Chicken Licken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us-1Gq0_5UU|title=The True Story of Chicken Licken|work=YouTube|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 American singer and composer [[Gary Bachlund]] set the text of Margaret Free's reading version of "Chicken Little" (''The Primer'', 1910) for high voice and piano. In his note to the score Bachlund makes it clear that he intends a reference to alarmism and its tragic consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bachlund.org/Chicken_Little.htm|title=Chicken Little (2007), Margaret Free and Harriette Taylor Treadwell, originally for high voice and piano|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular references==
There are many novels, films, CDs and songs titled "The Sky is Falling", but the majority refer to the idiomatic use of the phrase rather than to the fable from which it derives. The following are some lyrics which genuinely refer or allude to the story:

* British band [[Happy Mondays]] have the lines "Henny Penny, Cocky Locky, Goosey Loosey, Turkey Lurkey, Ducky Lucky, Chicken Little, It seems they are all on the move when the sun is falling in" in the song "Moving in with" on their second album, ''Bummed'' (1986).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRZjWnlboBg|title=Happy Mondays - Moving In With|work=YouTube|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Aerosmith]] song "[[Livin' on the Edge]]" (1993) has the lines "If Chicken Little tells you that the sky is falling, Even if it wasn't would you still come crawling back again?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuCGiV-EVjA|title=Aerosmith - Livin' On The Edge (Lyrics)|work=YouTube|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Chicken Little" is a song from the 1997 album ''Fancy'', by the California avantrock band [[Idiot Flesh]]; it contains the line, "The sky is falling, gotta tell the king".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoZIACMcS2o|title=Idiot Flesh - Chicken Little|work=YouTube|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The Sky Is Falling" is a song by [[Owsley (musician)|Owsley]] from the 1999 debut album ''Owsley''; it includes the line "Chicken Little had a big day today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5b3J5FXazI|title="The Sky Is Falling" by The Semantics|work=YouTube|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related stories==
A very early example containing the basic motif and many of the elements of the tale is some 25 centuries old and appears in the Buddhist scriptures as the ''Daddabha [[Jataka]]'' (J 322).&lt;ref name="Jataka" /&gt; In it, [[the Buddha]], on hearing about some particular religious practices, comments that there is no special merit in them, but rather that they are "like the noise the hare heard." He then tells the story of a hare disturbed by a falling fruit who believes that the earth is coming to an end. The hare starts a stampede among the other animals until a lion halts them, investigates the cause of the panic and restores calm. The fable teaches the necessity for deductive reasoning and subsequent investigation.

The Tibetan version of the Jataka tale has been told in rhyme by Australian author [[Ursula Dubosarsky]] in her book ''The Terrible Plop'' (2009), which has since been dramatised, using the original title ''Plop!''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newvictory.org/show.m?showID=1034027 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511215004/http://www.newvictory.org/show.m?showID=1034027 |archivedate=2012-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, the animal stampede is halted by a bear, rather than a lion. The ending has been changed from the Tibetan original as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://weheartbooks.com/2009/04/23/the-terrible-plop |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226121408/http://weheartbooks.com/2009/04/23/the-terrible-plop/ |archivedate=2010-12-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There also exists a [[Br'er Rabbit]] story that is closer to the Eastern versions. In this story, Br'er Rabbit initiates the panic but does not take part in the mass flight, although Br'er Fox does. In this case it is Br'er [[Terrapin]] that leads the animals back to question Br'er Rabbit.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Chandler Harris, ''Nights with Uncle Remus: Myths and Legends of the Old Plantation'' (Boston and New York: Houghton, Mifflin, and Company, 1883), no. 20, pp. 108-13.

In the [[United Kingdom]] (and particularly in [[England and Wales]]) the term '''county record office''' usually refers to a local authority repository, also called a county [[archive]]s.

Such repositories employ specialist staff to administer and conserve the historic and the semi-current records of the parent body. They usually also preserve written materials from a great variety of independent local organisations, churches and schools, prominent families and their estates, businesses, solicitors' offices and ordinary private individuals. 

Archives may have been acquired either through donation or (more generally) by deposit on long-term loan. Local authorities in certain larger cities sometimes administer their own separate '''city record office''', operating along similar lines. Archive repositories are frequently – but by no means exclusively – used by local and family historians for the purposes of original research, since many records can very often have a continuing administrative or legal significance.

==Facilities==
A record office will typically include public searchrooms (including reference books, archive catalogues and other finding aids), environmentally controlled strongrooms, administrative offices, and quite often small exhibition areas&lt;ref&gt;The relevant British Standard for the storage and exhibition of archives, both on and off the premises, is [[BS 5454]].&lt;/ref&gt; together with a conservation room for the specialist repair&lt;ref&gt;The relevant British Standard for the conservation and repair of documents is BS 4971.&lt;/ref&gt; of documents. Searchrooms are generally open at their advertised times without charge, although many offices operate a reader's ticket system. Some, but not all, operate a fee-paying postal service for those who are unable to make personal research visits. All county record offices attempt to work in accordance with the appropriate official [[British Standard]].

==Historical development of the UK archive network==
[[File:Hampshire Record Office, Sussex Street - geograph.org.uk - 1214346.jpg|thumb|[[Hampshire Record Office]], Sussex Street, Winchester]] 
The earliest county record office in the modern sense was the [[Bedfordshire Record Office]], established by [[George Herbert Fowler]] in 1913. To some extent it was operating within established traditions set by the London-based [[Public Record Office]] (now [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]), which first opened in 1838, or by other repositories overseas. Although the statutory operation of such county record offices under the [[Local Government (Records) Act 1962]] was permissive rather than mandatory, the network has gradually expanded. Bristol Record Office (now [[Bristol Archives]]), opened in 1924, has been identified as the second local office to become established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristol.gov.uk/node/1295] Bristol Record Office website: "It was the first borough record office in the country and at the time there was only one other local record office in existence."  Retrieved 21 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The whole network now includes repositories – which operate largely independently of each other – throughout the whole of England and Wales (the most recent being Powys Archives, opened in the 1980s). Often the foundations of many of the earlier collections were the extensive surviving archives originating from a county's [[quarter session]]s – in the county of [[Somerset]] a special muniment room had actually been provided for these as early as 1617.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/AboutSRO.htm] Somerset Heritage Centre website – History of the Somerset Archive Service: "Somerset can claim a longer continuously-known history of official record keeping than any other county in England. A meeting of Quarter Sessions held at Wells in 1617 decided that a room should be provided 'for the safe keeping of the records of the Sessions'. By 1619 Somerset possessed not only its own record room, but also a room adjoining for the use of searchers. The record room stood next to the [[Chain Gate, Wells|Chain Gate]] on the north side of [[Wells Cathedral]], and remained in use for the next 200 years." Retrieved 21 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many broadly similar repositories in Scotland, Ireland, and overseas. To varying extents they will also help with the care of the county's semi-current or "modern records" using [[records management]] principles, as well as with the selection and preservation of today's records (both paper and digital) for future generations.

During the 19th and 20th centuries some older libraries had also begun to maintain archive collections from their local area, although their facilities and the scope of their collections could vary considerably – as  might their official legal status. There are often overlaps between local studies and record office collections, particularly with respect to printed ephemera, maps, photographs, old newspapers and local reference books. A number of record offices now operate in a formal association with one or more of their county’s principal local studies libraries, although the two professions of [[archivist]] and [[librarian]] generally remain quite distinct.

==Legal status for holding Public Records and other categories==

Public access to central government archives (technically known as '''Public Records''') and by extension to local government records was previously regulated in accordance with instruments such as the [[Public Records Act 1958]] and the [[Public Records Act 1967]]. The 1958 Act enabled county repositories to be appointed by the [[Lord Chancellor]] to hold individually specified classes of Public Records – including local court records.&lt;ref&gt;In practice any such appointments to hold Public Records (as defined by the 1958 Act), together with Manorial and Tithe records, are made on the recommendation of staff of the National Archives – formerly the Public Record Office – following inspections which can be repeated every few years.&lt;/ref&gt; Access to material within record  offices in England &amp; Wales is now largely regulated by the [[Data Protection Act 1998]] and the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]], although these do not necessarily cover privately deposited items, and closure periods may apply in certain cases.&lt;ref&gt;A summary of relevant legislation including the status of record offices was provided by Knightbridge A. A. H., ''Archive Legislation in the United Kingdom'' (Society of Archivists Information Leaflet, 1985), although this does not cover more recent changes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1929 many county record offices in England have also been designated by the local bishop as a [[diocesan record office]], latterly operating under the terms of the [[Parochial Registers and Records Measure 1978]]. Such record offices are often also formally recognised by the [[Master of the Rolls]] as approved repositories for manorial and tithe records (in accordance with the [[Law of Property Act 1922]] and the [[Tithe Act 1936]] (as amended by the [[Local Government Records Act 1962]]).&lt;ref&gt;HMSO: ''Record Repositories in Great Britain, a geographical directory'', 1992 {{ISBN|0-11-440243-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guides to the contents of record offices==

Many county record offices have issued printed guides to their collections, although the addition of new materials can make these go rapidly out of date. Furthermore, many offices also have considerable backlogs of uncatalogued materials. From the 1990s onwards an increasing number of offices have launched online catalogues of varying completeness, linked to their respective websites.

An earlier summary of archive repositories, including brief details of the development of each office together with outlines of their principal holdings, is provided by Janet Foster and Julia Sheppard’s ''British Archives'' (4th edition, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=British Archives: a guide to archive resources in the United Kingdom |editor1-first=Janet |editor1-last=Foster |editor2-first=Julia |editor2-last=Sheppard |edition=4th |location=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave |year=2002 |isbn=0333735366 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Select lists for certain specialised categories covering many UK repositories have also been issued by a variety of other publishers, notably the [[Federation of Family History Societies]].

"'''Crossing the Bar'''" is an 1889 poem by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]. It is considered that Tennyson wrote it in [[elegy]]; the poem has a tone of finality and the narrator uses an [[extended metaphor]] to compare death with crossing the "[[sandbar]]" between river of life, with its outgoing "flood", and the ocean that lies beyond [death], the "boundless deep", to which we return.

==Overview==
Tennyson is believed to have written the poem (after suffering a serious illness) while on the sea, crossing the [[Solent]] from [[Aldworth]] to Farringford on the [[Isle of Wight]]. Separately, it has been suggested he may have written it on a yacht anchored in [[Salcombe]]. "The words", he said, "came in a moment".&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;Hill, Robert W., Jr., ed. (1971). ''Tennyson's poetry; authoritative texts, juvenilia and early responses, criticism''. New York:W. W. Norton &amp; Company. {{ISBN|0-393-09953-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before he died, Tennyson told his son [[Hallam Tennyson|Hallam]] to "put 'Crossing the Bar' at the end of all editions of my poems".&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt;

The poem contains four [[stanza]]s that generally alternate between long and short lines. Tennyson employs a traditional ABAB [[rhyme scheme]]. Scholars have noted that the form of the poem follows the content: the wavelike quality of the long-then-short lines parallels the narrative thread of the poem.

The extended metaphor of "crossing the bar" represents travelling serenely and securely from life through death. The Pilot is a metaphor for God, whom the speaker hopes to meet face to face. Tennyson explained, "The Pilot has been on board all the while, but in the dark I have not seen him…[He is] that Divine and Unseen Who is always guiding us."&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt;

The words have been set to music by [[Hubert Parry|Sir Hubert Parry]], [[Joseph Barnby|Sir Joseph Barnby]] Geoffrey Shaw and Dr. George Hewson, organist at St Patrick's Cathedral Dublin.

In 2014,  Ian Assersohn wrote a new setting of the words for male voices.  Assersohn's piece "Crossing the Bar" won the Composers' Competition at the Cornwall International Male Voice Choir Festival, from a field of 40 entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cimvcf.org.uk/2014composers.html|title=Festival20112|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assersohn is the Musical Director of Epsom Male Voice Choir,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epsommalevoicechoir.org.uk/|title=EMVC Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the choir sang the world première of "Crossing the Bar" in Truro Cathedral at the Festival Opening International Gala Concert on Thursday 30 April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cimvcf.org.uk/|title=cimcf.uk home page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A folk music inspired setting for the poem with a refrain was created by Rani Arbo, an American bluegrass musician. The music was written at the time her husband's grandmother was passing away. Peter Amidon has used her melody to create a choral setting.

In August 2018, the writer [[V. S. Naipaul]] died after reading "Crossing the Bar" on his deathbed in [[London]]; his family and friends citing the poem as having always held a great resonance to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2018-08-12/vs-naipaul-died-peacefully-after-reading-tennyson-geordie-greig/|title=VS Naipaul died peacefully after reading Tennyson – Geordie Greig|work=ITV News|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Words to the poem =
"Crossing the bar"
    (Tennyson)
Sunset and evening star,
And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the bar,
When I put out to sea,

But such a tide as moving seems asleep,
Too full for sound and foam,
When that which drew from out the boundless deep
Turns again home.

Twilight and evening bell,
And after that the dark!
And may there be no sadness of farewell,
When I embark;

For tho' from out our bourne of Time and Place
The flood may bear me far,
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crost the bar.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Crossing the Bar by  Alfred, Lord  Tennyson  : The Poetry Foundation|url = http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174588|website = www.poetryfoundation.org|access-date = 2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The websites themselves are ambivalent on that point.|date=April 2014}}

Throughout history, architects have often been chosen by setting up an [[architectural competition]] and awarding the commission on the basis of the most favoured design. With the advent of the internet, a similar process has been set up by a number of businesses offering small-scale competitions for mainly domestic projects. Like an architectural competition, contributors must register but their designs are judged anonymously, and only the winning design is paid a fee.&lt;ref&gt;http://crowdresearch.org/chi2011-workshop/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business Models==
[[Image:Arcbazar How-it-Works.png|thumb|left|300px|Arcbazar Model: The triumvirate of clients, designers and contractors.]]
An unprecedented business model for [[crowdsourcing]] architectural design was launched by [[Cambridge, MA]] based high-tech company [[Arcbazar]] in 2010. It builds on traditional [[architectural competitions]] and provides an online competition platform for small-to-medium scale architecture, landscape, interior design and remodeling projects; and, builds on the triumvirate of clients, designers and contractors. It connects clients with designers through [[architectural competitions]], and links contractors with construction projects.

There are also a growing number of architectural crowdsourcing platforms that direct their call openly to members of the public, facilitating mass-participation and self-organized collaboration to build upon and improve architectural design solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Lorimer, A.O.D. Mass-participation Architecture, Pearl, 2016, [online] https://pearl.plymouth.ac.uk//handle/10026.1/5293 [17/08/16]&lt;/ref&gt; This follows from Jeff Howe's original definition of the term crowdsourcing, which emphasises the idea of an '''open call''' to an '''undefined''' group of people, because "the person who you think would be best qualified to perform the job, isn't always the best person to do it."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0-UtNg3ots&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Crowdsourcing architecture has been heavily criticized by professional architects and architectural guilds. [[Dwell (magazine)|Dwell]], America's leading home and architecture magazine, called the launch of arcbazar "the worst thing to happen to architecture since the internet started."&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/dwell/status/26889122173947904&lt;/ref&gt; This statement caused many heated debates among architectural bloggers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://aureon.nl/opinie/ontwerpen-2/&lt;/ref&gt; The Architects' Journal, Great Britain's leading professional architecture magazine, wrote: "Architecture crowd-sourcing website criticized: Architects have slammed a threatening new crowd-sourcing website in the US which promises to reduce clients' costs."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/daily-news/architecture-crowd-sourcing-website-criticised/8620481.article&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Death of Cook''''' is the name of several [[painting]]s depicting the [[death of James Cook|1779 death]] of the first European visitor to the [[Hawaiian Islands]], [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]] at [[Kealakekua Bay]].  
Most of these paintings seem to go back to an original by [[John Cleveley the Younger]], painted in 1784, although other versions, like that of [[John Webber]], stood model for later copies too.{{dubious|date=February 2012}} Such artworks were reproduced in [[paint]] and [[engraving]] over the course of modern world history.  The much more famous reproductions, like the one at the [[Honolulu Museum of Art]] (allegedly based on the Cleveley version{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}), often depicted Cook as a peacemaker trying to stop the fighting between his sailors and the [[native Hawaiians]] that they had challenged in combat.

However, in 2004, the original Cleveley painting was discovered in a private collection belonging to a family since 1851. Cleveley's brother was a member of Cook's crew, and the painting is said to concur with eyewitness accounts.  The original depicted Cook involved in hand-to-hand combat with the native Hawaiians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The discovery of the original painting has not changed the way most [[history|historians]] view Cook's relationship with the Hawaiians, as during his last voyage, Cook was reported by his contemporaries to have become irrationally violent.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Anne Salmond]], ''The Trial of the Cannibal Dog: Captain Cook in the South Seas'' (New York: Viking, 2003).  Also the violent Cook was depicted by [[George Carter (artist)|George Carter]] (1737-1795) and his painting, 'The Death of Captain Cook' is in the Rex Nan Kivell Collection of the National Library of Australia (Canberra).&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
The original watercolour painting, together with three others in a series by Cleveley, was put up for auction by [[Christie's|Christie's auction house]] in [[London]] in 2004. The lot of four paintings sold for £318,850 (USD 572,655).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/drawings-watercolors/john-cleveley-views-in-the-south-seabr-4347865-details.aspx?intObjectID=4347865&lt;/ref&gt;

A later painting titled ''[[The Death of Captain James Cook (Zoffany)|The Death of Captain James Cook, 14 February 1779]]'' by [[Johann Zoffany]] was begun in circa 1795 and was the painting owned by Cook's widow. This painting is in the [[National Maritime Museum]].&lt;ref name=zoff&gt;[http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/object.cfm?ID=BHC0424 The death of Captain James Cook, 14 February 1779], National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, London, accessed 18 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emanuel Anthony Posselt''' (1858–1921) was an authority on [[Jacquard loom]]s and weaving. His book on the Jacquard machine is considered to be a classic.&lt;ref name=csbio&gt;[https://www.cs.arizona.edu/patterns/weaving/webdocs/pea_bibl.pdf cs.arizona.edu: "Emanuel Anthony Posselt"], by Ralph E. Griswold&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Posselt, the son of Emanuel Anthony and Elizabeth (Demuth) Posselt, was born in [[Liberec|Reichenberg, Austrian Empire]] (current Liberec, [[Czech Republic]]) on 21 August 1858. Emanuel graduated in 1876 from the [[Imperial Government Weaving School]], also in Reichenberg. During the next two years, he visited most of the important textile manufacturing cities in Europe, and during this time he managed his father's textile mills. In August 1878, he went to the United States, where he worked until 1884 for various textile mills in New England and Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

In 1884, Posselt became the inaugural director of the textile division of [[Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art]]. In 1891, he resigned that position to accept the editorship of the [[Textile Record of North America]], at the time a leading trade journal.&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

Posselt then established a private textile academy and a textile trade book business. He published his own work on the Jacquard machine, the technology of textile design, textile calculations, and cotton, wool and silk industries; as well as works by other authors, such as Gardner on wool dyeing.  The series ''Hand Books of the Textile Industry'' and ''Posselt's Textile Library'', as well as ''Posselt's Textile Journal'' that ran between 1907 and 1923, are his own.  The last was the immediate forerunner of [[Textile World]].&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

Posselt died in 1921.&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

==Family==

Posselt married in July 1884 at [[Colchester, Vermont]] Anna Clera Pollinger, by whom he had three children: Anna (1896), Elwood (1906) and Gertrude (1908).&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

The '''film industry in Georgia''' became the largest among U.S. states for production of feature films in 2016. The industry in Georgia was boosted substantially by tax incentives introduced in 2002 and strengthened in 2008. Just in the fiscal year 2017 film and TV production had an economic impact in Georgia of $9.5 billion, while industry sources claim that the tax subsidy costs the state $141 million (2010). [[Atlanta]] is the center of the film industry in Georgia with [[Turner Entertainment|Turner]], [[Tyler Perry Studios|Tyler Perry]] and [[EUE/Screen Gems]] studios located there. There were 348 productions shot in the state in 2009. Films shot in Georgia include [[Tyler Perry]]'s ''[[Meet the Browns (film)|Meet the Browns]]'' (2008), ''[[Life as We Know It (film)|Life as We Know It]]'' (2010), ''[[Contagion (film)|Contagion]]'' (2011) and a number of Marvel Studios productions including [[Avengers: Infinity War|''Avengers-Infinity War'']] and the unnamed Avengers 4 movie, as well as [[Ant-Man and the Wasp|''Ant Man and the Wasp'']] and [[Black Panther (film)|''Black Panther'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2018/02/08/marvel-vp-not-true-marvel-is-abandoning-georgia.html|title=https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2018/02/08/marvel-vp-not-true-marvel-is-abandoning-georgia.html|website=www.bizjournals.com|access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlanta has been called the "Hollywood of the South".&lt;ref name="Georgia Trend Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simmons|first1=Kenna|title=GA GA LAND Georgia’s film industry spurs big plans beyond production|url=http://www.georgiatrend.com/March-2018/GA-GA-LAND/|website=georgiatrend.com|publisher=Georgia Trend Magazine|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first1=The Washington Times|title=How Atlanta became the Hollywood of the South|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/29/how-atlanta-became-the-hollywood-of-the-south/?page=all|accessdate=25 May 2016|work=The Washington Times|date=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ranking==
Georgia overtook California in 2016 as the state location with the most feature films produced.&lt;ref name="Georgia Trend Magazine"/&gt;

==Incentives==
The state's first tax incentive, a point of purchase sales and use tax exemption, was introduced in 2002. The state's second and most progressive tax incentive, the Georgia Entertainment Industry Investment Act, was signed into law in May 2005 and updated in May 2008. The act granted qualified productions a transferable income tax credit of 20% of all in-state costs for film and television investments of $500,000 or more. An additional 10% tax credit was awarded to approved projects that embed a Georgia Entertainment Promotional logo within the titles or credits of each production. This [[vanity card]], usually seen in [[closing credits]], is rendered as an image of the [[Georgia Department of Economic Development]]'s [[peach]] logo, a link to the GDEC's filming-specific tourism website, and a male voice saying or a woman singing "Made in Georgia".&lt;ref name=ded&gt;[http://www.georgia.org/GeorgiaIndustries/Entertainment/FilmTV/Pages/FilmFacts.aspx Georgia Department of Economic Development] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213175803/http://www.georgia.org/GeorgiaIndustries/Entertainment/FilmTV/Pages/FilmFacts.aspx |date=February 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Georgia spent $10.3 million on its film incentive. That amount increased to $140.6 million by 2010.&lt;ref name=fw&gt;[http://filmworks.filmla.com/2011/06/24/californias-top-five-competitors-for-film-tv-production-dollars/ Film Works L.A.]&lt;/ref&gt; By the fiscal year 2015, the amount spent by Georgia in issued tax credits for the year was just over $504 million.&lt;ref&gt;https://opb.georgia.gov/sites/opb.georgia.gov/files/related_files/site_page/FY%202017%20Governor%27s%20Budget%20Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on economy==
The Georgia Film, Music &amp; Digital Entertainment Office states that more than 700 feature films, TV movies, TV series, single episodes, and pilots have been produced in Georgia since 1972.&lt;ref name=ded/&gt; In fiscal year 2017 film and TV production had an economic impact in Georgia of $9.5 billion.&lt;ref name="Georgia Trend Magazine"/&gt;

According to the Georgia Department of Economic Development:&lt;ref name=ded/&gt;
* There are more than 5,000 individual technicians and other workers in Georgia
* The average number of local employees on a medium budget feature film is about 150-175
* On a larger budget production, there are about 200-250 local employees
* The average feature film budget is $41.7 million
* The average amount (below-the-line) of feature film budget spent in a state is 60% - 70%. This is higher for locally produced projects.

==Facilities==
[[Atlanta]] has become a center for film and television production and counts the presence of [[Turner Entertainment|Turner Studios]], which produces content for the [[Turner Broadcasting]] family of stations; since 2008 the [[Tyler Perry Studios]] in Southwest Atlanta; and since 2010 the [[EUE/Screen Gems]] soundstages in [[Lakewood Heights (Atlanta)|Lakewood Heights]], south Atlanta, and to a limited extent, the facilities of [[Georgia Public Broadcasting]], where the first season of ''[[Swift Justice with Nancy Grace]]'' was taped using state tax credits.  Both films and many popular TV shows such as ''[[The Real Housewives of Atlanta]]'', [[Tyler Perry]]'s series, and ''[[Family Feud]]'' (from 2011 to 2017) are produced in Atlanta, while [[Floyd County Productions]]'s [[FXX]] animated series ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'' and several [[Adult Swim]] animated series are also produced under GEDC tax credits. In 2014, [[Pinewood Studios]] opened a large studio in [[Fayette County, Georgia]]. Films such as ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant Man]]'' and ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' have been shot at the studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bell|first1=Kandice|title=Pinewood Studios expanding to accommodate film industry in Ga.|url=http://times-herald.com/news/2017/02/pinewood-studios-expanding-to-accommodate-film-industry-in-ga|work=Times Herald|date=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productions in Georgia==
There were 348 productions shot in the state in 2009. These industry establishments are probably supported wholly or in part by the production of feature films; television movies, series, pilots and miniseries; commercials, music videos, documentaries and still shoots.&lt;ref name=ded/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4592">[[File:Lebedev-Timm.jpg|thumb|200px|Georg Wilhelm Timm; portrait by the engraver Alexander Lebedev (1830-1898)]]
'''Georg Wilhelm Timm''', also known as '''Vasily Fyodorovich Timm''' (Russian: Василий Фёдорович Тимм; 21 June 1820, [[Riga]] - 19 April 1895, [[Berlin]]) was a [[Baltic-German]] painter, [[lithographer]] and ceramic designer, known for his [[Genre art|genre]] and battle scenes. He was also the publisher of the ''{{ill|Russian Art Gazette|ru|Русский художественный листок}}''.

== Biography ==
[[File:Timm modified.jpg|thumb|left|215px|Self-caricature from the [[endpaper]] of a book.]]
His father, Friedrich Wilhelm Timm (1779-1848), was the mayor of Riga.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[http://www.artsait.ru/art/t/tim/main.htm Brief biography] @ Russian Paintings.&lt;/ref&gt; His sister, Emilie, married the painter [[Karl Bryullov]] in 1839. His first art studies were in Riga, then he went to Saint Petersburg, where he enrolled as a "foreign student" at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]]. His primary instructor there was the battle painter, [[Alexander Sauerweid]].&lt;ref name="R"&gt;[http://www.rusartnet.com/biographies/russian-artists/19th-century/early-19th-century/romantic/georg-wilhelm-timm Brief biography] @ RusArtNet.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded two silver medals and graduated in 1839 with the title of "Artist". Five years later, thanks to an Imperial scholarship, he went to Paris where he worked under the direction of [[Horace Vernet]], also a battle painter, and made a visit to [[Algiers]].&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; Upon his return to Paris, he began exhibiting at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] where he attracted critical praise.

The onset of the [[French Revolution of 1848]] forced him to return to Saint Petersburg,&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; where he was initially employed as an illustrator; notably for the works of [[Faddey Bulgarin]] and [[Nikolay Gretsch]]. He worked primarily in the media of lithography and woodcuts and was sometimes referred to as the "Russian [[Paul Gavarni|Gavarni]]".

He travelled extensively throughout Russia, serving as a battle painter during the second phase of the [[Caucasian War]]. In 1852, he accompanied Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] on a visit to Finland . Later, he made sketches at the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–55)|Siege of Sevastopol]]. As a result, in 1855, he was named an "Academician" by the Imperial Academy.&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; 

From 1851 to 1862, by leave of the Royal Family, he published the ''Russian Art Gazette'', which featured works by many prominent Russian artists, made into lithographs by Timm.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; He had to stop publishing the gazette when he began to suffer from an eye disease. 

In 1867, he moved to Berlin to seek treatment and took up a position as the Director of a privately operated ceramics institute.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; He never returned to Russia. In 1876, he was appointed a Professor at the [[Prussian Academy of Arts]] and began working at the [[Royal Porcelain Factory, Berlin|Royal Porcelain Factory]].&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; After his death, his widow donated his estate to the [[Latvian National Museum of Art|Riga City Art Museum]]. A major retrospective was held at their new building in 1906.

The '''Global Award for Sustainable Architecture''' was founded in 2006 by architect and professor [[Jana Revedin]]. The Global Award Community, which consists of the 55 contemporary architects from around the globe who have received the award, works towards a sustainable architectural ethic and fosters research, experimentation and transmission in the fields of sustainable architecture, urban renewal and academic social responsibility. It defines architecture as an agent of empowerment, self-development and civic rights.

Each year the award honours five architects who share a belief in more sustainable development and who have pioneered innovative and holistic approaches in their own communities, in western and emerging countries, in developed cities and precarious districts, in megalopolises and in the countryside. The Award is partnered with [[Museum of Finnish Architecture]], International Architecture Biennale of Ljubljana and the Università luav di Venizia. The Award for Sustainable Architecture is run by the [[Cité de l'Architecture et du Patrimoine]] and is supported by BOUYGUES Batiment International and [[BNP Paribas Real Estate]]. Since 2011, the Award for Sustainable Architecture is under the Patronage of [[UNESCO]].

The laureats of the Global Award for Sustainable Architecture are selected by a scientific committee. The 2017 committee included Jana Revedin, Marie-Hélène Contal, Benno Albrecht, Kristiina Nivari, Spela Hudnik and honorary members, Patrice Doat and Anne Feenstra.

'''''I Am Half-Sick of Shadows, Said the Lady of Shalott''''' is a painting by [[John William Waterhouse]] completed in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnwilliamwaterhouse.com/pictures/lady-shalott-1916|title=I am Half-Sick of Shadows, said the Lady of Shalott|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the third painting by Waterhouse that depicts a scene from the [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] poem, "[[The Lady of Shalott]]".  The title of the painting is a quotation from the last two lines in the fourth and final verse of the second part of the Tennyson's poem:

&lt;poem&gt;
But in her web she still delights
To weave the mirror’s magic sights,
For often thro’ the silent nights
A funeral, with plumes and lights
  And music, came from Camelot:
Or when the moon was overhead
Came two young lovers lately wed;
'I am half sick of shadows,' said
  The Lady of Shalott.
&lt;/poem&gt;

This painting depicts yet an earlier point in the tale of the Lady of Shalott than that depicted by Waterhouse in his previous two works of 1888 and 1894.  The Lady is still confined in her tower, [[weaving]] a [[tapestry]], viewing the world outside only through reflections in the mirror behind her.  In the painting, the mirror reveals a bridge over a river leading to the walls and towers of [[Camelot]]; also visible nearby are a man and a woman, perhaps the "two young lovers lately wed" referred to in Tennyson's poem.  The scene is set shortly before an image of [[Lancelot]] appears in the mirror, enticing the Lady out of her tower to her death.

The painting shows the Lady of Shalott resting from her weaving.&lt;ref name="MCG"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carretero Gonzalez|first=Margarita|editor=Mauricio D. Aguilera Linde |editor2=Maria jose de la Torre Moreno |editor3=Laura Torres Zúñiga|title=Into Another's Skin. Selected Essays in Honour of Maria Luisa Dañobeitia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UGisR2h1WjMC&amp;lpg=PA248|year=2012|publisher=  Granada Editorial Universidad de Granada|isbn= 978-8433853677 |page=248|chapter=Floating Down Beyond Camelot: The Lady of Shalott and the audio-visual imagination}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lady wears a red dress, in a room with [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] columns.  The frame of the [[loom]] and the geometric tiles of the floor lead the viewer into the room, where the red, yellow and blue colours inside echo those the more vivid colours outside.  The [[Shuttle (weaving)|shuttles]] of the loom resemble boats, foreshadowing the Lady's later death.

The painting was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] in 1916.  It was sold from the estate of [[J. G. Griffiths]] at [[Hampton's]] in 1923 for 300 [[guineas]], and passed through the hands of the art dealer [[Arthur de Casseres]].  It was owned by Mr and Mrs [[Frederick Cowan]], and inherited by their great-niece, the wife of Canadian engineer [[Philip Berney Jackson]], who donated to the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] in 1971.

'''India Foundation for the Arts''' (IFA) is a national, [[Nonprofit organisation|non-profit]], the grantmaking organisation that supports the practice, research and education in the arts in India. Established as a public trust in 1993, IFA is headquartered in [[Bangalore]].  Its founder-director, [[Anmol Vellani]] previously worked for the [[Ford Foundation]]. IFA's mission is to enrich the arts in India, by providing support for innovative projects and capacity building across all the arts.

==Management==
The Founder Director, Anmol Vellani, is a professional in arts management and organised [[philanthropy]]. Executive Director, Arundhati Ghosh is an internationally recognised professional in the arts and organised philanthropy.

The staff at IFA comes with diverse backgrounds and experiences and is encouraged to engage with and respond to the changing needs and aspirations of the field.

The [[Board of Trustees]] bring to their work considerable experience in the arts and humanities, industry, finance, public affairs, communication and law. They share a common passion for the enrichment of arts and culture.

==Programmes==

The grant programmes of IFA respond to demand for assistance, while also giving encouragement to new perspectives and directions in the arts. IFA has made over 450 grants across states.

The '''Arts Research''' programme supports scholars, researchers, and practitioners to undertake research into the histories and expressions of artistic practices in India. It seeks to foster wider perspectives, understandings, interpretations and engagements in the arts.

The '''Arts Education''' programme places the school teacher at the centre of its work and supports artists through grants, towards arts-based education in Government Schools in Karnataka. It maintains a continuous dialogue with the [[National Council of Educational Research and Training|National Council of Research Education and Training (NCERT)]], the Directorate of Public Instruction, Karnataka, the Department of State Education, Research and Training (DSERT), Karnataka, and Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, to intensify its capacity building programme.

The '''Arts Practice''' programme supports critical practice in the arts. It encourages practitioners working across artistic disciplines to question existing notions through their practice. The programme seeks to establish a culture where arts practice is constantly being shaped and articulated through experimentation, critique and dialogue.

The '''Archival and Museum Fellowships''' support practitioners and researchers to activate the collections in [[Archive|archives]] and [[Museum|museums]] through curatorial and artistic interventions.The Fellowships enable collections to come alive and be made accessible to a large public, with the hope that this engagement will allow museums and archives, to function less as repositories and more as sites that influence discourse, and creativity in the arts.

'''Josep Cusachs i Cusachs''' (19 July 1851 &amp;ndash; 1908) was a [[Catalonian]] soldier and painter.

== Biography ==
He was born in [[Montpellier]], France, while his parents were travelling, but spent most of his life in the area between Barcelona and [[Mataró]]. In 1865, he enrolled at the "Academia Militar de Artillería" in [[Segovia]], became a Captain, and fought in the [[Third Carlist War]].&lt;ref name="B"&gt;[http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/c/cusachs.htm  Biografías y Vidas]: Josep Cusachs&lt;/ref&gt; He retired with the rank of Commander in 1882 to dedicate himself to art.&lt;ref name="G"&gt;[http://www.enciclopedia.cat/enciclopèdies/gran-enciclopèdia-catalana/EC-GEC-0021123.xml Gran Enciclopèdia Catalana]: Brief biography&lt;/ref&gt; His army experience was still an important part of his life, however, and his paintings were mostly on military subjects, especially the cavalry, due to his love for horses. He studied locally with [[Simó Gómez]], and in Paris with [[Édouard Detaille]], an expert on [[military art]].&lt;ref name="G" /&gt;

His first exhibition came in 1884 at the [[Sala Parés]], a major art gallery in Barcelona, where he continued to exhibit regularly, with great critical and financial success. Three years later, he participated in an exposition in Madrid, where his painting ''En el campo de maniobras'' (Maneuvers in the Field), was purchased by Queen [[Maria Christina of Austria|María Cristina]].&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; In 1891, he won a gold medal at the International Exposition in Berlin with ''Maniobras de división'' (Divisional Maneuvers).&lt;ref name="G" /&gt;

In addition to his military art, he stood out as a portrait painter, with such notable sitters as King [[Alfonso XIII]], General [[Juan Prim]] and Mexican President [[Porfirio Díaz]],&lt;ref name="G" /&gt; (on display at the State Art Museum of Veracruz in [[Orizaba]]). He also dealt with religious themes, including his well-known ''La huída a Egipto'' (The Flight from Egypt), which is in the [[Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey]].

In later years, he specialized in paintings of sport riding. The landscapes in many of his works were often entrusted to other painters, as he felt that he lacked the training to execute them properly.&lt;ref&gt;Ricar Mas i Peinado, ''Els artistes catalans i la publicitat (1888-1929)'', Parsifal Edicions, Barcelona, 2002, {{ISBN|84-95554-16-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good selection of his illustrations may be found in ''Military Life in Spain'' by {{ill|Francesc Barado|ca|Francesc Barado i Font}} (Ramirez, 1888).

He died in 1908 (some sources say 1909) in [[Barcelona]].

The '''Kells Crozier''' or ''British Museum Crozier'' is a mediaeval Irish bishop's staff that has been part of the [[British Museum]]'s collection since 1859.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/t/the_kells_crozier.aspx British Museum Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; This rare object, one of only four extant complete examples known from Ireland,  mysteriously appeared in [[London]] in 1850, before being acquired by the museum.

==Description==
The Kells Crozier was made by various craftsmen over at least two different periods between the late 9th and 11th century AD. While the core of the [[crozier]] is wooden, the crook is made of silver and the staff is covered in a copper alloy sheet which was later covered with silver mounts or knobs filled with animal interlace typical of the period. The curved crest of the crook is elaborately decorated with interlinking birds; where this meets the straight end of the crook a human head appears. This is where the crozier would have once held some holy relics. Its total length measures about 133&amp;nbsp;cm.

==History of the Crozier ==
Underneath the crest of the crook is engraved an inscription in mixed Latin and the old [[Irish language]]: "ordo conduilis ocius do mel finnen", which, roughly translated, asks supplicants to pray for Cúduilig and Maelfinnén who were involved in its refurbishment. Scholars have identified these names with individuals who were connected with the important Irish monastic settlement at [[Kells, County Meath]]. However, recent research has  cast doubts about this connection. The crozier was found without explanation in the cupboard of a London [[solicitor]]'s office in the middle of the nineteenth century. It subsequently belonged to several owners (including [[Cardinal Wiseman]]) before being purchased by the British Museum.

==Reliquary Deposit==
A key role of the Kells Crozier was to act as a repository for holy relics for the pious faithful. Enshrining items which had once belonged to saints or church leaders, such as their bones or parts of their clothing,  was an important feature of religious life in early medieval Ireland. Other reliquaries common to Ireland in this period were the bell shrines, such as [[St Patrick]]'s Bell in the [[National Museum of Ireland]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.ie/en/exhibition/list/ten-major-pieces.aspx?article=3a7f87c7-ee55-459d-b7c8-577becc19e15 National Museum of Ireland website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; and St Conall Cael's Bell in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/s/st_conall_caels_bell.aspx British Museum Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10394">In philosophical discourse, '''lexis''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]]: λέξις "word") is a complete group of words in a language, vocabulary, the total set of all words in a language, and all words that have meaning or a function in grammar.

== Lexis according to Plato ==

According to [[Plato]], lexis is the manner of speaking. Plato said that lexis can be divided into [[mimesis]] (imitation properly speaking) and [[diegesis]] (simple narrative). Gerard Genette states: "Plato's theoretical division, opposing the two pure and heterogeneous modes of narrative and imitation, within poetic diction, elicits and establishes a practical classification of genres, which includes the two distinct modes...and a mixed mode, for example the Iliad".&lt;ref&gt;"Boundaries of a Narrative," ''New Literary History'', Vol. 8, No. 1, Readers and Spectators: Some Views and Reviews (Autumn, 1976), pp. 1–13. JSTOR. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the ''[[Iliad]]'', a Greek epic written by Homer, the mixed mode is very prevalent. According to [[Gerald Prince]], diegesis in the ''Iliad'' is the fictional storytelling associated with the fictional world and the enacting/re-telling of the story. Mimesis in the'' Iliad'' is the imitation of everyday, yet fantastical life in the ancient Greek world. Diegesis and mimesis combined represent the fullest extent of lexis; both forms of speech, narrating and re-enacting.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Prince. ''A Dictionary of Narratolog''y. 2003. University of Nebraska Press&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In conclusion, lexis is the larger overview of literature. Within lexis the two areas of differentiation of mimesis (imitation) are diegesis (narrative) and the "direct representation of the actors speaking to the public."&lt;ref&gt;Gennette 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lexis according to Aristotle ==

According to Jose M. Gonzalez, "Aristotle instructs us to view of his psychology, as mediating the rhetorical task and entrusted with turning the orator's subject matter into such opinion of the listeners and gain their pistis."&lt;ref&gt;Jose M. Gonzalez, "Phantasia and Aristotle." JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt; Pistis is the Greek word for faith and is one of the rhetorical modes of persuasion.
 
Gonzalez also points out that, "By invoking phantasia, lexis against the background Aristotle instructs us to view of his psychology, as mediating the rhetorical task and entrusted with turning the orator's subject matter into such opinion of the listeners and gain their pistis." [[Phantasia (philosophy)|Phantasia]] is a Greek word meaning the process by which all images are presented to us. Aristotle defines phantasia as "our desire for the mind to mediate anything not actually present to the senses with a mental image." &lt;ref&gt;Jana Noel. "Interpreting Aristotle's Phantasia and Claiming its Role Within Phronesis". 1997.[http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/eps/PES-Yearbook/97_docs/noel.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle instructs the reader to use his or her imagination to create the fantastic, unordinary images, all the while using narrative and re-enactment to create a play either written or produced.

== Elements of rhetorical diction according to Aristotle ==

Although Aristotle at times seems to demean the art of diction or 'voice,' saying that it is not an "elevated subject of inquiry," he does go into quite a bit of detail on its importance and its proper use in rhetorical speech.  Often calling it "style," he defines good style as follows: that it must be clear and avoid extremes of baseness and loftiness.  Aristotle makes the cases for the importance of diction by saying that, "it is not enough to know what we ought to say; we must also say it as we ought.".&lt;ref&gt;''The Rhetoric and the Poetics of Aristotle''. Trans. W. Rhys Roberts. Ed.  [[Donald McQuade|Donald, McQuade]]. New York: The Modern Library, 1984, p. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; In an oratorical speech, one must consider not only the facts, but also how to put the facts into words and which words and, also, the "proper method of delivery." &lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle goes on to say that only the facts in an argument should be important but that since the listeners can be swayed by diction, it must also be considered. 
 
'''Voice''' 

At the time when Aristotle wrote his treatise on Rhetoric, orators had not paid much attention to voice.  They thought it was a subject only of concern to actors and poets. In ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|The Rhetoric]]'', Aristotles says, "proper method of delivery…affects the success of a speech greatly; but hitherto the subject has been neglected." &lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle defined voice as controlling one's voice, using rate, volume and pitch, to convey the appropriate emotions.  The manner of voice in which an idea or speech is conveyed affects not only the emotions of the audience but, also, their ability to understand this concept.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Although Aristotle gives this mention and explanation of voice, he does not go into specifics about how to produce appropriate voice or how to convey specific tones with one's voice.  This may or may not be due to his mild disdain for the topic as a whole. Modern scholars have explored voice more extensively. According to Taylor Stoehr, "voice is the pervasive reflection in written or spoken language, of an author's character, the marks by which we recognize his utterance as his.".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor Stoehr. "Tone and Voice."  ''College English'' Nov. 1968:  JSTOR. Pius XII Library, St. Louis, MO.  28 April 2008. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/374450]. p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;  However, just as in Aristotle's time set of specific rules or guidelines has yet been laid out for the production or interpretation of voice.  Due to the vast array of elements involved in the production of voice this task would be nearly, if not entirely, impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Stoehr 150&lt;/ref&gt;       

'''Language'''

As mentioned before, Aristotle thought the language of a speech should avoid being too lofty or too crude.  The speaker must use the ordinary language of everyday life.  However, because people best remember what is out of the ordinary, the speaker must use some language that gives the speech an air of importance.

The elevation of the language must correlate to the elevation of the subject or, in poetry, the character that is speaking.  In poetry, language and linguistic devices that convey a sense of importance are more appropriate, and should be used more often because the events of poetry are more removed from ordinary life.  They are less appropriate in rhetorical speech because the topics relate more directly to ordinary things and the people who are listening to the speech.  Most of all, the speaker must "give the impression of speaking naturally and not artificially." &lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; When one seems to speak with ease, the audience is more easily persuaded that the facts he is communicating are truthful. 

Also, a speaker must avoid using very many "strange words, compound words, and invented words.".&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle considered this kind of language an excessive departure from the way people normally speak.  However, one acceptable departure from plain language is the use of [[metaphor]] because metaphors are used by all people in everyday conversation.

== Two forms of lexis ==

According to Aristotle, lexis, meaning the delivery of words, is the least important area of speech when in comparison to invention, arrangement and style.  However, lexis is still closely looked at and broken down into two forms.  The two types of lexis in rhetoric include: ''lexis graphike'' and ''lexis agonistike'' &lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Sonkowsky, ”An Aspect of Delivery in Ancient Rhetorical Theory.” p. 259 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/view/283710?seq=4&amp;Search=yes&amp;term=agonistike&amp;term=graphike&amp;term=lexis&amp;list=hide&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dlexis%2Bgraphike%2Band%2Blexis%2Bagonistike%26dc%3DAll%2BDisciplines&amp;item=1&amp;ttl=1&amp;returnArticleService=showArticle&amp;cookieSet=1]&lt;/ref&gt; The separate terms that describe the two forms of lexis, graphike and agonistike, have been conformed by several Latin terms.  Although the words directly relate to the type of lexis, the theories of Aristotle and Plato do not compare.

''Lexis graphike'' comes from the term ''zographia'', meaning realistic painting, and graphe, meaning writing. Plato believes that writing and painting are one of the same.   His theory proves that both do not have the capability to defend themselves through an argument, question and answer, which conveys that these forms can not prove truth. Although for Aristotle, ''lexis graphik''e is the most accurate delivery of language, which leads to his theory that proves that writing does not need to be questioned because it is already exact.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, 264&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Lexis agonistike'' however is from the term ''skiagraphia'', meaning a rough sketch or outline of painting.  Aristotle once again opposes Plato by believing that ''lexis agonistike'' does not need questions asked, but only answers.  The answer refers to the use of invention given to the actor because the writing portion is only outlined.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, 265&lt;/ref&gt;

To further understand the separate types of lexis, each type can be broken down by how the writing is prepared and delivered.  ''Lexis graphike'' is the most precise style of rhetoric and strongly appeals to intelligence.  The delivery of ''lexis graphike'' is designed for a careful reading from either the book or paper as opposed to a performance that leaves room for improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; This type of lexis is a simple, straight forward recitation rather than an elaborate presentation.  ''Lexis graphike'' is most accurately written and depends the least upon the person who is delivering the speech.  ''Lexis agonistike'' contradicts ''lexis graphike'' because it is typically carelessly written and meant for a full performance.  The lack of attention given to the written words allows the performer to improvise. This gives the presentation a style that reflects the entertainer rather the writer.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes in the 2010s==

'''2012'''

On April 6, 2011 the Recording Academy announced a major overhaul of many Grammy Award categories.&lt;ref name="grammy.org"&gt;[http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement Recording Academy Awards Category Restructuring] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408162804/http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement |date=2011-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the number of categories fell from 109 to 78. Some categories were discontinued, others were merged or renamed.

'''2013'''

On June 8, 2012, the Academy announced a few changes {{as of|2013|lc=y}}, including the addition of three new categories: Best Classical Compendium, Best Latin Jazz Album and Best Urban Contemporary Album. This meant the number of categories in 2013 rose to 81.

According to the Academy, the '''Best Classical Compendium''' is "for an album collection containing (...) newly recorded material of performances (vocal or instrumental) by various soloist(s) and/or ensemble(s) involving a mixture of classical subgenres."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/jun-08-2012-320-am|title=THE RECORDING ACADEMY®'S BOARD OF TRUSTEES MEETING RESULTS IN CONTINUED EVOLUTION OF GRAMMY® CATEGORIES|work=The GRAMMYs|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albums entered in this category cannot be entered in other classical album categories, but individual tracks can.

The intent for the newly formed '''Best Latin Jazz Album''' is "to recognize recordings that represent the blending of jazz with Latin, Iberian-American, Brazilian, and Argentinean tango music."&lt;ref name="grammy.org"/&gt;

The new '''Best Urban Contemporary Album''' category is for albums with contemporary songs derivative of R&amp;B. It is for artists who blend contemporary styles with R&amp;B music, such as urban (euro)pop, urban rock and/or urban alternative.

Other changes for the 2013 Grammy Award season were:
* [[Best Small Ensemble Performance]] category (in the classical field) has been renamed [[Best Chamber Music/Small Ensemble Performance]].
* [[Best Latin Pop, Rock or Urban Album]] has been split into two categories: [[Best Latin Pop Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album|Best Latin Rock, Alternative or Urban Album]], thereby returning to the situation prior to 2012.
* The [[Best Banda or Norteño Album]] and [[Best Regional Mexican or Tejano Album]] categories have been merged into one category: [[Grammy Award for Best Regional Mexican Music Album (including Tejano)|Best Regional Mexican Music Album (including Tejano)]].
* Mastering engineers will now be considered nominees and award winners in the [[Record of the Year]] category.

'''2014'''

Changes were made in 2014. One was the introduction of a new category, '''[[Best American Roots Song]]''', which encompasses all subgenres in the American roots music field such as Americana, bluegrass, blues, folk and regional roots music. The award will be presented to the songwriter(s).
The '''[[Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance]]''' category, introduced in 2012, was split and recognises metal performances only. It was renamed '''[[Best Metal Performance]]''' (returning to the situation prior to 2012). Hard rock performances are screened in the [[Best Rock Performance]] category, thus losing its own genre award.
The two Music Video categories were renamed. The '''Best Short Form Music Video''' became the [[Best Music Video]] category, while '''Best Long Form Music Video''' is now [[Best Music Film]]. The rules and description of these two categories did not change. Also new for 2014 was the '''Music Educator Award.''' It recognizes "current educators (kindergarten through college, public and private schools) who have made a significant and lasting contribution to the field of music education and who demonstrate a commitment to the broader cause of maintaining music education in the schools."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/a-total-of-25-semifinalists-from-across-the-us-announced-for-first|title=A TOTAL OF 25 SEMIFINALISTS FROM ACROSS THE U.S. ANNOUNCED FOR FIRST-EVER MUSIC EDUCATOR AWARD PRESENTED BY  THE RECORDING ACADEMY® AND  THE GRAMMY FOUNDATION®|work=The GRAMMYs|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2015'''

The Recording Academy introduced further changes beginning on the 2015 ceremony: particularly allowing [[Music sampling|samples]] or [[interpolation (music)|interpolations]] of previously written songs in all songwriting categories, most notably the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] category.&lt;ref name="Grammy 2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/news/the-recording-academy-announces-grammy-awards-process-changes |title=The Recording Academy Announces GRAMMY Awards Process Changes |publisher=The Recording Academy |date=June 12, 2014 |accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additional changes include:
* the introduction of '''[[Best American Roots Performance]]''' in the American Roots Music Field
* Dance/Electronica Field to Dance/Electronic Music Field
** renaming [[Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album|Best Dance/Electronica Album]] to '''Best Dance/Electronic Album'''
* introduction of Contemporary Instrumental Music Field
** renaming of [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Album|Best Pop Instrumental Album]] to '''Best Contemporary Instrumental Album'''
* restructuring the categories of the Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music Field&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/6776/20140612/grammy-awards-makes-changes-christian-gospel-categories.htm |title=The Grammy Awards Makes Changes to the Christian/Gospel Categories |publisher=Music Times |date=June 12, 2014 |accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** creation of [[Best Gospel Performance/Song]], with both the artist(s) and songwriter(s) as recipient(s)
** creation of [[Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song]], with both the artist(s) and songwriter(s) as recipient(s)
** introduction of [[Best Roots Gospel Album]]
* moving [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album|Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album]] to the Pop Field
* changing [[Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Performance|Best Classical Vocal Solo]] (albums and tracks) to '''Best Classical Solo Vocal Album''' (limited to albums only)
* renaming [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement|Best Instrumental Arrangement]] to '''Best Arrangement, Instruments And Vocals'''
* renaming [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s)|Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s)]] to '''Best Arrangement, Instrumental Or A Cappella'''

The introduction of the changed will push the total number of categories to 83.&lt;ref name="Grammy 2015" /&gt;

'''2017'''

In June 2016, the Grammy organization announced changes to the voting and awarding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/the-recording-academy-announces-rule-amendments-and-dates-for-the|title=THE RECORDING ACADEMY® ANNOUNCES RULE AMENDMENTS AND DATES FOR THE 59TH ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS PROCESS|publisher=|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recordings released solely through streaming services became eligible to enter the award process. These recordings must be available through streaming platforms. Applicable streaming services are paid subscription, full catalog, on-demand streaming/limited download platforms that have existed as such within the United States for at least one full year as of the submission deadline. All recordings entered must have an assigned [[International Standard Recording Code]] (ISRC).

Best New Artist rules were amended to remove the album barrier given trends in how new music and developing artists are released and promoted; many new artists first release singles, tracks, or EPs rather than full albums. To become eligible in the category of Best New Artist, the artist, duo, or group:
* Must have released a minimum of five singles/tracks or one album, but no more than 30 singles/tracks or three albums.
* May not have entered the category more than three times, including as a performing member of an established group.
* Must have achieved a breakthrough into the public consciousness and impacted the musical landscape during the eligibility period.

The [[Best Blues Album]] category was split back into two distinct categories, as they were prior to 2012:
* [[Best Traditional Blues Album]] (Blues recordings with traditional blues song and harmonic structures, including various subgenres such as Delta blues, Piedmont blues, jump/swing blues, Chicago blues, and classic/Southern soul).
* [[Best Contemporary Blues Album]] (Recordings which may employ non-traditional blues rhythms such as funk, hip-hop, reggae, and rock, or which feature contemporary techniques such as synthesizers or [[Loop (music)|loops]]).

The Best Rap/Sung Collaboration category (in the Rap field) was renamed as Best Rap/Sung Performance to allow solo performances, a result of "the current state and future trajectory of rap by expanding the category beyond collaborations between rappers and vocalists to include recordings by a solo artist who blurs the lines between rapping and singing."

Additional amendments were made to the number and type of music creators recognized in the categories of [[Best Choral Performance]] and [[Best jazz vocal album|Best Jazz Vocal Album]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23086">In their career, the British rock band [[Led Zeppelin]] recorded many songs that consisted, in whole or part, of pre-existing songs, melodies, or lyrics. They sometimes credited those sources, sometimes not. The band has been sued a number of times over attribution, some cases having concluded with others being awarded writing credit for the song in question.

This is a partial list of songs that contributed to or inspired Led Zeppelin songs or covers. It includes non-controversial ones the band attributed to other writers from the outset.

&lt;!-- If you add a new song/row, be sure to increase the "rowspan" for its album to match. 
		So if it's a Led Zeppelin II song, find the row that says something like:

		| rowspan='3' style="background-color:#fff;" | [[Led Zeppelin II]]

		and change rowspan='3' to rowpsan='4', because you just added the fourth song from that album

 | colspan=6 | This song was correctly credited to Willie Dixon, but a similar controversy exists over whether Page got the idea from friend and former bandmate [[Jeff Beck]]:

{{quote|[Beck] had the same sort of taste in music as I did. That's why you'll find on the early LPs we both did a song like "You Shook Me." It was the type of thing we'd both played in bands. Someone told me he'd already recorded it after we'd already put it down on the first Zeppelin album. I thought, "Oh dear, it's going to be identical", but it was nothing like it, fortunately. I just had no idea he'd done it. It was on ''[[Truth (Jeff Beck album)|Truth]]'' but I first heard it when I was in Miami after we'd recorded our version. It's a classic example of coming from the same area musically, of having a similar taste.&lt;ref name=Schulps&gt;Dave Schulps, [http://www.iem.ac.ru/zeppelin/docs/interviews/page_77.trp Interview with Jimmy Page], ''[[Trouser Press]]'', October 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Major differences between both versions include the prominence afforded [[Nicky Hopkins]] keyboard playing in the [[Mickie Most]] mix, and that Rod Stewart sings only two verses in the Jeff Beck recording.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg Akkerman, (2014) "You Shook Me", ''Experiencing Led Zeppelin: A Listener's Companion'', p.7, {{ISBN|978-0-8108-8915-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12433">'''Music and political warfare''' have been used together in many different political contexts and cultures as a way to reach a targeted audience in order to deliver a specific political message. [[Political warfare]] as defined by Paul A. Smith is the "use of political means to compel an opponent to do one's will... commonly through the use of words, images and ideas."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Paul A. On Political War, National Defense University Press, 1989, p 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Music]] is useful because it creates an easily recognizable and memorable method of delivery for the desired message. Music is particularly useful medium for the delivery of [[propaganda]].  Jacques Ellul stated that for propaganda to be effective it must "fill the citizen's whole day and every day".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Ellul. ''Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes''. Vintage Books, 1965, p 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Since music is often viewed to be a leisure activity, it is often not considered to be as threatening as other [[propaganda techniques]], and as a result messages can often be surreptitiously communicated without being conspicuously noticed.

==American Revolution==
During the [[American Revolution]], songs and poems were a very popular form of satire and also served as a medium for sharing the news and gossip of the day. As a result, many of the battles and skirmishes between the Americans and the British were retold and celebrated in the form of songs. [[Samuel Adams]] utilized music and protest songs in the mass public demonstrations he organized to protest British practices towards the American colonists&lt;ref&gt;J.Michael Waller. ''Propaganda the American Way'' &lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:intlist-jmw-propaganda-article.pdf]] --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After a humiliating retreat for the British-during which time the Americans engaged in the "ungentlemanly" act of firing at the backs of their retreating enemy -the British were immortalized in song:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
How brave you went out with muskets all bright, 
&lt;br /&gt;And thought to befrighten the folks with the sight;
&lt;br /&gt;But when you got there how they powder’d your pums, 
&lt;br /&gt;And all the way home how they pepper’d your bums, 
&lt;br /&gt;And is it not, honies, a comical farce,
&lt;br /&gt;To be proud in the face, and be shot in the arse.&lt;ref&gt;J.Michael Waller, ''Founding Political Warfare Documents of the American Revolution'', Crossbow Press, 2009, p 297&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perhaps the most well known song to emerge during this time was [[Yankee Doodle]]. Originally conceived by the British in an attempt to mock and demoralize the ragged American troops, it was instead adopted by the Americans as a rallying anthem.&lt;ref&gt;Waller, 319-320.&lt;/ref&gt; In the language of the day, "doodle" referred to a fool or simpleton while "dandy" meant a gentleman of highly exaggerated dress and manners.&lt;ref name="yankee-doodle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlyamerica.com/music/yankee-doodle.htm |title=Yankee Doodle Dandy - The Music of Early America |publisher=Earlyamerica.com |date=2013-12-05 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally the term "macaroni" was a type of dress popular in Italy and widely imitated in England at the time.&lt;ref name="yankee-doodle"/&gt; The song mocked the American's ragged and rough style of dress in comparison to the British armies distinct formal "red coat" uniform and portrayed the Americans as backwards and ignorant, a portrayal the Americans openly accepted. Thus instead of demoralizing the Americans, Yankee Doodle instead had the opposite effect of demoralizing the British who were later defeated by this army of "backwards and ignorant" individuals.

==Nazi Germany==
One group who understood the role that music played in spreading their political message was the Nazis in Hitler's Germany. Clearly understanding the link between music and political warfare, propaganda minister Josef Goebbels once stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Music affects the heart and emotions more than the intellect.  Where then could the heart of a nation beat stronger than in the huge masses, in which the heart of a nation has found its true home?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holocaustmusic.ort.org/politics-and-propaganda/third-reich/ |title=Music and the Holocaust: General Overview |publisher=Holocaustmusic.ort.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hitler made use of music glorifying Germanic legends, such as the works of Richard Wagner. Wagner's operas employed imagery of knights which Hitler then co-opted for images of himself &lt;ref&gt;Arnold Perris. Music as Propaganda: Art to Persuade, Art to Control. Greenwood Press, 1985, p52&lt;/ref&gt;

Music was used within the Hitler Youth organization as a way to indoctrinate the youth of Germany into the Nazi's ideology. As part of their activities, group singing was a way to educate the young members of the group. According to an internal memo, songs were seen as "possess[ing] the strongest community building power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holocaustmusic.ort.org/politics-and-propaganda/third-reich/music-hitler-youth/ |title=Music and the Holocaust: Music amongst the Hitler Youth |publisher=Holocaustmusic.ort.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communism==
Communist states such as the USSR and China have also utilized music as a way to spread their message of global communism. The [[Soviet Union]] sought to control the negative influences of music on the people and attempted to shape the messages being used in music to glorify the Soviet regime. Throughout Communist rule, the state sought to create legislation that in effect controlled the creative output of musicians and composers by limiting musical education, controlling which musicians could be employed and by only allowing "approved" musical performances-in short ensuring that all music was within keeping with Communist principles and ideology.&lt;ref name="Perris"&gt;Arnold Perris. M''usic as Propaganda: Art to Persuade, Art to Control''. Greenwood Press, 1985,72.&lt;/ref&gt; Songs were often used in the revolutionary period because they could be easily shaped to have explicit and revolutionary messages set to a simple melody.&lt;ref name="Perris"/&gt;

In the [[People's Republic of China]], Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] believed that it was essential to employ national music in order to "reeducate" the Chinese people and make them accept Communist reforms. Mao stated that &lt;blockquote&gt;
"in music you may apply appropriate foreign principles and use foreign musical instruments. But still there must be national characteristics...The arts are inseparable from the customs, feelings and even the language of the people, from the history of the nation"&lt;ref&gt;Perris, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In China under Mao's rule it became essential to re-educate artists and composers to turn away from traditional operas that often portrayed imperial China and espoused Buddhist and Confucian morals in their stories.&lt;ref&gt;Perris, 95&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Communist Party established an academy for the arts in Yan'an in 1937 which was intended to "rectify" the people of the arts and instruct them on how to incorporate the themes and objectives of the Communist Party into their works&lt;ref&gt;Perris, 96&lt;/ref&gt;

What has been seen in these countries however, does not conform with Communist views on art and artistic expression before the international Communist movement came to be under the rule of Stalinist bureaucracy.

==Other modern uses==
In [[Uzbekistan]] there has been an increase in television programming that seeks to convey the regime's political and ideological messages. As a way to counter growing [[Islamic fundamentalism]], Uzbek television programming has vilified Islamists through the use of pop videos by a group called [[Setora]], a trio dubbed the "Tashkent Spice Girls".&lt;ref name="Asian"&gt;{{cite web|last=Aslan |first=Chris |url=http://www.cacianalyst.org/?q=node/509 |title=MILITARY MUSIC VIDEOS AS UZBEK POP PROPAGANDA &amp;#124; Central Asia-Caucasus Institute Analyst |publisher=Cacianalyst.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Setora's music video tells the story of a young soldier, the boyfriend of one of three girls, who is sent away on a military assignment away from his loved one. Intertwined with this story are scenes of a mother and her children being taken captive by a highly caricatured Islamic extremist. As the video continues the soldier sweeps in to the rescue of the family, dying a hero in the process.&lt;ref name="Asian"/&gt; The imagery of  a mother is often used as a symbol for the state and in this case the state must be protected and preserved from the threat of Islamic extremism.

The banning of music itself can also be a method of political warfare. This was the case in Afghanistan while the [[Taliban]] held power.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jrqUtwRti4QvO8X4_bShYsGbg2wQ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516064046/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jrqUtwRti4QvO8X4_bShYsGbg2wQ |date=May 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of the insurgency in southern Somalia, the Islamist group [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] also banned music on radio stations it controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/mar/11/somalia-rebels-clash-in-air-wars/?page=2 |title=Somalia, rebels clash in air wars |publisher=Washington Times |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebel outfits were seeking to establish Sharia law within the country and saw eliminating music as a way to purge society of what they deemed "evil actions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/16/AR2010041604894_2.html?sid=ST2010041604944 |title=For Somalis caught between Islamists and weak government, fleeing is only option |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2010-04-16 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music and public diplomacy==
Music has also been used as a successful tool for [[public diplomacy]], the so-called "softer" side of political warfare. One common technique employed by the [[United States Information Agency]] (USIA), once the center of the United States' entire public diplomacy strategy, was to arrange for musical exchanges. This was often done by scheduling tours of notable American musicians to foreign countries, especially those under Communist regimes, as a way to expose the average citizen to Americans and their culture.

Another way that American music was used in public diplomacy was through radio programming on the [[Voice of America]]. Willis Conover's "Music USA" jazz programming that exposed foreign audiences to American jazz music through songs, interviews with artists and musicians as well as Conover's color commentary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afsa.org/fsj/jul03/dizard.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713045610/http://www.afsa.org/fsj/jul03/dizard.pdf |date=July 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Music USA" soon became one of VOA's most popular programs.

'''''My Dinner with Andre''''' is a 1981 American [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Louis Malle]], and written by and starring [[Andre Gregory]] (Andre) and [[Wallace Shawn]] (Wally). The actors play fictionalized versions of themselves sharing a conversation at [[Café des Artistes]] in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.courant.com/1999-06-20/entertainment/9906200314_1_peter-sellers-dr-strangelove-two-great-films Johnson, Malcolm, "Cinestudio Salutes Columbia", ''Hartford Courant'' (June 20, 1999)]&lt;/ref&gt; The film's dialogue covers such things as [[experimental theatre]], the nature of theatre, and the nature of life, and contrasts Wally's modest [[humanism]] with Andre's spiritual experiences.

==Structure==
Andre Gregory is the focus of the first hour of the film, when he describes some of his experiences since giving up his career as a theatre director in 1975. These include working with his friend, director [[Jerzy Grotowski]], and a group of Polish actors in a forest in [[Poland]], his visit to [[Findhorn Ecovillage|Findhorn]] in Scotland, and his trip to the [[Sahara]] to try to create a play based on ''[[The Little Prince]]'' by [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry|St.-Exupéry]]. He worked with a group in a small piece of [[performance art]] on [[Long Island]], which resulted in Andre's being (briefly) [[Premature burial#Voluntary burial|buried alive]] on [[Halloween]] night.

The rest of the film is a conversation as Wally Shawn tries to argue that living life as Andre has done for the past five years is simply not possible for most people. He relates ordinary pleasures, like having a cup of coffee. Andre responds that what passes for normal life in New York in the late 1970s, is more akin to living in a dream than it is to real life. The movie ends without a clear resolution to the conflict in worldviews articulated by the two men. Wally reminisces during a taxi ride about his childhood and mentions that when he arrives at home, he tells his girlfriend Debbie about his dinner with Andre. [[Erik Satie]]'s ''[[Gymnopédies|Gymnopédie No. 1]]'' plays in the background.

==Cast==
*[[Andre Gregory]] as Andre
*[[Wallace Shawn]] as Wally
*Jean Lenauer as waiter
*Roy Butler&lt;!--- not the politician ---&gt; as bartender

==Production==
The idea for the film arose from Gregory's effort to work with a biographer on his life story, and Shawn's simultaneously coming up with an idea for a story about two people having a conversation.&lt;ref name="Criterion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AVClub"/&gt; Gregory and Shawn, who had become friends through theatre work, decided to collaborate on the project. They agreed that it should be filmed rather than produced as a play.&lt;ref name=Criterion/&gt; Although the film was based on events in the actors' lives, Shawn and Gregory denied (in an interview by film critic [[Roger Ebert]]) that they were playing themselves. They said that if they remade the film, they would swap the two characters to prove their point. In an interview with [[Noah Baumbach]] in 2009, Shawn said, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I actually had a purpose as I was writing this: I wanted to destroy that guy that I played, to the extent that there was any of ''me'' there. I wanted to kill that side of myself by making the film, because that guy is totally motivated by fear.&lt;ref name="wally"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The screenplay went through numerous developmental changes in location; in the final version, it was set during a dinner at a restaurant. While Shawn was trying to find someone to direct the film, he received a phone call from French director [[Louis Malle]]. He had read a copy of the screenplay via a mutual friend and insisted that he work on the project, saying he wanted to direct, produce the film, or work on it in any capacity.&lt;ref name=Criterion/&gt;&lt;ref name=AVClub/&gt; Shawn initially thought that the call was a prank, due to Malle's stature in film. Malle later suggested that the dinner setup would not work, based on a rehearsal where Gregory was talking while eating.&lt;ref name=Criterion/&gt; Shawn argued throughout screenplay development for more scenes, which would have resulted in a three-hour film. Malle won many script cuts, but lost two arguments over scenes that were kept in the film.&lt;ref name=Criterion/&gt;

''My Dinner with Andre'' was filmed in the [[Jefferson Hotel (Richmond, Virginia)|Jefferson Hotel]], which was then vacant, in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. (The hotel has since been restored and reopened as a luxury venue.) [[Lloyd Kaufman]] was the production manager on the film, and [[Troma Entertainment]] provided production support.&lt;ref name="damn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fifty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spin"/&gt; The filming was done over a period of two weeks, and edited to appear as if occurring in real time. The set was created to look like the iconic [[Café des Artistes]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1178-my-dinner-with-andre-long-strange-trips Taubin, Amy, "My Dinner with Andre: Long Strange Trips", ''The Criterion Collection'' (June 26, 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Roger Ebert]] and [[Gene Siskel]] gave high praise to the film on ''[[Sneak Previews]]''; the producers told Ebert that their praise helped keep the film in theaters for a year.&lt;ref name="barnes20130404"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/roger-ebert-dies-film-critic-406274 | title=Critic Roger Ebert Dies at 70 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | date=2013-04-04 | accessdate=April 4, 2013 | author=Barnes, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert later named it as the best film of the year. In 1999, he added it to his ''Great Movies'' essay series. He said, "Someone asked me the other day if I could name a movie that was entirely devoid of clichés. I thought for a moment, and then answered, ''My Dinner with Andre''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-my-dinner-with-andre-1981 "My Dinner with Andre."] ''Chicago Sun-Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boston Society of Film Critics Awards]] ranked it as the "Best American Film" in 1982, and awarded Gregory and Shawn its prize for Best [[Screenplay]].

== Notes ==
Throughout the film, Andre references his wife "Chiquita"; in real life he was married to Mercedes "Chiquita" Nebelthau, who died in 1992.&lt;ref name=Chiquita&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/12/arts/mercedes-gregory-film-maker-dead-documentarian-56.html |title=Mercedes Gregory, Film Maker, Dead; Documentarian, 56 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 12, 1992 |accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nebelthau was a documentary filmmaker whose credits include three films about [[Jerzy Grotowski]], whom Wally and Andre talk about in this film.&lt;ref name=Chiquita/&gt;

Throughout the film, Wally references his "girlfriend Debbie". Though not actually identified, Debbie is the acclaimed short story writer [[Deborah Eisenberg]], although she had not begun publishing stories at the time of the film. Eisenberg is also an extra in the film, a dark-haired diner Shawn glances at as he scans the restaurant while standing at the bar waiting for Andre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1178-my-dinner-with-andre-long-strange-trips |title=My Dinner with André: Long, Strange Trips |first=Amy |last=Taubin |work=[[The Criterion Collection]] |date=2009 |accessdate=2018-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open Engagement''' is an international conference and artist project focusing on [[Social practice#Art and social practice|art and social practice]]. Directed and founded by [[Jen Delos Reyes]] in 2007, the conference incorporates workshops, exhibitions, residencies, pedagogy, curatorial practice and collaborative projects.

The conference is free of charge and has hosted over 700 presenters, taking place in two countries over the past seven years. Since the first Open Engagement conference in 2007, the event has become a locus for people interested in socially engaged art.&lt;ref&gt;http://badatsports.com/index.php?s=open+season&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&lt;/ref&gt; The conference offers a primary site where practitioners convene annually to take stock of the field, playing host to artists and activists.

==History==

'''2007'''&lt;br/&gt;
The initial conference, born out of Delos Reyes' graduate studies at the [[University of Regina]], was hosted by the University, the Dunlop Art Gallery, The Mackenzie Art Gallery and local Regina residents from October 11–13, 2007. Each of the three days focused on a unique theme of exploration; October 11, You are all that I see: Art and everyday experience; October 12, It takes two: Collaborations, collectives, other team relationships; October 13. I’ll call you: Long-term relationships, communities, and connectivity. Over 40 national and international contributors were present during this first conference. The contributors were selected through an open call for submissions, participating alongside three keynote presenters.&lt;ref&gt;http://jendelosreyes.com/openengagement/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2010'''&lt;br/&gt;
In 2010 Open Engagement moved to [[Portland State University]], planned in conjunction with the Art and Social Practice students, continuing under the leadership of Delos Reyes. The artists involved in Open Engagement: Making Things, Making Things Better, Making Things Worse, challenged traditional ideas of what art is and does. The artists' projects mediated the contemporary frameworks of art as service, as social space, as activism, as interactions, and as relationships.
 
Over 150 presenters were accepted through an open call for submissionS. Featured keynote presenters were [[Mark Dion]], [[Nils Norman]], and [[Amy Franceschini]].&lt;ref&gt;http://openengagement.info/home/archive&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2011'''&lt;br/&gt;
Open Engagement 2011 explored broadly art and social practice. Through conversations, interviews, open reflection on experiences, and related projects created for or presented at the conference, five themes were examined: Peoples and Publics, Social Economies, In Between Places, Tracking and Tracing, and Sentiment and Strategies. 2011’s keynote presenters were [[Julie Ault]], [[Fritz Haeg]], and Pablo Helguera.

In 2011 Open Engagement also played host to the [[Bureau for Open Culture]], Bad at Sports, an exhibition by the [[Bruce High Quality Foundation University]], and concurrent summits on art and
education and social practice/participatory programs and practices arising at museums. The summits featured representatives from [[Otis College of Art and Design]], the [[University of California, Santa Cruz|University of California Santa Cruz]], [[Maryland Institute College of Art|MICA]], [[California College of the Arts]], The Walker, [[Portland Art Museum]], [[Hammer Museum|The Hammer]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Delos Reyes, Jen. 2012. Open Engagement: An Anthology. Portland: Publication Studio.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2012'''&lt;br/&gt;
The 2012 Open Engagement featured presentations from keynote speakers [[Tania Bruguera]], Shannon Jackson and Paul Ramirez Jonas. The work by these artists and scholars informed
the conference themes: Politics, Economies, Education, and Representation.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.frieze.com/open-engagement-2012-portland/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2013'''&lt;br/&gt;
Open Engagement 2013 featured keynote presenters Claire Doherty,&lt;ref&gt;http://badatsports.com/2013/episode-417-claire-doherty/&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Finkelpearl, and
[[Michael Rakowitz]]. They were brought together to reflect on the themes of publics, contexts, and institutions in relation to the current state of socially engaged art, education, and institutional practice.

The conference included dozens of panels, workshops, and lectures, as well as a continuation of the socially engaged art in art institutions summit as well as a public conversation with [[Creative Time]] on the roles of the Creative Time Summit and Open Engagement.

'''2014'''&lt;br /&gt;
Open Engagement 2014 featured keynote presenters [[J. Morgan Puett]] and [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://temporaryartreview.com/in-defense-of-the-possible-at-open-engagement/|title=In Defense of the Possible at Open Engagement {{!}} Temporary Art Review|website=temporaryartreview.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These and other artists, scholars and conference participants reflected on the theme of Life/Work. In 2014 the conference became mobile and was hosted by Queens Museum in the borough of Queens, New York City.  

'''2015'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 2015, Open Engagement moved to Pittsburgh to explore the themes of place and revolution. [http://www.abladeofgrass.org/ A Blade of Grass] was the year's organizational partner and the conference featured keynote presentations by [[Emily Jacir]] and [[Rick Lowe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abladeofgrass.org/lay-of-the-land/open-engagement-2015-heads-to-pittsburgh/|title=Open Engagement 2015 Heads to Pittsburgh - A Blade of Grass|work=A Blade of Grass|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2016'''&lt;br /&gt;
The 2016 iteration of Open Engagement took place at the Oakland Museum of California. The 2016 conference theme, POWER, was guided by the curatorial vision of René de Guzman and featured keynote speakers [[Angela Davis]] and [[Suzanne Lacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://museumca.org/2016/open-engagement-power|title=Open Engagement—POWER {{!}} Oakland Museum of California|website=museumca.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2017'''&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:Ad Encyclopaedia-Britannica 05-1913.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]], now out of print and out of copyright.]]

An '''out-of-print book''' is a book that is no longer being [[published]]. The term can apply to specific editions of more popular works, which may then go in and out of print repeatedly, or to the sole printed edition of a work, which is not picked up again by any future publishers for reprint. Most works that have ever been published are out of print at any given time, while certain highly popular books, such as the Bible, are always "in print". Less popular [[out of print]] books are often rare and may be difficult to acquire unless scanned or [[e-book|electronic copies]] of the books are available. With the advent of [[book scanning]], and [[print-on-demand]] technology, fewer and fewer works are now considered truly out of print.

A publisher creates a [[print run]] of a fixed number of copies of a new book. Print runs for most modern books number in the thousands. These books can be ordered in [[Bulk purchasing|bulk]] by [[bookseller]]s, and when all the bookseller's copies are sold, the bookseller has the option to order additional copies. If the initial print run sells out and demand still exists, the publisher will have more copies printed, if possible. When the book is no longer selling either at a rate fast enough to pay for the [[inventory]] costs, or to justify another print run, the publisher will cease to print additional copies, and may [[Remaindered book|remainder]] or [[Pulping|pulp]] the remaining unsold copies. When all of the books in a print run have been sold to booksellers, the book is said to be "out of print", meaning that a bookseller cannot get any further copies from the publisher. If a book sells out unexpectedly quickly, it may be considered out of print briefly when its initial print run is exhausted, but is usually soon reprinted.

Publishers may choose to list a book as "out of stock indefinitely", instead of declaring it out of print, as the publisher may have to give up copyright when declaring it out of print. Publishers will often let a book go out of stock for long periods, then reprint the book, usually with a new cover and formatting, to catch the presumably built up demand for the book. The author or their estate may have copyright reverted to them once the publisher has declared it out of print.

The longer a book has been out of print, the more difficult it may be to obtain a copy. If there is enough demand for an out-of-print book, and all [[copyright]] issues can be resolved, another publisher may republish the book in the same manner as the original publisher might have reprinted it. In some cases, an out-of-print book, even one that sold very poorly, may be republished if the author becomes popular again.

A reader who wishes to purchase an out-of-print book must either find a bookseller that still has a copy, wait for another print run, or find someone who will sell their own copy as a [[used book]]. The advent of the Internet has made this process much easier, as many websites sell used books offered by bookstores and individuals.

Some publishers intentionally limit the print run of some or all titles to fewer copies than the anticipated demand, in creating [[Special edition|limited edition]]s marketed to [[Book collecting|collectors]]. In these cases, there is an implicit or explicit promise to collectors that the book will not be reprinted, at least in the same form as originally published. For instance, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s book ''[[Sex (book)|Sex]]'', with a limited edition print run, is, according to [[BookFinder.com]], the most sought after out-of-print book in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://report.bookfinder.com/2006/ BookFinder.com releases Top 10 Out-of-Print Books of 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119033812/http://report.bookfinder.com/2006/ |date=2008-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookfinder.com/books/bookfinder_report_2011/ BookFinder.com releases Top 10 Out-of-Print Books of 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Ondrusch''' (born June 4, 1875, [[Głubczyce|Leobschütz]] - died September 29, 1952, [[Untermühlhausen]]&lt;ref name="DPlace"&gt;The name of the place differs in various sources.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Germany|German]] sculptor who created religious works of art. Ondrusch was an active artist in [[Silesia]]n towns and villages at the time when they belonged to the [[German Empire]] and later when they were part of [[Weimar Republic]] and the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] since 1919 and 1933 respectively. After the [[World War II|Second World War]] he moved to Germany when his hometown was included in the territory of post-war communist-ruled [[Poland]] in 1945.

==Biography==

===Early years===
[[Image:Christ Paul Ondruschs carving.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Ondrusch's wooden carving of the crucified Christ, parish church in [[Głubczyce]], formerly his home town of Leobschütz]]Ondrusch was born to Paul Ondrusch and Anna Granel as their third child.&lt;ref&gt;Genealogy.net:  [http://www.ortsfamilienbuecher.de/famreport.php?ofb=leobschuetz&amp;ID=I58630&amp;nachname=ONDRUSCH&amp;modus=&amp;lang=de. ''Lokal Heritage Book Leobschütz/ Paul Alois Anton Ondrusch'']&lt;/ref&gt; His father was an artist who specialized in [[carpentry]] and wished his son would go into the same profession, preparing him for it in his own workshop. Paul's talent was soon discovered when he started to carve wooden sculptures. After finishing primary school education, he was sent to a school in [[Würbenthal]] in which he was taught [[Woodcut|xylography]]. A year later, he was able to leave that school because of his extraordinary abilities. In 1890 he made a wooden sculpture of the Christ for the Catholic Church in Leobschütz (now [[Głubczyce]] in [[Poland]]). Apart from that sculpture, he also contributed to numerous projects as well as the creation of other works including a [[pulpit]] in the Trinity Church (nowadays the closed Church of St. Anne) and [[Saint Florian]]'s altar in Leobschütz.&lt;ref name="Schmidt, J"&gt;Schmidt, J.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic studies===
Having finished Würbenthal school, in November 1894  Ondrusch started his studies at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Munich|Academy of Fine Arts in Munich]] where he was recognized and awarded for his life-size statue of the biblical figure, [[Judas Iscariot]],&lt;ref&gt;''Oberschlesien im Bild'', pg. 6&lt;/ref&gt; during the fourth year of his study. His teacher was Syrius Eberle. At the age of twenty-two, he was welcomed with open arms anywhere he went. Despite his early age, he was many a time offered the position of professor. However, he did not accept the offers. He decided to devote his artistic work to religious art.&lt;ref name="Schmidt, J"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maler, K. 1996"&gt;Maler, K. 1996&lt;/ref&gt; That choice was inspired by Ondrusch's deep [[Catholicism|Catholic]] beliefs which had been instilled in him by his devout family. Most of his works were crosses, altars, pulpits and figures of the saints with a particular emphasis on the figures of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|The Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref name="Schmidt, J"&gt;Schmidt, J.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further work===
As an Academy graduate, he returned to his place of birth, Leobschütz, where he again started to work in his father Karl's workshop where he painted and carved in wood and stone. It was then that many of his works came into existence. These included sculptures for local schools (e.g., a monument for the deceased students and teachers; and an altar in the chapel of a local [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]) as well as for churches located in the nearest area, but also in [[Nysa, Poland|Neisse]]; [[Chorzów|Königshütte]]; [[Bielawa|Langenbielau]]; and [[Anklam]]. He carved among other things, a figure of Saint Mary ([[sandstone]], St. Anne Church); figure of [[John the Apostle|Saint John]] ([[oak]]wood); and figures of [[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis]], [[Anthony of Padua|Saint Anthony]] and [[Michael (archangel)|Saint Michael]] defeating the devil. Other works included organ balustrades, [[confessional]]s and [[Stations of the Cross]].&lt;ref name="Schmidt, J"/&gt;

Grateful for the support from Hans Georg von Oppersdorff (born 1866), who financed Ondrusch's studies, Ondrusch became the creator of several notable works, including a lifesize statue of Jesus for the Oppersdorffs family tombstone; [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]] of the members of that family; and a statue of Saint Dorothea which was subsequently cast in [[bronze]]. All of the mentioned works have been reported missing after the war. Nevertheless, Ondrusch's artistry can be evaluated and described on the basis of the two works of art which have remained in [[Głogówek|Oberglogau]], {{convert|20|km|mi}} north of his family town, Leobschütz. One of them is a sandstone sculpture of Christ carrying the cross (1903, with a meaningful gesture of a raised hand). This work can be found on a [[defensive wall]] between a monastery and the building of a former city guard in Oberglogau (now [[Głogówek]] in [[Poland]]). The other work is a wooden figure of Saint Mary with the Infant Jesus which can be currently seen in the Regional Museum in Głogówek, but it used to be placed in a local castle's chapel.&lt;ref name="Szyndzielorz, A"&gt;Szyndzielorz, A.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Ondrusch was also the creator of other sculpted tombstones and [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]] that decorated buildings' fronts. These first ones included the figure of [[Saint John the Baptist]] placed in the old cemetery in Leobschütz in 1924.&lt;ref name="Schmidt, J"&gt;Schmidt, J.&lt;/ref&gt; Ondrusch's wooden sculpture of [[Remus von Woyrsch]], a German [[Field Marshal General]], decorated the main hall in the town hall of Leobschütz. General von Woyrsch was portrayed as a knight wearing a coat and a [[Mail (armour)|chain mail]], with his hands placed on a handle of a large sword resting against the ground.&lt;ref name="Maler, K. 1996"/&gt; That work has not withstood the destruction of the building, bombed in March 1945 and pulled down during the following years.&lt;ref&gt;Maler, K. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The mentioned busts decorating buildings' fronts were similar to [[cartouche]]s placed above main buildings' doors. Those [[bas-relief]]s, created by Ondrusch, decorated buildings constructed in the years 1922-1923 in [[Leobschütz]] and they portrayed Saint Hedwig with a church in the background; [[Saint Joseph]] with Jesus; Saint Martin with a coat with which he covers the needy; [[Saint Anne]] with Jesus; Saint Elizabeth with the roses; the [[Holy Family]] escaping from Egypt; the [[Franciscan]] saints; [[Saint George]] who kills a dragon; and the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]], this single sculpture being exceptionally done in [[Tilia|limewood]]. The material used for these carvings was taken from earthworks carried out during the construction of a sports field. The newly done carvings were then transported to the master potter's workshop where they were fired in a [[kiln]]. Afterwards, the sculptures were coloured and then placed above the doors of the building. Some of these cartouches measured {{convert|135|cm|in}} in length and {{convert|48|cm|in}} in height, whereas others were round.&lt;ref name="Schmidt, J"/&gt;

Ondrusch was commissioned by the municipal authorities of [[Gliwice|Gleiwitz]] to do a sculpture of [[Crucifixion|crucified]] [[Jesus|Christ]] and mourning witnesses, which was erected at the Lime trees Cemetery in Petersdorf (now Szobiszowice; a district of Gleiwitz). He was also asked to sculpt a monument dedicated to seventy-six children who were killed in a theatre in 1919. The latter work is one that is characterized as modest in its message. It portrays the children embraced by Jesus and is situated in front of a flat stone. Originally, it also included an inscription in [[German language|German]] which could be translated as follows: "Come to me children," and "In memory of 76 children of Gleiwitz who died a violent death on March 24, 1919."&lt;ref&gt;Pokorska, E.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from these works, Ondrusch also created several other works for the All Saints' Church in Gleiwitz (now Polish [[Gliwice]]).&lt;ref name="Schmidt, J"&gt;Schmidt, J.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ondrusch presented his works at annual exhibitions in Gleiwitz; [[Zabrze|Hindenburg]]; and [[Opole|Oppeln]]. It is reported that his works can be found in [[Oldenburg]], [[Eschershausen]] and [[Wiesbaden]] as well as in private collections.&lt;ref name="Schmidt, J"/&gt;

===Family life===
Ondrusch had eleven siblings. He married Martha Olbrich in 1902 and they had four daughters (Lucia born in 1902, Else - 1903, Margarethe - 1908 and Charlotte - 1912) and two sons (Paul born 1916 and Heinz - 1920). He was recruited during the [[World War I]] (1914–1918). His oldest daughter died in 1916. His mother, Anna, died the same year, and his wife in 1923. Two years after her death, he remarried and started a second family with Emma Werdecker with whom he had a daughter Ingeborg (1928) and a son, Gerhard (1932).&lt;ref name="Schmidt, J"&gt;Schmidt, J.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Ondrusch moved to Germany in 1945 and there he continued his work. He died at the age of seventy-seven.&lt;ref name="Schmidt, J"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Szyndzielorz, A"/&gt;

'''Philippine American Women Writers and Artists''' also known as '''PAWWA''' was founded in 1991 by a group of seven [[Filipino people|Filipina]] writers in Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Yuson|first= Alfred|title= Fil-Am: The Filipino American Experience|page=149|place= Makati City|publisher=Publico|year= 1999|isbn= 9719211008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first such support group for Filipina women writers. Aside from supporting one another, the group wanted to help other Filipina writers and artists, as well as to provide community service. PAWWA encouraged the creation of PAWWA-North, headed by Ceres Alabado in the [[Bay Area]], California.

PAWWA's founding members are: Valorie Slaughter Bejarano, [[Cecilia Manguerra Brainard]], Mariquita Athena Davison, Fe Panalingan Koons, Susan N. Montepio, Cecile Caguingin Ochoa, and Nentuzka C. Villamar. 

For six years, PAWWA received the highly competitive Multicultural Entry Grant from the [[California Arts Council]] (CAC). PAWWA used that funding to help publish a newsletter and books: ''Seven Stories from Seven Sisters: A Collection of Philippine Folktales'' (1992); ''The Beginning and Other Asian Folktales'' (1995);''A Directory of Philippine American Women Writers and Artists''; and ''Journey of 100 Years: Reflections on the Centennial of Philippine Independence'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Brainard|first= Cecilia|title= Journey of 100 Years: Reflections on the Centennial of Philippine Independence|page=ii|place= Santa Monica|publisher=PAWWA |year= 1999|isbn= 0963228102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, 1998, PAWWA and the Asian Pacific Student Services of Loyola Marymount University held a one-day conference entitled "Journey of 100 Years."  Presenters were : [[Cecilia Manguerra Brainard]], Maria Luisa Carino (or Maria Luisa Igloria), Rosita Galang, Paulino Lim, Jr., Edmundo Litton, Herminia Menez, Susan Montepio, and Nadine Sarreal.  An offshoot of that conference was the book, ''Journey of 100 Years''. 

When PAWWA's CAC funding ran out in June 1998, the remaining members of PAWWA decided to move on, and PAWWA was dissolved.

'''''Primavera''''' ({{IPA-it|primaˈveːra}}, meaning "Spring"), is a large [[panel painting]] in [[tempera]] paint by the [[Italian Renaissance]] painter [[Sandro Botticelli]] made in the late 1470s or early 1480s (datings vary). It has been described as "one of the most written about, and most controversial paintings in the world",{{sfn|Fossi|1998|p=5}} and also "one of the most popular paintings in Western art".{{sfn|Cunningham &amp; Reich|2009|p=282}}

The painting depicts a group of figures from [[classical mythology]] in a garden, but no story has been found that brings this particular group together.&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt; Most critics agree that the painting is an [[allegory]] based on the lush growth of Spring, but accounts of any precise meaning vary, though many involve the [[Renaissance Neoplatonism]] which then fascinated intellectual circles in [[Florence]]. The subject was first described as ''Primavera'' by the art historian [[Giorgio Vasari]] who saw it at [[Villa Castello]], just outside Florence, by 1550.{{sfn|Foster &amp; Tudor-Craig|1986|p=42}}

Although the two are now known not to be a pair, the painting is inevitably discussed with Botticelli's other very large mythological painting, ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'', also in the Uffizi. They are among the most famous paintings in the world, and icons of the [[Italian Renaissance]]; of the two, the ''Birth'' is even better known than the ''Primavera''.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 134; Legouix, 118&lt;/ref&gt; As depictions of subjects from [[classical mythology]] on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 119&lt;/ref&gt; It used to be thought that they were both commissioned by the same member of the Medici family, but this is now uncertain.

The history of the painting is not certainly known, though it seems to have been commissioned by one of the [[House of Medici|Medici family]]. It draws from a number of classical and Renaissance literary sources, including the works of the Ancient Roman poet [[Ovid]] and, less certainly, [[Lucretius]], and may also allude to a poem by [[Poliziano]], the Medici house poet who may have helped Botticelli devise the composition. Since 1919 the painting has been part of the collection of the [[Uffizi|Uffizi Gallery]] in [[Florence]], Italy.

==Composition==
[[File:Primavera 03.jpg|thumb|left|[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] standing in her arch.]]
The painting features six female figures and two male, along with a cupid, in an orange grove. The movement of the composition is from right to left, so following that direction the standard identification of the figures is: at far right "[[Zephyrus]], the biting wind of March, kidnaps and possesses the nymph [[Chloris]], whom he later marries and transforms into a deity; she becomes the goddess of Spring, eternal bearer of life, and is scattering roses on the ground."{{sfn|Capretti|2002|p=48}} [[Chloris]] the nymph overlaps Flora, the goddess she transforms into.

In the centre (but not exactly so) and somewhat set back from the other figures stands Venus, a red-draped woman in blue. Like the flower-gatherer, she returns the viewer's gaze. The trees behind her form a broken arch to draw the eye. In the air above her a blindfolded [[Cupid]] aims his bow to the left.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 126–128&lt;/ref&gt; On the left of the painting the [[Charites|Three Graces]], a group of three females also in diaphanous white, join hands in a dance. At the extreme left [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], clothed in red with a sword and a helmet, raises his [[caduceus]] or wooden rod towards some wispy gray clouds.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 128–135&lt;/ref&gt;

The interactions between the figures are enigmatic. Zephyrus and Chloris are looking at each other. Flora and Venus look out at the viewer, the Cupid is blindfolded, and Mercury has turned his back on the others, and looks up at the clouds. The central Grace looks towards him, while the other two seem to look at each other. Flora's smile was very unusual in painting at this date.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 138&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--  
To the right of centre of the painting, Flora, a flower-crowned female figure stands in a floral-patterned dress scattering flowers that are piled up in a folds of her dress.  She has a slight smile on her face while stepping towards the viewer. The colours of the flowers on her dress and in her hand are pink, red and white.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 137–138&lt;/ref&gt;

To the right of Flora a woman in diaphanous white is being seized from above by Zephyr, a winged male. His cheeks are puffed, his expression intent, and his unnatural complexion separates him from the rest of the figures. The trees around him blow in the direction of his entry, as does the skirt of the woman he is seizing. The drapery of her companion blows in the other direction.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 138–140&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

The pastoral scenery is elaborate. There are 500 identified plant species depicted in the painting, with about 190 different flowers,{{sfn|Capretti|2002|p=49}} of which at least 130 can be specifically identified.{{sfn|Fossi|1998|p=5}} The overall appearance, and size, of the painting is similar to that of the [[millefleur]] ("thousand flower") Flemish [[tapestries]] that were popular decorations for palaces at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 123; Ettlingers, 120, 122&lt;/ref&gt;

These tapestries had not caught up by the 1480s with the artistic developments of the Italian Renaissance, and the composition of the painting has aspects that belong to this still Gothic style. The figures are spread in a rough line across the front of the picture space, "set side by side like pearls on a string".&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 122&lt;/ref&gt; It is now known that in the setting for which the painting was designed the bottom was about at eye level, or slightly above it, partly explaining "the gently rising plane" on which the figures stand.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 122&lt;/ref&gt;

The feet of Venus are considerably higher than those of the others, showing she is behind them, but she is at the same scale, if not larger, than the other figures. Overlapping of other figures by Mercury's sword and Chloris' hands shows that they stand slightly in front of the left Grace and Flora respectively, which might not be obvious otherwise, for example from their feet. It has been argued that the flowers do not grow smaller to the rear of the picture space, certainly a feature of the millefleur tapestries.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 119–120&lt;/ref&gt;

The costumes of the figures are versions of the dress of contemporary Florence, though the sort of "quasi-theatrical costumes designed for masquerades of the sort that Vasari wrote were invented by Lorenzo de’ Medici for civic festivals and tournaments."&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt;  The lack of an obvious narrative may relate to the world of pageants and ''[[tableau vivant]]s'' as well as typically static Gothic allegories.

==Meaning==
[[File:Sandro Botticelli - Three Graces in Primavera.jpg|thumb|[[Charites|The Three Graces]]]]
Various interpretations of the figures have been set forth,&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 118–119 gives a spirited quick summary&lt;/ref&gt; but it is generally agreed that at least at one level the painting is "an elaborate mythological [[allegory]] of the burgeoning fertility of the world."{{sfn|Cunningham &amp; Reich|2009|p=282}} It is thought that Botticelli had help devising the composition of the painting and whatever meanings it was intended to contain, as it appears that the painting reflects a deep knowledge of classical literature and philosophy that Botticelli is unlikely to have possessed. Poliziano is usually thought to have been involved in this,&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Marsilio Ficino]], another member of Lorenzo de' Medici's circle and a key figure in Renaissance Neoplatonism, has also often been mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;Wind, 113–114, 126–127; Ettlingers, 129&lt;/ref&gt;

One aspect of the painting is a depiction of the progress of the season of spring, reading from right to left. The wind of early Spring blows on the land and brings forth growth and flowers, presided over by Venus, goddess of April, with at the left Mercury, the god of the month of May in an early Roman calendar, chasing away the last clouds before summer.&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt; As well as being part of a sequence over the season, Mercury in dispelling the clouds is acting as the guard of the garden, partly explaining his military dress and his facing out of the picture space. A passage in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' describes him clearing the skies with his caduceus.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 136–137&lt;/ref&gt; A more positive, Neoplatonist, view of the clouds is that they are "the benificent veils through which the splendour of transcendent truth may reach the beholder without destroying him."&lt;ref&gt;Wind, 123–124, 123 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] presides over the garden – an orange grove (a Medici symbol). It is also the [[Garden of the Hesperides]] of classical myth, from which the golden apples used in the [[Judgement of Paris]] came; the [[Hellenistic]] Greeks had decided that these were [[citrus]] fruits, exotic to them.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 126&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Claudian]], no clouds were allowed there.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 332&lt;/ref&gt; Venus stands in front of the dark leaves of a [[Myrtus|myrtle]] bush. According to [[Hesiod]], Venus had been born of the sea after the semen of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] had fallen upon the waters. Coming ashore in a shell she had clothed her nakedness in myrtle, and so the plant became sacred to her.{{sfn|Foster &amp; Tudor-Craig|1986|p=44}} Venus appears here in her character as a goddess of marriage, clothed and with her hair modestly covered, as married women were expected to appear in public.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 127–128, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

The Three Graces are sisters, and traditionally accompany Venus. In classical art (but not literature) they are normally nude, and typically stand still as they hold hands, but the depiction here is very close to one adapting [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] in his ''[[De pictura]]'' (1435), which Botticelli certainly knew.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 130–132; Ettlingers, 120&lt;/ref&gt; From the left they are identified by [[Edgar Wind]] as [[Voluptas]], Castitas, and Pulchritudo (Pleasure, Chastity and Beauty),&lt;ref&gt;Wind, 117–119&lt;/ref&gt; though other names are found in mythology, and it is noticeable that many writers, including Lightbown and the Ettlingers, refrain from naming Botticelli's Graces at all.
[[File:Pallasetlecentaure.jpg|thumb|Botticelli's ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'' (1482) has been proposed as the companion piece to ''Primavera''.{{sfn|Deimling|2000|p=45}}]]

Cupid's arrow is aimed at the middle Grace, Chastity according to Wind, and the impact of love on chastity, leading to a marriage, features in many interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 133; Wind, 119–121&lt;/ref&gt; Chastity looks towards Mercury, and some interpretations, especially those identifying the figures as modelled on actual individuals, see this couple as one to match Chloris and Zephyrus on the other side of the painting.

In a different interpretation the earthy carnal love represented by Zephyrus to the right is renounced by the central figure of the Graces, who has turned her back to the scene, unconcerned by the threat represented to her by Cupid. Her focus is on Mercury, who himself gazes beyond the canvas at what many believe hung as the companion piece to ''Primavera'': ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'', in which "love oriented towards knowledge" (embodied by [[Pallas Athena]]) proves triumphant over lust (symbolized by the [[centaur]]).&lt;ref&gt;Deimling, 45–46.  But Mercury seems clearly to be looking above him, as he works on the clouds.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic identification of the figures is now widely agreed,&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 126–140; Ettlingers, 122–124; Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt; but in the past other names have sometimes been used for the females on the right, who are two stages of the same person in the usual interpretation. The woman in the flowered dress may be called Primavera (a personification of Spring), with Flora the figure pursued by Zephyrus.{{sfn|Steinmann|1901|p=82-84}}&lt;ref&gt;Wind, 116–117. Vasari's "recollection that the picture 'signifies spring' (''dinotando la primavera'')" is blamed for some writers wanting to identify a figure as the personification of Primavera. For [[Kenneth Clark]], 96, Chloris is "Spring"; Ettlingers, 124&lt;/ref&gt;  One scholar suggested in 2011 that the central figure is not Venus at all, but [[Persephone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kline|first=Jonathan|date=2011|title=Botticelli's "Return of Persephone": On the Source and Subject of the "Primavera"|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23076486|journal=The Sixteenth Century Journal|volume=42|issue=3|pages=665–688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its overt meaning, the painting has been interpreted as an illustration of the ideal of Neoplatonic love popularized among the Medicis and their followers by Marsilio Ficino.{{sfn|Deimling|2000|p=45}} The Neoplatonic philosophers saw Venus as ruling over both earthly and divine love and argued that she was the classical equivalent of the Virgin Mary; this is alluded to by the way she is framed in an altar-like setting that is similar to contemporary images of the Virgin Mary.{{sfn|Harris &amp; Zucker}}&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 332&lt;/ref&gt; Venus' hand gesture of welcome, probably directed to the viewer, is the same as that used by Mary to the [[Archangel Gabriel]] in contemporary paintings of the ''[[Annunciation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 128; Clark, 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Punning allusions to Medici names probably include the golden balls of the oranges, recalling those on the Medici coat of arms, the laurel trees at right, for either Lorenzo, and the flames on the costume of both Mercury (for whom they are a regular attribute) and Venus, which are also an attribute of [[Saint Laurence]] (Lorenzo in Italian). Mercury was the god of medicine and "doctors", ''medici'' in Italian. Such puns for the Medici, and in ''[[Venus and Mars (Botticelli)|Venus and Mars]]'' the Vespucci, run through all Botticelli's mythological paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 332–333&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
Of the very many literary sources that may have fed into the painting,&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 332&lt;/ref&gt; the clearest was first noted in modern times by [[Aby Warburg]] in 1893, in his seminal dissertation on the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 140; Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt; The group at the right of the painting was inspired by a description by the Roman poet Ovid of the arrival of Spring (''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', Book 5, May 2). In this the wood nymph Chloris recounts how her naked charms attracted the first wind of Spring, Zephyr. Zephyr pursued her and as she was ravished, flowers sprang from her mouth and she became transformed into Flora, goddess of flowers.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 140&lt;/ref&gt; In Ovid's work the reader is told 'till then the earth had been but of one colour'. From Chloris' name the colour may be guessed to have been green – the Greek word for green is ''khloros'', the root of words like [[chlorophyll]] – and may be why Botticeli painted Zephyr in shades of bluish-green.{{sfn|Foster &amp; Tudor-Craig|1986|p=45}}

Other specific elements may have been derived from a poem by [[Poliziano]].{{sfn|Steinmann|1901|p=80}} As Poliziano's poem, "Rusticus", was published in 1483 and the painting is generally held to have been completed by around 1482,{{sfn|Fossi|1998|p=5}}&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, captions to his pictures&lt;/ref&gt; some scholars have argued that the influence was reversed,{{sfn|Cheney|1985|p=52}} bearing in mind that Poliziano is generally thought to have helped with devising the allegory in the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt;

Another inspiration for the painting seems to have been the poem by Lucretius "[[De rerum natura]]", which includes the lines, "Spring-time and Venus come, and Venus' boy, / The winged harbinger, steps on before, / And hard on Zephyr's foot-prints Mother Flora, / Sprinkling the ways before them, filleth all / With colors and with odors excellent."{{sfn|Deimling|2000|p=43}}{{sfn|Lucretius}}&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 137, 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Where there is a plethora of literary sources, most of them probably not known directly by Botticelli, or set out for him by advisors, the visual sources are a different matter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But where, in the visual rather than the literary sense, did the vision come from? That is the mystery of genius.  From antique sarcophagi, from a few gems and reliefs, and perhaps some fragments of [[Aretine ware]]; from those drawings of classical remains by contemporary artists which were circulated in the Florentine workshops, like the architects' pattern-books of the 18th century; from such scanty and mediocre material, Botticelli has created one of the most personal evocations of physical beauty in the whole of art, the Three Graces of the ''Primavera''. ([[Kenneth Clark]])&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
[[File:Sandro Botticelli 041.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] may have been modeled after [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]],{{sfn|Fisher|2011|p=12}} or possibly his cousin [[Giuliano de' Medici (1453–1478)|Giuliano de' Medici]].{{sfn|Heyl|1912|p=89-90}}]]
The origin of the painting is unclear. Botticelli was away in Rome for many months in 1481/82, painting in the [[Sistine Chapel]], and suggested dates are in recent years mostly later than this, but still sometimes before. Thinking has been somewhat changed by the publication in 1975 of an inventory from 1499 of the collection of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 142; [http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/b/botticel/5allegor/20pallas.html Inventory publication]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1499 inventory records it hanging in the city palace of [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463–1503)|Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]] and his brother [[Giovanni il Popolano|Giovanni "Il Popolano"]]. They were the cousins of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] ("Lorenzo il Magnifico"), who was effectively the ruler of Florence, and after their father's early death had been his wards.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 120–122&lt;/ref&gt; It hung over a large ''lettuccio'', an elaborate piece of furniture including a raised base, a seat and a backboard, probably topped with a [[cornice]]. The bottom of the painting was probably at about the viewer's eye-level, so rather higher than it is hung today.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 122&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same room was Botticelli's ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'', and also a large [[tondo (art)|tondo]] with the ''Virgin and Child''. The tondo is now unidentified, but is a type of painting especially associated with Botticelli. This was given the highest value of the three paintings, at 180 lire. A further inventory of 1503 records that the ''Primavera'' had a large white frame.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 122&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first edition of his ''Life of Botticelli'', published in 1550, Giorgio Vasari said that he had seen this painting, and the ''[[Birth of Venus]]'', hanging in the Medici country [[Villa di Castello]]. Before the inventory was known it was usually believed that both paintings were made for the villa, probably soon after it was acquired in 1477, either commissioned by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco or perhaps given to him by his older cousin and guardian [[Lorenzo de' Medici]]. Rather oddly, Vasari says both paintings contained female nudes, which is not strictly the case here.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 142; Vasari, 148&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Oberhausen - Gasometer - Der schöne Schein - Primavera (Botticelli) 03 ies.jpg|thumb|[[Chloris]] and [[Zephyrus]]]]
Most scholars now connect the painting to the marriage of [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]]. Paintings and furniture were often given as presents celebrating weddings. The marriage was on 19 July 1482, but had been postponed after the death of the elder Lorenzo's mother on 25 March. It was originally planned for May.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 122; Dempsey&lt;/ref&gt; Recent datings tend to prefer the early 1480s, after Botticelli's return from Rome, suggesting it was directly commissioned in connection with this wedding, a view supported by many.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;

Another older theory, assuming an early date, suggests the older Lorenzo commissioned the portrait to celebrate the birth of his nephew [[Pope Clement VII|Giulio di Giuliano de' Medici]] (who later became [[Pope]]), but changed his mind after the assassination of Giulo's father, his brother [[Giuliano de' Medici (1453–1478)|Giuliano]] in 1478, having it instead completed as a wedding gift for Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco.{{sfn|Capretti|2002|p=48}}&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 121–122&lt;/ref&gt;

It is frequently suggested that Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco is the model for Mercury in the portrait, and his bride Semirande represented as Flora (or Venus).{{sfn|Fisher|2011|p=12}} In older theories, placing the painting in the 1470s, it was proposed that the model for Venus was [[Simonetta Vespucci]], wife of Marco Vespucci and according to popular legend the mistress of Giuliano de' Medici (who is also sometimes said to have been the model for Mercury);{{sfn|Heyl|1912|p=89-90}} these identifications largely depend on an early date, in the 1470s, as both were dead by 1478. Simonetta was the aunt of Lorenzo's bride Semirande.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 120–122&lt;/ref&gt; Summarizing the many interpretations of the painting, [[Leopold Ettlinger]] includes "descending to the ludricous – a Wagnerian pantomime enacted in memory of the murdered Giuliano de' Medici and his beloved Simonetta Vespucci with the Germanic Norns disguised as the Mediterranean Graces."&lt;ref&gt;Ettlingers, 118–119&lt;/ref&gt;

Whenever this painting and the ''Birth of Venus'' were united at Castello, they have remained together ever since. They stayed in Castello until 1815, when they were transferred to the Uffizi. For some years until 1919 they were kept in the [[Galleria dell'Accademia]], another government museum in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Legouix, 115–118&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1919, it has hung in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. During the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian campaign]] of World War Two, the picture was moved to Montegufoni Castle about ten miles south west of Florence to protect it from wartime bombing.{{sfn|Healey|2011}}

It was returned to the Uffizi Gallery where it remains to the present day. In 1978, the painting was [[restoration (art)|restored]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 143–145&lt;/ref&gt; The work has darkened considerably over the course of time.{{sfn|Steinmann|1901|p=80}}

'''The Providence Black Repertory Company (Black Rep)''' was a 501c3 [[non profit]] [[arts]] organization based in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], USA. It offered programming inspired by the cultural traditions of the [[African Diaspora]] in Theater, Education, and Public Programs. It operated from 1996 till 2009.

==History==
Founded in 1996 by Artistic/Executive Director Donald W. King, and Chairman Michael S. Van Leesten, The Providence Black Repertory Company grew from a public program at [[AS220]] called Xxodus Presents Miss Fannie's Soul Food Kitchen. Black Rep produced its first stage production, The Island, on the third floor of a former print shop on Washington St. in [[Downcity Providence]].

Ten years later, Black Rep was located at 276 Westminster St. in a facility that includes performance and rehearsal space as well as a café and lounge. Black Rep offers programming such as a Latin Jazz series, drumming workshops for youth, premiers of new American plays, and Sound Session, a music festival produced in partnership with The City of Providence's Department of Art, Culture &amp; Tourism.  Across the three program areas Black Rep contextualizes artistic work through humanities panels, discussions, printed materials, and outreach.

In 2006, Black Rep celebrated its 10th Anniversary as a Downcity Providence cultural institution.

According to a 2/1/2010 article published in the Providence Journal, "Established in 1996, '''the Black Rep was closed in December 2009''' after the organization failed to keep a positive cash flow. The group was granted a hardship request to throw its annual New Year’s Eve party, in the hopes that revenue from the event could have helped pay off some debt. It wasn’t enough...".

==Theater==

The Theater experience at the Black Rep is informed by an approach that places the deliberate investigation of cultural, social, historical and political consciousness and conscience at the center of the creative process.  Each season includes three mainstage productions and three readings of new American plays through the First Look Reading Series for plays in development.  Mainstage productions have included plays by [[Amiri Baraka]], Aisha Rahman, [[Athol Fugard]], [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Sam Shepard]], Cheryl West, [[María Irene Fornés]], and [[August Wilson]], as well as original stage adaptations of the poetry of [[Langston Hughes]] and [[Kevin Young (poet)]].  Each December, The Black Rep’s Affiliate Artist company develops a workshop production showcasing its own work in process while providing a chance for audiences to be part of its development.

==Public Programs==

Black Rep’s Public Programs present live music, poetry, and other performance-based art of the African Diaspora six nights a week in the Xxodus Café. Each week night of public programming is informed by a particular musical tradition of the African Diaspora. Monday is Polyphonic, an open mic for artists working in forms of musical expression deriving from the Blues (Hip Hop, Acoustic Solo, Rock etc.). Tuesday is Maroon Society, Black Rep's Caribbean Culture series where selectors spin Reggae, Dub, Ska, and Dancehall. Wednesday is Latin Jazz &amp; Salsa. Thursdays is Afro-Sonic, a Deep House night with live West African drumming. Friday is Ecclection, a night for Hip Hop, R&amp;B, Funk and Soul. Saturday is the Neon Soul Cabaret, which plays host to Black Rep's house band, [http://www.myspace.com/neonsoulcollective Neon Soul Collective] - a group indebted to the various styles of music played in the café throughout the week.  Each season of Public Programs culminates with [http://www.providencesoundsession.com Providence Sound Session], a genre-defying summer music festival co-produced with The City of Providence's Department of Art, Culture &amp; Tourism.

==Education==

Each season is accompanied by Education programs, including student matinees, in-school residencies, and after-school workshops.  Artist Educators bring Black Rep’s interdisciplinary approach into the community through workshops in music, dance, theater, poetry and video production.  Teaching methodologies stress collaboration and value students’ cultural heritage and experience, with the goal of developing youth and adults who recognize the importance and power of the art and culture of the African Diaspora and embrace the values of community and democracy that are part of these traditions.

==Artist Development==

Black Rep is committed to Artist Development, offering opportunities for musicians and performers to participate in master classes, workshops, and career development activities.  At Black Rep, local artists have an opportunity to network, share resources, and build their careers through employment.
Artists who look to the organization to provide them with creative opportunities come from many different places of cultural origin. Almost 86% are locally or regionally based in Rhode Island and Southeastern New England, 11% are based in New York, and 3% are based in other states, or internationally. The Company has attracted artists from [[Nigeria]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. Local artists who have worked at Black Rep identify as African-American, Haitian, Cape Verdean, Hispanic/Latino, Caribbean, Native American, Caucasian/White, Mixed Heritage and Filipino.

==Partnerships==

The Black Rep had partnerships and collaborations with local cultural and educational institutions including [[Brown University]]’s Rites and Reason Theatre and [[Rhode Island College]]’s MFA Program in Performance and Society.  Collaborative projects include new play development, co-production, and mentoring of young artists.

==Awards and recognition==
The [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] in Washington D.C. recently invited Black Rep to join their Capacity Building Program for Culturally Specific Performing Arts Organizations.  Other recognition includes the 2004 Arts &amp; Business Council of RI Jabez Gorham Award for Most Outstanding Arts Organization, 2003 New England Theatre Conference Regional Award for Outstanding Achievement in American Theatre, and the 2003 Citizens Bank Community Champion Award (in Education).

A '''spoke card''', or '''spokecard''', is a [[:wikt:card|card]] placed in the [[spokes]] of a [[bicycle wheel]]. They lie parallel to the entire wheel. Most spoke cards are [[laminated]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Haine. [https://books.google.com/books?id=w3tKOxCURl4C&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=spokecard&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fzMBU53PNobi0wHqtYG4BA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=spokecard&amp;f=false ''The Urban Biking Handbook: The DIY Guide to Building, Rebuilding, Tinkering with, and Repairing Your Bicycle for City Living.''] Quarry Books, 2011. Page 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 20th century, [[playing cards]] were placed in such a way as to make a [[noise]] as the card flaps against the spokes; however, there is no evidence that these were called "spoke cards."

==Origins==
One origin of the spoke card was laminated cards inserted in spokes with numbers used to identify competitors in competitive races held by [[bicycle messenger]]s, in official competitions and in unofficial [[alleycat races]].&lt;ref&gt;FixedGearGallery. [http://www.fixedgeargallery.com/spokecards.htm Subject: Spoke Cards.] (retrieved 8 Jan 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tarot]] cards with the racers number written on them were used initially,&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Phillip. [http://www.phillipdillon.com/?p=185 "The Tarodome Alleycat."] 17 July 2009 (retrieved 21 Nov 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; but nowadays cards are often custom printed.

Another influence was the practice of placing [[playing card]]s found on the street in bicycle spokes in a game known in 1990s San Francisco as [[Spokepoker]].&lt;ref&gt;King, Parté. "Spokepoker." ''Mess Press.'' Issue 1, 1991: 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The spoke card is wedged between the spokes of the wheel at the point where they cross each other. Although the spoke card is hard to read while the bicycle is in motion, it provides a cheap way to label them in the absence of a proper race number plaque under the top tube, and is less likely to attract the attention of the authorities than a number on the rider's back.

Maps for social bicycle rides have been printed on spokecards for the riders's reference.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Haine. [https://books.google.com/books?id=w3tKOxCURl4C&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=spokecard&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fzMBU53PNobi0wHqtYG4BA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=spokecard&amp;f=false ''The Urban Biking Handbook: The DIY Guide to Building, Rebuilding, Tinkering with, and Repairing Your Bicycle for City Living.''] Quarry Books, 2011. Page 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many messengers retain spoke cards after the event, accumulating several on the wheel. Other city riders sometimes fix spoke cards to their wheels as an affectation of messenger culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theindycog.com/labels/alleycat.html "Oaks Day Alleycat."] ''IndyCog.'' 18 March 2009 (retrieved 21 Nov 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Many times participants of large group rides, such as those organized by groups like the [[Midnight Ridazz]] or [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] receive spoke cards and affix them to their spokes.

Spoke cards have evolved to serve such diverse functions as [[memorial]]s for fallen messengers, as [[Works of art|artwork]], and as political [[placard]]s in bike messenger association elections, and even in the [[2008 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://obamaspoke.com/ "One Man Spoke."] (retrieved 21 Nov 2009)  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227044848/http://obamaspoke.com/ |date=February 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Amy Walker advocates using spoke cards as advertising fliers,&lt;ref&gt;Amy Walker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7OHlBI4xCLMC&amp;lpg=PA246&amp;dq=spokecard&amp;pg=PA246#v=onepage&amp;q=spokecard&amp;f=false ''On Bicycles: 50 Ways the New Bike Culture Can Change Your Life.''] New World Library, 2011. Page 246.&lt;/ref&gt; however, this can be controversial since many cyclists do not appreciate strangers touching their bicycles.

[http://www.BikeIndex.org Bike Index], a bike registration service, provides instructions for printing spoke cards with [[QR codes]] that contain information about the particular bicycle and its registration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bikeindex.org/spokecard "Spoke cards."] ''Bike Index'' (retrieved February 16, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Accolade''''' is a painting by [[British people|British]] artist [[Edmund Leighton]]. It is one of many paintings produced by Leighton in the 1900s on the subject of [[chivalry]], with others including ''[[God Speed (painting)|God Speed]]'' (1901) and ''[[The Dedication (painting)|The Dedication]]'' (1908). It has been described as among Leighton's best known works&lt;ref name="All Art Classics"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.allartclassic.com/pictures_zoom.php?p_number=80&amp;p=&amp;number=LEE003| title ="The Accolade" |publisher =[[All Art Classics]]| accessdate = 18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Art Renewal Center"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.artrenewal.org/pages/artist.php?artistid=844| title ="Edmund Blair Leighton" |publisher =[[Art Renewal Center]]|author=Kara Ross | accessdate = 18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the most recognizable paintings of the period.&lt;ref name="Art Renewal Center"/&gt;

==Background==
There are many stories considering the origin of and inspiration for the painting, although none of them are confirmed. The painting depicts an [[accolade]], a ceremony to confer [[knighthood]]. Such ceremonies took many forms, including the tapping of the flat side of a sword on the shoulders of a candidate or an embrace about the neck. In the first example, the "knight-elect" kneels in front of the monarch on a knighting-stool. The monarch lays the side of the sword's blade onto the accolade's right shoulder. The monarch then raises the sword gently just up over the apprentice's head and places it on his left shoulder. The newly appointed knight arises, and the administrator presents him with the insignia of their knightly order. In the painting, the ceremony is performed by a young queen, the knight bowed before her feet in a position of submission and fealty. An audience is gathered on the Queen's left, serving as witnesses to the ceremony. 

==Reception==
All Art Classics describes ''Accolade'' as Leighton's best-known work&lt;ref name="All Art Classics"/&gt;  and Kara Ross, Director of Operations for the [[Art Renewal Center]], describes it as "the epitome of medieval iconography" and as one of Leighton's most famous works, which "are among the most widely recognized paintings of the period."&lt;ref name="Art Renewal Center"/&gt; [[Sotheby's]] catalogue describes it as one of "the most memorable" of his medieval subjects.&lt;ref name="Sotheby's"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2014/british-irish-art-l14132/lot.211.html| title ="A King and a Beggar Maid" |publisher =[[Sotheby's]]| accessdate = 18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also notes that among this collection, "the two qualities which can always be found... are beautifully meticulous studied detail and a sensitive capturing of humanity".&lt;ref name="Sotheby's"/&gt;

== Other ==

The painting is present as a [[puzzle]], in the film ''[[Russian Dolls (film)|Russian Dolls]]'' (2005).

'''''The Founding Ceremony of the Nation''''' (or '''''The Founding of the Nation''''', {{lang-zh|c=开国大典|p=Kāiguó Dàdiǎn}}) is a 1953 [[oil painting]] by Chinese artist [[Dong Xiwen]].  It depicts [[Mao Zedong]] and other [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] officials inaugurating the [[China|People's Republic of China]] at [[Tiananmen Square]] on October 1, 1949.  A prominent example of [[socialist realism]], it is one of the most celebrated works of official Chinese art.  The painting was repeatedly revised, and a replica painting made to accommodate further changes, as the leaders it depicted fell from power and later were [[Political rehabilitation#China|rehabilitated]].

After the Communists [[Chinese Communist Revolution|took control]] of China, they sought to memorialize their achievements through artworks.  Dong was commissioned to create a visual representation of the October 1 ceremony, which he had attended.  He viewed it as essential that the painting show both the people and their leaders.  After working for three months, he completed an oil painting in a [[folk art]] style, drawing upon Chinese art history for the contemporary subject.  The success of the painting was assured when Mao viewed it and liked it, and it was reproduced in large numbers for display in the home.

The 1954 [[purge]] of [[Gao Gang]] from the government resulted in Dong being ordered to remove him from the painting.  Gao's departure was not the last; Dong was forced to remove [[Liu Shaoqi]] in 1967.  The winds of political fortune continued to shift during the [[Cultural Revolution]], and a reproduction was painted by other artists in 1972 to accommodate another deletion.  That replica was modified in 1979 to include the purged individuals, who had been rehabilitated.  Both canvases are in the [[National Museum of China]] in Beijing.

== Background ==

Following the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949, Communists quickly took control of [[Chinese art#Communist and socialist art (1950–1980s)|art in China]].  The [[socialist realism]] that was characteristic of [[Soviet art]] came to be highly influential in the People's Republic. The new government proposed a series of paintings, preferably in oil, to memorialize the history of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), and its triumph in 1949.  To this end, in December 1950, arts official Wang Yeqiu proposed to Deputy Minister of Culture [[Zhou Yang (literary theorist)|Zhou Yang]] that there be an art exhibition the following year to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Party in China.  Wang had toured the Soviet Union and observed its art, with which he was greatly impressed, and he proposed that sculptures and paintings be exhibited depicting the CPC's history, for eventual inclusion in the planned Museum of the Chinese Revolution.  Even before gaining full control of the country, the CPC had used art as [[propaganda]], a technique especially effective as much of the Chinese population was then illiterate.  Wang's proposal was preliminarily approved in March 1951, and a committee, including the art critic and official [[Jiang Feng (artist)|Jiang Feng]], was appointed to seek suitable artists.{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|pp=785–786}}  Although nearly 100 paintings were produced for the 1951 exhibition, not enough were found to be suitable, and it was cancelled.&lt;ref name="cn19"&gt;{{cite web|title=《开国大典》油画曾四次修改 哪些人被删除了？(''Founding Ceremony'' painting has been modified four times: who was deleted?|publisher=ifeng.com|date=January 4, 2011|accessdate=January 23, 2017|language=zh|author=Wu Jijin|url=http://news.ifeng.com/history/zhongguoxiandaishi/detail_2011_01/04/3933709_0.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of oil paintings to memorialize events and make a political statement was not new; 19th-century examples include [[John Trumbull]]'s paintings for the [[United States Capitol#Art|United States Capitol]] (1817–1821) and [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s ''[[The Coronation of Napoleon]]'' (1807).{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=785}} Oil painting allowed for a blending of tones to produce a wide range of realistic, attractive colors, in a way not possible with traditional Chinese ink and brush painting.{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=789}}  Wang admired how, in Moscow museums, [[Lenin]]'s career was chronicled and made accessible to the masses through artifacts accompanied by oil paintings showing crucial moments in the Communist leader's career.  He and higher-level officials decided to use a similar technique as they planned the Museum of the Chinese Revolution.  Thus, they sought to chronicle the Party's history and showcase its accomplishments.  Paintings were commissioned, even though the museum did not yet exist and would not open until 1961.{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|pp=790–792}}  Chinese leaders were eager to be presented in paintings, wanting to be immortalized as central characters in the nation's historical drama.{{sfn|Wu Hung 2005|pp=171–172}}

None of the works initially obtained for the museum depicted the crowning moment of the revolution, the ceremony at [[Tiananmen Square]] on October 1, 1949, when [[Mao Zedong]] proclaimed the People's Republic.  Officials deemed such a work essential.&lt;ref name="cn1"/&gt; [[Dong Xiwen]], a professor at the [[China Central Academy of Fine Arts|Central Academy of Fine Arts]] (CAFA) in Beijing, was accomplished and politically reliable, and had been present at the October 1 ceremony: he was an obvious candidate.{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|pp=790–792}}&lt;ref name="cn3"/&gt;  Although Dong later complained that never in his career had he had full freedom of choice as to his paintings' subjects,{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=783}} ''The Founding of the Nation'' would make him famous.&lt;ref name="cn19"/&gt;

== Subject and techniques ==
[[File:Founding Ceremony original.jpeg|thumb|right|Dong's original painting]]

The painting depicts the inaugural ceremony of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949.  The focus is on Mao, who stands on [[Tiananmen Gate]]'s balcony, reading his proclamation into (originally) two microphones.{{sfn|Andrews|p=81}}  Dong took some liberties with the appearance of Tiananmen Gate, opening up the space in front of Mao to grant the chairman a more direct connection with his people,{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=809}} something that architect [[Liang Sicheng]] deemed a mistake for a builder, but artistically brilliant.&lt;ref name="cn19"/&gt;  Five [[Doves as symbols|doves]] fly into the sky to Mao's right.  Before him on Tiananmen Square, honor guards and members of patriotic organizations are assembled in orderly ranks, with some holding banners.  [[Qianmen]], the gate at the south end of the square, is visible, as is [[Yongdingmen]] gate (seen to the left of Mao).{{sfn|Andrews|p=81}}  Beyond the old city walls that at the time enclosed the square (they were torn down in the 1950s), the city of Beijing is visible, and in green is represented the nation of China, with those further scenes under bright sunlight and sharply defined clouds.{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=810}}  October 1 had been an overcast day in Beijing; Dong took artistic license with the weather.&lt;ref name="cn3"/&gt;

To Mao's left are seen his lieutenants in the Communist takeover.  In the original painting, the front row, which is ordered by rank, consisted of (from left) General [[Zhu De]], [[Liu Shaoqi]], Madame [[Song Qingling]] (the widow of [[Sun Zhongshan]]), [[Li Jishen]], [[Zhang Lan]] (with beard), and at far right, General [[Gao Gang]].  [[Zhou Enlai]] was furthest left in the second row, and beside him were [[Dong Biwu]], two men whose identities are uncertain, and furthest right, [[Guo Moruo]].  [[Lin Boqu]] was furthest left in the third row.{{sfn|Andrews|p=81}}  The leaders congregate close to each other, while remaining a respectful distance from Mao.  This emphasizes his primacy, as does the fact that he is depicted as taller than his lieutenants.{{sfn|Wu Hung 2005|pp=172–173}}  The point of view of the observer is well back on the balcony, from which most of the square would be obscured by the floor.  Rather than show only Mao and sky, Dong manipulated the [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], raising the horizon and intensifying the foreshortening of the balcony.  Necessarily, only the officials and not the crowd below are represented as individuals; art historian Wu Hung wrote that "the parading masses in the Square derive strength from a collective anonymity.  The combination of the two—above and below, the leaders and the people—constitutes a comprehensive representation of New China."{{sfn|Wu Hung 2005|p=173}}

Mao and his officials are surrounded by [[Paper lantern|lanterns]], symbols of prosperity;{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=783}} the [[chrysanthemum]]s on either side symbolize longevity.  The doves represent peace restored to a nation long wracked by war.{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=809}}  The new five-star [[flag of China]], rising over the people, represents the end of the [[Fengjian|feudal system]] and the rebirth of the nation as the People's Republic.&lt;ref name="cn19"/&gt;  Mao, who is presented as a statesman, not as the revolutionary leader he was during the conflict, faces Qianmen, aligning himself along Beijing's old imperial North-South Axis, symbolizing his authority.  The chairman is at the center of multiple, concentric circles in the painting, with the innermost formed by the front row of his comrades, another by the people in the square, and the outermost the old city walls.  Surrounding them are the sunlit scenes, envisioning a glorious future for China with Mao the heart of the nation.{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|pp=809–810}}

[[File:Dunhuang General Zhang Yichao army detail.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Dong borrowed techniques from the [[Mogao Caves|Dunhuang murals]] of the Tang Dynasty.]]
Although Dong had been trained in [[Western painting]], he chose a [[folk art]] style for ''The Founding of the Nation'', using bright, contrasting colors in a manner similar to that in [[Chinese New Year|New Year]]'s prints popular in China.  He stated in 1953, "the Chinese people like bright, intense colors.  This convention is in line with the theme of ''The Founding Ceremony of the Nation''.  In my choice of colors I did not hesitate to put aside the complex colors commonly adopted in Western painting as well as the conventional rules for oil painting."{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=809}}  Artists in the early years of the People's Republic, including Dong, sought to satisfy Chinese aesthetic tastes in their works and so depicted their subjects in  bright original color, avoiding complex use of light and shadow on faces as in many Western paintings.{{sfn|Wu Bing|p=65}}  By European standards, the painting's colors are overly intense and saturated.  The color [[vermilion]] was used for large areas of the columns, the carpets, and the lanterns, setting a tone for the work.  The blooming flowers, the flags and banners, and the blue and white sky all give the painting a happy atmosphere{{sfn|Wu Bing|p=66}}—a joyful, festive air, as well as giving "cultural sublimity", appropriate for a work depicting the founding of a nation.&lt;ref name="china museum 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dong Xiwen, ''The Founding Ceremony''|url=http://en.chnmuseum.cn/tabid/549/Default.aspx?AntiqueLanguageID=2421|publisher=[[National Museum of China]]|accessdate=February 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dong drew upon Chinese art history, using techniques from [[Mogao Caves|Dunhuang murals]] of the [[Tang Dynasty]], [[Ming Dynasty]] portraits, and ancient figure paintings. Patterns on the carpet, columns, lanterns, and railing evoke cultural symbols.&lt;ref name="china museum 2"/&gt;  The colors of the painting are reminiscent of crudely printed rural [[woodcut]]s; this is emphasized by the black outlines of a number of objects, including the pillars and stone railing, as those outlines are characteristic of such woodcuts.{{sfn|Andrews|p=82}}  Dong noted, "If this painting is rich in national styles, it is largely because I adopted these [native] approaches."{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=809}}

== Composition ==

[[File:Tiananmen beijing Panorama.jpg|thumb|[[Tiananmen Gate]], photographed in 2009]]

''The Founding of the Nation'' was one of several paintings commissioned for the new Museum of the Chinese Revolution from faculty members at CAFA.  Two of these, Luo Gongliu's ''Tunnel Warfare'' and Wang Shikuo's ''Sending Him Off to the Army'', were completed in 1951; ''The Founding of the Nation'' was finished the following year.{{sfn|Andrews|pp=76–79}}  These commissions were regarded as from the government and were highly prestigious.  State assistance, such as access to archives, was available.{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|pp=791–792}}

At the time CAFA chose Dong, he was painting workers at the [[Shijingshan District|Shijingshan]] power plant outside Beijing.  Dong reviewed the photographs of the event, but found them unsatisfactory as none showed both the leaders and the people gathered in the square below, which he felt was necessary.  He created a postcard-size sketch, but was dissatisfied with it, feeling it did not capture the grandeur of the occasion.  Taking advice from other artists, Dong made adjustments to his plan.&lt;ref name="cn3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culture.ifeng.com/8/detail_2013_04/19/24398291_0.shtml|publisher=ifeng.com|date=April 19, 2013|accessdate=January 23, 2017|title=揭秘《开国大典》油画：增高毛泽东删除刘少奇 (Secret ''Founding Ceremony'' painting increased Mao Zedong, removed Liu Shaoqi)|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dong rented a small room in western Beijing above a store selling [[soy sauce]].&lt;ref name="cn3"/&gt;  Jiang intervened to give Dong time and space to create the painting;{{sfn|Andrews|pp=76–79}} the artist needed three months to complete his work.  The room was smaller than the painting, which is four meters wide, and Dong would affix part of the canvas to the ceiling, working on his back.  To save commuting time, he slept in a chair.  He smoked cigarettes constantly as he worked.  His daughter brought meals, but he was often unable to eat.  Once the painting was under way, several of Dong's colleagues, including oil painter {{ill|Ai Zhongxin|zh|艾中信}}, came to visit.  They decided that the figure of Mao, the central one of the painting, was not tall enough.  Dong removed the figure of Mao from the canvas, and painted him again, increasing his height by just under an inch (2.54&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref name="cn3"/&gt;

In painting the sky and the pillars, Dong used a pen and brush, as if doing a traditional Chinese painting.  He depicted the clothing in detail; Madame Song wears gloves showing flowers, while Zhang Lan's silk robe appears carefully ironed for the momentous day.&lt;ref name="cn7"/&gt;  Dong used [[sawdust]] to enhance the texture of the carpet on which Mao stands;{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=809}} he painted the marble railing as yellowish rather than white, thus emphasizing the age of the Chinese nation.&lt;ref name="cn19"/&gt;  The leaders in the painting were asked to examine their portraits for accuracy.{{sfn|Wu Hung 2005|p=172}}

== Reception and prominence ==

When the painting was unveiled in 1953, most Chinese critics were enthusiastic.  [[Xu Beihong]], the president of CAFA and a pioneer in using realism in oil painting, admired the manner in which the work fulfilled its political mission, but complained that because of the colors, it barely resembled an oil painting.{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=810}}{{sfn|Wu Bing|p=65}}  He and others, though, saw that the painting opened a new chapter in Chinese art development.{{sfn|Wu Bing|p=66}}  Zhu Dan, head of the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, which would reproduce the painting for the masses, argued that it was more a poster than an oil painting.  Other artists stated that Dong's earlier works, such as ''Kazakh Shepherdess'' (1947) and ''Liberation'' (1949), were better examples of the new national style of art.&lt;ref name="cn7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.artxun.com/youhua-953-4761866.shtml|language=zh|date=March 24, 2008|accessdate=January 23, 2017|title=油画《开国大典》的成功与蒙难 (The success and difficulty of the oil painting ''Founding Ceremony'')|author=Ai Zhongxin|publisher=Bo Po Art Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Senior Party leaders, though, approved of the painting, as art historian Chang-Tai Hung put it, "seeing it as a testament to the young nation's evolving identity and growing confidence".{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=810}}

Soon after the unveiling, Jiang wanted to arrange an exhibition at which government officials, including Mao, could view and publicly endorse the new Chinese art.  He had connections in Mao's inner circle, and Dong and others organized it to be in conjunction with meetings at [[Zhongnanhai]] that Mao led. This was, most likely, the only time Mao attended an art exhibition after 1949.  Mao visited the exhibition three times in between meetings and especially liked ''The Founding of the Nation''—the official photograph of the event shows Mao and [[Zhou Enlai]] viewing the canvas with Dong.{{sfn|Andrews|p=80}}  The chairman stared at the painting for a long time and finally said, "It is a great nation.  It really is a great nation."{{sfn|Wu Hung 2005|p=172}}  Mao also stated that the portrayal of [[Dong Biwu]] was particularly well rendered.  As Dong Biwu was in the second row, mostly hidden by the large [[Zhu De]], Mao was most likely joking, but the favorable reaction by the country's leader assured the success of the painting.{{sfn|Andrews|p=80}}

''The Founding of the Nation'' was hailed as one of the greatest oil paintings ever by a Chinese artist by reviewers in that country, and more than 500,000 reproductions were sold in three months.{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=783}}  Mao's praise helped boost the painting and its painter.  Dong's techniques were seen as bridging the gap between the elitist medium of oil painting and popular art, and as a boost to Jiang's position that realistic art could be politically desirable.{{sfn|Andrews|p=82}}  It was reproduced in primary and secondary school textbooks.&lt;ref name="cn19"/&gt;  The painting appeared on the front page of ''[[People's Daily]]'' in September 1953, and became an officially approved interior decoration.  One English-language magazine published by the Chinese government for distribution abroad showed a model family in a modern apartment, with a large poster of ''The Founding of the Nation'' on the wall.{{sfn|Andrews|pp=80–81}}  According to Chang-Tai Hung, the painting "became a celebrated propaganda piece".{{sfn|C. Hung 2005|p=920}}

== Later history and political changes ==
In February 1954 [[Gao Gang]], the head of the State Planning Council, was purged from government; he killed himself only months later.  His presence in the painting immediately on Mao's left placed arts officials in a quandary.  Given its popularity among officials and the people, ''The Founding of the Nation'' had to be shown at the Second National Arts Exhibition (1955), but it was unthinkable that Gao, deemed a traitor, should be depicted.  Accordingly Dong was ordered to remove Gao from the painting, which he did.{{sfn|Andrews|pp=82–83}}

[[File:Founding of the Nation 1955 revision.jpeg|thumb|left|1954 revision, [[Gao Gang]] deleted]]
In erasing Gao, Dong expanded the basket of pink chrysanthemums which stands at the officials' feet, and completed the depiction of  Yongdingmen gate, in the original seen only in part behind Gao.  He was forced to expand the section of sky seen above the people assembled in Tiananmen Square, which affected the placement of Mao as the center of attention.  He compensated for this, to some extent, by adding two more microphones to Mao's right. Julia Andrews, in her book on the art of the People's Republic, suggested that Dong's solution was not entirely satisfactory as the microphones dominate the center of the painting, and Mao is diminished by the expanded space around him.  The modified painting was shown in the 1955 exhibition, and in 1958 in Moscow.  Although the painting was later altered again and does not exist in this form, this version is the one most commonly reproduced.{{sfn|Andrews|pp=82–83}}

When the Museum of the Chinese Revolution opened on Tiananmen Square in 1961, the painting was displayed on a huge wall in the gallery devoted to the Communist triumph, but in 1966, during the [[Cultural Revolution]], radicals shut down the museum, and it remained closed until 1969.{{sfn|C. Hung 2005|p=931}}  During that time, [[Liu Shaoqi]], accused of taking a "capitalist road", was purged from government.  His removal from the painting was ordered in 1967, and Dong was tasked to carry it out.{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=784}}  Dong had suffered during the Cultural Revolution: accused of being a rightist, he was expelled from the Party for two years, sent to a rural [[Labor camp|work camp]], and then was "[[Political rehabilitation#China|rehabilitated]]" by being made to labor as a steelworker.&lt;ref name="cn1"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Communist Party of China]]|accessdate=January 23, 2017|language=zh|url=http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/85037/8101458.html|title=受党内斗争影响数遭劫难的油画《开国大典》(''Founding Ceremony'', an oil painting devastated several times by the conflict within the Party)|author=Gao Jimin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dong's task was difficult, as Liu was one of the most prominent figures in the first row, standing to the left of Madame Song.  Officials wanted Liu replaced with [[Lin Biao]], much in Mao's favor at the time.  Dong was unwilling to give Lin prominence he had not then had, and though he could not refuse outright at the dangerous time of the Cultural Revolution, he eventually got permission to merely remove Liu.  The figure was too large to simply delete, so Liu was repainted as Dong Biwu, and made to appear as if in the second row.  According to Andrews, the attempt was a failure: "the new Dong Biwu does not recede into the second row as intended.  Instead, he appears as a leering, glowing figure, a strangely malevolent character in the midst of an otherwise stately group".{{sfn|Andrews|p=84}}  Officials deemed the revised work unexhibitable.  Andrews speculated that Dong may have been trying to sabotage the change, or may have been affected by the stress of the years of the Cultural Revolution.{{sfn|Andrews|p=84}}

[[File:Founding ceremony 2.jpg|thumb|right|The replica painting (1979 revision)]]
In 1972, as part of a renovation of the Museum of the Chinese Revolution, officials wanted to exhibit Dong's painting again, but they decreed that [[Lin Boqu]], whose white-haired figure was furthest left, must be removed.{{sfn|Andrews|p=84}}  This was because the [[Gang of Four]], then in control of China, blamed Lin Boqu (who had died in 1960) for opposing the marriage, in the revolutionary days, of Mao with [[Jiang Qing]] (one of the Four).  Sources differ on what took place regarding the painting: Chang-Tai Hung related that Dong, terminally ill with cancer, could not make the changes, so his student Jin Shangyi and another artist, Zhao Yu, were assigned to do the work.  The two feared damaging the original canvas, so made an exact replica but for the required changes, with Dong brought forth from his hospital for consultations.{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=784}}  According to Andrews, Jin and Zhao created the new version because Dong would not let anyone else alter his painting.{{sfn|Andrews|p=84}}  Jin later stated that the painting, while effective politically, also shows Dong's inner world.&lt;ref name="china museum 2"/&gt;

With the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976 and the subsequent accession of [[Deng Xiaoping]], many of the purged figures of earlier years were [[Political rehabilitation#China|rehabilitated]], and the authorities in 1979 decided to bring more historical accuracy to the painting.  Dong had died in 1973; his family strongly opposed anyone altering the original painting, and the government respected their wishes.  Jin was on a tour outside China, so the government assigned Yan Zhenduo to make changes to the replica.  He placed Liu, Lin Boqu and Gao in the painting{{sfn|C. Hung 2007|p=784}} and made other changes: a previously unidentifiable man in the back row now resembles Deng Xiaoping.  The replica painting was restored to the Museum of the Chinese Revolution.{{sfn|Andrews|p=85}}

The painting was reproduced on [[Postage stamps and postal history of China#People's Republic of China|Chinese postage stamps]] in 1959 and 1999, for the tenth and fiftieth anniversaries of the founding of the People's Republic.&lt;ref name="scott 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kloetzel (editor)|first=James E.|title=Scott 2007 Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue: Volume 2 C–F|publisher=Scott Publishing Co.|date=2006|location=Sidney, OH|pages=324, 365|isbn=978-0-89487-376-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 1999, the museum authorized a private company to make small-scale gold foil reproductions of the painting.  Dong's family sued, and in 2002 the courts found that Dong's heirs held the copyright to the painting, and that the museum only had the right to exhibit it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=December 28, 2002|accessdate=January 23, 2017|language=zh|url=http://www.chinacourt.org/article/detail/2002/12/id/29107.shtml|title=著名油画《开国大典》著作权案在京审结 (The famous painting ''Founding Ceremony'' copyright case concluded in Beijing|publisher=Xinhua News Service|author=Zha Xin, Li Xu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Joe McDonald of the [[Associated Press]] deemed the upholding of the copyright "a triumph for China's capitalist ambitions over its leftist history".&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;{{cite news|last=McDonald|first=Joe|title=Artist's rights upheld in China|subscription=yes|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/100EEF7976AEF474?p=AWNB|date=December 29, 2002|accessdate=January 27, 2017|publisher=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, the art museum at CAFA held a retrospective of Dong's works, exhibiting the small-scale draft of the painting, possessed by Dong's family, for the first time.  Fan Di'an, curator of the exhibition, stated, "The changes to the painting tell a bitter story, reflecting the political influences on art.

Wu Hung described ''The Founding of the Nation'' as "arguably the most celebrated work of official Chinese art".{{sfn|Wu Hung 2008|p=69}}  He noted that the painting is the only "canonized" one depicting the October 1 ceremony, and that other artists have tended to give the people's perspective, subjecting themselves to Mao's gaze.{{sfn|Wu Hung 2005|p=274}}  The painting is a modern-day example of ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'', the alteration of artworks or other objects to remove the image or name of a disfavored person.{{sfn|Unverzagt|p=220}}  Deng Zhangyu, in a 2014 article, called the painting "the most significant historical image of China's founding".&lt;ref name="cd2014"/&gt;  Wu Hung suggested that the alterations to it over the years, while always showing Mao proclaiming the new government, parallel the changes that have come to China's leadership during the years of Communist governance.{{sfn|Wu Hung 2005|p=274}}  Andrews wrote that "its greatest importance to the art world was its elevation as a model of party-approved oil painting".{{sfn|Andrews|pp=77, 80}}  Writer Wu Bing in 2009 called it "a milestone in Chinese oil painting, boldly incorporating national styles".{{sfn|Wu Bing|p=66}}  The painting has never been as highly regarded in the West as in China; according to Andrews, "art history students have been known to roar with laughter when slides of it appear on the screen".{{sfn|Andrews|p=80}}  Art historian [[Michael Sullivan (art historian)|Michael Sullivan]] dismissed it as mere propaganda.{{sfn|Andrews|p=80}}  Today, following a merger of museums, both paintings are in the [[National Museum of China]], on Tiananmen Square.&lt;ref name="cn3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="china museum 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern China|url=http://en.chnmuseum.cn/tabid/545/Default.aspx|publisher=[[National Museum of China]]|accessdate=January 22, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828024211/http://en.chnmuseum.cn/tabid/545/Default.aspx|archivedate=August 28, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Mentor Philosophers''''' was a series of six books each covering a period of philosophical thought, published by the [[New American Library]].   Each book was edited by an esteemed contemporary philosophy academic and contained analysis of a group of philosophers from a chosen period.

The series was very influential during the 1950s and 1960s and went a number of editions in paperback.  Literary historian [[Gilbert Highet]] called it a "very important and interesting series".

'''''The Ricotta Eaters''''' is a c.1580 oil on canvas painting by [[Vincenzo Campi]], showing four figures eating a round [[ricotta]]. The artist himself entitled it ''Buffonaria'', which links its four figures to [[Commedia dell'arte]] characters, with the artist himself shown in the costume of [[Pantalone]]. The work is now in the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]], which was given it by Jacques Bernard in 1875.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6050">[[Image:IolantheWilhelm.jpg|right|thumb|Wilhelm's 1882 design for the title role in ''[[Iolanthe]]'']]
'''William John Charles Pitcher''' (21 March 1858 – 2 March 1925), known as '''Wilhelm''' or '''C. Wilhelm''', was an [[English people|English]] artist, costume and scenery designer, best known for his designs for ballets, [[pantomime]]s, [[comic operas]], and [[Edwardian musical comedies]].

==Life and career==
Wilhelm was born at [[Northfleet]], in [[Kent]], England, the son of a shipbuilder.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Mr. Pitcher's Art" - Obituary ''[[The Times]]'', 3 March 1925&lt;/ref&gt;  

The young artist showed early promise, and [[J. R. Planché]] recommended him to design for the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]].  There, Wilhelm created costumes, beginning in 1877, for numerous works, including the famous pantomimes of Sir [[Augustus Harris]] and for others until 1897, including the spectacular drama, ''Armada'' (1888).&lt;ref name=Times1920&gt;"Famous Ballet Designer - Identity of 'C. Wilhelm' Revealed", ''[[The Times]]'', 1 June 1920, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  He also designed costumes for various [[music hall]] artists and for many London theatres, including [[Her Majesty's Theatre]], The Coliseum, [[The Crystal Palace]], and for three pantomimes at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]].  For [[Robert Courtneidge]] in [[Manchester, England]], Wilhelm designed two [[Shakespeare]] plays: ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and ''[[As You Like It]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art.com/asp/display_artist-asp/_/crid--45777/C_Wilhelm.htm Images of Wilhelm's Shakespeare designs]&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilhelm also designed costumes for numerous pantomimes, including ''Cinderella'', ''[[Richard Whittington#Dick Wittington - Pantomime character|Dick Whittington]]'', and ''Blue Beard''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its-behind-you.com/wilhelm.html Information about, and drawings of, numerous Wilhelm designs]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the designer for some of the costumes in several of the original [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in the 1880s, including ''[[Iolanthe]]'', ''[[Princess Ida]]'', ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' (revival), ''[[The Mikado]]'', and ''[[Ruddigore]]''.  He also designed costumes for ''[[Jane Annie]]'' at the Savoy (1893) and for the [[Olympia, London]] spectacles ''Nero'' (1889) and ''Venice'' (1891).&lt;ref name=Times1920/&gt;

[[Image:Rosalind-and-the-Old-Duke-As-You-Like-It.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A design for ''[[As You Like It]]'']]
Wilhelm was, perhaps, best known for his work for the [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire Theatre]], London, from 1887 to 1915, where he designed both scenery and costumes for (and sometimes produced) numerous ballets, many of which starred [[Adeline Genée]], and which established a fashion for stage design and were much imitated.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;  His later costume designs included ''[[The New Aladdin]]'' (1906); [[Edward German]]'s opera ''[[Tom Jones (Edward German)|Tom Jones]]'' (1907); ''Peter Pan'' (the famous mermaid costumes for the 1905 revival); and ''[[The Arcadians (musical)|The Arcadians]]'' (1909) and ''The Mousmé'' (1911), among other musical comedies.  Wilhelm's costume designs were seen on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in ''[[Ruddigore]]'' (1887), ''[[A Runaway Girl]]'' (1898–99), ''[[The Toreador]]'' (1902), ''[[Three Little Maids]]'' (1903), ''The Babes and the Baron'' (1905–06), ''[[The Red Mill]]'' (1906–07), ''The Soul Kiss'' (1908), ''The Silver Star'' (1909–10), ''The Old Town'' (1910), ''The Arcadians''  (1910), ''[[The Girl in the Train]]'' (1910), ''The Lady of the Slipper''  (1912–13), ''Chin Chin'' (1914–15), ''The Yankee Princess'' (1922), ''Stepping Stones'' (scenic and costume design, 1923–24), ''[[Madame Pompadour]]'' (1924–25).&lt;ref&gt;{{IBDB name|name=Information about Wilhelm designs for Broadway productions|id=25432}} accessed 5 Jan 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

London's ''[[The Times]]'' wrote, "Wilhelm excelled especially in rendering the spirit and detail of historical periods, but he had also an amusing skill in turning modern costumes to his fantastic purposes.... to his imaginative gifts he added remarkable precision and firmness in execution and great ingenuity in the treatment of colour."&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;  Wilhelm also contributed a number of articles on the art of the theatre to ''The Magazine of Art'', including "Art in Ballet" (1895).  In his last years, he focused on watercolour painting, especially of flowers and plant life, and illustrating children's books, including ''The Child of the Air'', and he was elected to the [[Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours]] in 1920.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

He died in London just short of his 67th birthday&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; and is buried in [[Brompton cemetery]].
