'''Abraham Joseph Berline''' (6 October 1893 &amp;ndash; 1942) was a [[Russia]]n artist who lived in [[Paris]] and died during [[World War II]].

Abraham Joseph Berline was born on October 6, 1893, in [[Nizhyn]], [[Russian Empire]] (currently in [[Ukraine]]). He was the son of Leib Berline and Hana Kaganoff. In 1912, at the age of 19, he emigrated to Paris to study at the [[Ecole des Beaux Arts]]. He supported himself by driving a taxi and every place he saw figured in his landscapes. His work was highly regarded and exhibited at the most prestigious Parisian salons: [[Salon d'Automne]], [[Salon des Indépendants]], [[Salon des Tuileries]], the [[Paul Appel Gallery]], and in private galleries.

When [[France]] was invaded, Berline joined the [[Resistance during World War II|Resistance]], but in May 1941 Berline was arrested in the Billet Vert operation and interned as a Russian Jew in [[Compiègne]] camp. He continued to produce work, mainly pastels, focusing on the beauty of nature, in an attempt to transcend the camp experience through art. These paintings were shown in the camp along with other artists' work. After seven months he was transferred to [[Drancy internment camp]], and from there to [[Auschwitz]], as was his wife Doucia—never to return. His works are included in the art collection of the  [[Ghetto Fighters' House|Ghetto Fighters' House Museum]] and the [[Musée d'Histoire Contemporaine]] in Paris.

An '''''aka-e''''' ({{lang|ja|赤絵}} "red picture") is a type of [[ukiyo-e]] that is printed entirely or predominantly in red.  Aka-e were said to be talismans against [[smallpox]], especially when they bore images of [[Zhong Kui|Shōki the demon queller]].  A woodblock print having a significant portion of the design entirely in red may also be considered to be an aka-e.

[[Image:Baptistery.Arians02.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|The Arian baptistry]]
The '''Arian Baptistry''' in [[Ravenna]], Italy is a Christian baptismal building that was erected by the [[Ostrogothic]] King [[Theodoric the Great]] between the end of the 5th century and the beginning of the 6th century A.D., at the same time as the [[Basilica of Sant' Apollinare Nuovo]].

Theodoric was an [[Arian Christianity|Arian Christian]] and decided to let the Goths ([[Arian]]s) and the Orthodox [[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian Christians]] live together but separately, and so there were separate neighborhoods and separate religious buildings. 
 
Near his palace, the king commissioned an Arian cathedral, now called the '''Church of Spirito Santo''', but originally named ''Hagia Anastasis'' (Holy Resurrection). It was re-consecrated as the Chalcedonian cathedral of [[Theodore of Amasea|Saint Teodoro]] (soldier and martyr of [[Amasya|Amasea in Pontus]]) in 526 AD. Little remains of the original church after its reconstruction in 1543; some historians speculate that the original mosaics were lost over a thousand years earlier during its Catholic reconstruction due to Arian themes.  During this same period, Theodoric also had the baptistry built, today referred to as "of the Arians" in order to distinguish it from the [[Baptistry of Neon]] (of the Orthodox) which is about one century older.

== Shape and structure ==

The Baptistry is octagonal in shape with some little apses and arched openings near the top.  Along the external perimeter there was once a walkway that stopped at the eastern apse.  Clearly, the building was once part of a larger complex.  
Inside are four niches and a dome with [[mosaics]], depicting the [[baptism]] of [[Jesus]] by Saint [[John the Baptist]]. Jesus is shown as a beardless, half-submerged in the Jordan. John the Baptist is wearing a leopard skin. On the left stands a white-haired, old man in a green cloak, holding a leather bag. He is the personification of the river Jordan. Above, the [[Holy Spirit]] in the form of a dove sprays lustral water from its beak.

Below, a procession of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]], led in separate directions by [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] circle the dome, meeting at a throne with a jeweled [[crucifix]] resting on a purple cushion.

It took the artists several years to complete these mosaics, as can be clearly seen from the different colors of the stones used to depict the grass at the feet of the apostles.  The designs are quite simple, but the excessive use of a gold background should be noted, as it was typically used in this era to infuse these simple scenes with an ethereal glow.

== Similarity to Eastern Orthodox architecture ==

The entire composition is remarkably similar to that of the Orthodox [[Baptistry of Neon]]. The walls are bare, but were not always so. During archaeological investigations, some 170 kilograms of tessera were found on the floor.  Due to the lack of Arian references, it is believed that the artists who created the mosaics were Orthodox Christians, as the Ostrogoths were predominantly goldsmiths and not mosaic artists.  

In 565, after the condemnation of the [[Arianism|Arian]] sect, this small octagonal brick structure was converted into a Chalcedonian oratory named Santa Maria. Eastern-Rite monks added a [[monastery]] during the period of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] and further dedicated the structure to Saint Maria in Cosmedin. Around the year 1700, the structure passed into private hands, and in 1914 it was acquired by the Italian government. The Allied bombardment of [[World War II]] helped clear away other structures which had encroached on it from all sides, enabling researchers to view the details of its exterior for the first time.

'''''Blood Cross''''' is one of American photographer [[Andres Serrano]]{{'}}s early religious-themed [[postmodern art|postmodernist]] images, released in 1985, two years before the controversial ''[[Piss Christ]]'' was debuted. This image depicted a [[plexiglass]] cross filled with cow's blood; the cross leaked slightly making it appear as though it was bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = New York Media, LLC| last = LLC| first = New York Media| title = New York Magazine| date = 1995-02-27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOMCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA118}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was exhibited along with ''Milk, Blood'' as part of Serrano's ''Fluids'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Psychology Press| isbn = 978-0-415-30184-8| last = Young| first = Alison| title = Judging the Image: Art, Value, Law| date = 2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WZZaFE7zyRwC&amp;pg=PA29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3224">'''Book swapping''' or '''book exchange''' is the practice of a [[trade|swap]] of [[books]] between one person and another. Practiced among book groups, friends and colleagues at work, it provides an inexpensive way for people to exchange books, find out about new books and obtain a new book to read without having to pay.  Because swaps occur between individuals, without central distribution or warehousing, and without the copyright owner making a profit, the practice has been compared to [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) systems such as [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1022148/bittorrent-arrives-books BitTorrent arrives for books], the INQUIRER&lt;/ref&gt;—except that hard-copy original analog objects are exchanged.

== College book exchange programs ==
Many colleges and universities have developed online book exchange programs to help students save money on [[textbook]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tap.usf.edu/ Textbook Affordability Project (TAP) at USF], TAP USF website&lt;/ref&gt; Some colleges build their own systems and others use systems from third party service providers.

== Informal book exchanges ==
[[File:Street book exchange 181st Street and Fort Washington Ave Hudson Heights.jpg|thumb|A "street book exchange" in [[Washington Heights, New York]].]]

Some book exchanges are informal - a shelf or box is provided where books can be left or picked up. The exchange relies on users leaving and taking books and is generally not supervised.

This is a frequent practice in [[youth hostel]]s where travellers can leave a book and take a different book with them. Some [[railway stations]] in Great Britain have informal book exchanges and one has also been set up in a [[phone box]] in [[Kington Magna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/428572/What-a-novel-idea-villagers-transform-redundant-phone-box-into-a-LIBRARY What a novel idea - villagers transform redundant phone box into a LIBRARY], ''Daily Express''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brisbane Arts Theatre''' refers to both an independent theatre company in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], Australia and the building in which it resides.

__TOC__

== Theatre company history ==
Brisbane Arts Theatre was founded in 1936 as Brisbane Amateur Theatres by Jean Trundle and Vic Hardgraves. The company's name was changed in 1947. Its early seasons up until the early 1960s consisted of five productions, each with three-night seasons in venues such as All Saint's Hall, Princess Theatre, Theatre Royal and Albert Hall. It also presented 12 to 14 performances of an annual junior [[Shakespeare]] play and three one act plays throughout its season at various venues, including the Brisbane branch of the [[Royal Over-Seas League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Arts Theatre (Brisbane, Qld.) | title=[Arts Theatre [Brisbane] : Program File] | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/36727362 | accessdate=2 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fryer Library Theatre Programs – Arts Theatre [1951-] {{cite web|url=http://www.library.uq.edu.au/fryer/theatre_programs/arts_theatre.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903190904/http://www.library.uq.edu.au/fryer/theatre_programs/arts_theatre.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brisbane Arts Theatre's first production in its new venue on Petrie Terrace was ''The Multi-Coloured Umbrella'' by [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]] playwright Barbara Mary Vernon, which opened on 16 September 1961. Its first full season in its new home included nine plays of up to 20 performances each.

During the rebuilding of the venue (see below) between 1964 and 1965, the company persisted with its seasons off site. Following the completion of the rebuilt venue, ten plays per season were performed, each consisting of 19 performances over a five-week duration. In 1965, an annual children's theatre season was added with the first production featuring [[Carol Burns]] as Gretel in ''Hansel and Gretel''.

The company was funded only by box office revenue until government funding began in the form of a small annual [[Government of Queensland|Queensland state government]] grant in 1969, which ceased in the 1990s under the [[Wayne Goss|Goss Labor government]]. It has since again operated solely on performance revenue and College of Theatre Practice tuition fees.

In recent years the theatre's annual seasons have consisted of five to seven productions each from its mainhouse and children's theatre divisions. Its recent high-grossing productions have included the stage debuts of three plays based on novels by [[John Birmingham]], adapted by Simon Bedak: [[He Died with a Felafel in His Hand]], [[The Tasmanian Babes Fiasco]] and How to Be a Man; and productions of [[Avenue Q]] in 2012 and in 2014 and 2015. The company claims to be "Brisbane's home of Avenue Q."

== Venue history ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Brisbane Arts Theatre 210 Petrie Terrace 1960s.jpg| thumb | right | 250px | Brisbane Arts Theatre's venue in the 1960s. The venue's architectural shape served as the inspiration behind the company's new logo in 2014. {{deletable image-caption|Wednesday, 17 August 2016}}]] --&gt;
Brisbane Arts Theatre was the first theatre company in Brisbane to operate its own theatre premises. The venue is located at 210 Petrie Terrace, in the suburb of [[Petrie Terrace, Queensland|Petrie Terrace]]. It seats 151 people in the stalls and gallery combined and features a small courtyard and a bar.

The property, formerly Dan's, a second-hand shop, was purchased in June 1959 for £6,000 and redeveloped as a theatre. Initially reported to seat 220, it opened in September 1961 with a single-level, raked 144-seat auditorium and a 10[[Foot (unit)|ft]]-deep stage. The first floor accommodated the costume department and office. The theatre was officially opened by [[Premier of Queensland]] [[Frank Nicklin]] on 22 September.&lt;ref name="50years"&gt;Brisbane Arts Theatre (1987). ''The First Fifty Years 1936-1986''. {{ISBN|0731610350}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At around 3 am on 31 May 1964, the theatre was heavily damaged by fire, caused by an electrical fault in the toilet block. Upon initial assessment of the damage, the theatre director and insurance representatives agreed that the building could be repaired within a matter of weeks, however, smouldering materials ignited a second blaze at 8.30am, which resulted in extensive damage throughout. £12,000 was loaned by the [[Commonwealth Trading Bank]] for the rebuilding of the theatre based on a new design by the initial architect, John Dalton. It included the addition of a [[Theater (structure)#Seating and audience|dress circle]], increased [[Theater (structure)#Seating and audience|stalls]] capacity, a 25ft deep stage and two dressing rooms under the stage. The theatre reopened on 25 June 1965, the reconstruction totalling £20,000.&lt;ref name="50years" /&gt;

In the late 1960s the adjoining cottage – a deceased estate – was purchased for £6,000 and later, in the early 1970s, the two-storey building at 222 Petrie Terrace was added to the complex. The cottage, at number 206, was renamed after Cor Boogaart, a set constructionist for the theatre for 27 years. The property at number 222 housed the theatre's [[Wardrobe (clothing)|wardrobe department]] and rehearsal space until its sale in 2011. Cor Boogart Cottage, having previously been used as a rehearsal venue, now houses the wardrobe division and a rehearsal space and [[Theatrical scenery|set]] [[Set construction|construction]] workshop downstairs. The two rehearsal venues were renovated between 1976 and 1978 at the same time as the construction of the theatre's current [[office]] and bar. The Cor Boogaart Cottage was again refurbished following the sale of 222 in May 2011.&lt;ref name="50years" /&gt;

Brisbane Arts Theatre also runs the College of Theatre Practice, offering certificates in Performing Arts and in Live Production and Technical Services.

==Alumni==
A number of notable Australian actors have performed at Brisbane Arts Theatre, including [[Carol Burns]], [[Michael Caton]], [[Barry Otto]], [[Judith McGrath]], [[Bunny Brooke]], [[Jennifer Flowers]], [[John Stanton (actor)|John Stanton]], Penny Downie, and Kate Wilson.
Other notable performers include actor and director Ian Thomson, the late Wayne Goss, who would later become Premier of Queensland (ironically his government would cut an annual grant to the company), and Roslyn Atkinson, who would be the judge in the trial of [[Daniel Morcombe]]'s killer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2356">'''Cyberarts''' or '''cyberart''' refers to the class of art produced with the help of [[computer software]] and [[computer hardware|hardware]], often with an interactive or [[multimedia]] aspect. 

==Overview==
The term "cyberarts" is vague and relatively [[neologism|new]]; nevertheless much of the work described by this term is rarely described any other way. For instance, a common type of cyberart which is produced programmatically by applying a set of design rules to a natural or preexisting process. A program could produce a few million such 'works of art' in a minute.

The word "CyberArts" is claimed as a registered trademark by [[Miller Freeman Inc.]], promoter of a series of muti-media technology conferences known as [[CyberArts International]] during the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Jacobson (ed.), ''CyberArts: Exploring Art and Technology.'' San Francisco, CA: Miller Freeman Inc., 1992; pg. ii.&lt;/ref&gt;

″Recent works of bioart propose to connect the viewer, transformed into a user, with different biological organisms by pirating their biometric data using digital interfaces. These immersive aesthetic propositions are based on a plural conception of the human body, forged in the crucible of cybernetics. Their new modes of communication explore the alternative path of an ecological continuum where the user enters a becoming-cyborg, far from the classic representations of human-machine coupling. They encourage us to reconsider the notion of bioart, in favor of ''cyberart''.″&lt;ref&gt; Teva Flaman &amp; Pierre-Luc Verville. ″Cyberart : du mode d’existence d’un devenir-cyborg.″ Inter, numéro 128, hiver 2018, p. 42–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Diana and Actaeon''''' is a painting by the [[Italian Renaissance]] master [[Titian]], finished in 1556–1559, and is considered amongst Titian's greatest works. It portrays the moment in which the hunter [[Actaeon]] bursts in where the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and her nymphs are bathing. Diana is furious, and will turn Actaeon into a stag, who is then pursued and killed by his own hounds, a scene Titian later painted in his ''[[The Death of Actaeon]]'' ([[National Gallery]]).  

Diana is the woman on the right side of the painting. She is wearing a crown with a crescent moon on it and is being covered by the dark skinned woman who may be her servant.  The nymphs display a variety of reactions, and a variety of nude poses.

In 2008–2009, the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery, London]] and [[National Gallery of Scotland]] successfully campaigned to acquire the painting from the [[Orleans Collection|Bridgewater Collection]] for £50&amp;nbsp;million.  As a result, ''Diana and Actaeon'' will remain on display in the UK, and will alternate between the two galleries on five-year terms.

==To 2005==
''Diana and Actaeon'' is part of a series of seven famous canvases, the "poesies", depicting mythological scenes from [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' painted for [[Philip II of Spain]] (after [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]] had declined Titian's offer to paint them for him).&lt;ref&gt;Brigstocke, 180 and 183-4&lt;/ref&gt; The work remained in the Spanish royal collection until 1704, when King [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] gave it to the French ambassador. It was soon acquired by [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]], nephew of [[Louis XIV]], and Regent of France during the minority of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], for his [[Orleans Collection|collection]], one of the finest ever assembled. After the [[French Revolution]], the [[Orleans collection]] was sold to a [[Brussels]] dealer by [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]] in 1791, two years before he was guillotined.&lt;ref&gt;Brigstocke, 11&lt;/ref&gt; This dealer then exhibited many pictures from the collection (including the Titians) in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/30/art.celebrity.money|title=The industrial revolution brought Titians and Renoirs to Scotland|first=Ian|last=Jack|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=30 August 2008|accessdate=2008-08-30 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The largest share of the collection was thus bought in 1798 by the coal-magnate [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater]], including this painting, Titian's ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'' (from the same mythological series of seven paintings), eight paintings by [[Poussin]], three [[Raphael]]s and [[Rembrandt]]'s ''Self-Portrait, aged 51''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgalleries.org/index.php/collection/online_az/4:322/results/0/8677/|title=Rembrandt, "Self-Portrait, aged 51" – NGS catalogue entry|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219003336/http://www.nationalgalleries.org/index.php/collection/online_az/4%3A322/results/0/8677/|archivedate=2012-02-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third Duke of Bridgewater was probably inspired to buy the paintings by his nephew, [[George Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland|Earl Gower]], the ancestor of the Dukes of Sutherland. Certainly, on Bridgewater's death five years after the purchase, he bequeathed the Titians and the rest of the collection to Gower, who put it on display to the public in his [[Bridgewater House, Westminster|London house]] – it has been on public display ever since. On first seeing the collection there, [[William Hazlitt]] wrote "I was staggered when I saw the works&amp;nbsp;... A new sense came upon me, a new heaven and a new Earth stood before me.". On the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in September 1939, the collection was moved from London to [[Scotland]]. Between 1945–2009, the ''Diana and Actaeon'' and ''Diana and Callisto'' (with other paintings from the collection, known collectively as "the Bridgewater loan" or "the Sutherland Loan"&lt;ref&gt;The loan includes a total of 26 paintings, sixteen from the Orléans Collection. – Brigstocke, 11&lt;/ref&gt;) were on long-term display at the National Gallery of Scotland, in Edinburgh.

The Sutherland collection has passed by descent to the [[Francis Egerton, 7th Duke of Sutherland|7th Duke of Sutherland]], (most of whose wealth is contained in the paintings collection), but in late August 2008 the 7th Duke announced that he wished to sell some of the collection in order to diversify his assets.&lt;ref&gt;He had previously sold another Titian from the loan — the ''[[Venus Anadyomene (Titian)|Venus Anadyomene]]'' — to the NGS in 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; He had offered them as a pair to the British national galleries at £100&amp;nbsp;million (a third of their overall estimated market price) if they could demonstrate, by the end of 2008, the ability to raise that sum — if not, the pair or other paintings from the Bridgewater collection would be put on public [[auction]] early in 2009. Within days of the Duke's decision, the NGS and the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]], London had announced they would combine forces to raise the sum, initially in the form of £50&amp;nbsp;million (or a demonstration that this money could be raised) to purchase ''Diana and Actaeon'' and paid over three years in instalments and then £50&amp;nbsp;million for ''Diana and Callisto'' paid for similarly from 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Bates|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/28/art|title=Art auction: National galleries scramble to keep Titians as duke cashes in|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 August 2008|accessdate=2008-08-28 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/28/art|title=Editorial: In praise of... the Bridgewater loan|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 August 2008|accessdate=2008-08-28 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgalleries.org/aboutus/news/1:171/5879|title=National Galleries of Scotland press release|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219003215/http://www.nationalgalleries.org/aboutus/news/1%3A171/5879|archivedate=2012-02-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dichromacy''' (''di''  meaning "two" and ''chroma'' meaning "color") is the state of having two types of functioning [[color]] receptors, called [[cone cell]]s, in the [[eye]]s. Organisms with dichromacy are called dichromats. Dichromats can match any color they see with a mixture of no more than two pure [[spectrum|spectral lights]]. By comparison, [[trichromat]]s require three pure spectral lights to match all colors that they can perceive, and [[Tetrachromacy|tetrachromats]] require four.

Dichromacy in humans is a color vision defect in which one of the three basic color mechanisms is absent or not functioning. It is hereditary and sex-linked, predominantly affecting males.&lt;ref name="Cassin"&gt;Cassin, B. and Solomon, S. ''Dictionary of Eye Terminology''. Gainesville, Florida: Triad Publishing Company, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Dichromacy occurs when one of the cone pigments is missing and color is reduced to two dimensions.&lt;ref name="Tiresias"&gt;[http://www.tiresias.org/guidelines/colour_blindness.htm "Guidelines: Colour Blindness."] Tiresias.org. Retrieved 29 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
There are various kinds of [[color blindness]]:

* [[Protanopia]] is a severe form of red-green color blindness, in which there is impairment in perception of very long wavelengths, such as reds.  To these individuals, reds are perceived as beige or grey and greens tend to look beige or grey like reds. It is also the most common type of dichromacy today. This problem occurs because patients do not have the red cone cells in the retina.&lt;ref name="HanggiIngersoll2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanggi|first1=Evelyn B.|last2=Ingersoll|first2=Jerry F.|last3=Waggoner|first3=Terrace L.|title=Color vision in horses (Equus caballus): Deficiencies identified using a pseudoisochromatic plate test.|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|volume=121|issue=1|year=2007|pages=65–72|issn=1939-2087|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.121.1.65}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Protanomaly]] is a less severe version.
* [[Deuteranopia]] consists of an impairment in perceiving medium wavelengths, such as greens.  [[Deuteranomaly]] is a less severe form of deuteranopia.  Those with deuteranomaly cannot see reds and greens like those without this condition; however, they can still distinguish them in most cases. It is very similar to protanopia. In this form, patients do not have green cone cells in the retina, which makes it hard to see the green color.&lt;ref name="HanggiIngersoll2007" /&gt;
* A rarer form of color blindness is [[tritanopia]], where there exists an inability to perceive short wavelengths, such as blues.  Sufferers have trouble distinguishing between yellow and blue. They tend to confuse greens and blues, and yellow can appear pink. This is the rarest of all dichromacy, and occurs in around 1 in 100,000 people. Patients do not have the blue cone cells in the retina.

==Testing for dichromacy==
The three determining elements of a dichromatic opponent-colour space are the missing colour, the null-luminance plane, and the null-chrominance plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scheibner | first1 = H. | last2 = Cleveland | first2 = S. | year = 1998 | title = Dichromacy characterized by chrominance planes | url = | journal = Vision Research | volume = 38 | issue = 21| pages = 3403–3407 | doi=10.1016/s0042-6989(97)00373-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The description of the phenomena itself does not indicate the colour that is impaired to the dichromat, however, it does provides enough information to identify the fundamental colour space, the colours that are seen by the dichromat. This is based on testing both the null-chrominance plane and null-luminance plane which intersect on the missing colour. The cones excited to a corresponding colour in the colour space are visible to the dichromat and those that are not excited are the missing colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scheibner | first1 = H. | last2 = Cleveland | first2 = S. | year = 1997 | title = Dichromacy characterized by chrominance planes | url = | journal = Vision Research | volume = 38 | issue = 1| pages = 3403–3407 | doi=10.1016/s0042-6989(97)00373-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals that are dichromats==
It is more informative to use situations where less than the total visual system is operating when studying about vision. For example, a system by which cones are the sole visual receptors could be used. This is rare in humans but certain animals possess this trait and this proves useful in understanding the concept of dichromacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobs | first1 = G.

The exceptions to dichromatic vision in placental mammals are [[Catarrhini|primates closely related to humans]], which are usually trichromats, and sea mammals (both [[pinniped]]s and [[cetacea]]ns) which are cone [[monochromacy|monochromat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vorobyev|first=M|title=Ecology and evolution of primate colour vision|journal=Clinical &amp; Experimental Optometry|date=Jul 2004|volume=87|issue=4–5|pages=230–8|pmid=15312027|url=http://www.csh.rit.edu/~oguns/school/psychology/Articles/EcologyEvolutionPrimateColorVision.pdf|accessdate=7 January 2013|doi=10.1111/j.1444-0938.2004.tb05053.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New World Monkeys]] are a partial exception: in most species, males are dichromats, and about 60% of females are trichromats, but the [[owl monkey]]s are cone [[monochromacy|monochromats]], and both sexes of [[howler monkey]]s are trichromats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobs | first1 = G.

==Color detecting abilities of dichromats==

According to colour vision researchers at the [[Medical College of Wisconsin]] (including [[Jay Neitz]]), each of the three standard colour-detecting cones in the retina of [[trichromat]]s – [[blue]], [[green]] and [[red]] – can pick up about 100 different gradations of colour. If each detector is independent of the others, simple [[exponentiation]] gives a total number of colours discernible by an average human as their product, or about 1 million;&lt;ref name="Roth 2006" &gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06256/721190-114.stm
  |title=Some women who are tetrachromats may see 100,000,000 colors, thanks to their genes
  |author=Mark Roth
  |publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
  |date= 13 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless, other researchers have put the number at upwards of 2.3 million.&lt;ref name=Jacobs09/&gt; Exponentiation suggests that a dichromat (such as a human with red-green [[color blindness]]) would be able to distinguish about 10,000 different colours,&lt;ref&gt;"Color Vision:Almost Reason for Having Eyes" by Jay Neitz, Joseph Carroll, and Maureen Neitz  Optics &amp; Photonics News January 2001 1047-6938/01/01/0026/8- Optical Society of America&lt;/ref&gt; but no such calculation has been verified by [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] testing.

Furthermore, dichromats have a significantly higher threshold than trichromats for coloured stimuli flickering at low (1&amp;nbsp;Hz) frequencies. At higher (10 or 16&amp;nbsp;Hz) frequencies, dichromats perform as well as or better than trichromats.&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe Lindsay T. ; de Luca Emanuela ; Hansen Thorsten; Gegenfurtner Karl R. "Advantages and disadvantages of human dichromacy" ''JOURNAL OF VISION'',  Volume: 6   Issue: 3   Pages: 213–223   {{doi|10.1167/6.3.3}}  Published: 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bayer Florian S.; Vivian Paulun C.; Weiss David; Gegenfurtner Karl R. "A tetrachromatic display for the spatiotemporal control of rod and cone stimulation" ''JOURNAL OF VISION'',  Volume: 15   Issue: 11   {{doi|10.1167/15.11.15}}  Published: 2015&lt;/ref&gt; This means such animals would still observe the flicker instead of a temporally fused visual percept as is the case in human movie watching at a high enough [[frame rate]].

The '''Drama Association of Wales''' was founded in 1934, a registered charity since 1973 and was core funded by the [[Arts Council of Wales]] from 1974 to 2011. The function of DAW is to increase opportunities for people in the community to be creatively involved in drama. This is supported through the provision of training, new writing initiatives and access to an extensive lending library containing plays, play-sets and technical theatre books.

In April 1991, DAW acquired the [[United Kingdom|British]] Theatre Association playsets, making the association the world’s largest specialist [[English language]] lending library.

DAW plays an active role as part of the [[National Festival of Community Theatre]], with seven regional festivals held throughout Wales between March and May.

In Spring of 2011 funding from the Arts Council of Wales ceased and the library was moved to the [[Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama]]. §&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dramawales.org.uk/pages/aboutus/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1927">In [[theoretical physics]], '''explicit symmetry breaking''' is the breaking of a [[symmetry]] of a [[theory]] by terms in its defining [[equation of motion|equations of motion]] (most typically, to the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] or the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]]) that do not respect the symmetry. Usually this term is used in situations where these symmetry-breaking terms are small, so that the symmetry is approximately respected by the theory. An example is the spectral line splitting in the [[Zeeman effect]], due to a magnetic interaction perturbation in the Hamiltonian of the atoms involved.

Explicit symmetry breaking differs from [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]]. In the latter, the defining equations respect the symmetry but the [[ground state]] ([[vacuum state|vacuum]]) of the theory breaks it.&lt;ref&gt;Castellani, E. (2003) "On the meaning of Symmetry Breaking" in Brading, K. and Castellani, E. (eds)  Symmetries in Physics: New Reflections, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Explicit symmetry breaking is also associated with electromagnetic radiation. A system of accelerated charges results in electromagnetic radiation when the geometric symmetry of the electric field in free space is explicitly broken by the associated electrodynamic structure under time varying excitation of the given system. This is quite evident in an antenna where the electric lines of field curl around or have rotational geometry around the radiating terminals in contrast to linear geometric orientation within a pair of transmission lines which does not radiate even under time varying excitation.&lt;ref&gt;Sinha &amp; Amaratunga (2016) "Explicit Symmetry Breaking in Electrodynamic Systems and Electromagnetic Radiation" Morgan Claypool, Institute of Physics, UK&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|a literary form|the real estate concept|Fixer-upper|"fixup" in the context of executable formats on computers|Relocation (computer science)}}

A '''fix-up''' (or '''fixup''') is a [[novel]] created from several [[short fiction]] stories that may or may not have been initially related or previously published. The stories may be edited for consistency, and sometimes new connecting material, such as a [[frame story]] or other interstitial narration, is written for the new work. The term was coined by the [[science fiction]] writer [[A. E. van Vogt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weinberg|first1=Robert|title=A. E. van Vogt: The Weinberg Interview (1980)|url=http://www.icshi.net/sevagram/interviews/weinberg.php|website=Icshi.net|publisher=Isaac Walwyn|accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; who published several fix-ups of his own, including ''[[The Voyage of the Space Beagle]]'',&lt;ref name="liptak20130805"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Liptak |first=Andrew |date=2013-08-05 |title=A.E. van Vogt and the Fix-Up Novel |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/e-van-vogt-and-fix-novel/ |magazine=Kirkus Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the practice (if not the term) exists outside of science fiction. The use of the term in science fiction criticism was popularised by the first (1979) edition of the ''[[Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'', edited by [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]], which credited Van Vogt with the creation of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nicholls | first = Peter |author2=John Clute| title = New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction | publisher = Orbit | location = London | year = 1999 | isbn = 1-85723-897-4 | page = 432}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/fixup|title=Fixup page at Encyclopedia of Science Fiction (Third Edition)|website=Encyclopedia of Science Fiction}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The name comes from the modifications that the author needs to make in the original texts to make them fit together as though they were a novel. Foreshadowing of events from the later stories may be jammed into an early chapter of the fix-up, and character development may be interleaved throughout the book. Contradictions and inconsistencies between episodes are usually worked out.

Some fix-ups in their final form are more of a [[short story cycle]] or composite novel rather than a traditional novel with a single main plotline. Examples are [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[The Martian Chronicles]]'' and [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[I, Robot]]'', both of which read as a series of short stories which may share plot threads and characters but which still act as self-contained stories.&lt;ref name="luscher"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5WyidbsLaxQC&amp;lpg=PA370&amp;ots=mnc_goAXNW&amp;pg=PA370#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |title=A Companion to the American Novel |last=Luscher |first=Robert M. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2012 |isbn=9781405101196 |editor-last=Bendixen |editor-first=Alfred |editor-link=Alfred Bendixen |series=Blackwell Companions to Literature and Culture |volume=80 |page=370 |chapter=The American Short-Story Cycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, van Vogt's ''[[The Weapon Shops of Isher]]'' is structured like a continuous novel although it incorporates material from three previous Van Vogt short stories.

Fix-ups became an accepted practice in the 1950s, when science fiction and [[fantasy]]—once published only in magazines—began appearing in book form. Large book publishers like [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] entered the market, greatly increasing demand for fiction. Authors created new manuscripts from old stories to sell to publishers. [[Algis Budrys]] in 1965 described fixups as a consequence of the lack of good supply during the "bad years for quality" of the mid-1950s, although citing ''The Martian Chronicles'' and [[Clifford D. Simak]]'s ''[[City (novel)|City]]'' as among exceptions.&lt;ref name="budrys196510"&gt;{{Cite magazine

The '''Friends of the Uffizi Gallery''' was established in 2006 in [[Palm Beach, Florida]] as the United States "sister" organization to the Amici degli Uffizi in [[Florence, Italy]], which was founded by a group of concerned citizens in response to the terrorist bombing of the [[Uffizi Gallery]] in May 1993 that damaged several artworks and portions of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cowell|first=Alan|title=Bomb Outside Uffizi in Florence Kills 6 and Damages Many Works|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/28/world/bomb-outside-uffizi-in-florence-kills-6-and-damages-many-works.html|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 28, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Friends of the Uffizi Gallery and the Amici degli Uffizi directly support the Uffizi Gallery by helping build awareness of the museum and its [[cultural heritage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Cultural Heritage|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/illicit-trafficking-of-cultural-property/unesco-database-of-national-cultural-heritage-laws/frequently-asked-questions/definition-of-the-cultural-heritage/|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and by raising funds for acquisitions, preservation, restorations, temporary exhibitions, and educational programming.

== History ==
[[File:Uffizi Gallery from south 2013 February.jpg|thumb|250px|Uffizi Gallery viewed from the south]]

In 1993 a terrorist bomb severely damaged the [[Uffizi Gallery]] and some of the artworks.&lt;ref name=Olive&gt;{{cite news|last=Pirro|first=Deirdre|title=The Olive Tree of Peace: The massacre in via dei Georgofili|url=http://www.theflorentine.net/articles/article-view.asp?issuetocId=7762|accessdate=25 April 2014|newspaper=The Florentine|date=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to this attack, a group of concerned citizens founded the Amici degli Uffizi in Florence to help restore and preserve the artistic heritage of the museum. Since the bombing, the Amici degli Uffizi has supported the Uffizi Gallery by facilitating acquisitions, supporting restorations, and organizing special temporary exhibitions.

In 2006, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery, Inc. was established in Palm Beach, Florida as the United States “sister” organization to the Amici degli Uffizi. Granted 501(c)(3) Tax Exempt Status, its sole purpose is to support the activities of the Amici by helping to fund ongoing restoration projects and to bring these projects to fruition.

Led by Executive Board President Contessa Maria Vittoria Colonna Rimbotti, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery in conjunction with the Amici degli Uffizi raises funds to support all of these activities through an international group of members and patrons. More than 30 restoration projects designated as priorities by the museum have been completed over the last several years and include renowned paintings, altarpieces, sculptures and tapestries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Completed Restoration Projects|url=http://www.friendsoftheuffizigallery.org/completed-restoration-projects/|publisher=Friends of the Uffizi Gallery|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
The mission of both organizations is to support the Uffizi Gallery of Florence, Italy, by raising awareness of the museum and its collections and by providing resources for acquisition, preservation, restoration and education.

=== Friends of the Uffizi Gallery Symbol ===
Created by Sergio Bianco, the symbol represents the view of the Uffizi from the Arno arcade. The sky seen under the archway forms the shape of a horse head in the typical posture of the knight chess piece. Representing loyalty and the right cause, the horse symbolizes the commitment of the Associations Amici degli Uffizi and Friends of the Uffizi Gallery to the benefit of the Uffizi Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Friends of the Uffizi Gallery Symbol|url=http://www.sergiobianco.it/basement.asp?sn=&amp;sez=1&amp;sez1=1&amp;area=&amp;lang=en&amp;nome=&amp;lay=articolo&amp;pag=69|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities and special events ==

===Florentine weekend, Florence Italy===
Every two years, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery organize the Florentine Weekend, which includes art-focused activities at the Uffizi Gallery and in nearby locations throughout the City of Florence that relate to both Renaissance art and Italian culture. It is a members-only event open to Friends of the Uffizi Gallery members at the Botticelli, Michelangelo and Leonardo membership levels.

== Completed restoration projects ==
[[File:Michelangelo- Tondo Doni - tone corrected.jpg|thumb|Michelangelo's ''Tondo Doni'' is the centerpiece of the new room reconstructed through funds from the Friends of Uffizi Gallery]]
More than thirty restorations designated as a priority by the Uffizi Gallery have been completed with funds raised by both Friends of the Uffizi Gallery and Amici degli Uffizi.

The '''Michelangelo Room''', which opened to the public on January 29, 2013, is an example of a completed project by this organization.  The Friends of the Uffizi Gallery and the Amici degli Uffizi funded the re-construction of this room on the second floor and the re-installation of the paintings. The re-construction involved restoring the original marble floor and re-plastering the walls and painting them red. 
The re-installation included Michelangelo’s ''[[Doni Tondo|Tondo Doni]]'' (ca. 1507 oil and tempera on panel) which is the only confirmed panel painting existing today in its original frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Friends of the Uffizi Gallery fund new Michelangelo Room on second floor of gallery in Italy|url=http://artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=2&amp;int_new=60758#.U15_RF7Zdg0|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Art Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Other early sixteenth-century Florentine painters represented in the room include [[Francesco Granacci]], [[Fra Bartolomeo]] (Paolo di Jacopo del Fattorino detto Baccio della Porta), [[Andrea del Sarto]], [[Franciabigio]], [[Giuliano Bugiardini]],  and [[Alonso Berruguete]].

'''''[[Laocoön]]''''' by [[Baccio Bandinelli]] (Firenze 1493-1560), depicts the Trojan priest Laocoön and his two sons ensnared in the toils of the sea serpents sent by [[Poseidon]]. A previous restoration was done when the sculpture was broken into more than 40 pieces by a fire that caused a partial roof collapse at the Uffizi on August 12, 1762. The new restoration improved on the previous one plus removed layers of dust and wax that had built up over the decades and caused the sculpture’s surface to become dull and darkened. This restoration will protect the beauty and condition of this sculpture for many generations.

== Individual restoration projects ==
These two projects are examples of restorations funded by a single Leonardo-level member of the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery.

The restoration of this late 2nd Century A.D. replica of a 5th Century B.C. Greek sculpture of '''''[[Asclepius]]''''', the god of medicine, made it possible to confirm the pertinence of the head to the body. In addition to strengthening the sculpture by replacing old putty, recent cleaning of the surface revealed details from an early 12th Century restoration such as the figure’s left hand holding a medicinal plant well known since the Middle Ages. This restoration was funded by the Lisa Marie Conte Browne Family.

This mid-2nd Century A.D. statue of '''''[[Aphrodite]] &amp; [[Eros]]''''' is a replica of the original Capitoline Venus, apart from the addition of the small funerary Eros. The sculpture’s head, arms and right leg were integrated in 1584. The sculpture is likely to have never been restored since then and the recent restoration included removing the dirt deposits and addressing the ancient integrations and fractures repairs. This restoration was funded by Thomas J. and Judith A. Embrescia.

== Community restoration projects ==
With this type of project, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery accepts donations from all sources (including non-members) interested in conserving a selected work of art.

The 2014 project is a statue of '''''[[Aphrodite]]''''' (2nd Century AD). She is the Greek goddess of love, known as [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] to the Romans. This sculpture is a standing semi-nude female figure created using the ancient Roman fragments of the torso and head. The arms aned richly-draped lower part were added by [[Alessandro Algardi]], an artist hired by the Medici in the 17th Century to integrate the fragments into a single sculpture. This restoration project involved removing thick layers of accumulated dust and greatly increased documentary information.

'''''Gare Montparnasse (The Melancholy of Departure)''''' (Italian: ''La stazione di Montparnasse)'' (1914) is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Metaphysical art|metaphysical painter]] [[Giorgio de Chirico]]. Many of de Chirico’s works were inspired by the introspective feelings evoked by travel. He was born in Greece to Italian parents. This work was painted during a period when he lived in [[Paris]].

The painting depicts the [[Gare Montparnasse]] railway station in [[Paris]], [[France]]. It is a classic example of de Chirico’s style, depicting an angular perspective on an outdoor architectural setting in the long shadows and deep colours of early evening. On the horizon is a steam train with a plume of white smoke billowing away from it. The train image appears several times in de Chirico's work. In the foreground is a bunch of bananas, another recurring image in de Chirico's work (cf. ''[[Le Rêve Transformé]]'').

In 1916, de Chirico painted another work simply titled ''[[The Melancholy of Departure]]''.

'''Gecko''' is an internationally touring physical theatre company, founded in 2001, and led by Artistic Director Amit Lahav.

== Overview ==
The style of the company was influenced primarily by the work of [[Lindsay Kemp]] and David Glass.

With an expanding ensemble of international performers and makers, Gecko creates work through collaboration, experimentation and play, in order to create a universal language through movement and dance.

The style is often referred to as 'Total Theatre', which Lahav describes as utilising any means possible to tell a story, including the creative deployment of puppets, props, physicality, language, music, lighting, multimedia and soundscapes to construct a complete theatrical world from these individual components. Through the ensemble's collaboration and the audience's engagement, each show continually evolves throughout their numerous stages of development.

The company tours nationally and internationally, developing strong partnerships around the world. 

Beyond the stage, Gecko aspires to open the doors on their process via every possible avenue, be it digital, in schools or through one-to-one relationships with their audience.

The '''Glauberg''' is a [[Celts|Celtic]] [[oppidum]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]] consisting of a fortified settlement and several burial mounds, "a princely seat&lt;ref&gt;Prestige goods diagnostic of an elite habitation have not been found; the common designation of the Glauberg as a "princely seat" is based on the contents of the tombs located in a walled sanctuary at the foot of the southern slope.&lt;/ref&gt; of the late [[Hallstatt culture | Hallstatt]] and early [[La Tène]] periods."&lt;ref&gt;R.K., in John T. Koch, ed., ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia'', 2006, ''s.v.'' "Glauberg".&lt;/ref&gt; [[archaeology|Archaeological]] discoveries in the 1990s place the site among the most important early Celtic centres in [[Europe]]. It provides unprecedented evidence on Celtic burial, sculpture and monumental architecture.

==Location and topography==
Geologically, the Glauberg, a ridge (271 m asl) on the east edge of the [[Wetterau]] plain, is a [[basalt]] spur of the [[Vogelsberg Mountains|Vogelsberg]] range. Rising about 150 m above the surrounding areas, it is located between the rivers [[Nidder]] and [[Seeme]] and belongs to the community of [[Glauburg]]. The hilltop forms a nearly horizontal plateau of 800 by 80–200m. Its southwest promontory is known as Enzheimer Köpfchen. To the northwest, the Glauberg slopes steeply down towards the Nidder valley and, in the south, it is connected with undulating uplands. The plateau contained a small perennial pond, which was not fed by springs but simply by surface runoff.&lt;ref&gt;The watertight strata  of clay that contained the pool were broken by demolition after World War II, and the pool drained.

[[File:Gold torque 2.jpg|left|thumb|Gold Celtic [[torc]] found in the larger tumulus at Glauberg, 400&amp;nbsp;BC]]

The presence of ancient ruins on the Glauberg plateau has long been known, though they were credited to the Romans. The discovery of a fragment of an early La Tène [[torc]] in 1906 confirmed the prehistoric nature of the site. Systematic archaeological research began in 1933–1934 with an [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] led by Heinrich Richter (1895–1970) which focused on the fortification.&lt;ref&gt;The findings and documentation were accidentally destroyed in the closing days of World War II (Koch 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies directed by F.-R. Hermann began in 1985 and continued until 1998. It was during this phase that the important burial mound was examined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuerstensitze.de/1156_Projektbeschreibung.html www.fuerstensitze.de :: Landschaftsarchäologie Glauberg :: Projektbeschreibung&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement history of the Glauberg and its area in Celtic times ([[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] and early [[La Tène culture|La Tène]] periods) was the focus of a research project (2004–2006) by the '[[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuerstensitze.de/1120_Fuerstensitz_Glauberg.html www.fuerstensitze.de :: Fürstensitz Glauberg&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Excavations continue into the present day with excavations planned from the 28th May till the 29th June with a multinational team excavating what that is believed to be a former massive rampart that is only visible through lidar at the present moment at the hillfort.

== Summary of settlement history ==
The topographic location marks the Glauberg as a long-term focus of human activity. It combines access to fertile arable land and water with an easily defensible site and a strategic location along several natural traffic routes. Thus, it is not surprising that the hill was the site of human occupation long before and long after its Celtic phase, well into the medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.keltenfuerst.de/index_1.htm ''Besiedelung&lt;/ref&gt;

The Glauberg plateau was first settled in the [[Neolithic]] era (c. 4500 BC) by people of the [[Rössen culture]]. This was followed by a large settlement of the [[Michelsberg culture|Michelsberg]] phase (4000 BC). Michelsberg hilltop fortifications are known elsewhere, so it is possible that the hill was fortified for the first time at that stage. The hill was also settled by the late [[Bronze Age]] [[Urnfield culture]] (1,000–800 BC). During the [[Celts|Celtic]] late [[Hallstatt]]/early [[La Tène]] period, the Glauberg became a centre of supra-regional importance. At this time, it was the seat of an early Celtic prince. Extensive fortifications were erected.

During the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] occupation of Germany, the Glauberg remained unoccupied, probably due to its proximity (5&amp;nbsp;km) to the fortified [[Limes Germanicus]] border. In the 4th and 5th centuries AD, it was reoccupied and became a regional centre once again, as the seat of a local king of the [[Alamanni]]. From the 7th to the 9th century, it was the site of a large [[Franks|Frankish]] fortification. Its importance grew throughout this time, and the fortifications were renewed and extended considerably.

In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Glauberg was incorporated into the [[Staufer]] system of castles, perhaps in an attempt to foster the growth of an urban centre. The fortifications were renovated again, and a tower-like castle was erected on the edge of the plateau; its arched [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] doorway survives. The whole plateau was settled at this time, [[medieval]] foundations of walls, wells and basements survive especially at its north edge. The destruction of that castle, and with it the end of human occupation on the hill, probably occurred in 1256.

==Celtic fortification (oppidum)==
[[Image:Glauberg plan.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Schematic plan of Glauberg oppidum, burial mounds and ditch systems (banks/walls: brown, ditches: yellow).]]
The earliest known fortifications might be pre-Celtic, but they reached a high point in terms of size and elaboration around the 6th or 5th century BC. They remained in use until the 2nd or 1st century BC. Their extent and dimensions mark the Glauberg as one of a network of fortified sites (or ''[[oppidum|oppida]]'') that covered most of south and west central Germany.

The northeast edge of the hill, where the slope is least severe, was disconnected from the adjacent ground by the erection of a massive ditch and bank, perhaps originally forming a [[promontory fort]]. The southern and northern edges were also fortified with walls. The walling techniques included drystone walling, the ''[[murus gallicus]]'' (a typical Celtic technique of wood and stone) and perhaps also mudbrick.

The small hilltop pond would not have sufficed to ensure water supply for the population of so large a settlement. For this reason, an annex was added to the north, with two walls running downslope, enclosing an additional triangular area of 300 x 300 m, including a spring. The point of that annex contained a huge water reservoir, measuring 150 by 60 m. At this time, the fortification was 650 m long, nearly 500 m wide, and enclosed an area of 8.5 ha.

At least two gates, a main one to the northeast and a smaller one to the south, gave access to the interior. They are fairly complex in shape, designed to make access for a possible attacker more difficult. An outer fortification was placed beyond the northeast edge of the ''oppidum''. Walls or banks to the south probably played no defensive role.&lt;ref&gt;For whole section on fortifications: F.-R. Herrmann 1990: Ringwall Glauberg; in: F.-R. Herrmann and A. Jockenhövel (eds.): ''Die Vorgeschichte Hessens'', Stuutgart: Theiss, p. 385-387&lt;/ref&gt;

Such settlements probably housed populations numbering in the thousands. For this reason, combined with their centralising economic role, Celtic oppida are sometime described as proto-urban. Nonetheless, little is known about settlement and other activity on the interior of the site. Evidence from the sites at [[Oppidum of Manching|Manching]] or [[Oberursel]]-Oberstedten suggests that there was probably a village or town-like settlement with houses, workshops and storage areas.

==Sites associated with the ''oppidum''==
Like other such sites, the Glauberg oppidum is connected with several other contemporary sites/complexes in its immediate vicinity:

==="Princely" burial mounds===
[[Image:Glauberg mound1.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The reconstructed Mound 1]]
During an [[aerial archaeology|exploratory overflight]] in 1988, local amateur historians recognised the traces of a large [[tumulus]] in a field 300 m south of the ''oppidum''. Between 1994 and 1997, the State Archaeological Service of Hesse [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavated]] it.&lt;ref&gt;For whole section, see http://www.keltenfuerst.de/index_1.htm ''Fürstengräber'', also Frey and Herrmann 1998, Herrmann 2002&lt;/ref&gt; 
The mound (mound 1) originally had a diameter of nearly 50 m and a height of 6 m. It was surrounded by a circular ditch 10 m wide. At the time, it must have been a visually extremely striking monument. The tumulus contained three features. An empty pit was placed at the centre, perhaps to mislead potential looters. To the northwest, a wooden chamber of 2 x 1 m contained an [[inhumation]], and to the southeast, a [[cremation]] burial had been placed in some kind of wooden container. Cremations are more commonly associated with the [[Halstatt]] phase, inhumation with the [[La Tène]] one.

The occupants of both graves were warriors, as indicated by their accompanying material: [[sword]]s and weaponry. The chamber with the inhumation was extremely well preserved and had never been looted. For this reason, it was decided to remove the whole chamber ''en bloque'' and excavate it more slowly and carefully in the State Service laboratory at [[Wiesbaden]]. The finds from the main burial chamber, each carefully wrapped in cloth, include a fine gold torc and a bronze tubular jug that had contained [[mead]].

A second tumulus (mound 2), 250 m to the south, was discovered later by [[geophysics|geophysical]] survey. Erosion and ploughing had made it totally invisible. About half the size of mound 1, it also contained a warrior, accompanied by weapons, a decorated [[fibula (brooch)|fibula]] and belt, and a gold ring. 
[[Image:Keltenfürst Glauberg vorne links 1.JPG|thumb|left|The Celtic Prince of Glauberg (ca. 500 BC)]]

The high quality of the tomb furnishings as well as other features associated with them indicate that the graves, and their occupants, were of extremely high status. They are therefore classed as "princely" burials, on a par with other well-known finds, including those at [[Vix Grave|Vix]] ([[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], [[France]]), and [[Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave|Hochdorf]] ([[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]]).

===Earthworks and processional road===
A number of earth features (banks and ditches) are located south of the ''oppidum'', some closely associated with mound 1. They appear to play no defensive role. A small square ditch west of the mound is associated with several other features and a number of large postholes, perhaps suggesting a [[shrine]] or temple. Most strikingly, a processional way 350 m long, 10 m wide and flanked by deep ditches approached the tumulus from the southeast, far beyond the settlement perimeter. This was associated with further banks and ditches extending over an area of nearly 2 by 2&amp;nbsp;km. They also contained at least two burials, as well as the statue described below.

The lack of a defensive function and the focus on the burial mounds have led to the suggestion that the enclosure and road system had a [[ritual]] or [[sacred]] significance. Such a complex is, so far, entirely unparalleled in Celtic Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denkmalpflege-hessen.de/Keltenfurst/keltenfurst.html Keltenfürst&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The ''Keltenfürst'' (Celtic prince) of Glauberg ===
Much international attention was attracted especially by the discovery of an extremely rare find, a life-sized [[sandstone]] [[statue]] or [[stele]], dating from the 5th century BC, which was found just outside the larger tumulus.&lt;ref name="statue" /&gt; The stele, fully preserved except for its feet, depicts an armed male warrior. It measures 186&amp;nbsp;cm in height and weighs 230&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="AID"/&gt;{{rp |68}} It is made from a type of sandstone available within a few kilometres of Glauberg. Much detail is clearly visible: his trousers, [[composite armour]] tunic, wooden shield and a typical La Tène sword hanging from his right side. The moustachioed man wears a torc with three pendants, remarkably similar to the one from the chamber in mound 1, several rings on both arms and one on the right hand. On his head, he wears a hood-like headdress crowned by two protrusions, resembling the shape of a [[mistletoe]] leaf. Such headdresses are also known from a handful of contemporary sculptures. As mistletoe is believed to have held a magical or religious significance to the Celts, it could indicate that the warrior depicted also played the role of a priest.&lt;ref name="statue"&gt;Information on statue: http://www.denkmalpflege-hessen.de/Keltenfurst/keltenfurst.html, Herrmann 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Fragments of three similar statues were also discovered in the area. It is suggested that all four statues once stood in the rectangular enclosure. Perhaps they were associated with an ancestor cult.
 
Parallels to the Glauberg warrior statue exist in the form of [[stele|stelai]] from other La Tène sites, such as the Holzgerlingen figure ([[Württemberg State Museum]] in [[Stuttgart]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landesmuseum-stuttgart.de/sammlungen/archaeologie/eisenzeit/stele/ Landesmuseum Württemberg: Stele]. Retrieved 4 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;, a pillar-stele from [[Pfalzfeld]] ([[St Goar]]) ''([[:de:Pfalzfelder Säule|de]])'', today in the [[Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn]], the [[Warrior of Hirschlanden]] and others.

===Postholes===
[[Image:Glaubergkalendarium.JPG|thumb|Reconstructed 16 wooden posts, aside mound 1]]
The purpose of the 16 postholes associated with the mound and enclosure is still undiscovered. First theories had been, that they build an astronomical calendar, to determine seasonal events or holidays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denkmalpflege-hessen.de/Archaeologie/__Kelten_in_Hessen/__kelten_in_hessen.html Kelten in Hessen], State agency for the preservation of cultural heritage. Retrieved 6 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent investigations showed, that they had been built later than the mounds, giving room for interpreting them as part of architectural elements like bridges, arches and temple structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/-01nqmr ''Offenbar doch kein Kalenderbauwerk. Rätselraten um keltische Pfosten auf dem Glauberg'']. [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]. Retrieved 6 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Southern Hesse - a Celtic landscape==
The Glauberg is not isolated within its time and area, although it is the most northeasterly site of its type known at present. But several other important Celtic population centres or ''oppida'' are known from the [[Rhein-Main Region]] and Central Hesse. Two important fortifications, those at Dünsberg near [[Giessen]] and [[Heidetrank Oppidum|Heidetränk Oppidum]] (one of the largest urban settlements in Celtic Europe) near [[Altkönig]] in the [[Taunus|Taunus mountains]] are visible from Glauberg.  Nearby is also the Celtic salt industry at [[Bad Nauheim]].&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. the site gazetteer in F.-R. Herrmann &amp; A. Jockenhövel 1990: ''Die Vorgeschichte Hessens'', Stuttgart: Theiss, p. 305-505&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The discoveries at Glauberg have added several new perspectives to the understanding of early Celtic Europe. They have somewhat expanded the known extent of early La Tène civilization, they have thrown much light on the early development of Celtic art, and most importantly of sculpture. The warrior figure and other material support suggestions of links and contact with the civilisations of the [[Mediterranean]] at this early point. The ritual complex surrounding the tomb has added a whole new monument type to European [[prehistory]].&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Sites like Glauberg, sometimes referred to as ''Fürstensitze'' (seats of princes), indicate a parallel development of social hierarchies developing across late Hallstatt Europe. Elite sites, characterised by massive fortifications, the presence of imported materials and of elaborate burials developed along the important trade routes across the continent. Glauberg must now be considered a proto-urban centre of power, trade and cult, of similar importance to such sites as [[Bibracte]], or [[Oppidum of Manching|Manching]], but especially of other "princely" fortified settlements, such as [[Heuneburg]], [[Hohenasperg]] and [[Mont Lassois]].

==Archaeological park and museum==
[[Image:Museum-Keltenwelt-am-Glauberg 0622.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Museum ''Keltenwelt'' at Glauberg]]
An archaeological park has been built, with the aim of making the site and its context accessible and comprehensible to visitors and providing a space for exhibiting the finds locally. Previously, some of the finds, including the statue, were on display in the Hessian State Museum at [[Darmstadt]].

Construction for the museum started in 2007, with completion originally projected for 2009. It opened on 5 May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/-01tojz ''Eine Heimstatt für die Wetterauer Kelten'']. FAZ.NET. Accessed 5 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2015, the museum had counted around 300,000 visitors and estimated the total number of people who had come to see the ''Keltenwelt'' (i.e. including those who just explored the 30 ha open air archaeological park) at around 500,000.&lt;ref name = "AID"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Allihn|first=Karen|title=Ein Jubiläum für den Keltenfürsten| newspaper = Archäologie in Deutschland|date=April 2016| language = de |publisher=WBG|pages=68–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |68}}

'''Grendel's mother''' ({{lang-ang|Grendles mōðor}}) is one of three [[antagonist]]s in the anonymous [[Old English literature|Old English poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]'' (c. 700–1000 AD). The other antagonists are [[Grendel]] and the [[The Dragon (Beowulf)|dragon]], all aligned in opposition to the hero [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]]. She is introduced in lines 1258b to 1259a as: "Grendles modor/ides, aglæcwif".

Grendel's mother, who is never given a name in the text, is the subject of ongoing controversy among [[medieval]] [[scholars]]. This is due to the ambiguity of a few [[Old English language|words in Old English]] which appear in the original [[Nowell Codex|''Beowulf'' manuscript]]. While there is consensus over the word "modor" (mother), the phrase "ides, aglæcwif" is the subject of scholarly debate.

==Story==
{{main|Beowulf}}
The poem, ''[[Beowulf]],'' is contained in the [[Nowell Codex]]. As noted in lines 106–114 and lines 1260–1267 of ''Beowulf,'' monsters (which include Grendel's mother and [[Grendel]]) are descendants of [[Cain and Abel|Cain]]. After Grendel is killed, Grendel's mother attacks [[Heorot]] in revenge. Beowulf then ventures into her cave under a lake, and engages in fierce combat with Grendel's mother. She nearly kills him until he sees an ancient sword, which he kills her with, and beheads the dead Grendel. Beowulf then returns to the surface and to his men at the "ninth hour" (l. 1600, "nōn", about 3&amp;nbsp;pm).&lt;ref&gt;Jack, George. ''Beowulf: A Student Edition,'' p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function in and structure of the poem==
[[Image:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|150 px|right|The first page of the ''[[Beowulf]]'' manuscript.]]
Some scholars have argued that the female characters in ''Beowulf'' fulfill certain established roles such as ''hostess'' ([[Wealhþeow]] and [[Hygd]]) and [[peace-weaver]] ([[Freawaru]] and [[Hildeburh]]). Grendel's mother and [[Modthryth]] (before her marriage to [[Offa of Angel|Offa]]), who challenge these roles, represent "monster-women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first= Dorothy | last=Porter| url=http://www.heroicage.org/issues/5/porter1.html| title=The Social Centrality of Women in ''Beowulf'': A New Context| journal=The Heroic Age: A Journal of Early Medieval Northwestern Europe |issue=5| date=Summer–Autumn 2001| accessdate=2006-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jane Chance argues in "The Structural Unity of ''Beowulf'': The Problem of Grendel's Mother"&lt;ref name="Chance"&gt;Nitzsche, Jane Chance (1980). "The Structural Unity of ''Beowulf'': The Problem of Grendel's Mother." ''Texas Studies in Literature and Language'' '''22'''(3): 287–303. {{JSTOR|40754612}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there are two standard interpretations of the poem: one view which suggests a two-part structure (i.e., the poem is divided between Beowulf's battles with [[Grendel]] and with the dragon) and the other, a three-part structure (this interpretation argues that Beowulf's battle with Grendel's mother is structurally separate from his battle with Grendel). Chance stated that, "this view of the structure as two-part has generally prevailed since its inception in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics]]'' in ''Proceedings of the British Academy 22'' (1936)."&lt;ref name="Chance"/&gt; In contrast, she argued that the three-part structure has become "increasingly popular".&lt;ref name="Chance"/&gt; She later developed this argument in ''Woman as Hero in Old English Literature.''&lt;ref&gt;Nitzsche, Jane Chance. ''Woman as Hero in Old English Literature.'' Syracuse, N.Y.: Syracuse University Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates on Grendel's mother==
There is ongoing debate among medieval scholars concerning the ambiguity of a few [[Old English language|words in Old English]] (related to Grendel's mother) which appear in the original ''[[Nowell Codex|Beowulf manuscript]]''. Because these terms are ambiguous, scholars disagree over aspects of her nature and appearance. Indeed, because her exact appearance is never directly described in [[Old English]] by the original ''Beowulf'' poet, part of the debate revolves around what is known, namely her descent from the biblical [[Cain and Abel|Cain]] (who was the first murderer, according to the [[Abrahamic religion]]s).  For some scholars, this descent links her and Grendel to the monsters and giants of the ''[[Cain tradition]],''&lt;ref&gt;[[David Williams (medievalist)|Williams, David]]. ''Cain and Beowulf: A Study in Secular Allegory''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; while others such as Kevin Kiernan in ''Grendel's Heroic Mother''&lt;ref&gt;Kiernan, Kevin S. "[http://www.uky.edu/~kiernan/iconic/GrendelesHeroicMother.htm Grendel's Heroic Mother]." In ''Geardagum: Essays on Old English Language and Literature'' 6 (1984): 13–33.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that there is "plenty of evidence for defending Grendel's mother as a heroic figure" &lt;ref&gt;Kiernan, Kevin S. "[http://www.uky.edu/~kiernan/iconic/GrendelesHeroicMother.htm Grendel's Heroic Mother]." In ''Geardagum: Essays on Old English Language and Literature'' 6 (1984): 31.&lt;/ref&gt; as she "accepted and adhered to the heroic ethic of the blood-feud, the main difference between Grendel's feckless feud with the noise at Heorot and his mother's purposeful one exacting retribution for the death of her son. In heroic terms, her vengeance for the death of her kinsman Grendel."&lt;ref&gt;Kiernan, Kevin S. "[http://www.uky.edu/~kiernan/iconic/GrendelesHeroicMother.htm Grendel's Heroic Mother]." In ''Geardagum: Essays on Old English Language and Literature'' 6 (1984): 24–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

This lack of consensus has led to the production of a few seminal texts by scholars over the past few decades. One important focus of these articles and books concerns the numerous, and at times opposing, translations of especially the [[Old English]] compound "ides aglæcwif" (1259a).

===Monster or demon===
Until the late 1970s, all scholarship on Grendel's mother and translations of the phrase "aglæc-wif" were influenced by the edition of noted ''Beowulf'' scholar [[Frederick Klaeber]]. His edition, ''Beowulf and the Fight at Finnsburg'', has been considered a standard in ''Beowulf'' scholarship since its first publication in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/modern_language_quarterly/v060/60.2bloomfield.pdf Bloomfield, Josephine. Benevolent Authoritarianism in Klaeber's Beowulf: An Editorial Translation of Kingship. "Modern Language Quarterly 60:2, June 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Klaeber's glossary, "aglæc-wif" translates as: "wretch, or monster of a woman". Klaeber's glossary also defines "aglæca/æglæca" as "monster, demon, fiend" when referring to [[Grendel]] or Grendel's mother and as "warrior, hero" when referring to the character [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Klaeber|Klaeber, Frederick]].

Klaeber has influenced many translations of ''Beowulf.'' Notable interpretations of  "aglæc-wif" which follow Klaeber include "monstrous hell bride" (Heaney),&lt;ref name="Beowulf: A New Verse Translation"&gt;[[Seamus Heaney|Heaney, Seamus]] ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0393320979&amp;id=ynD9o-LfTDMC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=4rtZ-a90PG&amp;dq=Beowulf:+A+New+Verse+Translation&amp;sig=TANJDD5siOW13PupnLi4qiw6SYk Beowulf: A New Verse Translation]''.

Doreen M.E. Gillam's 1961 essay, "The Use of the Term 'Æglæca' in Beowulf at Lines 893 and 2592," explores Klaeber's dual use of the term "aglæca/æglæca" for the heroes [[Sigmund|Sigemund]] and Beowulf as well as for Grendel and Grendel's mother.&lt;ref&gt;Gillam, Doreen M. "The Use of the Term 'Aeglaeca' in Beowulf at Lines 893 and 2592." ''Studia Germanica Gandensia'' 3 (1961): 145–69.&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that "aglæca/æglæca" is used in works besides ''Beowulf'' to reference both "devils and human beings". She further argues that this term is used to imply "supernatural," "unnatural" or even "inhuman" characteristics, as well as hostility towards other creatures.&lt;ref&gt;Gillam, Doreen M. "The Use of the Term 'Aeglaeca' in Beowulf at Lines 893 and 2592." ''Studia Germanica Gandensia'' 3 (1961).&lt;/ref&gt; Gillam suggests: "Beowulf, the champion of men against monsters, is almost inhuman himself. [Aglæca/æglæca] epitomises, in one word, the altogether exceptional nature of the dragon fight. Beowulf, the champion of good, the 'monster' amongst men, challenges the traditional incarnation of evil, the Dragon: æglæca meets æglæcan."&lt;ref&gt;Gillam, Doreen M. "The Use of the Term 'Aeglaeca' in Beowulf at Lines 893 and 2592." ''Studia Germanica Gandensia'' 3 (1961):169.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ides/dis (lady)===

[[Image:Freya by Penrose.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Freyja, depicted in a painting by J. Penrose.]]

The [[Old English language|Old English]] ''[[Idis (Germanic)|ides]]'', [[Old High German]] ''itis'' and Old Norse ''[[dís]]'' are cognates that all mean "lady,"&lt;ref name="nordisk"&gt;The article ''[http://runeberg.org/nfbf/0272.html Dis]'' in ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' (1907).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''idisi'' appears as the name of the [[Valkyrie]]s in the only surviving pagan source in [[Old High German]], the ''[[Merseburg Incantations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin, Thomas. ''An Anthology of German Literature'', D. C. Heath &amp; co. ASIN: B0008BTK3E,B00089RS3K.  P5.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, in [[Norse mythology]], the ''[[Dísir]]'' ('ladies') are fate goddesses who can be both benevolent and antagonistic towards mortal people.

Consequently, many have pointed out that ''dís'' is probably the original term for the [[valkyrie]]s (lit. "choosers of the slain"), which in turn would be a [[kenning]] for ''dís''.&lt;ref&gt;'''Including:''' Ström, Folke (1954) ''Diser, nornor, valkyrjor: Fruktberhetskult och sakralt kungadöme i Norden''; Näsström, and Britt-Mari (1995) ''Freyja: The Great Goddess of the North''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few scholars have drawn from the work of [[Eric Stanley]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Stanley|Stanley, Eric]]. "[http://nq.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/23/8/339 Did Beowulf Commit 'Feaxfeng' against Grendel's Mother]" ''Notes and Queries'' 23 (1976): 339–40. {{doi|10.1093/nq/23-8-339}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Eric. "Two Old English Poetic Phrases Insufficiently Understood for Literary Criticism: Þing Gehegan and Senoþ Gehegan." ''Old English Poetry: Essays on Style''. Ed. Daniel G. Calder. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1979. 67–90.&lt;/ref&gt; by exploring the term ''ides'' as "lady" when discussing Grendel's mother, such as Temple ("Grendel's Lady-Mother," 1986)&lt;ref&gt;Temple, Mary Kay. "Beowulf 1258–1266: Grendel's Lady Mother." ''English Language Notes'' 23.3 (March 1986): 10–15.&lt;/ref&gt; and Taylor&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Keith. "Beowulf 1259a: The Inherent Nobility of Grendel's Mother." ''English Language Notes'' 31.3 (March 1994): 13–25.&lt;/ref&gt; (who argues in his 1994 essay that the term ''Ides'' indicates that "Grendel's mother is a woman of inherently noble status.")&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Keith. "Beowulf 1259a: The Inherent Nobility of Grendel's Mother." ''English Language Notes'' 31.3 (March 1994): 18&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, others have suggested that Grendel's mother may be associated with the [[Norse paganism|Norse]] figures of the [[valkyrie]]s and of the goddess [[Gefjun|Gefion]] who may be an extension of [[Gefjun#Possible connections with Frigg and Freyja|Frigg and Freyja]]. [[Freyja]], the daughter of the sea god [[Njörðr]], was both a [[fertility goddess]] and a goddess of [[war]], [[battle]], [[death]], [[seiðr]], [[prophecy]] and was also sometimes [[Valkyrie#Connections with Freyja|associated with the valkyries and disir]].

[[Nora Kershaw Chadwick]] (1959)&lt;ref&gt;[[Nora Kershaw Chadwick|Chadwick, Nora K.]] "The Monsters and Beowulf." ''The Anglo-Saxons: Studies in Some Aspects of Their History''. Ed. Peter ed Clemoes. London: Bowes &amp; Bowes, 1959. 171–203.&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Helen Damico]] in two works (''Beowulf's Wealhtheow and the Valkyrie Tradition''&lt;ref&gt;[[Helen Damico|Damico, Helen]]. ''Beowulf's Wealhtheow and the Valkyrie Tradition.'' Madison, Wis.: University of Wisconsin Press, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Valkyrie Reflex in Old English Literature")&lt;ref&gt;Damico, Helen. "The Valkyrie Reflex in Old English Literature." In ''New Readings on Women in Old English Literature''. Eds. Helen Damico and Alexandra Hennessey Olsen. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990. 176–89&lt;/ref&gt; argue that Grendel's mother may refer to the myth of the valkyries. Damico states:

{{quote|in both their benevolent and malevolent aspects, the valkyries are related to a generic group of half-mortal, half-supernatural beings called ''idisi'' in Old High German, ''ides'' in Old English, and ''dis'' in Old Norse, plural, ''disir''. Both groups are closely allied in aspect and function: they are armed, powerful, priestly [...] The Beowulf poet follows the tradition of depicting the valkyrie-figure as a deadly battle demon in his characterization of Grendel's Mother. As Chadwick has argued, Grendel's Mother, that ''wælgæst wæfre'' 'roaming slaughter-spirit' epitomizes the earlier concept of the valkyrie.&lt;ref name=reflex&gt;Damico, Helen. "The Valkyrie Reflex in Old English Literature." In ''New Readings on Women in Old English Literature,'' Eds. Helen Damico and Alexandra Hennessey Olsen. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990: 176, 178.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Damico later argues in ''Beowulf's Wealhtheow and the Valkyrie Tradition'' that Wealtheow and Grendel's mother represent different aspects of the valkyries.

Frank Battaglia also draws on the term "ides" by pairing it with "dis".&lt;ref&gt;Battaglia, Frank. "[http://www.unz.org/Pub/MankindQuarterly-1991q2-00415 The Germanic Earth Goddess in Beowulf]." ''Mankind Quarterly'' 31.4 (Summer 1991): 415–46.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that the "dis" were "female guardian spirit[s]" with "power over the dead and choosing who would die. In this capacity [they] might be feared."&lt;ref&gt;Battaglia, Frank. "[http://www.unz.org/Pub/MankindQuarterly-1991q2-00415 The Germanic Earth Goddess in Beowulf]" in ''Mankind Quarterly'', page 433. Summer 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Battaglia thus suggests that Grendel's mother is the Early Germanic goddess Gefion (whom he states was also a form of [[Nerthus]] and Freyja).&lt;ref&gt;Battaglia, Frank. "The Germanic Earth Goddess in Beowulf" in ''Mankind Quarterly'', page 415–17. Summer 1991&lt;/ref&gt; He also argues that: "in scaldic poetry the word ''dis'' means goddess [...] [[Freyja|Freyia]] herself is called ''Vanadis,'' that is, ''dis'' of the Vanir, the Scandinavian [[chthonic]], fertility deities."&lt;ref&gt;Battaglia, Frank. "The Germanic Earth Goddess in Beowulf" in ''Mankind Quarterly'', page 436. Summer 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Battaglia then notes that Gefion is referenced five times in the poem: l.49 (''géafon on gársecg'' – "Gefion on the waves"), l.362 (''ofer geofenes begang'' –  "over Gefion's realm"), l.515 (''geofon ýþum'' – "Gefion welled up in waves"), l.1394 (''né on gyfenes grund'' – "Ground of Gefion"), and l.1690 (''gifen géotende'' – "Gefion gushing"). In addition, he indicates that "in Old English poetry, geofon is a word for ocean which has been seen since [[Jakob Grimm]] (1968, 198) as related to the name Gefion of the Danish Earth Goddess ... power to divide land and sea is shown by representations of Gefion in Norse literature."&lt;ref&gt;Battaglia, Frank. "The Germanic Earth Goddess in Beowulf" in ''The Mankind Quarterly'', page 416. Summer 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aglæcwif (warrior)===
Contemporary scholars have suggested that the use of the term "aglæcwif" indicates that Grendel's mother is a [[women warriors in literature and culture|woman warrior]]. In 1979, ''Beowulf'' scholars Kuhn and Stanley argued against Klaeber's reading of Grendel's mother. In ''Old English Aglaeca-Middle Irish Olach''&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Sherman M. "Old English Aglaeca-Middle Irish Olach." In ''Linguistic Method: Essays in Honor of Herbert Penzl''. Eds. Irmengard Rauch and Gerald F. Carr. The Hague, New York: Mouton Publishers, 1979. 213–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Sherman Kuhn questioned Klaeber's translations of both "aglæc-wif" and of "aglæca / æglæca" when referring to Grendel and Grendel's mother, stating that there are {{quote|five disputed instances of áglæca [three of which are in ''Beowulf''] 649, 1269, 1512 ... In the first ... the referent can be either Beowulf or Grendel. If the poet and his audience felt the word to have two meanings, 'monster', and 'hero', the ambiguity would be troublesome; but if by áglæca they understood a 'fighter', the ambiguity would be of little consequence, for battle was destined for both Beowulf and Grendel and both were fierce fighters.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, S. (1979). "Old English Aglæca-Middle Irish Olach." ''Linguistic Method: Essays in Honor of Herbert Penzl,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;216–217. Mouton Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Thus Kuhn suggested aglæca should be defined as  "a fighter, valiant warrior, dangerous opponent, one who struggles fiercely". &lt;ref name="Kuhn218"&gt;Kuhn, S. (1979). "Old English Aglæca-Middle Irish Olach." ''Linguistic Method: Essays in Honor of Herbert Penzl'', p.&amp;nbsp;218. Mouton Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; He supported his argument by also stating that, "if there were one clear instance of áglæca referring to an unwarlike monster, a peaceful demon, or the like, this definition would fall apart."&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, S. (1979). "Old English Aglæca-Middle Irish Olach." ''Linguistic Method: Essays in Honor of Herbert Penzl'', p.&amp;nbsp;227. Mouton Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Kuhn concluded that {{quote|Grendel's mother was an 'aglæc-wif', 'a female warrior' [...] there is no more reason to introduce the idea of monstrosity or of misery here than there is in line 1519 where she is called ''merewif'', defined simply as 'water-woman', 'woman of the mere'.&lt;ref name="Kuhn218"/&gt;}}

[[Eric Stanley]] added to the debate by critiquing both Klaeber and Gillam: {{quote|Grendel is described as an æglæca, a word which we do not understand. One scholar [Gillam] has, in fact, made investigation of this word a model for the methodology of establishing meaning. The attempt is of interest, but in the end we always come back to the fact that, as Klaeber's glossary shows, the word is used by the poet not only to describe Grendel as here, and later in the poem to describe the dragon, and the monsters of the mere as they attack Beowulf, but also Beowulf himself; and at one point the two enemies, Beowulf and the dragon, are described together using the plural æglæcean. As we assemble the many uses including compounds [...] it becomes clear that it is not pejorative in force. We must not follow Klaeber's distinction of 'wretch, monster, demon, fiend' for Beowulf's enemies, and 'warrior, hero' for Beowulf himself; and we must not abuse Grendel's mother when she is called aglæcwif by translating the word as Klaeber does, 'wretch,' or 'monster, of a woman.' We must never forget that she is called there ides aglæcwif (1259) and ''[[Idis (Germanic)|ides]]'', 'lady,' is not a term of abuse [...] the poet does not speak of his monsters abusively.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, E.G. (1979). "Two Old English Poetic Phrases Insufficiently Understood for Literary Criticism : Þing Gehegan and Senoþ Gehegan." ''Old English Poetry: Essays on Style'', pp.&amp;nbsp;75–76. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Other scholars have offered varying opinions on this topic. Christine Alfano also questioned standard translations related to Grendel's mother.&lt;ref&gt;Alfano, Christine.  (1992). "[http://repositories.cdlib.org/cmrs/comitatus/vol23/iss1/art1/ The Issue of Feminine Monstrosity: A Re-evaluation of Grendel's Mother]." ''Comitatus'', 23: 1–16.&lt;/ref&gt; She states that she found a "noticeable disparity between the Grendel's mother originally created by the ''Beowulf'' poet and the one that occupies contemporary ''Beowulf'' translations. Instead of being what Sherman Kuhn calls a 'female warrior', the modern Grendel's mother is a monster. This assumption informs almost all areas of ''Beowulf'' scholarship, although there is little evidence for this characterization in the original Anglo-Saxon work."&lt;ref&gt;Alfano, Christine.  (1992). "[http://repositories.cdlib.org/cmrs/comitatus/vol23/iss1/art1/ The Issue of Feminine Monstrosity: A Re-evaluation of Grendel's Mother]." ''Comitatus'', 23: 1–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Melinda Menzer offered a different approach,&lt;ref&gt;Menzer, Melinda J. (September 1996). "Aglaecwif (Beowulf 1259a): Implications for -Wif Compounds, Grendel's Mother, and Other Aglaecan." ''English language notes'' 34.1: 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that "aglæcwif denotes a woman, a human female, who is also aglæca."&lt;ref&gt;Menzer, Melinda J. (September 1996). "Aglaecwif (Beowulf 1259a): Implications for -Wif Compounds, Grendel's Mother, and Other Aglaecan." English language notes 34.1: 2&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dictionary of Old English ====
The ''[[Dictionary of Old English]]'', [[University of Toronto]], made the following updates in 1994:
* ''āglāc-wíf'' (noun) is translated as ''female warrior, fearsome woman''.
* ''āglæca'' (adj.) is translated as ''formidable, awe-inspiring''
* ''āglæca'' (noun) is translated as ''awesome opponent, ferocious fighter''&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Angus, et al. (1986 / 1994). "Aglac-Wif to Aglaeca." ''[[Dictionary of Old English]]''. Toronto: Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies. (Published for the Dictionary of Old English Project Centre for Medieval Studies University of Toronto.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1994 DOE translations were supported by George Jack in his 1997 glossary of ''Beowulf'' and [[Bruce Mitchell (scholar)|Bruce Mitchell]] in his 1998 glossary of ''Beowulf.''&lt;ref&gt;Jack, G. (1997). ''Beowulf : A Student Edition''. New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Mitchell (scholar)|Mitchell, Bruce]], et al. (1998).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4246">'''''Hrings saga ok Tryggva''''' is a medieval [[Icelandic saga]] about Hringr, the son of King Dagr. It is one of the [[romance sagas]] which were inspired by Continental romances. It survives only fragmentarily, though there are ''[[rímur]]'' which preserve the full story.&lt;ref&gt;Kalinke and Mitchell 1985 p54&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Finnur Jónsson]] links this saga to ''[[Hálfdanar saga Eysteinssonar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Schröder 1917 p81&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is evidence to suggest otherwise as Schröder argues the opposite and suggests that they are very different in nature. He calls this saga 'a purely literary romance novel',&lt;ref&gt;Schröder 1917 p82&lt;/ref&gt; contrasting with ''Hálfdanar saga'' because of the latter's old fairy-tale tone.

==Summary==
Kalinke and Mitchell give a brief summary of this saga:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hringr, son of King Dagr of Grikkland, is betrothed to Brynhildr, daughter of the king of Garðariki. During a prolonged absence by Hringr, Brynhildr is married to Tryggvi, King of Saxland, however, in return for his assistance in defeating another suitor. When Hringr learns of these events he immediately goes to Saxland, where he engages Tryggvi in combat. The rivals become reconciled, and Hringr marries Brynveig, Tryggvi's sister. When a disloyal follower kills Tryggvi, Brynveig dies of grief, and Hringr avenges Tryggvi. The tale ends with the wedding of Hringr and Brynhildr.&lt;ref&gt;Kalinke and Mitchell 1985 p54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We also know that Hertryggr (Garðariki), a contemporary king, wanted to oppose one of the suitors for his daughter, a Viking known as Harekr, who appears as a savior and member of the social elite however not the Saxon king, who was the Tryggvi mentioned in this saga. Tryggvi declared himself ready to help Hertyggr if he gets his daughter Brynhildr in return, Who at this point is already engaged to John Hringr. Since it was her fathers will and she was desperate to get rid of Harekr, she promised him, and Tryggvi defeated the Harekr the Viking. When he calls Brynhildr, he learns Hringr is on his was back to Saxland - On Hringr's return journey he tells another Icelander, Eirikr, that he wants Tryggvi dead. Tryggvi meets this man and a fight ensues and Eirikr is killed.&lt;ref&gt;Schröder 1917 p82&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscripts==
The saga is attested in a plethora of manuscripts some which are listed here:

[[File:Arvid Liljelund - Man Singing Hymn - A I 187 - Finnish National Gallery.jpg|thumb|[[Arvid Liljelund]]'s ''Man Singing Hymn'' (1884)]]
A '''hymn''' is a type of [[song]], usually [[religious]], specifically written for the purpose of adoration or [[prayer]], and typically addressed to a [[deity]] or deities, or to a prominent figure or [[personification]]. The word ''hymn'' derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὕμνος}} (''hymnos''), which means "a song of praise". A writer of hymns is known as a [[hymnodist]]. The singing or composition of hymns is called '''hymnody'''. Collections of hymns are known as [[hymnal]]s or hymn books. Hymns may or may not include instrumental accompaniment.

Although most familiar to speakers of English in the context of [[Christianity]], hymns are also a fixture of other [[major religious groups|world religions]], especially on the Indian subcontinent. Hymns also survive from antiquity, especially from Egyptian and Greek cultures. Some of the oldest surviving examples of notated music are hymns with Greek texts.

==Origins==
Ancient hymns include the [[ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] ''[[Great Hymn to the Aten]]'', composed by [[Pharaoh]] [[Akhenaten]]; the Hurrian [[Hymn to Nikkal]]; the ''[[Vedas]]'', a collection of hymns in the tradition of [[Hinduism]]; and the [[Psalms]], a collection of songs from [[Judaism]]. The Western tradition of hymnody begins with the [[Homeric Hymns]], a collection of ancient Greek hymns, the oldest of which were written in the 7th century BC, praising deities of the [[Religion in ancient Greece|ancient Greek religions]]. Surviving from the 3rd century BC is a collection of six literary hymns ({{lang|grc|Ὕμνοι}}) by the [[Alexandria]]n poet [[Callimachus]].

[[Church Fathers|Patristic]] writers began applying the term {{lang|grc|ὕμνος}}, or ''hymnus'' in [[Latin]], to [[Christian]] songs of praise, and frequently used the word as a synonym for "[[Psalms|psalm]]".&lt;ref&gt;Entry on {{lang|grc|ὕμνος}}, Liddell and Scott, ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 8th edition 1897, 1985 printing), p. 1849; entry on 'hymnus,' Lewis and Short, ''[[A Latin Dictionary]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1879, 1987 printing), p. 872.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Christian hymnody ==
Originally modeled on the [[Psalms|Book of Psalms]] and other poetic passages (commonly referred to as "[[canticle]]s") in the Scriptures, Christian hymns are generally directed as praise to the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]]. Many refer to [[Jesus Christ]] either directly or indirectly.

Since the earliest times, Christians have sung "psalms and hymns and spiritual songs", both in private devotions and in corporate worship ({{bibleverse||Matthew|26:30|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse|Mark|14:26|esv}}; {{bibleverse|Acts|16:25|esv}}; {{bibleverse|1|Cor|14:26|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse||Ephesians|5:19|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse||Colossians|3:16|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse||James|5:13|nrsv}}; cf. {{bibleverse||Revelation|5:8–10|nrsv}}; {{bibleverse||Revelation|14:1–5|nrsv}}).

Non-scriptural hymns (i.e. not psalms or canticles) from the Early Church still sung today include '[[Phos Hilaron]]', '[[Sub tuum praesidium]]', and '[[Te Deum]]'.

One definition of a hymn is "...a lyric poem, reverently and devotionally conceived, which is designed to be sung and which expresses the worshipper's attitude toward God or God's purposes in human life. It should be simple and metrical in form, genuinely emotional, poetic and literary in style, spiritual in quality, and in its ideas so direct and so immediately apparent as to unify a congregation while singing it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | title=Sing with Understanding, An Introduction to Christian Hymnology

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian hymns are often written with special or seasonal themes and these are used on holy days such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] and the Feast of [[All Saints' Day|All Saints]], or during particular seasons such as [[Advent]] and [[Lent]]. Others are used to encourage reverence for the [[Bible]] or to celebrate Christian practices such as the [[eucharist]] or [[baptism]]. Some hymns praise or address individual [[saints]], particularly the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]; such hymns are particularly prevalent in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and to some extent [[High Church]] [[Anglicanism]].

A writer of hymns is known as a hymnodist, and the practice of singing hymns is called ''hymnody''; the same word is used for the collectivity of hymns belonging to a particular denomination or period (e.g. "nineteenth century Methodist hymnody" would mean the body of hymns written and/or used by Methodists in the 19th century). A collection of hymns is called a ''[[hymnal]]'' or ''hymnary''. These may or may not include music. A student of hymnody is called a ''hymnologist'', and the scholarly study of hymns, hymnists and hymnody is [[hymnology]]. The music to which a hymn may be sung is a [[hymn tune]].

In many Evangelical churches, traditional songs are classified as hymns while more contemporary worship songs are not considered hymns. The reason for this distinction is unclear, but according to some it is due to the radical shift of style and devotional thinking that began with the [[Jesus movement]] and [[Jesus music]]. Of note, in recent years, Christian traditional hymns ''have'' seen a revival in some churches, usually more Reformed or [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] in nature, as modern hymn writers such as [[Keith Getty|Keith and Kristyn Getty]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/in-praise-of-hymns/|title=In praise of hymns|access-date=2017-05-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sovereign Grace Churches|Sovereign Grace]] Music have reset old lyrics to new melodies, revised old hymns and republished them, or simply written a song in accordance with Christian hymn standards &lt;sup&gt;[according to whom?]&lt;/sup&gt; such as the hymn, ''[[In Christ Alone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Songs of faith|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/songs-of-faith/|language=en|accessdate=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music and accompaniment ===
In ancient and medieval times, [[string instrument]]s such as the [[harp]], [[lyre]] and [[lute]] were used with psalms and hymns.

Since there is a lack of [[musical notation]] in early writings,&lt;ref&gt;Entry on "Hymn: 4. Hymn Sources and Transmission," Warren Anderson, et al. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/ Grove Music Online] (2007–2009) (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; the actual musical forms in the early church can only be surmised. During the Middle Ages a rich hymnody developed in the form of [[Gregorian chant]] or plainsong. This type was sung in unison, in one of eight [[church modes]], and most often by monastic choirs. While they were written originally in [[Latin]], many have been translated; a familiar example is the 4th century ''[[Of the Father's Heart Begotten]]'' sung to the 11th century plainsong ''Divinum Mysterium''.

==== Western church ====
[[File:St Paul's Cathedral South Organ, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|Hymns are often accompanied by [[pipe organ|organ]] music]]
Later hymnody in the [[Western church]] introduced four-part vocal [[harmony]] as the norm, adopting major and minor keys, and came to be led by [[organ (music)|organ]] and choir. It shares many elements with [[European classical music|classical music]].

Today, except for choirs, more musically inclined congregations and ''[[a cappella]]'' congregations, hymns are typically sung in unison. In some cases complementary full settings for organ are also published, in others organists and other accompanists are expected to transcribe the four-part vocal score for their instrument of choice.

To illustrate [[Protestant]] usage, in the traditional services and liturgies of the [[Methodist]] churches, which are based upon [[Anglican Church|Anglican]] practice, hymns are sung (often accompanied by an organ) during the [[processional hymn|processional]] to the altar, during the receiving of communion, during the [[recessional hymn|recessional]], and sometimes at other points during the service. These hymns can be found in a common book such as the [[United Methodist Hymnal]]. The [[Doxology]] is also sung after the tithes and offerings are brought up to the altar.

[[Contemporary worship|Contemporary Christian worship]], as often found in [[Evangelicalism]] and [[Pentecostalism]], may include the use of [[contemporary worship music]] played with [[electric guitar]]s and the [[drum kit]], sharing many elements with [[rock music]].

Other groups of Christians have historically excluded instrumental accompaniment, citing the absence of instruments in worship by the church in the first several centuries of its existence, and adhere to an unaccompanied ''[[a cappella]]'' congregational singing of hymns. These groups include the 'Brethren' (often both 'Open' and 'Exclusive'), the [[Churches of Christ]], [[Mennonites]], [[Primitive Baptists]], and certain Reformed churches, although during the last century or so, several of these, such as the [[Free Church of Scotland (since 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] have abandoned this stance.

====Eastern church====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
[[Eastern Christianity]] (the [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] churches) has a variety of ancient hymnographical traditions.

[[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine]] chant is almost always [[a cappella]], and instrumental accompaniment is rare. It is used to chant all forms of liturgical worship.

Instruments are common in Oriental traditions. The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] tradition which makes use of the [[cymbal]]s and the [[Triangle (musical instrument)]]. The [[Indian Orthodox]] (Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church) use of the [[organ (music)|organ]]. The [[Tewahedo Church]]es use [[drum]]s, [[cymbal]]s and other instruments on certain occasions.

=== Development of Christian hymnody ===
[[Thomas Aquinas]], in the introduction to his commentary on the Psalms, defined the Christian hymn thus: "''Hymnus est laus Dei cum cantico; canticum autem exultatio mentis de aeternis habita, prorumpens in vocem''." ("A hymn is the praise of God with song; a song is the exultation of the mind dwelling on eternal things, bursting forth in the voice.")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Protestant Reformation]] resulted in two conflicting attitudes towards hymns. One approach, the [[regulative principle of worship]], favoured by many Zwinglians, Calvinists and some radical reformers, considered anything that was not directly authorised by the Bible to be a novel and Catholic introduction to worship, which was to be rejected. All hymns that were not direct quotations from the Bible fell into this category. Such hymns were banned, along with any form of instrumental musical accompaniment, and organs were removed from churches. Instead of hymns, biblical psalms were chanted, most often without accompaniment, to very basic melodies. This was known as [[exclusive psalmody]]. Examples of this may still be found in various places, including in some of the [[Scottish Presbyterian|Presbyterian churches of western Scotland]].

}}
The other Reformation approach, the [[normative principle of worship]], produced a burst of hymn writing and congregational singing. [[Martin Luther]] is notable not only as a reformer, but as the [[List of hymns by Martin Luther|author of many hymns]] including "Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott" ("[[A Mighty Fortress Is Our God]]"), which is sung today even by Catholics, and "[[Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ]]" ("Praise be to You, Jesus Christ") for Christmas. Luther and his followers often used their hymns, or chorales, to teach tenets of the faith to worshipers. The first Protestant hymnal was published in Bohemia in 1532 by the [[Unitas Fratrum]]. Count [[Zinzendorf]], the Lutheran leader of the [[Moravian Church]] in the 18th century wrote some 2,000 hymns. The earlier English writers tended to paraphrase biblical texts, particularly [[Psalm]]s; [[Isaac Watts]] followed this tradition, but is also credited as having written the first English hymn which was not a direct paraphrase of Scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Watts (1674–1748), whose father was an Elder of a dissenter congregation, complained at age 16, that when allowed only psalms to sing, the faithful could not even sing about their Lord, Christ Jesus. His father invited him to see what he could do about it; the result was Watts' first hymn, "Behold the glories of the Lamb".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Relying heavily on Scripture, Watts wrote metered texts based on New Testament passages that brought the Christian faith into the songs of the church. Isaac Watts has been called "the father of English hymnody", but Erik Routley sees him more as "the liberator of English hymnody", because his hymns, and hymns like them, moved worshipers beyond singing only Old Testament psalms, inspiring congregations and revitalizing worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | title = Christian Hymns, An Introduction to Their Story (Audio Book) op. cit.
 | page = Part 7, "Isaac Watts, the Liberator of English Hymnody"
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later writers took even more freedom, some even including [[allegory]] and [[metaphor]] in their texts.

[[Charles Wesley]]'s hymns spread Methodist [[theology]], not only within Methodism, but in most Protestant churches. He developed a new focus: expressing one's personal feelings in the relationship with God as well as the simple worship seen in older hymns. Wesley wrote:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
Where shall my wondering soul begin?
How shall I all to heaven aspire?
A slave redeemed from death and sin,
A brand plucked from eternal fire,
How shall I equal triumphs raise,
Or sing my great deliverer's praise.
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Wesley's contribution, along with the [[Second Great Awakening]] in [[United States|America]] led to a new style called [[Gospel music|gospel]], and a new explosion of sacred music writing with [[Fanny Crosby]], [[Lina Sandell]], [[Philip Bliss]], [[Ira D. Sankey]], and others who produced testimonial music for revivals, camp meetings, and evangelistic crusades. The tune style or form is technically designated "gospel songs" as distinct from hymns. Gospel songs generally include a refrain (or chorus) and usually (though not always) a faster tempo than the hymns. As examples of the distinction, "[[Amazing Grace]]" is a hymn (no refrain), but "[[How Great Thou Art (hymn)|How Great Thou Art]]" is a gospel song. During the 19th century, the gospel-song genre spread rapidly in Protestantism and to a lesser but still definite extent, in Roman Catholicism; the gospel-song genre is unknown in the worship ''per se'' by Eastern Orthodox churches, which rely exclusively on traditional chants (a type of hymn).

The [[Methodist Revival]] of the 18th century created an explosion of hymn-writing in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], which continued into the first half of the 19th century. The most prominent names among Welsh hymn-writers are [[William Williams Pantycelyn]] and [[Ann Griffiths]]. The second half of the 19th century witnessed an explosion of hymn tune composition and congregational four-part singing in [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Wyn James, 'The Evolution of the Welsh Hymn', in ''Dissenting Praise'', ed. I. Rivers &amp; D. L. Wykes (OUP, 2011); E. Wyn James, ‘German Chorales and American Songs and Solos: Contrasting Chapters in Welsh Congregational Hymn-Singing’, ''The Bulletin of the Hymn Society of Great Britain and Ireland'', No. 295, Vol. 22:2 (Spring 2018), 43–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the more classical sacred music of composers ranging from [[Mozart]] to [[Monteverdi]], the [[Catholic Church]] continued to produce many popular hymns such as [[Lead, Kindly Light]], [[Silent Night]], O Sacrament Divine and Faith of our Fathers.

Many churches today use contemporary worship music which includes a range of styles often influenced by [[popular music]]. This often leads to some conflict between older and younger congregants (see [[contemporary worship]]). This is not new; the Christian [[Contemporary Christian Music|pop music]] style began in the late 1960s and became very popular during the 1970s, as young hymnists sought ways in which to make the music of their religion relevant for their generation.

This long tradition has resulted in a wide variety of hymns. Some modern churches include within hymnody the traditional hymn (usually describing God), contemporary worship music (often directed to God) and [[gospel music]] (expressions of one's personal experience of God). This distinction is not perfectly clear; and purists remove the second two types from the classification as hymns. It is a matter of debate, even sometimes within a single congregation, often between revivalist and traditionalist movements.

====American developments====
[[African-American]]s developed a rich hymnody from [[spiritual (music)|spiritual]]s during times of slavery to the modern, lively black gospel style. The first influences of African American Culture into hymns came from Slave Songs of the United States a collection of slave hymns compiled by William Francis Allen who had difficulty pinning them down from the oral tradition, and though he succeeded, he points out the awe inspiring effect of the hymns when sung in by their originators.&lt;ref&gt;Music, David. Hymnology A Collection of Source Readings. 1. 1. Lanham MD: Scarecrow Press, Inc., 1996. 179/185-186/192/199/206. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hymn writing, composition, performance and the publishing of Christian hymnals were prolific in the 19th-century and were often linked to the abolitionist movement by many hymn writers. Surprisingly, [[Stephen Foster]] wrote a number of hymns that were used during church services during this era of publishing.&lt;!-- references forthcoming --&gt;

Thomas Symmes{{clarify|date=January 2011}} spread throughout churches a new idea of how to sing hymns, in which anyone could sing a hymn any way they felt led to; this idea was opposed by the views of Symmes' colleagues{{who|date=January 2011}} who felt it was "like Five Hundred different Tunes roared out at the same time".{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} [[William Billings]], a [[singing school]] teacher, created the first tune book with only American born compositions. Within his books, Billings did not put as much emphasis on "[[common measure]]"{{clarify|date=January 2011}} which was the typical way hymns were sung, but he attempted "to have a Sufficiency in each measure"{{clarify|date=January 2011}}. Boston's [[Handel and Haydn Society]] aimed at raising the level of church music in America, publishing their "Collection of Church Music".{{when|date=January 2011}} In the late 19th century [[Ira D. Sankey]] and [[Dwight L. Moody]] developed the relatively new subcategory of [[gospel hymn]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Music, David. ''Hymnology A Collection of Source Readings''. 1. 1. Lanham MD: Scarecrow Press, Inc., 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in the 19th century, the use of musical notation, especially [[Shape note|shape notes]], exploded in America, and professional singing masters went from town to town teaching the population how to [[Sight-reading|sing from sight]], instead of the more common [[lining out]] that had been used before that. During this period hundreds of tune books were published, including [[Benjamin Franklin White|B.F. White's]] ''[[Sacred Harp]]'', and earlier works like the [[The Missouri Harmony|''Missouri Harmony'']], ''[[Kentucky Harmony]]'', [[The Hesperian Harp|''Hesperian Harp'']], D.H. Mansfield's ''The American Vocalist'', ''The Social Harp'', the ''[[Southern Harmony]]'', [[William Walker (composer)|William Walker]]'s ''[[The Christian Harmony|Christian Harmony]]'', [[Jeremiah Ingalls]]' ''Christian Harmony'', and literally many dozens of others. Shape notes were important in the spread of (then) more modern singing styles, with tenor-led 4-part harmony (based on older English [[West gallery music|West Gallery music]]), [[Fuguing tune|fuging]] sections, [[Anthem|anthems]] and other more complex features. During this period, hymns were incredibly popular in the United States, and one or more of the above-mentioned tunebooks could be found in almost every household. It isn't uncommon to hear accounts of young people and teenagers gathering together to spend an afternoon singing hymns and anthems from tune books, which was considered great fun, and there are surviving accounts of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and his sweetheart singing together from the ''Missouri Harmony'' during his youth. 

By the 1860s musical reformers like [[Lowell Mason]] (the so-called "better music boys") were actively campaigning for the introduction of more "refined" and modern singing styles, and eventually these American tune books were replaced in many churches, starting in the Northeast and urban areas, and spreading out into the countryside as people adopted the gentler, more soothing tones of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] hymnody, and even adopted dedicated, trained [[Choir|choirs]] to do their church's singing, rather than having the entire congregation participate. But in many rural areas the old traditions lived on, not in churches, but in weekly, monthly or annual conventions were people would meet to sing from their favorite tunebooks. The most popular one, and the only one that survived continuously in print, was the ''[[Sacred Harp]]'', which could be found in the typical rural Southern home right up until the living tradition was "re-discovered" by [[Alan Lomax]] in the 1960s (although it had been well-documented by [[Musicology|musicologist]] [[George Pullen Jackson]] prior to this). Indeed, "the most common book on . Since then there has been a renaissance in "Sacred Harp singing", with annual conventions popping up in [[United States|all 50 states]] and in a number of European countries recently, including the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Germany]], [[Ireland]] and [[Poland]], as well as in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacredharpbremen.org/|title=Sacred Harp Bremen|website=www.sacredharpbremen.org|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukshapenote.org.uk/|title=Welcome|last=Macadam|first=Edwin and Sheila|website=www.ukshapenote.org.uk|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sacredharp86.org/|title=Sacred Harp in Poland {{!}} Polish Sacred Harp Community Website|website=sacredharp86.org|language=pl-PL|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;[https://sacredharpaustralia.com/] Today "Sacred Harp singing" is a vibrant and living tradition with thousands of enthusiastic participants all around the globe, drawn to the democratic principles of the tradition and exotic, beautiful sound of the music.

===Hymn meters===
{{main|Meter (hymn)}}
The meter indicates the number of syllables for the lines in each [[stanza]] of a hymn. This provides a means of marrying the hymn's text with an appropriate [[hymn tune]] for singing. In practice many hymns conform to one of a relatively small number of meters (syllable count and stress patterns). Care must be taken, however, to ensure that not only the metre of words and tune match, but also the stresses on the words in each line. Technically speaking an iambic tune, for instance, cannot be used with words of, say, trochaic metre.

The meter is often denoted by a row of figures besides the name of the tune, such as "87.87.87", which would inform the reader that each verse has six lines, and that the first line has eight syllables, the second has seven, the third line eight, etc. The meter can also be described by initials; L.M. indicates long meter, which is 88.88 (four lines, each eight syllables long); S.M. is short meter (66.86); C.M. is common metre (86.86), while D.L.M., D.S.M. and D.C.M. (the "D" stands for double) are similar to their respective single meters except that they have eight lines in a verse instead of four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Children's Britannica

|pages=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, if the number of syllables in one verse differ from another verse in the same hymn (e.g., the hymn "I Sing a Song of the Saints of God"), the meter is called Irregular.

An '''itinerant poet''' or '''strolling minstrel''' (also known variously as a '''gleeman''', '''circler''', or '''cantabank''') was a wandering [[minstrel]], [[bard]], or other [[poet]] common in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Europe]] but extinct today. From a lower class than [[jester]]s or [[jongleur]]s because he did not have steady work, he instead roamed about to make his living.&lt;ref name=BahnBahn1970&gt;{{Cite book |title = A History of Oral Interpretation |last = Bahn |first = Eugene |chapter= Medieval Period |publisher = Burgess Publishing Co. |year = 1970 |isbn = |location = Minneapolis |pages = 56–57 |first2 = Margaret |last2 = Bahn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gleeman ==
In [[Medieval England]], a gleeman was a reciter of poetry. Like the [[scop]], the gleeman performed poetry to the accompaniment of the harp or "glee wood".&lt;ref name=BahnBahn1970 /&gt; The gleeman occasionally attached himself to a single/particular court but was most often a ''wandering'' entertainer, unlike the scop, who was more static. A gleeman was also less likely to compose or perform his own poetry and relied on the work of others for his material.&lt;ref name=BahnBahn1970 /&gt;

[[File:Allegory of the Redemption.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''The Allegory of the Redemption''; [[Madrid]], [[Prado Museum]].]]
'''Jacopo Ligozzi''' (1547–1627) was an [[Italy|Italian]] painter, illustrator, designer, and miniaturist. His art can be categorized as late-[[Renaissance]] and  [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] styles.

==Biography==

Born in [[Verona]], he was the son of the artist [[Giovanni Ermano Ligozzi]], and part of a large family of painters and artisans. After a time in the [[Habsburg]] court in [[Vienna]], where he displayed drawings of animal and botanical specimens, he was invited to come to Florence and became one of the court artists for the [[Medici]].

Upon the death of [[Giorgio Vasari]] in 1574, he became head of the ''[[Accademia delle Arti del Disegno|Accademia e Compagnia delle Arti del Disegno]]'', the officially patronized [[guild of artists]], which was often called to advise on diverse projects. He served [[Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Francesco I]], [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando I]], [[Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo II]] and [[Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando II]], [[Grand Duke]]s of [[Tuscany]].  Late in life, he was named director of the grand-ducal ''Galleria dei Lavori'',&lt;ref&gt;Now called ''Opificio delle pietre dure''; [[:it:Opificio delle pietre dure|See Italian Wikipedia entry.]]&lt;/ref&gt; a workshop providing designs for artworks made mainly for export: embroidered textiles and for the newly popular medium of [[pietre dure]], [[mosaics]] of semiprecious stones and colored marbles.

He painted [[frescoes]] depicting episodes from the life of [[St. Francis of Assisi]] for the [[cloister]] of the [[Church of Ognissanti, Florence|Ognissanti]]. He also painted a canvas of ''St. Raymond resuscitating a Child'' for [[Santa Maria Novella]] and ''Martyrdom of St. Dorothea'' for the church of the Conventuali at [[Pescia]]. His [[altarpiece]]s depict crowds in staged positions, robbed of emotion; the paintings breath an academic staleness that is typical of Florentine painting of the age.

In his many pen-and-wash drawings featuring religious, mythological, or heraldic images, Ligozzi demonstrated a greater originality. He is known best for his depictions of [[fauna]] and [[flora]], which reflect the nascent scientific pursuits of the Medici. His botanically correct depictions of plants can even include exquisitely observed root systems. Ligozzi was commissioned to create some of the depictions found in the encyclopedic visual catalogue of the plant collections of Bolognese [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]] (kept in the [[Gabinetto Disegni e Stampe]] of the [[Uffizi Gallery]]). He can be described as the [[John James Audubon|Audubon]] of late [[Renaissance]] Florence. He is also credited with bringing the lusher color-palette of Verona to Florence.

Ligozzi was influential among some subsequent Florentines including [[Bartolomeo Bimbi]]. Among his pupils were [[Donato Mascagni]], known as Frate Arsenio, and [[Mario Balassi]]. Ligozzi's nephew [[Bartolommeo Ligozzi]] was also a painter. In Florence, he worked on some projects with [[Bernardino Poccetti]]. Both [[Agostino Carracci]] and [[Andrea Andreani]] engraved some of his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Michael| last=Bryan| year=1889| title=‘‘Dictionary of Painters and Engravers, Biographical and Critical’‘ (Volume II L-Z)| editor = Walter Armstrong &amp; Robert Edmund Graves| publisher=George Bell and Sons|location=York St. #4, Covent Garden, London; Original from Fogg Library, Digitized May 18, 2007 |id= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K2cCAAAAYAAJ| authorlink=| page= 57}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in Florence.

'''Jupiter Artland''' is a contemporary [[sculpture park]] and [[art gallery]] in [[West Lothian]], Scotland. Jupiter Artland Foundation is a [[Registered Charity|registered charity]] that is subsidized by classes, workshops, events, ticket sales, and donations. 

Jupiter Artland is open to general visits between May and September.

Jupiter Artland sits in the grounds of [[Bonnington House]], a 19th-century country house around {{convert|7|km}} west of the city of [[Edinburgh]].

The grounds of the house have been developed as the sculpture park and two new wings designed by Benjamin Tindall Architects were completed in 2015 to provide indoor gallery space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jupiterartland.org/story |title=Story |publisher=Jupiter Artland |accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The sculpture collection was established in 1999 by art collectors Robert and Nicky Wilson and "focuses on nurturing the work of contemporary artists and commissioning site-specific work for its 120-acres of woodland and meadow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-36158524|title=V&amp;A up for Museum of the Year £100,000 prize|publisher=BBC News|date=29 April 2016|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Jupiter Artland was shortlisted for the 2016 [[Museum of the Year]] award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artfund.org/prize/news/2016/april/museum-of-the-year-shortlist-announced Artfund]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kostromskaya''' ({{lang-ru|Костромска́я}}) is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|rural locality]] (a ''[[stanitsa]]'') in [[Mostovsky District]] of [[Krasnodar Krai]], [[Russia]], located at the footsteps of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] on the [[Psefir River]] ([[Fars River|Fars]]' [[tributary]], [[Kuban River|Kuban]] [[drainage basin|basin]]), {{convert|15|km|sp=us}} southwest of the town of [[Labinsk]].

With a population estimated in the hundreds, it is very agrarian and rural in nature and has many [[mulberry]] trees.  The roads in the village are mostly dirt or rocky.  The landscape is very mountainous.

The ''stanitsa'' is also home to the ancient [[Scythians|Scythian]] [[kurgan]] or burial mound of the 7th century BC where a Scythian gold stag was found, next to the iron shield it decorated. It is one of the most famous pieces of [[Scythian art]], and is now in the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[St Petersberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Honour and Fleming, 124&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from the principal male body with his accoutrements, the burial included thirteen humans with no adornment above him, and around the edges of the burial twenty-two [[horse burial|horses were buried]] in pairs.&lt;ref&gt;Honour and Fleming, 123&lt;/ref&gt; The kurgan was excavated by the Russian archaeologist [[Nikolai Ivanovich Veselovsky|N. I. Veselovski]] in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovsky, 29&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Trial by Jury''''', or '''''Laying Down the Law''''' as it is commonly known, is an oil-on-canvas painting from [[1840 in art|1840]] by the English painter [[Sir Edwin Landseer]], which satirises the legal profession. It depicts dogs in the roles of members of the court with a [[poodle|French poodle]] centre stage as the judge. The painting was inspired by a chance comment by a judge, while at dinner with Landseer, that the French poodle belonging to amateur artist and renowned socialite, the [[Alfred Guillaume Gabriel, Count D'Orsay|Count d'Orsay]], "would make a capital Lord Chancellor".

Landseer was a member of the [[Royal Academy]] and had become famous for his paintings and drawings of animals. His later works include ''[[Monarch of the Glen (painting)|The Monarch of the Glen]]'', an iconic and much-reproduced painting of a stag in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], and the sculptures of the lions at the foot of [[Nelson's Column]] in [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]].

He completed ''Trial by Jury'' in 1840 — it was exhibited at the Royal Academy in the same year and was acquired by [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire]], who had Landseer add his [[spaniel|Blenheim spaniel]], Bony, into the scene behind the [[greyhound]]. Early copies of the painting can be seen with Bony absent. The original now hangs in the Sculpture Gallery at [[Chatsworth House]]. The poodle has been variously identified as representing [[Lord Brougham]], who had been [[Lord Chancellor]] from 1830 to 1834, or [[Lord Lyndhurst]], who had held the post three times (1827&amp;ndash;1830, 1834&amp;ndash;1835, and 1841&amp;ndash;1846).

A '''lead single''' is usually the first [[single (music)|single]] to be released from a [[studio album]], by a [[musician]] or a [[band (music)|band]], before the [[album]] itself is released.

==Early singles==

During the era of the [[gramophone record]], all music arrived in the marketplace as what is now termed a single, one potential [[hit single|hit song]] backed by an additional song of generally less commercial appeal on a single ten-inch [[78 rpm]] [[shellac]] record. After the launch of the [[LP record|long-playing microgroove record]] in 1948 and the arrival of the 45 rpm [[single (music)|single]] the following year, singles continued to appear separately from albums into the 1960s. For instance, the early [[rock and roll]] market of the 1950s and early 1960s was very much focused on singles rather than albums. Songs such as "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]", "[[Johnny B. Goode]]", and "[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]" only appeared later on album compilations of singles. Even through the 1960s, leading rock artists such as [[The Beatles]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[The Rolling Stones]] issued songs such as "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]", "[[Penny Lane]]," "[[Good Vibrations]]", "[[Positively 4th Street]]", and "[[Honky Tonk Women]]" as singles apart from any contemporary albums.

==Shifting to album singles==

This changed in the 1970s as the popular music industry shifted to the album as its main profit center. Singles became advertisements for an album, the lead single conceptually defined as a foretaste of the album to come. On average a lead single will appear about one month before the album's release date. "[[Go Your Own Way]]" from ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'', "[[Miss You (The Rolling Stones song)|Miss You]]" from ''[[Some Girls]]'', and "[[The Girl Is Mine]]" from ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' all roughly follow this pattern. This has become a common practice through the 21st century for album-oriented recording artists.

==Promotion==

Lead singles are often a deciding factor for consumers debating purchase of a still unissued album, and the choosing of which track from an album to be issued as the lead single can be crucial to the album's commercial success. The standard rejoinder for record company executives, when presented with an album of dubious commercial potential, is "I don't hear the single."

==More than one lead single of an album==

In the 2000s, a common trend developed to release a lead single months in advance of the album release date. It has equally become common for a second lead single to be released before the release of the album. For example, [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] issued the lead single "[[Love in this Club]]" four months prior to the May 29, 2008 release of ''[[Here I Stand (Usher album)|Here I Stand]]''. The second single "[[Love in This Club, Pt. II]]" was released one month before the album release date. Another example is [[Justin Timberlake]]'s 2013 album, [[The 20/20 Experience]], which was released on March 19, 2013. The first single off it is "[[Suit &amp; Tie]]", released 2 months before the album hit stores. 1 month prior to the release of the album, another lead single called, "[[Mirrors (Justin Timberlake song)|Mirrors]]", was released. {{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Katy Perry released "[[California Gurls]]" as a single on May 7, 2010, and "[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry song)|Teenage Dream]]" on July 23, 2010, leading to the release of the album "[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry album)|Teenage Dream]]" on August 24, 2010.

==Lead singles of albums in the twenty-first century==

Artists often choose songs that are more [[up-tempo]] as lead singles.  Such songs are often catchier and attract attention toward listeners. However, the subsequent lead single might be slower in tempo in order to demonstrate the range of the album. Female vocalists like [[Mariah Carey]] and [[Christina Aguilera]] often maintain a formula of an up-tempo first lead single with a slow [[ballad]] follow-up. For example, two singles were released by [[Miley Cyrus]] before her album ''[[Bangerz]]'' - an up-tempo track called, "[[We Can't Stop]]" was released as the first single, and a slow-ballad song, "[[Wrecking Ball (Miley Cyrus song)|Wrecking Ball]]" as the second. This was a successful practice of 1980s [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands. However, not all artists decide to choose their lead single with the up-tempo criteria. Artists may release a lead single that has a message they want to convey to listeners instead of a song with more commercial potential, such as [[Fall Out Boy]] who chose to release "[[This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race]]" over the radio friendly "[[Thnks fr th Mmrs]]".&lt;ref name="RSDeets"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/exclusive-fall-out-boy-album-deets-20061116|title=Exclusive: Fall Out Boy Album Deets|date=November 16, 2006|accessdate=December 12, 2014|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Jann Wenner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese artists such as [[Ayumi Hamasaki]], [[Namie Amuro]] and [[B'z]] may release four to eight singles prior to their albums in order to achieve record-breaking debut-week sales. The lead singles in Japan are very heavily advertised and promoted, in some cases even more than the album itself. With album sales continuously declining in the United States, record labels often release singles prior to the album's release date to online music retailers including [[iTunes]], ranging in price from $0.99 to $1.29. This trend has become increasingly popular in many markets.

==Unannounced single==

In the digital era of music, many artists have driven away from the traditional single release and have started releasing lead singles to their upcoming projects without prior notice or promotion. [[Beyoncé]] popularized this formula with the release of "[[Formation (song)|Formation]]" in 2016, which served as the lead single to her sixth studio album. The song, accompanied by its music video, was uploaded to [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]] without previous announcement by Beyoncé.

'''Pacific Comics''' (PC) was an independent [[comic book]] publisher that flourished from 1981-1984. It was also a chain of comics shops and a distributor. It began out of a [[San Diego, California]], comic book shop owned by brothers [[Bill Schanes|Bill]] and Steve Schanes.  Along with competitors like [[First Comics]] and [[Eclipse Comics]], PC took early advantage of the growing [[direct market]], attracting a number of writers and artists from [[DC Comics|DC]] and [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] to produce [[creator ownership|creator-owned]] titles, which were not subject to the [[Comics Code]], and thus were free to feature more mature content.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
In 1971, the Schanes brothers (Steve Schanes, age 17, and Bill Schanes, age 13&lt;ref name="DAK54"/&gt;) co-founded Pacific Comics, which started out as a mail-order company, selling to consumers via ads in the ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]''. This led to advertisements inside some [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comics, and ultimately to tangible retail stores. The first Pacific Comics store opened in [[Pacific Beach, California]], in 1974, and business was soon doing so well that the brothers realized they "couldn't get merchandise" for the stores, and so set up a distribution system, which was soon supplying neighboring stores also.&lt;ref name="Sanford"&gt;[[Jay Allen Sanford|Sanford, Jay Allen]]. [http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2004/aug/19/two-men-and-their-comic-books/ "Two Men and their Comic Books]," ''[[San Diego Reader]]'' (Aug. 19, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

The move from newsstand distribution to the [[direct market]] (non-returnable, heavily-discounted, direct purchasing of comics from publishers) happened in the 1970s, in large part due to the work of [[Phil Seuling]] and his [[Sea Gate Distributors]] company (founded in 1972), as well as a number of individuals, including the Schanes brothers and [[Bud Plant]]. The direct-market went hand-in-hand with the creation of specialist comics shops to cater to the collectors who could then buy [[Comics vocabulary#Back Issue|back issues]] months after a newsstand issue had disappeared. By the late 1970s, thanks partly to the success of films such as ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]'', comics were selling well, and Pacific expanded its distribution system nationwide, raising $200,000 by closing its four San Diego retail locations and selling off inventory, rising rapidly to the top of the new distribution system.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

In the six years between 1974 and 1980, comic or fantasy-related specialty shops rose from numbering 200-300 to around 1500, while Pacific was operating out of a {{convert|2200|sqft|m2|adj=on}} office-warehouse in [[Kearny Mesa]], with 500 wholesale accounts. According to elder brother Steve, the company "grossed just under a million dollars that year," soon doubling its floorspace.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

=== Publishing ===
In 1979, Pacific dipped its feet into publishing when they released ''Warriors of Shadow Realm'', a [[John Buscema]] portfolio of six signed, colored plates&lt;ref&gt;[http://mike.jersey.free.fr/Buscema.htm "The John Buscema Checklist", by Michel Maillot]&lt;/ref&gt; meant to accompany a [[Doug Moench]] and Buscema three-issue [[Weirdworld]] epic-fantasy tale which ran in ''[[Marvel Comics Super Special]]'' #11-13 (June-Oct. 1979).

In 1981, rival distributor [[Capital City Distribution|Capital City]] launched a black-and-white title, ''[[Nexus (comics)|Nexus]]'',&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt; and distributed it through their own system. The Schanes brothers took note, and decided to follow suit, even though they were still paying off debt from a $300,000 bank loan taken out in 1979 at 25 percent interest. Steve — who, with a degree in sculpture had a background in art — handled negotiations with creators, while Bill took on the business and accounting end. The brothers turned to [[Jack Kirby]]. Steve Schanes recalled, "I figured if you want to get people's attention with a new comic book, who better to do it with than the King of Comics, Jack Kirby! We were already friends with Jack. We used to send him free copies of comics he'd drawn for other publishers because they never sent him any! So I just went ahead and called him on the phone, and he turned out to be a nice guy, completely accessible. . . . We negotiated a whole detailed publishing deal between the two of us. No middlemen."&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

The Schaneses asked Kirby, who had effectively quit comics in 1977, for only the publishing rights, assuring him that he could keep full ownership and copyrights, and said they would even help him license characters for use overseas or in other media. Thus, Pacific claims to have become the first company to pay royalty payments to Kirby.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt; Kirby provided Pacific with ''[[Captain Victory and the Galactic Rangers]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Jack Kirby Returns to Comics with Cosmic Hero," ''The Comics Journal'' #65 (Aug. 1981), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; which was published bimonthly from August 1981. Though the Schaneses anticipated sales of less than 25,000, the first issue sold 110,000 copies.&lt;ref name="DAK54"&gt;{{cite news | first = Mark | last = Borax | date = January 1988 | title = Steve Schanes (part 1) | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 54 | pages = 33–39 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirby then let Pacific publish his ''[[Silver Star (comics)|Silver Star]]'', and the brothers decided to start a line of full-color mainstream comic books.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

Before long, Pacific had attracted interest from other comics professionals, including [[Mike Grell]] (who recalls that he was actually the first to sign with Pacific by a couple of weeks, but that Kirby's work was published first because he "delivered his first."&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;) who had planned his ''[[Starslayer]]'' to appear from DC, but after it dropped from the schedule, the Schaneses approached him about publishing it.

Another invitee was then-aspiring artist [[Dave Stevens]], who purchased comics from Pacific's shops and had met the brothers at the [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in 1981. When ''Starslayer'' #2 came up short a few pages, Stevens was approached to fill in the remaining pages, and ultimately came up with ''[[The Rocketeer]]''.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

=== Experimentation and expansion ===
In 1983 Pacific upgraded to paper with higher quality ink.&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Pacific Upgrades All Titles to White paper," ''The Comics Journal'' #84 (September 1983), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Pacific's innovations in creator-owned properties and high-quality printings were soon imitated by industry leaders [[DC Comics]] and [[Marvel Comics]].&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

Pacific continued to distribute and publish comics, running both operations from a San Diego warehouse to which they'd moved in July 1982. They also purchased a firehouse in [[Steeleville, Illinois]] and converted it into a distribution hub. It was also operating warehouses in L.A. and Phoenix at the time. Printing about 500,000 comic books every month, the Schanses employed around forty people at their San Diego operation alone, and were grossing over $3.5 million per annum.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

The brothers hired their father, Steven E. Schanes, as financial vice president and their mother (Christine Marra) as office manager. Elder brother Paul "Pablo" worked in the financial records department, and sister Chris, an L.A.-based attorney, provided counsel on legal affairs.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

=== Later output ===
Pacific's published output contained editorials by [[David Scroggy]], who had started as a comics retailer in 1975, and risen to general manager of Pacific's four San Diego shops by the late 1970s. He helped to bring the reclusive [[Steve Ditko]] to Pacific.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

Ditko's Pacific offering ''[[Missing Man]]'' was previewed in ''Captain Victory'' #6, and then featured in issues of ''Pacific Presents''. His work was scripted by [[Mark Evanier]]. Meanwhile, Pacific published a magazine-sized black-and-white reprint of [[Rog-2000|Rog 2000]] stories that [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] had done in the '70s for [[Charlton Comics]], as well as a number of titles under its parent company '''Blue Dolphin Enterprises.'''&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt; It also welcomed [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]] to the company, and [[Sergio Aragonés]] and [[Mark Evanier]]'s ''[[Groo the Wanderer]]''.

===3-D, Elric, and falling sales===
By 1984, Steve Schanes decided to bring back [[Stereoscopy|3-D]] to comics, a fleeting trend in the 1950s that had then been stymied by poor printing separations. [[Ray Zone]] was hired to do the production, after he had successfully converted a Kirby image for [[Honeycomb (cereal)|Honeycomb cereal]]. Steve Schanes decided the 3-D book would be ''[[Alien Worlds|Alien Worlds 3-D]]'', featuring the first published work of [[Art Adams]], alongside [[John Bolton (comics)|John Bolton]], [[Bill Wray]] and others. Sales on the expensively-produced comic, however, were poor, and sales all round were following suit. One-shots became more common, and tolerable sales on ''[[Elric (comics)|Elric of Melniboné]]'' stumbled when [[First Comics]] acquired the rights, putting Pacific in the awkward position of continuing as distributor on a comic from a rival publisher that they had helped promote.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

=== Competition and collapse ===
After organizational difficulties pushed back the release of ''Starslayer'' by several months, Mike Grell decided to take his creator-owned property to [[First Comics]], and a domino effect began to occur as the loss of a high-profile title to a rival publisher engendered bad industry PR, leading other creators to lose faith in Pacific.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

More importantly, the distribution arm of Pacific was suffering serious problems, due in part to overly-generous credit extensions to retailers, which were not paid back as quickly as expected. Thus, Steve Schanes explained:
{{quote|Most of our comic books still made money hand over fist, but there was a big problem in distribution. We extended too much credit to retailers who didn't pay us on a timely basis, and we were already working on a minuscule profit margin, maybe five percent to eight percent. We didn't push hard enough to get the money from receivables, who owed us hundreds of thousands of dollars. If you had to boil down the single biggest reason we blew it, that would be our poor cash management on the distribution side.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;}}

Pacific's publication arm was also attracting competitors, and Pacific found itself distributing competitors' (including [[Kitchen Sink Press]], [[Last Gasp]] and [[Rip Off Press]]) titles. With this in mind, other publishers (including Capital City (whose ''Nexus'' comic outsold several Pacific titles), [[Comico: The Comic Company|Comico]], [[Aardvark-Vanaheim]], [[Educomics]], [[Quality Comics|Quality]], [[Eagle Comics|Eagle]], [[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse]], [[First Comics|First]], [[Vortex Comics|Vortex]], [[New Media]], [[Fantagraphics]], [[Mirage Comics|Mirage]]) feared that having Pacific, a rival publisher, as their distributor could result in their being cut off from comic shops. This likely played a factor in the multiple alternate distributors who came into being to compete with Pacific, until nearly a quarter of Pacific's comic-shop accounts defected to alternate distributors in 1984, skipping out on paying Pacific for upwards of three months' worth of comic books.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

At the same time, Pacific and parent company Blue Dolphin Enterprises found themselves the target of lawsuits, including some dealing with foreign rights and royalties for Pacific-published creator-owned titles. In August 1984, with the company $740,000 in debt,&lt;ref name="SDBJ"&gt;[http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/print/7448279.html "Comics publisher pins stellar hopes to ''Moonwalker''."] ''San Diego Business Journal'' (March 6, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; the Schaneses informed their staff that they would all be out of work by September.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Pacific Suspends Operations," ''The Comics Journal'' #93 (September 1984), pp. 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Steve Schanes, Pacific's publishing arm was still seeing profit at the time of the closure, but it was outweighed by the losses of the distribution arm, and he and his brother lacked the business expertise to sell off part of the business.&lt;ref name="DAK54"/&gt;

=== Liquidation ===
After the 1984 collapse of Pacific, many of its creator-owned publications moved to [[Eclipse Comics]]: Bruce Jones' ''[[Twisted Tales]]'', ''Alien Worlds'', and ''Somerset Holmes''; Dave Stevens' ''Rocketeer Special'' and a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] of [[Mark Evanier]]/[[Sergio Aragones]]' ''[[Groo the Wanderer]]''.

As Pacific went into liquidation in September 1984,&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Pacific Comics liquidated," ''The Comics Journal'' #95 (February 1985), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Phil Seuling's distribution company [[Sea Gate Distributors]] also closed down. Pacific's distribution centers and warehouses were purchased by [[Bud Plant, Inc.]], and [[Capital City Distribution]], who also opened an expanded facility in Seagate's old space in Sparta, alongside the comic-book printing plant.&lt;ref name="Sanford"/&gt;

Steve Schanes and his wife, Ann Fera, subsequently founded [[Blackthorne Publishing]],&lt;ref name="DAK54"/&gt; and Bill Schanes found employment with [[Diamond Comic Distributors]].

A '''Panther''' is a creature in ancient legend that resembles a big cat with a multicoloured hide. 

Under [[medieval]] belief, after feasting, the panther will sleep in a cave for a total of three days. After this period ends, the panther roars, in the process emitting a sweet smelling odor. This odor draws in any creatures who smell it (the [[dragon]] being the only creature immune),&lt;ref name="bestiary"/&gt; they are eaten by the panther, and the cycle begins again.

The ancient Greeks believed the panther was one of the favored mounts of the god [[Dionysus]].

Other names for this creature are '''pantera''', '''pantere''', and '''love cervere'''.

Usually depicted as a type of cat, the panther was at times depicted in other forms. It was depicted as a [[donkey]], as a composite creature with a horned head, long neck and a [[horse]]'s body, and as a host of other forms.&lt;ref name="bestiary"/&gt; (The word "panther", in Greek, could be interpreted as "every wild beast", supporting the idea of a composite creature.) This was mostly because those involved did not know what a panther should look like;&lt;ref name="bestiary"/&gt; but, in some instances, this was due to cultural influences. In Germany in particular, the panther is often depicted in heraldry as a creature with four horns, cow's ears and a fiery red tongue. An example of the former is the flag and [[coat of arms]] of the city of [[Cres]], [[Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/hr-ri-cr.html |title=Cres (Town, Primorje-Gorski Kotar County, Croatia) |author=Željko Heimer |date= 2016 |accessdate=2017-11-07 |website=Flags of the World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heraldry==
[[File:PantherHeraldry.gif|150px|thumb|A panther dog cat as described in medieval bestiaries and used in heraldry]]
In [[heraldry]] the panther is commonly used in a form known as the '''Panther Incensed'''. In this form, the panther is depicted with flames coming from its mouth and ears, representing the panther's sweet odour.&lt;ref name="bestiary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestiary.ca/beasts/beast79.htm |title=Panther |website=The Medieval Bestiary |date=2011 |accessdate=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heraldic panther is usually shown with coloured spots (semée of roundels), which are frequently blue and red.  The arms of the [[Worshipful Company of Dyers]], however, have as supporters two panthers "...incensed Gules crowned Or and semée of Roundels Gules, Azure, Vert, Purpure and Sable" (with red flames, a gold crown and red, blue, green, purple and black spots). The panther was used by [[Henry VI of England]] as his [[Heraldic badge|badge]] and by other members of the [[House of Lancaster]]. A panther which is all silver (argent) is seen in the coat of arms of the Austrian province of [[Styria]].

[[File:Meister der Pietà von Avignon 004.jpg|thumb|[[Enguerrand Quarton]]. ''Pietà of Villeneuve-lès-Avignon''. Oil on wood, 163cm x 219cm. [[Musée du Louvre]]]]

'''''Pietà of Villeneuve-lès-Avignon''''' is an oil painting of the mid-15th century that is considered one of the outstanding works of art of the late [[Middle Ages]]. Following its appearance at an exhibition in 1904 its authorship was disputed, though it has since been accepted as the work of [[Enguerrand Quarton]]. It is now in the [[Musée du Louvre]].

The [[Pietà]], where the dead Christ is supported by his grieving mother, is a common theme of late-medieval religious art, but this is one of the most striking depictions, "perhaps the greatest masterpiece produced in France in the 15th century" ([[Edward Lucie-Smith]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lucie-Smith, Edward. ''A Concise History of French Painting'', p. 26, Thames &amp; Hudson, London, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinctive from previous depictions of the subject—which were often characterized by overt displays of grief and trauma—by virtue of its restraint. The composition is stable, with the Virgin's hands together in prayer, rather than clutching the body of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2847602 Denny, Don. Notes on the Avignon Pieta, ''Speculum'', Medieval Academy of America, 1969.]&lt;/ref&gt; The curved back form of Christ's body is highly original, and the stark, motionless dignity of the other figures is very different from Italian or Netherlandish depictions. The style of the painting is unique for its time: the grouping of the figures appears somewhat primitive, yet the conception evidences both great breadth and delicacy, the latter quality especially evident in the specificity of the portraits and the elegant gesture of St. John's hands at Christ's head.{{sfn|Gowing|1987}}

The bare background landscape falls away to a horizon broken by the buildings of [[Jerusalem]], but instead of a sky there is plain gold leaf with stamped and incised [[halo (religious iconography)|haloes]], borders and inscriptions. The [[donor portrait|clerical donor]], portrayed with Netherlandish realism, kneels to the left.  The painting came from [[Villeneuve-lès-Avignon]], just across the [[Rhône River|Rhône]] from [[Avignon]], and is sometimes known as the "Villeneuve Pietà".
It can also be suggested that the buildings depicted on the left background are an imaginary representation of [[Istanbul]] and the church of [[Hagia Sophia]]. The city had fallen to the [[Ottomans]] in 1453, a few years before the estimated creation of the painting and the main subject (Pieta) can be considered as a lament to the fall of the eastern part of Christendom.

Before its widely accepted attribution to Quarton, some art historians thought the painting might be by a Catalan or Portuguese master; it was, according to art historian [[Lawrence Gowing]], "the subject of dispute among protagonists of every school along the seaboard between Lisbon and Messina."{{sfn|Gowing|1987|p=72}} Quarton, known to be working in Avignon by 1447, painted two pictures there in the early 1450s which bear comparison to this painting.{{sfn|Gowing|1987}}

For Gowing,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The agony of the picture is suffered with a rare restraint. No demonstrative expression could match the tragedy of this body, distended as if dreaming. We are in the presence of the simplicity of sorrow. Against the bare skyline, in the gray-gold of the medieval twilight, the scene seems inexpressibly grand.{{sfn|Gowing|1987}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[philosophy]], a '''quality''' is an attribute or a [[Property (philosophy)|property]] characteristic of an [[Object (philosophy)|object]].&lt;ref name="Cargile, 1995"&gt;Cargile, J. (1995). qualities. in Honderich, T. (Ed.) (2005). ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (2nd ed.). Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; In [[contemporary philosophy]] the [[idea]] of qualities, and especially how to distinguish certain kinds of qualities from one another, remains controversial.&lt;ref name="Cargile, 1995"/&gt;

==Background==
{{further|Property (philosophy)}}
[[Aristotle]] analyzed qualities in his [[logic]]al work, the [[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]. To him, qualities are [[hylomorphic]]ally–formal attributes, such as "white" or "grammatical". Categories of ''state'', such as "shod" and "armed" are also non–[[essential property|essential]] qualities ''([[sumbebekos|katà symbebekós]])''.&lt;ref name="MIT_Cat_70"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/categories.1.1.html#70 |author=Edghill, E.M. trans. |title=The Internet Classics Archive – Aristotle ''Categories'' |publisher=MIT |year=2009}} line 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle observed: "one and the selfsame substance, while retaining its identity, is yet capable of admitting contrary qualities. The same individual person is at one time white, at another black, at one time warm, at another cold, at one time good, at another bad. This capacity is found nowhere else... it is the peculiar mark of substance that it should be capable of admitting contrary qualities; for it is by itself changing that it does so".&lt;ref name="MIT_Cat_254"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/categories.1.1.html#254 |author=Edghill, E.M. trans. |title=The Internet Classics Archive – Aristotle ''Categories'' |publisher=MIT |year=2009}} line 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle described four types of qualitative opposites: ''correlatives,'' ''contraries,'' ''privatives'' and ''positives.''&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/categories.3.3.html#254 |author=Edghill, E.M. trans. |title=The Internet Classics Archive – Aristotle ''Categories'' |publisher=MIT |year=2009}} line 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Locke]] presented a distinction between primary and secondary qualities in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''. For Locke, a quality is an [[idea]] of a [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]] or a [[perception]]. Locke further asserts that qualities can be divided in two kinds: primary and secondary qualities. [[Primary qualities]] are [[intrinsic]] to an object—a thing or a person—whereas [[secondary qualities]] are dependent on the interpretation of the subjective mode and the context of appearance.&lt;ref name="Cargile, 1995"/&gt; For example, a [[shadow]] is a secondary quality. It requires a certain [[light]]ing to be applied to an object. For another example, consider the [[mass]] of an object. [[Weight]] is a secondary quality since, as a [[measurement]] of gravitational [[force]], it varies depending on the [[distance]] to, and mass of, very massive objects like the [[Earth]], as described by [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's law]]. It could be thought that mass is intrinsic to an object, and thus a primary quality. In the context of [[Theory of relativity|relativity]], the idea of mass quantifying an amount of [[matter#Relativity|matter]] requires caution. The [[relativistic mass]] varies for variously traveling observers; then there is the idea of rest mass or [[invariant mass]] (the magnitude of the [[Four-momentum|energy-momentum 4-vector]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin F. Taylor|Taylor, Edwin F.]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler, John Archibald]], ''Spacetime Physics'', 2nd edition, 1991, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;), basically a system's relativistic mass in its own [[rest frame]] of reference. (Note, however, that Aristotle drew a distinction between qualification and quantification; a thing's quality can vary in degree).&lt;ref name="studman 2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-categories/#Quality |author=Studtmann,P. |year=2007 |title=Aristotle's Categories |editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=E.N. |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |location=Stanford |quote=[Regarding] ''Habits and Dispositions; Natural Capabilities and Incapabilities; Affective Qualities and Affections;'' and ''Shapes;'' [...] Ackrill finds Aristotle's division of quality at best unmotivated.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only an [[isolated system]]'s invariant [[Mass in general relativity|mass in relativity]] is the same as observed in variously traveling observers' rest frames, and [[Conserved quantity|conserved]] in reactions; moreover, a system's heat, including the energy of its massless particles such as photons, contributes to the system's invariant mass (indeed, otherwise even an isolated system's invariant mass would not be conserved in reactions); even a cloud of photons traveling in different directions has, as a whole, a rest frame and a rest energy equivalent to invariant mass.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin F. Taylor|Taylor, Edwin F.]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler, John Archibald]], ''Spacetime Physics'', 2nd edition, 1991, pp. 226-227 and 232-233.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, to treat rest mass (and by that stroke, rest energy) as an intrinsic quality distinctive of physical matter raises the question of what is to count as physical matter. Little of the invariant mass of a [[hadron]] (for example a [[proton]] or a [[neutron]]) consists in the invariant masses of its component [[quark]]s (in a proton, around 1%) apart from their [[gluon]] [[Quantum field theory|particle field]]s; most of it consists in the [[quantum chromodynamics binding energy]] of the (massless) gluons (see [[Quark#Mass]]).

==Conceptions of quality as metaphysical and ontological==
{{main article|Qualia}}
[[Philosophy]] and [[common sense]] tend to see qualities as [[relate]]d either to [[Subjectivity|subjective]] [[feeling]]s or to [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] [[fact]]s. The qualities of something depends on the criteria being applied to and, from a [[neutrality (philosophy)|neutral point of view]], do not determine its value (the [[philosophical value]] as well as [[economic value]]). Subjectively, something might be [[form of the good|good]] because it is [[utility|useful]], because it is [[Beauty|beautiful]], or simply because it [[existence|exists]]. Determining or finding qualities therefore involves [[understanding]] what is useful, what is beautiful and what exists. Commonly, ''quality'' can mean degree of [[excellence]], as in, "a quality product" or "work of average quality". It can also refer to a property of something such as "the [[addictive]] quality of [[nicotine]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]'', [[Robert M. Pirsig]] examines concepts of quality in [[classicism|classical]] and [[Romanticism|romantic]], seeking a [[Metaphysics of Quality]] and a reconciliation of those views in terms of [[non-dualism|non-dualistic]] [[holism]].

'''Religious views on love''' vary widely between different religions. 

==Specific religious views==

===Bahá'í===
{{Quote box|width=35%|align=right|"Love is the mystery of divine revelations! Love is the effulgent manifestation! Love is the spiritual fulfilment! Love is the light of the Kingdom! Love is the breath of the Holy Spirit inspired into the human spirit! Love is the cause of the manifestation of the Truth (God) in the phenomenal world!. Love is the necessary tie proceeding from the realities of things through divine creation!"|`Abdu'l-Bahá, ''Tablets of `Abdu'l-Bahá'' v3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1909 |title = Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Committee |location = Chicago, USA |pages=524–526 |id =  |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TAB/tab-573.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

[[Bahá'u'lláh]], founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], taught that God created humans due to his love for them, and thus humans should in turn love [[God]]. [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], Bahá'u'lláh's son, wrote that love is the greatest power in the world of existence and the true source of eternal happiness.  The [[Bahá'í teachings]] state that all genuine love is divine, and that love proceeds from God and from humans.  God's love is taught to be part of his own essence, and his love for his creatures gives them their material existence, divine grace and eternal life.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= love |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |pages= 227–228 |isbn= 1-85168-184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahá'í teachings state that human love is directed towards both God and other humans; that the love of God attracts the individual toward God, by purifying the human heart and preparing it for the revelation of divine grace.  Thus through the love of God, humans become transformed and become self-[[sacrifice|sacrificing]]. It is also stated that true love for other humans occurs when people see the beauty of God in other people's [[soul]]s. The Bahá'í teachings state that Bahá'ís should love all humans regardless of religion, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or community, and also should love their enemies.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;

===Buddhist===
In [[Buddhism]], ''[[kāma]]'' is sensuous,  love. The vast majority believe it to be an obstacle on the path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], perceiving it as selfish.

''[[Karuṇā]]'' is compassion and mercy, which reduces the suffering of others. It is complementary to wisdom, and is necessary for enlightenment.

''[[Advesa]]'' and ''[[mettā]]'' are benevolent love. This love is unconditional and requires considerable self-acceptance. This is quite different from common conceptions of love which are often confused with attachment and sexual desire, and can be self-interested. Instead, in Buddhism it refers to detachment and unselfish interest in others' welfare.

The Bodhisattva ideal in Tibetan Buddhism involves the complete renunciation of oneself in order to take on the burden of a suffering world. The strongest motivation one has in order to take the path of the Bodhisattva is the idea of salvation within unselfish love for others.

===Christian===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Theological virtues]] --&gt;
Most Christians also believe that [[God]] is the source and essence of eternal [[Love of God (Christianity)|love]], even if in the [[New Testament]] the expression "God is love" explicitly occurs only twice and in two not too distant verses: [[First Epistle of John|1 John]] {{bibleref2-nb|1 John|4:8,16|NIV}} (NIV).

Most Christians believe that the greatest commandment is "thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment"; in addition to the second, "thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself", these are what [[Jesus Christ]] called the two greatest commandments (see Mark 12:28–34, Luke 10:25–28, Matthew 22:37–39, Matthew 7:12; cf. Deuteronomy 6:5, Deuteronomy 11:13, Deuteronomy 11:22, Leviticus 19:18, Leviticus 19:34). See also [[Ministry of Jesus#General ethics]].

In the [[Gospel of John]], Jesus said: "A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this all men will know that you are my [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]], if you love one another." (NIV, John 13:34–35; cf. John 15:17). Jesus also taught "[[Expounding of the Law#Love for enemies|Love your enemies]]." (Matthew 5:44, Luke 6:27).

|quote="Love is patient; love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres."
|source=[[1 Corinthians]] 13:4–7 (NIV)|}}

The New Testament, which was written in Greek, only used two Greek words for love: ''[[agapē]]'' and ''[[philia]]''. However, there are several [[Greek words for love]].
*''Agapē''. In the New Testament, ''[[agapē]]'' is charitable, selfless, altruistic, and unconditional. It is parental love seen as creating goodness in the world, it is the way God is seen to love humanity, and it is seen as the kind of love that Christians aspire to have for others.
*''Philia''. Also used in the New Testament, ''[[philia]]'' is a human response to something that is found to be delightful.  Also known as "brotherly love".
*''[[Eros (love)|Eros]]'' (sexual love) is never used in the New Testament but is more prominent in the Old Testament.
*''[[Storge]]'' (needy child-to-parent love) only appears in the compound word ''philostorgos'' (Rom 12:10).

[[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] glorifies ''agapē'' in the quote above from [[1 Corinthians]] 13, and as the most important virtue of all: "Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away." (13:8 [[NIV]]).

Christians believe that because of [[God]]'s ''agapē'' for humanity He sacrificed his Son for them. [[John the Apostle]] wrote, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved." ([[Gospel of John|John]] 3:16–17 [[KJV]])

In ''[[Works of Love]]'' (1847), [[Søren Kierkegaard]], a philosopher, claimed that Christianity is unique because love is a ''requirement''.

Regarding love for enemies, Jesus is quoted in the Gospel of Matthew chapter five:

''“You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’  But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven.  He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.  If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?  Are not even the tax collectors doing that?  And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others?  Do not even pagans do that?  Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.”
- Matthew 5: 43-48''

Tertullian wrote regarding love for enemies: ''“Our individual, extraordinary, and perfect goodness consists in loving our enemies.  To love one's friends is common practice, to love one's enemies only among Christians.”''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Swartley | first=Willard M. | title=The Love of Enemy and Nonretaliation in the New Testament, Studies in peace and scripture; (As Scapulam I) cited by Hans Haas, Idee und Ideal de Feindesliebe in der ausserchristlichen Welt (Leipzig: University of Leipzig, 1927). | publisher= Westminster John Knox Press | year= 1992 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qjbYqFHzg_EC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=Our+individual,+extraordinary,+and+perfect+goodness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MFo5tSwfag&amp;sig=cB9PzBTiz9lzkMonKUmtXxpggpc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjc6KLEg9rLAhUUVWMKHRTlCFUQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Our%20individual%2C%20extraordinary%2C%20and%20perfect%20goodness&amp;f=false |page=24 | isbn=9780664253547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson | date= October 2011 |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

First there is a [[Covenant (religion)|covenant]] with Christ. [[King Benjamin]] stated in the [[Book of Mosiah]]:

{{quote|And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.|{{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|5|7}} }}

Then there are the [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] of the gospel. Jesus stated in the Book of Mormon in [[Third Nephi]]:

{{quote|Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day.| {{lds|3 Nephi|3-ne|27|20}} }}

And at last Jesus exhorts us to follow his example:

{{quote|And know ye that ye shall be judges of this people, according to the judgment which I shall give unto you, which shall be just. Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am.| {{lds|3 Nephi|3-ne|27|27}} }}

[[Moroni (Book of Mormon prophet)|Moroni]], the last prophet of the book, wrote about love:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.lds.org/ensign/1988/01/a-book-about-gods-love?lang=eng |title= A Book about God’s Love  |first= Lenet |last= Read |authorlink= Lenet Read | date= January 1988 |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.|{{lds|Moroni|moro|7|47}} }}

===Islam===
{{religious text primary|section|date=June 2012}}
In the Sahih Muslim [[Hadith]], the Prophet Muhammad is reported to have said: “You will not enter paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another.”

Muslims are directed by Allah ('God') in the ways to become close to Him and how to gain His love.

God loves those who:
*do good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|195|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|134|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|148|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|13|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|93|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*are pure and clean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|222|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|9|108|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*are righteous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|76|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|9|4|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|9|7|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|19|96|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*are just and act rightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|42|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|49|9|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|60|8|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*trust Him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|159|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*are patient and persevering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|146|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*love Him and follow the Prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|31|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*fight in His cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|61|4|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qur'an also says that God loved Moses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|20|39|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and God Himself will produce people He will love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|54|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here in this selection of verses we notice again the Arabic preference for the negative to state an opposite. While the following do not state that God hates, it certainly enforces the idea that the love of God is withheld from those who practice certain deeds or are described as manifesting a certain character. Several of the verses are repetitious and so we have the following categories.

God does not love:
*the mua'tadeen, those who overstep boundaries or limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|190|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|87|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|7|55|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the fasideen, those who spread corruption or mischief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|205|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|64|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|28|77|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the kafireen, the unbelievers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|32|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|30|45|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the dalemeen, the wrongdoers or oppressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|57|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|140|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|42|40|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the musarifeen, the wasteful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|6|141|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|7|31|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the proud and boastful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|31|18|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|57|23|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|4|36|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|16|23|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*those who boast in their riches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|28|76|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the treacherous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|8|58|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*those who are given to crime and to evil speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|4|107|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|4|148|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahmadiyya'''

According to the [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi]] Muslims, love of the creatures of God is essential for all Muslims. Ahmadi Muslims express that the Qur'an was sent as a gift to mankind, and its teachings are filled with love, tolerance and respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.alislam.org/topics/reply/Love-for-All-Pamphlet.pdf | title=Love for All Pamphlet| publisher=alislam.org | accessdate=April 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founder of the Ahmadiyya sect in Islam, [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The task for which God has appointed me is that I should remove the malaise that afflicts the relationship between God and His creatures and restore the relationship of love and sincerity between them. Through the proclamation of truth and by putting an end to religious conflicts, I should bring about peace and manifest the Divine verities that have become hidden from the eyes of the world. I am called upon to demonstrate spirituality which lies buried under egoistic darkness. It is for me to demonstrate by practice, and not by words alone, the Divine powers which penetrate into a human being and are manifested through prayer or attention. Above all, it ismy task to re-establish in people’s hearts the eternal plant of the pure and shining Unity of God which is free from every impurity of polytheism, and which has now completely disappeared. All this will be accomplished, not through my power, but through the power of the Almighty God, Who is the God of heaven and earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reviewofreligions.org/10547/the-purpose-of-the-advent-of-the-promised-messiah-2/| title=The Purpose of the Advent of the Promised Messiah | publisher=[[Review of Religions]] | accessdate=April 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Hindu===
In Hinduism ''[[kāma]]'' is pleasurable, personified by the god [[Kama (Hinduism)|Kama]]. For many Hindu schools it is the third end in life.

In contrast to ''kāma'', ''[[prema (love)|prema]]'' or ''prem'' refers to elevated love. Love in Hinduism is sacrament. It preaches that one gives up selfishness in love, not expecting anything in return.

It also believes "God is love". A sacred text named Kanda Guru Kavasa quotes, " Oh holy Great flame, Grant me with love..
You said the spreading love is Para Brahma,
For the thing which is everywhere is only Love,
And Love is the only thing which is like a soul within us,
Love is Kumara, Love is Kanda" Simply means Love is God.


The love of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Avatar|deity]] [[Krishna]] with [[Radha]] and many other [[gopi]]s (milkmaids) of [[Vrindavana]] is highly revered. His amorous dance with the [[gopi]]s became known as the ''[[Rasa lila]]''&lt;ref name="golove"&gt;{{cite book | title=Gopīs' Love for Śrī Kṛṣṇa| last=Hanumanprasad| first=Poddar| year=1941| publisher=Gita Press| location=Gorakhpur}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were romanticised in the poetry of [[Jayadeva]], the author of [[Gita Govinda]]. These became important as part of the development of the Krishna bhakti traditions worshiping [[Radha]] [[Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Jewish===
{{Main|Jewish views on love}}
{{Quote box|
width=35%
|align=right
|quote="And you shall love the &lt;small&gt;[[Tetragrammaton|LORD]]&lt;/small&gt; your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might."
|source=[[Deuteronomy]] 6:5|}}

In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''Ahava'' is the most Commonly used term for both interpersonal love of family and love of God. Other related but dissimilar terms are ''chen'' (grace, good will, kindness) and ''[[chesed]]'' (kindness, love), which basically combines the meaning of "affection" and "compassion" and is sometimes rendered in English as "loving-kindness" or "steadfast love."

As for love between marital partners, this is deemed an essential ingredient to life: "See life with the wife you love" ([[Ecclesiastes]] 9:9). The Biblical book [[Song of Solomon|Song of Songs]] is considered a romantically-phrased metaphor of love between God and his people, but in its plain reading reads like a love song.

===Polytheism===
Different cultures have deified love, typically in both male and female form. Even though in monotheistic religions, the God is considered to represent love, there are often [[angel]]s or similar beings that represent love as well.
* [[Áine]]&amp;nbsp;– goddess of fertility and passionate love in [[Irish mythology]]
* [[Eros]] or [[Cupid]]&amp;nbsp;– god of passionate love in [[Roman mythology]]
* [[Antheia]]&amp;nbsp;– goddess in [[Crete mythology]] of love, flowers, gardens, and marshes
* [[Aonghus]] or ''Aengus''— god of beauty, youth, and sensual love in Irish mythology
* [[Aphrodite]]&amp;nbsp;– goddess of beauty and passionate love in [[Greek mythology]]
* [[Astarte]]&amp;nbsp;– goddess of love in Canaanite mythology

* [[Xochipilli]]&amp;nbsp;– god in [[Aztec mythology]].

===Sikhism===

In [[Sikhism]] Love  means love for the Lord and His creation. This is one of five virtues that is vigorously promoted by the Sikh Gurus. The other four qualities in the arsenal are: ''[[Truth]]'' (Sat), ''[[Contentment]]'' (Santokh), ''[[Compassion]]'' (Daya) and ''[[Humility]]'' (Nimrata). These five qualities are essential to a Sikh and it is their duty to meditate and recite the [[Gurbani]] so that these virtues become a part of their mind set.

This is a very positive and powerful tool in the Sikhs arsenal of virtues. When one's mind is full of love, the person will overlook deficiency in others and accept them wholeheartedly as a product of God. Sikhism asks all believers to take on "god-like" virtues and this perhaps is the most "god-like" characteristic of all. Gurbani tells us that Waheguru is a "loving God", full of compassion and kindness. It is the duty of the Sikh to take on qualities of this nature and to easily forgive; to never hate anyone; to live in His Hukam - "Will" and to practise compassion and humility.

"jin prem keyo tin hee prab paeyo" &amp;nbsp;- "Only those who have love, will attain God" - Guru Gobind Singh Ji.

===Unificationism===

The concept of True Love is the most central part of Unificationist theology.

From "MAPPING KNOWLEDGE: THE UNIFICATION ENCYCLOPEDIA PROJECT" http://www.unification.net/misc/ency.html

"The central value in human life, which we may term "true love," means that which seeks the best for others and the betterment of human life in all its dimensions. True love means living for others, giving without thought of a return. Its source is transcendental, beyond the self; the person who practices true love taps into an inexhaustible reservoir of life. The various philosophies and religions of the world speak of this value with a variety of emphases, aspects, and concepts, such as: compassion, grace, justice, charity, liberation, righteousness, and agape love. While recognizing that certain of these aspects may sometimes be in tension (e.g., the well-known Jewish discussion of the dichotomy between divine justice and divine mercy), we may regard the positive tendency of all of them as aspects of a single divine and universal value. This value, true love, is the aspiration and hope of all human beings and the manifestation of the best in human nature. "

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2092">The '''Royal India Society''' was a 20th-century British [[learned society]] concerned with [[India]].

The society was founded in 1910 by [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]], and others, as the India Society. Sedgwick reports Coomaraswamy's stimulus as follows:

:In 1910 he became involved in a very public controversy, played out in the correspondence columns of The Times and elsewhere, on the status of Indian art. This had started when Sir [[George Birdwood]], while chairing the Indian Section of the annual meeting of the Royal Society of Arts, had announced that there was no “fine art” in India and had somewhat unwisely responded to the suggestion that a particular statue of the Buddha was an example of fine art: “This senseless similitude, in its immemorial fixed pose, is nothing more than an uninspired brazen image. . . . A boiled suet pudding would serve equally well as a symbol of passionless purity and serenity of soul.” This controversy culminated in the foundation of the India Society, later the Royal India Society, to combat the views of the Birdwoods of this world. Coomaraswamy played a major part in this endeavor.

In 1944 the Society was granted permission to become The Royal India Society under the patronage of the Dowager Queen [[Mary of Teck]]. After partition, its name was again changed to the Royal India and Pakistan Society, and then again to the Royal India, Pakistan, and Ceylon Society. In 1966 it merged with the [[East India Association]].

'''Sand Mandala''' ({{bo|t=དཀྱིལ་འཁོར།|w=dkyil 'khor|thdl=kilkhor}}; {{zh|s=沙坛城|p=Shā Tánchéng}}&lt;nowiki/&gt;) is a [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] tradition involving the creation and destruction of [[mandalas]] made from coloured  [[sand]]. A sand [[mandala]] is ritualistically  [[Art destruction|dismantled]] once it has been completed and its accompanying ceremonies and viewing are finished to symbolize the Buddhist doctrinal belief in the transitory nature of material life.
{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
[[File:Amazing sand mandala.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Sand mandala displaying its materials]]

==Materials and construction==
Historically, the mandala was not created with natural, dyed sand, but granules of crushed coloured stone. In modern times, plain white stones are ground down and dyed with opaque inks to achieve the same effect. The monks use a special, extremely dense sand in order to limit interference by things like wind or sneezes.  Before laying down the sand, the monks assigned to the project will draw the geometric measurements associated with the mandala. The sand granules are then applied using small tubes, funnels, and scrapers, called [[chak-pur]], until the desired pattern over-top is achieved. Sand mandalas traditionally take several weeks to build due to the large amount of work involved in laying down the sand in such intricate detail. It is common that a team of monks will work together on the project, creating one section of the diagram at a time, working from the centre outwards.

==Themes==
The [[Kalachakra]] Mandala for instance, contains 722 deities portrayed within the complex structure and geometry of the mandala itself. Other smaller mandalas, like the one attributed to [[Vajrabhairava]] contain significantly fewer deities and require less geometry, but still take several days to complete. Like all mandalas, these are meant as two-dimensional representations of what is supposed to be a three-dimensional environment. Various buildings have been suggested to be three-dimensional mandalas such as: [[Borobodur]] in Java, Indonesia, and [[the Bayon]] in Siem Reap, Cambodia, although no academic consensus on either has yet been reached.

Many sand mandala contain a specific outer locality which is clearly identified as a [[charnel ground]].

The colours for the painting are usually made with naturally coloured sand, crushed gypsum (white), yellow ochre, red sandstone, charcoal, and a mixture of charcoal and gypsum (blue). Mixing red and black can make brown, red and white make pink. Other colouring agents include corn meal, flower pollen, or powdered roots and bark.

==Ritual destruction==
The destruction of a sand mandala is also highly ceremonial. Even the deity syllables are removed in a specific order&lt;ref name=Bryant&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Barry|title=Wheel of Time, The: Visual Scripture of Tibetan Buddhism|origyear=1992|year=2003|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=1559391871 |edition=2nd |author2=Yignyen, Tenzin |author3=Samten, Lobsang |author4=Chogyen, Pema Lobsang |author5=Gyaltsen, Dhondup Lobsang |author6=Lhundup, Jamphel |author7=Migyur, Tenzin |author8=Legdan, Tenzin |author9=Gyaltsen, Lobsang |author10=Kirti Tsenshab |author11=Moldow, Deborah |author12=Durgin, Gregory |chapter=X et. seq.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ༼༢༢༨།༢༢༩༽ --&gt; along with the rest of the geometry until at last the mandala has been dismantled. The sand is collected in a jar which is then wrapped in silk and transported to a river (or any place with moving water), where it is released back into nature. This symbolizes the ephemerality of life and the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3015">The '''Society for Sanity in Art''' was an [[United States|American]] artist's society whose members strongly opposed all forms of [[modern art]], including [[cubism]], [[surrealism]], and [[abstract expressionism]]. In 1939, a western branch of this Society changed its name to the [[Society of Western Artists (1939-Present)|Society of Western Artists]].

== History ==
It was founded in [[Chicago]] in 1936 by [[Josephine Hancock Logan]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and from there it spread all over the country, with major branches in [[Boston]] and [[San Francisco]]. Ms. Logan also published a book entitled ''Sanity in Art'' in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sanity in art|last = Hancock Logan|first = Josephine|publisher = Cornell University|year = 1937|isbn = |location = |pages = |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BG0rGQAACAAJ&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions_r&amp;cad=1_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;span&gt;Branches of the group established themselves all around the United States.&lt;/span&gt;

[[Haig Patigian]] served as president of the group in the 1940s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Margaret Fitzhugh Browne]] founded the Boston branch of the organization, and led it in protesting a 1940 exhibit of paintings by [[Picasso]] at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,789821,00.html?promoid=googlep ''Sane Boston''] (3 June 1940), Time Magazine. Unattributed author.&lt;/ref&gt; A western branch of the Society changed its name to the [[Society of Western Artists (1939-Present)|Society of Western Artists]] in 1939, and remains to this day the largest society of representational artists in the western United States. The San Francisco branch of The Society for Sanity in the Arts sponsored an annual art exhibit-for-sale by its members at the [[California Palace of the Legion of Honor]] at least as late as 1945.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.societyofwesternartists.com/ Website of the Society of Western Artists]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Artists that support the cause of this group included; William Winthrop Ward, Florence Louise Bryant, [[Percy Gray]], Rudolph F. Ingerle, &lt;/span&gt;[[Frank Montague Moore]]&lt;span&gt;, Thomas Hill; Frank C. Peyraud, &lt;/span&gt;[[Theodore Wores]]&lt;span&gt; and [[Chauncey Foster Ryder]].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.askart.com/askart/lists/Art_Definition.aspx?sl=S|title = Art Glossary - Society for Sanity in Art|date = |accessdate = November 6, 2014|website = AskArt|publisher = |last = |first = }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society gave out awards to artists who met its standards of "sanity"; these awards included the [[Logan Medal of the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,757440-1,00.html ''Sanity &amp; Mrs. Logan''] (22 March 1937), Time Magazine.

'''Solomon Feferman''' (December 13, 1928 – July 26, 2016)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.illc.uva.nl/LogicList/newsitem.php?id=7645&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[philosopher]] and [[mathematician]] with works in [[mathematical logic]]. 

==Biography==
Feferman was born in [[The Bronx]] in [[New York City]] from working class parents who had emigrated to the United States after [[World War I]] and had met and married in New York. Neither had any advanced education.  The family moved to Los Angeles, where Feferman graduated from high school at age 16. He received his B.S. from the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1948 and his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1957 from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] under [[Alfred Tarski]],&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=19858}}&lt;/ref&gt; after being drafted from 1953 to 1955. In 1956 he was hired with appointments in the Departments of Mathematics and Philosophy at [[Stanford University]], where later he became the [[Patrick Suppes]] Professor of Humanities and Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20171024072327/http://math.stanford.edu/~feferman&lt;/ref&gt;

Feferman was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1972 and 1986&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/solomon-feferman/&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Schock Prize]] in logic and philosophy in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.stanford.edu/news/2003/june4/feferman-64.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was invited to deliver the [https://math.berkeley.edu/about/events/lectures/tarski Tarski Lectures] in 2006. In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved December 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feferman was the editor-in-chief of the five volumes of ''Collected Works'' of [[Kurt Gödel]] that were published by Oxford University Press between 2001 and 2013.

Together with his wife Anita Burdman Feferman, he wrote a biography of [[Alfred Tarski]]: ''Alfred Tarski: Life and Logic'' in 2004.

He worked on predicative mathematics, and in particular introduced the [[Feferman–Schütte ordinal]] as a measure of the strength of certain predicative systems.

'''Stairwell Theater''' is an [[experimental theatre]] company founded in 2014 and based in [[New York City]].

==Founding and history==
Founded in 2014 by [[London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art|L.A.M.D.A]] graduates, Sam Gibbs and Ellyn Heald, the company staged its first production, ''[[As You Like It]]'', at the [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]] Pagoda and Standard Toykraft, Williamsburg, in May, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bike Rides in Bike Month, and Shakespeare vs. ‘Mad Men’ |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/15/nyregion/bike-rides-in-bike-month-and-shakespeare-vs-mad-men.html |publisher=New York Times |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shows at the Prospect Park Pagoda were free of charge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=As You Like It!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4315">'''Survivance''' is a critical term in [[Native American studies]].

==History==
Survivance was originally a legal term, but fell out of use in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;See OED&lt;/ref&gt; The word was subsequently utilized in the 20th century by francophone Canadians as "[[La Survivance]]," and also employed by the French theorist [[Jacques Derrida]] to denote a spectral existence that would be neither life nor death.&lt;ref&gt;Maurizio Calbi, ''Spectral Shakespeares: Media Adaptations in the Twenty-First Century'' (London: Palgrave, 2013), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
It was first employed in the context of [[Native American Studies]] by the [[Anishinaabe]] cultural theorist [[Gerald Vizenor]], in his book ''[[Manifest Manners]]: Narratives on Postindian Survivance''. There he explains that "Survivance is an active sense of [[Metaphysics of presence|presence]], the continuance of native stories, not a mere reaction, or a survivable name. Native survivance stories are renunciations of dominance, tragedy and victimry".&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Vizenor, ''Manifest Manners: Narratives on Postindian Survivance'' (Lincoln: Nebraska, 1999), p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;  Vizenor makes the term, which is deliberately imprecise, the cornerstone of his analysis of contemporary Native American literature, culture and politics. Several critics (e.g. Alan Velie) have analysed the term as a [[portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of "survival and endurance," and others (e.g. Jace Weaver) have read it as a portmanteau of "survival + resistance," but there does not seem to be any evidence that Vizenor had such a specific combination in mind.  Rather, by changing the suffix from -''al'' to -''ance'', he insists on an active survival, in which contemporary Native American peoples go beyond merely subsisting in the ruins of tribal cultures to actively inheriting and refashioning those cultures for the postmodern age.  The [[Cherokee]]-descent poet [[Diane Glancy]] demonstrates the ways that an imprecise term can inspire creativity by reconfiguring it: "Poetry is rebound. A turn of writing. (Sur)vivance: Sur - a survival outside survival. Vivance - the vitality of it."&lt;ref&gt;Diane Glancy, "The Naked Spot: A Journey toward Survivance", in ''Survivance: Narratives of Native Presence'', ed. Gerald Vizenor (Lincoln: Nebraska UP, 2008), p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vizenor frequently defines "survivance" in opposition to "victimry," as some commentators note.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Alan Velie, "N. Scott Momaday's ''[[House Made of Dawn]] and Myths of the Victim'', in ''The Native American Renaissance: Literary Imagination and Achievement'', ed. A Robert Lee and Alan Velie (Norman: Oklahoma UP, 2014), p. 59-60&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Kroeber]] writes that Vizenor's "work aims to repair a peculiarly vicious consequence of genocidal attacks on native of the Americas: an inducing in them of their destroyers' view that they are mere survivors. By accepting this white definition of themselves as victims, natives complete psychologically the not-quite-entirely-successful physical genocide."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Kroeber, "Why It's a Good Thing Gerald Vizenor is not an Indian," in ''Survivance: Narratives of Native Presence'', ed. Gerald Vizenor (Lincoln: Nebraska UP, 2008), p. 25)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Joe Lockard calls it "the condition of self-reliant or communal survival without the social or personal indulgence of victimization."&lt;ref&gt;Joe Lockard, "Facing the Windiigoo," in ''Survivance: Narratives of Native Presence'', ed. Gerald Vizenor (Lincoln: Nebraska UP, 2008), p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

The word has become a [[term of art]] in contemporary Native American studies, used far beyond the context of Vizenor's own work.  It is now also an interactive video game,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://survivance.org/|title = Survivance|website = Survivance|access-date = 2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used in captions for the [[National Museum of the American Indian]],&lt;ref&gt;Sonya Atalay, "No Sense of the Struggle: Creating a Context for Survivance at the NMAI," ''The American Indian Quarterly'' 30.3&amp;4 (2006) 597-618.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being employed numerous times in titles of books and academic articles.

'''Susanne Katherina Langer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|ŋ|ər}}; ''née'' '''Knauth'''; December 20, 1895 – July 17, 1985) was an American philosopher, writer, and educator and was well known for her theories on the influences of art on the mind. She was one of the first women in American history to achieve an academic career in philosophy and the first woman to be popularly and professionally recognized as an American philosopher. Langer is best known for her 1942 book entitled, ''[[Philosophy in a New Key]]''. In 1960, Langer was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterL.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Born Susanne Katherina Knauth, Langer was raised in Manhattan's West Side in New York. She was the daughter of Antonio Knauth, an attorney, and Else Uhlich, both emigrants of Germany. Though she was American born, Langer's primary language was German, as it was strictly spoken in her household throughout her youth, and her German accent remained her entire life. She was exposed thoroughly to creativity and art, most specifically through music. She was taught to play the cello and the piano, and she continued with the cello for the remainder of her life. As a girl, Langer enjoyed reciting the works of great poets as well as traditional children's rhymes and tales. This sparked her love for reading and writing, and she would often write her own poems and stories to entertain her younger siblings. Her love of nature began during the summers her family spent in their cottage on Lake George. She married William Leonard Langer, a fellow student at Harvard in 1921, and in the same year they took their studies to Vienna, Austria. They had two sons and moved back to Cambridge, Massachusetts before the couple divorced in 1942. She died July 17, 1985.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/16/16-02412.html|title=American National Biography Online: Langer, Susanne K.|website=www.anb.org|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/topelius.htm |title=Susanne Langer |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221075501/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/topelius.htm |archivedate=21 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
Her early education included attendance at [[Veltin School for Girls]], a private school as well as being tutored from home. In 1916, Langer enrolled at Radcliffe College. She earned the bachelor's degree in 1920 and continued with graduate studies in philosophy at Harvard, where she received the master's diploma in 1924 and the doctorate in 1926. She was a tutor in philosophy at Radcliffe from 1927 to 1942. She lectured in philosophy for one year at the University of Delaware and for five years at Columbia University (1945-1950). From 1954 to 1962 she taught at Connecticut College. She also taught philosophy at the University of Michigan, New York University, Northwestern University, Ohio University, Smith College, Vassar College, the University of Washington, and Wellesley College.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Philosophy ==

Susanne Langer's unexplored thesis revolving around the connection of consciousness and aesthetics as well as her unusual use of language in her writing ultimately caused her to be scrutinized by her fellow scholars. However, it led her to further explore the complexity and nature of human consciousness.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Shelley, C 1998, 'Consciousness, Symbols and Aesthetics: A Just-So Story and its Implications in Susanne Langer's 'Mind: An Essay on Human Feeling', ''Philosophical Psychology'', 11, 1, pp. 45-66, Philosopher's Index, EBSCOHost, viewed 4 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Langer's philosophy explored the continuous process of meaning-making in the human mind through the power of “seeing” one thing in terms of another. Langer's first major work is entitled, ''Philosophy in a New Key''. It put forth an idea that has become commonplace today: that there is a basic and pervasive human need to symbolize, to invent meanings, and to invest meanings in one’s world.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Howard Gardner, "Philosophy in a New Key Revisited: An Appreciation of Susanne Langer" ''Art, Mind, and Brain: A Cognitive Approach to Creativity'', New York: Basic Books, pp. 48–54&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with a critique of positivism, the work is a study of human thought progressing from semantic theory through philosophy of music, sketching a theory for all the arts. For Langer, the human mind "is constantly carrying on a process of symbolic transformation of the experiential data that come to it," causing it to be "a veritable fountain of more or less spontaneous ideas".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Susanne Langer's distinction between discursive versus presentational symbols is one of her better known concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, Michael H. G., Geist und Welt – durch die Symbolisierungen der Kunst betrachtet, a review of Susanne K. Langer, Die lebendige Form menschlichen Fühlens und Verstehens (The living form of human feeling and understanding). Munich: Fink, 2000. {{ISBN|3-7705-3462-X}}, IASL Online, retrieved 2010-03-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Discursive symbolization arranges elements (not necessarily words) with stable and context invariant meanings into a new meaning. Presentation symbolization operates independently of elements with fixed and stable meanings. The presentation cannot be comprehended by progressively building up an understanding of its parts in isolation. It must be understood as a whole. For example, an element used in one painting may be used to articulate an entirely different meaning in another. The same principle applies to a note in a musical arrangement—such elements independently have no fixed meaning except in the context of their entire presentation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Lachmann, Rolf (January 1998), From Metaphysics to Art and Back: The Relevance of Susan K. Langer’s Philosophy for Process Metaphysics 26, Process Studies, pp. 107–125&lt;/ref&gt;

Langer believed that symbolism is the central concern of philosophy because it underlies all human knowing and understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, Stephen W.; Foss, Karen A. (2008), ''Theories of Human Communication'' (9th ed.), Belmont, California: The Thomson Wadsworth Corporation, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; As with [[Ernst Cassirer]], Langer believed that what distinguishes humans from animals is the capacity for using symbols. While all animal life is dominated by feeling, human feeling is mediated by conceptions, symbols, and language. Animals respond to signs, but stimulus from a sign is significantly more complex for humans. The perspective also is associated with symbolic communication where animal societies are studied to help understand how symbolic communication affects the conduct of members of a cooperating group.

Langer is one of the earliest philosophers who paid close attention to the concept of the virtual. Inspired by Henri Bergson's notions of matter and memory, she connected art to the concept of the virtual. For her, figuring out the space of an art work by its creator was no less than building a virtual world. She describes virtuality as "the quality of all things that are created to be perceived." For her, the virtual is not only a matter of consciousness, but something external that is created intentionally and existing materially, as a space of contemplation outside of the human mind. Langer sees virtuality as a physical space created by the artist, such as a painting or a building, that is “significant in itself and not as part of the surroundings.” She particularly considers architecture not as the realization of a space for being, but its conceptual translation into virtuality for perceiving: “The architect, in fine, deals with a created space, a virtual entity.” In contrast to Bergson, for Langer, virtuality is tangible and can cause a contemplative interaction between humans and the machine.&lt;ref&gt;Susanne K. Langer, ''Feeling and Form'' (Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1953), 65 and 114–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her later years, Langer came to believe that the decisive task of her work was to construct a science and psychology based theory of the "life of the mind" using process philosophy conventions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Langer's final work, ''Mind: An Essay on Human Feeling'' represents the culmination of her attempt to establish a philosophical and scientific underpinning of aesthetic experience, relying on a three volume survey of a comprehensive set of relevant humanistic and scientific texts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== History of feeling ===
Langer's desire to study the mind and its connections with art was rooted in her theory that works of art are representations of human feeling and expression. This led Langer to construct a biological theory of feeling that explains that "feeling" is an inherently biological concept that can be connected to evolutionary genetics. In her essay, ''Mind'', Langer goes into depth to connect the early evolution of man to how we perceive the mind today. She explains that early organisms underwent refinery through natural selection, in which certain behaviors and functions were shaped in order for them to survive. Langer describes the body's organs to all operate within a specific rhythm, and these rhythms must cooperate with one another to keep the organism alive. This development, Langer explains, was the beginning of the framework for the Central Nervous System, which Langer believed to be the heart of cognitive interactions among humans.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Rhetoric ===
Susanne Langer's work with symbolism and meaning has led to her association with contemporary rhetoric, although her influence in the field is somewhat debated.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Lunsford, Andrea (1995). Reclaiming Rhetoric: Women in the Rhetorical Tradition. Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh Press. pp. 265–284.&lt;/ref&gt; Langer established the use of symbols as the "epistemic unit of community",&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; suggesting that all knowledge in a community is gained and built from shared symbol-systems within a given culture. Langer's concept regarding language and dialogue may be understood to imply that language does not simply communicate, but it produces symbols from which humans then create their own reality.&lt;ref&gt;Innes, Robert (2008). Susanne Langer in Focus: The Symbolic Mind. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Claimed support of this perspective comes from Langer's statement that "language is intrinsic to thinking, imagining, even our ways of perceiving".&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;

According to Arabella Lyon, professor at State University of New York, Langer holds that meaning arises from the relationship between a community, its discourse, and the individual.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Lyon suggests that Langer's work may be viewed as a contradiction to the comparatively traditional theories of Aristotle, by way of Langer's argument that discourse forms through sensory experiences shared between speaker and hearer, rather than through logic as advocated by the philosopher. Langer's epistemic view of symbolism and language, which further examines the motivation of the speaker, the influential aspects of language that affect people, and the relationship between the speaker and the community,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; are often reflected in aspects of modern rhetorical studies.

== Influences ==
[[File:Susanne Langer - Filosofia é a contínua busca de sentidos - mais amplos, claros, negociados, articulados.svg|thumb|Poster with a quotation of Susanne Langer in Portuguese]]
Langer's works were largely influenced by fellow philosophers Ernst Cassirer and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. Whitehead, an English mathematician and philosophy professor, was Langer's professor at Radcliffe. Whitehead introduced Langer to the history of human thought, the origins of the modern world, and contemporary philosophy. He helped shape her perspective on these topics which she presented in her first text, The Practice of Philosophy. Throughout her career, Whitehead continued to influence her understanding of the complicated world of human thought which guided her to pursue a philosophical career.  She shared Whitehead’s belief in going beyond the limitations of scientific research and believed that along with the new-found thinking and ideas that had initiated the modern era in science and philosophy, the opportunity for a rebirth of philosophical creativity would arise. Langer dedicated Philosophy in a New Key, to "Alfred North Whitehead, my great Teacher and Friend."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anthonyflood.com/drydenlangerwhitehead.htm|title=Dryden, "Whitehead’s Influence on Susanne Langer’s Conception of Living Form"|website=www.anthonyflood.com|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susanne Langer's other main influence was the German philosopher Ernst Cassirer. Cassirer was a neo-Kantianist who studied the field of theories of symbolization. Cassirer influenced much of Langer's ides in ''Philosophy in a New Key'', where she stated that the creation of symbols is the essential activity of art, myth, rite, the sciences, mathematics, and philosophy. She stated, "It is a peculiar fact that every major advance in thinking, every epoch-making new insight, springs from a new type of symbolic transformation". She drew from Cassirer's view in her belief that art theory must be independent with a theory of mind.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
Susanne Langer is not an extremely well known philosopher; however, her work has influenced and continues to influence many. As one of the first female philosophers, her work has posed as an inspiration to many fellow women to pursue a future in philosophy and other related fields. Her imaginative views on the connections of art and aesthetics with the human mind were revolutionary during her time and sparked a wide interest in the complexity of human consciousness. Although her work is not often cited by today's philosophers, her theories on presentational symbolic activity are part of the "[[collective unconscious]]" where philosophy and psychology meet anthropology.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

'''Tang dynasty tomb figures''' are pottery figures of people and animals made in the [[Tang dynasty]] of China (618–906) as [[grave good]]s to be placed in tombs.  There was a belief that the figures represented would become available for the service of the deceased in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 24, 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; The figures are made of [[Molding (process)|moulded]] [[earthenware]] with colour generally being added, though often not over the whole figure, or in naturalistic places.  Where the colouring was in paint it has often not survived, but in many cases it was in ''[[sancai]]'' ("three-colour") [[ceramic glaze]], which has generally lasted well.

The figures, called ''mingqui'' in Chinese, were most often of servants, soldiers (in male tombs) and attendants such as dancers and musicians, with many no doubt representing [[courtesan]]s. In burials of people of high rank there may be soldiers and officials as well. The animals are most often horses, but there are surprising numbers of both [[Bactrian camel]]s and their [[Central Asian]] drivers, distinguished by thick beards and hair, and their facial features.  The depictions are [[realism (arts)|realistic]] to a degree unprecedented in [[Chinese art]],&lt;ref&gt;Medley, 78&lt;/ref&gt; and the figures give archaeologists much useful information about life under the Tang.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 80; Medley, 80&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also figures of the imaginary monster "earth spirits" and the fearsome human [[Lokapala]] (or ''tian wang''), both usually in pairs and acting as tomb guardians to repel attacks by both spirits and humans.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 78–79; Tang, 46–63&lt;/ref&gt;   Sets of the twelve imaginary beasts of the [[Chinese Zodiac]] are also found, usually unglazed.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 62; Michaelson, 102–103&lt;/ref&gt;

The figures represent a development of earlier traditions of Chinese tomb figures,&lt;ref&gt;Colburn Clydesdale&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Tang elaborate glazed figures are restricted to north China, very largely to the areas around the capitals.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, 133&lt;/ref&gt; They "virtually disappear" from 755 when the highly disruptive [[An Lushan Rebellion]] began,&lt;ref&gt;Medley, 26&lt;/ref&gt; which probably affected the kilns in [[Henan]] and [[Hebei]] making the pieces as well as their elite clientele.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 81&lt;/ref&gt;  A much diminished tradition continued in later dynasties until the Ming.  The use of ''sancai'' glazing on figures was restricted to the upper classes,&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 78&lt;/ref&gt; and production was controlled by the imperial bureaucracy,&lt;ref&gt;McGregor&lt;/ref&gt; but a single burial of a member of the imperial family might contain many hundreds of figures.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1973), 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context and meaning ==
A thousand years before the Tang figures, the [[Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng]] (d. about 433 BC) contained the bodies of 22 musicians, as well as the instruments they played.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 72&lt;/ref&gt;  Traces of wooden figures wearing textiles are known from similar dates, and the First Emperor's [[Terracotta Army]] is famous;&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 32–42&lt;/ref&gt; his funeral also involved the killing and burial of many servants and animals, including all his childless concubines.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 36&lt;/ref&gt; The excavated [[Han dynasty]] tombs we know about contained bronze or pottery figures of horses,&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 47–48; Watson (1973), 110, 119–120&lt;/ref&gt; and often groups of soldiers, well below life-size, in the tombs of commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 24, 44–46; Watson (1973), 118–119&lt;/ref&gt;  Lower down the social scale, pottery models of houses and animals were very common, and continued into the Tang.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1973), 117, 121; Colburn Clydesdale&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time of the short-lived but effective [[Sui dynasty]] (581–618), the pattern of Tang tomb figures was essentially established, though the [[polychromy]] of ''sancai'' colours did not appear until the Tang.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1973), 136; Tang, 16–22, 46&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Xian 2006 6-5.jpg|thumb|[[Lokapala]] guardian figure]]

The size and number of the figures in a grave depended on the rank of the deceased, as did the number that were glazed.  Servants and farm animals were often glazed, painted or [[slip-painting|slip-painted]] white, or brown in the case of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 78–79; Tang, 46–63&lt;/ref&gt;  The figures were paraded on carts as part of the funeral procession.  They were then lined up outside the tomb before the coffin was taken inside. Once this was in place they were taken inside the tomb and arranged in the tomb, often along the sloping access way to the underground burial chamber, or in an ante-chamber to it.  In large tombs there were niches built into the tomb walls for them to occupy.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recent years most pieces came from excavations that were not done by archaeologists and knowledge of the context of pieces was lacking. The important tomb of the Tang Princess [[Li Xianhui]] (or Yongtai) from 705 was discovered in 1960 in the imperial [[Qianling Mausoleum]] complex, and professionally excavated from 1964, the first of a number of excavations of major tombs, though others have been left deliberately undisturbed.  It had been robbed in the past, probably soon after the burial, and items in precious materials taken, but the thieves had not bothered with the 777 unglazed and painted and around 60 glazed tomb figures (now mostly [[Shaanxi History Museum]]).  These were mostly in "solid ranks" in stepped niches off the long sloping entrance way.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1973), 136–137; on other tombs, Hay, throughout, especially 19–35. His fig. 24 shows a niche as found, with its figures.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grand tombs were conceived as "a personalized paradise mirroring the best aspects of the earthly world", approached by a [[spirit road]] with stone statues, and ministered to by priests in temples and altars around the mound.&lt;ref&gt;Eckfield, "Introduction"&lt;/ref&gt; Underground, they also contained extensive frescos with painted representations of the same types of figure as the pottery, and the images in the two media worked together to recreate a palace geography evoking the residence and lifestyle of the deceased before death.  The entrance ramp recreated the approach to a grand palace, the sections with frescos and figure niches reflecting the various enclosures and courtyards of the sprawling palace complexes of Tang royalty. Niches with horses and grooms were nearer the entrance than those with musicians and court ladies; niches were typically flanked by frescos of attendants in charge of that area.  This was imagined as much from the tomb chamber outwards as from the tomb entrance inwards; despite Chinese concepts of Hell and paradise, the spirit of the deceased was believed to continue to inhabit and roam the tomb, and the intention was to provide suitable facilities of all kinds.&lt;ref&gt;Hay, throughout; Eckfield, throughout, concentrating on the mural programmes&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, within tomb complexes such as the Qianling Mausoleum complex, visits by the deceased to the neighbouring tombs of the imperial family, accompanied by huge processions, were envisaged, and saddled pottery horses stood waiting for the entourage, for visits or hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Hay, 46–49&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of figures varies considerably, from about 10 to 110 centimetres high for a standing human figure, and about 55 to 120 or more for the largest types, the beasts and guardians.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 60; Grove: "Earthenware figures, varying in height from c. 150&amp;nbsp;mm to c. 1.5 m", but 12&amp;nbsp;cm is a common height&lt;/ref&gt;  Different scales of figures were usually mixed within tombs, depending on the status of the people or animals depicted.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 79&lt;/ref&gt; There is some indication that glazed and unglazed figures may have been made at different kilns.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 45&lt;/ref&gt;  The figures are low-fired earthenware, since strength and durability were not required. The clay body fires to a "whitish" colour, except for a smaller group of less fine reddish pieces, normally covered in white [[slip (pottery)|slip]].&lt;ref&gt;Medley, 46, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

The figures are moulded, usually from several pieces, with the head always made separately, and the larger animals in the most parts.  The various pieces were [[luting|luted]] together before firing, with the opportunity taken to vary identical figures by joining the heads at slightly different angles.  The clay was often worked by hand, luting on small extra details and textures, and sometimes working on the surface with tools.  In earlier figures a joint line running up the side of the body can often be seen.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 45–46; Medley, 77–78; Vainker, 80&lt;/ref&gt;  The two types of guardian figures For an unknown reason, the heads of horses either face straight ahead or turn to the left; they  almost never turn to the right.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

When the clay work was complete, a white [[slip (ceramics)|slip]] was applied all over, then any glaze was added to the figure before firing. Smaller figures might have a clear or slightly yellow glaze, and in larger ones the glaze was often kept off the face and hands, which were painted after firing.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 51&lt;/ref&gt;  Sui and early Tang figures, before ''sancai'' was used, normally have the transparent glaze.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 46&lt;/ref&gt;  The application of the coloured glazes can be very variable; in many pieces the colours are carefully applied to different parts of the figures, but in others "they have been splashed on without regard for design or contour".&lt;ref&gt;Medley, 80&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[cobalt]] blue was added to the ''sancai'' palette during the period, and at least one horse is partly coloured blue.&lt;ref&gt;Medley, 80; Vainker, 80, [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=257839&amp;partId=1 British Museum page]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some figures had elements in wood, such as weapons, [[polo]]-sticks, or rope halters for horses and camels, which have not survived.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 87&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style ==
[[File:Cernuschi Museum 20060812 163.jpg|thumb|Group of fashionably-dressed female attendants]]
The best period for the figures lasted only about 50 years, to the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] of 755, a period of innovation, unprecedented realism and an interest in showing [[psychology|psychological types]] in several media for [[Chinese art]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1974), 70–76; McGregor&lt;/ref&gt; The figures share with Buddhist monumental sculpture of the period conventions, derived from further west, that show "appropriate detail of muscle which yet departs from reality at many points". The horse figures reflect the same ideal as seen in contemporary paintings, and it is uncertain in which medium the type first arose.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1974), 75–76, 76 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

With exception of the Zodiac figures, which were also the only type to increase in popularity after the Tang, the figures are "more closely related to the metropolitan and Buddhist attitudes than to the magical aspects of rural beliefs and a pattern of behaviour governed by superstitions or shamanistic beliefs of the local farming communities", which partly accounts for their failure to return after the 750s,&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 62–63, 63 quoted&lt;/ref&gt; along with a preference for new types of grave goods.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 81&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of figures ==
The group of 13 [[Tang dynasty tomb figures of Liu Tingxun]], a general who died in 728, represent a fine group of the usual major figures, all in ''sancai''. There are four tomb guardians, and pairs of officials (these are all on a similar scale), horses and camels, plus three grooms, this group on a considerably smaller scale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=227685&amp;partId=1 BM collection database, see curator's note]; McGregor&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women ===
The earliest figures, from the 7th century, are "rather simple and less well-executed than later ones".&lt;ref&gt;Medley, 77–78&lt;/ref&gt;  The women are tall and slim, whereas by the mid-8th century a plumper figure had become the norm, with faces that are "fat, heavily brooding and vacuous".&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 46–48 (48 quoted); Grove&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that this change in taste was provoked by the famous imperial concubine [[Yang Guifei]], who had a full figure, although it seems to begin by about 725,&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 47; Michaelson, 61–62, 70&lt;/ref&gt; when she was a child.

There may be groups of women as dancers or small seated orchestras of musicians, and some sitting figures appear to be beautifying themselves.  More rarely, there are female riders and [[polo]] players, wearing male dress, which was usual for Tang women when riding, and apparently a fashion in the capital on other occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 49–51; Michaelson, 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;  The period was one of unusual freedom for well-off women in China, and the figures reflect this.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 46–51; Michaelson, 59–60, 70–73, 84&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Men ===
Tang society, at least in [[Chang'an]], the capital,&lt;ref&gt;[[Luoyang]] was capital for 684–705&lt;/ref&gt; was very cosmopolitan, and drew much of its prosperity from the [[Silk Road]].  Foreigners from further west seem to have been common as servants, in particular as grooms for horses and drivers of the camels which were the main form of transport on the overland Silk Road. Tang art liked to depict foreign figures, usually men, with standard characteristics for their faces and dress; [[Persia]]n and [[Sogdia]]n types can be distinguished, both with big bushy beards, and often fierce and vigorous expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 51–56; Michaelson, 79–82, 86–87; Grove&lt;/ref&gt;  Such figures sometimes contain clear elements of [[caricature]].&lt;ref&gt;Medley, 79–80&lt;/ref&gt;

Male figures are often given more varied and active poses, and worked in more detail than those of women, but are harder to date as the changes in women's costume were not matched in male fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 55&lt;/ref&gt; As well as many types of servants there are military officers in armour, officials, and sometimes foreign ambassadors.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 51–55&lt;/ref&gt;  The function of the officials is to present the case for the deceased to the fierce [[Yama (East Asia)|judge of the afterlife]].&lt;ref&gt;McGregor&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Animals ===
[[File:Tang Kamel mit Führer Museum Rietberg RCH 516.jpg|thumb|Loaded camel with rider, in this case Chinese]]
The most common animals, and the most likely to be large and carefully modelled and decorated, are horses and camels.  Both sorts range from animals without harness and saddlery to those with elaborately detailed trappings, and carrying riders or, in the case of camels, heavy loads of goods. At least two famous camels carry a small human orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 58–59; [[:File:Sancai musicians on camel, front.jpg|example]], [[:File:Sancai musicians on camel, side.jpg|another view]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Dogs and farm animals, apart from some bulls at up to about 30&amp;nbsp;cm high, are more likely to be small and unglazed.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with guardian figures and officials, statues of horses are the main type of tomb figure that is also known in other media, such as [[gilt-bronze]] or stone, and some rich tombs also contain such figures in metal.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 57–58; Michaelson, 47–48 for a Han example&lt;/ref&gt;  The camels may sometimes belong to tombs of people rich from trade,&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 58&lt;/ref&gt; but also seem to have been associated with wealth generally.  They are often shown with heads raised and their mouths open, and in the finest models the shaggy areas at the neck and top of the legs are carefully textured in the clay.  The horses are the "[[heavenly horses]]" from [[Ferghana]] in the west, which under the Tang dynasty were more common in China and ceased to be a highly prized rarity.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;  These were also made in pottery under the [[Han dynasty]]; the Tang examples are more realistic,&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 56&lt;/ref&gt; if perhaps less expressive.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Tomb guardians ===
[[File:Zhenmushou 02.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Unglazed face of an earth spirit of the semi-human type]]
Four tomb guardians were standard in rich tombs, typically one at each corner: a pair each of "earth spirits" or ''zhenmushou'', and the ''[[lokapala]]'' or ''zhenmuyong'' warrior guardians.  The figures are typically the largest and most elaborate in a tomb, and must often have been much the most difficult to model and fire. They are more likely to be glazed in ''sancai'', although many very elaborately made examples are not.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 60; Medley, 80&lt;/ref&gt;

The figures may have been believed to protect the living by keeping the spirits of the dead from inappropriately roaming the world outside the tomb, as well as protecting the tomb from intrusions by robbers or spirits;&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1973), 143–144&lt;/ref&gt; the earth spirits were apparently associated with the first role, and the ''lokapala'' with the second.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 60; Medley, 80&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''lokapala'' was also found above ground in Buddhist temples, in stone or wood.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 139–140&lt;/ref&gt; They seem to represent a merger of traditional [[Daoist]] guardians, dating back to the [[Han dynasty]], and the Buddhist ''[[dvarapala]]'' or "Heavenly Kings", of which there were in theory four, though often only two were depicted in other Buddhist cultures.  These too were shown as "a fabulous crested semi-human being with bulging eyes, furiously gaping mouth and massive powerful arms and legs".&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 60, quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas the Indian versions emphasized royal attributes, in China they were "transformed into dynamic idealized generals",&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 139–140, 139 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  with elaborate armour, often with added sprigged reliefs.

In the early part of the Tang their pose was less dramatic, standing with straight legs and holding a weapon (now usually lost) at rest. In the 8th century the elaborarate ''[[contrapposto]]'' poses were developed, typically with one foot higher than the other, as it rests on an animal or dwarfish conquered demon, and one arm held high, brandishing a weapon, while the other is bent and rests on the hip, in a pose combining fierceness and nonchalance.&lt;ref&gt;Grove; Tang, 60; Watson (1973), 143–144&lt;/ref&gt;

The earth spirits are still more fantastic, with animal bodies, often including wings sprouting from the tops of the forelegs. The heads are often different, with one semi-human and another perhaps based on a snarling lion.  Both have "horns and crests like flames or huge cockscombs",&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 60&lt;/ref&gt; typically even larger in the lion-like type, while the semi-human type may have huge wide ears. Often the faces of the lion type are glazed, and the semi-human type not. Although mentioned in literature from the Han onwards, they only appear in art from the 6th century onwards,&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 60&lt;/ref&gt; apparently developing from masks worn in the "devil-clearing ceremony at the New Year.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1973), 144&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also more conventional figures of snarling lions, relatively small and usually in '''[[sancai]]'' glaze.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; Like the sets of zodiac figures, these continued after the Tang, which the elaborate "earth spirits" and ''[[lokapala]]'' did not.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 60–62&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collecting history ==
[[File:ShiErShengXiao Shaanxi History Museum.JPG|thumb|left|A set of [[Chinese Zodiac]] figures]]
Tang figures were not of much interest to traditional Chinese connoisseurs of pottery, and are still relatively little collected by Chinese collectors because they are made specifically for use in burials, and so considered unlucky;&lt;ref&gt;Wang, 74&lt;/ref&gt; however they are popular exhibits in Chinese museums.  They became extremely popular with Western collectors from about the 1910s,&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1974), 74; Wang, 74–75; Reitlinger (1963), 18&lt;/ref&gt; especially figures of horses, partly because they harmonized well with modern Western art and decor.  By 1963, [[Gerald Reitlinger]] could write that "no [[Mayfair]] flat is complete without a T'ang camel".&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger (1963), 18&lt;/ref&gt;  Prices, which peaked at a top level of about £600 a figure in the early 1920s, fell in the 1930s and 40s, but rose sharply in the 1960s, with a record auction price in 1969 of £16,000 for a horse.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger (1963), 310–312; Reitlinger (1970), 429–431&lt;/ref&gt;

From about the late 1990s it was realized that there were large numbers of fakes on the market, and there was also an upsurge in new discoveries as construction in China boomed, and the market was hit by increased supply coinciding with a falling from fashion. For all these reasons, the figures have not shared in the huge increase in Chinese art prices since the 1990s, which has been driven by Chinese collectors.  The record price for a horse remains £3,740,000,&lt;ref&gt;Wang, 75, as of 2012&lt;/ref&gt; from a sale by the [[British Rail Pension Fund]] at [[Sotheby's]] in 1989. In 2002 the dealer who had sold this piece to the pension fund in the 1970s said that he thought that in 2002 it would be "lucky" to reach a price of £1 million.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, 75; [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/items-and-icons-chinese-art-1151571.html "Items and Icons: Chinese art"], ''[[The Independent]]'', 21 March 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Entombment''''' is an unfinished painting of the [[Entombment of Christ|placing of the body of Jesus in the garden tomb]], now generally attributed to the Italian Renaissance master [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]] and dated to around 1500 or 1501. It is in the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] in [[London]], which purchased the work in 1868 from [[Robert Turnbull Macpherson|Robert Macpherson]], a Scottish photographer resident in [[Rome]] who, according to various conflicting accounts,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hirst and Jill Dunkerton, Making and Meaning: the Young Michelangelo, National Gallery Publications, London, 1994 at 131, endnote 11.&lt;/ref&gt; had acquired the painting there some 20 years before. 

==History==
The chronological position of this work has been the source of some dispute, although it is generally considered an early work.&lt;ref&gt;Hirst and Dunkerton, op cit at 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Some authorities believe that it may have been executed by one of Michelangelo's pupils from a drawing by the master or was a direct imitation of his work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buonarroti.eu/sepoltura_di_cristo_sc_7462.htm Sepoltura di Cristo: La tela incompiuta di Michelangelo (''in Italian'')]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to documents discovered in 1981,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hirst, 1981. Michelangelo in Rome: an altar-piece and the'Bacchus', ''The Burlington Magazine'', October 1981:581ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Michelangelo had been commissioned to paint a panel for the church of [[Basilica of Sant'Agostino|Sant'Agostino]] in [[Rome]], but in the end gave back the sum received.  It is probable that this work was the ''Entombment'', which remained unfinished upon Michelangelo's return to [[Florence]].

There is an anecdote that Michelangelo received a letter from his father saying that he should abandon whatever he was doing because a great piece of marble had arrived for him, which would become his [[David (Michelangelo)|''David'']] sculpture.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

==Depiction==
The centre of the panel portrays Christ being carried up a flight of steps to the sepulchre, which was intended to be painted in the blank area at the top right of the work. The bearded older man behind him is probably [[Joseph of Arimathea]], who gave up his tomb for use as Christ's sepulchre.  The long-haired figure on the left is probably [[St. John the Evangelist|Saint John]], wearing a long orange-red gown, with one of the Marys (possibly [[Mary Magdalene]]) kneeling at his feet.

The identity of the two figures on the right is uncertain. Suggested identities for the elongated inner figure range from [[Nicodemus]] to one of the Marys,&lt;ref&gt;Hirst and Dunkerton, op cit at 67.&lt;/ref&gt; while the figure on the far right may be [[Mary Salome]]. The large unfinished area at the bottom right was intended to be used for the kneeling form of the [[Virgin Mary]].

The floating appearance of some of the figures may be partly explained by the fact that the painting is intended to be viewed from below,&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Graham-Dixon, “Anatomy of a Genius”, The Independent, 25 October 1994, http://www.andrewgrahamdixon.com/archive/readArticle/891&lt;/ref&gt; and to the fact that it is unfinished. However, the apparent incongruity of the stance of the bearer on the right remains problematical.&lt;ref&gt;Hirst and Dunkerton, op cit at 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the unfinished parts of the painting, such as the cloak of the missing Virgin, would have required quantities of the expensive lapis lazuli blue. If this was in short supply, it could be that this would have held up completion of the painting, which may explain why it was unfinished.&lt;ref&gt;Hirst and Dunkerton, op cit at 70, 123&lt;/ref&gt; However, even if this were so, it would not explain why the artist could not have completed the many other parts of the painting that did not require any blue.&lt;ref&gt;Philip McCouat, "Michelangelo's disputed ''Entombment''", http://www.artinsociety.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Gouden Bocht on the Herengracht in Amsterdam, Seen from the West''''' is a 1672 painting by the Dutch artist [[Gerrit Berckheyde]] (1638-1698). As its title suggests it shows a section of the [[Herengracht]] canal.

Between 1933 and 1940 it was bought from an art dealer by Jacques Gaudicicker. It was purchased by the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam in 1980 for 310,000 guilders - it is still in the Rijksmuseum collection.

'''''The Man-eaters of Tsavo''''' is a book written by [[John Henry Patterson (author)|John Henry Patterson]] in 1907 that recounts his experiences while overseeing the construction of a [[railroad bridge]] in what would become [[Kenya]]. It is titled after [[Tsavo maneaters|a pair of lions]] which killed his workers, and which he eventually killed.

==Overview==
Following the death of the lions, the book tells of the bridge's completion in spite of additional challenges (such as a fierce flood) as well as many stories concerning local wildlife (including other lions), local tribes, the discovery of the maneaters' cave, and various hunting expeditions.

An [[Addendum|appendix]] contains advice to sportsmen visiting [[British East Africa]]. The book also includes photographs taken by Patterson at the time which include the railway construction; the workers; local tribes; scenery and wildlife; and the man-eaters.

Several publications about and studies of the man-eating lions of Tsavo have been inspired by Patterson's account.  The book has been adapted to film three times: a [[monochrome]], British film of the 1950s, a 1952 [[3-D film]] titled ''[[Bwana Devil]]'', and a 1996 color version called ''[[The Ghost and the Darkness]]'', where [[Val Kilmer]] played the daring engineer who hunts down the lions of Tsavo.

==Historicity of the account of the man-eaters==
The [[Victorian literature|Victorian style]] of the prose may appear today as overwritten.  However, the editor's note to the 1986 reprint claims that the facts suggest that some aspects were actually downplayed, such as the death of Haslem, about which more and grisly facts are known.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, J.H., ''The Man-Eaters of Tsavo'', 1986, New York: St. Martin's Press, {{ISBN|0-312-51010-1}}, editor's note to the reprint edition.&lt;/ref&gt; The book describes attacks by [[Tsavo maneaters|two man-eating lions]] on workers building the [[Uganda Railway]] through [[British East Africa]] in 1898 and how the pair were eventually killed by Patterson. It was remarkable that 135 people were killed by the man-eaters in less than a year before Patterson managed to kill them (although this number is contested but not disproven)&lt;ref name=Borzo&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gnoske, Thomas and Julian Kerbis Peterhans | year = 2003 | title =  Field Museum uncovers evidence behind man-eating; revises legend of its infamous man-eating lions | journal = Journal of East African Natural History | url = http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-01/fm-fmu011303.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Patterson's 1907 book itself states that "between them [the lions] no less than 28 Indian [[coolie]]s [labourers], in addition to scores of unfortunate African natives of whom no official record was kept" were killed. Later accounts exaggerated this number: 135 'Indian and African artisans and labourers' (Patterson, 1925), '135 armed men' (Patterson &amp; Neiburger, 2000) and 140 (Caputo, 2000). IN 2001, Julian Kerbis Peterhans and Tom Gnoske published their definitive paper (Kerbis Peterhans &amp; Gnoske, 2001)3 on man-eating behavior among lions with special reference to the Tsavo situation. They documented (p.7) between 28 and 31 victims.This lesser number was confirmed in Dr. [[Bruce Patterson (scientist)|Bruce Patterson]]'s definitive book ''The Lions of Tsavo: Exploring the Legacy of Africa's Notorious Man-Eaters'' published by McGraw-Hill in 2004. He showed that the greater toll attributed to the lions resulted from a pamphlet written by Col. Patterson in 1925, stating "these two ferocious brutes killed and devoured, under the most appalling circumstances, 135 Indian and African artisans and laborers employed in the construction of the Uganda Railway."&lt;ref&gt;''The man-eating lions of Tsavo''. Zoology: Leaflet 7, Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;

The skins of the lions may be found at the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in Chicago, where Bruce Patterson wrote his book.

==Setting==
The book is set in East Africa. The nearest large city to the man-eater attacks is Mombasa, the largest city then and second largest city now in Kenya. The Tsavo man-eater attacks occurred while working on the [[Uganda Railway]]. The railway reached Lake Victoria at Port Florence, now Kisumu, which at that time was in Uganda territory. It was separate from railway developments elsewhere in East Africa, for instance in German-run Tanganyika.

The railway project was controversial and the British Press referred to it as "The Lunatic Express",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmtbristol.org.uk/2005/10/a_new_dawn_for_the_lunatic_exp.html|title=A new dawn for the Lunatic Express|last=Mathenge|first=Gakuu|date=October 23, 2005|publisher=[[Daily Nation]]|accessdate=2009-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; as critics considered it a waste of funds, while supporters argued it was necessary for transportation of goods.

==Plot==
Colonel John Patterson is to build a bridge in East Africa (later Kenya). While he is working on this, two man-eating lions show up. They will stop at nothing for a bite of human flesh and the first attempts to stalk, capture or keep them out of the camp fail.  They attack the camp hospital and kill a patient.  Even after the hospital is moved, one lion penetrates the thick, thorn fence called a [[Boma (enclosure)|boma]] built to protect it and drags the water carrier away to his death. In the course of hunting these lions, Patterson encounters a red spitting cobra, a rhinoceros, a hippopotamus, a pack of wild dogs, a wildebeest that faked dying, and a herd of zebra, of which he captured six. He also shoots a new type of antelope, [[Common Eland|T. oryx pattersonianus]].   Eventually, the first lion is defeated by baiting it with a tethered donkey while Patterson keeps watch from an elevated stand – though for a few tense moments Patterson himself becomes the hunted.  Patterson and Mahina hunt the second lion on the plains.  When they find and shoot it, the lion charges them and it takes repeated shots to bring it down.

The lions are not the only challenge to completing the bridge project. Tensions between native workers and Sikhs brought in from British East India to work on the project (coolies) threaten to stop the project.  At one point, Patterson meets a danger far greater than the lions – a fierce flood. It wipes out the supply bridges and wraps iron girders around tree trunks like wire. Uprooted tree trunks act like battering rams trying to annihilate the bridge.  But the well-built bridge stays intact. This challenge proves that the year spent working on the bridge has not been wasted.

After Patterson completes the bridge, he learns that a lion has been trying to destroy the train station. When he goes to see, he finds big bloodstains where the lion was trying to slash the roof. There were 3 men in one compartment and an uncertain number of coolies in another. Two of the men had been sleeping on the floor when the lion gained entrance. The lion was on one of the men while trying to attack another. The third man, in an effort to get to the other section, which the coolies had been holding shut with their turbans, leapt onto the lion's back, and tried desperately to get through. The coolies opened the door just wide enough for him to get through, and then tied it shut again. As for the other men, one got carried off and eaten by the lion, while the other man lay very still, probably saving his own life.  Hearing this, Patterson decides to go after this lion, eventually finding it and slaughtering it.

Another close encounter with a lion occurs when a lion is aboard a gharri, a means of transportation in Kenya similar to a small trolley. Another time, on the way back to the train station, Patterson converses with a friend who has never shot a lion. A couple of hundred yards away, Patterson points out a pair of lions and encourages the friend to shoot them. One runs off at the first shot, but he successfully bags the other lion. The end of the book includes a photo of the lion that the friend killed.

When the time comes for Patterson to leave, some of the coolies and the natives want to go with him. However, Patterson knows that they do not have the immune defense system to combat the diseases outside of Africa. So he politely says no and leaves Africa for some years. (He later returns to Africa, but this part of his life is not recorded in this book.)

The '''Trevi Fountain''' ({{lang-it|Fontana di Trevi}}) is a [[fountain]] in the [[Trevi (rione of Rome)|Trevi]] district in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], designed by Italian [[architect]] [[Nicola Salvi]] and completed by Giuseppe Pannini. Standing {{convert|26.3|m}} high and {{convert|49.15|m}} wide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trevi Fountain |work=TreviFountain.net | url=http://www.trevifountain.net/description.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the largest [[Baroque]] fountain in the city and one of the most famous fountains in the world. The fountain has appeared in several notable films, including [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'', the eponymous ''[[Three Coins in the Fountain (1954 film)|Three Coins in the Fountain]]'', ''[[The Lizzie McGuire Movie]]'', ''[[Sabrina Goes to Rome]]'' and ''[[Roman Holiday]]''.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2010/05/18/field-of-dreams-for-sale-top-10-iconic-movie-locations/slide/the-trevi-fountain-la-dolce-vita/|title=Top 10 Iconic Movie Locations|last=Silver|first=Alexandra|date=17 May 2010|publisher=[[Time magazine]]|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History before 1629==

The fountain at the junction of three roads (''tre vie'')&lt;ref&gt;Though other etymologies have been suggested, this is the straightforward modern etymology adopted by Pinto 1986 and others.&lt;/ref&gt; marks the terminal point&lt;ref&gt;The technical Italian term for such a "terminal fountain" is a  ("display"): Peter J. Aicher, "Terminal Display Fountains ("Mostre") and the Aqueducts of Ancient Rome" ''Phoenix'' '''47'''.4 (Winter 1993:339–352).&lt;/ref&gt; of the "modern" [[Acqua Vergine]], the revived [[Aqua Virgo]], one of the [[aqueduct (Roman)|aqueducts]] that supplied water to ancient Rome. In 19 BC, supposedly with the help of a virgin, Roman technicians located a source of pure water some {{convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city. (This scene is presented on the present fountain's façade.) However, the eventual indirect route of the aqueduct made its length some {{convert|22|km|mi|abbr=on}}. This ''Aqua Virgo'' led the water into the Baths of [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]]. It served Rome for more than 400 years.&lt;ref&gt;Pintochs.yes I and II.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commission, construction, and design==
In 1629 [[Pope Urban VIII]], finding the earlier fountain insufficiently dramatic, asked [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] to sketch possible renovations, but the project was abandoned when the pope died. Though Bernini's project was never constructed, there are many Bernini touches in the fountain as it exists today. An early, influential model by [[Pietro da Cortona]], preserved in the [[Albertina, Vienna]], also exists, as do various early 18th century sketches, most unsigned, as well as a project attributed to [[Nicola Michetti]]&lt;ref&gt;John A. Pinto, "An Early Project by Nicola Michetti for the Trevi Fountain" ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''119''' No. 897 (December 1977:853–857).&lt;/ref&gt; one attributed to [[Ferdinando Fuga]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=John |last=Pinto |author2=Elisabeth Kieven |title=An Early Project by Ferdinando Fuga for the Trevi Fountain in Rome|journal=The Burlington Magazine|volume=125|issue=|date=December 1983|pages=746–749, 751}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a French design by [[Edmé Bouchardon]].&lt;ref&gt;Pinto 1986. Bouchardon's drawing is conserved in the Musée Vivènal, Compiègne.&lt;/ref&gt;

Competitions had become popular during the [[Baroque]] era to design buildings, fountains, as well as the [[Spanish Steps]]. In 1730 [[Pope Clement XII]] organized a contest in which [[Nicola Salvi]] initially lost to [[Alessandro Galilei]]&amp;nbsp;– but due to the outcry in Rome over a Florentine having won, Salvi was awarded the commission anyway.&lt;ref name=gross&gt;{{cite book | last =Gross | first =Hanns | title =Rome in the Age of Enlightenment: the Post-Tridentine syndrome and the ancient regime | publisher =Cambridge University Press | year =1990 | location =New York | pages =28| isbn = 0-521-37211-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Work began in 1732.

Salvi died in 1751 with his work half finished, but he had made sure a barber's unsightly sign would not spoil the ensemble, hiding it behind a sculpted vase,&lt;ref name="Delli1975"&gt;{{cite book|last=Delli|first=Sergio|title=Le strade di Roma: una guida alfabetica alla storia, ai segreti, all'arte, al folklore|trans-title=The streets of Rome: an alphabetic guide to history, secrets, art, folklore |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HaXtAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=21 May 2018|year=1975|publisher=Armando|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; called by Romans the ''asso di coppe'', the "Ace of Cups", because of its resemblance to a [[Tarot]] card.&lt;ref name="Andrieux1968"&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrieux|first=Maurice|title=Rome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E5SZAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=21 May 2018|year=1968|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four different sculptors were hired to complete the fountain's decorations: [[Pietro Bracci]] (whose statue of [[Oceanus]] sits in the central niche), [[Filippo della Valle]], Giovanni Grossi, and Andrea Bergondi.&lt;ref name="Minor1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Minor|first=Vernon Hyde|title=Passive Tranquillity: The Sculpture of Filippo Della Valle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uh8LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA252|accessdate=21 May 2018|year=1997|publisher=American Philosophical Society|isbn=9780871698759|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giuseppe Pannini was hired as architect.&lt;ref name="MarderJones2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marder|first1=Tod A.|last2=Jones|first2=Mark Wilson|title=The Pantheon: From Antiquity to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hKNwCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT523|accessdate=21 May 2018|date=17 June 2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781316123232|page=523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trevi Fountain was finished in 1762 by Pannini, who substituted the present allegories for planned sculptures of [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] and [[Trivia (mythology)|Trivia]], the Roman virgin.&lt;ref name="Powell2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Powell|first=Lindsay|title=Marcus Agrippa: Right-hand Man of Caesar Augustus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NkKyBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA198|accessdate=21 May 2018|date=28 February 2015|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=9781473854017|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was officially opened and inaugurated on May 22 by [[Pope Clement XIII]].&lt;ref name="RapaginaMatarazzo2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rapagina|first1=Luigi|last2=Matarazzo|first2=Massimiliano|title=The Trevi Fountain: Digital travel guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kgWSCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT15|accessdate=19 May 2018|date=2016-02-02|publisher=Edizioni Polìmata|isbn=9788896760925|page=15|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the piece is made from [[Travertine]] stone, quarried near [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]], about {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=off}} east of Rome.&lt;ref name="TF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trevifountain.net/curiosities.htm|title=The Trevi Fountain – The most beautiful fountain in the world|accessdate=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
The fountain was refurbished once in 1988 to remove discoloration caused by [[smog]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-03-06/travel/8804050287_1_trevi-fountain-water-flow-scaffolding |title=Trevi Fountain Is To Have A Year-long Restoration |date=1988-03-06 |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=2018-05-21 |language=en |agency=New York Times News Service |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1998; the stonework was scrubbed and all cracks and other areas of deterioration were repaired by skilled artisans, and the fountain was equipped with recirculating pumps.&lt;ref name="Euronews" /&gt;

In January 2013, it was announced that the Italian fashion company [[Fendi]] would sponsor a 20-month, 2.2-million-euro restoration of the fountain; it was to be the most thorough restoration in the fountain's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pullella|first=Philip|title=Rome Trevi Fountain, symbol of Dolce Vita, to get big facelift|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/29/uk-arts-trevi-idUSLNE90S01020130129|accessdate=29 January 2013|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Restoration work began in June 2014 and was completed in November 2015. The fountain was reopened with an official ceremony on the evening of November 3, 2015. The restoration included the installation of more than 100 LED lights to improve the nighttime illumination of the fountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2015/11/03/foto/dopo_il_restauro_firmato_fendi_torna_a_splendere_fontana_di_trevi-126552960/1/#1|title=Torna l'acqua a Fontana di Trevi, dopo il restauro firmato Fendi|date=3 November 2015|work=Roma – La Repubblica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainews.it/dl/rainews/articoli/La-Fontana-di-Trevi-torna-antico-splendore-dopo-il-restauro-289f9352-8f61-4cd4-b0b1-7e4ec5f54a74.html?refresh_ce|title=La Fontana di Trevi torna all'antico splendore dopo il restauro|date=11 March 2015|work=rainews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansa.it/sito/photogallery/primopiano/2015/11/03/fontana-di-trevi-applauso-e-flash-salutano-il-ritorno-dellacqua_47eb8c2e-fa84-432b-b0a6-cfe1f3c5adb6.html|title=La Fontana di Trevi, applauso e flash salutano il ritorno dell'acqua|work=ANSA.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==

The backdrop for the fountain is the [[Palazzo Poli]], given a new façade with a [[giant order]] of [[Corinthian order|Corinthian pilasters]] that link the two main stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://curate.nd.edu/show/xw42n58745j |title=Trevi Fountain: Overall view of fountain with the facade of Palazzo Poli |date=1910-01-01 |website=CurateND |publisher=[[University of Notre Dame]] |access-date=2018-05-20 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Taming of the waters'' is the theme of the gigantic scheme that tumbles forward, mixing water and rockwork, and filling the small square. [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]] guide Oceanus' shell chariot, taming [[hippocamp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-trevi/rome-trevi-fountain-symbol-of-dolce-vita-to-get-big-facelift-idUSBRE90R0X020130128 |title=Rome Trevi Fountain, symbol of Dolce Vita, to get big facelift |last=Pullella |first=Philip |date=2013-01-23 |agency=Reuters |access-date=2018-05-20 |language=en-US |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the centre a robustly-modelled [[triumphal arch]] is superimposed on the palazzo façade. The centre niche or [[exedra]] framing [[Oceanus]] has free-standing columns for maximal light and shade. In the niches flanking Oceanus, ''Abundance'' spills water from her urn and ''Salubrity'' holds a cup from which a snake drinks. Above, [[bas relief]]s illustrate the Roman origin of the aqueducts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/rome/attractions/trevi-fountain/a/poi-sig/389099/359975 |title=Trevi Fountain |website=Lonely Planet |language=en |access-date=2018-05-20 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tritons and horses provide symmetrical balance, with the maximum contrast in their mood and poses{{cn|date=May 2017}} (by 1730, [[rococo]] was already in full bloom in [[France]] and [[Germany]]).

==Coin throwing==
Coins are purportedly meant to be thrown using the right hand over the left shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/rome-trevi-fountain-1-million-euro-city-charities-2016-italy-capital-caritas-reports-a7681646.html |title=Rome’s Trevi Fountain generates €1.4m for city’s charities in 2016, reports Caritas |last=Cox |first=Josie |date=2017-04-13 |work=The Independent |access-date=2018-05-20 |language=en-GB |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the theme of 1954's ''[[Three Coins in the Fountain (1954 film)|Three Coins in the Fountain]]'' and the Academy Award-winning song by that name which introduced the picture.

An estimated 3,000 [[euro]]s are thrown into the fountain each day.&lt;ref name=TreviBBC2006&gt;{{cite news | title=Trevi coins to fund food for poor | date=26 November 2006 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6188052.stm | work =BBC News | accessdate = 18 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, an estimated €1.4 million (US$1.5 million) was thrown into the fountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/rome-s-trevi-fountain-holds-nearly-1-5-million-loose-n745921|title=Rome’s Trevi Fountain Holds Nearly $1.5 Million in Loose Change|date=13 April 2017|publisher=NBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The money has been used to subsidize a supermarket for Rome's needy;&lt;ref name=TreviBBC2006 /&gt; however, there are regular attempts to steal coins from the fountain, even though it is illegal to do so.&lt;ref name=TreviBBC2006 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Trevi coins row re-surfaces | date=8 October 2003 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3175072.stm | work =BBC News | accessdate = 18 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Trevi fountain 'copycat' thieves arrested | date=9 August 2002 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2183210.stm | work =BBC News | accessdate = 18 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
