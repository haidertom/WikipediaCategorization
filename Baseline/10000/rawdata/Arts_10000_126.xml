'''''7000 Oaks{{spaced ndash}} City Forestation Instead of City Administration''''' ({{lang-de|'''7000 Eichen{{spaced ndash}} Stadtverwaldung statt Stadtverwaltung'''}}) is a work of [[land art]] by the [[Germans|German]] artist [[Joseph Beuys]]. It was first publicly presented in 1982 at the [[documenta|documenta 7]].

==The project==
With the help of volunteers, Beuys planted 7,000 [[oak]] trees over several years in [[Kassel]], [[Germany]], each with an accompanying [[basalt]] stone. In response to the extensive urbanization of the setting the work was an long and large-scale artistic and ecological intervention with the goal of enduringly altering the living space of the city. The project, though at first controversial, has become an important part of Kassel's cityscape.

[[File:Eiche und Basaltsäule, Joseph Beuys, Düsseldorf (1).jpg|thumbnail|left|The artwork, circa 2008.]]

The project was of enormous scope, and met with some controversy. While the biggest difficulty of the project was raising the money, the project had its share of opponents. Much of it was political, from the conservative state government dominated by the Christian Democrats. (The mayor of Kassel was a social democrat who stood by Beuys). Some people thought the black stone markers were ugly, even piling pink stones on the sites in 1982 as a prank. Also, a motorcyclist had died as a result of one of the stone markers. However, as more trees were planted people's perception of the project as a parking lot destroyer had met with increasing tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.7000eichen.de/stiftung/nemeczek.html |title=Stiftung 7000 Eichen . Stadtverwaldung statt Verwaltung . Ein Joseph Beuys Projekt |publisher=7000eichen.de |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“I think the tree is an element of regeneration which in itself is a concept of time. The oak is especially so because it is a slowly growing tree with a kind of really solid heart wood. It has always been a form of sculpture, a symbol for this planet ever since the Druids, who are called after the oak. Druid means oak. They used their oaks to define their holy places. I can see such a use for the future.... The tree planting enterprise provides a very simple but radical possibility for this when we start with the seven thousand oaks.” (Joseph Beuys in conversation with Richard Demarco, 1982 )

"The planting of seven thousand oak trees is only a symbolic beginning. Contrary to its initiative, progressive features such a symbolic beginning requires a marker, in this instance a basalt column. Future goals for the project included: a) an ongoing scheme of tree planting to be extended throughout the world as part of a global mission to effect environmental &amp; social change "the purpose of educational activities"; b) a growth of awareness within the urban environment of the human dependence on the larger ecosystem educational outreach ; and c) an ongoing process whereby the society would be activated by means of human creative will social sculpture."

Beuys' art works and performances are not about entertaining and amusing the audience. It is an awakening message from the tradition, a recognition of the whole based upon a new concept of beauty that extends beyond the instant gratification.

"I not only want to stimulate people, I want to provoke them." (Bastian, Heines and Jeannot Simmen, "Interview with Joseph Beuys," in the catalog exhibition, Joseph Beuys, Drawings, Victoria and Albert Museum, Westerham Press, 1983, no folio)

It is a movement from the tradition, the expected, and the established for an inclusive openness. Completed in 1987 by his son, Wenzel, on the first anniversary of his father's death (and included in [[documenta|documenta 8]]), the project is still maintained by the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkerart.org/archive/E/A24315825E9BEAE26130.htm |title=Joseph Beuys and his 7000 Oaks|accessdate=2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legacy ===
Beuys' ''7000 Oaks'' work is an example of the thread that links the [[Situationist International|Situationist International's]] approach to art and its re-creation by new groups continues to evolve through a new generation of socially conscious organizations that merge art, education, and environmental issues in their work. In 2000, the [[Center for Art, Design and Visual Culture]] (out of the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]]) developed the [[Joseph Beuys Sculpture Park]] and Joseph Beuys Tree Partnership and planted over 350 trees in various parks in Baltimore Parks with the help of over 500 volunteers including children from local schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umbc.edu/cadvc/exhibitions/beuys.php |title=CADVC: Exhibitions : Beuys Sculpture Park |publisher=Umbc.edu |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was organized around Beuys' philosophy that ‘everyone can be an artist’ by acknowledging the creativity inherent in volunteers planting trees on their own. The goal of the project was also to “extend the traditional role of the art gallery so the gallery extends out into the city”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJXlZz4vVx4 |title=Joseph Beuys Tree Partnership |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-02-13 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Applied folklore''' is the branch of [[folkloristics]] concerned with the study and use of [[folklore]] and [[traditional]] [[culture|cultural]] materials to address or solve real social problems.  The term was coined in 1939 in a talk by [[folklorist]] [[Benjamin A. Botkin]] who, along with [[Alan Lomax]], became the foremost proponent of this approach over the next thirty years.  Applied folklore is similar in its rationale and approach to [[applied anthropology]] and other [[applied social science]]s, and like these other applied approaches often distinguishes itself from "pure" research, that which has no explicit problem-solving aims.

Botkin's development of the approach emerged from his work on the collecting by the [[Federal Writers' Project]] of [[oral history|oral narratives]] of former [[slaves]], when he worked for the [[Library of Congress]].  He saw the dissemination of these materials as having the potential to improve [[race relations]] in the [[United States]] and to combat prejudice.  The [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition movement]] had similarly used the oral narratives of escaped slaves, such as those collected by [[William Still]] in his ''[[Underground Railroad]] Records'', to draw support for their cause.  Botkin's landmark work, ''[[Lay My Burden Down (book)|Lay My Burden Down]]'' (1945) was the first American book to treat oral [[testimony|testimonies]] as [[historiography|historical]] [[evidence]], and it was another thirty years before this became accepted practice.  Botkin also worked with [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] activist [[Rachel Davis DuBois]] to develop public programs to improve race and [[ethnic]] relations by incorporating cultural practices and materials into neighborhood events, such as [[festivals]] and block parties.  Independent of this, [[Myles Horton]], [[Zilphia Horton]], [[Guy Carawan]], [[Candie Carawan]], and others at the [[Highlander Folk School]] in [[Tennessee]] incorporated [[folk song]] and [[folk dance]] into the training of [[civil rights]] activists, such as [[Rosa Parks]] and [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]].

In the 1960s, other American folklorists began to apply knowledge gained from folkloric sources to address social issues, most notably drawing on [[folk medicine]] in the teaching and practice of [[holistic health|holistic]] and [[cross-cultural]] approaches to [[medicine]] and [[public health]].  Folklorists also began to work as consultants in [[city planning]], [[gerontology]], [[economic development]], [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] [[education]], [[conservation biology|conservation]], and other fields.

'''Boris Efimovich Groys''' (born 19 March 1947) is an [[art critic]], media theorist, and philosopher. He is currently a Global Distinguished Professor of Russian and Slavic Studies at [[New York University]] and Senior Research Fellow at the [[Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design]] in [[Karlsruhe]], [[Germany]]. He has been a professor of [[Aesthetics]], [[Art History]], and [[Media Theory]] at the [[Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design]]/[[Center for Art and Media]] in Karlsruhe and an internationally acclaimed Professor at a number of universities in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]], including the [[University of Pennsylvania]], the [[University of Southern California]] and the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] London.

==Biography==

Groys attended high school in Leningrad (known since 1991 as [[St. Petersburg]]).  From 1965–1971 he studied mathematical logic at the [[St. Petersburg State University|University of Leningrad]], subsequently working as a research fellow at various scientific institutes in [[Leningrad]]. From 1976-1981 he served as a research fellow at the Institute of Structural and Applied [[Linguistics]] at the [[University of Moscow]]. In 1981 he emigrated from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] to the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], where he pursued various scholarships. He earned a Ph.D. in philosophy at the [[University of Münster]], Germany.

During his time in the [[Soviet Union]], Groys participated in the unofficial cultural scenes of Moscow and Leningrad, publishing in ''37'', ''Chasy'', and other [[samizdat]] magazines. In 1979 he published the essay “Moscow Romantic Conceptualism” in the art magazine ''[[A-YA]]'', in which he coined the term applied to the art movement “[[Moscow Conceptualists|Moscow Conceptualism]].”

Groys is a pioneering theorist in reflection on socialist art and [[postmodern art]], without evaluating either. Western thinkers such as [[Clement Greenberg]] had criticized socialist art, especially [[socialist realism]], for being mass art and made it an aesthetic taboo. Groys re-evaluated socialist art production, challenging the norms of aesthetics by pushing a thesis based on [[Walter Benjamin]] in the very interpretation of politics, claiming that [[modernism]] had survived in the "total artwork" ([[Gesamtkunstwerk]]) of [[Stalinism]].&lt;ref&gt;Groys, B. (1992). The total art of Stalinism : avant-garde, aesthetic dictatorship, and beyond. Princeton, N.J. ; Oxford, Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This thesis is charged with having pushed a new generation of thinkers into re-evaluating the Socialist aesthetic heritage (among others Miško Šuvaković, Marina Gržinić, and Ana Peraica) recognized as the discourse of [[post-socialist art]].

Groys is a member of the [[International Association of Art Critics|Association Internationale des Critiques d'Art]] (AICAO), and has served as a fellow of numerous institutions including International Research Center for Cultural Studies (IFK) in Vienna, Austria, [[Harvard Art Museums|Harvard University Art Museum]], and the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. In 2001 he served as Director of the [[Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna]]. From 2003 to 2004 he headed the research program ''Post-Communist Condition''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postcommunist.de/home/index.php?kat%3Dprojekt%26lang%3Den |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322204552/http://www.postcommunist.de/home/index.php?kat=projekt&amp;lang=en |archivedate=2012-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in cooperation with [[Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe]] and the Federal Cultural Foundation of Germany.

'''''Children Playing Before a Statue of [[Hercules]]''''' is a [[2005 in literature|2005]] anthology of [[short stories]] edited by [[David Sedaris]].

Sedaris published this book in order to support [[826NYC]], a nonprofit writing and tutoring center in Brooklyn, New York.

The '''Federal Theatre Project''' ('''FTP'''; 1935–39) was a [[New Deal]] program to fund [[theatre]] and other live artistic performances and entertainment programs in the [[United States]] during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. It was one of five [[Federal Project Number One]] projects sponsored by the [[Works Progress Administration]]. It was created not as a cultural activity but as a relief measure to employ artists, writers, directors and theater workers. It was shaped by national director [[Hallie Flanagan]] into a federation of regional theatres that created relevant art, encouraged experimentation in new forms and techniques, and made it possible for millions of Americans to see live theatre for the first time. The Federal Theatre Project ended when its funding was canceled after strong Congressional objections to the left-wing political tone of a small percentage of its productions.

Part of the Works Progress Administration, the Federal Theatre Project was a New Deal program established August 27, 1935,&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|29}} funded under the [[Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935]]. Of the [[United States Dollar|$]]4.88 billion allocated to the WPA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=14926 |title=Letter on Allocation of Work Relief Funds |last=Roosevelt |first=Franklin D.  |authorlink=Franklin Delano Roosevelt |date=August 26, 1935 |website=The American Presidency Project |publisher=Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley |access-date=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; $27 million was approved for the employment of [[Federal Art Project|artists]], [[Federal Music Project|musicians]], [[Federal Writers' Project|writers]] and actors under the WPA's [[Federal Project Number One]].&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|44}}

Government relief efforts through the [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]] and [[Civil Works Administration]] in the two preceding years were amateur experiments regarded as charity, not a theatre program. The Federal Theatre Project was a new approach to unemployment in the theatre profession. Only those certified as employable could be offered work, and that work was to be within the individual's defined skills and trades.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|15–16}}

"For the first time in the relief experiments of this country the preservation of the skill of the worker, and hence the preservation of his self-respect, became important," wrote [[Hallie Flanagan]], director of the Federal Theatre Project.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|17}} A theater professor at [[Vassar College]] who had studied the operation of government-sponsored theatre abroad for the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]],&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|9}} Flanagan was chosen to head the Federal Theatre Project by WPA head [[Harry Hopkins]],&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|20}} a former classmate at Grinnell College.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|7}} Roosevelt and Hopkins selected her despite considerable pressure to choose someone from the commercial theatre; they believed the project should be led by someone with academic credentials and a national perspective.&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt;{{Rp|39}}

Flanagan was given the daunting task of building a nationwide theater program to employ thousands of unemployed artists in as little time as possible. The problems of the theatre preceded the financial collapse of 1929. By that time it was already threatened with extinction due to the growing popularity of films and radio, but the commercial theatre was reluctant to adapt its practices.&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt;{{Rp|38}} Many actors, technicians and stagehands had suffered since [[1914 in film|1914]], when movies began to replace [[Repertory theatre|stock]], [[vaudeville]] and other live stage performances nationwide. [[Sound film#Triumph of the "talkies"|Sound motion pictures]] displaced 30,000 musicians. In the [[Great Depression]], people who had no money for entertainment found an entire evening of entertainment at the movies for 25 cents, while commercial theatre charged $1.10 to $2.20 admission to cover the cost of theater rental, advertising and fees to performers and union technicians. Unemployed directors, actors, designers, musicians and stagecrew took any kind of work they were able to find, whatever it paid, and charity was often their only recourse.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|13–14}}

"This is a tough job we're asking you to do," Hopkins told Flanagan at their first meeting in May 1935. "I don't know why I still hang on to the idea that unemployed actors get just as hungry as anybody else."&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|7–9}}

Hopkins promised "a free, adult, uncensored theatre"&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|28}} — something Flanagan spent the next four years trying to build.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|29}} She emphasized the development of local and regional theatre, "to lay the foundation for the development of a truly creative theatre in the United States with outstanding producing centers in each of those regions which have common interests as a result of geography, language origins, history, tradition, custom, occupations of the people."&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|22–23}}

==Operation==
On October 24, 1935, Flanagan prefaced her instructions on the Federal Theatre's operation with a statement of purpose:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The primary aim of the Federal Theatre Project is the reemployment of theatre workers now on public relief rolls: actors, directors, playwrights, designers, vaudeville artists, stage technicians, and other workers in the theatre field. The far reaching purpose is the establishment of theatres so vital to community life that they will continue to function after the program of this Federal Project is completed.&lt;ref name="Instructions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=ftscript&amp;fileName=farbf/00010002/ftscript.db&amp;recNum=2 |title=Instructions for Federal Theatre Projects of the Works Progress Administration |last=Flanagan |first=Hallie |date=October 24, 1935 |website=New Deal Stage |publisher=Library of Congress |access-date=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within a year the Federal Theatre Project employed 15,000 men and women,&lt;ref name="Houseman RT"/&gt;{{Rp|174}} paying them $23.86 a week.&lt;ref name="NYT New Deal doc"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dunning |first=Jennifer  |authorlink=Jennifer Dunning |date=July 5, 1981 |title='New Deal' Artists Star in a TV Documentary |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/05/arts/new-deal-artists-star-in-a-tv-documentary.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location= |access-date=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its nearly four years of existence it played to 30 million people in more than 200 theaters nationwide&lt;ref name="Houseman RT"&gt;{{cite book |last=Houseman |first=John |authorlink=John Houseman |title=Run-Through: A Memoir |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=New York |date=1972 |isbn=0-671-21034-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|174}} — renting many that had been shuttered — as well as parks, schools, churches, clubs, factories, hospitals and closed-off streets.&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt;{{Rp|40}} Its productions totalled approximately 1,200, not including its radio programs.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|432}} Because the Federal Theatre was created to employ and train people, not to generate revenue, no provision was made for the receipt of money when the project began. At its conclusion, 65 percent of its productions were still presented free of charge.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|434}} The total cost of the Federal Theatre Project was $46 million.&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=Ronald|date=January 1974|title=The Role of Blacks in the Federal Theatre, 1935–1939|url=|journal=The Journal of Negro History|publisher=|volume=59|issue=1|pages=38–50|jstor=2717139}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|40}}

"In any consideration of the cost of the Federal Theatre," Flanagan wrote, "it should be borne in mind that the funds were allotted, according to the terms of the Relief Act of 1935, to pay wages to unemployed people. Therefore, when Federal Theatre was criticized for spending money, it was criticized for doing what it was set up to do."&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|34–35}}

The Federal Theatre Project established five regional centers in [[New York, New York]], [[Boston]] (Northeast), [[Chicago]] (Midwest), [[Los Angeles]] (West), and [[New Orleans]] (South).&lt;ref&gt;[https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/6858/umi-umd-4347.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y UMD ]- Retrieved 2018-05-02&lt;/ref&gt; The FTP did not operate in every state, since many lacked a sufficient number of unemployed people in the theatre profession.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|434}} The project in Alabama was closed in January 1937 when its personnel were transferred to a new unit in Georgia. Only one event was presented in Arkansas. Units created in Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin were closed in 1936; projects in Indiana, Nebraska, Rhode Island and Texas were discontinued in 1937; and the Iowa project was closed in 1938.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|434–436}}

Many of the notable artists of the time participated in the Federal Theatre Project, including [[Susan Glaspell]] who served as Midwest bureau director.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|266}} The legacy of the Federal Theatre Project can also be found in beginning the careers of a new generation of theater artists. [[Arthur Miller]], [[Orson Welles]], [[John Houseman]], [[Martin Ritt]], [[Elia Kazan]], [[Joseph Losey]], [[Marc Blitzstein]] and [[Abe Feder]] are among those who became established, in part, through their work in the Federal Theatre.  Blitzstein, Houseman, Welles and Feder collaborated on the controversial production, ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]''.

The Federal Theatre Project was the most costly of the Federal One projects, consuming 29.1 percent of Federal One's budget, which was itself less than three-fourths of one percent of the total WPA budget.

On June 30, 1939, the Federal Theatre Project ended when its funding was canceled, largely due to strong Congressional objections to the overtly left-wing political tones of less than 10 percent of the Federal Theatre Project productions.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|361–363}}

==Living Newspaper==
{{main|Living Newspaper}}
[[Living Newspaper]]s were plays written by teams of researchers-turned-playwrights. These men and women clipped articles from newspapers about current events, often hot button issues like [[farm]] policy, [[syphilis]] testing, the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], and housing inequity. These newspaper clippings were adapted into plays intended to inform audiences, often with [[progressivism|progressive]] or left-wing themes. ''Triple-A Plowed Under'', for instance, attacked the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] for killing an aid agency for farmers.  These politically themed plays quickly drew criticism from members of [[United States Congress|Congress]].

Although the undisguised political invective in the Living Newspapers sparked controversy, they also proved popular with audiences.  As an art form, the Living Newspaper is perhaps the Federal Theatre's most well-known work.

Problems with the Federal Theatre Project and Congress intensified when the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] objected to the first Living Newspaper, ''Ethiopia'', about [[Haile Selassie]] and his nation's struggles against [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invading Italian forces]]. The U.S. government soon mandated that the Federal Theatre Project, a government agency, could not depict foreign heads of state on the stage for fear of diplomatic backlash. Playwright and director [[Elmer Rice]], head of the New York office of the FTP, resigned in protest and was succeeded by his assistant, Philip W. Barber.

The Negro Theatre Unit was part of the Federal Theatre Project and had units that were set up in cities throughout the United States. The units were located in four different geographical regions of the country. In the West, units were located in Seattle, Washington, and Los Angeles, California. In the East, units were located in New York City, New York, Boston, Massachusetts, Hartford, Connecticut, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Newark, New Jersey. In the South, there were units in Raleigh, North Carolina, Durham, North Carolina, and Birmingham, Alabama. In the Midwest, units were located in Chicago, Illinois, Peoria, Illinois, and Cleveland, Ohio. The project provided employment and apprenticeships to black playwrights, directors, actors, and technicians. The project offered a much needed source of assistance for African-American theatre from 1935 to 1939. The project's inspiring purposes further influenced the founding within a year of the [[American Negro Theater]], 1940 – 1949.

The Negro Theatre Unit of New York City was the best known. It was headquartered at the [[Lafayette Theatre (Harlem)|Lafayette Theatre]] in Harlem, where some 30 plays were presented. The first was [[Frank H. Wilson]]'s folk drama, ''Walk Together Chillun'' (1936), about the deportation of 100 African-Americans from the South to the North to work for low wages. The second was ''Conjur' Man Dies'' (1936), a comedy-mystery adapted by [[Arna Bontemps]] and [[Countee Cullen]] from [[Rudolph Fisher]]'s novel. The most popular production was the third, which came to be called the ''[[Voodoo Macbeth]]'' (1936), director [[Orson Welles]]'s adaptation of Shakespeare's play set on a mythical island suggesting the Haitian court of King [[Henri Christophe]].&lt;ref name="A to Z"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hill |first=Anthony D.  |date=2009 |title=The A to Z of African American Theater|url= |location=Lanham |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishing Group |isbn=9780810870611}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|179–180}}

==Radio==
The Federal Theatre of the Air began weekly broadcasts March 15, 1936. For three years the radio division of the Federal Theatre Project presented an average of 3,000 programs annually on commercial stations and the NBC, Mutual and CBS networks. The major programs originated in New York; radio divisions were also created in 11 states.&lt;ref name="Arena"&gt;{{cite book |last=Flanagan |first=Hallie  |authorlink=Hallie Flanagan |date=1965 |title=Arena: The History of the Federal Theatre |url= |location=New York |publisher=Benjamin Blom, reprint edition [1940] |oclc=855945294}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|267–268, 397}}

Series included ''Professional Parade'', hosted by [[Fred Niblo]]; ''Experiments in Symphonic Drama'', original stories written for classical music; ''Gilbert and Sullivan Light Opera'', the complete works performed by Federal Theatre actors and recordings by [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company|D'Oyly Carte]]; ''Ibsen's Plays'', performances of 12 major plays; ''Repertory Theatre of the Air'', presenting literary classics; ''Contemporary Theatre'', presenting plays by modern authors; and the interview program, ''Exploring the Arts and Sciences''.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|268}}

The radio division presented a wide range of programs on health and safety, art, music and history. The American Legion sponsored [[James Truslow Adams]]'s ''Epic of America''. The children's program, ''Once Upon a Time'', and [[Paul de Kruif]]'s ''Men Against Death'' were both honored by the National Committee for Education by Radio. In March 1939, at the invitation of the BBC, Flanagan broadcast the story of the Federal Theatre Project to Britain. Asked to expand the program to encompass the entire WPA, the radio division produced ''No Help Wanted'', a dramatization by [[William N. Robson]] with music by [[Leith Stevens]]. ''[[The Times]]'' called it "the best broadcast ever sent us from the Americas".&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|268–269}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radiogoldindex.com/cgi-local/p2.cgi?ProgramName=No%20Help%20Wanted |title=No Help Wanted  |publisher=RadioGOLDINdex |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productions criticized by Congress==
A total of 81 of the Federal Theatre Project's 830 major titles were criticized by members of Congress for their content in public statements, committee hearings, on the floor of the Senate or House, or in testimony before Congressional committees. Only 29 were original productions of the Federal Theatre Project. The others included 32 revivals or stock productions; seven plays that were initiated by community groups; five that were never produced by the project; two works of Americana; two classics; one children's play; one Italian translation; and one Yiddish play.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|432–433}}

The Living Newspapers that drew criticism were ''Injunction Granted'', a history of American labor relations; ''[[One-Third of a Nation]]'', about housing conditions in New York; ''Power'',&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}} about energy from the consumer's point of view;&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|184–185}} and ''Triple A Plowed Under'', on farming problems in America.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}} Another that was criticized, on the history of medicine, was not completed.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|434}}

Dramas criticized by Congress were ''American Holiday'', about a small-town murder trial; ''Around the Corner'', a Depression-era comedy; ''Chalk Dust'', about an urban high school; ''Class of '29'', the Depression years as seen through young college graduates; ''Created Equal'', a review of American life since colonial times; ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]'s parable of democracy and dictatorship; ''No More Peace'', [[Ernst Toller]]'s satire on dictatorships; ''Professor Mamlock'', about Nazi persecution of Jews; ''Prologue to Glory'', about the early life of Abraham Lincoln; ''The Sun and I'', about [[Joseph (patriarch)|Joseph]] in Egypt; and ''Woman of Destiny'', about a female President who works for peace.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}}

Negro Theatre Unit productions that drew criticism were ''The Case of Philip Lawrence'', a portrait of life in Harlem; ''Did Adam Sin?'', a review of black folklore with music; and ''Haiti'', a play about [[Toussaint Louverture]].&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}}

Also criticized for their content were the dance dramas ''Candide'', from Voltaire; ''How Long Brethren'', featuring songs by future [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] recipient [[Lawrence Gellert]]; and ''Trojan Incident'', a translation of Euripides with a prologue from Homer.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}}

''Help Yourself'', a satire on high-pressure business tactics, was among the comedies criticized by Congress. Others were ''Machine Age'', about mass production; ''On the Rocks'' by [[George Bernard Shaw]]; and ''The Tailor Becomes a Storekeeper''.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}}

Children's plays singled out were ''Mother Goose Goes to Town'', and ''[[Revolt of the Beavers]]'', which the ''[[New York Journal-American|New York American]]'' called a "pleasing fantasy for children".&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}}

The musical ''Sing for Your Supper'' also met with Congressional criticism, although its patriotic finale, "[[Ballad for Americans]]", was chosen as the theme song of the 1940 Republican National Convention.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}}

The '''Flag of Kirkcudbrightshire''' is the flag of the [[Kirkcudbrightshire|county and stewartry of Kirkcudbright]].&lt;ref&gt;[{{Flag Institute|Kirkcudbrightshire}} The Flag Institute].&lt;/ref&gt; It was registered with the Flag Institute as the flag of the county in June 2016 after the Lord Lieutenant petitioned the [[Lord Lyon]].

==Design==
The green and white emblem represents the checked cloth used to count taxes by the Stewards of the [[Lord of Galloway|Lords of Galloway]] with the [[Cuthbert|St Cuthbert]]'s cross sitting on top. The town and county of Kirkcudbright were named after the saint, with an early rendition of the name being Kilcudbrit, derived from the Scots Gaelic ''Cille Chuithbeirt'' (Chapel of Cuthbert). The Anglo-Saxon saint's remains were kept here for seven years between exhumation at [[Lindisfarne]] and re-interment at [[Chester-le-Street]]. A pectoral cross was found on the saint’s body when his tomb was opened in the nineteenth century. The original is on display in [[Durham Cathedral]] where he was eventually buried. That cross is also depicted on the [[flag of County Durham]].

'''Folklore studies''', also known as '''folkloristics''', and occasionally '''tradition studies''' or '''folk life studies''' in Britain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=England, National Folklore Survey|journal=Folklore|volume=127|issue=3|pages=257–269|doi=10.1080/0015587X.2016.1198178|year = 2016|last1 = Widdowson|first1 = J. D. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the formal academic discipline devoted to the study of [[folklore]]. This term, along with its synonyms,&lt;ref group=note&gt;According to Alan Dundes, this term was first introduced in an address by [[Charles Leland]] in 1889. He spoke in German to the Hungarian Folklore Society and referenced "Die Folkloristik". {{harv|Dundes|2005|page=386}} In contemporary scholarship, the word ''Folkloristics'' is favored by Alan Dundes, and used in the title of his publication {{harv|Dundes|1978}}. The term ''Folklore Studies'' is defined and used by [[Simon Bronner]], see {{harv|Bronner|1986|page=xi}}.&lt;/ref&gt; gained currency in the 1950s to distinguish the academic study of traditional culture from the [[cultural artifact|folklore artifacts]] themselves. It became established as a field across both Europe and North America, coordinating with ''Volkskunde'' (German), ''folkermimne'' (Norwegian), and ''folkminnen'' (Swedish), among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Brunvald|1996|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The importance of folklore and folklore studies was recognized globally 1982 in the [[UNESCO]] document "Recommendation on the Safeguarding of Traditional Culture and Folklore".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13141&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=UNESCO Recommendation 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UNESCO again in 2003 published a [[Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage]]. Parallel to these global statements, the American Folklife Preservation Act (P.L. 94-201),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/folklife/public_law.html | title=Public Law 94-201 (The Creation of the American Folklife Center, Library of Congress)}}&lt;/ref&gt; passed by the [[United States Congress]] in conjunction with the Bicentennial Celebration in 1976, included a definition of folklore, also called [[folklife]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...[Folklife] means the traditional expressive culture shared within the various groups in the United States: familial, ethnic, occupational, religious, regional; expressive culture includes a wide range of creative and symbolic forms such as custom, belief, technical skill, language, literature, art, architecture, music, play, dance, drama, ritual, pageantry, handicraft; these expressions are mainly learned orally, by imitation, or in performance, and are generally maintained without benefit of formal instruction or institutional direction." &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This law was added to the panoply of other legislation designed to protect the natural and cultural heritage of the United States. It gives voice to a growing understanding that the cultural diversity of the United States is a national strength and a resource worthy of protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hufford|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To fully understand the term ''folklore studies'', it is necessary to clarify its component parts: the terms '''folk''' and '''lore'''. Originally the word ''folk'' applied only to rural, frequently poor, frequently illiterate peasants. A more contemporary definition of ''folk'' is a social group which includes two or more persons with common traits, who express their shared identity through distinctive traditions. "Folk is a flexible concept which can refer to a nation as in [[Folklore of the United States|American folklore]] or to a [[Family folklore|single family.]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{harv |Dundes|1969|page=13|footnote=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expanded social definition of ''folk'' supports a wider view of the material considered to be ''folklore artifacts''. These now include "things people make with words (verbal lore), things they make with their hands (material lore), and things they make with their actions (customary lore)".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Wilson|2006|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The folklorist studies the [[traditional]] artifacts of a group. They study the groups, within which these customs, traditions and beliefs are transmitted.

'''Transmission''' of these artifacts is a vital part of the folklore process. Without communicating these beliefs and customs within the group over space and time, they would become cultural shards relegated to cultural archaeologists. These [[Cultural artifacts|folk artifacts]] continue to be passed along informally within the group, as a rule anonymously and always in multiple variants. For the folk group is not individualistic, it is community-based and nurtures its lore in community. This is in direct contrast to [[high culture]], where any single work of a named artist is protected by copyright law.

The folklorist strives to understand the '''significance''' of these beliefs, customs and objects for the group. For "folklore ''means'' something -- to the tale teller, to the song singer, to the fiddler, and to the audience or addressees".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dundes|2007a|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cultural units&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dundes|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;  would not be passed along unless they had some continued relevance within the group. That meaning can however shift and morph. So [[Halloween]] of the 21st century is not the All Hallows' Eve of the Middle Ages, and even gives rise to its own set of  [[Poisoned candy myths|urban legends]] independent of the historical celebration. The cleansing rituals of Orthodox Judaism were originally good public health in a land with little water; now these customs signify identification as an Orthodox Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Georges|1995|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With an increasingly theoretical sophistication of the social sciences, it has become evident that folklore is a naturally occurring and necessary component of any social group, it is indeed all around us.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not have to be old or antiquated. It continues to be created, transmitted and in any group can be used to differentiate between "us" and "them". All cultures have their own unique folklore, and each culture has to develop and refine the techniques and methods of folklore studies most effective in identifying and researching their own. As an academic discipline, folklore studies straddles the space between the Social Sciences and the Humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hufford|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not always the case. The study of folklore originated in Europe in the first half of the 19th century with a focus on the oral folklore of the rural peasant populations. The "[[Kinder- und Hausmärchen]]" of the [[Brothers Grimm]] (first published 1812) is the best known but by no means only collection of verbal folklore of the European peasantry. This interest in stories, sayings and songs, i.e. verbal lore, continued throughout the 19th century and aligned the fledgling discipline of folklore studies with Literature and Mythology. By the turn into the 20th century, European folklorists remained focused on the oral folklore of the homogeneous peasant populations in their regions, while the American folklorists, led by [[Franz Boas]], chose to consider [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures in their research, and included the totality of their customs and beliefs as folklore. This distinction aligned American folklore studies with cultural anthropology and ethnology, using the same techniques of data collection in their field research. This divided alliance of folklore studies between the humanities and the social sciences offers a wealth of theoretical vantage points and research tools to the field of folklore studies as a whole, even as it continues to be a point of discussion within the field itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Zumwalt|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public folklore]] is a relatively new offshoot of folklore studies; it started after the Second World War and modeled itself on the seminal work of [[Alan Lomax]] and [[Ben Botkin]] in the 1930s which emphasized [[applied folklore]]. Public sector folklorists work to document, preserve and present the beliefs and customs of diverse cultural groups in their region. These positions are often affiliated with museums, libraries, arts organizations, public schools, historical societies, etc. The most renowned of these is the [[American Folklife Center]] at the Smithsonian, together with its [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] held every summer in Washington, DC. Public folklore differentiates itself from the academic folklore supported by universities, in which collection, research and analysis are primary goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hufford|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The terms '''folklore studies''' and '''folklore''' belong to a large and confusing word family. We have already used the synonym pairs '''Folkloristics / Folklife Studies''' and '''folklore / folklife''', all of them in current usage within the field. ''Folklore'' was the original term used in this discipline. Its synonym, ''folklife'', came into circulation in the second half of the 20th century, at a time when some researchers felt that the term ''folklore'' was too closely tied exclusively to oral lore. The new term ''folklife'', along with its synonym ''folk culture'', is meant to categorically include all aspects of a culture, not just the oral traditions. [[Folk process]] is used to describe the refinement and creative change of artifacts by community members within the folk tradition that defines the folk process.&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{cite book | title=Story/telling | publisher=Univ. Queensland Press | author1=Levy, Bronwen Ann|author2=Murphy, Ffion  | year=1991 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=5Rhqzx0oPOgC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=%22folk+process%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22folk%20process%22&amp;f=false | page=43| isbn=9780702232022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Professionals within this field, regardless of the other words they use, consider themselves to be '''folklorists'''.

Other terms which might be confused with folklore are [[popular culture]] and [[Vernacular culture]], both of which vary from folklore in distinctive ways. '''Pop culture''' tends to be in demand for a limited time; it is generally mass-produced and communicated using mass media. Individually, these tend to be labeled [[fads]], and disappear as quickly as they appear. The term '''vernacular culture''' differs from folklore in its overriding emphasis on a specific locality or region. For example, [[vernacular architecture]] denotes the standard building form of a region, using the materials available and designed to address functional needs of the local economy. ''Folk architecture'' is a subset of this, in which the construction is not done by a professional architect or builder, but by an individual putting up a needed structure in the local style. In a broader sense, all folklore is vernacular, i.e. tied to a region, whereas not everything vernacular is necessarily folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also further cognates used in connection with folklore studies. '''Folklorism''' refers to "material or stylistic elements of folklore [presented] in a context which is foreign to the original tradition." This definition, offered by the folklorist Hermann Bausinger, does not discount the validity of meaning expressed in these "second hand" traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Smidchens|1999|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Walt Disney films and products belong in this category of folklorism; the fairy tales, originally told around a winter fire, have become animated film characters, stuffed animals and bed linens. Their meaning, however far removed from the original story telling tradition, does not detract from the importance and meaning they have for their young audience. '''[[Fakelore]]''' refers to artifacts which might be termed ''pseudo-folklore''; these are manufactured items claiming to be traditional. The folklorist [[Richard Dorson]] coined this word, clarifying it in his book "Folklore and Fakelore".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorson|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current thinking within the discipline is that this term places undue emphasis on the origination of the artifact as a sign of authenticity of the tradition. The adjective '''folkloric''' is used to designate materials having the character of folklore or tradition, at the same time making no claim to authenticity.

==Methodology==
There are several goals of active folklore research. The first objective is to identity tradition bearers within a social group and to collect their lore, preferably in situ. Once collected, these data need to be documented and preserved to enable further access and study. The documented lore is then available to be analyzed and interpreted by folklorists and other cultural historians, and can become the basis for studies of either individual customs or comparative studies. There are multiple venues, be they museums, journals or folk festivals to present the research results. The final step in this methodology involves advocating for these groups in their distinctiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Wilson|2006|pages=81–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific tools needed by folklorists to do their research are manifold. 
* The researchers must be comfortable in '''fieldwork'''; going out to meet their informants where they live, work, and perform. 
* They need to access '''archives''' housing a vast array of unpublished folklore collections. 
* They will want work with '''folk museums''', to both view the collections, and present their own findings. 
* '''Bibliographies''' maintained by libraries and on line contain an important trove of articles from around the world. 
* The use of '''indexes''' allow them to view and use the categorization of artifacts which have already been established. 
* All work by a folklorist must be appropriately '''annotated''' in order to provide identifiable sources of the work. 
* For all folklorists '''terminology''' becomes a skill to master as they rub elbows not only with related academic fields but also with the colloquial understanding (what exactly is a fairy tale?). This shared vocabulary, with varying and sometimes divergent shades of meaning, needs to be used thoughtfully and consistently. 
* The use of '''printed sources''' to locate and identify further variants of a folk tradition is a necessary adjunct to the field research. 
* Because the transmission of folk artifacts preceded and ignored the establishment of national and political boundaries, it is important to cultivate '''international connections''' to folklorists in neighboring countries and around the world to compare both the artifacts researched and the methodology used. 
* A knowledge of the '''history of folklore studies''' is called for to identify the direction and more importantly the biases which the field has taken in the past, enabling us to temper the current analysis with more impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorson|1972|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;In a more dramatic and less technical approach, Henry Glassie describes the tools of the folklore trade: "[Folklorists were the] hunters and gatherers of academe…still rooting about in reality, hunting down and gathering up facts that we brought back alive. In those days [the 1960s] … we were delighted to be allowed to enter the university, set up camp, and practice our humble, archaic trade. They had let us in and we honored the established disciplines around us by stealing all we could. While the more advanced people around us slept, we slid in the shadows past their fires, rifled their baggage, stole their books, learned their language, and came to be able to ape their culture in a way that we at least found convincing. In our excitement we did not stop to ponder whether their theories sorted well with our traditional preoccupations. We learned the schemes of those we perceived to be higher in the academic hierarchy than ourselves, then applied those schemes to our own topics. We felt mature.{{harv|Glassie|1983|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The folklorist also rubs shoulders with researchers, tools and inquiries of neighboring fields:  literature, anthropology, cultural history, linguistics, geography, musicology, sociology, psychology. This is just a partial list of the fields of study related to folklore studies, all of which are united by a common interest in subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bauman|Paredes|1972|page=xx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===From antiquities to lore===
It is well-documented that the term "folklore" was coined in 1846 by the Englishman [[William Thoms]]. He fabricated it for use in an article published in the August 22, 1846 issue of [[The Athenaeum (British magazine)|''The Athenaeum'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Georges|1995|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thoms consciously replaced the contemporary terminology of   "popular antiquities" or "popular literature" with this new word. Folklore was to  emphasize the study of a specific subset of the population: the rural, mostly illiterate peasantry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his published call for help in documenting antiquities, Thoms was echoing scholars from across the European continent to collect artifacts of older, mostly oral cultural traditions still flourishing among the rural populace. In Germany the [[Brothers Grimm]] had first published their "[[Kinder- und Hausmärchen]]" in 1812. They continued throughout their lives to collect [[Volkskunde|German folk tales]] to include in their collection. In [[Danish folklore#History|Scandinavia]], intellectuals were also searching for their authentic [[Teutons|Teutonic roots]] and had labeled their studies ''Folkeminde'' (Danish) or ''Folkermimne'' (Norwegian).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout Europe and America, other early collectors of folklore were at work. [[Thomas Crofton Croker]] published fairy tales from southern Ireland and, together with his wife, documented [[keening]] and other Irish funereal customs. [[Elias Lönnrot]] is best known for his collection of epic Finnish poems published under the title [[Kalevala]]. [[John Fanning Watson]] in the United States published the "Annals of Philadelphia".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/annalsofphiladel01wats | title=Annals of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania, in the olden time; being a collection of memoirs, anecdotes, and incidents of the city and its inhabitants, and of the earliest settlements of the inland part of Pennsylvania, from the days of the founders ... Embellished with engravings| publisher=[Philadelphia] The author| date=1850-1860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With increasing industrialization, urbanization, and the rise in literacy throughout Europe in the 19th century, folklorists were concerned that the oral knowledge and beliefs, the [[Oral traditions|lore]] of the rural folk would be lost. It  was posited that the stories, beliefs and customs were surviving fragments of a cultural mythology of the region, pre-dating Christianity and rooted in pagan peoples and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This thinking goes in lockstep with the rise of [[nationalism]] across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Georges|1995|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some British folklorists,{{which|date=August 2018}} rather than lamenting or attempting to preserve rural or pre-industrial cultures, saw their work as a means of furthering industrialization, scientific rationalism, and [[disenchantment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Josephson-Storm|2017|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the need to collect these vestiges of rural traditions became more compelling, the need to formalize this new field of cultural studies became apparent. The British ''[[Folklore Society]]'' was established in 1878 and the ''[[American Folklore Society]]'' was established a decade later. These were just two of a plethora of academic societies founded in the latter half of the 19th century by educated members of the emerging middle class.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bronner|1986|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; For literate, urban intellectuals and students of folklore the '''folk''' was someone else and the '''past''' was recognized as being something truly different.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Georges|1995|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folklore became a measure of the [[Social progress|progress of society]], how far we had moved forward into the industrial present and indeed removed ourselves from a past marked by poverty, illiteracy and superstition. The task of both the professional folklorist and the amateur at the turn of the 20th  century was to collect and classify cultural artifacts from the pre-industrial rural areas, parallel to the drive in the life sciences to do the same for the natural world.&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859.&lt;/ref&gt; "Folk was a clear label to set materials apart from modern life…material specimens, which were meant to be classified in the natural history of civilization. Tales, originally dynamic and fluid, were given stability and concreteness by means of the printed page."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bronner|1986|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viewed as fragments from a pre-literate culture, these stories and objects were collected without context to be displayed and studied in museums and anthologies, just as bones and potsherds were gathered for the life sciences. [[Kaarle Krohn]] and [[Antti Aarne]] were active collectors of folk poetry in Finland. The Scotsman [[Andrew Lang]] is known for his 25 volumes of [[fairy tales|Andrew Lang's Fairy Books]] from around the world. [[Francis James Child]] was an American academic who collected English and Scottish popular ballads and their American variants, published as the [[Child Ballads]]. In the United States, both [[Mark Twain]] and [[Washington Irving]] drew on folklore to write their stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bronner|1986|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bronner|1986|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; One [[Samuel Clemens]] was also a charter member of the American Folklore Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dundes|2005|page=402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aarne–Thompson and the historic-geographic method===
By the beginning of the 20th century these collections had grown to include artifacts from around the world and across several centuries. A system to organize and categorize them became necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv| Georges|1995|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antti Aarne published a first classification system for folktales in 1910. It was later expanded into the [[Aarne–Thompson classification system]] by [[Stith Thompson]] and remains the standard classification system for European folktales and other types of oral literature. As the number of classified artifacts grew, similarities were noted in items which had been collected from very different geographic regions, ethnic groups and epochs.

In an effort to understand and explain the similarities found in tales from different locations, the Finnish folklorists Julius and Kaarle Krohne developed the [[Julius Krohn#Scientific work|Historical-Geographical method]], also called the Finnish method.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Wolf-Knuts|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using multiple variants of a tale, this investigative method attempted to work backwards in time and location to compile the original version from what they considered the incomplete fragments still in existence. This was the search for the "Urform,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which by definition was more complete and more "authentic" then the newer, more scattered versions. The historic-geographic method has been succinctly described as a "quantitative mining of the resulting archive, and extraction of distribution patterns in time and space". It is based on the assumption that every text artifact is a variant of the original text. As a proponent of this method, [[Walter Anderson (folklorist)|Walter Anderson]] proposed additionally a '''Law of Self-Correction''', i.e. a feedback mechanism which would keep the variants closer to the original form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Anderson is best known for his monograph ''[[King John and the Bishop|Kaiser und Abt]]'' (Folklore Fellows' Communications 42, Helsinki 1923) on folktales of type AT 922.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during the first decades of the 20th century that Folklore Studies in Europe and America began to diverge. The Europeans continued with their emphasis on oral traditions of the pre-literate peasant, and remained connected to literary scholarship within the universities. By this definition, folklore was completely based in the European cultural sphere; any social group that did not originate in Europe was to be studied by [[Ethnology|ethnologists]] and [[cultural anthropologists]]. In this light, some twenty-first century scholars have interpreted European folkloristics as an instrument of [[internal colonialism]], in parallel with the imperialistic dimensions of early 20th century cultural anthropology and [[Orientalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Josephson-Storm|2017|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike contemporary anthropology, however, many early European folklorists were themselves members of the prioritized groups that folkloristics was intended to study; for instance, Andrew Lang and [[James George Frazer]] were both themselves Scotsmen and studied rural folktales from towns near where they grew up.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Josephson-Storm|2017|pages=128–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to this, American folklorists, under the influence of the German-American [[Franz Boas]] and [[Ruth Benedict]], sought to incorporate other cultural groups living in their region into the study of folklore. This included not only customs brought over by northern European immigrants, but also African Americans, [[Acadians]] of eastern Canada, [[Cajuns]] of Louisiana, [[Hispanics]] of the American southwest, and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. Not only were these distinct cultural groups all living in the same regions, but their proximity to each other caused their traditions and customs to intermingle. The lore of these distinct social groups, all of them Americans, was considered the bailiwick of American folklorists, and aligned American folklore studies more with ethnology than with literary studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Zumwalt|1988|pages=16–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Depression and the Federal Writers' Project===
Then came the 1930s and the worldwide [[Great Depression]]. In the United States the [[Federal Writers' Project]] was established as part of the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]]. Its goal was to offer paid employment to thousands of unemployed writers by engaging them in various cultural projects around the country. These white collar workers were sent out as field workers to collect the oral folklore of their regions, including stories, songs, idioms and dialects. The most famous of these collections is the [[Slave Narrative Collection]]. The folklore collected under the auspices of the Federal Writers Project during these years continues to offer a goldmine of primary source materials for folklorists and other cultural historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|pages=10, 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As chairman of the Federal Writers' Project between 1938 and 1942, [[Benjamin A. Botkin]] supervised the work of these folklore field workers. Both Botkin and [[John Lomax]] were particularly influential during this time in expanding folklore collection techniques to include more detailing of the interview context.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a significant move away from viewing the collected artifacts as isolated fragments, broken remnants of an incomplete pre-historic whole. Using these new interviewing techniques, the collected lore became embedded in and imbued with meaning within the framework of its contemporary practice. The emphasis moved from the lore to the folk, i.e. the groups and the people who gave this lore meaning within contemporary daily living.

===German Folklore in the Third Reich ===
In Europe during these same decades, folklore studies were drifting in a different direction. Throughout the 19th century folklore had been naively tied to romantic ideals of the soul of the people, in which folk tales and folksongs recounted the lives and exploits of ethnic folk heroes. Folklore chronicled the mythical origins of different peoples across Europe and established the beginnings of national pride (read: [[nationalism]]). By the first decade of the 20th century there were scholarly societies as well as individual folklore positions within universities, academies and museums, however the study of German Volkskunde had yet to be defined as an academic discipline. 

In the 1920s this originally innocent movement was usurped by nationalistic political forces in several European countries, first and foremost in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorson|1972|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bendix|1998|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this decade that an unfortunate congruence with national socialist ideology was seen to take place; the vocabulary of German Volkskunde, words such as Volk (folk), Rasse (race), Stamm (tribe) and Erbe (heritage) mapped neatly into the political dogmas of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi]] party. The expressed goal of the National Socialists was to re-establish the purity of the Germanic, i.e. Nordic, tribes in Europe. The German philosopher [[Ernst Bloch]] was one of the main apologists for this ideology.&lt;ref group=note&gt;In his study ''Erbschaft dieser Zeit'' (1935) (translation ''Heritage of Our Times'', Polity, 1991) Ernst Bloch examined how the more mythological way of scholarly thought of the 19th century was revived by the National Socialists.&lt;/ref&gt; “Nazi ideology presented racial purity as the means to heal the wounds of the suffering German state following World War I. Hitler painted the ethnic heterogeneity of Germany as a major reason for the country’s economic and political weakness, and he promised to restore a German realm based on a cleansed, and hence strong, German people. Racial or ethnic purity” was the goal of the Nazis, intent on forging a [[Greater Germanic Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bendix|1997|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the decades immediately following the Second World War, departments of Folklore were being established in multiple German universities. However an analysis of just what part folklore studies played in justifying and supporting the criminal abuses during the Third Reich did not begin until 20 years after World War II in West Germany. The scholarship, in particular the works of Hermann Bausinger and Wolfgang Emmerich in the 1960s, pointed out that the vocabulary current in Volkskunde was ideally suited for the kind of ideology that the National Socialists had built up.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lixfeld|Dow|1994|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then another 20 years before convening the 1986 Munich conference on Folklore and National Socialism. This continues to be a difficult and painful discussion within the German folklore community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lixfeld|Dow|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After World War II===
Following World War II, the discussion continued about whether to align folklore studies with literature or ethnology. Within this discussion, many voices were actively trying to identify the optimal approach to take in the analysis of folklore artifacts. One major change had already been initiated by Franz Boas. Culture was no longer viewed in evolutionary terms; each culture has its own integrity and completeness, and was not progressing either toward wholeness or toward fragmentation. Individual artifacts must have meaning within the culture and for individuals themselves in order to assume [[Cultural relativism|cultural relevance]] and assure continued transmission. Because the European folklore movement had been primarily oriented toward oral traditions, a new term, [[folklife]], was introduced to represent the full range of traditional culture. This included [[music]], [[dance]], [[storytelling]], [[crafts]], [[costume]], [[foodways]] and more.

Folklore became more than just stuff, it became a verb. Folklore was the event of doing within a given context, for a specific audience, using artifacts as necessary props in the communication of traditions between individuals and within groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bauman|1972|page=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1970s, these new areas of folklore studies became articulated in [[performance studies]], where traditional behaviors are evaluated and understood within the context of their performance. It is the meaning within the social group that becomes the focus for these folklorists, foremost among them [[Richard Bauman]]n&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Baumann|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Kirshenblatt-Gimblett|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enclosing any performance is a framework which signals that the following is something outside of ordinary communication. For example, [[Joke#Telling jokes|"So, have you heard the one…"]] automatically flags the following as a joke. A performance can take place either within a cultural group, re-iterating and re-enforcing the customs and beliefs of the group. Or it can be performance for an outside group, in which the first goal is to set the performers apart from the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Baumann|1971|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This analysis then goes beyond the artifact itself, be it dance, music or story-telling. It goes beyond the performers and their message. As part of performance studies, the audience becomes part of the performance. If any folklore performance strays too far from audience expectations, it will likely be brought back by means of a negative feedback loop at the next iteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both performer and audience are acting within the "Twin Laws" of [[Folk process|folklore transmission]], in which novelty and innovation is balanced by the conservative forces of the familiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Toelken|1996|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even further, the presence of a [[Participant observation#Impact of researcher involvement|folklore observer]] at a performance of any kind will influence the performance itself in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. Because folklore is firstly an act of communication between parties, it is incomplete without inclusion of the reception in its analysis. The understanding of folklore performance as communication leads directly into [[Linguistics#Anthropology|modern linguistic theory]] and [[communication studies]]. Words both reflect and shape our worldview. Oral traditions, particularly in their stability over generations and even centuries, provide significant insight into the ways in which insiders of a culture see, understand, and express their responses to the world around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Toelken|1996|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;In his chapter "Folklore and Cultural Worldview", Toelken provides an illuminating comparison of the worldview of European Americans with Navajos. In the use of language, the two cultural groups express widely differing understandings of their spatial and temporal place in the universe.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three major approaches to folklore interpretation were developed during the second half of the 20th century. [[Structuralism#Structuralism in anthropology|Structuralism]] in folklore studies attempts to define the structures underlying oral and customary folklore.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, a [[joke]] uses words within a specific and well-defined narrative structure to make people laugh. A [[fable]] uses anthropomorphized animals and natural features to illustrate a moral lesson, frequently concluding with a moral. These are just a few of the many formulaic structures used in oral traditions.&lt;/ref&gt; Once classified, it was easy for structural folklorists to lose sight of the overarching issue: what are the characteristics which keep a form constant and relevant over multiple generations? [[Structural functionalism|Functionalism]] in folklore studies also came to the fore following World War II; as spokesman, [[William Bascom]] formulated the [[William Bascom#Four functions of folklore|4 functions of folklore]]. This approach takes a more top-down approach to understand how a specific form fits into and expresses meaning within the culture as a whole.&lt;ref group=note&gt;An example of this are the [[Joke#Joke cycles|joke cycles]] that spontaneously appear in response to a national or world tragedy or disaster.&lt;/ref&gt; A third method of folklore analysis, popular in the late 20th century, is the [[Psychoanalytic theory|Psychoanalytic]] Interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|page=187ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; championed by [[Alan Dundes]]. His monographs, including a study of homoerotic subtext in American football&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dundes|1978|title=Into the Endzone for a Touchdown}}&lt;/ref&gt; and anal-erotic elements in German folklore,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dundes|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; were not always appreciated and involved Dundes in several major folklore studies [[Alan Dundes#Controversy|controversies]] during his career. True to each of these approaches, and any others one might want to employ (political, women's issues, material culture, urban contexts, non-verbal text, ad infinitum), whichever perspective is chosen will spotlight some features and leave other characteristics in the shadows.

With the passage in 1976 of the American Folklife Preservation Act, folklore studies in the United States came of age. This legislation follows in the footsteps of other legislation designed to safeguard more tangible aspects of our [[Cultural Heritage|national heritage]] worthy of protection. This law also marks a shift in our national awareness; it gives voice to the national understanding that diversity within the country is a unifying feature, not something that separates us.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://folkways.si.edu/mission-history/smithsonian | title=Mission and History}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We no longer view cultural difference as a problem to be solved, but as a tremendous opportunity. In the diversity of American folklife we find a marketplace teeming with the exchange of traditional forms and cultural ideas, a rich resource for Americans".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hufford|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; This diversity is celebrated annually at the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] and many other [[List of folk festivals|folklife fests]] around the country.

==Leaning into the 21st century== 
With the advent of the [[digital age]], the question once again foregrounds itself concerning the relevance of [[folklore]] in this new century. Yet the profession grows and articles and books on folklore topics proliferate. That said, the traditional role of the folklorist is indeed changing.

===Globalization===
America is known as a land of immigrants; with the exception of the first [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian nations]], everyone originally came from somewhere else. Americans are proud of their [[cultural diversity]]. For folklorists, this country represents a trove of cultures rubbing elbows with each other, mixing and matching into exciting combinations as new generations come up. It is in the study of their folklife that we begin to understand the cultural patterns underlying the different ethnic groups. Language and customs provide a window into their view of reality. "The study of varying worldviews among ethnic and national groups in America remains one of the most important unfinished tasks for folklorists and anthropologists."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv| Toelken|1996|page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;See also Dundes (2005), pg. 387. [Folklore studies is] "a discipline which has been ahead of its time in recognizing the importance of folklore in promoting ethnic pride and in providing invaluable data for the discovery of native cognitive categories and patterns of worldview and values."&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to a widespread concern, we are not seeing a loss of diversity and increasing [[cultural homogenization]] across the land.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The newness of this discussion can be seen in the references for [[Cultural homogenization]]; all sources listed have been published in 21st century.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, critics of this theory point out that as different cultures mix, the cultural landscape becomes multifaceted with the intermingling of customs. People become aware of other cultures and pick and choose different items to adopt from each other. One noteworthy example of this is the [[Hanukkah bush|Jewish Christmas Tree]], a point of some contention among American Jews.

[[Public folklore|Public sector folklore]] was introduced into the [[American Folklore Society]] in the early 1970s. These public folklorists work in museums and cultural agencies to identify and document the diverse folk cultures and folk artists in their region. Beyond this, they provide performance venues for the artists, with the twin objectives of entertainment and education about different ethnic groups. Given the [[List of folk festivals|number of folk festivals]] held around the world, it becomes clear that the cultural multiplicity of a region is presented with pride and excitement. Public folklorists are increasingly being involved in economic and community development projects to elucidate and clarify differing world views of the social groups impacted by the projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hufford|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet usage===
With the advent of the internet, the transmission of individual folklore artifacts to a worldwide audience is done in a flash. We are no longer dependent upon individual performers to find us with their song and dance; now they just broadcast across the net. An example of this is [[Joke#Electronic joking|electronic joking]], which has become as common as oral joking and can reach a much larger audience with just a button click. The folk group is no longer exclusively defined by physical presence and locality, it also exists in the connectivity of cyberspace. With this, diffusion of folklore is skewed away from a live performance toward a multiplicity of new venues and social groupings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Mason|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new transmission modes apply not only to oral folklore. Traditional skills and handicrafts can be videotaped and uploaded to [[YouTube]], enabling any interested individual anywhere in the world access to this record of specific traditional skills.&lt;ref group=note&gt;One example is found on the YouTube channel for Primitive Technology. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA&lt;/ref&gt; No longer anchored in time and space, both the social group and the channels of folklore transmission have expanded across the globe.

===Computerized databases and big data===
Once folklore artifacts have been recorded on the World Wide Web, they can be collected in large electronic databases and even moved into collections of [[big data]]. This compels folklorists to find new ways to collect and [[data curation|curate]] these data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dundes |2005|page=401}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with these new challenges, electronic data collections provide the opportunity to ask different questions, and combine with other academic fields to explore new aspects of traditional culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computational humor]] is just one new field that has taken up the traditional oral forms of jokes and anecdotes for study, holding its first dedicated conference in 1996. This takes us beyond gathering and categorizing large joke collections. Scholars are using computers firstly to recognize jokes in context,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sacks|1974|pages=337–353}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further to attempt to create jokes using [[artificial intelligence]].

===Binary thinking of the computer age===
As we move forward in the digital age, the [[binary opposition|binary thinking]] of the 20th century [[Structuralism|structuralists]] remains an important tool in the folklorist's toolbox.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sims|2005|pages=184–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that binary thinking was invented in recent times along with computers; only that we became aware of both the power and the limitations of the "either/or" construction. In folklore studies, the multiple binaries underlying much of the theoretical thinking have been identified – {dynamicism : conservatism}, {anecdote : myth}, {process : structure}, {performance : tradition}, {improvisation : repetition}, {variation : traditionalism},  {repetition : innovation};&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; not to overlook the original binary of the first folklorists: {traditional : modern} or {old : new}. Bauman re-iterates this thought pattern in claiming that at the core of all folklore is the dynamic tension between tradition and variation (or creativity).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bauman|2008|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noyes&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Noyes|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses similar vocabulary to define [folk] group as "the ongoing play and tension between, on the one hand, the fluid networks of relationship we constantly both produce and negotiate in everyday life and, on the other, the imagined communities we also create and enact but that serve as forces of stabilizing allegiance."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This thinking only becomes problematic in light of the theoretical work done on [[binary opposition]], which exposes the values intrinsic to any binary pair. Typically, one of the two opposites assumes a role of dominance over the other. The categorization of binary oppositions is "often value-laden and ethnocentric", imbuing them with illusory order and superficial meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Goody|1977|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linear and non-linear concepts of time===
Another baseline of western thought has also been thrown into disarray in the recent past. In western culture, we live in a time of [[progress (history)|progress]], moving forward from one moment to the next. The goal is to become better and better, culminating in perfection. In this model time is linear, with direct causality in the progression. "You reap what you sow", "A stitch in time saves nine", "Alpha and omega", the Christian concept of an [[afterlife]] all exemplify a cultural understanding of time as linear and progressive. In folklore studies, going backwards in time was also a valid avenue of exploration. The goal of the early folklorists of the [[Folkloristics#Aarne–Thompson and the historic-geographic method|historic-geographic school]] was to reconstruct from fragments of folk tales the Urtext of the original mythic (pre-Christian) world view. When and where was an artifact documented? Those were the important questions posed by early folklorists in their collections. Armed with these data points, a grid pattern of [[Spacetime|time-space]] coordinates for artifacts could be plotted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Toelken|1996|pages=271–274}}, {{harv|Dorst|2016|pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Awareness has grown that different cultures have different concepts of time (and space). In his study "The American Indian Mind in a Linear World", Donald Fixico describes an alternate concept of time. "Indian thinking" involves "'seeing' things from a perspective emphasizing that circles and cycles are central to world and that all things are related within the Universe." He then suggests that "the concept of time for Indian people has been such a continuum that time becomes less relevant and the rotation of life or seasons of the year are stressed as important."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rouse|2012|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;This blanket interpretation has been questioned by some as too simplistic in its sweeping application to all Native American tribes. See {{harv|Rouse|2012|page=14ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more specific example, the folklorist [[Barre Toelken]] describes the Navajo as living in circular times, which is echoed and re-enforced in their sense of space, the traditional circular or multi-sided [[hogan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Toelken|1996|pages=275ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacking the European mechanistic devices of marking time (clocks, watches, calendars), they depended on the cycles of nature: sunrise to sunset, winter to summer. Their stories and histories are not marked by decades and centuries, but remain close in, as they circle around the constant rhythms of the natural world.

Within the last decades our time scale has expanded from unimaginably small ([[nanoseconds]]) to unimaginably large ([[deep time]]). In comparison, our working concept of time as {past : present : future} looks almost quaint. How do we map "tradition" into this multiplicity of time scales? Folklore studies has already acknowledged this in the study of traditions which are either done in an annual cycle of circular time (ex. Christmas, May Day), or in a life cycle of linear time (ex. baptisms, weddings, funerals). This needs to be expanded to other traditions of oral lore. For folk narrative is NOT a linear chain of isolated tellings, going from one single performance on our time-space grid to the next single performance. Instead it fits better into a non-linear system, where one performer varies the story from one telling to the next, and the performer's understudy starts to tell the story, also varying each performance in response to multiple factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016|pages=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cybernetics===
[[Cybernetics]] was first developed in the 20th century; it investigates the functions and processes of systems. The goal in cybernetics is to identify and understand a system's closed signaling loop, in which an action by the system generates a change in the environment, which in turn triggers feedback to the system and initiates a new action. The field has expanded from a focus on mechanistic and biological systems to an expanded recognition that these theoretical constructs can also be applied to many cultural and societal systems, including folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once divorced from a model of tradition that works solely on a linear time scale (i.e. moving from one folklore performance to the next), we begin to ask different questions about how these folklore artifacts maintain themselves over generations and centuries.

The oral tradition of [[jokes]] as an example is found across all cultures, and is documented as early as 1600 B.C.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The earliest recorded joke is on an Egyptian papyrus dated at 1600 B.C. See [[:Joke#Printed jokes and the solitary laugh]].&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the subject matter varies widely to reflect its cultural context, the form of the joke remains remarkably consistent. According to the theories of cybernetics and its secondary field of [[autopoiesis]], this can be attributed to a closed loop auto-correction built into the system maintenance of oral folklore. Auto-correction in oral folklore was first articulated by the folklorist [[Walter Anderson (folklorist)|Walter Anderson]] in his monograph on the [[King John and the Bishop|King and the Abbot]] published 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Anderson|1923}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain the stability of the narrative, Anderson posited a “double redundancy”, in which the performer has heard the story from multiple other performers, and has himself performed it multiple times. This provides a feedback loop between repetitions at both levels to retain the essential elements of the tale, while at the same time allowing for the incorporation of new elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dorst|2016|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another characteristic of cybernetics and autopoiesis is self-generation within a system. Once again looking to jokes, we find new jokes generated in response to events on a continuing basis. The folklorist Bill Ellis accessed internet humor message boards to observe in real time the creation of topical jokes following the 9/11 terrorist attack in the United States. "Previous folklore research has been limited to collecting and documenting successful jokes, and only after they had emerged and come to folklorists' attention. Now, an Internet-enhanced collection creates a time machine, as it were, where we can observe what happens in the period before the risible moment, when attempts at humour are unsuccessful.", that is before they have successfully mapped into the traditional joke format.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Ellis|2002|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Second-order cybernetics]] states that the system observer affects the systemic interplay; this interplay has long been recognized as problematic by folklorists. The act of observing and noting any folklore performance raises without exception the performance from an unconscious habitual acting within a group, to and for themselves, to a performance for an outsider. "Naturally the researcher's presence changes things, in the way that any new entrant to a social setting changes things. When people of different backgrounds, agendas, and resources interact, there are social risks, and where representation and publication are taking place, these risks are exacerbated..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.afsnet.org/default.asp?page=HumanSubjects | title=AFS Position Statement on Research with Human Subjects - American Folklore Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;For a further discussion of this, see also {{harv|Schmidt-Lauber|2012|page=362ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gold lunula''' (plural: '''lunulae''') is a distinctive type of late [[Neolithic]], [[Chalcolithic]] or (most often) early [[Bronze Age]] necklace or collar shaped like a crescent moon.&lt;ref&gt;The [[British Museum]] describe the (Irish) Blessington lunula (illustrated) as "Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age, 2400BC-2000BC (circa)", [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=818350&amp;partId=1 webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; They are normally flat and thin, with roundish spatulate terminals that are often twisted to 45 to 90 degrees from the plane of the body. Gold lunulae fall into three distinct groups, termed Classical, Unaccomplished and Provincial by archaeologists.  Most have been found in Ireland, but there are moderate numbers in other parts of Europe as well, from Great Britain to areas of the continent fairly near the Atlantic coasts.  Although no lunula has been directly dated, from associations with other artefacts it is thought they were being made sometime in the period between 2200–2000 BC;&lt;ref&gt;Needham 1996, 124&lt;/ref&gt; a wooden box associated with one Irish find has recently given a [[radiocarbon dating]] range of 2460–2040 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, 277, dates "CalBC (at 95% probability)"; 276–278 discuss the dating of Irish lunulae, without reaching very firm conclusions.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the more than a hundred gold lunulae known from Western Europe, more than eighty are from Ireland;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, 49&lt;/ref&gt; it is possible they were all the work of a handful of expert goldsmiths, though the three groups are presumed to have had different creators. Several examples have a heavily crinkled appearance suggesting that they had been rolled up at some point. One Irish example, from Ballinagroun, has had its original Classical engraved decoration beaten over to erase it (not quite successfully), and then a new Unaccomplished scheme added (see below for these classifications).&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1980, 33; illustrated at Wallace 2:21&lt;/ref&gt; This and the fact that it had been folded over several times suggest that it had been in use for a long time before it was deposited.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, 60&lt;/ref&gt; The first two examples illustrated show roughly the range of widths of the lowest part of the lunula that is found.  Finds in graves are rare, perhaps suggesting they were regarded as clan or group property rather than personal possessions, and though some were found in bogs, perhaps suggesting ritual deposits, more were found on higher ground, often under standing stones.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1980, 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Most gold lunulae have decorative patterns very much resembling [[Beaker culture|beaker pottery]] from roughly the same period, using geometrical patterns made up of straight lines, with zig-zags and criss-cross patterns, and many different axes of symmetry. The curving edges of the lunula are generally followed by curving border-lines, often with decoration between them. The decoration is typically most dense at the tips and edges, and the broad lower central area is often undecorated between the borders.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, 49–50; Taylor 1980, 28ff&lt;/ref&gt; The decoration also resembles that on [[amber]] and [[Jet (lignite)|jet]] spacer necklaces, which are thought to be slightly later in date.

==Typology==
Gold lunulae have been classified into groups as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, 50; Taylor 1980, 27 onwards&lt;/ref&gt;
*Classical, perhaps all made in Ireland, on average the widest, heaviest and also thinnest group. They are thin enough to be flexible when worn, and for the incised decoration to appear as relief on their underside.  One aspect of the skill with which they are made is the variation in thickness across the piece, with the inner edge often three times thicker than the middle and the outer edge twice as thick.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1980, 35&lt;/ref&gt;  
*Unaccomplished, similar but narrower and less skilfully executed, all Irish
*Provincial, only one example found in Ireland. Thicker and more rigid, they were probably all or mostly made outside Ireland. Their decoration can be more varied, and is divided into two groups: "dot-line", found in Scotland and Wales, and "linear", found in Cornwall, Belgium and north Germany, as well as the Irish example. The northern coast of France has both types.  Punches, not otherwise used in lunulae, are used for the dots in "dot-line" types.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1980, 33&lt;/ref&gt;

It used to thought that these groups were produced in chronological sequence, but this is now much less certain, although the Ballinagroun lunula does show Unaccomplished decoration replacing Classical when it was reworked. In one large sample of 39 lunulae, the 19 Classical averaged 54 grams, with the 12 Unaccomplished averaging 40 gm.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1980, 28&lt;/ref&gt;  Finds of Classical lunulae are concentrated in the north of Ireland, probably near the sources of gold, with Unaccomplished find spots mostly forming a "peripheral border" around this area. A few Classical lunulae have been found on the north Cornish coast and in southern Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1980, 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Provincial lunulae were discovered in Kerivoa, [[Brittany]] (Kerivoa-en-Bourbriac, [[Côtes-d'Armor]]) in the remains of a box with some sheet gold and a rod of gold. The rod had its terminals hammered flat in the manner of the lunuae. From this it is thought that Lunulae were made by hammering a rod of gold flat so it became sheet-like and fitted the desired shape. Decoration was then applied by impressing designs with a stylus. The stylus used often leaves tell-tale impressions on the surface of the gold and it is thought that all the lunulae from Kerivoa, and another two from Saint-Potan, [[Brittany]] and [[Harlyn]] Bay, [[Cornwall]] were all made with the same tool. This suggests that all five lunulae were the work of one craftsperson and the contents of the Kerivoa box their tools of trade.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1980, 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Lunulae were probably replaced as neck ornaments firstly by gold [[torc]]s, found from the Irish Middle Bronze Age, and then in the Late Bronze Age by the spectacular [[gorget]]s of thin ribbed gold, some with round discs at the side, of which 9 examples survive, 7 in the [[National Museum of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, 88–89; 3:19–25&lt;/ref&gt;

The shape is sometimes found into the [[Iron Age]], now also in silver, though the relation to the much earlier Bronze Age lunulae may be tenuous.  A bronze example from the Welsh [[Llyn Cerrig Bach]] lake deposit (200 BC – 100 AD) has an embossed medallion with a [[triskele]]-based design in Celtic [[La Tène]] style, although it lacks the fastening at the back and has holes that are presumably for fixing it to a surface.  It has been suggested it fitted around the pole of a [[chariot]], or was attached to a shield, or worn by a statue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/2365/ National Museum of Wales, "Crescentic-shaped plaque"]&lt;/ref&gt; Two silver examples from [[Chão de Lamas]] in Portugal of about the 2nd century BC should perhaps be considered as flattened and widened [[torc]]s; similar pieces are worn by figures in sculpture from the same culture.

==Recent finds==
The known corpus continues to expand slowly. The UK [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]] has recorded three incomplete finds in England in recent years, in 2008, 2012 and 2014, the last only missing one terminal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://finds.org.uk/database/search/results/q/lunula/sort/objectType/objectType/LUNULA Portable Antiquities Scheme Database], accessed 23 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009 the [[Coggalbeg hoard]] surfaced in Ireland; it had actually been discovered in 1945 when cutting peat, but kept hidden. The hoard, including a lunula of the Classical type, is now in the National Museum of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://irisharchaeology.ie/2013/02/stolen-treasure-the-coggalbeg-hoard/ Stolen treasure: The Coggalbeg Hoard]".

'''Imamzadeh Mausoleum''' is a monument consists of a mausoleum and mosque, located in the center of Barda. The monument, which was the only 4 minarets built in Azerbaijan in the 14th century, was in the form of a pilgrimage-mausoleum, according to academician Dorn. A mosque was built around it in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bərdə İmamzadəsi: layihənin icrası başa çatır//İki sahil - 19 March 2015, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

[[Abbasgulu Bakikhanov | Abbasqulu Agha Bakikhanov]] mentioned in his famous Gulistani-Iram work in 1841: "In many ways, the ruins of the village and the high-ranking three imamzadehs in the cities of Shamakhi, Ganja and Barda, Imamzadeh in the Bulbule village show that this country has always been the homeland of the religious elders"  &lt;ref&gt;Gulistani-Iram 15, p.35-37&lt;/ref&gt;

According to reports, 5th Imam of Ismaili and Jafari Shiite, Mohammed al-Baqir’s granddaughter was buried here. Mohammed al-Baqir's third son, Ibrahim Isa, was buried in Goy Imamzadeh (in 739), 7th km of the city of Ganja. This monument is similar to the monument "Char Minar" in Bukhara. A.A.Bakikhanov also noted in his Gulistani-Iram work that this was a sacred place of pilgrimage in Barda. The fact that this place is a sanctuary also confirms that there is no mosque in Imamzadeh. Figured layout of the bricks of Imamzadeh mosque, coordination of stone and brick in construction, and the use of tiles appear to be influenced from [[Barda Mausoleum]] (built in 1322). The monument was rebuilt in 1868 by the famous architect [[Karbalayi Safikhan Karabakhi]] (1788, Ahar-1910, Shusha). He served in the development of Karabakh architecture. Karbalayi Safikhan Karabakhi linked the architectural elements of the eastern architecture with local traditions, especially in the mosques he built. Restoration of Imamzadeh Mosque in Barda (1868), Aghdam Mosque (1870), Ashagi Mosque in Shusha (1874-75) and Govharaga Mosque Restoration (XIX century), as well as the Tatar Mosque in Odessa (1870), Garabaghli Mosque (1880) in Ashgabat Safikhan are among works of Karabakhi.  
Believers died in other places but were buried in a cemetery around the Imamzadeh mosque in Barda, according to their testimony.

There are several historic monuments around the Imamzadeh Mosque. 20 meters to the north of the mosque, [[Bahman Mirza Qajar Mausoleum]] and to the east, ruins of [[Akhsadan Baba Mausoleum]], which was built in XIV century, are located.

The '''International Sculpture Symposium''' movement was spearheaded by [[Karl Prantl (sculptor)|Karl Prantl]] in [[Austria]] in 1959.
This initiative grew from the need to facilitate communication and exchange between members of the international sculpture community. It was also rooted in [[Cold War]] tensions, which lent a particular urgency to the need for cross-cultural dialogue on a person-to-person basis.
The first international sculpture symposium took place in an abandoned stone quarry in [[Sankt Margarethen im Burgenland]]. 

Sculptors from around the world joined together to produce a permanent public artwork from local stone, a dynamic which would provide the model for many symposia to follow. 

Since then international sculpture symposia have been held in numerous towns and cities around the world, including [[Lindabrunn, Austria]] and [[Hagi, Yamaguchi|Hagi]], [[Japan]] (a town known for its [[Japanese pottery|pottery]]). The first international sculpture symposia in the United States (and the first on a college campus) was in 1965 on the [[California State University, Long Beach]] campus in [[Long Beach, California]].

The first International Sculpture Symposium ([[Vermont International Sculpture Symposium]]) in the United States was held in [[Proctor]], [[Vermont]] in 1986 under the joint sponsorship of Vermont Marble Company, [[National Endowment for the Arts]], and Vermont Council on the Arts. Participating sculptors were from the United States, Austria, Japan, Germany, and Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="Vermont symposium-NCA"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Sculptors Symposium|url=http://www.ncmodernist.org/NCARCHITECT/1968-10.pdf|website=North Carolina Architect|publisher=The North Carolina chapter of the American Institute of Architects|accessdate=5 August 2018|pages=17–18|date=October 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first Sculpture Symposium in Australia was held at Wondabyne near Gosford in New South Wales in 1986. 
It was followed by the Barossa International Sculpture Symposium in Mengler Hill near Tanunda in the Barossa in South Australia in 1988. Nine sculptures in Marble and Granite were carved by sculptors from France, the United States, Japan and Australia. The site is now the Barossa Sculpture Park.

As part of the program in 2001, the [[Republic of South Africa]] War Memorial ''Reconciliation'' by sculptor [[Strijdom van der Merwe]] was created for the sculpture park at the [[United Nations Memorial Cemetery]] in [[Busan, South Korea]].&lt;ref name="southafrica-embassy"&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Sculpture Park|url=http://southafrica-embassy.or.kr/eng/sankorea/korean_war(UNMCK).php|work=UNMCK|publisher=Republic of South Africa Embassy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jerusalem Center for the Visual Arts''' (JCVA) is an international [[artists-in-residence]] program that hosts artists and curators in [[Israel]].

JCVA promotes cross-cultural dialogue between visiting artists and curators and their Israeli counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcah.us/exhibitions/resources Pew Center for Arts and Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt; It provides a platform for interaction with local artists, curators and art academies, as well as links to museums and general audiences. Visiting artists are invited to work, explore, inspire and be inspired by interactions with people and places. During their residency, the JCVA provides exposure of the artists and curators to the local public by organizing from time to time, exhibitions, screenings and lectures about their oeuvre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcva.org/about.asp JCVA website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Until 2004, resident artists stayed at the Mount Zion Artists' Residence, in a historic building known as the Rose House on [[Mount Zion]]. Today participants are hosted at the [[Mishkenot Sha'ananim]] Cultural Center &amp; Guest House in [[Yemin Moshe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://81.218.229.126/culture/art/rose-house-jerusalem-center-for-visual-arts.aspx Rose House Jerusalem Center for Visual Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; and in Tel Aviv. Over the years, JCVA has collaborated with the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]],  Herzliya Museum of Art, the Israeli Center for Digital Art in [[Holon]], the Center for Contemporary Art, [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]] and [[Beit Berl College]]'s [[HaMidrasha – Faculty of the Arts]].

The JCVA residency provides an opportunity for interaction with the local art community, museums and audiences. The program is designed specially for each guest by JCVA's art director. The residency is by invitation only. The program, established in 1987 by philanthropist Francis K. Lloyd, was directed in its early years by curator Yona Fischer. Since 2002, [[Nirith Nelson]] has served as art director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcva.org/about.asp JCVA website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Past participants in the program include [[Sophie Calle]], [[Daniel Buren]], [[Haim Steinbach]], [[Guenther Uecker]], [[Krzysztof Wodiczko]] (2004), [[Monika Sosnowska]] (2008), [[Wilhelm Sasnal]] (2009), [[Raqs Media Collective]] (2011), [[Joe Kubert]] (2011) and [[Harun Farocki]] (2012).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcah.us/exhibitions/resources Pew Center for Arts and Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt;

During her residency in 2002, [[Yael Bartana]] created her Kings of the Hill video, later purchased for the permanent collection of the [[Tate Modern]] in London &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/bartana-kings-of-the-hill-t11804 Bartana: Kings of the Hill]&lt;/ref&gt; and also for the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in NY.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A34409&amp;page_number=1&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 Bartana: Kings of the Hill]&lt;/ref&gt;

During her residency in 2007, [[Anila Rubiku]], who often works with local embroiderers on her complex Urban Pornitecture, was introduced to a group of traditional [[Ethiopian Jew]]ish craftswomen. Their embroidery was incorporated in Rubiku's solo exhibition "The 16 Ways" at the Braverman Gallery in Tel Aviv in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bravermangallery.com/exhibitions/the-16-ways/# Rubiku: The 16 Ways]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Monika Sosnowska]]'s work, “Stairway” 2010, was created in the wake of her residency in Tel Aviv in 2008. It was exhibited two years later at the Herzliya Museum for Contemporary Art.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.herzliyamuseum.co.il/english/september2010/sep-10-monika/monika-sosnowska Sosnowska: Stairway&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://polishinstitute.org.il/en/archive/details/162-msosnowska.html?pop=1&amp;tmpl=component Sosnowska: Stairway]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mouse.co.il/CM.articles_item,1023,209,54378,.aspx Sosnowska: Stairway]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Harun Farocki]] and Antje Ehmann conducted a workshop, “Labour in a Single Shot,” at HaMidrasha School of Art as part of a 15-city project in which students were asked to present 2-minute films on the subject of labour. The results were presented at the Tel Aviv Museum along with some of Farocki's most important works, which were exhibited in Israel for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamuseum.org.il/about-the-exhibition/labour-in-a-single-shot Farocki and Ehmann: Labour in a Single Shot]&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of '''[[Korea]]n jade carving''' dates back to [[neolithic]] finds along the [[Namgang]] river basin in [[Gyeongju]]. Jade rings and accessories were worn by the higher classes of society, especially women, from the [[three kingdoms]] period and reached their peak in the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] dynasty, the golden age of jadework. Korean jadework often includes [[buddhist]] motifs, [[cicada]]s, and peanut-shaped good luck talismans on the small scale, as well as larger-scale architectural pieces.

==Contemporary jade masters==

Amongst the most famous is [[Jang Ju-won]] who has been designated Important Intangible cultural heritage No. 100. Jang is known for his refinement, and largely self-taught has recovered jadework for future generations.

==Local Markets==

In the local markets there now exists a wide variety of jade carvings and jewelry available for purchase.  These items are much less costly than their Chinese counterparts.

'''Kurt Hummel'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deconstructingglee.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/kurtelizabethhummel.jpg|title=Ryan Murphy Q&amp;A|accessdate=November 5, 2012|date=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[fictional character]] and one of the male leads in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] musical comedy-drama series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''. Series creators [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]], [[Brad Falchuk]] and [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] initially conceived of him as a fashionable [[homosexual|gay]] [[countertenor]] who is routinely [[bullying|bullied]] at school. Kurt is portrayed by actor [[Chris Colfer]], and has appeared as a character on the show since its [[Pilot (Glee)|pilot episode]], first broadcast on May 19, 2009. ''Glee'' follows the trials of the New Directions [[glee club]] at the fictional William McKinley High School in the town of [[Lima, Ohio]], of which Kurt is a member. His storylines in the [[Glee (season 1)|first season]] focus on his struggle with his sexual identity as he discloses his homosexuality to his father and friends, and deals with his romantic feelings for [[Finn Hudson]], the heterosexual co-captain of the glee club.

In the show's [[Glee (season 2)|second season]], Kurt is forced to transfer to a private school for his own safety after a [[closeted]] classmate bullies him relentlessly and then threatens to kill him. Kurt joins the Dalton Academy Warblers, the school's glee club, which is a competition rival of New Directions, and is befriended by their openly gay lead singer [[Blaine Anderson]]. Later on, the two become romantically involved. Their relationship has been well received by critics, and they have been named "one of the most beloved TV couples of the millennium" by Jarett Wieselman of the ''[[New York Post]]''.&lt;ref name="NYP"/&gt; Kurt eventually transfers back to McKinley and rejoins New Directions, but continues his relationship with Blaine, who transfers to McKinley in the [[Glee (season 3)|third season]]. In the [[Glee (season 4)|fourth season]], Kurt moves to New York City with his best friend and rival [[Rachel Berry]], where he pursues his musical education while interning for [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue.com]]. For the remainder of the series, ''Glee'' charts Kurt's life in Lima and New York as he grapples with young adulthood and realising his career ambitions.

Colfer describes Kurt as projecting a very confident "I'm better than you" personality, despite being a typically scared and anxious teenager.&lt;ref name="starry"/&gt; Kurt's solos for New Directions tend to be songs—usually [[show tunes]]—traditionally performed by women, which best suit his countertenor voice. His occasionally complex—but always loving—relationship with his father has been a focus for the show. Colfer's portrayal of Kurt has received much critical praise, and he has been the recipient of several awards, including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor&amp;nbsp;– Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film]] at the 2011 [[Golden Globe Awards]]. He has also garnered many award nominations, which include the 2010 and 2011 [[Emmy Award]]s for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]]. In April 2011, Colfer was named one of the 2011 [[Time 100]], [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']]'s list of the 100 most influential people.

==Casting and creation==
Prior to being cast in ''Glee'', Colfer had no professional acting experience.&lt;ref name="rewrite"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-gleestage26-2009apr26,0,1653470.story | title=Video: 'Glee' team rewrites the school musical | first=Denise |last=Martin | work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]] | date=April 26, 2009 | accessdate=May 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He originally auditioned for the role of [[Artie Abrams]], performing "[[Chicago (musical)#Musical numbers|Mr. Cellophane]]" from the musical ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''. Murphy was so impressed by his performance that the role of Kurt was created for him.&lt;ref name="bs" /&gt; To keep the number of students in the glee club constant, a character named Rajish was cut from the show.&lt;ref name="huluvid"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/77856/glee-up-close-with-chris-colfer| title=Glee: Up Close with Chris Colfer |work=[[Hulu]].com|publisher=[[Fox Entertainment Group|Fox]]| accessdate=March 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurt's name is inspired by the character Kurt von Trapp from ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', a role that Colfer once played as a child.&lt;ref name="rewrite"/&gt; The Hummel surname comes from the popular German [[Hummel figurines]]; Colfer explained in an interview that Murphy thought he had their rosy-cheeked complexion.&lt;ref name="huluvid2"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/154679/late-night-with-jimmy-fallon-chris-colfer-part-1| title=Late Night with Jimmy Fallon: Chris Colfer, Part 1 |work=[[Hulu]].com|publisher=[[NBC]]|accessdate=March 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy praised Colfer's abilities despite his lack of formal training, saying, "I just thought he was so talented and gifted and unusual. I've never seen anyone who looks like him or acts like him or sounds like him. You'd think he’d been at Juilliard for six years but he hasn't."&lt;ref name="LAtimesblog"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/09/glee-creator-and-executive-producer-ryan-murphy-discovered-chris-colfer-but-dont-tell-the-young-actor-that-it-makes-him-feel.html | title=Chris Colfer's journey from small town to 'Glee{{'-}}| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]| date=September 8, 2009 | accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy saw something of himself in the young actor, a fact that Colfer says is "completely mind-blowing". Colfer added, "For him to see me in him, I can't even describe it."&lt;ref name="LAtimesblog"/&gt;

After being cast, Colfer said that he was happy "to be a part of something that is so new and different and so needed at this time", and added, "It's good to have something positive, especially for kids in small towns, like myself, who need a little pick-me-up."&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-glee26-2009apr26,0,7366573.story | title= Will TV audiences watch with 'Glee'? | last=Fernandez|first=Maria Elena | work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]| date=April 26, 2009 | accessdate= June 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurt has twice been portrayed as a child: in the episode "[[Grilled Cheesus]]", a series of flashback scenes show Kurt at the age of eight, in which the character is played by Adam Kolkin.&lt;ref name="zap2it"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/10/glees-young-kurt-meet-adam-kolkin-chris-colfers-mini-me.html | title={{-'}}Glee's Young Kurt: Meet Adam Kolkin, Chris Colfer's mini-me | first=Carina | last=MacKenzie | work=[[Zap2it]] | publisher=[[Tribune Media Services]] | date=October 5, 2010 | accessdate=February 27, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314095411/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/10/glees-young-kurt-meet-adam-kolkin-chris-colfers-mini-me.html | archivedate=March 14, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kolkin was thirteen at the time of the audition, which called for an eight-year-old, he was chosen in part because his resemblance to Colfer was "so uncanny even the casting directors were taken aback".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/news/kolkin-268628-glee-kurt.html|title=O.C. teen to play younger Kurt on 'Glee{{'-}}|last=Fletcher|first=Jaimee Lynn|work=[[The Orange County Register]]|publisher=[[Freedom Communications]]|date=September 29, 2010|accessdate=October 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurt has also been shown even younger—in the episode "[[The Substitute (Glee)|The Substitute]]", club director [[Will Schuester]] ([[Matthew Morrison]]) comes down with the flu and has a hallucination of the students as preschoolers; all twelve glee club members, including Kurt, are played by very young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20302134_20442631_20877628,00.html|title=Mini-'Glee'! 12 Cast Faves...as Kids!|date=November 16, 2010|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|accessdate=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, Murphy announced that the cast of ''Glee'' would be replaced at the end of the [[Glee (season 3)|third season]] to coincide with their graduation.&lt;ref name="replaced"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/57149/Lea-Michele-And-Glee-Cast-To-Be-Replaced-In-2012 |title=Lea Michele and Glee Cast to be replaced in 2012? |last=Sanders |first=Helen |work=Entertainment Wise.com |publisher=Giant Digital |date=December 2, 2010 |accessdate=February 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310115546/http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/57149/Lea-Michele-And-Glee-Cast-To-Be-Replaced-In-2012 |archivedate=March 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said, "Every year we're going to populate a new group. There's nothing more depressing than a high schooler with a bald spot." He also revealed that some of the original cast would leave as early as 2012: "I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers' lives."&lt;ref name="replaced"/&gt; Murphy stated in July 2011 that Colfer would be one of the actors leaving at the end of the third season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/glee-lea-michele-chris-colfer-210869|title={{-'}}Glee' Exclusive: Lea Michele, Chris Colfer, Cory Monteith Not Returning for Season 4|first=Lesley|last=Goldberg|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=July 12, 2011|date=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Colfer commented on the report, saying, "We had kind of known since the beginning, since we started the show, that these characters were going to grow up and they were going to graduate eventually. I don't think I thought it was going to happen so soon, necessarily, but I think we knew something like this was coming."&lt;ref name="fired"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.etonline.com/tv/112429_Chris_Colfer_Found_Out_He_Was_Leaving_Glee_on_Twitter/|title=Chris Colfer Found Out He Was Leaving 'Glee' on Twitter|last=Hirsch|first=Lisa|work=[[Entertainment Tonight]]|publisher=[[CBS Television Distribution]]|date=July 14, 2011|accessdate=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Falchuk later said that while Colfer, along with [[Lea Michele]] and [[Cory Monteith]], would graduate at the end of the third season, their graduation did not mean that they would leave the show. Falchuk insisted that "it was never our plan or our intention to let them go.... They are not done with the show after this season."&lt;ref name=MicheleMonteithColferStaying&gt;{{cite web|last=Mitovich|first=Matt|title=Glee Boss: Chris Colfer, Cory Monteith and Lea Michele Are Staying, But Sam Won't Be Back|url=http://www.tvline.com/2011/07/glee-comic-con-michele-monteith-colfer-overstreet/|work=[[TV Line]]|publisher=[[Mail.com Media]]|date=July 24, 2011|accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storylines==

===Season 1===
In the show's [[Pilot (Glee)|pilot episode]], Kurt auditions for the New Directions glee club by performing "Mr. Cellophane" from ''Chicago''. Although he initially hides his [[homosexuality]], many of the other members assume he is gay. He confides that he is gay to fellow glee club member [[Mercedes Jones|Mercedes]] ([[Amber Riley]]) in "[[Acafellas]]", and the two develop a close friendship.&lt;ref name="Acafellas"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Acafellas |episodelink=Acafellas |series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=John Scott (director), [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=September 16, 2009 |season=1 |number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Preggers"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Preggers |episodelink=Preggers (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Falchuk]] (director, writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=September 23, 2009 |season=1 |number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following episode, "[[Preggers (Glee)|Preggers]]", Kurt joins the school football team as a [[Kicker (American football)|kicker]] in order to impress his widowed father, [[Burt Hummel]] ([[Mike O'Malley]]), and helps the failing team win its first game by kicking the tie-breaking extra point. His heightened confidence leads him to disclose his homosexuality to his father, who not only responds with love and acceptance, but also surprises Kurt by telling him that he has long been aware that Kurt was gay.&lt;ref name="Preggers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kurt-bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox.com/glee/bios/chris-colfer/ |title=Chris Colfer as Kurt Hummel |work=Fox.com |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company]] |accessdate=January 31, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/656DXoF92?url=http://www.fox.com/glee/bios/chris-colfer/ |archivedate=January 31, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurt quits the football team in "[[Mash-Up (Glee)|Mash-Up]]", when Coach [[Characters of Glee#Ken Tanaka|Ken Tanaka]] ([[Patrick Gallagher (actor)|Patrick Gallagher]]) forces the glee club members of the team to choose between the club and the team.&lt;ref name="Mash-Up"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Mash-Up |episodelink=Mash-Up (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits= [[Elodie Keene]] (director), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=October 21, 2009 |season=1 |number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurt competes against the glee club's star singer [[Rachel Berry]] (Lea Michele) for a solo on "[[Defying Gravity (song)|Defying Gravity]]" from the musical ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]''. However, after Burt receives a phone call labeling his son "a fag", Kurt intentionally misses the song's high note in order to lose the competition and save his father from further harassment.&lt;ref name="Wheels"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Wheels |episodelink=Wheels (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Paris Barclay]] (director), [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=November 11, 2009 |season=1 |number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode "[[Ballad (Glee)|Ballad]]", Kurt is teamed with club member and quarterback [[Finn Hudson]] (Cory Monteith), for whom he harbors romantic feelings.&lt;ref name="Ballad"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Ballad |episodelink=Ballad (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Falchuk]] (director, writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=November 18, 2009 |season=1 |number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is aware that Rachel is also attracted to Finn, and attempts to sabotage her chances with him by giving her a bad [[makeover]].&lt;ref name="Hairography"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Hairography |episodelink=Hairography|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Bill D'Elia]] (director), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=November 25, 2009 |season=1 |number=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[The Power of Madonna]]", Kurt and Mercedes, dissatisfied with their limited solo opportunities within the glee club, become singers for the school's cheerleading squad, the Cheerios. Although Mercedes soon resigns from the squad, Kurt stays through the National cheerleading competition, and performs a major solo in the routine that wins the Cheerios their sixth consecutive national championship.&lt;ref name="Funk"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Funk |episodelink=Funk (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits= [[Elodie Keene]] (director), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=June 1, 2010 |season=1 |number=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurt introduces his father to Finn's mother [[Carole Hudson|Carole]] ([[Romy Rosemont]]) in the hope that if the two began dating, it would bring Kurt closer to Finn. Finn is initially unhappy when he finds out his mother is in a serious relationship, but he soon bonds with Burt over sports and other traditionally masculine activities.&lt;ref name= "HomeIGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/108/1086687p1.html|title=Glee: "Home" Review|last=Goldman|first=Eric|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|date=April 28, 2010|accessdate=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurt, who becomes jealous over their growing relationship, briefly attempts to reclaim his father's attention by acting more masculine: he imitates Burt's style of dress, asks him for advice on performing songs by his favorite artist, [[John Mellencamp]], and arranges to have Burt walk in on him kissing cheerleader and glee club member [[Brittany Pierce]] ([[Heather Morris]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/laryngitis,41066/|title=Laryngitis|last=VanDerWerff|first=Todd|work=[[The A.V.

Aware of Kurt's attraction to him, Finn is uncomfortable with sharing a bedroom with Kurt. In the hopes of pleasing Finn, Kurt redecorates their bedroom, but Finn is appalled by its fancy appearance and lack of privacy. During the ensuing argument, when Kurt refuses to acknowledge his infatuation, Finn loses his temper and calls the new furnishings "faggy".

===Season 2===
Burt suffers a heart attack early in the [[Glee (season 2)|second season]]. He is comatose for several days, and Kurt is terrified that he might lose him. When members of the glee club sing religious songs to comfort him, Kurt, who does not believe in God, feels alienated, and lashes out at them. Burt eventually regains consciousness, and Kurt takes charge of his recovery.&lt;ref name="cheesus review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duets"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Duets|episodelink=Duets (Glee)|series=Glee |series-link=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Eric Stoltz]] (director), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=October 12, 2010 |season=2 |number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode "[[Duets (Glee)|Duets]]", Kurt suspects new glee club member and transfer student [[Sam Evans]] ([[Chord Overstreet]]) is gay and recruits Sam to be his teammate in the club's duets competition. Finn attempts to dissuade Kurt from partnering with Sam by predicting that Sam will be bullied to the point of quitting the club if he sings a duet with another male student. After Burt points out that Kurt may be taking advantage of Sam, Kurt terminates the partnership, and performs a "duet" with himself, singing "Le Jazz Hot!" from ''[[Victor Victoria]]''. With unusual empathy, Rachel notices how lonely and unhappy Kurt seems, and realizes how hard it is for him to be the only publicly gay student at school. She reminds Kurt that the club members value him highly and that he is not alone, and asks him to sing the [[Judy Garland]] / [[Barbra Streisand]] duet of "[[Get Happy (song)|Get Happy]]" and "[[Happy Days Are Here Again]]" with her.&lt;ref name="Duets"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/duets,46184/|title=Duets|last=VanDerWerff|first=Todd|work=[[The A.V.

In "[[Never Been Kissed (Glee)|Never Been Kissed]]", Kurt goes to spy on the Dalton Academy glee club, the Warblers—New Directions' primary competition for Sectionals—and meets openly gay student [[Blaine Anderson]] ([[Darren Criss]]), who then flirts with him while singing lead in a Warblers performance of "Teenage Dream".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterelton.com/people/2011/01/darren-criss-glee-teenage-dream|title=Interview: Darren Criss Humbly Calls Himself the "Last Grain of Sand{{"-}}|last=Jensen|first=Michael|date=January 18, 2011|work=[[AfterEllen.com and AfterElton.com|AfterElton.com]]|publisher=[[Logo (TV channel)|Logo]]|accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurt tells Blaine that he is being tormented by a homophobic bully at his high school, and Blaine convinces him to stand up for himself.

Kurt invites Blaine to the McKinley junior prom in "[[Prom Queen (Glee)|Prom Queen]]". The attendees greet Karofsky's election as Prom King with great enthusiasm, but a stunned silence falls when Kurt is declared Prom Queen due to having received an overwhelming number of unwanted write-in votes in the secret balloting. Humiliated, Kurt flees in tears, but is able to calm down and return for his coronation; his comment—"Eat your heart out, [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Kate Middleton]]"—garners applause that swells into an ovation. The traditional dance between King and Queen is next, and Karofsky is faced with having to partner with a boy in front of his classmates. He rejects Kurt's suggestion to [[coming out|come out]] at the prom, and abandons Kurt on the dance floor as the music begins; Blaine dances with Kurt instead.&lt;ref name="Prom Queen"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Prom Queen |episodelink=Prom Queen (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Eric Stoltz]] (director), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=May 10, 2011 |season=2 |number=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the season, the glee club travels to the Nationals competition in New York City.

===Season 3===
Blaine gives in to Kurt's urgings and wishes and transfers to McKinley High so they can spend more time together during Kurt's senior year. Kurt and Rachel decide they want to apply to a top school for the dramatic arts in New York City, NYADA, but are intimidated when they meet some of their competition and decide their applications need to include more accomplishments: Rachel proposes that McKinley do ''[[West Side Story]]'' as the school musical so she can star in it, and Kurt runs for class president.&lt;ref name="Purple"&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Purple Piano Project|episodelink=The Purple Piano Project|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Eric Stoltz]] (director), [[Brad Falchuk]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=September 20, 2011 |season=3 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brittany volunteers to be his campaign manager, and he accepts, but when he objects to her suggestions for posters and paraphernalia as overemphasizing his sexuality, she decides to run for the office herself.&lt;ref name="Unicorn"&gt;{{cite episode |title=I Am Unicorn|episodelink=I Am Unicorn|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Falchuk]] (director), [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=September 27, 2011 |season=3 |number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurt tries out for the musical, but the directors aren't convinced that he's masculine enough to portray Tony, the romantic male lead, and cast Blaine instead, even though he's only a junior; Kurt is given the minor role of Officer Krupke.&lt;ref name="Unicorn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Asian F"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Asian F|episodelink=Asian F|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Alfonso Gomez-Rejon]] (director), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=October 4, 2011 |season=3 |number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Rachel believes that she might not be cast as Maria, the female lead, she panics and decides to run for class president as well, infuriating Kurt.&lt;ref name="Asian F"/&gt; She eventually withdraws and throws her support behind Kurt, and secretly decides to help him further by stuffing the ballot box in his favor.

In "[[The First Time (Glee)|The First Time]]", Kurt and Blaine discuss whether or not to [[have sex]]. When Blaine goes to Dalton to invite the Warblers to see him in ''West Side Story'', he is pursued by a new warbler Sebastian Smythe ([[Grant Gustin]]). Sebastian convinces Kurt and Blaine to go with him to a local gay bar—he supplies the fake IDs—and spends half the night dancing with Blaine. When they leave, a drunk and aroused Blaine urges Kurt to have sex with him in the back seat of the car. Kurt refuses, and Blaine walks home. He later tells Kurt that he was just nervous about the possibility of their first time, and that he cares nothing for Sebastian. They kiss onstage in the empty auditorium, and Kurt proposes that they go over to Blaine's house for the night, where they have sex together for the first time.&lt;ref name="First Time"&gt;{{cite episode |title=The First Time|episodelink=The First Time (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=Bradley Buecker (director), [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=November 8, 2011 |season=3 |number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode "[[Michael (Glee)|Michael]]", New Directions and the Warblers compete for the right to perform Michael Jackson's music at Regionals by singing his song "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]".

In "[[Dance with Somebody (Glee)|Dance with Somebody]]", Kurt feels that Blaine has been distant, and confides in a boy named Chandler he meets at the local music store. The two hit it off instantly with their common interest of moving to New York after high school. Kurt begins texting Chandler quite often soon after that. Rachel thinks he's being in the wrong that Kurt is cheating on Blaine instead of talking to Blaine about the rut they are in. Blaine finds out about Chandler and is extremely hurt. Both Kurt and Blaine sing Whitney songs to express how they feel about their situation with Blaine singing [[It's Not Right but It's Okay]] and Kurt singing [[I Have Nothing]] as an apology. Eventually after having a talk in Emma's office, the two make up and are stronger than ever.&lt;ref name="Dance with Somebody"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Dance with Somebody|episodelink=Dance with Somebody (Glee)|series=Glee|serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=Paris Barclay (director), [[Ross Maxwell]](writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=April 24, 2012 |season=3|number=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Goodbye (Glee)|Goodbye]]", Blaine is worried that he and Kurt will not make it as a couple after Kurt graduates and moves off to New York. Kurt reassures him that they will be okay as a couple. After graduation, Kurt, Rachel and Finn's letters from the New York schools they applied to come in. Kurt does not get accepted to NYADA.&lt;ref name="Goodbye"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Goodbye|episodelink=Goodbye (Glee)|series=Glee|serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=Brad Falchuk (director), [[Brad Falchuk]](writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=May 22, 2012 |season=3|number=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 4===
In Season 4, Kurt joins Rachel in New York after she reveals that she is unhappy with her roommate and life at that point. After the encouragement of Blaine and his father, he decides to sell his car and fly to New York, where he finds a loft in Bushwick for him and Rachel to move into. Kurt applies for a job at Vogue.com and his editor, Isabelle Wright, who is also from Ohio, hires him partially based upon his portfolio of outfits and is impressed with his intuition and style. Early on, she leans on his support, and then quickly returns his support when he decides to give Rachel a makeover in the Vogue closet. Instead of being angry, she loves his idea to do a musical makeover for the website and joins in the makeover. Kurt becomes increasingly busy with his job at Vogue, and Blaine cheats on him in Lima. He comes to New York to tell Kurt what happened, and they break up.

Kurt continues working at Vogue throughout the season, and Isabelle encourages him to try to forgive Blaine, and at Thanksgiving, she brings her friends over to their loft and throws him a "kiki." When Kurt reauditions for NYADA, he is initially rejected, because Carmen Tibideaux sees his technical skill and tells him that he can sell a number, but doesn't believe that he is emotional enough to be an artist. Later, when Kurt is at the Winter Showcase to support Rachel, she sees him moved by Rachel's piece, and announces that he will be auditioning after the intermission. Though he initially panics, Rachel convinces him that he doesn't need his bells and whistles to perform, and he chooses to sing "Being Alive" from Company, which impresses the NYADA audience, and he later gets a letter telling him that he has gotten in.

At Christmas, Kurt elects not to go back home, and so his father comes up to New York to set up his Christmas tree and spend some time with him. At this point, he tells Kurt that he has prostate cancer. He also has brought Blaine with him, who tries to win back Kurt's trust, but the trip is uneasy. When Kurt begins at NYADA, he struggles initially to find his place, and meets a student named Adam Crawford, a senior who wants to recruit him for his own show choir, Adam's Apples, and also seems interested in Kurt himself; Kurt eventually asks him out for coffee. While at Will and Emma's wedding, Kurt and Blaine hook up, leaving their relationship in a question, since Kurt is dating Adam, but not exclusive. When Kurt returns to New York, there is a snowstorm, leaving Kurt, Rachel, Santana, and Adam stuck together in the loft watching movies together. Santana strongly hints about Kurt's hook up with Blaine, and after they are back at school, Adam asks Kurt about his feelings for Blaine. Kurt says that he is desperately trying to get over Blaine, and Adam invites him to find their own romantic movie.

When Santana moves in with him and Rachel, Kurt tries to keep Santana from telling Rachel about Brody prostituting himself. But Santana tells Rachel anyway, much to Kurt's dismay. Later, Kurt and Rachel confront Santana for working at a club dancing and try to encourage her to take a dance class from the extension school of NYADA to keep her skills honed. Still working at Vogue, Kurt is put in charge of a ballet gala, and invites Rachel and Santana to help. He and Rachel reveal that they both had experiences with ballet as children, and Kurt started ballet at the age of three years when his mother decided to take him. He bribes Santana to go with a designer dress, and once they are at the gala, she admits she was in ballet as a child too and loved it. When Kurt returns to Lima, it is to be there for his father's doctor's visit, and his anxiety is apparent throughout his interactions with his friends. However, in the doctor's office, Kurt, Burt, and Carole learn that Burt's cancer has gone into remission, and Kurt takes his father to the Glee club to sing "Sunshine of My Life" to him, which Kurt says Burt used to sing to him when he was little.

===Season 5===
In the season premiere, "[[Love, Love, Love (Glee)|Love, Love, Love]]", Kurt, who is still in Lima, agrees to get back together with Blaine. Emboldened, Blaine decides to ask Kurt to marry him, which he does in an extravagant proposal at Dalton Academy, in the spot where the two met. Kurt accepts.&lt;ref name="Love, Love, Love"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Love, Love, Love|episodelink=Love, Love, Love (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=Bradley Buecker (director), [[Brad Falchuk]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=September 26, 2013 |season=5 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is back in New York in "[[Tina in the Sky with Diamonds]]", and gets a job at the diner where Rachel and Santana are working. He then returns to Lima in "[[The Quarterback (Glee)|The Quarterback]]" for his stepbrother Finn's funeral and subsequent memorial, and he grieves with his parents and friends.&lt;ref name="The Quarterback"&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Quarterback |episodelink=The Quarterback (Glee) |series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Falchuk]] (director, writer), [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (writer), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=October 10, 2013 |season=5 |number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurt was still living in New York, but he was visiting his father in Lima

===Season 6===
During the season, Kurt and Blaine have broken up but eventually reunite in time for Brittany and Santana's wedding. At the two's insistence, Kurt and Blaine get married alongside them. In 2020, they are still married and are a celebrity couple. Rachel is pregnant with their child who is assumed to be a girl.

==Characterization==
[[File:Ryan Murphy by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The scene where Kurt comes out is taken verbatim from the life of ''Glee'' creator [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (''pictured'').]]
According to Colfer, ''Glee''{{'}}s creators initially "were leaning on [Kurt] being overly flamboyant". However, the actor stated that he did not want to take that approach "because it's so overdone". Instead, he decided to portray the character as "more internal and superior."&lt;ref name="LAtimesblog"/&gt; Colfer has explained that Kurt "puts on a very confident, 'I'm better than you' persona," but that "underneath it all he's the same anxious and scared teen everyone is/was at some point." Colfer also commented, "In later episodes, [Kurt] goes through an identity crisis, accepting and finding acceptance for who he is. He's a tough guy in designer clothes."&lt;ref name="starry"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://starrymag.com/content.asp?ID=4321&amp;CATEGORY=INTERVIEWS |title=Chris Colfer&amp;nbsp;— Pure Glee |last=Steinberg|first=Jamie |work=Starry Constellation Magazine|date=May 2009|accessdate=June 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrasting Kurt to his own personality, Colfer stated that Kurt is "very flamboyant and superior and uppity and into fashion", while Colfer had never heard of fashion designer [[Marc Jacobs]] before Kurt referenced him in the pilot episode.&lt;ref name=Colfertvinterview&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/chris-colfer,41850/ |title=Chris Colfer |last=VanDerWerff|first=Todd|date=June 7, 2010|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|publisher=[[Onion, Inc.|Onion, Inc]]|accessdate=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second-season episode "Grilled Cheesus" centered around Kurt's [[atheism]], with Murphy explaining that Kurt is "saying to the world, 'Prove [me] wrong: If God is kindness and love, make me believe in God.{{' "}}&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Glee-Grilled-Cheesus-1023969.aspx?rss=news&amp;partnerid=spi&amp;profileid=05|title=Are You There, God?

Kurt reveals himself to be gay early in the show's first season. The scene in which he tells his father was taken verbatim from Murphy's own life. Murphy felt that the scene was "a great thing to put on television", because, while gay characters are often isolated and attacked, audiences have rarely seen an openly gay character who "wins and triumphs".&lt;ref name="Colfer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/09/entertainment/et-colfer9|title={{-'}}Glee's' Chris Colfer fits right in|last=Fernandez|first=Maria Elena|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=September 9, 2009|accessdate=January 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further explained, "The show is about making you feel good in the end. It's about happy endings and optimism and the power of your personal journey and making you feel that the weird thing about me is the great thing about me. I've done other shows with gay characters, and I will say that in many of those cases, the gay characters didn't have a happy ending. And I thought you know what? Enough."&lt;ref name="Colfer"/&gt; Colfer has commented that his biggest challenge was in ensuring the scene felt "honest" and not comical or "used as a punchline". He explained, "I think it's probably the first time a character's sexuality has been respected and almost dignified in a way, and I think that's really important, and there needs to be more of that on TV."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2009/11/chris_colfer_on_playing_kurt_i.html|title=Glee's Chris Colfer on Owning 'Defying Gravity' and Resembling a Hummel Figurine|last=Milzoff|first=Rebecca|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|publisher=New York Media Holdings|date=November 16, 2009|accessdate=January 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurt’s acute sense of fashion is exhibited in his on-screen wardrobe. ''Glee''{{'}}s costume designer [[Lou Eyrich]] said in an interview with the ''[[Seattle Times]]'' that Kurt is one of her favorite characters to dress: "He never, ever repeats and you get to push yourself creatively.

Kurt has a close relationship with his father Burt, who openly accepts his son after Kurt tells him that he is gay in the show's fourth episode, "Preggers". As the series progresses their relationship continues to grow stronger. Colfer has credited his off-screen relationship with O'Malley with improving the quality of their scenes together.&lt;ref name="MastersCC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b178380__i_Glee__i__s_Chris_Colfer__There_s_More_Daddy_Drama_to_Come.html|title=Glee's Chris Colfer: There's More Daddy Drama to Come|last=Masters|first=Megan|work=[[E!

The first occurrence is initially alluded to in the episode "Acafellas", in which Kurt tells his friend Mercedes that he does have feelings for someone. Mercedes mistakenly assumes that Rachel, the glee club's lead singer, is the object of Kurt's affections, and although he later tells Mercedes that he is gay, he does not reveal to her that he is actually in love with the club's male lead, Finn.&lt;ref name="Acafellas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b127287_glees_coming-out_episode_respectful.html|title=Glee's Coming-Out Episode: "Respectful &amp; Touching{{"-}}|last=Borzillo-Vrenna|first=Callie|work=[[E!

Before production on the second season began, Murphy confirmed that Kurt would be paired with a new romantic interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/01/18/exclusive-glee-spoilers-rachel-puck/|title=Exclusive: 'Glee' boss on Rachel/Puck relationship, Kurt's new BF, and Madonna!|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|first=Michael|last=Ausiello|authorlink=Michael Ausiello|last2=Malkin|first2=Mark|date=August 31, 2010|accessdate=September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chord Overstreet, his character Sam Evans was originally intended to become Kurt's love interest.

Murphy was unsure at first whether their relationship would become a romantic one, and stated that he wished to gauge public response to their friendship before planning future developments. He commented, "Part of me thinks he should be the boyfriend, part of me thinks he should just be the mentor. I didn't want to decide that until we got into sort of the middle of the season."&lt;ref name="AE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterelton.com/people/2010/11/glee-ryan-murphy-darren-criss-kurt-hummel |title=Exclusive!

In a July 2012 interview with ''[[E! News]]'', Colfer elaborated in regard to the progression of the Kurt-Blaine relationship in the show's fourth season. Colfer said, "I would like to do something besides say 'I love you,' and I think Darren [Criss] and I agree on that. We're ready for the next step. They've been together for a while. Let's throw some spice and drama into that."&lt;ref name="enews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/332350/glee-s-chris-colfer-wants-drama-for-kurt-blaine-hopes-to-sing-britney-spears-in-tribute-episode|title=Glee's Chris Colfer Wants "Drama" for Kurt &amp; Blaine, Hopes to Sing Britney Spears in Tribute Episode|last=Maldon|first=Mark|date=July 23, 2012|work=[[E!

To begin the show's fourth season, Kurt moves to New York while Blaine continues to go to high school in Ohio, though he and Blaine remain a couple. However, after Blaine cheats on him, Kurt breaks up with Blaine. The two later agree to remain friends, though Kurt is unwilling to resume their relationship. That winter, Kurt begins to see Adam Crawford, a senior at his new school, NYADA. Despite this, Kurt has sex with Blaine when in Ohio to attend a wedding, putting into question whether Kurt still wants to be with Blaine.

Despite all this, Kurt and Blaine do get back together in a romantic relationship in the first episode of the fifth season, "Love Love Love", which is incidentally the same episode that Blaine proposes marriage. Kurt says yes immediately.

Kurt heads back to New York while Blaine finishes high school back in Lima. Eventually, midway through the fifth season, Blaine graduates and moves in with Kurt. They have difficulties and agree that it would be best for them to continue with their engagement but as Blaine lives somewhere else for now as they both need their space. They will cohabitate in the season five finale.

At the beginning for the sixth season, it seems as though Kurt and Blaine have broken off the engagement due to difficulties living together and Blaine has moved back to Lima. Kurt later regrets this and decides to continue his schooling in Lima, to try to win Blaine back.

When Kurt returns, he finds that Blaine is in a relationship with Karofsky. Despite everything that goes on in the beginning of the sixth season, Kurt and Blaine get back together in the beginning of the episode, "A Wedding". Later in the same episode, Brittany and Sue Sylvester persuade the couple to get married at Brittany and Santana's wedding to make a double gay wedding.

They continue through the rest of the sixth season as a wed couple and in the season six finale, "Dreams Come True", it is revealed that five years in the future, Rachel is carrying their child, a daughter.

==Musical performances==
As Kurt, Colfer features in many songs that have been released as [[Single (music)|singles]] available for [[Music download|digital download]] and are also included in the show's [[soundtrack album]]s.&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.music.ign.com/articles/104/1041554p1.html |title=Glee: The Music&amp;nbsp;– Vol. 1 Review |last=Linder |first=Brian |date=November 4, 2009 |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[News Corporation]] |accessdate=December 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wSLW7cmC?url=http://uk.music.ign.com/articles/104/1041554p1.html |archivedate=February 13, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNV2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.music.ign.com/articles/105/1053108p1.html |title=Glee: The Music, Vol. 2 Review |last=Linder |first=Brian |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[News Corporation]] |date=December 8, 2009 |accessdate=December 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713004603/http://uk.music.ign.com/articles/105/1053108p1.html |archivedate=July 13, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode "[[Wheels (Glee)|Wheels]]", Kurt performs "Defying Gravity" from the Broadway musical ''Wicked''. Murphy selected "Defying Gravity" for the episode after Colfer related a story in which his own high school drama teacher had refused him the opportunity to perform the song because it was written to be sung by a female singer.&lt;ref name="bs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backstage.com/bso/news-and-features-features/life-stages-1004009175.story|title=Life Stages |last=Kuhn|first=Sarah|work=[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]]|publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media]]|date=September 3, 2009|accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="colferkugeltwo"&gt;{{cite news| title = Glee Star Chris Colfer Shares His Best Behind-the-Scenes Moments and Surreal Adventures| first = Allison| last = Kugel| authorlink = Allison Kugel| url=http://www.pr.com/article/1151| work= PR.com|publisher=PR Worldwide, Inc.|date = April 26, 2010| accessdate = May 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy explained, "I found a way to write it into the show because that's in a nutshell what this show is about: someone being told that they can't do something because of what the perception of them is as opposed to what their real ability is."&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt; Colfer stated that the opportunity to sing the song "meant the world" to him, and that "it's absolutely terrifying to watch yourself do something you've dreamed about for such a long time. I know I'm definitely not the best singer, but I think the message, the story behind the song about defying limits and borders placed by others, hopefully all that gets across with the performance. Although I do some very 'Kurtsy' things in the song, it's probably one of the most honest and close-to-heart scenes I've ever filmed or performed for that matter."&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt; Colfer's recording of the performance was released as a single, as well as two additional versions—one sung by co-star Michele, and another that was arranged as a duet for the two singers. The duet version charted at number thirty-one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot&amp;nbsp;100]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2009-12-05/hot-100?order=drop|title=Hot 100: Week of December 05, 2009 (Biggest Fall)|date=December 5, 2009|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was included on the show's first soundtrack album, ''[[Glee: The Music, Volume&amp;nbsp;1]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1660594|pure_url=yes}}|title=Glee: The Music, Vol. 1|publisher=[[Allmusic]].

In "Grilled Cheesus", when members of the glee club are singing songs about religion and spirituality, Kurt sings The Beatles' "[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]", dedicating the song to his father, who is in a coma in the hospital. Murphy stated that it would have been easy to have Kurt, an atheist, sing an anti-religion song, but instead chose to have him sing about love.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt; Critics disagreed over the appropriateness of this song choice.

She said that "Grilled Cheesus" felt forced and disliked Kurt's angry "overwrought" reaction to his friends' prayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2010/10/06/help-us-cheesus-we-didnt-love-glee/|title=Help us Cheesus, we didn't love 'Glee{{'-}}|last=Respers France|first=Lisa|work=CNN.com|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=October 6, 2010|accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christie Keith, writing for the lesbian and bisexual media website ''[[AfterEllen.com and AfterElton.com|AfterEllen.com]]'', praised Kurt's storylines and suggested that Colfer should win an Emmy Award for his portrayal of Kurt dealing with his identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterellen.com/tv/recaps/glee-2-04 |title={{-"}}Glee" Episode 204 Recap: "Don't Go Breakin' Kurt and Brittany's Hearts{{"-}} |last=Keith |first=Christie |work=[[AfterEllen.com and AfterElton.com|AfterEllen.com]] |publisher=[[Logo (TV channel)|Logo]] |date=October 13, 2010 |accessdate=October 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101016011923/http://www.afterellen.com/tv/recaps/glee-2-04 |archivedate=October 16, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics were polarized by Kurt's storyline in the episode "Never Been Kissed". ''[[NPR]]''{{'s}} [[Linda Holmes (writer)|Linda Holmes]] found it "absurd" that a teenager as deeply in denial as Karofsky would transition from bullying to kissing Kurt so quickly and described it as "emotionally and behaviorally unsound".&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2010/11/10/131212955/why-glee-missed-the-mark-with-the-much-hyped-never-been-kissed?ft=1&amp;f=93568166|title=How 'Glee' Missed The Mark With The Much-Hyped 'Never Been Kissed{{'-}}|first=Linda|last=Holmes|work=Monkey See|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=November 11, 2010|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leah Anthony Libresco of the ''[[The Huffington Post|Huffington Post]]'' called the episode "extraordinarily counterproductive", and disapproved of Will treating Kurt's upset as the key problem, rather than the unchecked bullying provoking it. She found Blaine's advice to Kurt "misleading and dangerous", especially the suggestion that targeted children should be held responsible for confronting their attackers and putting themselves at risk of further injury, rather than for protecting themselves.&lt;ref name="HP"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leah-anthony-libresco/glees-gay-suicide-psa-it_b_781815.html|title=Glee's Gay Suicide PSA: It Got Worse|first=Leah Anthony|last=Libresco|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=November 10, 2010|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poniewozik noted that the storyline was inherently flawed, as the show had previously treated bullying in a light-hearted rather than serious manner, but said that its saving grace was the focus it placed on Colfer: "probably the strongest actor with the most interesting character among the ''Glee'' kids".&lt;ref name="JP"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tunedin.blogs.time.com/2010/11/10/glee-watch-bully-pulpit/|title=Glee Watch: Bully Pulpit|first=James|last=Poniewozik|authorlink=James Poniewozik|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|date=November 10, 2010|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The love story involving Kurt and Blaine was met with critical acclaim, especially the events in the "Original Song" episode where the characters first kissed. Katie Morgan of ''Billboard'' stated, "It sure took them long enough, but we're so glad to finally see Kurt happy."&lt;ref name="Billboard"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/472501/glees-new-directions-blaine-and-kurt-score-big-at-regionals|title={{-'}}Glee's' New Directions, Blaine and Kurt Score Big at Regionals|last=Morgan|first=Katie|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=March 16, 2011|accessdate=March 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[The Boston Herald|Boston Herald]]''{{'s}} Mark Perigard wrote, "It was utterly, sweetly romantic, and Criss sold the hell out of the moment.

She went on to commend the acting in the scene, and wrote that both actors "handled it with dignity and honesty".&lt;ref name="MTV"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hollywoodcrush.mtv.com/2011/03/16/glee-recap-original-song/|title={{-'}}Glee' Recap: 'Original Song{{'-}}|last=Semigran|first=Aly|work=[[MTV]]|publisher=[[Viacom]]|date=March 16, 2011|accessdate=March 19, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/657oOSBy8?url=http://hollywoodcrush.mtv.com/2011/03/16/glee-recap-original-song/|archivedate=February 1, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics were enthusiastic about Kurt and Blaine's decision to have sex for the first time in "The First Time" episode. Canning said that Kurt and Blaine's "attempts to get a little wild", and "trying to grow up faster than they should", were "the better parts of the episode as they felt the most realistic".&lt;ref name="IGN-TheFirstTime"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/121/1212004p1.html |title=Glee: "The First Time" Review |last=Canning |first=Robert |date=November 9, 2011 |work=IGN |publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Futterman praised their departure from the bar as a "very faithful and honest scene".&lt;ref name="RS-TheFirstTime"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/glee-recap-the-first-time-tries-too-hard-20111109 |title={{-'}}Glee' Recap: 'The First Time' Tries Too Hard |last=Futterman |first=Erica |date=November 9, 2011 |work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Wenner Media LLC |accessdate=November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crystal Bell of ''[[HuffPost TV]]'' was impressed by the way the characters' relationship "inspires gay youth in a way that we haven't seen on network television yet" and called them "amazing role models for all teens", and ''The Atlantic'' writer Kevin Fallon said it was "remarkable" and a "milestone" that "the decision by gay teen characters to lose their virginities is given equal weight to that of a straight couple".&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/11/how-glee-got-teen-sex-right/248157/ |title=How 'Glee' Got Teen Sex Right |date=November 9, 2011 |last1=Fallon |first1=Kevin |work=The Atlantic |publisher=Atlantic Media Company|accessdate=November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''L'Enseigne de Gersaint''''', or '''''The Shop Sign of Gersaint''''', (1720–21)&lt;ref&gt;Craske, Matthew. (1997) ''Art in Europe 1700–1830: A History of the Visual Arts in an Era of Unprecedented Urban Economic Growth''. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], p. 175. {{ISBN|0192842064}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a painting by [[Jean-Antoine Watteau]], which is considered to be his last masterpiece. It was painted as a shop sign for the ''[[marchand-mercier]]'', or art dealer, [[Edme François Gersaint]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Germain Bazin|Bazin, Germain]]. (1964) ''Baroque &amp; Rococo''. Translated by Jonathan Griffin. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, p. 197. {{ISBN|0500200181}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Daniel Roche (historian)|Daniel Roche]] the sign functioned more as an advertisement for the artist than the dealer.&lt;ref&gt;Of the ''enseigne'', "Elle ne fait pas publicité de Gersaint, mais celle de Watteau", [[Daniel Roche (historian)|Daniel Roche]] observes in his preface to Guillaume Glorieux's monograph, ''À l'Enseigne de Gersaint: Edme-François Gersaint, marchand d'art sur le Pont Notre-Dame'', Paris, 2002; of Gersaint, Glorieux remarks at the outset, "immortalisé par le chef-d'oeuvre de Watteau, Gersaint est célèbre mais on ne sait presque rien de lui."&lt;/ref&gt; 

The painting exaggerates the size of Gersaint's cramped [[boutique]], hardly more than a permanent booth with a little [[backshop]], on the medieval [[Pont Notre-Dame]], in the heart of Paris, both creating and following fashion as he purveyed works of art and luxurious trifles to an aristocratic clientele.&lt;ref&gt;"Gersaint, faiseur de modes, suiveur de modes, est, d'une autre façon que Watteau, un créateur vrai", remarks Daniel Roche in his preface to Glorieux 2002:v.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
[[File:Gersaint-detail.jpg|thumb|The central couple watch the boxing up of Louis XIV]]
The picture was originally painted on one canvas, depicting clients and staff at the shop. As a worker packs away a portrait of [[Louis XIV]] at the left, in the centre a young man offers his hand to a woman who is stepping over the threshold of the shop. At the right an elderly couple examine a painting of nudes, and a pretty young shop assistant, possibly Gersaint's wife, shows a painting to a group of well-dressed young people. In its present form, the painting consists of two separate parts, the upper sections of them were added between 1720 and 1732 by an unknown painter to transform the painting from its original, arched shape into a rectangular field. Watteau probably painted the work in the spring of 1720 when the entire entrance facade of Gersaint's shop was rebuilt. According to the study by Vogtherr and Wenders de Calisse (2007) the painting had originally covered the round field above the entrance of the shop. These changes to the building were made in the spring of 1720, the most likely date for the painting.

The artworks in the painting are set alongside the actions of high-society criticism. The young man offering his hand to the woman in pink is set against a series of female nudes, while puritanical figures in portraits at the left seem to look down disapprovingly. At the right, there are numerous images of orgies and naked figures, implying that art expresses the hidden lustful feelings of the genteel figures in the shop, who merely gaze at one another or engage in polite gestures of intimacy.

Commonly, the painting is interpreted as a commentary on the shift in aristocratic culture – or relief – that occurred during the government of the more licentious ''Régent'' [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]] (1715–1723), after the death of [[Louis XIV]] and before the accession to the throne of [[Louis XV]]. The boxing of [[Pierre Mignard]]'s portrait of the deceased king implies the end of the old régime.

==Provenance==
The painting never actually functioned as an external shop sign, spending only fifteen days at the shop. Watteau himself asked Gersaint to allow him to paint it, complaining of "cold fingers" that needed some exercise.&lt;ref name = "tcw"&gt;T. C. W. Blanning, ''The Culture of Power and the Power of Culture: Old Regime Europe 1660–1789'', Oxford University Press, 2003, p.105.&lt;/ref&gt; It was soon bought by Claude Glucq. It was then acquired by Watteau's patron Jean de Jullienne.&lt;ref name = "tcw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Watteau, 1684–1721'', National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1984, p.450&lt;/ref&gt; An [[engraving]] was made in 1732 after a small version by Pater who extended Watteau's composition for the print. It attracted the attention of [[Frederick the Great]] of [[Prussia]]. He bought the painting in 1748 (at that time already in two separate parts) from the Dutch dealer Pieter Boetgens. It remained in Germany thereafter, now forming part of the collection of the Stiftung Preußische Schlösser und Gärten Berlin-Brandenburg that display it at the [[Charlottenburg Palace]], [[Berlin]] where it had first been displayed in 1748.

'''Lao ceramics''' refers to [[ceramic art]] and [[pottery]] designed or produced as a form of [[Lao art]]. The tradition of Lao ceramics dates back to the third millennium BCE. Pottery and ceramics were an essential part of the trade between Laos and its neighbours.

== History ==
Ceramics were first uncovered in 1970 at a construction site at kilometer 3, Thadeua Road in the [[Vientiane]] area of the [[Mekong Valley]]. Construction was halted only temporarily, and the [[kiln]] was hastily and unprofessionally excavated over a one-month period. At least four more kilns have been identified since then, and surface evidence and topography indicate at least one hundred more in the Ban Tao Hai (Village of the Jar Kilns) vicinity. Archaeologists have labeled the area [[Sisattanak Kiln Site]]. 

According to Honda and Shimozu (The Beauty of Fired Clay: Ceramics from [[Burma]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], and [[Thailand]], 1997), the Lao kilns are similar to the Siamese types found at [[Suphanburi]] and [[Si Satchanalai]]. But Hein, Barbetti and Sayavongkhamdy (An Excavation at the Sisattanak Kiln Site, Vientiane, Lao P.D.R., 1989, 1992) say that the Lao kilns, which are of a cross-draft clay-slab type, differ substantially not only from the Siamese types but all other types in Southeast Asia. 

Because only one kiln, VS8, has been excavated, almost no questions regarding Lao ceramic tradition have been answered. The VS8 kiln though showed no evidence of brick construction. It had square chimney foundations, a narrow firebox, and was built partly above ground. 

The Sisattanak Kiln Site lies just outside Vientiane's first city walls, which are dated to the 15th century. Radiocarbon dating of the kiln gives a 15th-17th century timeframe, with an earlier period of that range most likely. This is supported by the evidence of surface finds, which suggest that area kilns at higher elevations show a greater ratio of glazed to unglazed wares. The theory is that the kilns were moved up over time and that more glazed wares were fired over time. This is supported by the ceramics uncovered at VS8, a lower-elevation site, which were all of a utilitarian and domestic nature. They included pipes, domestic wares and architectural fittings. 

The VS8 excavation uncovered both unglazed and glazed wares. Most of the glazed wares were pipes; 1,500 pipe fragments and complete pieces were collected. Their quality indicates a well-developed tradition, and their motifs suggest the possibility that they were export wares. 

From the examples collected to date, it can be said that Lao ceramics used one kind of clay, with 5% [[quartz]] added as a temper. Both the clay and the quartz were finely crushed. The glazed wares were a light, translucent green (like [[celadon]]) or various shades of brown. There have also been shards showing an olive-colored glaze, not unlike the type found in [[Thailand]]. 

Many of the glazed wares have ribbed or fluted exteriors, similar to that of the silver bowls ubiquitous in Laos, both the regular silver bowls ("oh tum") and the silver stem bowls ("khan"). Glazed ceramic stem bowls have been collected as surface finds at the Sisattanak Kiln Site. Decorations to glazed wares show a great measure of restraint, with simple incisions, stamps and fluting. Unglazed wares are similarly austere. They are generally not decorated with incisions or stamps, which are common in other Southeast Asian wares. 

The VS8 excavation in 1989 added to an ever-increasing body of evidence that Lao ceramic tradition is significant. Future excavations are expected to prove that Lao ceramic production was comparable to that of other countries in the region.

'''''Menin Gate at Midnight''''' (also known as '''''Ghosts of Menin Gate''''') is a [[1927 in art|1927]] painting by Australian artist [[Will Longstaff]]. The painting depicts a host of ghostly soldiers marching across a field in front of the [[Menin Gate]] war memorial.&lt;ref name="AWMEncyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|last=Grey|first=Anne|title=Menin Gate at Midnigh|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/articles/encyclopedia/menin|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is part of the collection of the [[Australian War Memorial]] in [[Canberra]].&lt;ref name="AWM Collection"&gt;{{cite web|title=ART09807 - Menin Gate at midnight|url=http://cas.awm.gov.au/item/ART09807|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=21 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630152957/http://cas.awm.gov.au/item/ART09807|archivedate=30 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longstaff painted the work after attending the unveiling of the Menin Gate memorial, at [[Ypres]] in Belgium, on 24 July 1927. The memorial commemorated those men of the [[British Empire]], including Australia, who died in the battles of the [[First World War]] around the town.&lt;ref name=AWMEncyclopedia /&gt; Walking around the streets of Ypres after the ceremony, Longstaff was said to have seen a "vision of steel-helmeted spirits rising from the moonlit cornfields around him".&lt;ref name=AWMEncyclopedia /&gt; Returning to London, Longstaff was reported to have painted the work in a single session, while "still under psychic influence".&lt;ref name=AWMEncyclopedia /&gt;

The painting was immediately popular. It was purchased by [[Lord Woolavington]] for 2,000 [[Guinea (British coin)|Guinea]]s and presented to the Australian government.&lt;ref name=AWMEncyclopedia /&gt; After a royal command viewing for [[George V]] and the Royal family at Buckingham Palace, the painting was displayed in Manchester and Glasgow. It was then taken around Australia, where record crowds paid to view the work. Longstaff oversaw the making of 2,000 prints and 400 of these were given to the nascent [[Australian War Memorial]] to sell to raise funds.&lt;ref name=AWMEncyclopedia /&gt;

The success of this work lead Longstaff to paint three later companion pieces with a similar ghostly, spiritualist theme:&lt;ref name=AWMEncyclopedia /&gt;
*''Immortal Shrine (Eternal Silence)'' &amp;ndash; showing ghostly soldiers marching past the [[Cenotaph#The Cenotaph, London|Cenotaph]] in London on [[Remembrance Day]]
*''Ghosts of Vimy Ridge'' (1931) &amp;ndash; depicting men of the [[Canadian Corps]] at [[Vimy Ridge]].
*''Carillon'' (1932) &amp;ndash; with New Zealand soldiers in Belgium hearing the bells in their native country.

{{nihongo|'''Nanban art'''|南蛮美術}} refers to [[Japanese art]] of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries influenced by contact with the {{nihongo|''Nanban''|南蛮}} or 'Southern barbarians', [[Nanban trade|traders]] and [[Kirishitan|missionaries]] from Europe and specifically from [[Portugal]]. It is a [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese word]], Chinese ''[[Nanman|Nánmán]]'', originally referring to the peoples of [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]].  During the [[Nanban trade period]], the word took on a new meaning when it came to designate the Portuguese, who first arrived  in 1543, and later other Europeans. The term also refers to paintings Europeans brought to [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="Namban"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Namban Art of Japan |author=Okamoto, Yoshitomo |publisher=[[Weatherhill]] |year=1972 |ISBN=0-8348-1008-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/n/nanbane.htm |title=Nanban-e |publisher=[[Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System]] |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Nanban art developed after the first Portuguese ships arrived in [[Kyushu]] in 1543. While Christian [[icons]] and other objects were produced, {{nihongo|Nanban [[byōbu]]|南蛮屏風}} or folding screens are particularly notable, with between 60 and 80 pairs surviving to this day&lt;ref name="Namban"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. Another popular area within Nanban art was the depiction of foreign warriors. Artists of the [[Kanō school]] were joined by those of the [[Tosa school]] in combining foreign subject matter with [[Japanese painting|Japanese styles of painting]]. Canons of western art of the period such as [[linear perspective]] and alternative materials and techniques appear to have had little lasting influence. The [[Persecution of Christians in Japan|persecution and prohibition of Christianity]] from the end of the sixteenth century and the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] policy of [[sakoku]] that largely closed Japan to foreign contact from the 1630s saw the decline of Nanban art.&lt;ref name="Namban"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JAANUS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/n/nanbanbyoubu.htm |title=Nanban-byoubu |publisher=[[Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System]] |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse influence==
While [[Japonism]] did not develop in the west until after the [[Bakumatsu|reopening of Japan]] in the 1850s and the 1860s, there is evidence of earlier Japanese influence in the art of [[Colonial Mexico]], as Japanese crafts were traded through the [[Manila Galleons]] from [[Manila]] (Philippines) to [[Acapulco]] (Mexico) from 1565 to 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Namban: Art in Viceregal Mexico |author=Lake, Rodrigo Rivero |publisher=Turner |year=2006 |ISBN=978-84-7506-693-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The torc is made from [[electrum]], an alloy of gold, silver and copper,&lt;ref name=AF&gt;{{cite web | title = The Newark Torc | publisher = [[The Art Fund]] | author =  | url = http://www.artfund.org/artwork/9795/the-newark-torc | access-date = 30 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; weighs 700 grammes (1.5&amp;nbsp;lbs)&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; and is 20&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.&lt;ref name=AF/&gt; The body is formed from rolled gold alloy wires, which had then been plaited into eight thin ropes then twisted together.

The reason for its deposition is uncertain, although Jeremy Hill, head of research at the British Museum, speculated that it might have been buried "possibly as an offering to the gods."&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt; "[It is] probably the most significant find of Iron Age Celtic gold jewellery made in the last 50 years ...

[[File:Newark torc 2.jpg|thumb|Another view]]

The torc has been dated to between 250 and 50 BC,&lt;ref name=AF/&gt; and is thought to have been buried in around 75 BC.&lt;ref name=DM/&gt;  The torc was found by Maurice Richardson, a [[Arborist|tree surgeon]], while he was metal detecting in a field.

The torc was declared [[treasure trove]] in 2005 and purchased in 2006 for Newark's Millgate Museum, with significant grant aid from the [[National Heritage Memorial Fund]].&lt;ref name=AF/&gt;&lt;ref name=NSCD&gt;{{cite web | title = Council Meeting 17th June 2008 Agenda Item No 12: Exhibition of the Newark Torc | publisher = [[Newark and Sherwood District Council]] | author = Sarah Dawes | date =  | url = http://www.newark-sherwooddc.gov.uk/ppimageupload/holding/Image68282.PDF | access-date = 30 November 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110613203008/http://www.newark-sherwooddc.gov.uk/ppimageupload/holding/Image68282.PDF | archivedate = 13 June 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The £350,000 proceeds were split between the finder and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], the landowner.&lt;ref name=DM/&gt;  The torc was displayed to the press on 18 November 2008 at the British Museum.&lt;ref name=DM/&gt;

{{original synthesis|article|date=March 2016}}

The '''open-source model''' is a decentralized [[software development]] model that encourages [[open collaboration]].&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Levine, Sheen S., &amp; Prietula, M. J. (2013). [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1096442 Open Collaboration for Innovation: Principles and Performance]. ''Organization Science'', {{doi|10.1287/orsc.2013.0872}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jo4hAQAAIAAJ|title=The cathedral and the bazaar: musings on Linux and Open Source by an accidental revolutionary|last=Raymond|first=Eric S.|publisher=OReilly|year=2001|isbn=978-0-596-00108-7|authorlink=Eric S. Raymond}}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A main principle of [[open-source software development]] is [[peer production]], with products such as source code, [[blueprint]]s, and documentation freely available to the public. The open-source movement in software began as a response to the limitations of proprietary code. The model is used for projects such as in [[open-source appropriate technology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Case for Open Source Appropriate Technology |journal=Environment, Development and Sustainability |volume=14 |issue= 3|pages=425–431 |year=2012 |doi=10.1007/s10668-012-9337-9 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1517361|last1=Pearce |first1=Joshua M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and open-source drug discovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/sreelatha-menon-researchers-sans-borders/00/19/350429/ "Science 2.0 is here as CSIR resorts to open-source drug research for TB" Business Standard, 1 March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://openwetware.org/wiki/OSDDMalaria:GSK_Arylpyrrole_Series:Story_so_far "Open Source Drug Discovery for Malaria Consortium]&lt;/ref&gt;

Open source promotes universal access via an [[open-source license|open-source]] or [[free license]] to a product's design or blueprint, and universal redistribution of that design or blueprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lakhani|first=K.R.|last2=von Hippel|first2=E.|year=June 2003|title=How Open Source Software Works: Free User to User Assistance|url=

''Open source'' gained hold with the rise of the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2004}}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[open-source software movement]] arose to clarify [[copyright]], [[License|licensing]], [[Domain name|domain]], and consumer issues.

Generally, open source refers to a [[computer program]] in which the [[source code]] is available to the general public for use or modification from its original design. Open-source code is meant to be a collaborative effort, where programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes within the community. Code is released under the terms of a [[software license]]. Depending on the license terms, others may then download, modify, and publish their version (fork) back to the community.

Many large formal institutions have sprung up to support the development of the open-source movement, including the [[Apache Software Foundation]], which supports community projects such as the open-source framework [[Apache Hadoop]] and the open-source [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] server [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache HTTP]].

==History==
{{main|History of free and open-source software}}The sharing of technical information predates the [[Internet]] and the personal computer considerably. For instance, in the early years of automobile development a group of capital [[monopoly|monopolists]] owned the rights to a [[2 cycle|2-cycle]] gasoline-engine patent originally filed by [[George B. Selden]].&lt;ref name="carculture"&gt;{{cite book |author=James J. Flink |title=The Car Culture |publisher=MIT Press |year=1977 |isbn=978-0-262-56015-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By controlling this patent, they were able to monopolize the industry and force car manufacturers to adhere to their demands, or risk a lawsuit.

In 1911, independent automaker [[Henry Ford]] won a challenge to the Selden patent. The result was that the Selden patent became virtually worthless and a new association (which would eventually become the [[Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association]]) was formed.&lt;ref name="carculture" /&gt; The new association instituted a cross-licensing agreement among all US automotive manufacturers: although each company would develop technology and file patents, these patents were shared openly and without the exchange of money among all the manufacturers.&lt;ref name="carculture" /&gt; By the time the US entered [[World War II]], 92 Ford patents and 515 patents from other companies were being shared among these manufacturers, without any exchange of money (or lawsuits).&lt;ref name="carculture" /&gt;

Early instances of the free sharing of source code include [[IBM]]'s source releases of its [[operating system]]s and other programs in the 1950s and 1960s, and the [[SHARE (computing)|SHARE]] user group that formed to facilitate the exchange of software.&lt;ref name="autogenerated172"&gt;{{cite book|title=IBM and the U.S. Data Processing Industry: An Economic History|last=Fisher|first=Franklin M.|publisher=Praeger|year=1983|isbn=978-0-03-063059-0|pages=172–9|author2=James W. McKie|author3=Richard B. Mancke}} IBM unbundled (began charging for) software 23 June 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.cozx.com/~dpitts/ibm7090.html Dave Pitts' IBM 7090 support] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827134534/http://www.cozx.com/~dpitts/ibm7090.html |date=2015-08-27 }}{{spaced ndash}}An example of distributed source: Page contains a link to [[IBM 7090/94 IBSYS]] source, including [[COBOL]] and [[FORTRAN]] compilers.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1960s, [[ARPANET]] researchers used an open "[[Request for Comments]]" (RFC) process to encourage feedback in early telecommunication network protocols. This led to the birth of the early Internet in 1969.

The sharing of source code on the Internet began when the Internet was relatively primitive, with software distributed via [[UUCP]], [[Usenet]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], and [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]]. [[BSD]], for example, was first widely distributed by posts to comp.os.linux on the Usenet, which is also where its development was discussed. [[Linux]] followed in this model.

=== Open source as a term ===
The term "open source" was first proposed by a group of people in the [[free software movement]] who were critical of the political agenda and moral philosophy implied in the term "free software" and sought to reframe the discourse to reflect a more commercially minded position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| publisher = Stanford University| last = O'Mahony| first = Siobhan Clare| title = The emergence of a new commercial actor: Community managed software projects| location = Stanford, CA| date = 2002|pages=34–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ambiguity of the term "free software" was seen as discouraging business adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html |title=Goodbye, "free software"; hello, "open source" |quote=The problem with it is twofold. First, ... the term "free" is very ambiguous ... Second, the term makes a lot of corporate types nervous.|author=[[Eric S. Raymond]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="infoworld1983"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yy8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=us%20government%20public%20domain%20software&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q=us%20government%20public%20domain%20software&amp;f=false |website=[[InfoWorld]] |date=1983-06-23|title=Free software - Free software is a junkyard of software spare parts |quote=''"In contrast to commercial software is a large and growing body of free software that exists in the public domain. Public-domain software is written by microcomputer hobbyists (also known as "hackers") many of whom are professional programmers in their work life. [...] Since everybody has access to source code, many routines have not only been used but dramatically improved by other programmers."'' |first=Tom |last=Shea |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The group included [[Christine Peterson]], [[Todd Anderson]], [[Larry Augustin]], [[Jon Hall (programmer)|Jon Hall]], [[Sam Ockman]], [[Michael Tiemann]] and [[Eric S. Raymond]]. Peterson suggested "open source" at a meeting&lt;ref name=osihistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensource.org/history |title=History of the OSI |date=19 September 2006 |first=Michael |last=Tiemann |authorlink=Michael Tiemann |publisher=[[Open Source Initiative]] |accessdate=23 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021001164015/http://www.opensource.org/docs/history.php |archivedate=1 October 2002 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; held at [[Palo Alto, California]], in reaction to [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]]'s announcement in January 1998 of a source code release for [[Netscape Navigator|Navigator]]. [[Linus Torvalds]] gave his support the following day, and Phil Hughes backed the term in ''[[Linux Journal]]''. [[Richard Stallman]], the founder of the free software movement, initially seemed to adopt the term, but later changed his mind.&lt;ref name=osihistory/&gt;&lt;ref name="rmsdissent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html |title=Why Open Source misses the point of Free Software |publisher=fsf.org |date=2012-05-18 |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netscape released its source code under the [[Netscape Public License]] and later under the [[Mozilla Public License]].&lt;ref name="Muffatto000"&gt;{{cite book  | title = Open Source: A Multidisciplinary Approach  | first = Moreno  | last = Muffatto  | publisher = Imperial College Press  | year = 2006  | isbn = 978-1-86094-665-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raymond was especially active in the effort to popularize the new term. He made the first public call to the free software community to adopt it in February 1998.&lt;ref name="raymondCall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html |title=Goodbye, "free software"; hello, "open source" |publisher=Catb.org |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, he founded The [[Open Source Initiative]] in collaboration with [[Bruce Perens]].&lt;ref name=osihistory/&gt;

The term gained further visibility through an event organized in April 1998 by technology publisher [[Tim O'Reilly]]. Originally titled the "Freeware Summit" and later known as the "Open Source Summit",&lt;ref name=opensourcesummit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linuxgazette.net/issue28/rossum.html |title=Open Source Summit |website=Linux Gazette |date=1998-04-10 |accessdate=2015-02-07 |first=Guido |last=van Rossum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229053622/http://linuxgazette.net/issue28/rossum.html |archivedate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the event was attended by the leaders of many of the most important free and open-source projects, including Linus Torvalds, [[Larry Wall]], [[Brian Behlendorf]], [[Eric Allman]], [[Guido van Rossum]], [[Michael Tiemann]], [[Paul Vixie]], [[Jamie Zawinski]], and Eric Raymond. At that meeting, alternatives to the term "free software" were discussed. Tiemann argued for "sourceware" as a new term, while Raymond argued for "open source". The assembled developers took a vote, and the winner was announced at a press conference the same evening.&lt;ref name=opensourcesummit /&gt;

"Open source" has never managed to entirely supersede the older term "free software", giving rise to the combined term [[free and open-source software]] (FOSS).

==Economics==

Some economists agree that open-source is an [[information good]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The economics and management of intellectual property : towards intellectual capitalism|last=Granstrand|first=Ove|publisher=E.

The cost of reproducing the work is low enough that additional users may be added at zero or near zero cost{{spaced ndash}}this is referred to as the [[marginal cost]] of a product. [[Copyright]] creates a monopoly so the price charged to consumers can be significantly higher than the marginal cost of production. This allows the author to recoup the cost of making the original work. Copyright thus creates access costs for consumers who value the work more than the marginal cost but less than the initial production cost. Access costs also pose problems for authors who wish to create a [[derivative work]]—such as a copy of a software program modified to fix a bug or add a feature, or a [[remix]] of a song—but are unable or unwilling to pay the copyright holder for the right to do so.

Being organized as effectively a "[[consumers' cooperative]]", open source eliminates some of the access costs of consumers and creators of derivative works by reducing the restrictions of copyright. Basic economic theory predicts that lower costs would lead to higher consumption and also more frequent creation of derivative works.  Organizations such as [[Creative Commons]] host websites where individuals can file for alternative "licenses", or levels of restriction, for their works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/ |title=About The Licenses |publisher=Creative Commons |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These self-made protections free the general society of the costs of policing copyright infringement.

Others argue that since consumers do not pay for their copies, creators are unable to recoup the initial cost of production and thus have little economic incentive to create in the first place. By this argument, consumers would lose out because some of the goods they would otherwise purchase would not be available. In practice, content producers can choose whether to adopt a proprietary license and charge for copies, or an open license. Some goods which require large amounts of professional research and development, such as the [[pharmaceutical industry]] (which depends largely on [[patent]]s, not copyright for intellectual property protection) are almost exclusively proprietary, although increasingly sophisticated technologies are being developed on open-source principles.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Pearce, ''[[Open-Source Lab (book)|Open-Source Lab]]: How to Build Your Own Hardware and Reduce Research Costs'', Elsevier, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that open-source development creates enormous value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://3dprintingindustry.com/2015/02/02/3d-printed-open-hardware-syringe-pump-value-800m/ 3D Printed Open Hardware Syringe Yields $800M Value, Study Finds]- ''3D Printing Industry'' 2-2-2015&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the context of [[open-source hardware]] design, digital designs are shared for free and anyone with access to digital manufacturing technologies (e.g. [[RepRap]] 3D printers) can replicate the product for the cost of materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wittbrodt | first1 = B.T. | last2 = Glover | first2 = A.G. | last3 = Laureto | first3 = J. | last4 = Anzalone | first4 = G.C. | last5 = Oppliger | first5 = D. | last6 = Irwin | first6 = J.L. | last7 = Pearce | first7 = J.M. | year = 2013 | title = Life-cycle economic analysis of distributed manufacturing with open-source 3-D printers | url = | journal = Mechatronics | volume = 23 | issue = 6| pages = 713–726 | doi = 10.1016/j.mechatronics.2013.06.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original sharer may receive feedback and potentially improvements on the original design from the [[peer production]] community.

===Licensing alternatives===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Smart phones.jpg|thumb|125px|Google Android operating system]] --&gt;
Alternative arrangements have also been shown to result in good creation outside of the proprietary license model. Examples include:{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

*[[File:Wikipedia-logo-en-big.png|thumb|125px|Wikipedia is an example of a global application of the open source model.]]Creation for its own sake – For example, [[Wikipedia]] editors add content for recreation. Artists have a drive to create. Both communities benefit from free starting material.
* Voluntary after-the-fact donations – used by [[shareware]], [[street performer]]s, and [[public broadcasting]] in the United States.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* Patron – For example, [[open access]] publishing relies on institutional and government funding of research faculty, who also have a professional incentive to publish for reputation and career advancement. Works of the U.S. federal government are automatically released into the [[public domain]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* [[Freemium]] – Give away a limited version for free and charge for a premium version (potentially using a [[dual license]]).
* Give away the product and charge something related – Charge for support of open-source [[enterprise software]], give away music but charge for concert admission.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* Give away work in order to gain market share – Used by artists, in corporate software to spoil a dominant competitor (for example in the [[browser wars]] and the [[Android operating system]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* For own use – Businesses or individual software developers often create software to solve a problem, bearing the full cost of initial creation. They will then open source the solution, and benefit from the improvements others make for their own needs. Communalizing the maintenance burden distributes the cost across more users; [[free rider problem|free riders]] can also benefit without undermining the creation process.

==Open-source applications==
[[File:121212 2 OpenSwissKnife.png|thumb|Open-source model application domains]]
Social and political views have been affected by the growth of the concept of open source. Advocates in one field often support the expansion of open source in other fields. But [[Eric Raymond]] and other founders of the [[open-source movement]] have sometimes publicly argued against speculation about applications outside software, saying that strong arguments for software openness should not be weakened by overreaching into areas where the story may be less compelling. The broader impact of the open-source movement, and the extent of its role in the development of new information sharing procedures, remain to be seen.

The [[open-source movement]] has inspired increased [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]] and liberty in [[biotechnology]] research, for example by [http://Therapoid.net/ open therapeutics] and [[CAMBIA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambia.org/daisy/cambia/470.html |title='Open-Source Practices for Biotechnology' — Cambia — Enabling Innovation |publisher=Cambia |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the research methodologies themselves can benefit from the application of open-source principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearce|first=Joshua M.|title=Open Source Research in Sustainability|journal=Sustainability: The Journal of Record|date=1 August 2012|volume=5|issue=4|pages=238–243|doi=10.1089/sus.2012.9944}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also given rise to the rapidly-expanding [[open-source hardware]] movement.

[[File:OK LOGO COLOUR RGB.svg|thumb|125px|[[Open Knowledge Foundation]] logo]]
* Open-content projects organized by the Wikimedia Foundation – Sites such as Wikipedia and Wiktionary have embraced the open-content [[Creative Commons]] content licenses. These licenses were designed to adhere to principles similar to various open-source software development licenses. Many of these licenses ensure that content remains free for re-use, that source documents are made readily available to interested parties, and that changes to content are accepted easily back into the system. Important sites embracing open-source-like ideals are [[Project Gutenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ |title=Project Gutenberg — free ebooks |publisher=Gutenberg.org |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wikisource]], both of which post many books on which the copyright has expired and are thus in the [[public domain]], ensuring that anyone has free, unlimited access to that content.

==Society and culture==
{{disputed section|date=December 2016}}
The rise of open-source culture in the 20th century resulted from a growing tension between creative practices that involve require access to content that is often [[copyright]]ed, and restrictive intellectual property laws and policies governing access to copyrighted content. The two main ways in which intellectual property laws became more restrictive in the 20th century were extensions to the term of copyright (particularly in the [[United States]]) and penalties, such as those articulated in the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), placed on attempts to circumvent anti-piracy technologies.&lt;ref name="copyright1998"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf |title=The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 |format=PDF |date = December 1998|author = US Copyright Office |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although artistic appropriation is often permitted under [[fair use|fair-use]] doctrines, the complexity and ambiguity of these doctrines creates an atmosphere of uncertainty among cultural practitioners. Also, the protective actions of copyright owners create what some call a "[[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effect]]" among cultural practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chillingeffects.org/ |title=Chilling Effects Clearinghouse |publisher=Chillingeffects.org |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of an "open-source" culture runs parallel to "[[Free Culture movement|Free Culture]]," but is substantively different. ''Free culture'' is a term derived from the [[free software movement]], and in contrast to that vision of culture, proponents of open-source culture (OSC) maintain that some intellectual property law needs to exist to protect cultural producers. Yet they propose a more nuanced position than corporations have traditionally sought. Instead of seeing intellectual property law as an expression of instrumental rules intended to uphold either natural rights or desirable outcomes, an argument for OSC takes into account diverse goods (as in "the Good life") and ends.

Sites such as [[ccMixter]] offer up free web space for anyone willing to license their work under a [[Creative Commons]] license. The resulting cultural product is then available to download free (generally accessible) to anyone with an Internet connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Open source software development – Just another case of collective invention?|url=http://ccmixter.org/about|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fccmixter.org%2Fabout&amp;date=2011-12-22|archivedate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older analog technologies such as the [[telephone]] or [[television]] have limitations on the kind of interaction users can have.

Through various technologies such as [[peer-to-peer]] networks and [[blogs]], cultural producers can take advantage of vast [[social networks]] to distribute their products. As opposed to traditional media distribution, redistributing digital media on the Internet can be virtually costless. Technologies such as [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] and [[Gnutella]] take advantage of various characteristics of the Internet protocol ([[TCP/IP]]) in an attempt to totally decentralize file distribution.

{{further|Open-source software movement}}

===Government===
* [[Open politics]] (sometimes known as ''Open-source politics'') is a political process that uses Internet technologies such as blogs, email and polling to provide for a rapid feedback mechanism between political organizations and their supporters. There is also an alternative conception of the term ''Open-source politics'' which relates to the development of public policy under a set of rules and processes similar to the open-source software movement.
* [[Open-source governance]] is similar to open-source politics, but it applies more to the democratic process and promotes the freedom of information.
* The [[South Korean government]] wants to increase its use of free and open-source software, in order to decrease its dependence on proprietary software solutions. It plans to make open standards a requirement, to allow the government to choose between multiple operating systems and web browsers. Korea's Ministry of Science, ICT &amp; Future Planning is also preparing ten pilots on using open-source software distributions.&lt;ref&gt;https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/osor/news/south-korean-government-switch-open-source&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
Open-source ethics is split into two strands:
* Open-source ethics as an ethical school – Charles Ess and David Berry are researching whether ethics can learn anything from an open-source approach. Ess famously even defined the [[Association of Internet Researchers|AoIR]] Research Guidelines as an example of open-source ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flosshub.org/sites/flosshub.org/files/berry2.pdf Berry (2004) Internet Ethics: Privacy, Ethics and Alienation{{spaced ndash}}An Open Source Approach.] (PDF file)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Open-source ethics as a professional body of rules – This is based principally on the computer ethics school, studying the questions of ethics and professionalism in the computer industry in general and software development in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=El-Emam, K |title=Ethics and Open Source |journal=Empirical Software Engineering |volume=6 |issue=4 |year=2001 |url=http://springerlink.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?wasp=hf0bld3qlk0unn8f8x2m&amp;referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,2,12;journal,14,33;linkingpublicationresults,1:100262,1#ContactOfAuthor1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Irish philosopher Richard Kearney has used the term "open-source Hinduism" to refer to the way historical figures such as Mohandas Gandhi and Swami Vivekananda worked upon this ancient tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Kearney |title=Anatheism: Returning to God After God |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BRiTJ_6JFYYC&amp;pg=PR13 |year=2011 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-14789-7 |page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
[[Open-source journalism]] formerly referred to the standard journalistic techniques of news gathering and fact checking, reflecting ''[[open-source intelligence]]'', a similar term used in military intelligence circles. Now, ''open-source journalism'' commonly refers to forms of innovative publishing of [[online journalism]], rather than the sourcing of news stories by a professional journalist. In the 25 December 2006 issue of TIME magazine this is referred to as [[user generated content|user created content]] and listed alongside more traditional open-source projects such as [[OpenSolaris]] and [[Linux]].

[[Blog|Weblogs]], or blogs, are another significant platform for open-source culture. Blogs consist of periodic, reverse chronologically ordered posts, using a technology that makes webpages easily updatable with no understanding of design, code, or [[file transfer]] required. While corporations, political campaigns and other formal institutions have begun using these tools to distribute information, many blogs are used by individuals for personal expression, political organizing, and socializing. Some, such as [[LiveJournal]] or [[WordPress]], utilize open-source software that is open to the public and can be modified by users to fit their own tastes. Whether the code is open or not, this format represents a nimble tool for people to borrow and re-present culture; whereas traditional websites made the illegal reproduction of culture difficult to regulate, the mutability of blogs makes "open sourcing" even more uncontrollable since it allows a larger portion of the population to replicate material more quickly in the public sphere.

[[Messageboards]] are another platform for open-source culture. Messageboards (also known as discussion boards or forums), are places online where people with similar interests can congregate and post messages for the community to read and respond to. Messageboards sometimes have moderators who enforce community standards of etiquette such as banning users who are [[spamming|spammers]]. Other common board features are private messages (where users can send messages to one another) as well as chat (a way to have a real time conversation online) and image uploading. Some messageboards use [[phpBB]], which is a free open-source package. Where blogs are more about individual expression and tend to revolve around their authors, messageboards are about creating a conversation amongst its users where information can be shared freely and quickly. Messageboards are a way to remove intermediaries from everyday life—for instance, instead of relying on commercials and other forms of advertising, one can ask other users for frank reviews of a product, movie or CD. By removing the cultural middlemen, messageboards help speed the flow of information and exchange of ideas.

[[OpenDocument]] is an [[open format|open]] [[document file format]] for saving and exchanging editable office documents such as text documents (including memos, reports, and books), [[spreadsheet]]s, charts, and presentations. Organizations and individuals that store their data in an open format such as OpenDocument avoid being [[Vendor lock-in|locked into]] a single software vendor, leaving them free to switch software if their current vendor goes out of business, raises their prices, changes their software, or changes their [[software license|licensing]] terms to something less favorable.

[[Open-source film|Open-source movie production]] is either an open call system in which a changing crew and cast collaborate in movie production, a system in which the end result is made available for re-use by others or in which exclusively open-source products are used in the production. The 2006 movie [[Elephants Dream]] is said to be the "world's first open movie",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elephantsdream.org/ |title=Elephants Dream |publisher=Elephants Dream |date=2006-08-13 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; created entirely using [[open-source technology]].

An open-source documentary film has a production process allowing the open contributions of archival material [[footage]], and other filmic elements, both in unedited and edited form, similar to crowdsourcing. By doing so, on-line contributors become part of the process of creating the film, helping to influence the editorial and visual material to be used in the documentary, as well as its thematic development. The first open-source documentary film is the non-profit "[[The American Revolution]]", which went into development in 2006, and will examine the role media played in the cultural, social and political changes from 1968 to 1974 through the story of radio station WBCN-FM in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;"Web Power to the People," The Boston Herald, 29 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Glory Days of the Rock of Boston," Boston Globe, Op-Ed, 18 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'BCN Documentary Looks for Archival Contributors," Boston Herald, 11 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"WBCN and The American Revolution," The Huffington Post, 11 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The film is being produced by Lichtenstein Creative Media and the non-profit Filmmakers Collaborative. Open Source Cinema is a website to create Basement Tapes, a feature documentary about copyright in the digital age, co-produced by the National Film Board of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca |title=Watch Documentaries and Animated Films Online |publisher=NFB.ca |date=2012-08-27 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Open-source film|Open-source film-making]] refers to a form of film-making that takes a method of idea formation from open-source software, but in this case the 'source' for a filmmaker is raw unedited footage rather than programming code. It can also refer to a method of film-making where the process of creation is 'open' i.e. a disparate group of contributors, at different times contribute to the final piece.

[[Open-IPTV]] is [[IPTV]] that is not limited to one recording studio, production studio, or cast. Open-IPTV uses the Internet or other means to pool efforts and resources together to create an online community that all contributes to a show.

===Education===
[[File:Global Open Educational Resources Logo.svg|thumb|125px|[[Open Educational Resources]] logo]]
Within the academic community, there is discussion about expanding what could be called the "intellectual commons" (analogous to the [[Creative Commons]]). Proponents of this view have hailed the [[OpenStax CNX|Connexions]] Project at [[Rice University]], [[MIT OpenCourseWare|OpenCourseWare]] project at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Eugene Thacker]]'s article on "open-source DNA", the "Open Source Cultural Database", [[Salman Khan (educator)|Salman Khan]]'s [[Khan Academy]] and [[Wikipedia]] as examples of applying open source outside the realm of computer software.

[[Open-source curriculum|Open-source curricula]] are instructional resources whose digital source can be freely used, distributed and modified.

Another strand to the academic community is in the area of research. Many funded research projects produce software as part of their work. There is an increasing interest in making the outputs of such projects available under an open-source license. In the UK the [[Jisc|Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)]] has developed a policy on open-source software. JISC also funds a development service called [[OSS Watch]] which acts as an advisory service for higher and further education institutions wishing to use, contribute to and develop open-source software.

On 30 March 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which included $2 billion over four years to fund the [[TAACCCT|TAACCCT program]], which is described as "the largest OER (open education resources) initiative in the world and uniquely focused on creating curricula in partnership with industry for credentials in vocational industry sectors like manufacturing, health, energy, transportation, and IT".&lt;ref&gt;http://openeducation2013.sched.org/event/23553161b01967fd7ff58eea22ce24b2#.U_qxw2Mpft8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innovation communities===
The principle of sharing pre-dates the open-source movement; for example, the free sharing of information has been institutionalized in the scientific enterprise since at least the 19th century. Open-source principles have always been part of the scientific community. The sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] described the four basic elements of the community—universal ism (an international perspective), communal ism (sharing information), disinterestedness (removing one's personal views from the scientific inquiry) and organized skepticism (requirements of proof and review) that accurately describe the scientific community today.

These principles are, in part, complemented by US law's focus on protecting expression and method but not the ideas themselves. There is also a tradition of publishing research results to the scientific community instead of keeping all such knowledge proprietary. One of the recent initiatives in scientific publishing has been [[Open access (publishing)|open access]]—the idea that research should be published in such a way that it is free and available to the public. There are currently many open access journals where the information is available free online, however most journals do charge a fee (either to users or libraries for access). The [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]] is an international effort with the goal of making all research articles available free on the Internet.

The [[National Institutes of Health]] has recently proposed a policy on "Enhanced Public Access to NIH Research Information". This policy would provide a free, searchable resource of NIH-funded results to the public and with other international repositories six months after its initial publication. The NIH's move is an important one because there is significant amount of public funding in scientific research. Many of the questions have yet to be answered—the balancing of profit vs. public access, and ensuring that desirable standards and incentives do not diminish with a shift to open access.

Farmavita.Net is a community of pharmaceuticals executives that has recently proposed a new business model of open-source pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farmavita.net/content/view/336/84/ |title=Pharmaceutical Licensing Network — Open Source Pharmaceuticals — New Business Model |publisher=Farmavita.Net |date=2007-01-12 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is targeted to development and sharing of know-how for manufacture of essential and life-saving medicines. It is mainly dedicated to the countries with less developed economies where local pharmaceutical research and development resources are insufficient for national needs. It will be limited to generic (off-patent) medicines with established use. By definition, a medicinal product has a "well-established use" if is used for at least 15 years, with recognized efficacy and an acceptable level of safety. In that event, the expensive clinical test and trial results could be replaced by appropriate scientific literature.

[[Benjamin Franklin]] was an early contributor eventually donating all his inventions including the [[Franklin stove]], [[bifocals]], and the [[lightning rod]] to the public domain.

New NGO communities are starting to use the open-source technology as a tool. One example is the Open Source Youth Network started in 2007 in Lisboa by ISCA members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isca-web.org/english/youth/yource/thenetwork] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319051530/http://www.isca-web.org/english/youth/yource/thenetwork|date=19 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Open innovation]] is also a new emerging concept which advocate putting R&amp;D in a common pool. The [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] platform is openly presenting itself as an Open innovation network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/membersminutes/20070920MembersMeeting/07.09.12-Eclipse-Open-Innovation.pdf |title=Eclipse|publisher=Eclipse.org|accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts and recreation===
Copyright protection is used in the performing arts and even in athletic activities. Some groups have attempted to remove copyright from such practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogaunity.org |title=Open Source Yoga Unity — Home |publisher=Yogaunity.org |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Russian music composer, scientist and [[Russian Pirate Party]] member Victor Argonov presented detailed raw files of his electronic opera "2032"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://argonov.ru/2032.html |title=Техно-опера "2032: Легенда о несбывшемся грядущем" |publisher=Argonov.ru |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; under free license [[Creative Commons license|CC-BY-NC 3.0]]. This opera was originally composed and published in 2007 by Russian label [[MC Entertainment]] as a commercial product, but then the author changed its status to free. In his blog [http://argonov.livejournal.com] he said that he decided to open raw files (including wav, midi and other used formats) to the public in order to support worldwide pirate actions against [[SOPA]] and [[Personal Information Protection Act|PIPA]]. Several Internet resources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muznews.rockzvuk.com/news/pervaja_v_mire_muzykalnaja_opera_s_otkrytymi_iskhodnikami/2012-01-25-202 |title=Первая в мире музыкальная опера с открытыми исходниками — 25 Января 2012 — Новости музыки и шоубизнеса |publisher=Muznews.rockzvuk.com |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linux.org.ru/forum/talks/7294092 |title=Музыкальная опера "2032" становится opensource — Talks — Форум|publisher=Linux.org.ru |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://netskop.ru/kulmztura/news_2012-01-19-16-40-02-974.html |title=Первая в мире музыкальная опера с открытыми исходниками |publisher=Netskop.ru |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; called "2032" the first open-source musical opera in history.

=== Ideologically-related movements ===
The [[open access|open-access movement]] is a movement that is similar in ideology to the open source movement.

'''Patrick Swift''' (1927–1983) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] painter who worked in Dublin, [[London]] and [[Algarve]] in southern [[Portugal]].

== Overview ==
In Dublin he formed part of the [[Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art|Envoy]] arts review / McDaid's pub circle of artistic and literary figures.&lt;ref&gt;A circle that included [[Patrick Kavanagh]], [[Anthony Cronin]] and [[Brendan Behan]].&lt;/ref&gt; In London he moved into the [[Soho]] bohemia where, with the poet [[David Wright (poet)|David Wright]], he founded and co-edited [[X (magazine)|''X'' magazine]]. In Portugal he continued painting while also writing and illustrating books on Portugal and founding [[Porches Pottery (Olaria Algarve)|Porches Pottery]], which revived a dying industry. During his lifetime Swift had only two solo exhibitions. His first exhibition at the Waddington Gallery, Dublin, in 1952 was well acclaimed. For Swift, however, his art seems to have been a personal and private matter.&lt;ref&gt;"Throughout his years in London, when he was right at the nerve centre of its art and literary life, he showed little interest in exhibiting his work." — Brian Fallon, "Patrick Swift and Irish Art", ''Patrick Swift: An Irish Painter in Portugal'', Gandon Editions, 2001(first published: Portfolio 2 - Modern Irish Arts Review, Gandon Editions, Cork, 1993); "Lucian Freud asks me if he is going to show in the new London Waddington’s, I answer that I did not think so, that I do not think he is interested in exhibiting his paintings. We are both puzzled." — Anthony Cronin, ''Patrick Swift 1927-83'', Gandon Editions Biography, 1993; "And one day I found him in his underground flat in Westbourne Terrace busily taking down all his canvases (or rather hardboards, for in those days he couldn’t afford canvas) from the walls and stowing them away in a cellar. His reason was: a millionaire art fancier had rung up to say he was calling and Swift did not want him to buy, or so much as see, his work." — David Wright, ''Patrick Swift 1927-83'', Gandon Editions, 1993; "In the world in which we all moved at that time, I used to be curious as to the detachment Paddy showed to the market place, at his indifference to the fashionable galleries where Freud and Bacon were the beckoning lights, along with Frank Auerbach; it was as if he'd taken Joyce's Stephen Daedalus to heart — that once the work is created, it is no longer anything to do with the artist, who simply stands aside and pares his nails." — [[Martin Green (author)|Martin Green]], ''Patrick Swift 1927-83'', Gandon Editions, 1993;  "Many people assumed he had stopped painting altogether" — Brian Fallon, "The fall and rise of Patrick Swift", ''The Irish Times'', 11 June 1992&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 the [[Irish Museum of Modern Art]] held a retrospective of Swift's work.

==Work==

He was a [[figurative art|figurative]] painter. ([[Aidan Dunne]]: "He was a [[Representation (arts)|representational]] artist through and through...Fidelity to visual experience above all."&lt;ref&gt;"He was a representational artist through and through, in the Kokoschka mould. Fidelity to visual experience above all." — Aidan Dunne, "The lost hope of Irish art", The ''Sunday Tribune'', 28 November 1993&lt;/ref&gt;) Though his style changed considerably over the years, his essential personality as an artist never did. He was plainly not interested in the formalist aspects of Modernism. He wanted art to have an expressive, emotive, even psychological content, though not in any literary sense.&lt;ref&gt;"Though his style changed considerably over the years, his essential personality as an artist never did. He was plainly not interested in the formalist aspects of Modernism... He wanted art to have an expressive, emotive, even psychological content, though not in any literary sense."— Brian Fallon,"Patrick Swift and Irish Art" (1993), ''Patrick Swift: An Irish Painter in Portugal'', Gandon Editions, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Cronin]]: "He was never in any doubt that painting was a re-creation of what the painter saw: in his own case at least not what the painter had seen or could imagine, but what he was actually looking at during the act of painting. A faithfulness of the sort was part of the bargain, part of his contract with his art… [which] had nothing to do with description…What was at stake was a faithful recreation of the truth to the artist of the experience, in the painter’s case the visual experience, the artist being admittedly only one witness, one accomplice during and after the fact. Of course this faithfulness did not rule out expressionist overtones. The truth was doubtless subjective as well as objective. Swift's blues and greys were usually properties of what he was painting. They were also part of his vision of things, properties of his mind. We felt then that time could only find its full expression through an art that was frugal, ascetic, puritanical even." &lt;ref name="Cronin"&gt;Irish Museum of Modern Art, 1993, Catalogue. Essays on Swift by Anthony Cronin (poet) and Aidan Dunne (art critic ): He was never in any doubt that painting was a re-creation of what the painter saw: in his own case at least not what the painter had seen or could imagine, but what he was actually looking at during the act of painting. A faithfulness of the sort was part of the bargain, part of his contract with his art… [which] had nothing to do with description…What was at stake was a faithful recreation of the truth to the artist of the experience, in the painter’s case the visual experience, the artist being admittedly only one witness, one accomplice during and after the fact. Of course this faithfulness did not rule out expressionist overtones. The truth was doubtless subjective as well as objective. Swift's blues and greys were usually properties of what he was painting. They were also part of his vision of things, properties of his mind. We felt then that time could only find its full expression through an art that was frugal, ascetic, puritanical even...In faraway Paris, Samuel Beckett felt the same thing, writing the trilogy that was to give asceticism, frugality, puritanisim and the bitter humour that lies at the heart of the joke that is life, their full expression. Swift's avoidance of warm colours... was born in that time and afterwards harked back to it&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he commented on art Swift never affiliated with any official or quasi-official art group or "style".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Ryan (Dublin artist)|John Ryan]] (founder of [[Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art|Envoy]]) in his introduction to Swift for the Rosc Catalogue 1971 (which included Swift's portrait of Kavanagh): "'He painted the trees and gardens he cherished and the people he loved; because he was, happily, not unduly concerned, a style that came naturally to him shortly became his own distinctive 'style' — his signature — as uniquely his own as the subject content. Swift's peculiar style reminds us of nobody but the artist — a telling point with a painter who has set no store on this aspect of the job. In Swift we have, then, a man with an observation that is both curious and affectionate — for his attention to details in his subject is paternal and not academic" - Rosc Catalogue, Irish Imagination, 1971; see also [http://www.adams.ie/BidCat/detail.asp?SaleRef=3074&amp;LotRef=94 Adams auctioneers catalogue notes]; and in ''Envoy'' (1951): "No clichés are employed to simplify his task and no tricks are superimposed to foster an illusion of originality. Academicians and abstractionists will equally deplore him, and probably for the same reasons. He has rejected the debased technique of the one and the dogmas of the other. He paints what he sees." — "Patrick Swift", by John Ryan, ''Envoy: A Review of Literature and Art'', July 1951, vol 5/20&lt;/ref&gt; He had three distinct "periods": Dublin, London, and Algarve.&lt;ref&gt;His early work in Dublin, where he used a thin paint surface, has a tense, spare, more-real-than-real quality. In London he became more expressive in his use of paint, applying thick layers of paint, using the brush more and "modelling" the paint surface. In the Algarve he continues this trend into a heavy, broken impasto and some of his later work verges on becoming abstract.&lt;/ref&gt; His work comprises [[portrait]]s, "tree portraits" (trees held a special fascination for Swift&lt;ref&gt;[[John McGahern]] (Swift drew his portrait in London in 1960) noted that he was fond of the line "those particular trees/ that caught you in their mysteries": "It was he who first told me how well Constable wrote in letters about trees, especially the plane trees, with their peeled strips of bark — ‘They soak up the polluted air' — and he quoted a favourite line, 'those particular trees/ that caught you in their mysteries’, mentioning that he preferred trees to flowers" ("The Bird Swift", ''Love Of The World'', John McGahern, Edited by Stanley van der Ziel, Faber &amp; Faber, 2009). Swift wrote in his Italian Notebook (Gandon Editions 1993): "I think that I probably have a real talent for painting trees if I developed it assiduously. I want to give them great density and depth pile heaps of detail into them and yet keep the sense of presence which is the whole point. I have started the painting of the palm tree outside the window. I can go straight at it because I have wanted to paint one for so long and have looked longingly into them so often in so many places". His later work is almost exclusively "tree portraits" and rural landscapes. [[Lima de Freitas]] (Gandon Editions 1993) writing about Swift's Algarve tree paintings: "Here his painting, which before had been sophisticated and ‘cultured’, was stripped bare and became a paean of praise, both voluptuous and sacred, to a perennial Spring. His exaltation bursts forth in a blaze of colour — like in Soutine, but a Soutine of happiness. He is intoxicated by a joy that casts away the erudite codes of style and revelled in the tangibility of the natural world. Impatiently, Patrick Swift searches out the roots of inner essence. A conjunction of opposites, of a characteristically fiery imagination and the cool verdure of plants and trees produced a kind of ‘naturalism' — but one which is the antithesis of timid conformity and mediocrity and could only have emerged from a process of rediscovering and reshaping a lost innocence... Patrick Swift’s paintings are an act of praise and wonder." Swift in 1952 also mentions "naturalism": "He sees an inevitable swing in modern art from surrealism to naturalism, but adds at once: 'It must be a purely visual and personal naturalism without the formulae of the academics.'"(AN IRISHMAN'S DIARY — QUIDNUNC, Seamus Kelly, ''The Irish Times'', 11 October 1952)
&lt;/ref&gt;), rural [[landscape]]s and urban landscapes. He worked in a variety of media including [[oil painting|oils]], [[watercolour]], [[pen|ink]], charcoal, [[lithography]] and [[ceramic art|ceramics]].

Swift regarded painting as "a deeply personal and private activity".&lt;ref&gt;"A more rewarding approach to painting, in my opinion the only valid one, is to regard it as a deeply personal and private activity" — Swift, "By Way of Preface", from a Report to the Committee of Cultural Relations, Dept of External Affairs, on a Year spent in Italy in the study of Art &amp; Painting, December 1955; "The Art of painting is itself an intensely personal activity. It may be labouring the obvious to say so but it is too little recognised in art journalism now that a picture is a unique and private event in the life of the painter: an object made alone with a man and a blank canvas... A real painting is something which happens to the painter once in a given minute; it is unique in that it will never happen again and in this sense is an impossible object. It is judged by the painter simply as a success or failure without qualification. And it is something which happens in life not in art: a picture which was merely the product of art would not be very interesting and could tell us nothing we were not already aware of." —  "The Painter in the Press", ''X'', October 1960. It could be added that Swift did not subscribe to the "idea of progress in the arts" (“Official Art and the Modern Painter”, ''X magazine'', November 1959), believing that "the mass of modern art theory that developed around the fantastic changes of this century's painting can be largely ignored."("Nano Reid", Envoy, March 1950)&lt;/ref&gt; (In 1952 ''The Irish Times'' noted that Swift's work was “intensely personal and strangely disturbing”.&lt;ref&gt;"...an atmosphere of heightened realism which… is intensely personal and strangely disturbing." — G.H.G. (usual signature for Tony Gray), ''The Irish Times'', 3 October 1952&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Biography==

===Dublin===
He was educated at [[Synge Street CBS]], a [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]] School in Dublin.  Although a self-taught&lt;ref&gt;"He was largely self taught (although, in any case, the kind of art teaching which Dublin offered at the time would merely have frustrated or enraged him)" — Brian Fallon, "Patrick Swift and Irish Art" (1993), ''Patrick Swift: An Irish Painter in Portugal'', Gandon Editions, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; artist he did attend night classes at the [[National College of Art and Design|National College of Art]] in 1946 &amp; 48 (under [[Sean Keating]]), freelanced in London in the late 1940s and attended the [[Académie de la Grande Chaumière|Grande Chaumière]] in Paris, where he met [[Alberto Giacometti|Giacometti]], in the summer of 1950. In the late 1940s he had a studio on [[Baggot Street]],&lt;ref&gt;"In the late forties and early fifties, there was a house in Lower Baggot Street, where rooms could be rented by the day or night for lectures, meetings, or for any other lawful purpose. Patrick Swift, the artist, had a flat in this house." — ''Brendan Behan'', Interviews and Recollections, Volume 1, E. H. Mikhail (editor), Gill and Macmillan (1982), p. 41 [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22patrick+swift%22+%22brendan+behan%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;safe=active Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1950-52 he set up his studio on Hatch Street.&lt;ref&gt;During this period he shared his board with his then girlfriend, the American poet Claire McAllister, Anthony Cronin and [[John S. Beckett]], Cousin of Samuel. Cronin: "John was Sam’s uncle James’s son, so he and Sam were first cousins, though in terms of age they could well have been uncle and nephew. John was a composer, a pianist and a harpsichordist. Portly and dark, he was quite unlike Sam in appearance but, as an artist himself and with a knowledge of painting as well as books and music, he was closer to him in spirit than the rest of the family. In Dublin he belonged to a circle which included Brendan Behan and Patrick Swift as well as the present writer." (Anthony Cronin, ''Samuel Beckett: The Last Modernist'', HarperCollins, 1996, p. 453)&lt;/ref&gt; Lucian Freud would share Swift's studio when he visited Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;"Freud had already shown in London and Paris when he came to Dublin in 1948 [most likely when Swift and Freud first met], partly on a pilgrimage to Jack B Yeats, who had just enjoyed a retrospective at the Tate; and whom Freud declared the greatest living painter… Freud seemed closest to artist Paddy Swift… In September 1951 [[Kitty Garman]] wrote to her mother… She mentions Freud working on a painting in Paddy Swift’s Hatch Street studio, ''Dead Cock’s Head 1951'', painted on the same red velvet chair as Swift’s ''Woodcock 1951''." — "Lucian Freud: Prophet of Discomfort", Mic Moroney, ''Irish Arts Review'' [http://academics.eckerd.edu/instructor/gliemde/AH319-001/handouts/British%20Art,%201760-1960/Lucien%20Freud,%20Prophet%20of%20Discomfort.pdf link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119192212/http://academics.eckerd.edu/instructor/gliemde/AH319-001/handouts/British%20Art,%201760-1960/Lucien%20Freud,%20Prophet%20of%20Discomfort.pdf |date=19 January 2012 }}; "He had met Freud by 1949... My grasp of chronology is not always accurate, but certainly the acquaintance was well-developed by 1950 when we shared the ground-floor of a house in Hatch Street together. Lucian, who was staying in Ireland, used to come around in the mornings to paint, so that sometimes when I would surface around ten or eleven I would find them both at work in the studio next door." — Anthony Cronin, ''Patrick Swift 1927-83'', 1993 IMMA Retrospective Catalogue. Freud's visits in the fifties coincided with his courtship of [[Lady Caroline Blackwood]]. Photographs by [[Daniel Farson]] from this period include Freud, Swift and Behan in Dublin in 1952([http://web.artprice.com/ps/artitem/?id=2562801 artprice.com link]).&lt;/ref&gt; He first exhibited professionally in group shows at the Irish Exhibition of Living Art in 1950 &amp; 51 where his work was singled out by critics.&lt;ref&gt;"Yet, while Swift may seem a ''rara avis'' in this artistic climate, he was less isolated in Irish art than he appears today... he belonged — insofar as a man so individualistic can belong to any specific trend — to a tendency which showed itself in the Living Art exhibitions of the early 1950s. It was in this context that Swift first made his mark, even before Waddington took him up." — [[Brian Fallon (critic)]], "Patrick Swift and Irish Art" (1993), ''Patrick Swift: An Irish Painter in Portugal'', Gandon Editions, 2001; "Patrick Swift had graduated from the National College of Art and immediately established himself as a significant painter with work shown at the Irish Exhibition of Living Art in 1950. In addition to painting, he had wide intellectual and literary interests." — ''Young John McGahern: Becoming a Novelist'', Denis Sampson, Oxford University Press, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Dublin Magazine]] commented on Swift’s "uncompromising clarity of vision which eschews the accidental or the obvious or the sentimental" and "shows his power to convey the full impact of the object, as though the spectator were experiencing it for the first time." In 1952 he held his first solo exhibition at the Waddington Galleries.

"Irish critics got a look at the work of a tousled young (25) man named Paddy Swift and tossed their caps in the air. Paddy's 30 canvases are as grey and gloomy as Dublin itself — harshly realistic paintings of dead birds and rabbits, frightened-looking girls and twisted potted plants. Their fascination is in the merciless, sharply etched details, as oppressive and inquiring as a back-room third degree. Dublin Understands. Wrote Critic Tony Gray in [[the Irish Times]]: Swift 'unearths [from his subjects] not a story, nor a decorative pattern, nor even a mood, but some sort of tension which is a property of their existence.' Said the [[The Irish Press|Irish Press]]: 'An almost embarrassing candor... Here is a painter who seems to have gone back to the older tradition and to have given the most searching consideration to the composition of his painting.' Dublin, which likes authors who write with a shillelagh, understood an artist who painted with one. The Word Is Tension. By 1950, Paddy was in Paris... Nights, he went to the galleries, and there he found what he wanted to do. He liked such old French masters as the 17th century's Nicolas Poussin, the 19th century's Eugène Delacroix, such moderns as Switzerland's Alberto Giacometti and Britain's Francis Bacon. The much-admired decorative style of the Matisses is not for Paddy Swift. 'Art,' he thinks, 'is obviously capable of expressing something more closely related to life than these elegant designs.' His main idea is to suggest the tensions he finds in life. 'I believe when you bring, say, a plant into a room, everything in that room changes in relation to it. This tension — tension is the only word for it — can be painted.'" This may have been Swift's only interview. A motif of his work at this time was his bird imagery, which appear to have symbolic overtones, and may have even been a subtle form of self-portraiture.&lt;ref&gt;"A motif of Swift's work at this time was his bird imagery, which appeared to him to have symbolic overtones, and may even have been a subtle form of self-portraiture. Certainly Seamus Kelly, in his 'Quidnunc' column a few days after the Waddington opening, noted that the artist himself resembled one of his own birds — beaknosed, sharp-eyed, wiry, with a kind of nervous, intense presence. The self-portrait mentioned bears this out, with its questioning, almost withdrawn look. This is the typical Irish artist-intellectual of the post-war years..." — [[Brian Fallon (critic)]], "Patrick Swift and Irish Art" (1993), ''Patrick Swift: An Irish Painter in Portugal'', Gandon Editions, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; From early on he was involved with literary magazines,&lt;ref&gt;"From early on Swift was associated with literary magazines..." — Brian Fallon, "The fall and rise of Patrick Swift", ''The Irish Times'', 11 June 1992&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[The Bell (magazine)|The Bell]] and ''Envoy'', contributing the occasional critical piece on art and artists he admired (e.g.[[Nano Reid]],&lt;ref&gt;"Nano Reid", by Patrick Swift, Envoy, March 1950;[http://painterpatrickswift.blogspot.com/1970/03/nano-reid-by-patrick-swift.html article]&lt;/ref&gt; who painted Swift's portrait in 1950). He formed part of the group of artists and writers who were involved with [[Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art|Envoy]]. Dublin portraits include [[Patrick Kavanagh]], [[Anthony Cronin]], [[John Jordan (poet)|John Jordan]], [[Patrick Pye]], and [[Julia O'Faolain]].&lt;ref&gt;''Trespassers: A Memoir'', Julia O'Faolain, Faber and Faber (2012), pp.128-130&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he also got to know the likes of [[Samuel Beckett]]&lt;ref&gt;Beckett had an extract from [[Watt (novel)|Watt]] appear in ''Envoy'' in 1950. Following his mother's funeral Beckett spent the afternoon with Swift in McDaid's, later to be joined by the rowdy Kavanagh &amp; O'Nolan (Gandon Editions Biography, 1993). Beckett was later to contribute to ''X Magazine'' with "L'Image", an extract from an early, variant version of ''[[How It Is|Comment c'est]]'' and the first appearance of the novel in any form ("'L’Image', X: A Quarterly Review, Vol. I, No. 1, November 1959.

Swift’s work is currently neglected but I have little doubt that it was the biggest factor in forming Edward’s own style, and Anthony Cronin agrees with me... [Edward’s widow, Sally, says] that he admitted the debt himself: ‘he always said that it was Swift who put him on the right road’. But exactly where they first met is impossible to say; both men are dead and Swift’s widow, Mrs Oonagh Swift, says she does not know the details of her late husband’s early life [-p.41]... [Cronin] is certain, however, that Freud came regularly in the summer of 1951, or possibly 1952, to a studio Patrick Swift had in Hatch Street. Is it possible that Edward had met Swift as early as this, and if so, did he encounter Freud there? [-p. 47]... His debt to Lucian Freud has been stressed, but the debt to Patrick Swift is less known, though Edward told Harriet Cooke in an interview for The Irish Times (17 April 1978): ‘Patrick Swift was instrumental in my starting to paint; Patrick Swift and Lucian Freud, they were both people I was in sympathy with.’[-p.73]" — ''Edward McGuire - RHA'', Brian Fallon, Irish Academic Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Waddington exhibition Swift moved to London in November 1952, using it as his base, with occasional trips to Dublin and stays in [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Oakridge, Gloucestershire|Oakridge]] and the [[Digswell Arts Trust]].

In 1954 he was awarded a grant by the Irish Cultural Relations Committee to study art in Italy. He was accompanied by his future wife, Oonagh Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;Sister of the artist [[John Ryan (Dublin artist)|John Ryan]]  and the Irish actress [[Kathleen Ryan]]; formerly married to [[Alexis Guedroitz]] with whom she had a daughter, [[Ania Guédroïtz]])&lt;/ref&gt; Following his year in Italy Swift returned to Dublin, via Paris and London, for Christmas 1955, where Oonagh wanted to be for the birth of their first child.&lt;ref&gt;[[Katherine Swift (artist)|Katherine Swift]]&lt;/ref&gt; He then returned to London in 1956 and accepted [[Elizabeth Smart (author)|Elizabeth Smart's]] offer to share Winstone Cottage (then owned by [[John Rothenstein]]), which contained a studio, in [[Oakridge, Gloucestershire]]. October 1958 – October 1959 he held a fellowship at the [[Digswell Arts Trust]], for a period sharing a studio with [[Michael Andrews (artist)|Michael Andrews]]. During his residency at Digswell he painted many views of [[Ashwell, Hertfordshire|Ashwell]] and its Springs, one of which was presented by Henry Morris to [[Melbourn Village College]] at its opening in 1959.

===London===
Swift was familiar with London and its literary and artistic circles by the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;He freelanced in London in the late 1940s and in the early 1950s he was a frequent visitor to London, occasionally staying with Freud&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 he shared a flat with Anthony Cronin in Camden but actually used it as his studio, staying instead with Oonagh in Hampstead — it was at this point that Swift and Wright first discussed the idea of creating a new literary magazine, a quarterly which would publish writing on artistic issues they felt to be of importance. 1957-58 he had a flat and studio in Eccleston Square. 1959-62 he lived in Westbourne Terrace ([[Elizabeth Smart (author)|Elizabeth Smart]] lived upstairs&lt;ref&gt;The house at Westbourne Terrace became a "mini-Soho": " The Flat at 9 Westbourne Terrace was itself a mini-Soho" — Antoinette Quinn, ''Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography'', Gill &amp; Macmillan, 2001; "On many occasions through the early Sixties, writers and painters such as David Gascoyne, Paddy Kavanagh, Roberts [[Robert MacBryde|MacBryde]] and [[Robert Colquhoun|Colquhoun]] and Paddy Swift would gather at Westbourne Terrace in [[Paddington]], our family home at that time. They came for editorial discussions about their poetry magazine, ''X''." — {{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/aug/20/poetry.features |title=Christopher Barker on his parents, George Barker and Elizabeth Smart&amp;#124; Books &amp;#124; The Observer |publisher=Guardian |date= 2006-08-20|accessdate=2009-12-01 | location=London}}; "In London Swift, almost inevitably, moved into the Soho bohemia which included Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud, George Barker, W.S. Graham, John Minton, William Crozier" — "The fall and rise of Patrick Swift", Brian Fallon, ''The Irish Times'', 11 June 1992&lt;/ref&gt;), and it was during this period that he founded ''X magazine''

In London his work grew more expressive. [[Brian Fallon (critic)|Brian Fallon]]: "In London his style changed, not immediately, but gradually and very thoroughly. In fact, it was less a stylistic change than a transformation. From being a painter with sharp, angular lines and a thin paint surface, he became one who ‘drew with the brush’. Modelled in heavy, laden strokes, and in general, daubed and dragged the paint around until it did his bidding. Stylistically, his ‘first period’ and ‘second period’ could hardly be more different from one another, though the underlying sensibility somehow remains."&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Fallon (critic)]], "Patrick Swift And Irish Art" (1993), ''Patrick Swift: An Irish Painter in Portugal'', Gandon Editions, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

London portraits include the poets [[George Barker (poet)|George Barker]], [[Patrick Kavanagh]], [[David Wright (poet)|David Wright]], [[Brian Higgins (poet)|Brian Higgins]], [[John Heath-Stubbs]], [[Paul Potts (writer)|Paul Potts]], [[C. H. Sisson]], and [[David Gascoyne]]. At the time Swift was sometimes referred to as the "poets' painter" — many of his close friends were poets and they seem to have regarded him as "their" painter. Apart from close family members, poets were almost exclusively subjects of his portraits.&lt;ref&gt;"...his ability to communicate certain truths on what one senses to be a deeply spiritual level. It is perhaps this quality in his work which links Swift with the world of poetry and poets. Apart from close family members, poets were almost exclusively subjects of his portraits; the series of poet portraits shown at IMMA [1993 Retrospective] are quite exceptional by any standards and must place him among the very best Irish painters of the twentieth century." — [https://www.jstor.org/pss/20492866 Wanda Ryan Smolin  (art historian and writer)  in the Irish Arts Review 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding these London portraits Fallon says, "once again, his approach was basically humanist, not formalist... [these London portraits] are among the finest portraits painted in Britain at this period... Yet they were seen by only a handful of people, and in some cases were even lucky to have survived."&lt;ref name="Brian Fallon 1993"&gt;Brian Fallon, "Patrick Swift and Irish Art" (1993), ''Patrick Swift: an Irish Painter in Portugal'', Gandon Editions, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962 Swift left London for an extended trip to southern Europe.

===Algarve===
Swift’s travels led him to the small [[fishing village]] of [[Carvoeiro (Lagoa)|Carvoeiro]] in the Algarve. He was so enchanted with the place that he remained. In Algarve he painted, wrote and illustrated books on Portugal and founded [[Porches Pottery (Olaria Algarve)]]. He designed the building that houses Porches Pottery, along with several other buildings.&lt;ref&gt;He instructed in the restoration of a 17th-century building that today is the O Leão de Porches restaurant, designing the interior; he designed the Rouxinol restaurant in Monchique; the original building and entrance to the International School of the Algarve, which Swift was instrumental in founding; his house on the cliffs outside Carvoeiro; numerous buildings in Algarve display hand-crafted ornamental plasterwork by Swift, akin to pargeting  or relief in cement, generally depicting birds, animals and foliage.&lt;/ref&gt; He exhibited: drawings for ''Algarve: a portrait and a guide'' at the [[Diário de Notícias]] Gallery, Lisbon (1965); an exhibition of Porches Pottery at the Galeria Diário de Notícias, Lisbon (1970); an exhibition of his paintings at Galeria S Mamede, Lisbon (1974). He designed the sets for ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'' at the Portuguese National Theatre Company, Lisbon (1977). Swift lived and worked in the Algarve from 1962 until his premature death, from an inoperable brain tumour, in 1983. His work from this period includes portraits of his friend [[Francisco de Sá Carneiro]] (who commissioned Swift to paint his portrait when he was elected Prime Minister in 1980) and his partner, [[:pt:Snu Abecassis|Snu Abecassis]] (Danish-born journalist and editor who founded the Portuguese publishing house, Publicações Dom Quixote). Swift is buried in the [[Igreja Matriz (Porches)|Igreja Matriz]] church in Porches, for which he designed the stations of the cross.

==Criticism and ''X'' magazine==

In Dublin and London he partook of artistic and, always, literary life,&lt;ref&gt;"He moved to London, a melting pot of cultural and artistic ideas. At home in 'the Bohemian jungle of Soho', he partook of artistic and, always, literary life." — Aidan Dunne, "The lost hope of Irish art", ''The Sunday Tribune'', 28 November 1993&lt;/ref&gt; and from early on was involved with literary magazines.&lt;ref&gt;"From early on Swift was associated with literary magazines, wrote for them and even co-edited — with David Wright — the literary periodical ''X'', which was launched in London in 1959 and ran until 1961. Not much of a run, perhaps, but it had a remarkably distinguished list of contributors, including Beckett and Giacometti ..." — "The fall and rise of Patrick Swift", Brian Fallon, The Irish Times, 11 June 1992&lt;/ref&gt; In London he founded and co-edited, with the poet David Wright, '''''X'' magazine''', for which he contributed articles under the pseudonym "James Mahon" (Swift's mother was a Mahon from [[Co. Wicklow]]). Wright  declared Swift to be "the true begetter and leading light of ''X''",&lt;ref&gt;David Wright's Introduction to ''An Anthology from X'' (Oxford University Press, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; noting that he "was of course responsible for the art side of the magazine ... nor was he any less active on the literary side of the magazine. Here Swift and I worked in perfect harmony."&lt;ref name="ps"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ps…of Course, Patrick Swift 1927-83 |last=O’Mara |first=Veronica |year=1993|publisher=Gandon Books|location=Dublin }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from his involvement with ''X'' magazine, Swift was instrumental in several writers and poets having their work published, such as [[Patrick Kavanagh]],&lt;ref&gt;Swift believed in Kavanagh and promoted him. [[John Ryan (Dublin artist)|John Ryan]]:"Swift, in fact, made a decided impact on Kavanagh. It is hard to believe now that it was mainly a cultural impact and that he actually changed the older man's entire approach to poetry." (''Patrick Swift 1927-83'', Gandon Editions, 1993) Swift was responsible for Kavanagh having 19 poems published in the London-based literary magazine, ''[[Nimbus (literary magazine)|Nimbus]]'', in 1956, which proved to be the turning point in Kavanagh's career; his next volume of verse, ''Come Dance with Kitty Stobling'', was to be directly linked to the mini-collection in ''Nimbus''. Antoinette Quinn (''Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography'', Gill &amp; Macmillan, 2001): "Publication there [in ''Nimbus''] was to prove a turning point … The publication of his next volume of verse, ''Come Dance with Kitty Stobling'', was to be directly linked to the mini-collection in ''Nimbus'', and his Collected Poems (1964)". David Wright (then editor of ''Nimbus'') in his introduction to ''An Anthology from X'' (OUP, 1988): "These poems [19 of Kavanagh's poems were published] had been posted to me by Swift, whose brother James had invaded the poet's flat in Dublin, gathered up the trampled manuscripts scattered about the floor, and had them sorted, typed, and bound. One of the carbon copies was sent to me." Antoinette Quinn (''Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography''), however,  says that the idea of Jimmy Swift invading the poet's flat is a myth. Quinn states that Kavanagh had a typescript rejected by Macmillan's ("Macmillan's rejection had left him very downcast") and that subsequently Swift, on one of his trips to Dublin, "was invited to peruse the contents and decided that the poems should be published. He had to return to London… but persuaded Kavanagh to entrust the precious typescript to his brother, Jimmy, to have three copies professionally typed up...[Jimmy,] acting under his brothers instructions... sent one copy each to David Wright and [[Martin Green (author)|Martin Green]] in London" (''Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography'', Gill &amp; Macmillan Ltd, 2001, pp. 350-351). Wright's version of events is, no doubt, the story put out by Swift himself, and one which would not have displeased Kavanagh. Swift was also instrumental in the publication of Kavanagh's ''Collected Poems'' (1964). Martin Green (who put together the collection for MacGibbon and Kee in 1964): "It was following the suggestion of the painter Patrick Swift and the poet Anthony Cronin that the publication came about."([https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jan/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview8  Martin Green in a letter to ''The Guardian'', 2005]; see also ''Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography'', Antoinette Quinn, Gill &amp; Macmillan Ltd, 2001, p. 359.) Kavanagh would often stay with Swift and his family at 9 Westbourne Terrace. Regarding their friendship, Antoinette Quinn says, "Swift believed in his genius and indulged him and... the older man... came to lean on Swift as a beloved nephew."(''Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography'', p: 297) Kavanagh would often stay with Swift and his family at 9 Westbourne Terrace: "In London he generally stayed with the Swifts" (Antoinette Quinn, ''Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography'').&lt;/ref&gt; [[John McGahern]]&lt;ref&gt;For Swift’s involvement with McGahern in getting his first novel published see ''Young John McGahern: Becoming a Novelist'' by Denis Sampson (OUP, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; (first published in ''X'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;"The End or the Beginning of Love", ''X'', Vol. II, No. I ( March 1961). An extract from McGahern’s first novel, ''The End or the Beginning of Love''. The novel was never published. After his visit to London McGahern decided to re-worked it into two novels: ''The Barracks'' (1963) and  ''The Dark'' (1965). See Young John McGahern: Becoming a Novelist, Denis Sampson (OUP, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;), [[C. H. Sisson]], [[Brian Higgins (poet)|Brian Higgins]] and [[David Wright (poet)|David Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;For [[Martin Green (author)|Martin Green]] Swift was something of a catalyst: "It was he, together with Tony Cronin, who initially put up the idea of bringing together Kavanagh's poems for the Collected Poems… Paddy Swift had a catalytic enthusiasm that ignited a response elsewhere. I remember being introduced by him to [[John McGahern]] who was first published in ''X magazine'' … which I recommended for publication but was overruled ... It was he who brought to my attention the Charles Sisson version of ''Catullus'', which I subsequently published … It was he who helped to find a publisher for Brian Higgins ..." (''Patrick Swift 1927-83'', Gandon Editions, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; David Wright regarding Swift promoting his own work: "Swift and Cronin... brought me to the attention of the publisher Derek Verschoyle — and this was typical of Swift, who would take immense pains to push the product of anybody whose work he believed in, yet never bothered to promote his own."&lt;ref name="ps"/&gt;

===Brian Fallon===
"''X'', a remarkable publication which, in some respects, was light years ahead of its time ... Swift's criticism is that of the practicing artist not that of a practicing critic, and when speaking of his criticism I do not merely mean only his occasional critical essays, but his activity as co-editor of a magazine and as champion of Bacon, Freud, Auerbach, Craigie Aitchison, Nano Reid, Giacometti and David Bomberg (whose posthumous papers he edited).
This is criticism in the valid, active, propagandistic sense, not merely the daily or weekly grind of reviewing all sorts and conditions of artists, good and bad, but mostly mediocre. Once again much of Swift's activity in this field was semi-underground, almost subversive, often done in the teeth of the modernist establishment of his day. His record in this field speaks for itself... I cannot think of any other Irish painter who achieved anything like what he did as a critic and editor and discoverer of talent, and very few painters in any other country either. [[Wyndham Lewis]], it is true, was a verbose propagandist, but on the whole he was a bad critic, and somehow his propaganda almost always turns out to be some form of self-aggrandisement, whereas Swift almost always pushed the fortunes and reputations of his friends and almost never his own. Yet, you do not get, from his general stance, that his motives were simply friendship and good intentions. There is a tone of dedication throughout, as though he was serving art, and not merely artists... It is a peculiarity of his very individual [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and personality that Swift cannot be ‘placed’ purely as a painter. He was an artist in the broad sense before he was specifically a painter, and his context embraces literature and other disciplines besides painting or drawing (It is noticeable that he had more friends who were literary men than friends who were painters). Swift is not a painter’s painter, he is an artist’s artist, a man whose mentality overlapped into other fields besides his own chosen one."&lt;ref&gt;Brian Fallon, "Patrick Swift and Irish Art" (1993), ''Patrick Swift: an Irish Painter in Portugal'', Gandon Editions, 2001 (First published: Portfolio 2 - Modern Irish Arts Review, Gandon Editions, Cork, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumous==
[[File:Patrick.Swift.Plaque.Hatch.Street.Studio.JPG|140px|thumb|Hatch Street Studio]] In 1993 Gandon Editions published a biography&lt;ref&gt;''Patrick Swift 1927-83 - PS...of course'', Veronica O'Mara (ed.), Gandon Editions, Kinsale, 1993. In 1984 Swift's widow, Oonagh, organized a gathering of his friends in the Algarve where it was decided that [[John Ryan (Dublin artist)|John Ryan]] would put together a book to commemorate Swift's life. Ryan, however, had been suffering from ill health for many years and died in 1992 before completing his commemorative book.&lt;/ref&gt; of Swift to coincide with the IMMA Retrospective. The IMMA Retrospective was acclaimed by critics and artists alike.&lt;ref&gt;"The lost hope of Irish art ... belated recognition for Patrick Swift, a painter born out of his time." — [[Aidan Dunne]], "The lost hope of Irish art", ''[[Sunday Tribune]]'', 28 November 1993; "His exhibition at the Royal Hospital quite simply bowled me over, and I realised at once that I was looking at pictures by probably the most formidable Irish artist of this century — perhaps including [[Jack Butler Yeats|Jack Yeats]]... Some of the strongest contemporary portraits I have ever seen." — [[Derek Hill (painter)|Derek Hill]] in a letter to ''The Irish Times'', 24 Jan 1994; "A man who made his paintings talk... He may well be one of the greatest of Irish painters. When the dust has settled and the critics have had their say, the paintings will speak for themselves... His paintings hold you and address you in a language so intimate and disturbingly personal that even if you don't know much about art you are aware you have been moved at a visceral level." — ''[[The Sunday Business Post]]'', 20 Feb 1994; "Probably no painter here since the Literary Revival has had a more central role in cultural life in the broader sense. And not only in Ireland either; Swift was a seminal figure in London too, even if the general public knew very little of him... There can be few Irishmen of his epoch, whether poets or painters or novelists, who are of such biographical interest and who touched their age at so many key points." — [[Brian Fallon (critic)|Brian Fallon]], "The legacy of Patrick Swift", ''[[The Irish Times]]'', 2 Dec 1993; "The Irish public was astonished when a major Swift exhibition was mounted in the Irish Museum of Modern Art in 1994." — ''Modern Art in Ireland'', Dorothy Walker, The Lilliput Press, 1997, p. 43;  "Certainly, from now onwards, no one can write Patrick Swift out of Irish art history." — Brian Fallon,''The Irish Times'', 8 Dec 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 the Department of Foreign Affairs (who also awarded Swift the grant to study in Italy) sponsored the "Patrick Swift: An Irish Artist In Portugal" exhibitions that were held at the Crawford Municipal Gallery, Cork, and Palacio Foz in Lisbon. In 2004 Swift's work appeared on the BBC Antiques Roadshow.&lt;ref&gt;Rotherham Roadshow, Sunday 3 October 2004 ( [http://painterpatrickswift.blogspot.com/1983/05/antiques-roadshow-2004.html Image]) The BBC art expert, Stephen Somerville, was highly praising of his work, saying simply of a London tree painting: "I love it". The father of the lady who brought Swift's work to the ARS seems to have been a sort of patron of Swift’s.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the Office of Public Works, Dublin, held an exhibition of paintings, drawings and watercolours by Swift. His portrait of Patrick Kavanagh forms part of the [[CIÉ]] (Irish state transport authority) collection and recently toured as part of the "CIE: Art On The Move" exhibitions to much acclaim. Two pictures from IMMA's permanent collection, ''Forget-me-[K]nots on a Cane Table'' &amp; ''London Self-Portrait'', were exhibited in "The Moderns" exhibition (IMMA, October 2010-February 2011).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2053">A '''re-recording''' is a recording produced following a new performance of a work of music. This is most commonly, but not exclusively, by a popular artist or group. It differs from a [[reissue]], which involves a second or subsequent release of a previously-recorded piece of music.

Re-recordings are often produced decades after the original recordings were released, usually under contract terms more favorable to the artists. This is especially common among acts that originally agreed to [[Recording contract|contracts]] that would be considered unfair and exploitative today.&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2013/05/re_recordings_runaway_and_other_classic_songs_redone_in_the_studio_can_we.html| last=Mandl| first=Dave| title=Same old song? Not exactly| date=May 10, 2013|website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]| publisher=The Slate Group LLC| accessdate=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When re-recordings are issued under newer contracts, artists can collect far higher royalties for use in films, commercials, and movie trailers.&lt;ref name=Slate /&gt; Other acts re-record their work for artistic reasons. [[Jeff Lynne]] of the [[Electric Light Orchestra]] released [[Mr. Blue Sky: The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra|a solo best-of album]] with new versions of previous hits like "[[Mr. Blue Sky]]", the original of which Lynne described as "[not] quite how I meant it".&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/20/artists-rerecording-old-hits |date=October 19, 2012 |last=Pattison | first=Louis |title=From Patrick Wolf to Def Leppard, why do artists keep re-recording their old hits? |newspaper=The Guardian | accessdate=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-recordings commonly appear in [[online music store]]s and [[streaming media|streaming]] services, such as the [[iTunes Store]] and [[Spotify]];&lt;ref name=Slate /&gt; the original recording may or may not be available.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3735">A '''running gag''', or '''running joke''', is a [[literary device]] that takes the form of an amusing [[joke]] or a [[comedy|comical]] reference and appears repeatedly throughout a work of [[literature]] or other form of [[storytelling]]. Though they are similar, [[catchphrase]]s are not considered running gags.&lt;ref name="byron" /&gt;&lt;ref name="beaver" /&gt;

Running gags can begin with an instance of [[unintentional humor]] that is repeated in variations as the joke grows familiar and [[audience]]s anticipate reappearances of the gag. The humor in a running gag may derive entirely from how often it is repeated, however the underlying statement or situation will always require some form of [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jocularity jocularity]. Therefore, a statement which is merely trivial in nature will not turn into a running gag simply by being repeated over and over again. A running gag may also derive its humor from the (in)appropriateness of the situation in which the gag occurs, or setting up the audience to expect another occurrence of the joke and then substituting something else (''bait and switch''). Running gags are found mostly in [[Situation comedy|television shows]],&lt;ref name="morganrussell" /&gt; but also appear in other places, such as [[video game]]s, [[film]]s, [[book]]s, and [[comic strip]]s.

A running gag can be verbal or visual and may "convey social values by echoing belligerent speakers with a barrage of caricatured threats."&lt;ref name="Brunvand719"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brunvand|first=Jan Harold|authorlink=Jan Harold Brunvand|title=American Folklore : An Encyclopedia Garland Reference Library of the Humanities ; Vol. 1551|publisher=New York Garland, 1998 |isbn=978-0-8153-3350-0 |page= 719; 812}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a character may present others with a proposition that is so ridiculous or outrageous it is likely to be self-mocking to the point where the original request has little or no chance of actually being carried out and results in a humorous effect.&lt;ref name="Brunvand719"/&gt; Occasionally, the characters themselves may be aware of the running gag and make humorous mention of it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33847">'''Sailors' superstitions''' have been [[superstition]]s particular to [[sailor]]s or mariners, and which traditionally have been common around the world.  Some of these beliefs are popular superstitions, while others are actually better described as traditions, stories, folklore, tropes, myths, or legend.

The origins of many of these superstitions are based in the inherent risks of [[sailing]], and [[luck]], either good or bad, as well as [[portents]] and [[omens]] that would be given associative meaning in relation to the life of a mariner, sailor, fisherman or a crew in general. Even into the 21st century, "fishers and related fishing workers" still have amongst the most dangerous jobs, with the second highest rate of mortality only after [[lumberjack|loggers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/4326676/dangerous-jobs-america/|work=[[''Time'' (magazine)|''Time'']]|title=The Most Dangerous Jobs in America|first=David|last=Johnson|date=May 13, 2016|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bad luck==
{{see also|Evil eye}}
By far the best known sailors' superstitions involve bad luck.

===Red Sunrise===
Sailors are taught if the sunrise is red to take warning. The day ahead will be dangerous.

"Red Sky at night, Sailors delight; Red Sky in the morning, Sailors take warning."

===Jonah===
A "[[Jonah]]" is a long-established expression among sailors, meaning a person (either a sailor or a passenger) who is bad luck, which is based on the Biblical prophet Jonah.  The [[Jonah (comics)|comic character Jonah's]] name is a direct reference to the long established sailor's superstition.
This concept is prominent in the film ''[[Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World]]''.

===Unlucky days===
[[Friday]] is considered to be an unlucky day in some cultures, and perhaps the most enduring sailing superstition is that it is unlucky to begin a voyage or 'set sail' on a Friday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In 18th century New England, rolling clouds and roaring waves were thought as bad omens, so sailing on days under such conditions was considered inadvisable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=McCullough|page=178|title=[[John Adams (book)|John Adams]]|place=New York|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2001|isbn=0-684-81363-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sirens and Scylla===
[[File:Odysseus Sirens BM E440 n2.jpg|thumb|left|Odysseus and the Sirens, eponymous vase of the [[Siren Painter]], ca. 480-470 BC, ([[British Museum]])]]
[[File:The Siren.jpg|thumb|upright|right|''The Siren'', by [[John William Waterhouse]] (circa 1900), depicted as a fish-chimera.]]

[[Siren (mythology)|Sirens]] were mythological, often dangerous and beautiful, creatures, portrayed as [[femme fatale|femmes fatales]] who lured nearby sailors with their enchanting music and voices to shipwreck on the rocky coast of their island.&lt;ref name=Karoglou&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|issue=Winter 2018|year=2018|last=Karoglou|first=Kiki|title=Dangerous Beauty: Medusa in Classical Art|pages=36–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were portrayed in both Greek and Roman mythology as sea deities who lured mariners, and in Roman lore were daughters of [[Phorcys]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]]. V. 846; [[Ovid]] XIV, 88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[Argonautica]]'' (4.891–919); ''[[Odyssey]]'' XII, 39; [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 141; [[Lycophron]], ''Alexandra'' 712 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the ''[[Odyssey]]'', the hero [[Odysseus]], wishing to hear the sirens' seductive and destructive song, must protect himself and his crew by having his fellow sailors tie him to the [[mast (sailing)|mast]] and then stop their own ears with wax (''see image'').

In another myth, [[Hera]], queen of the gods, persuaded the Sirens to enter a singing contest with the [[Muse]]s, which the Sirens lost;&lt;ref name=Lempriere&gt;Lemprière 768.&lt;/ref&gt; out of their anguish, writes [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at [[Aptera, Greece|Aptera]] ("featherless"), where they formed the islands in the bay that were called [[Souda (island)|''Souda'']] (modern Lefkai).&lt;ref&gt;Caroline M. Galt, "A marble fragment at Mount Holyoke College from the Cretan city of Aptera", ''Art and Archaeology'' '''6''' (1920:150).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Denarius Sextus Pompeius-Scilla.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Scylla on the reverse of a first century B.C. [[denarius]] minted by [[Sextus Pompeius]]]]
Another mythological creature, the [[Scylla]], is a similar female sea demon that is both dangerous yet beautiful.&lt;ref name=Karoglou /&gt; Sirens supposedly "lured mariners to their deaths with their melodious, enchanting song", while "Scylla sent countless sailors to the depths of the sea."&lt;ref name=Karoglou /&gt;

===Albatross===
The [[albatross]] as a superstitious relic is referenced in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s well-known poem [[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]].  It is considered very unlucky to kill an albatross; in Coleridge's poem, the narrator killed the bird and his fellow sailors eventually force him to wear the dead bird around his neck.

===Banana===
Having [[banana]]s on a ship, especially on a private boat or fishing yacht, is considered bad luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/luck/superstition/bananas.asp|title=Banana Ban |work=Snopes.com|last=Mikkelson|first=Barbara|date=November 13, 2012|accessdate=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whistling===
Whistling is usually considered to be bad luck with the possible exception of the sources mentioned below. It is said that to whistle is to challenge the wind itself, and that to do so will bring about a storm. Another tale is that it has been considered bad luck ever since the mutiny aboard HMS ''Bounty''; [[Fletcher Christian]] is said to have used a whistle as the signal to begin the mutiny against Captain [[William Bligh]].

==Good luck==
Sailors also had a culture of items or practices that were believed to bring [[good luck]], or trinkets to ward off bad luck or the evil eye.

===Cats===
{{see also|Cat communication}}
[[File:Tiddles cat.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Tiddles'', a black cat who gained fame as a [[Royal Navy]] [[ship's cat]].]]
While [[Cultural depictions of cats|in many cultures]], a [[black cat]] is considered unlucky, British and Irish sailors considered adopting a black "[[ship's cat]]" because it would bring good luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions  |last=Eyers |first=Jonathan |year=2011 |publisher=[[A &amp; C Black]] |location=London|isbn=978-1-4081-3131-2 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Symbols and Imagery|last=de Vries|first=Ad|year=1976 |publisher=North-Holland Publishing Company|location=Amsterdam|isbn=0-7204-8021-3|pages=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some logic to this belief: cats eat (or at least kill) rodents, which can damage ropes and stores of grain on board, and they are intelligent animals, a high level of care was directed toward them to keep them happy, and research has backed up this superstition. Evidence published in 2017 by a [[genetics|geneticist]] the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|University of Leuven]] shows that Egyptian cats spread their [[mitochondrial DNA]] through shipping lanes to medieval northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/06/cats-are-an-extreme-outlier-among-domestic-animals/|work=[[ArsTechnica]]|date=19 June 2017|title=Cats are an extreme outlier among domestic animals|last=Newitz|first=Annalee|accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Briggs|first1=Helen|title=How cats conquered the ancient world|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-40306897|accessdate=19 June 2017|work=BBC News|date=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary results of that genetic study concluded that cats were also carried on trading ships to control rodents, and that practice was adopted by traders from other nations, including [[Vikings]] in northern Germany around the 8th to 11th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cats sailed with Vikings to conquer the world, genetic study reveals|url=http://www.sciencealert.com/cats-sailed-with-vikings-to-conquer-the-world-genetic-study-reveals|website=www.sciencealert.com|date=23 September 2016|publisher=Science Alert|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sailors believed that [[polydactyl cats]] were better at catching pests, possibly connected with the suggestion that extra digits give a polydactyl cat better balance, important when at sea. Cats were believed to have [[miracle|miraculous]] powers that could protect ships from dangerous [[weather]]. Another popular belief was that cats could start storms through magic stored in their tails. If a ship's cat fell or was thrown overboard, it was thought that it would summon a terrible storm to sink the ship and that if the ship was able to survive, it would be cursed with nine years of bad luck.  Other beliefs included: if a cat licked its fur against the grain, it meant a [[hail]]storm was coming; if it sneezed it meant rain; and if it was frisky it meant wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunwoody|first1=H.

===Cormorants===
{{see|Birds in culture}}

[[Cormorant]]s, in some Scandinavian areas, are considered a good omen; in particular, in Norwegian tradition spirits of those lost at sea come to visit their loved ones disguised as cormorants.&lt;ref name="Murphy-Hiscock2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arin Murphy-Hiscock|title=Birds - A Spiritual Field Guide: Explore the Symbology and Significance of These Divine Winged Messengers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYLYIJtWr-MC&amp;pg=PA48|date=18 January 2012|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=1-4405-2688-5|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whistling===
[[Whistling#Superstition|Whistling]] on board a sailing ship is thought to encourage the wind strength to increase.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This is regularly alluded to in the [[Aubrey-Maturin]] books by [[Patrick O'Brian]].
On boats and ships where whistling was taboo, the cook was usually excused, because as long as he was whistling, he was not stealing the food.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Klabautermann===
[[File:Klabautermann on ship.jpg|thumb|left|A Klabautermann on a ship, from ''Buch Zur See'', 1885.]]
Traditionally, a type of [[kobold]], called a [[Klabautermann]], lives aboard ships and helps sailors and [[fishermen]] on the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[North Sea]] in their duties. He is a merry and diligent creature, with an expert understanding of most watercraft, and an irrepressible musical talent. He also rescues sailors washed overboard. The name comes from the [[Low German]] verb ''klabastern'' meaning "rumble" or "make a noise". An [[etymology]] deriving the name from the verb ''kalfatern'' ("to caulk") has also been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Leander Petzoldt, ''Kleines Lexikon der Dämonen und Elementargeister'', Becksche Reihe, 1990, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;  A carved klabautermann image, of a small sailor dressed in [[yellow]] with a [[tobacco pipe]] and woollen sailor's cap, often carrying a caulking hammer, is attached to the mast as a symbol of good luck.  However, despite the positive attributes, there is one [[omen]] associated with his presence: no member of a ship blessed by his presence shall ever set eyes on him; he only ever becomes visible to the crew of a doomed ship.&lt;ref&gt;Melville, F., ''The Book of Faeries'' (2002 Quarto Publishing).&lt;/ref&gt;  The belief in Klabautermänner dates to at least the 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;Ellett, Mrs. (Jan. 1846). "Traditions and Superstitions", ''The American Whig Review: A Whig Journal'', Vol. III. New York: George H. Colton. pp. 107-108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Patron Saints===
Sailors have had several [[patron saint]]s.

[[Saint Nicholas]] is probably the most famous; according to his [[hagiography]], he calmed a storm by prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalrelief.org/church-in-action/75/75th-celebration-stories/the-story-of-st-nicholas|work=Episcopal Relief|title=The Story of St. Nicholas|author=|date=|accessdate=December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint [[Brendan the Navigator]] is also considered a patron saint of sailors and navigators, due to his mythical voyage to [[St. Brendan’s Island]].

Saint [[Erasmus of Formiae]], also known as Saint Elmo, may have become the patron of sailors because he is said to have continued preaching even after a thunderbolt struck the ground beside him. This prompted sailors, who were in danger from sudden storms and lightning, to claim his prayers. The electrical discharges at the mastheads of ships were read as a sign of his protection and came to be called "[[St. Elmo's Fire|Saint Elmo's Fire]]".&lt;ref name="Eyers, Jonathan 2011"&gt;Eyers, Jonathan (2011). ''Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions''. A&amp;C Black, London, UK. {{ISBN|978-1-4081-3131-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=182 St. Erasmus (St. Elmo)]  ''Catholic Online''. Retrieved 2012-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, Saint Elmo's Fire was usually good luck in traditional sailor's lore, but because it is a sign of electricity in the air and interferes with [[compass]] readings, sailors sometimes regarded it as an omen of bad luck and stormy weather.&lt;ref&gt;Beliefs often can be contradictory.  For example, [[St. Elmo's fire]] is reported to have been seen during the [[Siege of Constantinople]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453. It reportedly was seen emitting from the top of the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]]. The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] attributed it to a sign that the Christian God would soon come and destroy the conquering [[Muslim]] army. According to [[George Sphrantzes]], it disappeared just days before Constantinople fell, ending the Byzantine Empire.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collar-touching===
It is often considered lucky to touch the collar of a [[Sailor suit|sailor's suit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ht_02x-2JksC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;lpg=PA208&amp;dq=sailors+collar+lucky&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gAD6gjTFdC&amp;sig=VR6IYRmnQ9x7H28VjhIfkW2GY2Q&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r89eTsOVF4SzhAf1vbz7Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=sailors%20collar%20lucky&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of Superstitions 1949, Edwin Radford, Mona A. Radford, Kessinger Publishing] (p. 208)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mermaids and mermen===
[[Mermaid]]s usually are considered lucky, but not universally.  In [[Trinidad and Tobago]], sea-dwelling mer-men "were known to grant a wish, transform mediocrity into genius and confer wealth and power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://visittobago.gov.tt/our-culture/folktales|work=Visit Trinidad and Tobago|title=Folktales &amp; Superstitions|author=n.a.|date=n.d.|accessdate=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mermaids appear in [[Cornish folklore|British folklore]] as unlucky omens, both foretelling disaster and provoking it.&lt;ref name="briggs"&gt;Katharine Briggs, ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures'', "Mermaids", p 287. {{ISBN|0-394-73467-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several variants of the [[ballad]] ''[[Sir Patrick Spens]]'' depict a mermaid speaking to the doomed ships. In some versions, she tells them they will never see land again; in others, she claims they are near shore, which they are wise enough to know means the same thing. Mermaids can also be a sign of approaching rough weather,&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 2, p 19, New York: Dover, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; and some have been described as monstrous in size, up to {{convert|2000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="briggs"/&gt;

Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale "[[The Little Mermaid]]" was published in 1837. The story was adapted into a Disney film with a [[bowdlerize]]d plot. In the original version, The Little Mermaid is the youngest daughter of a sea king who lives at the bottom of the sea. To pursue a prince with whom she has fallen in love, the mermaid gets a sea witch to give her legs and agrees to give up her tongue in return. Though she is found on the beach by the prince, he marries another. Told she must stab the prince in the heart to return to her sisters, she can't do it out of love for him. She then rises from the ocean and sees ethereal beings around her who explain that mermaids who do good deeds become daughters of the air, and after 300 years of good service they can earn a human soul.&lt;ref name="gilead2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hca.gilead.org.il/li_merma.html |author=Hans Christian Andersen | title=The Little Mermaid |publisher=Hca.gilead.org.il |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[The Little Mermaid (statue)|world-famous statue]] of the Little Mermaid, based on Andersen's fairy tale, has been in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] since August 1913, with copies in 13 other locations around the world.&lt;ref name="WSJ Mich"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124865622123982685#mod=rss_whats_news_us |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iZbZU3o9?url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124865622123982685.html |archivedate=July 27, 2009 |title=In a Mermaid Statue, Danes Find Something Rotten in State of Michigan |first=Timothy |last=Aeppel |date=July 27, 2009 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] |accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calgary.ca/CSPS/Recreation/Pages/Public-Art/Downtown-Public-Art-Circuit-tour.aspx#mermaid |title=The Little Mermaid&amp;nbsp;– Downtown Public Art Circuit tour |publisher=The City of Calgary |accessdate=2012-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410074105/http://www.calgary.ca/CSPS/Recreation/Pages/Public-Art/Downtown-Public-Art-Circuit-tour.aspx#mermaid |archivedate=2012-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mermaidsofearth.com/mermaid-statues-mermaid-sculptures/public/the-little-mermaid-statue-copenhagen/ |title=Mermaids of Earth |publisher=Philip Jepsen |accessdate=May 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sailor tattoos===

[[File:Tattooed sailor aboard the USS New Jersey.jpg|thumb|Tattooed sailor aboard the USS ''New Jersey'', 1944]]
[[Sailor tattoos]] are a visual way to preserve the culture of the maritime superstitions.  Sailors believed that certain symbols and [[talisman]]s would help them in when facing certain events in life; they thought that those symbols would attract good luck or bad luck in the worst of the cases:
{{quote|Sailors, at the constant mercy of the elements, often feel the need for religious images on their bodies to appease the angry powers that caused storms and drowning far from home.|Tattoo Archives &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tattooarchive.com/tattoo_history/religious_designs.html|title=Religious Designs|publisher=Tattoo Archives|year=2000|accessdate=July 24, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813194053/http://www.tattooarchive.com/tattoo_history/religious_designs.html|archivedate=August 13, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For example, the images of a pig and a hen were good luck; both animals are not capable of swimming, but they believed that God would look down upon a shipwreck and see an animal not capable of swimming and would take them into his hand and place them on land.  Another example of superstitions is the North Star (Nautical Star or [[compass rose]]); sailors had the belief that by wearing this symbol it would help them to find his or her way home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sailor Tattoos, Become a Cool Mariner|url=http://www.marineinsight.com/marine/life-at-sea/maritime-history/sailor-tattoos-become-a-cool-mariner/#ixzz1rWmmKP1R|publisher=Marine in Sight|accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sailors designed mariner motifs of their own, according to their travel experiences in the ocean.

The [[Line-crossing ceremony]] commemorates a sailor's first crossing of the [[Equator]].  Its practices invoke good luck on the new sailor.  The ceremony of Crossing the Line is an initiation [[rite]] in the [[Royal Navy]], [[Royal Canadian Navy]], [[U.S. Navy]], [[U.S. Coast Guard]], [[U.S. Marine Corps]], and other navies that commemorates a sailor's first crossing of the Equator.&lt;ref name="Eyers, Jonathan 2011"/&gt; The tradition may have originated with ceremonies when passing [[headland]]s, and become a "folly" sanctioned as a boost to [[morale]],&lt;ref name="FitzRoy"&gt;[[Robert FitzRoy]] (1839) ''Narrative of the surveying voyages of His Majesty's Ships Adventure and Beagle between the years 1826 and 1836'', London: Henry Colburn. pp. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F10.2&amp;pageseq=84 57–58].&lt;/ref&gt; or have been created as a test for seasoned sailors to ensure their new shipmates were capable of handling long rough times at sea. Sailors who have already crossed the Equator are nicknamed (Trusty) ''Shellbacks'', often referred to as ''Sons of [[Poseidon|Neptune]]''; those who have not are nicknamed (Slimy) ''Pollywogs'' (in 1832 the nickname ''griffins'' was noted &lt;ref name="Darwin"&gt;Keynes, R. D. ed. (2001) ''Charles Darwin's Beagle diary'', Cambridge University Press, pp. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=68 36–38].&lt;/ref&gt;).

[[File:Chrzest równikowy 4.JPG|thumb|right|Neptune and his entourage during a Polish line-crossing ceremony (''Chrzest równikowy'')]]

After crossing the line, Pollywogs receive [[subpoena]]s &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usni.org/store/item.asp?ITEM_ID=1239 Ceremonial Certificates - Neptune Subpoena]&lt;/ref&gt; to appear before ''King Neptune and his court'' (usually including his first assistant [[Davy Jones' Locker|Davy Jones]] and her Highness [[Amphitrite]] and often various dignitaries, who are all represented by the highest ranking seamen), who officiate at the ceremony, which is often preceded by a beauty contest of [[cross-dressing|men dressing up as women]]. Afterwards, some ''wogs'' may be "interrogated" by King Neptune and his entourage. During the ceremony, the Pollywogs undergo a number of increasingly embarrassing ordeals (such as wearing clothing inside out and backwards; crawling on hands and knees; being swatted with short lengths of firehose; kissing the Royal Baby's belly coated with axle grease, etc.), largely for the entertainment of the Shellbacks.  Once the ceremony is complete, a Pollywog receives a certificate &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usni.org/store/item.asp?ITEM_ID=1449 Ceremonial Certificates - Golden Shellback Certificate - Personalized]&lt;/ref&gt; declaring his new status.

U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] described his Crossing the Line ceremony aboard the "Happy Ship" ''[[USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|USS Indianapolis]]'' with his "Jolly Companions" in a letter to his wife [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] on 26 November 1936:
{{quote| Marvelous costumes in which King Neptune and Queen Aphrodite [sic.] and their court appeared. The Pollywogs were given an intensive initiation lasting two days, but we have all survived and are now full-fledged Shellbacks"|FDR &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Blanche Weisen Cook|Cook]]|first=Blanche| title=Eleanor Roosevelt, vol. 2 (1933-1938)|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|year=1999|ISBN=978-0140178944|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{as of|1/1/16}} some cruise ships also have a line-crossing ceremony for their passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boards.cruisecritic.com/showthread.php?t=650991|title=Cruise Critic|date=October 26, 2006|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Over a barrel===
[[File:Punishment of the Paddle, 1912.jpg|thumb|Punishment of the Paddle, 1912]]
The phrase ''[[wikt:over a barrel|over a barrel]]'', meaning to be in a [[dilemma]] or "a weak or difficult position", may refer to the [[first aid]] practice amongst sailors of placing a [[drowning]] victim's head over a barrel, and rolling his body over it, in an attempt to remove aspirated water from the person's lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/over+a+barrel|title=Over a barrel|accessdate=April 13, 2017|work=The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=2003|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this etymology is challenged, and may come instead from the custom of punishing a prisoner by [[flogging]] or [[paddling]] him while he is strapped to a barrel; there is no documentary evidence it was actually used specifically as a nautical phrase.&lt;ref name=Wilton&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordorigins.org/index.php/site/comments/over_a_barrel/|title=Over a barrel|accessdate=April 13, 2017|work=Wordorigins.org|first=David|last=Wilton|date=December 26, 2006|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Either way, the image created in the mind is that of total helplessness and loss of control,&lt;ref name=Wilton /&gt; which is a common anxiety of sailors in fear of corporal punishment.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/over-a-barrel.html|title=Over a barrel|accessdate=April 13, 2017|work=The Phrases Finder (UK)|first=Gary|last=Martin|date=December 26, 2006|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scottish photography''' is the creation of durable images by recording light, or other electromagnetic radiation, in Scotland, or by Scottish people.

Scotland played a major role in the technical development of photography in the nineteenth century through the efforts of figures including [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[David Brewster]]. Its artistic development was pioneered by [[Robert Adamson (photographer)|Robert Adamson]] and artist [[David Octavius Hill]], whose work is considered to be some of the first and finest artistic uses of photography. Thomas Roger was one of the first commercial photographers. [[Thomas Keith (doctor)|Thomas Keith]] was one of the first architectural photographers. [[George Washington Wilson]] pioneered [[instant photography]] and [[landscape photography]]. [[Clementina Hawarden]] and Mary Jane Matherson were amongst the first female photographers. [[War photography]] was pioneered by [[John McCosh]], [[James Robertson (photographer)|James Robertson]], Alexander Graham and [[Mairi Chisholm]].

In the early twentieth century notable photographic work in Scotland included that of visiting artists, such as [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]] and [[Paul Strand]]. There was also the record of the [[Gorbals]] in Glasgow made by [[Bert Hardy]], Joseph MacKenzie and [[Oscar Marzaroli]]. Having pioneered photography in the late nineteenth century, the artistic attainment of native photographers was not high in the early twentieth century. In the late twentieth century, photography in Scotland enjoyed a renaissance, encouraged by figures including Richard Hough and Murray Johnston. More recent exponents who have received acclaim include Pradip Malde, [[Maud Sulter]] and Owen Logan.

Scotland lacks a national gallery of photography, but there are the dedicated Stills and Portfolio galleries in Edinburgh and space dedicated to photography at the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]] and the Street Level Gallery in Glasgow. Photography is taught at degree and further education level in Scotland and the history of photography is usually taught within the context of art history.

==History==
===Technical origins===
[[File:Tartan Ribbon.jpg|thumb|right|The world's first [[colour photography|colour photograph]], made by the Scottish scientist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1861, was of a tartan ribbon.]]
In the early nineteenth century Scottish scientists [[David Brewster]] (1781–1868) and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] (1831–79) played a major part in the development of the techniques of photography.&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt; Brewster was an expert on optics and had refined the microscope and invented the [[kaleidoscope]]. He collaborated with a number of figures, including [[Henry Fox Talbot]] (1800–77), who had developed the [[calotype]] photographic process.&lt;ref&gt;S. Stevenson, A. Morrison-Low, A. Simpson, J. Lawson, R. Mackenzie, R. Gillanders and J. Lawson, ''Light from the Dark Room: A Celebration of Scottish Photography'' (Edinburgh: National Galleries of Scotland, 1995), {{ISBN|0903598582}}, pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell was among the first scientists to investigate colour and produced the first colour photograph in 1861, displayed by using three [[magic lantern]] projectors with different colour filters.&lt;ref&gt;S. Stevenson, A. Morrison-Low, A. Simpson, J. Lawson, R. Mackenzie, R. Gillanders and J. Lawson, ''Light from the Dark Room: A Celebration of Scottish Photography'' (Edinburgh: National Galleries of Scotland, 1995), {{ISBN|0903598582}}, pp. 20–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artistic development===
According to photo historian David Burn "there is a good case to be made for the proposition that the greatest contribution that Scotland has made to the visual arts, possibly to the arts as a whole, is in the art of photography".&lt;ref name=Burn2011&gt;D. Burn, "Photography", in M. Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0199693056}}, pp. 476–7.&lt;/ref&gt; A circle of scientists and artists gathered around Brewster in Edinburgh with the objective of refining the science and art of photography. In 1839 of the five examples of the [[daguerrotype]] and twenty "Photogenic Drawings" by Talbot were shown at the Exhibition of Arts, Manufacturers and Practical Sciences at the Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh. In 1841 four more daguerreotypes were displayed at the annual exhibition of the [[Royal Scottish Academy]]. By 1843 the Edinburgh Calotype Club had been formed, probably the world's first photographic club. The club dissolved in the mid-1850s as new processes appeared, such as the [[albumen print]] and wet [[collodion process]]. The Glasgow Photographic Society was founded in 1855, The Photographic Society of Scotland formed in 1856 and the Edinburgh Photographic Society in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;T.

Members of the Edinburgh Calotype Club included chemist [[Robert Adamson (photographer)|Robert Adamson]] (1821–48) and artist [[David Octavius Hill]] (1821–70), who as [[Hill &amp; Adamson]] formed the first photographic studio in Scotland at Rock House in Edinburgh in 1843. They originally worked together with the aim of recording the members of the [[Great Disruption|Disruption Assembly]], which saw the division of the [[Church of Scotland]] in 1843, for a large composite painting, but soon the photographs themselves became a major medium. Their output of around 3,000 [[calotype]] images in four years are considered some of the first and finest artistic uses of photography.&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt; They produced images influenced by [[genre art]] included their ''Edinburgh Ale'' (1843–46), where the poses of three drinking companions are based on scenes from Dutch art.&lt;ref name=Hannavy2013p575&gt;J. Hannavy, ed., ''Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography'' (London: Routledge, 2013), {{ISBN|1135873275}}, p. 575.&lt;/ref&gt; Hill and Adamson also pioneered the recording of rural life as a suitable subject for photography, recording the fisher folk of [[Newhaven, Edinburgh|Newhaven]], near Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;T. Normand, ''Scottish Photography: a History'' (Edinburgh: Luath Press, 2007), {{ISBN|1906307075}}, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Adamson trained Thomas Roger (1833–88) of St. Andrews, who was one of the first commercial photographers and beside commercial portraits, produced many genre style compositions.&lt;ref&gt;R.

Other pioneers included [[Thomas Annan]] (1829–87), who took portraits and landscapes, and whose photographs of the Glasgow slums were among the first to use the medium as a social record.&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt; Annan also pioneered the recording of industrial change, photographing the pumping stations and canals of the new waterways to Glasgow in the 1850s.&lt;ref name=Normand2007p107&gt;T. Normand, ''Scottish Photography: a History'' (Edinburgh: Luath Press, 2007), {{ISBN|1906307075}}, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of industrial development was taken up by Evelyn Carey (1858–1932), who recorded step-by-step the building of the [[Forth Railway Bridge]].&lt;ref name=Normand2007p107/&gt; Also interested in urban landscapes was Archibald Burns, who occupied part of the Rock House studio and whose ''The Horse Wynd'' and ''The Cowgate'' (both 1871) emphasised the picturesque aspects of Edinburgh's urban landscape.&lt;ref&gt;T. Normand, ''Scottish Photography: a History'' (Edinburgh: Luath Press, 2007), {{ISBN|1906307075}}, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; John Thomson (1852–90) undertook a similar documentary study of London street life between 1876 and 1877.&lt;ref&gt;T.

[[File:James Craig Annan (Scottish - The Dark Mountains - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[James Craig Annan]]'s ''The Dark Mountains'' (1904), uses the [[photogravure]] process to create a simple contrasting image.]]
Documentary [[war photography]] was pioneered by Scottish surgeon [[John McCosh]] (1805–85), who produced photographs of the [[Second Sikh War]] (1848–49) and the [[Second Burmese War]] (1852–53). Scottish photographer [[James Robertson (photographer)|James Robertson]] (1813–88) worked in the [[Crimean War]] (1853–56), producing a record of the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–55)|Siege of Sevastopol]] in 1853 and then being employed by the British army in India.&lt;ref&gt;T. Normand, ''Scottish Photography: a History'' (Edinburgh: Luath Press, 2007), {{ISBN|1906307075}}, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The émigré Scot Alexander Graham played a major role in photographing the [[American Civil War]], taking iconic images of ''President Lincoln on the Battlefield of Antietam'' (1862) and ''Home of a Rebel Sharpshooter'' (1863).&lt;ref&gt;T. Normand, ''Scottish Photography: a History'' (Edinburgh: Luath Press, 2007), {{ISBN|1906307075}}, pp. 93–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Scots that made there reputation as photographers abroad, often being the  first to exploit the medium there include [[William Carrick]] (1827–78) in Russia, [[William Notman]] (1826–91) and Alexander Henderson (1831–1913) in Canada, James MacDonald In Israel, John Thompson in Asia, [[Robert Turnbull Macpherson (photographer)|Robert MacPherson]] (1811–72) in Italy and [[George Valentine]] (1852–90) in New Zealand.&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt;

Annan's son [[James Craig Annan]] (1864–1946) popularised the work of Hill &amp; Adamson in the US and worked with American photographic advocate [[Alfred Stieglitz]] (1864–1946). Annan and Stieglitz pioneered the more stable [[photogravure]] process.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, pp. 146–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The younger Annan also joined the [[Linked Ring]], which broke away from the [[Royal Photographic Society]] in 1892 with a manifesto that saw photography as much as an art as a science and that it should be treated as the equal of conventional visual art. He championed the "artistic" framing and hanging of photographic exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;T. Normand, ''Scottish Photography: a History'' (Edinburgh: Luath Press, 2007), {{ISBN|1906307075}}, pp. 27–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth century to the Present===
A number of Scots acted as photographers in the First World War (1914–18), including dispatch rider and ambulance driver [[Mairi Chisholm]] (1896–1981) who used a lightweight Vest Pocket Kodak camera, that allowed her to capture an image during a bombardment, in her ''Chishom and Knocker Under Fire at Pervyse'' (1917), which can be seen as the first "action shots" of war.&lt;ref&gt;T. Normand, ''Scottish Photography: a History'' (Edinburgh: Luath Press, 2007), {{ISBN|1906307075}}, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having pioneered photography in the late nineteenth century, the artistic attainment of native photographers was not high in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name=Burn2011&gt;D. Burn, "Photography", in M. Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0199693056}}, pp. 476–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable photographic work in Scotland included that of visiting artists, such as [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]] (1882–1966), who produced illustrations for the work of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and [[Paul Strand]] (1890–1976), who produced atmospheric depictions of Hebridean landscapes. There was also the record of the [[Gorbals]] in Glasgow made by figures such as [[Bert Hardy]] (1913–95), [[Joseph MacKenzie]] (1929-2015) and [[Oscar Marzaroli]] (1933–88),&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt; and by [[Wolfgang Suschitzky]] (b. 1912) in Glasgow and Dundee.&lt;ref&gt;T.

In the late twentieth century, photography in Scotland enjoyed a renaissance, encouraged by figures including Richard Hough (1945–85), who founded the Stills Gallery for photography in Edinburgh in 1977, and Murray Johnston (1949–90), who was its director (1982–86).&lt;ref&gt;C. Henry, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19900106&amp;id=ez1AAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aFkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1767,1402979 "Scots photography loses a champion"], ''Glasgow Herald'', 6 January 1990, retrieved 9 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1986 ''Constructed Narratives'' exhibition at the Stills Gallery signalled the renaissance, showcasing the work of [[Calum Colvin]] (b. 1961) and Ron O'Donnell (b. 1952), both of whom produced intensely coloured and constructed photographic works.&lt;ref&gt;T. Normand, ''Scottish Photography: a History'' (Edinburgh: Luath Press, 2007), {{ISBN|1906307075}}, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Important practitioners in Scotland included the American [[Thomas Joshua Cooper]] (b. 1946).&lt;ref name=Burn2011&gt;D.

Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0199693056}}, pp. 476–7.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent exponents who have received acclaim include Pradip Malde (b. 1957), [[Maud Sulter]] (1960–2008) and Owen Logan (b. 1963). The range of contemporary talent was showcased by the 1995 ''Light in the Dark Room'' exhibition.&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt;

==Galleries==
Scotland lacks a national gallery of photography, but there are the dedicated Stills and Portfolio galleries in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt; There is also space dedicated to photography at the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]] and the Street Level Gallery in Glasgow. Traditional art galleries also increasingly accept exhibitions of photographic art.&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt;

==Education==
Photography is taught at degree level in Scotland at [[Edinburgh College of Art]], [[Napier University]], [[Glasgow School of Art]] and [[Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design]] within the [[University of Dundee]], where there is a particular emphasis on cutting edge technology. The history of photography is usually taught within the context of art history at institutions including [[St Andrews University]]. It is also taught at further education colleges throughout the country.&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt;{{clear}}

[[File:Screenplay example.svg|right|thumb|250px|A page of a screenplay]]

A '''screenplay writer''' (also called '''screenwriter''' for short), '''scriptwriter''' or '''scenarist''', is a writer who practices the craft of [[screenwriting]], writing [[screenplay]]s on which [[mass media]], such as [[film]]s, [[television program]]s and [[video games]], are based.

==Profession==
Screenwriting is a [[freelance]] profession. No education is required to become a professional screenwriter, just good [[storytelling]] abilities and [[imagination]]. Screenwriters are not hired employees but contracted freelancers. Most, if not all, screenwriters start their careers writing on speculation (spec) and so write without being hired or paid for it. If such a script is sold, it is called a [[spec script]]. What separates a [[professional]] screenwriter from an [[amateur]] screenwriter is that professional screenwriters are usually represented by a [[talent agent|talent agency]]. Also, professional screenwriters do not often work for free, but amateur screenwriters will often work for free and are considered "writers in training." Spec scripts are usually penned by unknown professional screenwriters and amateur screenwriters.

There are a legion of would-be screenwriters who attempt to enter the [[film industry]], but it often takes years of trial-and-error, failure, and gritty persistence to achieve success. In ''Writing Screenplays that Sell'', Michael Hague writes, "Screenplays have become, for the last half of [the twentieth] century, what the [[Great American Novel]] was for the first half. Closet writers who used to dream of the glory of getting into print now dream of seeing their story on the big or small screen."&lt;ref name=Hauge&gt;{{cite book|last=Hauge|first=Michael|title=Writing Screenplays That Sell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film industry==
Every screenplay and teleplay begins with a thought or idea, and screenwriters use their ideas to write scripts, with the intention of selling them and having them produced.&lt;ref name="Ferguson 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Brooks|title=Creativity and integrity: Marketing the "in development" screenplay|journal=Psychology and Marketing|date=17 April 2009|volume=26|issue=5|pages=421–444|doi=10.1002/mar.20281}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the script is based on an existing property, such as a book or person's life story, which is adapted by the screenwriter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenwriterdude.com/biopic---book-adaptation.html Biopic &amp; Book Adaptation - http://www.screenwriterdude.com/biopic---book-adaptation.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the time, a film project gets initiated by a screenwriter. The initiator of the project gets the exclusive writing assignment.&lt;ref name="Ferguson 2009"/&gt; They are referred to as "exclusive" assignments or "pitched" assignments. Screenwriters who often pitch new projects, whether original or an adaptation, often do not have to worry about competing for assignments and are often more successful. When word is put out about a project a [[film studio]], [[production company]], or producer wants done, they are referred to as "open" assignments. Open assignments are more competitive. If screenwriters are competing for an open assignment, more-established writers usually win the assignments. A screenwriter can also be approached and personally offered a writing assignment.

==Script doctoring==
Many screenwriters also work as full or part-time [[script doctor]]s, attempting to better a script to suit the desires of a [[film director|director]] or [[movie studio|studio]]. For instance, studio management may have a complaint that the motivations of the characters are unclear or that the dialogue is weak.

Script-doctoring can be quite lucrative, especially for the better-known writers. [[David Mamet]] and [[John Sayles]], for instance, fund the movies that they direct themselves, usually from their own screenplays, by writing and doctoring scripts for others. In fact, some writers make very profitable careers out of being the ninth or tenth writer to work on a piece, and they often work on projects that never see exposure to an audience of any size. Many up-and-coming screenwriters also [[ghostwrite]] projects and allow more-established screenwriters to take public credit for the project to increase the chances of it getting picked up.

==Development process==
After a screenwriter finishes a project, he or she pairs with an industry-based representative, such as a [[film producer|producer]], director, [[literary agent]], entertainment lawyer, or entertainment executive. The partnerships often pitch their project to investors or others in a position to further a project. Once the script is sold, the writer has only the rights that were agreed with the purchaser.&lt;ref name="Ferguson 2009"/&gt;

A screenwriter becomes credible by having work that is recognized, which gives the writer the opportunity to earn a higher income.&lt;ref name="Ferguson 2009"/&gt; As more films are produced independently (outside the studio system), many up-and-coming screenwriters are turning to pitch fests, screenplay contests, and independent development services to gain access to established and credible independent producers. Many development executives are now working independently to incubate their own pet projects.

==Production involvement==
Screenwriters are rarely involved in the development of a film. Sometimes they come on as advisors, or if they are established,  as a producer. Some screenwriters also direct. Although many scripts are sold each year, many do not make it into production because the number of scripts that are purchased every year exceeds the number of professional directors that are working in the film and [[TV industry]]. When a screenwriter finishes a project and sells it to a [[film studio]], [[production company]], TV network, or producer, he or she often has to continue networking, mainly with directors or executives, and push to have their projects "chosen" and turned into films or TV shows. If interest in a script begins to fade, a project can go dead.

==Union==
Most professional screenwriters in the U.S. are [[unionized]] and are represented by the [[Writers Guild of America]]. Although membership in the WGA is recommended, it is not required of a screenwriter to join. The WGA is the final arbiter on awarding [[WGA screenwriting credit system|writing credit]] for projects under its jurisdiction.  The WGA also looks upon and verifies film copyright materials.

'''''Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird''''' (''Autorretrato con Collar de Espinas'') is a 1940 painting by Mexican painter [[Frida Kahlo]].

Kahlo painted the self-portrait after her divorce from [[Diego Rivera]] and the end of her affair with photographer [[Nickolas Muray]]. Muray bought the portrait shortly after it was painted, and it is currently part of the Nickolas Muray collection at the Harry Ransom Center at the [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;Ditrich, "Self-portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Frida Kahlo]] was a Mexican painter active between 1925 and 1954. She began painting while bedridden due to a bus accident that left her seriously disabled. Most of her work consists of self-portraits, which deal directly with her struggle with medical issues, infertility, and her troubled marriage to Rivera. Painting self-portraits was therapeutic, allowing Kahlo to create a separate Frida on which to project her anguish and pain.&lt;ref name="Herrera"&gt;Herrera, “Kahlo, Frida".&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have interpreted her self portraits as a way for Kahlo to reclaim her body from medical issues and gender conformity. In particular, scholars have interpreted her self-portraits in the context of the tradition of male European artists using the female body as the subject of their paintings and an object of desire.&lt;ref&gt;Udall, “Frida Kahlo’s Mexican Body,” 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Kahlo, using her own image, reclaims this use from the patriarchal tradition. The autobiographical details of her life found in these works as well as her characteristic brows, elaborate hair, and vibrant Mexican clothing has made her a popular figure in Mexico and the United States.

Kahlo was a big supporter of the [[Mexican Revolution]], so much so that she attempted to change her birth date to correspond with the beginning of the Revolution in 1910.&lt;ref name="Herrera"/&gt; At the onset of this movement, a so-called “cult of Mexican femininity” gained popularity, which Jolie Olcott describes as “selflessness, martyrdom, self-sacrifice, an erasure of self and the negation of one’s outward existence.”&lt;ref&gt;Pankl and Blake, “Made in Her Image,” 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In rejection of this limited conception of femininity, Kahlo fashioned herself as a Mexican counterpart to the [[flapper]]s of the United States and Europe in the 1920s. Later, inspired by Rivera’s concept of [[Mexicanidad]], a passionate identification with Mexican pre-Hispanic indigenous roots, she donned the identity of the [[Tehuana]] woman.&lt;ref name="Herrera"/&gt; The Tehuana had a great deal of equality with their male [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] counterparts and represented strength, sensuality, and exoticism.&lt;ref name="PanklBlake8"&gt;Pankl and Blake, “Made in Her Image,” 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual analysis==
This rather small painting (approximately 24” x 18”), shows Kahlo in a frontal position and directly confronting the viewer’s gaze from the canvas. Her bold eyebrows hold the emphasis on her face, as a thorn necklace strangles her throat, trailing down her chest like the roots of a tree. A small black hummingbird with its wings outstretched hangs like a pendant from her throat. She is surrounded by insects and animals, setting the scene of a lush, but suffocatingly dense jungle. A monkey sits behind her right shoulder, its eyes focused on its hands, tugging at the thorn necklace, causing Kahlo to bleed. Above her head, two dragonflies float in mid-air, above two butterfly clips nesting in the elaborate hairstyle that crowns her head. A black panther with striking ice blue eyes peers over her left shoulder watching.

==Symbolism==
Kahlo’s identification with indigenous Mexican culture greatly affected her painting aesthetic. By using powerful iconography from indigenous Mexican culture, Kahlo situates herself in a tradition of rebellion against colonial forces and male rule.&lt;ref name="PanklBlake8"/&gt; The dead hummingbird which hangs around her neck is considered a good luck charm for falling in love in Mexican folklore.&lt;ref name="FuentesKahlo78"/&gt; An alternate interpretation is that the hummingbird pendant is a symbol of [[Huitzilopochtli]], the [[Aztec]] god of war.&lt;ref&gt;Baddeley, “Her Dress Hangs Here,” 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the black panther is symbolic of bad luck and death and the monkey is a symbol of evil.&lt;ref name="FuentesKahlo78"&gt;Fuentes and Kahlo, The Diary of Frida Kahlo,” 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The natural landscape, which normally symbolizes fertility, contrasts with the deathly imagery in the foreground. Rivera gave Kahlo a [[spider monkey]] as a gift, thus suggesting that it could be a symbol of Rivera, especially since he inflicts pain upon Kahlo by tugging the thorn necklace hard enough to make her bleed.&lt;ref name="FuentesKahlo78"/&gt; Alternately, the thorn necklace could allude to Christ’s crown of thorns, thus likening herself to a Christian martyr, and representing the pain and anguish she felt after her failed romantic relationships. In line with this interpretation, the butterflies and dragonflies could symbolize her resurrection.&lt;ref name="PanklBlake8"/&gt;

== Exhibition history ==

The University of Texas at Austin acquired the painting in 1966. Since 1990, it has appeared in several exhibitions internationally:

'''Shinto music''' is the ceremonial and festive music of {{nihongo|[[Shinto]]|神道}}, the native religion of [[Japan]]. Its [[origin myth]] is the erotic dance of [[Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto]] which lured [[Amaterasu]] from her cave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians XII.850f |author=Sadie, Stanley (ed.) |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2001 |ISBN=978-0-19-517067-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9323">Indigenous Mexican art celebrates the skeleton and uses it as a regular motif.  The use of skulls and skeletons in art originated before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Conquest]]: The [[Aztecs]] excelled in stone sculptures and created striking carvings of their Gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2008/may/02/skullartisnotanewidea|title=Skull art is not a new idea|first=Jonathan|last=Jones|date=2 May 2008|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coatlicue]], the Goddess of earth and death, was portrayed with a necklace of human hearts, hands and a skull pendant. She was imbued with the drama and grandeur necessary to dazzle the subject people and to convey the image of an implacable state. The worship of death involved worship of life, while the skull – symbol of death – was a promise to resurrection. The Aztecs carved skulls in monoliths of lava, and made masks of [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] and jade. Furthermore, the skull motif was used in decoration. They were molded on pots, traced on scrolls, woven into garments, and formalized into hieroglyphs.

==Spanish invasion==
When the Spanish invaded and conquered [[Tenochtitlan]] in the sixteenth century, they imposed the  [[Catholic]] religion and Spanish folk-practices of the era. This included the pagan tradition of celebrating the dead with food-offerings and feasts. However, the Spanish priests were eager to discontinue these ancient traditions that found fertile ground in Mexico. The Spanish suppressed the Mexican skull art tradition because it was too ''Indito'' or pagan for their refined European tastes. Not until Mexico won its independence from Spain in 1821, did skull art begin to re-emerge as a symbol of ''Mexicanidad''.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Reign of Porfirio Díaz==
When [[Porfirio Díaz]] became president, he was burdened with a bankrupt economy. To help the economic situation in Mexico, Díaz encouraged foreign investments. Investors were pleased with Mexico's cheap labor force. The Mexican–Indian laborer worked under cruel conditions. [[José Guadalupe Posada]], Mexican engraver, with his drawing criticized the conditions in Mexico.
Jose Guadalupe Posada is probably the most important Mexican artist of our times. During his lifetime, Posada was a witness to the crucial social and political changes which shaped Mexico into a modern nation. Changes such as the downfall of a dictator, a wide – spread social revolution, and the struggle for a power combined with the birth of a democratic process, all these experiences deeply influenced him. Through his work, he documented these occurrences and became a pictorial historian.

==José Guadalupe Posada==
[[File:Posada1.Quijote.jpeg|thumb|Posada's Skull art was a chilling message]]
Posada's drawings brought an awakening to the common man. He made those who could not read to understand what was happening in their country. Although the use of skulls and skeletons in art had been suppressed by foreign influences, it was still recognized among the poor in their celebrations of the Day of the Dead.
Using skull art was Posada's way to make a connection with the popular audience. Reproduced on box lids is his most famous engraving – [[la Calavera Catrina]] – which shows a fashionable lady in the guise of a skeleton. [[Diego Rivera]] called José Guadalupe Posada the greatest Mexican people's artist. From this influence, Rivera painted common people living and working in their environment. His work also carried a social message.
Posada and Rivera deeply influenced the Jaliscano [[Jorge González Camarena]], who disregarded the traditional methods and embraced the popular art of Posada and Rivera. Recurring battle scenes appear in González Camarena's work where Revolutionary soldiers become part of the ancient Mexican history as their lifeless bodies change into skeletons.[[File:Gran calavera eléctrica2.jpg|thumb|José Guadalupe Posada's version of Skull art used as a political message to those who did not know how to read.]]

==Frida Kahlo==
[[Frida Kahlo]] was also the product of a bold and brilliant generation that looked back with devotion to its Mexican roots and valued the reality it found there, uncontaminated by foreign influence. She admitted having a great deal of admiration for her husband's work, as well as that of Jose Guadalupe Posada and she found great beauty in the highly developed pre-Conquest indigenous art.

==Surrealists==
Frida was claimed early on by [[André Breton]] and the Surrealists as one of their own, and for a time she did not mind to be caught up and identified with the chic vanguard movement. But, later she declared herself not one of them because she said "I painted dreams, I painted my own reality." In the 1940s she painted "The Dream," where a conscious skeleton floats above the sleeping Frida. The Mexican brujos say "to live is to sleep and to die is to awaken." For Frida, perhaps, death like dreams exists in parallel.
[[File:The Kid - Diego Rivera.jpg|thumb|[[Diego Rivera]]'s Skull art expression]]

==Chucho Reyes==
While Frida's work focused on ''Mexicanidad'', Chucho Reyes integrated European fine art styles with the essence of the popular Mexican skull art. Perhaps his art was politically unpopular for those who chose to disregard foreign influences. However, Reye's unconventional combination was most likely influenced by his eccentric father who, although devoutly Catholic, practiced [[brujeria]]. He slept in a bed where [[rooster]]s were tied to each bedpost and a large eye was painted above his bed on the ceiling. This mixture of European religious beliefs with Mexican witchcraft was what most likely inspired Reyes to combine different artistic styles. Art like this will take quite a while to master

==Superstitions and saints==
Although modernly the ancient Aztec religious traditions that have remained are called brujeria by those who practice European religions, in [[Oaxaca]] – superstitions and saints are spoken in the same breath.

==Rufino Tamayo &amp; the Oaxacan School==
[[Rufino Tamayo]] founded the Oaxacan school of painting on the principle that although painting must take place on the plastic level, it does not exclude the possibility that the work contain a profound consequence not altogether expressed. Tamayo seemed to strip away man's external self, found for instance in religion, in order to examine man's fundamental fears. His fear of nature, of the cosmos, and above everything else, man's fear of himself. The subtle and rich art of pre-Columbian times greatly inspired Tamayo. From this influence he painted man as a transparent flesh existing on a living skeleton.

==Francisco Toledo==
On the other hand, [[Francisco Toledo]] painted his subjects as if they were x-rays. Salacious curiosity with the inner being becomes almost pornographic as his erotic and irreverent resurgence of Skull Art comes forward.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image: La Muerte Agachada.jpg|thumb|Francisco Toledo's La Muerte Agachada (Falling over with laughter)]] --&gt;

==Rodolfo Nieto==
While Rufino Tamayo founded the Oaxacan School, it was [[Rodolfo Nieto]][http://www.RodolfoNieto.com] who defined it. Rodolfo added a dramatic tone to skull art. Using light colors fixed against dark hues, he showed the continual battle of life and death. With gaiety, humor, whimsies, and boyhood stories of [[Tarzan]] the Ape Man fighting the perils of the jungle, Rodolfo laughed at death while living in the shadows of his own deepening depression.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Flashes of light confused by color, juxtaposed against the stark black canvasses, he did not attempt to define human existence, but just to live it, knowing that the skull was always within him.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  His painter wife Nancy Nieto removed the fleshy mask of life in order to examine the basis of life, the skull and skeleton..... &lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image: Calavera de Monzo.jpg|thumb|Rodolfo Nieto's "Calavera de Monzo" preception of Skull Art, a way he laughed at his own approaching death]] --&gt;

==Chicano / Mexican – American==
Often Chicano or Mexican American artists turn to their history, recently and notably Nancy Nieto brings a bold resurgence to the ancient tradition of Mexican skull art.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:La Musica.jpg|thumb|Nancy Nieto's La Musica]]--&gt; Woven into a veil of rich colors and unconventional forms, adopted from the Oaxacan School, her work removes the veil of mystery the mystery of life only to reveal the mystery of death. She shows depths of mystery yet has a harmonious eurhythmic note of the epic origins of the chromatic [[Oaxaca]]. She struggles to re-address Francisco Toledo's erotic themes, and to step away from Rodolfo Nieto's dramatic tomes. Her work renews the Aztec view of death as a transitional cycle between the individual life and the ubiquitous "to be".

The '''Southland Art Foundation''', established in 1995, is a [[Southland, New Zealand]] art foundation that provides funding for a variety of art programs and scholarships for New Zealand artists. It was the successor to the Trustbank Southland Art Foundation, created by former [[Southland Museum and Art Gallery]] Chairman, Dr Alf Poole CBE and former Southland Museum and Art Gallery Director, Russell Beck.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/118-1222/1665/,   Journal of the New Zealand Medical Association, 16-September-2005, Vol 118 No 1222, Alfred Philip Poole, Retrieved March 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==William Hodges Fellowship==

The Southland Art Foundation 'Artist in Residence' programme began in 1996,&lt;ref name=beehive&gt;http://www.beehive.govt.nz/speech/opening-burwell-house-artist039s-residence-invercargill, Opening of Burwell House, Artist's Residence, Invercargill , Judith Tizard, Retrieved March 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; having been proposed and developed by Michael A R Anderson, Head of Art Faculty, Southern Institute of Technology and by Wayne P Marriott, Art Gallery Manager, Southland Museum &amp; Art Gallery, .

Southland had previously hosted a number of one off opportunities for New Zealand artists to work in the region, during the 1980s. These had been the work of Russell Beck and Dr Alf Poole, former Director and former Chair, Southland Museum and Art Gallery. This culminated in 1990 with the Art in the Sub-Antarctic programme, which provided an opportunity for Bill Hammond, Geerda Leenards, Shaun Burdon, Chester Nealie, Helen Mitchell, Lloyd Godman and Laurence Aberhardt, amongst others to participate in the joint Museum and DOC residency on the Sub-Antarctic Islands. Godman proposed the concept of the project as far back as 1984 and was instrumental in the organization as was Lou Sanson, Conservator for the Southland Conservancy in charge of Fiordland National Park, Stewart Island and the Subantarctic World Heritage Area.

Anderson saw the residency as an opportunity to expose the Southland community, and the students of the Southern Institute of Technology, to the creative genius of some of New Zealand's greatest living artists.

Artists are required to spend time at the Southern Institute of Technology and also to work in and around Southland.

In 1999 the Trustees–Shirley Palmer, Gwen Neave, Russell Beck and Wayne P Marriott resolved to rename the Artist in Residence programme the [[William Hodges Fellowship]]. This was in recognition of the acquisition of [[William Hodges]] "Maori before a Waterfall", 1773 by the Southland Museum and Art Gallery in 1998. Hodges was regarded as the first artist in residence in Southland, having depicted the flora, fauna and people of the region during [[Captain Cook]]'s second voyage to New Zealand.

==Burwell House==

In 2000, Burwell House, a former 1878 Doctors residence of Invercargill Public Hospital was converted into a residence and studio for artists, and officially opened by Hon. [[Judith Tizard]], Associate Minister, Arts, Culture and Heritage that year.&lt;ref name=beehive/&gt;

The original architect was F W Burwell; Burwell House was constructed in 1879.&lt;ref name=historic&gt;http://www.historic.org.nz/TheRegister/RegisterSearch/RegisterResults.aspx?RID=7777&amp;m=advanced, Dee Street Hospital (Former), Retrieved March 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Southland Museum and Art Gallery leased the property in 1988 and undertook some external restoration on the buildings. It used the Central Block for storage and in 2000 refurbished the South Wing for use as the accommodation for the artist-in-residence program.&lt;ref name=historic/&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Swetnam the Woman-Hater Arraigned by Women''''' is a [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] era stage play, an anonymous comedy that was part of an [[Feminism|anti-feminist]] controversy of the 1615–20 period.
{{TOC right}}

==Performance and publication==
''Swetnam the Woman-Hater'' was first published in 1620, in a [[book size|quarto]] issued by [[Richard Meighen]]. The title page of the quarto states that the play was performed by [[Queen Anne's Men]] at the [[Red Bull Theatre]]; the most likely date for the first performance is considered to have been in late 1618 or 1619. The play was not reprinted in its own era (in fact, not until 1880); but it was revived onstage around 1633.&lt;ref&gt;Logan and Smith, pp. 211–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one key respect, the Red Bull Theatre was an odd venue for the play ''Swetnam'' and its positive and genteel attitude toward women. The Red Bull had a reputation as the roughest and rowdiest of the theatres of its day, and at least one source suggests that some women avoided it. According to a contemporaneous doggerel,&lt;ref&gt;Grosart, p. xxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;The Red Bull
Is mostly full
Of drovers, carriers, carters;
But honest wenches
Will shun the benches
And not there show their garters.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perhaps the Red Bull audience mellowed with time; or perhaps it was never as narrow and mean as reputed, as [[A. B. Grosart]] suggests in his edition of the play.&lt;ref&gt;Grosart, p. xxxvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, Queen Anne's Men may have chosen the play to appeal to the "up-scale" new audience they wanted to serve. In 1617, the Queen Anne's company moved from the open-air, "public" Red Bull to the enclosed "private" theatre the [[Cockpit Theatre|Cockpit]], which had a more "elite" clientele. But the crowds of apprentices who made up a large portion of the company's audience were outraged at the move. The private theatres' ticket prices were five or six times higher than the public theatres' admission fees. (In the [[Jacobean era]], the cheapest ticket to the "public" [[Globe Theatre]] was a penny, while the minimum for the "private" [[Blackfriars Theatre]] was sixpence.) The young men were being priced out of their basic entertainment. In the famous [[Shrove Tuesday]] riot of 1617, the 'prentices damaged the Cockpit badly enough to delay its opening, and the Queen's Men had to remain at the Red Bull until repairs were done. ''Swetnam'' may have been the kind of play the company intended for their projected new home at the Cockpit.

==Controversy==
The play was one item, and apparently the final one, in a controversy that erupted in 1615 with the publication of [[Joseph Swetnam]]'s crude anti-feminist tract ''The Arraignment of Lewd, Idle, Froward, and Unconstant Women.'' Swetnam's work attracted abundant attention, and provoked three responses in defence of women: [[Rachel Speght]]'s ''A Muzzle for Melastomus''&lt;ref&gt;"Melastomus" means "black mouth," indicated the "foul-mouthed" Swetnam.&lt;/ref&gt; (1617), and two works published under pseudonyms—''Esther Hath Hang'd Haman'' by "Esther Sowernam"  and ''The Worming of a Mad Dog'' by "Constantia Munda" (both also 1617).&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Tuvil's ''Asylum Veneris'' (1616) is sometimes considered another response to Swetnam.&lt;/ref&gt; The pseudonyms are thought to represent other female authors, making this polemical response to Swetnam a rare cluster of early 17th-century works written by women. The play ''Swetnam the Woman-Hater'' shows internal signs of being the final response to Swetnam in the relevant period.&lt;ref&gt;Logan and Smith, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, ''Swetnam the Woman-Hater'' is one of a long-running series of [[English Renaissance theatre|English Renaissance plays]] on what can be called, very broadly, the gender question. Earlier plays in this subgenre would include [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' and [[Beaumont and Fletcher]]'s ''[[The Woman Hater]]'' and ''[[The Woman's Prize]].'' Beyond the confines of the drama, there was an abundant literature on the subject. Swetnam's tract was only one in a long series of similar attacks on women; countervailing defences of women were less common though not unknown—as in ''Protection for Women'' (1589), by "Jane Anger," and ''The Worth of Women: Wherein is Clearly Revealed Their Nobility and Their Superiority to Men'' (1600), by "[[Moderata Fonte]]" (both pseudonyms).

==Plot source==
The play's subplot deals with Swetnam, who is brought to trial before a court of women for his offences against the gender and ends up recanting his bias. The play's main plot, a story of political intrigue and courtly love, derives from a novel by [[Juan de Flores]] called the ''Historia de Aurelio e Isabella'' (also known as ''Grisel y Mirabella''), written c. 1495. (The same novel provided [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] with plot material for his ''[[Women Pleased]]''.) De Flore's novel was popular, and had been published in English translation five times between [[16th century in literature|1556]] and 1586. It has been argued that the play also shows specific debts to earlier dramas, notably [[George Peele]]'s ''The Arraignment of Paris'' and [[John Lyly]]'s ''[[Endymion (play)|Endymion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Logan and Smith, pp. 210–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tone of de Flores' novel is strongly chivalric, a trait that carries over into the play. "''Swetnam the Woman-Hater'' is remarkable for the unusually high moral tone it adopts with regard to women."&lt;ref&gt;Gosse, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
No external evidence indicates the identity of the play's author; [[Thomas Heywood]], [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]], and [[Thomas Drue]] have been proposed as candidates. (A "Thomas Drewe" acted with Queen Anne's Men in the years 1616–19; but it is not certain that Drew the actor, and Drue the playwright of ''The Duchess of Suffolk,'' were the same person.) Heywood is regarded as the best candidate for the author of ''Swetnam'': "the language, dialogue, and clownery" of ''Swetnam'' are all typical of Heywood's style.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Wright, quoted in Logan and Smith, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The play is set in [[Sicily]], where the royal court is a grim and somber place: King Atticus is mourning the death of his eldest son and heir, Lusippus, and the prolonged absence of his second son Lorenzo. In the middle of the opening scene, news arrives that Lorenzo is missing after fighting in the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] (1571), and is feared to be either dead or captured by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]].

The king also has a daughter, the beautiful and spirited Leonida. Yet Atticus is displeased with her: the scions of the great royal houses of Europe have come to seek her hand in marriage, but she has imperiously refused them all. The king calls her "wanton, coy, and fickle too;" he decides to punish her by restricting her social access, and puts her in the custody of his senior courtier, Nicanor. Nicanor quickly reveals himself to be both the play's villain and its [[Senex#Senex in literature|senex]]: though an old man himself, he wants to marry Leonida and so become king after Atticus.

The second scene introduces Swetnam and his servant Swash, the play's clown. The conceit is that Swetnam has been driven out of England by the public's righteous indignation over his anti-female slanders; he has moved to Sicily and taken to calling himself Misogynos. (The play provides the earliest known use in English of the term "misogynist.") Once in Sicily, however, he has fallen back into his old habit of traducing women, and is becoming notorious in his new country just as he was in his old.

(The play's two opening scenes create an obvious conflict in chronology: the dramatist postulates a future, post-England Swetnam, but tosses him into 1570s Sicily. Yet such anomalies are only too common in English Renaissance drama. For extreme examples of historical anomalies and chronological conflict, see ''[[The Faithful Friends]]'' and ''[[The Old Law]].'')

Meanwhile, the missing prince, Lorenzo, has returned clandestinely to Sicily; he wants to spy out local conditions and corruptions, unhindered by his fame and high position. Only the loyal courtier Iago is aware of his presence.

Princess Leonida's current suitor is the Spanish prince, Lisandro; when Leonida is restricted from seeing him, he decides to take the bold step of masquerading as her confessor, Friar Anthony, to see her. His ardor and persistence create an impression on the young princess, and he wins her affection. But Nicanor catches the two of them together. The young couple are put on trial for violating the king's command; in the classic [[fairy tale]] tradition, the penalty they face is death. Yet at their trial, both of the accused accept blame for the infraction and exonerate the other. The judges complain to the king that they cannot decide; the king decrees that the matter will be resolved by a debate or disputation on the question of whether men or women are the morally weaker gender.

Swetnam/Misogynos is delighted to take the male side in the dispute; the women's side is taken by Lorenzo, who has disguised himself "like an Amazon." The debate is vigorous, and Lorenzo-alias-"Atlanta" does well; but the judges are all male, and Nicanor uses his corrupting influence to turn the outcome in Swetnam's favour. True to his word, Atticus condemns his daughter to death; Lisandro is sentenced to exile. In the aftermath of the debate, Swetnam surprisingly makes romantic advances to "Atlanta." To his servant Swash, Swetnam reveals that he is in the grip of lust rather than love; but the effect is highly comic all the same. In his pursuit of "Atlanta," Swetnam exposes himself to the revenge of the Sicilian women; they capture him, imprison him, and force him to recant and repent his bigotry against them.

The play takes a specific approach to Swetnam's bias, judging his low opinion of women as a reflection of his own low quality as a human being. As Iago puts it,

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;::::::He's a man,
Whose breeding has been like the [[Dung beetle|Scarrabee]],
Altogether upon the excrement of the time;
And being swol'n with poisonous vapours
He breaks wind in public, to blast the
Reputation of all women; his acquaintance
Has been altogether amongst whores and bawds,
And therefore speaks but in's own element.
His own unworthy foul deformity,
Because no female can affect the same,
Begets in him despair; and despair, envy.
He cares not to defame their very souls,
But that he's of the Turk's opinion: they have none.&lt;ref&gt;Spellings modernized. The last two lines refer to the common belief among Europeans that Muslims thought that women had no souls.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the main plot, Lorenzo and Iago stage a pretended execution of Leonida. When Lisandro sees a mock-up of her supposedly severed head, he stabs himself in a suicide attempt; his guards, fearing punishment, flee, and Lorenzo and Iago secure his wounded body and nurse him back to health. In the play's final scene, the disaffected court party, including Lorenzo, Iago, Leonida and Lisandro, and Queen Aurelia, stage a [[masque]] on the theme of repentance; Atticus is affected, emotionally and psychologically, by the masque, and expresses his own repentance over his course of action. Once that change of heart has been achieved, Lorenzo, Leonida, and Lisandro can reveal themselves. Nicanor's villainy is exposed, and he too repents; in the spirit of the moment, the king forgives him, and urges him to "live honestly." Leonida and Lisandro can now engage to marry, and Lorenzo is the new crown prince.

[The play text presents interesting questions as to its original staging, like the mock severed head of Leonida. How was Lorenzo costumed as an "Amazon," and how did the audience interpret and understand his disguise?]

==Modern responses==
The play's status as a pro-feminist, proto-feminist, or quasi-feminist text has earned it an ever-growing body of commentary, analysis, and criticism from modern scholars. Some attention has focused on the degree to which the play is or isn't a feminist work; critics have noted that ''Swetnam'' subordinates its polemical concerns to its subplot, while the main plot deals with high-flown romantic love.

The play was produced in 2004, in what is believed to be its US premiere, by the Airmid Theatre Company (www.airmidtheatre.org) as part of the Play Outside festival in New York City.

'''''The Harvest Wagon''''' is the name of two paintings by the English artist [[Thomas Gainsborough]]. The first was done around 1767 and is today owned by the [[Barber Institute of Fine Arts]], in [[Birmingham, England]]. The later painting was done around 1784 and is part of the collection of the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]]. The later painting is the better known of the two. It was donated to the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] by [[Frank P Wood]]. It is one of the most prominent pieces in the collection of the AGO.&lt;ref&gt;John Bentley Mays. "Back to the land with Turner and Gainsborough." ''The Globe and Mail.'' Toronto, Ont.: Jul 29, 1995. pg. C.16&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both paintings depict a group of peasants riding inside a simple wagon through a rural landscape with a collection of nearby animals. A young boy leads the wagon, while a man helps lift a young woman aboard. The painting is set in the area around Gainsborough's adopted city of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], where he lived for 14 years of his life. In 1995 the two museums collaborated on a joint show that displayed the two versions side by side, first on display in England and then in Canada.  

The two paintings of a similar subject done some seventeen years apart show the evolution of Gainsborough as an artist. The later painting is more sedate, the figures more composed and less excited. The Gainsborough scholar Hugh Besley sees landscape, people, and animals as more unified in the later work. He also sees more influence of Rubens on Gainsborough's style and technique, particularly of Rubens's ''[[The Descent from the Cross (Rubens)|The Descent from the Cross]]''. The woman ascending to the wagon shows a motion opposite to Christ's. Christina Payne has commented on some of the symbolism in the 1784 work, noting that the broken pitcher placed in front of the pregnant passenger may be a symbol of virginity.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Besley. "Gainsborough's Harvest Wagons: Toronto and Birmingham." ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'' Vol. 137, No. 1109 (Aug., 1995), pp. 574-575.&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier painting is also far more intimate to the artist as the women in the wagon are portraits of Gainsborough's own daughters, Mary and Margaret.&lt;ref&gt;Meryle Secrest. ''Duveen: A Life in Art.'' University of Chicago Press, 2004 pg. 297&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first work could not find a buyer, perhaps being too ribald for the art market of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Short ''The English Rural Community: Image and Analysis.'' CUP Archive, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  It was given to Gainsborough's friend Wiltshire, a mover who transported Gainsborough's paintings from Bath to exhibitions in London. Wiltshire's horses had also served as the model of the animals in the picture. The painting remained in Wiltshire's family until his grandson sold it in 1867.

The second painting, done at the height of Gainsborough's fame, was sold to the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]], later to become King George IV. It later became part of the collection of American steel magnate [[Elbert Henry Gary]]. Upon Gary's death in 1927 his collection was auctioned off, and ''The Harvest Wagon'' was one of the most sought-after works.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,786363,00.html Art: Gary's Gainsborough]" ''Time'' Apr. 30, 1928&lt;/ref&gt; After a competitive auction it was purchased by art dealer [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen|Joseph Duveen]] for $360,000, then the highest price ever paid at auction for a painting in the United States. Duveen later sold it to Canadian art collector [[Frank P. Wood]] for $450,000, and Wood then donated it to the Art Gallery of Ontario. In 1959 the painting was somewhat damaged during an attempted robbery when the thieves tried to cut the painting out of its frame.&lt;ref&gt; Hugh McLeave ''Rogues in the Gallery: The Modern Plague of Art Thefts'' C&amp;M Online Media, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Middle Years''''' is an incomplete book of autobiography by [[Henry James]], posthumously published in 1917. The book covers the early years of James' residence in Europe and his meetings with writers such as [[George Eliot]], [[Alfred Tennyson]], and [[James Russell Lowell]].

==Summary and themes==
The seven chapters of this fragment show promise as a record of James' young manhood in Europe. He met many of the leading writers of the day, though his opinions of them were not always flattering. Tennyson he found rather dull and commonplace, not at all the fine mind he expected. The [[poetry|poet's]] reading of ''Locksley Hall'' left James unimpressed.

George Eliot appealed much more to James with her interesting conversation and alert consideration of ideas. James tells a story of how he helped summon a doctor when George Eliot's injured stepson required urgent medical aid. He compliments the novelist on how carefully she attended to the young man.

James also has much to say about the London of his first impressions: the rooms he stayed in, the Londoners he talked with on the streets, the theaters and museums he visited. The fragment concludes with a remembrance of Lady Waterford, a painter who possessed "that combination of rare beauty and rare talent which the [[Victorian era|Victorian age]] had for many years not ceased to acclaim."

'''''The Prince''''' ({{lang-it|Il Principe}} {{IPA-it|il ˈprintʃipe|}}) is a 16th-century political [[discourse|treatise]] by the Italian diplomat and [[Political philosophy|political theorist]] [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]. From correspondence a version appears to have been distributed in 1513, using a Latin title, ''De Principatibus'' (''Of Principalities'').&lt;ref&gt;He wrote about a short study he was making by this Latin name in his letter to [[Francesco Vettori]], written 10 Dec 1513. This is letter 224 in the translated correspondence edition of James B. Atkinson and David Sices: {{Harvcoltxt|Machiavelli|1996|page=264}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the printed version was not published until 1532, five years after Machiavelli's death. This was done with the permission of the [[Medici]] pope [[Clement VII]], but "long before then, in fact since the first appearance of ''The Prince'' in manuscript, controversy had swirled about his writings".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990}} p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was written as if it were a traditional work in the ''[[mirrors for princes]]'' style, it is generally agreed that it was especially innovative. This is only partly because it was written in the vernacular Italian rather than Latin, a practice which had become increasingly popular since the publication of Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' and other works of Renaissance literature.&lt;ref name="ITALIAN VERNACULAR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/06.html |title=Italian Vernacular Literature |work=Vlib.iue.it |accessdate=2012-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gilbert|1938}} emphasizes similarities between ''The Prince'' and its forerunners, but still sees the same innovations as other commentators.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Prince'' is sometimes claimed to be one of the first works of [[modern philosophy]], especially modern [[political philosophy]], in which the effective truth is taken to be more important than any abstract ideal. It was also in direct conflict with the dominant Catholic and [[scholasticism|scholastic]] doctrines of the time concerning politics and ethics.&lt;ref name=counter&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Although Machiavelli makes many references to classical sources, these do not include the customary deference to [[Aristotle]] which was to some extent approved by the church in his time. {{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1958|p=222}} says that "Machiavelli indicates his fundamental disagreement with Aristotle's doctrine of the whole by substituting "[[Chance (Ancient Greek concept)|chance]]" (''caso'') for "[[Nature (philosophy)|nature]]" in the only context in which he speaks of "the beginning of the world." Strauss gives evidence that Machiavelli was knowingly influenced by [[Democritus]], whose philosophy of nature was, like that of [[modern science]], [[materialism|materialist]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is relatively short, the treatise is the most remembered of Machiavelli's works and the one most responsible for bringing the word "[[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian]]" into usage as a pejorative. It even contributed to the modern negative connotations of the words "politics" and "politician" in western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of subject matter it overlaps with the much longer ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'', which was written a few years later. In its use of near-contemporary Italians as examples of people who perpetrated criminal deeds for politics, another lesser-known work by Machiavelli which ''The Prince'' has been compared to is the ''[[Life of Castruccio Castracani]]''.

The descriptions within ''The Prince'' have the general theme of accepting that the aims of princes – such as glory and survival – can justify the use of immoral means to achieve those ends:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1987|p=297}}: "Machiavelli is the only political thinker whose name has come into common use for designating a kind of politics, which exists and will continue to exist independently of his influence, a politics guided exclusively by considerations of expediency, which uses all means, fair or foul, iron or poison, for achieving its ends – its end being the aggrandizement of one's country or fatherland – but also using the fatherland in the service of the self-aggrandizement of the politician or statesman or one's party."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
Each part of ''The Prince'' has been commented on over centuries. The work has a recognizable structure, for the most part indicated by the author himself. It can be summarized as follows:&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{Harvcoltxt|de Alvarez|1999}} p. viii; and {{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1958|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The subject matter: New Princedoms (Chapters 1 &amp; 2)===
''The Prince'' starts by describing the subject matter it will handle. In the first sentence Machiavelli uses the word "[[state (polity)|state]]" (Italian ''stato'' which could also mean "[[wikt:status|status]]") in order to neutrally cover "all forms of organization of supreme political power, whether republican or princely". The way in which the word state came to acquire this modern type of meaning during the [[Renaissance]] has been the subject of many academic discussions, with this sentence and similar ones in the works of Machiavelli being considered particularly important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Guarini|1999|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Machiavelli said that ''The Prince'' would be about princedoms, mentioning that he has written about republics elsewhere (possibly referring to the ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'' although this is debated), but in fact he mixes discussion of republics into this in many places, effectively treating republics as a type of princedom also, and one with many strengths. More importantly, and less traditionally, he distinguishes new princedoms from hereditary established princedoms.&lt;ref name=Ch1&gt;{{Citation|last=Machiavelli |url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/machiavelli/niccolo/m149p/chapter1.html/ |chapter=Chapter 1 |title=The Prince |publisher=Constitution.org |accessdate=2010-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908090132/https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/machiavelli/niccolo/m149p/chapter1.html |archivedate=2015-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He deals with hereditary princedoms quickly in Chapter 2, saying that they are much easier to rule. For such a prince, "unless extraordinary vices cause him to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects will be naturally well disposed towards him".&lt;ref name=Ch2&gt;{{Citation|last=Machiavelli |url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/machiavelli/niccolo/m149p/chapter2.html/ |chapter=Chapter 2 |title=The Prince |publisher=Constitution.org |accessdate=2010-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908092012/https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/machiavelli/niccolo/m149p/chapter2.html |archivedate=2015-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Harvcoltxt|Gilbert|1938|pp=19–23}}, comparing this to traditional presentations of advice for princes, wrote that the novelty in chapters 1 and 2 is the "deliberate purpose of dealing with a new ruler who will need to establish himself in defiance of custom". Normally, these types of works were addressed only to hereditary princes. He thinks Machiavelli may have been influenced by [[Tacitus]] as well as his own experience, but finds no clear predecessor for this.

This categorization of regime types is also "un-Aristotelian"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gilbert|1938|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and apparently simpler than the traditional one found for example in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Aristotle (Politics)|Politics]]'', which divides [[regime]]s into those ruled by a single monarch, an [[oligarchy]], or by the people, in a [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|de Alvarez|1999}} p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; He also ignores the classical distinctions between the good and corrupt forms, for example between monarchy and tyranny.

[[Xenophon]], on the other hand, made exactly the same distinction between types of rulers in the beginning  of his ''[[Education of Cyrus]]'' where he says that, concerning the knowledge of how to rule human beings, [[Cyrus the Great]], his exemplary prince, was very different "from all other kings, both those who have inherited their thrones from their fathers and those who have gained their crowns by their own efforts".&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Cyropaedia'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0204%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D4 1.1.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Machiavelli divides the subject of new states into two types, "mixed" cases and purely new states.

==="Mixed" princedoms (Chapters 3–5)===
New princedoms are either totally new, or they are “mixed” meaning that they are new parts of an older state, already belonging to that prince.&lt;ref name=Ch3&gt;{{Citation|last=Machiavelli |url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/machiavelli/niccolo/m149p/chapter3.html/ |chapter=Chapter 3 |title=The Prince |publisher=Constitution.org |accessdate=2010-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911052022/https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/machiavelli/niccolo/m149p/chapter3.html |archivedate=2015-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New conquests added to older states (Chapter 3)====
Machiavelli generalizes that there were several virtuous Roman ways to hold a newly acquired province, using a republic as an example of how new princes can act:
* to install one's princedom in the new acquisition, or to install colonies of one's people there, which is better.
* to indulge the lesser powers of the area without increasing their power.
* to put down the powerful people.
* not to allow a foreign power to gain reputation.

More generally, Machiavelli emphasizes that one should have regard not only for present problems but also for the future ones. One should not “enjoy the benefit of time” but rather the benefit of one's virtue and prudence, because time can bring evil as well as good.

====Conquered kingdoms (Chapter 4)====
[[File:The Family of Darius before Alexander by Paolo Veronese 1570 fragment.jpg|right|thumb|A 16th-century Italian impression of the family of [[Darius III]], emperor of [[Persia]], before their conqueror, [[Alexander the Great]]. Machiavelli explained that in his time the [[Near East]] was again ruled by an empire, the [[Ottoman Empire]], with similar characteristics to that of Darius – seen from the viewpoint of a potential conqueror.]]

In some cases the old king of the conquered kingdom depended on his lords. 16th century France, or in other words France as it was at the time of writing of ''The Prince'', is given by Machiavelli as an example of such a kingdom. These are easy to enter but difficult to hold.

When the kingdom revolves around the king, with everyone else his servant, then it is difficult to enter but easy to hold. The solution is to eliminate the old bloodline of the prince. Machiavelli used the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian empire]] of [[Darius III]], conquered by [[Alexander the Great]], to illustrate this point and then noted that the Medici, if they think about it, will find this historical example similar to the "kingdom of the Turk" ([[Ottoman Empire]]) in their time – making this a potentially easier conquest to hold than France would be.

====Conquered Free States, with their own laws and orders (Chapter 5)====
{{Harvcoltxt|Gilbert|1938|p=34}} notes that this chapter is quite atypical of any previous books for princes. Gilbert supposed the need to discuss conquering free republics is linked to Machiavelli's project to unite Italy, which contained some free republics. As he also notes, the chapter in any case makes it clear that holding such a state is highly difficult for a prince. Machiavelli gives three options:
* Ruin them, as Rome destroyed [[Carthage]], and also as Machiavelli says the Romans eventually had to do in Greece, even though they had wanted to avoid it.
* Go to live there (or install colonies, if you are a prince of a republic).
* Let them keep their own orders but install a puppet regime.

===Totally New States (Chapters 6–9)===

====Conquests by virtue (Chapter 6)====
[[File:Moses dore.jpg|thumb|left| Machiavelli described [[Moses]] as a conquering prince, who founded new modes and orders by force of arms, which he used willingly to kill many of his own people. The Bible describes the reasons behind his success differently.]]
Princes who rise to power through their own skill and resources (their "virtue") rather than luck tend to have a hard time rising to the top, but once they reach the top they are very secure in their position.  This is because they effectively crush their opponents and earn great respect from everyone else.  Because they are strong and more self-sufficient, they have to make fewer compromises with their allies.

Machiavelli writes that reforming an existing order is one of the most dangerous and difficult things a prince can do. Part of the reason is that people are naturally resistant to change and reform. Those who benefited from the old order will resist change very fiercely. By contrast, those who can benefit from the new order will be less fierce in their support, because the new order is unfamiliar and they are not certain it will live up to its promises.  Moreover, it is impossible for the prince to satisfy everybody's expectations. Inevitably, he will disappoint some of his followers. Therefore, a prince must have the means to force his supporters to keep supporting him even when they start having second thoughts, otherwise he will lose his power. Only armed prophets, like Moses, succeed in bringing lasting change. Machiavelli claims that Moses killed uncountable numbers of his own people in order to enforce his will.

Machiavelli was not the first thinker to notice this pattern. Allan Gilbert wrote: "In wishing new laws and yet seeing danger in them Machiavelli was not himself an innovator,"&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert. ''Machiavelli's Prince and Its Forerunners''. pg 39&lt;/ref&gt; because this idea was traditional and could be found in [[Aristotle]]'s writings. But Machiavelli went much further than any other author in his emphasis on this aim, and Gilbert associates Machiavelli's emphasis upon such drastic aims with the level of corruption to be found in Italy.

====Conquest by fortune, meaning by someone else’s virtue (Chapter 7)====
According to Machiavelli, when a prince comes to power through luck or the blessings of powerful figures within the regime, he typically has an easy time gaining power but a hard time keeping it thereafter, because his power is dependent on his benefactors' goodwill. He does not command the loyalty of the armies and officials that maintain his authority, and these can be withdrawn from him at a whim. Having risen the easy way, it is not even certain such a prince has the skill and strength to stand on his own feet.

This is not necessarily true in every case.  Machiavelli cites [[Cesare Borgia]] as an example of a lucky prince who escaped this pattern.  Through cunning political manoeuvrers, he managed to secure his power base.  Cesare was made commander of the papal armies by his father, [[Pope Alexander VI]], but was also heavily dependent on mercenary armies loyal to the Orsini brothers and the support of the French king.  Borgia won over the allegiance of the Orsini brothers' followers with better pay and prestigious government posts.  When some of his mercenary captains started to plot against him, he had them imprisoned and executed. When it looked as though the king of France would abandon him, Borgia sought new alliances.

Finally, Machiavelli makes a point that bringing new benefits to a conquered people will not be enough to cancel the memory of old injuries, an idea Allan Gilbert said can be found in [[Tacitus]] and [[Seneca the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert. ''Machiavelli's Prince and Its Forerunners''. pg 48&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conquests by “criminal virtue” (Chapter 8)====
Conquests by "criminal virtue" are ones in which the new prince secures his power through cruel, immoral deeds, such as the execution of political rivals.  Machiavelli advises that a prince should carefully calculate all the wicked deeds he needs to do to secure his power, and then execute them all in one stroke, such that he need not commit any more wickedness for the rest of his reign.  In this way, his subjects will slowly forget his cruel deeds and his reputation can recover. Princes who fail to do this, who hesitate in their ruthlessness, find that their problems mushroom over time and they are forced to commit wicked deeds throughout their reign. Thus  they continuously mar their reputations and alienate their people.

Machiavelli's case study is [[Agathocles of Syracuse]].  After Agathocles became Praetor of Syracuse, he called a meeting of the city's elite.  At his signal, his soldiers killed all the senators and the wealthiest citizens, completely destroying the old oligarchy. He declared himself ruler with no opposition. So secure was his power that he could afford to absent himself to go off on military campaigns in Africa.

However, Machiavelli then strongly rebukes Agathocles, stating, "Yet one cannot call it virtue to kill one's citizens, betray one's friends, to be without faith, without mercy, without religion; these modes can enable one to acquire empire, but not glory. [...] Nonetheless, his savage cruelty and inhumanity, together with his infinite crimes, do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent men.  Thus, one cannot attribute to fortune or virtue what he achieved without either."

{{Harvcoltxt|Gilbert|1938|pp=51–55}} remarks that this chapter is even less traditional than those it follows, not only in its treatment of criminal behavior, but also in the advice to take power from people at a stroke, noting that precisely the opposite had been advised by Aristotle in his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' (5.11.1315a13). On the other hand, Gilbert shows that another piece of advice in this chapter, to give benefits when it will not appear forced, was traditional.

====Becoming a prince by the selection of one's fellow citizens (Chapter 9)====
A "civil principality" is one in which a citizen comes to power "not through crime or other intolerable violence", but by the support of his fellow citizens. This, he says, does not require extreme virtue or fortune, only “fortunate astuteness”.

Machiavelli makes an important distinction between two groups that are present in every city, and have very different appetites driving them: the "great" and the "people". The "great" wish to oppress and rule the "people", while the "people" wish ''not'' to be ruled or oppressed. A principality is not the only outcome possible from these appetites, because it can also lead to either "liberty" or "license".

A principality is put into place either by the "great" or the "people" when they have the opportunity to take power, but find resistance from the other side. They assign a leader who can be popular to the people while the great benefit, or a strong authority defending the people against the great. 

Machiavelli goes on to say that a prince who obtains power through the support of the nobles has a harder time staying in power than someone who is chosen by the common people; since the former finds himself surrounded by people who consider themselves his equals. He has to resort to malevolent measures to satisfy the nobles. &lt;blockquote&gt;One cannot by fair dealing, and without injury to others, satisfy the nobles, but you can satisfy the people, for their object is more righteous than that of the nobles, the latter wishing to oppress, while the former only desire not to be oppressed&lt;/blockquote&gt;Also a prince cannot afford to keep the common people hostile as they are larger in number while the nobles smaller. 

Therefore the great should be made and unmade every day. There are two types of great people that might be encountered:
# Those who are bound to the prince. Concerning these it is important to distinguish between two types of obligated great people, those who are rapacious and those who are not. It is the latter who can and should be honoured.
# Those who are not bound to the new prince. Once again these need to be divided into two types: those with a weak spirit (a prince can make use of them if they are of good counsel) and those who shun being bound because of their own ambition (these should be watched and feared as enemies).
	
How to win over people depends on circumstances. Machiavelli advises:
* Do not get frightened in adversity.
* One should avoid ruling via magistrates, if one wishes to be able to “ascend” to absolute rule quickly and safely.	
* One should make sure that the people need the prince, especially if a time of need should come.

===How to judge the strength of principalities (Chapter 10)===
The way to judge the strength of a princedom is to see whether it can defend itself, or whether it needs to depend on allies. This does not just mean that the cities should be prepared and the people trained; a prince who is hated is also exposed.

===Ecclesiastical principates (Chapter 11)===
[[Image:Cardinal Giovanni de' Medici.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leo X]]: a pope, but also a member of the [[House of Medici|Medici family]]. Machiavelli suggested they should treat the church as a princedom, as the [[House of Borgia|Borgia family]] had, in order to conquer Italy, and found new modes and orders.]]
This type of "princedom" refers for example explicitly to the Catholic church, which is of course not traditionally thought of as a princedom. According to Machiavelli, these are relatively easy to maintain, once founded. They do not need to defend themselves militarily, nor to govern their subjects.

Machiavelli discusses the recent history of the Church as if it were a princedom that was in competition to conquer Italy against other princes. He points to factionalism as a historical weak point in the Church, and points to the recent example of the [[House of Borgia|Borgia]] family as a better strategy which almost worked. He then explicitly proposes that the [[House of Medici|Medici]] are now in a position to try the same thing.

===Defense and military (Chapter 12–14)===
Having discussed the various types of [[principalities]], Machiavelli turns to the ways a state can attack other territories or defend itself. The two most essential foundations for any state, whether old or new, are sound laws and strong military forces.&lt;ref name=Ch12&gt;{{Citation|last=Machiavelli|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/machiavelli/niccolo/m149p/chapter12.html|chapter=Chapter 12|title=The Prince|publisher=Constitution.org |accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A self-sufficient prince is one who can meet any enemy on the battlefield. He should be "armed" with his own arms. However, a prince that relies solely on fortifications or on the help of others and stands on the defensive is not self-sufficient. If he cannot raise a formidable army, but must rely on defense, he must fortify his city. A well-fortified city is unlikely to be attacked, and if it is, most armies cannot endure an extended siege. However, during a siege a virtuous prince will keep the morale of his subjects high while removing all [[dissenters]]. Thus, as long as the city is properly defended and has enough supplies, a wise prince can withstand any siege.

Machiavelli stands strongly against the use of [[mercenary|mercenaries]], and in this he was innovative, and he also had personal experience in Florence. He believes they are useless to a ruler because they are undisciplined, cowardly, and without any loyalty, being motivated only by money. Machiavelli attributes the Italian city states’ weakness to their reliance on mercenary armies.

Machiavelli also warns against using auxiliary forces, troops borrowed from an ally, because if they win, the employer is under their favor and if they lose, he is ruined. Auxiliary forces are more dangerous than mercenary forces because they are united and controlled by capable leaders who may turn against the employer.

The main concern for a prince should be war, or the preparation thereof, not books. Through war a hereditary prince maintains his power or a private citizen rises to power. Machiavelli advises that a prince must frequently hunt in order to keep his body fit and learn the landscape surrounding his kingdom. Through this, he can best learn how to protect his territory and advance upon others. For intellectual strength, he is advised to study great military men so he may imitate their successes and avoid their mistakes. A prince who is diligent in times of peace will be ready in times of adversity. Machiavelli writes, “thus, when fortune turns against him he will be prepared to resist it.”

===The Qualities of a Prince (Chapters 14–19)===
Each of the following chapters presents a discussion about a particular virtue or vice that a prince might have, and is therefore structured in a way which appears like traditional advice for a prince. However, the advice is far from traditional.

====A Prince's Duty Concerning Military Matters (Chapter 14)====
Machiavelli believes that a prince's main focus should be on perfecting the art of war. He believes that by taking this profession a ruler will be able to protect his kingdom. He claims that "being disarmed makes you despised." He believes that the only way to ensure loyalty from one's soldiers is to understand military matters.
The two activities Machiavelli recommends practicing to prepare for war are physical and mental. Physically, he believes rulers should learn the landscape of their territories. Mentally, he encouraged the study of past military events. He also warns against idleness.

====Reputation of a prince (Chapter 15)====
Because, says Machiavelli, he wants to write something useful to those who understand, he thought it more fitting "to go directly to the effectual truth ("''verità effettuale''") of the thing than to the imagination of it". This section is one where Machiavelli’s pragmatic ideal can be seen most clearly. The prince should, ideally, be virtuous, but he should be willing and able to abandon those virtues if it becomes necessary. Concerning the behavior of a prince toward his subjects, Machiavelli announces that he will depart from what other writers say, and writes: {{quotation|Men have imagined republics and principalities that never really existed at all. Yet the way men live is so far removed from the way they ought to live that anyone who abandons what is for what should be pursues his downfall rather than his preservation; for a man who strives after goodness in all his acts is sure to come to ruin, since there are so many men who are not good.}}
Since there are many possible qualities that a prince can be said to possess, he must not be overly concerned about having all the good ones. Also, a prince may be perceived to be merciful, faithful, humane, frank, and religious, but most important is only to ''seem'' to have these qualities. A ''prince'' cannot truly have these qualities because at times it is ''necessary'' to act against them. In fact, he must sometimes deliberately choose evil. Although a bad reputation should be avoided, it is sometimes necessary to have one.

====Generosity vs. parsimony (Chapter 16)====
If a prince is overly generous to his subjects, Machiavelli asserts he will not be appreciated, and will only cause greed for more. Additionally, being overly generous is not economical, because eventually all resources will be exhausted. This results in higher taxes, and will bring grief upon the prince. Then, if he decides to discontinue or limit his generosity, he will be labeled as a miser. Thus, Machiavelli summarizes that guarding against the people’s hatred is more important than building up a reputation for generosity. A wise prince should be willing to be more reputed a miser than be hated for trying to be too generous.

On the other hand: "of what is not yours or your subjects' one can be a bigger giver, as were [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], and [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], because spending what is someone else's does not take reputation from you but adds it to you; only spending your own hurts you".

====Cruelty vs. Mercy (Chapter 17)====
[[File:Young Folks' History of Rome illus174.png|right|thumb|300px|[[Hannibal]] meeting [[Scipio Africanus]]. Machiavelli describes Hannibal as having the "[[virtue]]" of "inhuman cruelty". But he lost to someone, [[Scipio Africanus]], who showed the weakness of "excessive mercy" and who could therefore only have held power in a republic.]]
In addressing the question of whether it is better to be loved or feared, Machiavelli writes, “The answer is that one would like to be both the one and the other; but because it is difficult to combine them, it is far safer to be feared than loved if you cannot be both.” As Machiavelli asserts, commitments made in peace are not always kept in adversity; however, commitments made in fear are kept out of fear. Yet, a prince must ensure that he is not feared to the point of hatred, which is very possible.

This chapter is possibly the most well-known of the work, and it is important because of the reasoning behind Machiavelli’s famous idea that it is better to be feared than loved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Nicole |title=Feared Versus Loved: An Analysis of "The Prince" by Machiavelli |url=http://www.articlemyriad.com/197.htm |publisher=Article Myriad |accessdate=2011-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316183718/http://www.articlemyriad.com/197.htm |archivedate=16 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; – his justification is purely pragmatic; as he notes, “Men worry less about doing an injury to one who makes himself loved than to one who makes himself feared.” Fear is simply a means to an end, and that end is security for the prince. The fear instilled should never be excessive, for that could be dangerous to the prince. Above all, Machiavelli argues, a prince should not interfere with the property of their subjects, their women, or the life of somebody without proper justification.

Regarding the troops of the prince, fear is absolutely necessary to keep a large garrison united and a prince should not mind the thought of cruelty in that regard. For a prince who leads his own army, it is imperative for him to observe cruelty because that is the only way he can command his soldiers' absolute respect. Machiavelli compares two great military leaders: [[Hannibal]] and [[Scipio Africanus]]. Although Hannibal's army consisted of men of various races, they were never rebellious because they feared their leader. Machiavelli says this required "inhuman cruelty" which he refers to as a virtue. Scipio's men, on the other hand, were known for their mutiny and dissension, due to Scipio's "excessive mercy" – which was however a source of glory because he lived in a republic.

====In what way princes should keep their word (Chapter 18)====
Machiavelli notes that a prince is praised for keeping his word. However, he also notes that a prince is also praised for the illusion of being reliable in keeping his word. A prince, therefore, should only keep his word when it suits his purposes, but do his utmost to maintain the illusion that he does keep his word and that he is reliable in that regard. Therefore, a prince should not break his word unnecessarily.

As Machiavelli notes, “He should appear to be compassionate, faithful to his word, guileless, and devout. And indeed he should be so. But his disposition should be such that, if he needs to be the opposite, he knows how.” As noted in chapter 15, the prince must appear to be virtuous, and should be virtuous, but he should be able to be otherwise when the time calls for it; that includes being able to lie, though however much he lies he should always keep the appearance of being truthful.

====Avoiding contempt and hatred (Chapter 19)====
Machiavelli observes that most men are content as long as they are not deprived of their property and women. A prince should command respect through his conduct, because a prince that is highly respected by his people is unlikely to face internal struggles. Additionally, a prince who does not raise the contempt of the nobles and keeps the people satisfied, Machiavelli assures, should have no fear of conspirators. Machiavelli advises monarchs to have both internal and external fears. Internal fears exist inside his kingdom and focus on his subjects, Machiavelli warns to be suspicious of everyone when hostile attitudes emerge. External fears are of foreign powers.

===The Prudence of the Prince (Chapters 20–25)===

====Whether ruling conquests with fortresses works (Chapter 20)====
Machiavelli mentions that placing fortresses in conquered territories, although it sometimes works, often fails. Using fortresses can be a good plan, but Machiavelli says he shall "blame anyone who, trusting in fortresses, thinks little of being hated by the people". He cited [[Caterina Sforza]], who used a fortress to defend herself but was eventually betrayed by her people.

====Gaining honours (Chapter 21)====
A prince truly earns honour by completing great feats. [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand of Spain]] is cited by Machiavelli as an example of a monarch who gained esteem by showing his ability through great feats and who, in the name of religion, conquered many territories and kept his subjects occupied so that they had no chance to rebel.
Regarding two warring states, Machiavelli asserts it is always wiser to choose a side, rather than to be neutral. Machiavelli then provides the following reasons why:
* If your allies win, you benefit whether or not you have more power than they have.
* If you are more powerful, then your allies are under your command; if your allies are stronger, they will always feel a certain obligation to you for your help.
* If your side loses, you still have an ally in the loser.
Machiavelli also notes that it is wise for a prince not to ally with a stronger force unless compelled to do so. In conclusion, the most important virtue is having the wisdom to discern what ventures will come with the most reward and then pursuing them courageously.

====Nobles and staff (Chapter 22)====
The selection of good servants is reflected directly upon the prince’s intelligence, so if they are loyal, the prince is considered wise; however, when they are otherwise, the prince is open to adverse criticism. Machiavelli asserts that there are three types of intelligence:
* The kind that understands things for itself – which is excellent to have.
* The kind that understands what others can understand – which is good to have.
* The kind that does not understand for itself, nor through others – which is useless to have.

If the prince does not have the first type of intelligence, he should at the very least have the second type. For, as Machiavelli states, “A prince needs to have the discernment to recognize the good or bad in what another says or does even though he has no acumen himself".

====Avoiding flatterers (Chapter 23)====
This chapter displays a low opinion of flatterers; Machiavelli notes that “Men are so happily absorbed in their own affairs and indulge in such self-deception that it is difficult for them not to fall victim to this plague; and some efforts to protect oneself from flatterers involve the risk of becoming despised.”  Flatterers were seen as a great danger to a prince, because their flattery could cause him to avoid wise counsel in favor of rash action, but avoiding all advice, flattery or otherwise, was equally bad; a middle road had to be taken. A prudent prince should have a select group of wise counselors to advise him truthfully on matters all the time. All their opinions should be taken into account. Ultimately, the decision should be made by the prince and carried out absolutely. If a prince is given to changing his mind, his reputation will suffer. A prince must have the wisdom to recognize good advice from bad. Machiavelli gives a negative example in [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian I]]; Maximilian, who was secretive, never consulted others, but once he ordered his plans and met dissent, he immediately changed them.

===Prudence and chance===

====Why the princes of Italy lost their states (Chapter 24)====
After first mentioning that a new prince can quickly become as respected as a hereditary one, Machiavelli says princes in Italy who had longstanding power and lost it cannot blame bad luck, but should blame their own indolence. One "should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up". They all showed a defect of arms (already discussed) and either had a hostile populace or did not know to secure themselves with the great.

====Fortune (Chapter 25)====
As pointed out by {{Harvcoltxt|Gilbert|1938|page=206}} it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but "Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work". Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with "sweat", prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances.

Machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that "it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down."&lt;ref name=Ch25&gt;{{Citation|last=Machiavelli|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/machiavelli/niccolo/m149p/chapter25.html|chapter=Chapter 25|title=The Prince|publisher=Constitution.org |accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert (p.&amp;nbsp;217) points out that Machiavelli's friend the historian and diplomat [[Francesco Guicciardini]] expressed similar ideas about fortune.

Machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season. In periods of calm, however, people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact. Fortune, Machiavelli argues, seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered, as had recently been the case in Italy. As {{Harvcoltxt|de Alvarez|1999|pp=125–30}} points out that what Machiavelli actually says is that Italians in his time leave things not just to fortune, but to "fortune and God". Machiavelli is indicating in this passage, as in some others in his works, that Christianity itself was making Italians helpless and lazy concerning their own politics, as if they would leave dangerous rivers uncontrolled.&lt;ref&gt;As [[Francis Bacon]] wrote in his 13th essay, quoted at {{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1958|p=176}}, that "one of the doctors of Italy, Nicholas Machiavel, had the confidence to put in writing, almost in plain terms, ''That the Christian faith had given up good men in prey to those who are tyrannical and unjust''".&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exhortation to Seize Italy and to Free Her from the Barbarians (Chapter 26)====

Pope [[Leo X]] was pope at the time the book was written and a member of the de Medici family. This chapter directly appeals to the Medici to use what has been summarized in order to conquer Italy using Italian armies, following the advice in the book. {{Harvcoltxt|Gilbert|1938|pp=222–30}} showed that including such exhortation was not unusual in the genre of books full of advice for princes. But it is unusual that the Medici family's position of Papal power is openly named as something that should be used as a personal power base, as a tool of secular politics. Indeed, one example is the Borgia family's "recent" and controversial attempts to use church power in secular politics, often brutally executed. This continues a controversial theme throughout the book.

==Analysis==
[[File:Anon-Cesare-Borgia.jpg|right|thumb|[[Cesare Borgia]], Duke of Valentinois. According to Machiavelli, a risk taker and example of "criminal virtue." Failed in the end because of one mistake: he was naive to trust a new Pope.]]
As shown by his letter of dedication, Machiavelli's work eventually came to be dedicated to [[Lorenzo II de' Medici, Duke of Urbino|Lorenzo di Piero de' Medici]], grandson of "[[Lorenzo the Magnificent]]", and a member of the ruling Florentine Medici family, whose uncle Giovanni became Pope [[Leo X]] in 1513. It is known from his personal correspondence that it was written during 1513, the year after the Medici took control of Florence, and a few months after Machiavelli's arrest, torture, and banishment by the in-coming Medici regime. It was discussed for a long time with [[Francesco Vettori]] – a friend of Machiavelli – whom he wanted to pass it and commend it to the Medici. The book had originally been intended for [[Giuliano di Lorenzo de' Medici]], young Lorenzo's uncle, who however died in 1516.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Najemy|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not certain that the work was ever read by any of the Medici before it was printed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Dent|1995}} p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; Machiavelli describes the contents as being an un-embellished summary of his knowledge about the nature of princes and "the actions of great men", based not only on reading but also, unusually, on real experience.&lt;ref name=Let&gt;{{Citation|last=Machiavelli|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/machiavelli/niccolo/m149p/|chapter=Dedication|title=The Prince|publisher=Constitution.org |accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The types of political behavior which are discussed with apparent approval by Machiavelli in ''The Prince'' were regarded as shocking by contemporaries, and its immorality is still a subject of serious discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Fischer|2000|p=181}} says that some people "might hold Machiavelli to some extent responsible for the crimes of a [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], [[Mao Zedong|Mao]], or [[Pol Pot]], who had learned from him to excuse the murder of innocents by its supposed benefits for humanity." {{Harvtxt|Strauss|1958|p=12}} writes that "We shall not hesitate to assert, as very many have asserted before us, and we shall later on try to prove, that Machiavelli's teaching is immoral and irreligious."&lt;/ref&gt; Although the work advises princes how to tyrannize, Machiavelli is generally thought to have preferred some form of free republic.&lt;ref&gt;For example {{Harvtxt|Strauss|1958|p=182}}: "Machiavelli's book on principalities and his book on republics are both republican."&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators justify his acceptance of immoral and criminal actions by leaders by arguing that he lived during a time of continuous political conflict and instability in Italy, and that his influence has increased the "pleasures, equality and freedom" of many people, loosening the grip of medieval Catholicism's "classical [[teleology]]", which "disregarded not only the needs of individuals and the wants of the common man, but stifled innovation, enterprise, and enquiry into cause and effect relationships that now allow us to control [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Fischer|2000|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, {{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1958|p=11}} notes that "even if we were forced to grant that Machiavelli was essentially a patriot or a scientist, we would not be forced to deny that he was a teacher of evil".&lt;ref&gt;Concerning being a scientist, {{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1958|pp=54–55}} says that this description of Machiavelli as a scientist "is defensible and even helpful provided it is properly meant" because ''The Prince'' "conveys a general teaching" and only uses specific historical facts and experience as a basis for such generalizing. On the other hand {{Harvtxt|Strauss|1958|p=11}}: "Machiavelli's works abound with "value-judgments". Concerning patriotism {{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1958|pp=10–11}} writes that "Machiavelli understood it as collective selfishness." It is Machiavelli's indifferent "comprehensive reflection" about right and wrong, which is "the core of Machiavelli's thought," not love of the fatherland as such.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Machiavelli "was too thoughtful not to know what he was doing and too generous not to admit it to his reasonable friends".&lt;ref&gt;Much of Machiavelli's personal correspondence with other Florentines is preserved, including some of the most famous letters in Italian. Of particular interest for example, are some of his letters to [[Francesco Vettori]] and [[Francesco Guicciardini]], two men who had managed to stay in public service under the Medici, unlike Machiavelli. To Guicciardini for example he wrote concerning the selection of a preacher for Florence, that he would like a hypocritical one, and "I believe that the following would be the true way to go to Paradise: learn the way to Hell in order to steer clear of it." (Letter 270 in {{Harvcoltxt|Machiavelli|1996}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Machiavelli emphasized the need for [[realism in international relations theory|realism]], as opposed to [[idealism]]. Along with this, he stresses the difference between human-beings and animals since "there are two ways of contending, one in accordance with the laws, the other by force; the first of which is proper to men, the second to beast".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://umich.instructure.com/courses/98476/files/folder/Readings?preview=2248113|title=U-M Weblogin|website=umich.instructure.com|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''The Prince'' he does not explain what he thinks the best ethical or political goals are, except the control of one's own fortune, as opposed to waiting to see what chance brings. Machiavelli took it for granted that would-be leaders naturally aim at glory or [[honour]]. He associated these goals with a need for "[[virtue]]" and "[[prudence]]" in a leader, and saw such virtues as essential to good politics and indeed the common good. That great men should develop and use their virtue and prudence was a traditional theme of advice to Christian princes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gilbert|1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; And that more virtue meant less reliance on chance was a classically influenced "[[humanism|humanist]] commonplace" in Machiavelli's time, as {{Harvcoltxt|Fischer|2000|p=75}} says, even if it was somewhat controversial. However, Machiavelli went far beyond other authors in his time, who in his opinion left things to fortune, and therefore to bad rulers, because of their Christian beliefs. He used the words "virtue" and "prudence" to refer to glory-seeking and spirited excellence of character, in strong contrast to the traditional Christian uses of those terms, but more keeping with the original pre-Christian Greek and Roman concepts from which they derived.&lt;ref&gt;While pride is a sin in the Bible, "[[Fortune favours the bold]]", used for example by {{Harvcoltxt|Dent|1995}} p. xxii to summarize Machiavelli's stance concerning fortune, was a classical saying. That the desire for glory of spirited young men can and should be allowed or even encouraged, because it is how the best rulers come to be, is a theory expressed most famously by Plato in his ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. (See {{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1958|p=289}}.) But as Strauss points out, Plato asserts that there is a higher type of life, and Machiavelli does not seem to accept this.&lt;/ref&gt; He encouraged ambition and risk taking. So in another break with tradition, he treated not only stability, but also radical [[innovation]], as possible aims of a prince in a political community. Managing major reforms can show off a Prince's virtue and give him glory. He clearly felt Italy needed major reform in his time, and this opinion of his time is widely shared.&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{Harvcoltxt|Guarini|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Machiavelli's descriptions encourage leaders to attempt to control their fortune gloriously, to the extreme extent that some situations may call for a fresh "founding" (or re-founding) of the "modes and orders" that define a community, despite the danger and necessary evil and lawlessness of such a project. Founding a wholly new state, or even a new religion, using injustice and immorality has even been called the chief theme of ''The Prince''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1987|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machiavelli justifies this position by explaining how if "a prince did not win love he may escape hate" by personifying injustice and immorality; therefore, he will never loosen his grip since "fear is held by the apprehension of punishment" and never diminishes as time goes by. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://umich.instructure.com/courses/98476/files/folder/Readings?preview=2248113|title=U-M Weblogin|website=umich.instructure.com|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a political theorist to do this in public was one of Machiavelli's clearest breaks not just with medieval scholasticism, but with the classical tradition of [[political philosophy]], especially the favorite philosopher of Catholicism at the time, [[Aristotle]]. This is one of Machiavelli's most lasting influences upon [[modernity]].

Nevertheless, Machiavelli was heavily influenced by classical pre-Christian [[political philosophy]]. According to {{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1958|p=291}} Machiavelli refers to [[Xenophon]] more than Plato, Aristotle, and [[Cicero]] put together. Xenophon wrote one of the classic mirrors of princes, the ''[[Education of Cyrus]]''. {{Harvcoltxt|Gilbert|1938|p=236}} wrote: "The Cyrus of Xenophon was a hero to many a literary man of the sixteenth century, but for Machiavelli he lived". Xenophon also, as Strauss pointed out, wrote a dialogue, ''[[Hiero (Xenophon)|Hiero]]'' which showed a wise man dealing sympathetically with a tyrant, coming close to what Machiavelli would do in questioning the ideal of "the imagined prince". Xenophon however, like Plato and Aristotle, was a follower of [[Socrates]], and his works show approval of a "[[teleological argument]]", while Machiavelli rejected such arguments. On this matter, {{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1958|pp=222–23}} gives evidence that Machiavelli may have seen himself as having learned something from [[Democritus]], [[Epicurus]] and [[atomism|classical materialism]], which was however not associated with political realism, or even any interest in politics.

On the topic of [[rhetoric]] Machiavelli, in his introduction, stated that “I have not embellished or crammed this book with rounded periods or big, impressive words, or with any blandishment or superfluous decoration of the kind which many are in the habit of using to describe or adorn what they have produced”. This has been interpreted as showing a distancing from traditional rhetoric styles, but there are echoes of classical rhetoric in several areas.  In Chapter 18, for example, he uses a metaphor of a lion and a fox, examples of cunning and force; according to {{Harvcoltxt|Zerba|2004|p=217}}, “the Roman author from whom Machiavelli in all likelihood drew the simile of the lion and the fox” was Cicero. The ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'', a work which was believed during Machiavelli’s time to have been written by Cicero, was used widely to teach rhetoric, and it is likely that Machiavelli was familiar with it. Unlike Cicero's more widely accepted works however, according to {{Harvcoltxt|Cox|1997|p=1122}}, “Ad Herennium ... offers a model of an ethical system that not only condones the practice of force and deception but appears to regard them as habitual and indeed germane to political activity”. This makes it an ideal text for Machiavelli to have used.

==Influence==
To quote {{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|p=14}}:
{{quotation|...there were in circulation approximately fifteen editions of the ''Prince'' and nineteen of the ''Discourses'' and French translations of each before they were placed on [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|the Index]] of [[Paul IV]] in 1559, a measure which nearly stopped publication in Catholic areas except in France. Three principal writers took the field against Machiavelli between the publication of his works and their condemnation in 1559 and again by the Tridentine Index in 1564. These were the English cardinal [[Reginald Pole]] and the Portuguese bishop [[Jerónimo Osório]], both of whom lived for many years in Italy, and the Italian humanist and later bishop, [[Ambrogio Caterino Politi]].}}

[[File:Henry-VIII-kingofengland 1491-1547.jpg|thumb|right|Henry VIII of England. A king who eventually split with the Catholic church, and supported some [[protestant]] ideas in the first generation to read ''The Prince''.]]
Machiavelli's ideas on how to accrue honour and power as a leader had a profound impact on political leaders throughout the modern west, helped by the new technology of the printing press. Pole reported that it was spoken of highly by his enemy [[Thomas Cromwell]] in England, and had influenced [[Henry VIII]] in his turn towards [[Protestantism]], and in his tactics, for example during the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]].&lt;ref name=BireleyP15&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy was also possessed by the Catholic king and emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Haitsma Mulier|1999|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, after an initially mixed reaction, Machiavelli came to be associated with [[Catherine de Medici]] and the [[St Bartholomew's Day Massacre]]. As {{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|p=17}} reports, in the 16th century, Catholic writers "associated Machiavelli with the Protestants, whereas Protestant authors saw him as Italian and Catholic". In fact, he was apparently influencing both Catholic and Protestant kings.&lt;ref&gt;While Bireley focuses on writers in the Catholic countries, {{Harvcoltxt|Haitsma Mulier|1999}} makes the same observation, writing with more of a focus upon the Protestant [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]].&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important early works dedicated to criticism of Machiavelli, especially ''The Prince'', was that of the [[Huguenot]], [[Innocent Gentillet]], ''Discourse against Machiavelli'', commonly also referred to as ''Anti Machiavel'', published in [[Geneva]] in 1576. He accused Machiavelli of being an atheist and accused politicians of his time by saying that they treated his works as the "[[Koran]] of the courtiers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theme of Gentillet was more in the spirit of Machiavelli himself: he questioned the effectiveness of immoral strategies (just as Machiavelli had himself done, despite also explaining how they could sometimes work). This became the theme of much future political discourse in Europe during the 17th century. This includes the Catholic [[Counter Reformation]] writers summarised by Bireley: [[Giovanni Botero]], [[Justus Lipsius]], [[Carlo Scribani]], [[Adam Contzen]], [[Pedro de Ribadeneira]], and [[Diego Saavedra Fajardo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors criticized Machiavelli, but also followed him in many ways. They accepted the need for a prince to be concerned with reputation, and even a need for cunning and deceit, but compared to Machiavelli, and like later modernist writers, they emphasized [[economic growth|economic progress]] much more than the riskier ventures of war. These authors tended to cite [[Tacitus]] as their source for realist political advice, rather than Machiavelli, and this pretense came to be known as "[[Tacitean studies|Tacitism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|pp=223–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[materialism|materialist]] philosophy developed in the 16th, 17th and 18th century, starting in the generations after Machiavelli. The importance of Machiavelli's realism was noted by many important figures in this endeavor, for example [[Jean Bodin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|p=17}}: "Jean Bodin's first comments, found in his ''Method for the Easy Comprehension of History'', published in 1566, were positive."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Bacon]],&lt;ref&gt;Bacon wrote: "We are much beholden to Machiavelli and other writers of that class who openly and unfeignedly declare or describe what men do, and not what they ought to do." {{Citation|title=Of the Advancement of Learning|chapter=II.21.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Harrington (author)|Harrington]], [[John Milton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Worden|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spinoza's Political Philosophy|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-political/#IntBac|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=2011-03-19|publisher= Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|year= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[David Hume|Hume]],&lt;ref&gt;Danford "Getting Our Bearings: Machiavelli and Hume" in {{Harvtxt|Rahe|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Gibbon]], and [[Adam Smith]]. Although he was not always mentioned by name as an inspiration, due to his controversy, he is also thought to have been an influence for other major philosophers, such as [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Schaefer|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[René Descartes|Descartes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kennington|2004}}, chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[John Locke|Locke]]&lt;ref&gt;Barnes Smith "The Philosophy of Liberty: Locke's Machiavellian Teaching" in {{Harvtxt|Rahe|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Montesquieu]].&lt;ref&gt;Carrese "The Machiavellian Spirit of Montesquieu's Liberal Republic" in {{Harvtxt|Rahe|2006}}. Shklar "Montesquieu and the new republicanism" in {{Harvtxt|Bock|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In literature:
* Machiavelli is featured as a character in the [[prologue]] of [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[The Jew of Malta]]''.
* In [[William Shakespeare's]] tragedy, ''[[Othello]]'', the antagonist [[Iago]] has been noted by some literary critics as being archetypal in adhering to Machiavelli's ideals by advancing himself through machination and duplicity with the consequence of causing the demise of both [[Othello (character)|Othello]] and [[Desdemona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stjohns-chs.org/english/Renaissance/mach.html | title=Machiavelli and Renaissance Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst later political leaders:
* The republicanism in seventeenth century England which led to the [[English civil war]], [[Glorious Revolution]] and subsequent development of the [[English Constitution]] was strongly influenced by Machiavelli's political thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Worden|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Most of the [[founding fathers]] of the [[American Revolution]] are known or often proposed to have been strongly influenced by Machiavelli's political works, including [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[James Madison]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[John Adams]].&lt;ref name=thompson&gt;{{Harvtxt|Thompson|1995}}{{Dead link|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Rahe|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walling "Was Alexander Hamilton a Machiavellian Statesman?" in {{Harvtxt|Rahe|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harper|2004}}{{Dead link|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Under the guidance of [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick the Great]] of [[Prussia]] criticised Machiavelli's conclusions in his "[[Anti-Machiavel]]", published in 1740.
* At different stages in his life, [[Napoleon I of France]] wrote extensive comments to ''The Prince''. After his defeat at [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]], these comments were found in the emperor's coach and taken by the Prussian military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Machiavelli|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Italians|Italian]] dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] wrote a discourse on ''The Prince''.&lt;ref&gt;Mussolini, "Preludio al ''Principe''", ''[[Gerarchia]]'' 3 (1924).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Joseph Stalin]] read ''The Prince'' and annotated his own copy.&lt;ref&gt;Stalin: A Biography By Robert Service&lt;/ref&gt;

20th century Italian-American [[mobster]]s were influenced by ''The Prince''. [[John Gotti]] and [[Roy DeMeo]] would regularly quote ''The Prince'' and consider it to be the
"[[American mafia|Mafia]] Bible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/gotti/up_4.html |title=John Gotti – The Last Mafia Icon – Moving Up – Crime Library on |work=Trutv.com |accessdate=2012-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231090947/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/gotti/up_4.html |archivedate=2011-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/weird/roy_demeo/6.html |title=Roy DeMeo – Another Perspective – Crime Library on |work=Trutv.com |accessdate=2012-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121111332/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/weird/roy_demeo/6.html |archivedate=2012-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation of ''The Prince'' as political satire or as deceit==
As discussed by {{Harvtxt|Johnston|1958}} many authors have historically argued that "the book is, first and foremost, a satire, so that many of the things we find in it which are morally absurd, specious, and contradictory, are there quite deliberately in order to ridicule ... the very notion of tyrannical rule". Hence, Johnston says, "the satire has a firm moral purpose – to expose tyranny and promote republican government."&lt;ref&gt;See also {{Harvtxt|Mattingly|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This position was the standard one in Europe during the 18th century, amongst the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ''[[philosophes]]''. [[Diderot]] thought it was a satire. And in his [[Social Contract (Rousseau)|''The Social Contract'']], the French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] said: {{quotation|Machiavelli was a proper man and a good citizen; but, being attached to the court of the Medici, he could not help veiling his love of liberty in the midst of his country's oppression. The choice of his detestable hero, [[Caesar Borgia]], clearly enough shows his hidden aim; and the contradiction between the teaching of the ''Prince'' and that of the ''Discourses on Livy'' and the ''History of Florence'' shows that this profound political thinker has so far been studied only by superficial or corrupt readers. The Court of Rome sternly prohibited his book. I can well believe it; for it is that Court it most clearly portrays.|[http://www.constitution.org/jjr/socon_03.htm#23 ''Social Contract'', Book 3, note to Chapter 6].}}

Whether or not the word "satire" is the best choice, there is more general agreement that despite seeming to be written for someone wanting to be a monarch, and not the leader of a republic, ''The Prince'' can be read as deliberately emphasizing the benefits of free republics as opposed to monarchies.

Differences of opinion amongst commentators revolve around whether this sub-text was intended to be understood, let alone understood as deliberately satirical or comic.

One such commentator, Mary Dietz, writes that Machiavelli's agenda was not to be satirical, as Rousseau had argued, but instead was "offering carefully crafted advice (such as arming the people) designed to undo the ruler if taken seriously and followed."&lt;ref&gt;Deitz, M., 1986, “Trapping the Prince: Machiavelli and the Politics of Deception,” American Political Science Review, 80: 777–99.&lt;/ref&gt; By this account, the aim was to reestablish the republic in Florence. She focuses on three categories in which Machiavelli gives paradoxical advice:
* He discourages liberality and favors deceit to guarantee support from the people. Yet Machiavelli is keenly aware of the fact that an earlier pro-republican coup had been thwarted by the people's inaction that itself stemmed from the prince's liberality.
* He supports arming the people despite the fact that he knows the Florentines are decidedly pro-democratic and would oppose the prince.
* He encourages the prince to live in the city he conquers. This opposes the Medici's habitual policy of living outside the city. It also makes it easier for rebels or a civilian militia to attack and overthrow the prince.

According to Dietz the trap never succeeded because Lorenzo – "a suspicious prince" – apparently never read the work of the "former republican."&lt;ref&gt;Deitz, M., 1986, "[http://digilib.bc.edu/reserves/po041/kell/po04107.pdf Trapping the Prince: Machiavelli and the Politics of Deception]," American Political Science Review, 80: 796.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian Marxist philosopher [[Antonio Gramsci]] argued that Machiavelli's audience for this work was not the classes who already rule (or have "hegemony") over the common people, but the common people themselves, trying to establish a new hegemony, and making Machiavelli the first "Italian [[Jacobin]]".&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{citation|title=Antonio Gramsci and the Origins of Italian Communism|author=John McKay Cammett|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTCsAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA210.|isbn=9780804701419|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hans Baron is one of the few major commentators who argues that Machiavelli must have changed his mind dramatically in favour of free republics, after having written ''The Prince''.{{sfn|Baron|1961}}

'''''The Vision of Saint Eustace''''' is a painting by the early [[Italian Renaissance painting|Italian Renaissance]] master [[Pisanello]], now in the [[National Gallery]] in London. The date of the work is unknown and has been assigned by various scholars to different points in Pisanello’s career,&lt;ref&gt;Dunkerton, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; but the National Gallery's website currently dates it to "about 1438–42".&lt;ref&gt;see External links; accessed January 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The work depicts [[Saint Eustace]] before a stag, between the antlers of which is a crucifix, as described in the ''[[Golden Legend]]''. Although a similar story is told of [[Saint Hubert]], the identification of the figure as Saint Eustace is based on the fact that Pisanello painted Saint Eustace in [[Sant'Anastasia (Verona)|Sant'Anastasia]]. Saint Hubert’s depiction in Italian art during this period is also unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Eustace is portrayed as a huntsman dressed in the height of court fashion, wearing a golden tunic and blue headdress. The patron was therefore given the opportunity to appreciate the work as a devotional piece in addition to identifying with the aristocratic pastime of hunting and chivalric ideology. The patron for whom the work was painted is, however, unknown. Suggested patrons include the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] and [[Filippo Maria Visconti]]. [[Leonello d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara|Leonello]] or  [[Borso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara|Borso d’Este]], keen huntsmen, have also been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the saint could be a profile portrait of the patron.&lt;ref&gt;Dunkerton, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

The hunting scene allowed Pisanello to demonstrate his considerable skill in depicting animals and birds in a naturalistic but decorative way. Drawings of them from pattern books were undoubtedly used.&lt;ref&gt;Dunkerton, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; The animals are portrayed at various scales and scattered around a ‘tipped-up’ landscape not dissimilar to those visible in Netherlandish [[Tapestry|tapestries]]. The landscape's construction also demonstrates a familiarity with illuminations in manuscript hunting treatises, such as the canonical ''Livre de Chasse'' by [[Gaston Phoebus]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the blank scroll in the foreground of the painting is unknown. There is no evidence to suggest it ever contained any lettering. Its original intention may have been to carry the words of Christ to Saint Eustace or to bear a motto provided by the patron. It has been suggested, however, that the empty scroll is designed to demonstrate the superfluity of words in relation to images and thus refers to a contemporary humanist debate regarding the relative merits of poetry and art.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

During the course of its history, ''The Vision of Saint Eustace'' has been extensively repainted and retouched. Originally, the panel was taller (it has been cut at the top).&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; The landscape has darkened because of the black underpaint and the use of malachite. The gold leaf in the tunic and harness has been regilded. Some animals, like the bear, have been entirely repainted. The saint’s hat and face, however, are well preserved and the ''[[pastiglia]]'' (low [[gesso]] [[relief]] for decoration of some details), present in the harness, hunting horn and spurs, is original.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was bought by the National Gallery in 1895, catalogued as NG 1436, and is today on display in room 55.&lt;ref&gt;National Gallery webpage, see external links, accessed January 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts''' (TIPA) was founded by [[Tenzin Gyatso]], [[the 14th Dalai Lama]] on reaching [[McLeod Ganj]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[India]] in exile from [[Tibet]] in August 1959. It was then called  Tibetan Music, Dance and Drama Society, which was one of the first institutes set up by the Dalai Lama,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qMqBvtL_nI0C&amp;pg=PA513&amp;dq=Norbulingka+Institute&amp;as_brr=0#PPA514,M1 Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts] ''Frommer's India'', by Pippa De Bruyn, Keith Bain, Niloufer Venkatraman, Shonar Joshi. Published by Frommer's, 2008. {{ISBN|0-470-16908-7}}. ''Page 514''.&lt;/ref&gt; and was established to preserve Tibetan artistic heritage, especially opera, dance, and music.

==Opera company==
The new opera company employed both professional and amateur performers and entertained the Tibetan refugee camps and staged numerous performances of the folk [[Lhamo]] operas. These performances lasted all day and were "a reminder of home" for refugees.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Synopsis==
The series follows Whitney Cummings, as she portrays a fictionalized version of herself, and her very supportive live-in boyfriend, Alex. Even though the two have decided that they will not commit to marriage, she does question how committed they are in their 3-year relationship and tries to go as far to prove a point. She begins to fear what she sees as "relationship boredom" and worries what will happen next that could possibly end their relationship. Because of what she sees and hears around her involving other relationships, she uses unconventional methods to keep the romantic flames glowing with Alex, often seeking the help of her close friends. The sitcom is set in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbc.com/whitney/video/a-decent-proposal/1362082 |publisher=[[NBC]] |title=Whitney - A Decent Proposal - Video |date=October 13, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018162209/http://www.nbc.com/whitney/video/a-decent-proposal/1362082/ |archivedate=October 18, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and production==
''Whitney'' was one of two network television shows created by Whitney Cummings to premiere during the [[2011–12 United States network television schedule|2011-12 United States television season]]. The other, which she shares creator credit with [[Michael Patrick King]] and does not star in, is the [[CBS]] series ''[[2 Broke Girls]]'' which is produced by [[Warner Bros. Television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2011/05/13/person-of-interest-two-broke-girls-first-to-series-at-cbs-sarah-michelle-gellar-led-ringer-shifts-to-the-cw-342011/9271/ |title="Person of Interest," "Two Broke Girls" First to Series at CBS; Sarah Michelle Gellar-Led "Ringer" Shifts to The CW |publisher=The Futon Critic |date=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''Whitney'', Cummings serves as the executive producer, creator and writer with [[Scott Stuber]], Quan Phung, and [[Betsy Thomas]] for [[Universal Television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/05/11/nbc-picks-up-smash-prime-suspects-plus-two-more-sitcoms-to-series/92312 |title=Updated: NBC Picks Up "Smash", "Prime Suspects" and Two More Sitcoms to Series |publisher=TV By the Numbers |date=May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beverly D'Angelo]] originally played Patti, Whitney's mother, in the pilot episode before being replaced by [[Jane Kaczmarek]], with parts of the pilot being reshot as a consequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=N. |last=Andreeva |url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/08/jane-kaczmarek-joins-new-nbc-comedy-series-whitney/ |title=Jane Kaczmarek Joins New NBC Comedy Series 'Whitney' |publisher=Deadline.com |date=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tabloid, ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that Cummings received $60,000 per episode for the first three episodes, and was to receive a salary increase after the show ordered for a full season because of good ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/cummings_going_good_cXGKTNaePwVb3gk9lM8GDI |title=Cummings into her own |publisher=NYPOST.com |date=October 9, 2011 |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NBC moved the series to Wednesday beginning January 11, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/11/14/nbc-mid-season-schedule-harrys-law-to-sunday-grimm-stays-put-up-all-night-moves-later-whitney-to-wednesday-chuck-done-in-january-more/110647/ |title=NBC Mid-Season Schedule: ‘Harry’s Law’ To Sunday, ‘Grimm’ Stays Put, ‘Up All Night’ Moves Later, ‘Whitney’ To Wednesday, ‘Chuck’ Series Finale Set &amp; More |publisher=Tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com |date=November 14, 2011 |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 11, 2012, NBC renewed the series for a second season, which was to premiere on October 19, 2012. On October 8, 2012, the premiere date for ''Whitney'' was delayed by NBC to give it proper marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/352423/community-and-whitney-premiere-dates-delayed|title=Community and Whitney Premiere Dates Delayed|publisher=E! Online|accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 18, 2012, NBC announced it would air the season 2 premiere of ''Whitney'' on November 14, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/animal-practice-canceled-378328|title=NBC Cancels 'Animal Practice,' Adds 'Whitney' to Schedule|last=O'Connell|first=Michael|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=October 18, 2012|accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the poor critical reception of the show upon its debut that was largely directed at Cummings herself, the producers of ''Whitney'' changed the direction of the series to a more ensemble-like show in the style of ''[[Friends]]'' to reduce the pressure on Cummings, who was also experiencing personal troubles. At the time, her mother had suffered a stroke, and her sister was entering rehab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1331611200 |title=Whitney drops stockings - The Howard Stern Show |publisher=Howardstern.com |date=March 13, 2012 |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wil Calhoun]] replaced Betsy Thomas as showrunner for the second season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|title=Wil Calhoun Joins NBC’s ‘Whitney’ As New Showrunner|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/05/wil-calhoun-joins-nbcs-whitney-as-new-showrunner/|work=Deadline|accessdate=August 23, 2012|date=May 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Maulik Pancholy did not return to the show for the new season as the show focused more on the relationship between the two leads and less on the ensemble cast as seen in the later part of the previous season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Whitney-Maulik-Pancholy-Not-Returning-1052244.aspx?rss=breakingnews |title=Maulik Pancholy Not Returning to NBC's Whitney - Today's News: Our Take |publisher=TVGuide.com |date=August 22, 2012 |accessdate=September 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also announced that NBC Stand Up For Diversity winner Tone Bell would join the cast as a character named "RJ".&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter1"/&gt;

On November 9, 2012, NBC ordered five additional scripts for the television series, but only picked up three, increasing its season order to sixteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/11/nbcs-whitney-gets-order-for-5-scripts/ |title=NBC’s ‘Whitney’ Gets Order For 5 Scripts |work=Deadline.com |first=Nellie |last=Andreeva |date=November 8, 2012 |accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International broadcasts==
The series had been picked up in Canada by [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], where it premiered on September 19, 2011, after the season premiere of ''[[Two and a Half Men]]''. It continued air on the same night as the NBC telecasts, but was also scheduled in different timeslots by region.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
''Whitney'' originally premiered to mixed reviews from critics, with Cummings herself receiving criticism in online articles and reviews for the series. The first season holds a [[Metacritic]] score of 49/100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/whitney |title=Whitney - Season 1 Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More |publisher=Metacritic |date= |accessdate=September 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newyorker&gt;{{cite web|last=Nussbaum |first=Emily |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/television/2011/11/28/111128crte_television_nussbaum |title=NBC’s 'Whitney' and CBS's '2 Broke Girls' |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date= |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=frisky&gt;{{cite web|first=Jessica |last=Wakeman |url=http://www.thefrisky.com/2011-10-28/in-defense-of-whitney/ |title=In Defense Of 'Whitney' |publisher=The Frisky |date=October 28, 2011 |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New Yorker]]'''s Emily Nussbaum suggested that Cummings was 2011's "sexy-girl hate magnet", experiencing a disproportionate amount of attention for being successful as well as attractive.&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; An example of this saw Andrew Goldman of ''The New York Times'' asking Cummings in an interview if she had slept her way to success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jessica |last=Wakeman |url=http://www.thefrisky.com/2011-09-19/new-york-times-reporter-asks-whitney-cummings-about-sleeping-her-way-to/#more-1460151 |title=NY Times Reporter Asks Whitney Cummings About Sleeping Her Way To The Top |publisher=The Frisky |date=September 19, 2011 |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much criticism was also aimed at what was perceived as an overly aggressive ad campaign for the show by the network. The critics also found issue with the content of the ads, which were described as "regressive" and "old-fashioned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frucci |first=Adam |url=http://splitsider.com/2011/09/can-whitney-survive-its-ad-campaign-a-discussion/ |title=Can 'Whitney' Survive Its Ad Campaign?

As the series progressed, some reviewers remarked about improvements in the show. Willa Paskin of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' found that the series improved structurally from the eighth episode, while the chemistry of the two leads was brought to the forefront. However, she still found that the jokes were not good enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paskin |first=Willa |url=http://www.salon.com/2012/03/21/whitneys_second_coming/ |title="Whitney's" second coming - TV |publisher=Salon.com |date= |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaime Weinman of ''[[Maclean's]]'' agreed with Paskin, additionally noting that the series depicted a more realistic relationship compared with other freshmen sitcoms such as ''[[New Girl (TV series)|New Girl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weinman |first=Jaime |url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/03/23/the-nbc-sitcom-counter-backlash/ |title=The NBC sitcom counter-backlash|work=[[Maclean's]] |date=March 23, 2012 |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephan Lee, writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', compared ''Whitney'' favorably to Cummings' other series, ''[[2 Broke Girls]]'', citing what he perceived to be an increasingly stronger and more multidimensional supporting cast in the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Valby |first=Karen |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/10/28/whitney-2-broke-girls-contrarian-corner/ |title='Whitney' is better than '2 Broke Girls'|work=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|date=October 28, 2011 |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesse Fox of Splitsider found that the series began to find its footing as it progressed from its pilot and misleading initial ad campaign.&lt;ref name=splitsider&gt;{{cite web|last=David |first=Jesse |url=http://splitsider.com/2012/02/why-whitney-is-the-best-new-network-sitcom-of-2011-2012/ |title=Why Whitney is the Best New Network Sitcom of 2011-2012 |publisher=Splitsider |date=February 28, 2012 |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ratings===
The series debuted on Canada's CTV on September 19, 2011, three days before its U.S. premiere on NBC. The show won its timeslot with two million viewers, buoyed by its lead-in, the much-anticipated [[Nice to Meet You, Walden Schmidt|ninth-season premiere]] of ''[[Two and a Half Men]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/09/20/ash-tronomical-return-two-and-a-half-men-draws-largest-audience-ever-in-canada-too-with-5-million-viewers/104380/ |title=Ash-tronomical Return: 'Two and a Half Men' Draws Largest Audience Ever in Canada Too with 5 Million Viewers |publisher=Zap2it |date=September 20, 2011 |first=Robert |last=Seidman |accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series made a modest debut in the US, scoring with 6.8 million viewers and a 4.0/6 rating. However, it premiered more importantly to a strong 3.2 18–49 demo rating (on which the cost of advertisement is often dependent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2011/09/tv-ratings-x-factor-holds-charlies-angels-off-to-modest-start.html |title=TV Ratings: 'X Factor' holds, 'Charlie's Angels' off to modest start |publisher=Zap2it |date=September 23, 2011 |first=Mikey |last=O'Connell |accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December it had dropped to 4 million viewers and a 1.9 rating, being described by ''Entertainment Weekly'' as in "a ratings murk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/12/02/chelsea-handler-whitney-ratings/ |title=Chelsea Handler can't boost 'Whitney' ratings |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |date=December 2, 2011 |first=James |last=Hibberd |accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WikiToLearn''' is a collaborative, international, free knowledge project, run entirely by volunteers, and dedicated to the creation of [[Open textbooks|free]] and accessible textbooks for higher education. In December 2013 it joined the [[KDE]] Project through its incubation process with multiple sponsors like [[Wikimedia Italia]].

== History ==
WikiToLearn started as WikiFM in [[Milan]] by a group of science students from the [[University of Milan Bicocca]] on the May 1, 2012. WikiFM was originally launched as a private wiki for exchange of links, suggestions and other information related to studying at the University of Milan Bicocca.

In May 2013 the website has been publicly announced using some money destined to student associations of the University of Milan Bicocca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wikifm.org/2013/05/wikifm-cambia-faccia/ |title=WikiFM cambia faccia! &amp;#124; WikiFM blog |publisher=Blog.wikifm.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-12}} {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this historical reason, while the project has an international aim, the bulk of the oldest content is in Italian.

In September 2013 WikiFM received the sponsorship of [[Wikimedia Italia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wikifm.org/2013/10/wikifm-patrocinio-wikimedia-italia/ |title=WikiFM patrocinato da Wikimedia Italia! &amp;#124; WikiFM blog |publisher=Blog.wikifm.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-12}} {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, WikiFM officially joined the [[KDE]] project, by entering, as first project, [[KDE]]'s incubator program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/kde-community/2013q4/000375.html|title=[kde-community] Incubating project|work=kde.org|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://community.kde.org/Incubator/Projects/WikiFM&lt;/ref&gt; It was later advertised by the [[KDE]] project as one of its most important success stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dot.kde.org/2015/08/17/another-kde-success-story-incubator-part-1|title=Another KDE success story - the Incubator - Part 1|work=KDE.news|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== From WikiFM to WikiToLearn  ==
2015 has been the turning point for the project. The key event happened during [[KDE]]’s annual conference, Akademy. In July 2015, Riccardo Iaconelli has given a speech on the WikiFM project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://conf.kde.org/en/akademy2015/public/events/272|title=akademy2015: Akademy 2015 Program|work=kde.org|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to submit it to the attention of the international community. On this occasion, the website has enriched to accommodate multiple languages, to embrace a larger number of people using their native language.
Following the initial feedback, WikiFM was subsequently renamed to WikiToLearn. The project thus started to gather a more official attention from educational institutions. The first foundation interested in using WikiToLearn as a training/tutoring platform has been the High Energy Physics Software Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hepsoftwarefoundation.org|title=The HEP Software Foundation|work=hepsoftwarefoundation.org|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which experimentally tried its own section on the English website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikitolearn.org/Hep_Software_Foundation|title=Hep Software Foundation|work=wikitolearn.org|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikitolearn.org/Hep_Software_Foundation/Philosophy_of_this_site|title=Hep Software Foundation/Philosophy of this site - WikiToLearn - collaborative textbooks|work=wikitolearn.org|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several professors from different institutions have subsequently started to collaborate on WikiToLearn, like [[CERN]], HSF,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.hepsoftwarefoundation.org/workinggroups/2015/11/04/training.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fermilab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikitolearn.org/Contributing_to_WikiToLearn/Uni_list|title=Contributing to WikiToLearn/Uni list - WikiToLearn - collaborative textbooks|work=wikitolearn.org|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In September 2015, the University of Milano-Bicocca became the first institution to officially back  the project, asking professors and students to populate the portal with educational content.

== The project ==
The goal of WikiToLearn is to provide free, collaborative and accessible textbooks for the whole world, with a focus on training and didactics. To reach this goal, the project relies on the combined effort of many volunteers in the academic world.

Content are written by both students, who ideally start to create textbooks while studying the subject in question, and professors, who provide thorough fact-checking and accuracy.

Given the deep technical nature of the topics, there is a complex review and rating system under review  to try to measure the quality of the individual articles.&lt;ref&gt;https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/wikitolearn/attachments/20150831/67d000be/attachment.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Woodblock printing in Japan''' ({{lang|ja|木版画}}, '''''mokuhanga''''') is a technique best known for its use in the ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' artistic genre of single sheets, but it was also used for printing books in the same period. [[Woodblock printing]] had been used in China for centuries to print books, long before the advent of [[movable type]], but was widely adopted in Japan during the [[Edo period]] (1603–1868). Although similar to [[woodcut]] in Western [[printmaking]] in some regards, the mokuhanga technique differs in that it uses water-based inks—as opposed to western woodcut, which often uses oil-based inks. The Japanese water-based inks provide a wide range of vivid colors, [[glaze (painting technique)|glazes]], and transparency.

==History==
Woodblock-printed books from Chinese [[Buddhist]] temples were seen in Japan as early as the eighth century. In 764 the [[Empress Kōken]] commissioned one million small wooden pagodas, each containing a small woodblock scroll printed with a Buddhist text (''[[Hyakumantō Darani]]'').  These were distributed to temples around the country as thanksgiving for the suppression of the [[Fujiwara no Nakamaro|Emi Rebellion]] of 764.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.schoyencollection.com/Pre-Gutenberg.htm#2489&lt;/ref&gt; These are the earliest examples of woodblock printing known, or bobs on documented, from Japan.

By the eleventh century, Buddhist temples in Japan produced printed books of sutras, mandalas, and other Buddhist texts and images. For centuries, printing was mainly restricted to the Buddhist sphere, as it was too expensive for mass production, and did not have a receptive, literate public as a market.  However, an important set of fans of the late [[Heian period]] (12th century), containing painted images and Buddhist [[sutra]]s, reveal from loss of paint that the [[underdrawing]] for the paintings was printed from blocks.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, 136&lt;/ref&gt;

The first secular book was written in Japan in 1781. This was the ''Setsuyō-shū'', a two-volume Chinese-Japanese dictionary. Though the [[Jesuits]] operated a movable type [[printing press]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] from 1590,&lt;ref name="FB"&gt;[[Fernand Braudel]], "Civilization &amp; Capitalism, 15–18th Centuries, Vol 1: The Structures of Everyday Life," William Collins &amp; Sons, London 1981&lt;/ref&gt; printing equipment brought back by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s army from [[Korea]] in 1593 had far greater influence on the development of the medium{{Citation needed|reason=Bold claim, please provide evidence.|date=April 2017}}. Four years later, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], even before becoming shogun, effected the creation of the first native [[moveable type]], using wooden type-pieces rather than metal. He oversaw the creation of 100,000 type-pieces, which were used to print a number of political and historical texts. As shogun, Ieyasu promoted literacy and learning, contributing to the emergence of an educated urban public.

Printing was not dominated by the shogunate at this point, however. Private printers appeared in Kyoto at the beginning of the 17th century, and [[Toyotomi Hideyori]], Ieyasu's primary political opponent, aided in the development and spread of the medium as well. An edition of the [[Confucius|Confucian]] ''[[Analects]]'' was printed in 1598, using a Korean moveable type printing press, at the order of [[Emperor Go-Yōzei]]. This document is the oldest work of Japanese moveable type printing extant today. Despite the appeal of moveable type, however, craftsmen soon decided that the [[running script]] style of Japanese writings was better reproduced using woodblocks. By 1640 woodblocks were once again used for nearly all purposes.

The medium quickly gained popularity, and was used to produce affordable prints as well as books. The great pioneers in applying this method to the creation of artistic books, and in preceding mass production for general consumption, were [[Honami Kōetsu]] and [[Suminokura Soan]]. At their studio in [[Saga, Kyoto|Saga]], the pair created a number of woodblock versions of the Japanese classics, both text and images, essentially converting [[emaki|handscrolls]] to printed books, and reproducing them for wider consumption. These books, now known as Kōetsu Books, Suminokura Books, or Saga Books, are considered the first and finest printed reproductions of many of these classic tales; the Saga Book of the Tales of Ise (''[[Ise monogatari]]''), printed in 1608, is especially renowned.

Woodblock printing, though more time-consuming and expensive than later methods, was far less so than the traditional method of writing out each copy of a book by hand; thus, Japan began to see something of literary mass production. While the Saga books were printed on expensive paper, and used various embellishments, being printed specifically for a small circle of literary connoisseurs, other printers in Kyoto quickly adapted the technique to producing cheaper books in large numbers, for more general consumption. The content of these books varied widely, including travel guides, advice manuals, ''[[kibyōshi]]'' (satirical novels), ''[[sharebon]]'' (books on urban culture), art books, and play scripts for the ''[[Ningyō jōruri|jōruri]]'' (puppet) theatre. Often, within a certain genre, such as the ''jōruri'' theatre scripts, a particular style of writing became standard for that genre. For example, one person's personal calligraphic style was adopted as the standard style for printing plays.

Many publishing houses arose and grew, publishing both books and single-sheet prints. One of the most famous and successful was [[Tsutaya Jūzaburō|Tsuta-ya]]. A publisher's ownership of the physical woodblocks used to print a given text or image constituted the closest equivalent to a concept of "[[copyright]]" that existed at this time. Publishers or individuals could buy woodblocks from one another, and thus take over the production of certain texts, but beyond the ownership of a given set of blocks (and thus a very particular representation of a given subject), there was no legal conception of the ownership of ideas. Plays were adopted by competing theaters, and either reproduced wholesale, or individual plot elements or characters might be adapted; this activity was considered legitimate and routine at the time.

After the decline of ''ukiyo-e'' and introduction of movable type and other technologies, woodblock printing continued as a method for printing texts as well as for producing art, both within traditional modes such as ''ukiyo-e'' and in a variety of more radical or Western forms that might be construed as [[modern art]]. Institutes such as the "Adachi Institute of Woodblock Prints" and "Takezasado" continue to produce ukiyo-e prints with the same materials and methods as used in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adachi-hanga.com/|title=浮世絵・木版画のアダチ版画研究所|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.takezasa.co.jp/|title=木版印刷・伝統木版画工房  竹笹堂|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
[[Image:Kinryuzan Temple in Asakusa from the series Famous Places in the Eastern Capital by Hiroshige II.jpg|thumb|''[[Aizuri-e]]'' print: ''Kinryuzan Temple in Asakusa'' from the series ''Famous Places in the Eastern Capital'' by [[Hiroshige II]]]]

The technique for printing texts and images was generally similar. The obvious differences were the volume produced when working with texts (many pages for a single work), and the complexity of multiple colors in some images. Images in books were almost always in monochrome (black ink only), and for a time art prints were likewise monochrome or done in only two or three colors.

The text or image was first drawn onto thin ''[[washi]]'' (Japanese paper), then glued face-down onto a plank of close-grained wood, usually a block of smooth cherry.  Oil could be used to make the lines of the image more visible. An incision was made along both sides of each line or area. Wood was then chiseled away, based on the drawing outlines.  The block was inked using a brush or brushes.  A flat hand-held tool called a ''[[Baren (printing tool)|baren]]'' was used to press the paper against the inked woodblock to apply the ink to the paper. The traditional baren is made in three parts, it consists of an inner core made from bamboo leaves twisted into a rope of varying thicknesses, the nodules thus created are what ultimately applies the pressure to the print. This coil is contained in a disk called an "ategawa" made from layers of very thin paper which is glued together and wrapped in a dampened bamboo leaf, the ends of which are then tied to create a handle. Modern printmakers have adapted this tool, and today barens are made of aluminum with ball bearings to apply the pressure are used; as well as less expensive plastic versions. Although the first prints were simply one-color, with additional colors applied by hand, the development of two registration marks carved into the blocks called "kento" were added. The sheet of washi to be printed is placed in the kento, then lowered onto the woodblock. This was especially helpful with the introduction of multiple colors that had to be applied with precision over previous ink layers.

While, again, text was nearly always monochrome, as were images in books, the growth of the popularity of ''ukiyo-e'' brought with it demand for ever increasing numbers of colors and complexity of techniques. The stages of this development follow:
*{{nihongo|''Sumizuri-e''|墨摺り絵||"ink printed pictures"}}—monochrome printing using only black ink
*{{nihongo|''[[Benizuri-e]]''|紅摺り絵||"crimson printed pictures"}}—red ink details or highlights added by hand after the printing process；green was sometimes used as well
*{{nihongo|''Tan-e''|丹絵}}—orange highlights using a red pigment called ''tan''
*{{nihongo|''[[Aizuri-e]]''|藍摺り絵||"indigo printed pictures"}}, {{nihongo|''Murasaki-e''|紫絵||"purple pictures"}}, and other styles in which a single color was used in addition to, or instead of, black ink
*{{nihongo|''[[Urushi-e]]''|漆絵}}—a method that thickened the ink with glue, emboldening the image. Printers often used gold, mica, and other substances to enhance the image further. ''Urushi-e'' can also refer to paintings using [[lacquer]] instead of paint. Lacquer was rarely, if ever, used on prints.
*{{nihongo|''[[Nishiki-e]]''|錦絵||"brocade pictures"}}—a method of using multiple blocks for separate portions of the image, using a number of colors to achieve complex and detailed images. A separate block was carved to apply only the part of the image designated for a single color. Registration marks called ''kentō'' ({{lang|ja|見当}}) were used to ensure correspondence between the application of each block.

==Schools and movements==
[[File:Shoki2.jpg|thumb|150px|"Shōki zu" (Zhong Kui), by [[Okumura Masanobu]], 1741–1751.  An example of pillar print format, 69.2 x 10.1 cm.]]

Japanese printmaking, as with many other features of Japanese art, tended to organize itself into schools and movements. The most notable schools (see also [[schools of ukiyo-e artists]]) and, later, movements of ''moku-hanga'' were:

*[[Torii school]], from 1700
*[[Kaigetsudō school]], from 1700–14
*[[Katsukawa school]], from about 1720s, including the artists [[Shunsho]] and [[Shuntei]]&lt;ref name="Japan, Frank A 1966"&gt;The Prints of Japan, Frank A. Turk, October House Inc ,1966, Lib Congress catalog Card no. 66-25524&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Kawamata school]], from about 1725, including the artists [[Suzuki Harunobu]] and [[Koryusai]]&lt;ref name="Japan, Frank A 1966"/&gt;
*[[Hokusai school]], from about 1786, including the artists [[Hokusai]], [[Shunbaisai Hokuei|Hokuei]] and [[Gakutei]] &lt;ref name="Japan, Frank A 1966"/&gt;
*[[Kitagawa school]], from about 1794, including the artists [[Utamaro|Utamaro I]], [[Kikumaro I]] and [[Kikumaro II|II]]&lt;ref name="Japan, Frank A 1966"/&gt;
*[[Utagawa school]], from 1842, including the artists [[Kunisada]] and [[Hiroshige]]&lt;ref name="Japan, Frank A 1966"/&gt;
*[[Sōsaku-hanga]], "Creative Prints" movement, from 1904
*[[Shin-hanga]] "New Prints" movement, from 1915, including [[Hasui Kawase]] and [[Hiroshi Yoshida]] &lt;ref&gt;Fresh Impressions, Kendall Brown, Publisher: University of Washington Press, September 2013, {{ISBN|0935172513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artists, such as [[Sharaku]], [[Kabukidō Enkyō]], Sugakudo, and [[Shibata Zesshin]], are considered independent artists, free of school associations, and presumably, without the resulting associated benefits from publishers, who might be less inclined to produce prints by an unaffiliated artist. However, many of the surviving examples speak to the contrary. The earliest examples by these artists, are among the most desirable, valuable, and rarest, of all ukiyo-e. Additionally, many examples exhibit very fine printing, using expensive mica, premium inks and the highest quality papers.&lt;ref name="Japan, Frank A 1966"/&gt;

==Print sizes==
&lt;!-- The articles "Hosoban" and "Oban (disambiguation)" redirect to this section. If you modify the section's title "Print sizes", please modify these two articles as well! --&gt;

Following are common Tokugawa-period print sizes. Sizes varied depending on the period, and those given are approximate; they are based on the pre-printing paper sizes, and paper was often trimmed after printing.{{sfn|Faulkner|Robinson|1999|p=40}}
