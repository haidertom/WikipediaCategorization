In [[futures studies]] and the [[history of technology]], '''accelerating change''' is a perceived increase in the rate of [[technological change]] throughout history, which may suggest faster and more profound change in the future and may or may not be accompanied by equally profound social and cultural change&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Being surprised and surprising ourselves: a geography of personal and social change. Progress in Human Geography, OnlineFirst, pp. 1-20, https://doi.org/10.1177/0309132518810431 .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rees, M., 2018. On the future: prospects for humanity. Princeton: Princeton University Press &lt;/ref&gt;.

== Early observations ==
In 1910 during the town planning conference of London [[Daniel Burnham]] noted that "But it is not merely in the number of facts or sorts of knowledge that progress lies: it is still more in the geometric ratio of sophistication, in the [[geometric growth|geometric widening]] of the sphere of knowledge, which every year is taking in a larger percentage of people as time goes on."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/transactions00town|title=Transactions|first1=England)|last1=Town Planning Conference (1910 : London|last2=Royal Institute of British Architects|date=8 July 2018|publisher=London : Royal Institute of British Architects|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later on  "It is the argument with which I began, that a mighty change having come about in fifty years, and our pace of development having immensely accelerated, our sons and grandsons are going to demand and get results that would stagger us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/transactions00town|title=Transactions|first1=England)|last1=Town Planning Conference (1910 : London|last2=Royal Institute of British Architects|date=8 July 2018|publisher=London : Royal Institute of British Architects|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, [[Buckminster Fuller]] introduced the word [[ephemeralization]] to describe the trends of "doing more with less" in chemistry, health and other areas of [[industrial development]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Buckminster Fuller|R. Buckminster Fuller]], ''[[Nine Chains to the Moon]]'', [[Southern Illinois University Press]] [1938] 1963 pp.&amp;nbsp;276–79.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1946, Fuller published a chart of the discoveries of the chemical elements over time to highlight the development of accelerating acceleration in human knowledge acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Buckminster Fuller|R. Buckminster Fuller]], ''[[Synergetics (Fuller)]]'', http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s04/figs/f1903.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, [[Stanislaw Ulam]] wrote in reference to a conversation with [[John von Neumann]]: {{quote|One conversation centered on the ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.&lt;ref name="mathematical"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-5-JeCa2Z7hbWcxTGsyU09HSTg/edit?pli=1 | last=Ulam|first=Stanislaw |title=Tribute to John von Neumann|publisher=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|volume= 64, nr 3, part 2|date=May 1958|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Moravec's ''Mind Children''==
In a series of published articles from 1974–1979, and then in his 1988 book ''Mind Children'', computer scientist and futurist [[Hans Moravec]] generalizes [[Moore's law]] to make predictions about the future of artificial life. Moore's law describes an [[exponential growth]] pattern in the complexity of integrated semiconductor circuits. Moravec extends this to include technologies from long before the integrated circuit to future forms of technology. Moravec outlines a timeline and a scenario&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm| journal=Journal of Evolution and Technology| date=1998| volume=1| title=When will computer hardware match the human brain?| first=Hans| last=Moravec| accessdate=2006-06-23| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031852/http://transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm| archivedate=15 June 2006| deadurl=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1993/Robot93.html| title= The Age of Robots|date=June 1993| first=Hans| last=Moravec| accessdate=2006-06-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060615055406/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1993/Robot93.html| archivedate= 15 June 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which robots will evolve into a new series of artificial species, starting around 2030–2040.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/2004/Predictions.html| title=Robot Predictions Evolution| first=Hans| last=Moravec|date=April 2004| accessdate=2006-06-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060616045535/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/2004/Predictions.html| archivedate= 16 June 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind'', published in 1998, Moravec further considers the implications of evolving [[robot intelligence]], generalizing [[Moore's Law]] to technologies predating the [[integrated circuit]], and also plotting the exponentially increasing computational power of the brains of animals in evolutionary history. Extrapolating these trends, he speculates about a coming "mind fire"  of rapidly expanding [[superintelligence]] similar to the [[intelligence explosion|explosion of intelligence]] predicted by Vinge.

== James Burke's ''Connections'' ==
{{Main|Connections (TV series)}}

In his TV series ''[[Connections (TV series)|Connections]]'' (1978)&amp;mdash;and sequels ''Connections²'' (1994) and ''Connections³'' (1997)&amp;mdash;[[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] explores an "Alternative View of Change" (the subtitle of the series) that rejects the conventional linear and teleological view of historical progress. Burke contends that one cannot consider the development of any particular piece of the modern world in isolation. Rather, the entire gestalt of the modern world is the result of a web of interconnected events, each one consisting of a person or group acting for reasons of their own motivations (e.g., profit, curiosity, religious) with no concept of the final, modern result to which the actions of either them or their contemporaries would lead. The interplay of the results of these isolated events is what drives history and innovation, and is also the main focus of the series and its sequels.

Burke also explores three corollaries to his initial thesis. The first is that, if history is driven by individuals who act only on what they know at the time, and not because of any idea as to where their actions will eventually lead, then predicting the future course of technological progress is merely conjecture. Therefore, if we are astonished by the connections Burke is able to weave among past events, then we will be equally surprised to what the events of today eventually will lead, especially events we weren't even aware of at the time.

The second and third corollaries are explored most in the introductory and concluding episodes, and they represent the downside of an interconnected history. If history progresses because of the synergistic interaction of past events and innovations, then as history does progress, the number of these events and innovations increases. This increase in possible connections causes the process of innovation to not only continue, but to accelerate. Burke poses the question of what happens when this rate of innovation, or more importantly change itself, becomes too much for the average person to handle, and what this means for individual power, liberty, and privacy.

== Gerald Hawkins' ''Mindsteps'' ==

In his book "Mindsteps to the Cosmos" (HarperCollins, August 1983), [[Gerald Hawkins|Gerald S. Hawkins]] elucidated his notion of 'mindsteps', dramatic and irreversible changes to [[paradigms]] or world views. He identified five distinct mindsteps in human history, and the technology that accompanied these "new world views": the invention of imagery, writing, mathematics, printing, the telescope, rocket, radio, TV, computer... "Each one takes the collective mind closer to reality, one stage further along in its understanding of the relation of humans to the cosmos." He noted: "The waiting period between the mindsteps is getting shorter. One can't help noticing the acceleration." Hawkins' empirical 'mindstep equation' quantified this, and gave dates for future mindsteps. The date of the next mindstep (5; the series begins at 0) is given as 2021, with two further, successively closer mindsteps in 2045 and 2051, until the limit of the series in 2053. His speculations ventured beyond the technological:

{{quote|The mindsteps... appear to have certain things in common - a new and unfolding human perspective, related inventions in the area of memes and communications, and a long formulative waiting period before the next mindstep comes along. None of the mindsteps can be said to have been truly anticipated, and most were resisted at the early stages. In looking to the future we may equally be caught unawares. We may have to grapple with the presently inconceivable, with mind-stretching discoveries and concepts.}}

==Vinge's exponentially accelerating change==
The mathematician [[Vernor Vinge]] popularized his ideas about exponentially accelerating technological change in the science fiction novel ''[[Marooned in Realtime]]'' (1986), set in a world of rapidly accelerating progress leading to the emergence of more and more sophisticated technologies separated by shorter and shorter time intervals, until a point beyond human comprehension is reached. His subsequent [[Hugo award]]-winning novel ''[[A Fire Upon the Deep]]'' (1992) starts with an imaginative description of the evolution of a [[superintelligence]] passing through exponentially accelerating developmental stages ending in a [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], almost [[omnipotent]] power unfathomable by mere humans. His already mentioned influential 1993 paper on the [[technological singularity]] compactly summarizes the basic ideas.

==Kurzweil's ''The Law of Accelerating Returns''{{anchor|The Law of Accelerating Returns|Law of Accelerating Returns}}==

In his 1999 book ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'', [[Ray Kurzweil]] proposed "The Law of Accelerating Returns", according to which the rate of change in a wide variety of evolutionary systems (including but not limited to the growth of technologies) tends to increase exponentially.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Kurzweil, ''The Age of Spiritual Machines'', Viking, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ldAGcyh0bkUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA630#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 30] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=ldAGcyh0bkUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA632#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 32]&lt;/ref&gt; He gave further focus to this issue in a 2001 essay entitled "The Law of Accelerating Returns".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns ''The Law of Accelerating Returns'']. [[Ray Kurzweil]], March 7, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Kurzweil, after Moravec, argued for extending Moore's Law to describe [[exponential growth]] of diverse forms of [[technology|technological]] progress.  Whenever a technology approaches some kind of a barrier, according to Kurzweil, a new technology will be invented to allow us to cross that barrier. He cites numerous past examples of this to substantiate his assertions. He predicts that such [[paradigm shift]]s have and will continue to become increasingly common, leading to "technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history." He believes the Law of Accelerating Returns implies that a [[technological singularity]] will occur before the end of the 21st century, around 2045. The essay begins:

{{quote|An analysis of the history of technology shows that technological change is exponential, contrary to the common-sense 'intuitive linear' view. So we won't experience 100 years of progress in the 21st century—it will be more like 20,000 years of progress (at today's rate). The 'returns,' such as chip speed and cost-effectiveness, also increase exponentially. There's even exponential growth in the rate of exponential growth. Within a few decades, machine intelligence will surpass human intelligence, leading to the Singularity—technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history. The implications include the merger of biological and nonbiological intelligence, immortal software-based humans, and ultra-high levels of intelligence that expand outward in the universe at the speed of light.}}

[[Image:PPTMooresLawai.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Moore's Law expanded to other technologies]]
[[File:Moore's_Law_over_120_Years.png|thumb|right|200px|An updated version of Moore's Law over 120 Years (based on [[Ray Kurzweil|Kurzweil's]] [[c:File:PPTMooresLawai.jpg|graph]]). The 7 most recent data points are all [[Nvidia GPUs|NVIDIA GPUs]].]]
The Law of Accelerating Returns has in many ways altered public perception of [[Moore's law]]. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}} It is a common (but mistaken) belief that Moore's law makes predictions regarding all forms of technology,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} when really it only concerns semiconductor circuits. Many [[futurist]]s still use the term "Moore's law" to describe ideas like those put forth by Moravec, Kurzweil and others.

According to Kurzweil, since the beginning of [[evolution]], more complex life forms have been evolving exponentially faster, with shorter and shorter intervals between the emergence of radically new life forms, such as human beings, who have the capacity to engineer (i.e. intentionally design with efficiency) a new trait which replaces relatively blind evolutionary mechanisms of selection for efficiency. By extension, the rate of technical progress amongst humans has also been exponentially increasing, as we discover more effective ways to do things, we also discover more effective ways to learn, i.e. [[language]], numbers, written language, [[philosophy]], [[scientific method]], instruments of observation, tallying devices, mechanical calculators, computers, each of these major advances in our ability to account for information occur increasingly close together. Already within the past sixty years, life in the industrialized world has changed almost beyond recognition except for living memories from the first half of the 20th century. This pattern will culminate in unimaginable technological progress in the 21st century, leading to a singularity. Kurzweil elaborates on his views in his books ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'' and ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]''.

==Criticisms==
Examples of large human "buy-ins" into technology include the [[computer revolution]], as well as massive government projects like the [[Manhattan Project]] and the [[Human Genome Project]]. The foundation organizing the [[Methuselah Mouse Prize]] believes [[aging research]] could be the subject of such a massive project if substantial progress is made in slowing or reversing [[cellular aging]] in mice.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Both [[Theodore Modis]] and Jonathan Huebner have argued—each from different perspectives—that the rate of technological innovation has not only ceased to rise, but is actually now declining.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Korotayev A.

In fact, "[[technological singularity]]" is just one of a few singularities detected through the analysis of a number of characteristics of the [[World Systems Theory|World System]] development, for example, with respect to the [[world population]], world GDP, and some other economic indices.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Johansen, A., and D.

&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[hyperbolic growth|hyperbolic]] pattern of the world demographic, economic, cultural, urbanistic, and technological growth (observed for many centuries, if not millennia prior to the 1970s) could be accounted for by a rather simple mechanism, the nonlinear second-order [[positive feedback]], that was shown long ago to generate precisely the [[hyperbolic growth]], known also as the "blow-up regime" (implying just [[finite-time singularities]]). In our case this nonlinear second order positive feedback looks as follows: more people – more potential inventors – faster technological growth – the [[carrying capacity]] of the Earth grows faster – faster [[population growth]] – more people – more potential inventors  – faster technological growth, and so on. On the other hand, this research has shown that since the 1970s the World System  does not develop hyperbolically any more, its development diverges more and more from the blow-up regime, and at present it is moving "from singularity", rather than "toward singularity".&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev]] A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D.

[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] calls the Singularity "[[Omega]]", referring to [[Teilhard de Chardin]]'s [[Omega Point]] (1916). For Omega = 2040, he says the series Omega - 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; human lifetimes (n &lt; 10; one lifetime = 80 years) roughly matches the most important events in [[human history]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

'''Arbitrariness''' is the quality of being "determined by chance, whim, or impulse, and not by necessity, reason, or principle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/arbitrariness|title=arbitrariness|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=21 April 2018|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arbitrary decisions are not necessarily the same as [[random]] decisions.  For example, during the [[1973 oil crisis]], Americans were allowed to purchase gasoline only on odd-numbered days if their license plate was odd, and on even-numbered days if their license plate was even.  The system was well-defined and not random in its restrictions; however, since license plate numbers are completely unrelated to a person's fitness to purchase gasoline, it was still an arbitrary division of people.  Similarly, schoolchildren are often organized by their [[surname]] in alphabetical order, a non-random yet still arbitrary method, at least in cases where surnames are irrelevant.

==Law== 
''Arbitrary'' comes from the Latin ''arbitrarius'', the source of ''arbiter''; someone who is tasked to judge some matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=arbitrary Online Etymology Dictionary]: "'deciding by one's own discretion,' from L. arbitrarius, from arbiter (see arbiter). The original meaning gradually to mean ‘capricious’ (1646) and ‘despotic’ (1642).”&lt;/ref&gt;  An arbitrary legal judgment is a decision made at the discretion of the judge, not one that is fixed by  law.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Thomas.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=p31MAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA565&amp;lpg=PA565&amp;dq=%22discretion+of+the+judge%22+and+arbitrary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tl9MMK-av4&amp;sig=Zd8y_5GB9g8c-GX0qg87BHllhqo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ShbJSZylDcrJtgeM-IyUAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result#PPA565,M1 The London Encyclopaedia]'', page 565 (1829): “Arbitrary, and the words more immediately connected with it, signify that the decision of the arbiter is made in consequence of his own uncontrolled will, or in consequence of reasons which do not appear.”&lt;/ref&gt;  In some countries, a prohibition of arbitrariness is enshrined into the [[constitution]].  Article 9 of the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] theoretically overrides even democratic decisions in prohibiting arbitrary government action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/rs/1/101.en.pdf Federal Constitution of the Swiss Federation]. The Federal Authorities
of the Swiss Confederation.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] has overturned laws for having "[[Rational basis review|no rational basis]]."  A recent study of the U.S. asylum system suggests that arbitrariness in decision-making might be the cause of large disparities in outcomes between different adjudicators, a phenomenon described as [[refugee roulette]].

Article 330 of the Russian penal code defines 'Arbitrariness' as a specific crime, but with a very broad definition encompassing any 'actions contrary to the order presented by a law'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  |work=The Criminal Code Of The Russian Federation

  |quote=Arbitrariness, that is the unauthorized commission of actions contrary to the order presented by a law or any other normative legal act, 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Arbitrary actions are closely related to [[teleology]], the study of purpose.  Actions lacking a ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]'', a goal, are necessarily arbitrary.  With no end to measure against, there can be no standard applied to choices, so all decisions are alike.  Note that arbitrary or random methods in the standard sense of ''arbitrary'' may not qualify as arbitrary choices philosophically, if they were done in furtherance of a larger purpose; in the examples above, discipline in school and avoiding overcrowding at gas stations.

[[Nihilism]] is the philosophy that believes that there is no purpose in the universe, and that ''every'' choice is arbitrary.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, Bernd (1971). "Nihilism, Reason, and "The Good"." ''The Review of Metaphysics.'' '''25''' (2):292&amp;ndash;310.&lt;/ref&gt; According to nihilism, the universe contains no value and is essentially meaningless. Because the universe and all of its constituents contain no higher goal for us to make subgoals from, all aspects of human life and experiences are completely arbitrary. There is no right or wrong decision, thought or practice, and whatever choice a human being makes is just as meaningless and empty as any other choice he or she could have made.

Many brands of [[theism]], the belief in a [[deity]] or deities, believe that everything has a purpose and that ''nothing'' is arbitrary.  In these philosophies, God created the universe for a reason, and every event flows from that.  Even seemingly random events cannot escape God's hand and purpose.  This is somewhat related to the [[argument from design]], the argument for God's existence because a purpose can be found in the universe.

Arbitrariness is also related to [[ethics]], the philosophy of decision-making.  Even if a person has a goal, they may choose to attempt to achieve it in ways that may be considered arbitrary.  [[Rationalism]] holds that knowledge comes about through intellectual calculation and deduction; many rationalists (though not all) apply this to ethics as well.  All decisions should be made through reason and logic, not via whim or how one "feels" what is right.  Randomness may occasionally be acceptable as part of a subtask in furtherance of a larger goal, but not in general.

In [[semiotics]], the general theory of signs, sign systems, and sign processes, [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] introduced the notion of [[Course in General Linguistics#Arbitrariness|arbitrariness]] according to which there is no necessary connection between the material sign (or ''signifier'') and the entity it refers to or denotes as its meaning (or ''signified'') as a mental concept or real object.

==Mathematics==
In mathematics, arbitrary normally means "any;" for instance, an arbitrary division of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] or an arbitrary [[permutation]] of a sequence.  Its use implies generality and that a statement does not only apply to special cases &amp;ndash; "you may select any choice possible, and this statement will still hold."  A simple example would be "Given an arbitrary integer, multiplying it by two will result in an [[Even and odd numbers|even number]]."

Even further, the implication is that generality will hold even if you have an opponent choose the item in question.  In some ways ''arbitrary'' is here synonymous with ''worst-case''.&lt;ref&gt;Tel, Gérard (2000). ''Introduction to distributed algorithms.'' Cambridge University Press. p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blindsight''' is the ability of people who are [[Cortical blindness|cortically blind]] due to lesions in their [[striate cortex]], also known as primary [[visual cortex]] or V1, to respond to visual stimuli that they do not consciously see.&lt;ref name="Visual perception and awareness"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Celesia G | year = 2010 | title = Visual perception and awareness: a modular system | url = | journal = Journal of Psychophysiology | volume = 24 | issue = 2| pages = 62–67 | doi = 10.1027/0269-8803/a000014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of studies on blindsight are conducted on patients who have the conscious blindness on only one side of their [[visual field]]. Following the destruction of the striate cortex, patients are asked to detect, localize, and discriminate amongst visual stimuli that are presented to their blind side, often in a forced-response or guessing situation, even though they do not consciously recognize the visual stimulus. Research shows that blind patients achieve a higher accuracy than would be expected from chance alone. ''Type 1 blindsight'' is the term given to this ability to guess—at levels significantly above chance—aspects of a visual stimulus (such as location or type of movement) without any conscious awareness of any stimuli. ''Type 2 blindsight'' occurs when patients claim to have a feeling that there has been a change within their blind area—e.g. movement—but that it was not a visual [[percept]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lawrence |last=Weiskrantz |year=1997 |title=Consciousness Lost and Found: A Neuropsychological Exploration |isbn=0-19-852301-7 |authorlink=Lawrence Weiskrantz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blindsight challenges the common belief that perceptions must enter consciousness to affect our behavior; showing that our behavior can be guided by sensory information of which we have no conscious awareness.&lt;ref name="Carlson 2013 4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Physiology of Behavior|last=Carlson|first=Neil|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|year=2013|isbn=978-0-205-23981-8|edition=11th|location=University of Massachusetts, Amherst|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be thought of as a converse of the form of [[anosognosia]] known as [[Anton–Babinski syndrome]], in which there is full cortical blindness along with the [[confabulation]] of visual experience.

== History ==
We owe much of our current understanding of blindsight to early experiments on [[monkeys]]. One monkey in particular, Helen, could be considered the "star monkey in visual research" because she was the original blindsight subject. Helen was a [[macaque monkey]] that had been decorticated; specifically, her [[primary visual cortex]] (V1) was completely removed, blinding her. Nevertheless, under certain specific situations, Helen exhibited sighted behavior. Her [[pupils]] would dilate and she would [[blink]] at stimuli that threatened her eyes. Furthermore, under certain experimental conditions, she could detect a variety of visual stimuli, such as the presence and location of objects, as well as shape, pattern, orientation, motion, and color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Humphrey N | year = 1970 | title = What the frog's eye tells the monkey's brain | url = | journal = Brain, Behavior, and Evolution | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 324–337 | doi=10.1159/000125480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Humphrey N|first=|date=|year=1974|title=Vision in a monkey without striate cortex: A case study|url=http://www.humphrey.org.uk/papers/1974helen.pdf|journal=Perception|volume=3|issue=|pages=241–255|doi=10.1068/p030241|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[A History of the Mind]]|last=Humphrey|first=Nicholas|date=1992|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=|isbn=9780671686444|location=New York|pages=|oclc=25915998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2018}} In many cases, she was able to navigate her environment and interact with objects as if she were sighted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Blindsight and the Nature of Consciousness|last=Holt|first=Jason|date=2003|publisher=Broadview Press|year=|isbn=978-1-55111-351-7|location=Peterborough, Ontario|pages=|oclc=50755257}}{{Page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar phenomenon was also discovered in humans. Subjects who had suffered damage to their visual cortices due to accidents or [[stroke]]s reported partial or total blindness. In spite of this, when they were prompted they could "guess" with above-average accuracy about the presence and details of objects, much like the animal subjects, and they could even catch objects that were tossed at them. The subjects never developed any kind of confidence in their abilities. Even when told of their successes, they would not begin to spontaneously make "guesses" about objects, but instead still required prompting. Furthermore, blindsight subjects rarely express the amazement about their abilities that sighted people would expect them to express.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seeing Red: A Study in Consciousness|last=Humphrey|first=Nicholas|date=2006|publisher=Belknap Press|year=|isbn=978-0-674-02179-2|series=Mind/brain/behavior initiative|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=|oclc=234101445}}{{Page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Describing blindsight ==

Patients with blindsight have damage to the visual system that allows perception (the [[visual cortex]] of the brain and some of the [[nerve fibers]] that bring information to it from the [[eyes]]) rather than the system that controls eye movements.&lt;ref name="Carlson 2013 4"/&gt; This phenomenon shows how, after the more complex visual system is damaged, people can use the latter visual system of their brains to guide hand movements towards an object even though they cannot see what they are reaching for.&lt;ref name="Carlson 2013 4"/&gt; Hence, visual information can control behavior without producing a [[conscious]] sensation. This ability of those with blindsight to "see" objects that they are unconscious of suggests that consciousness is not a general property of all parts of the brain; yet it suggests that only certain parts of the brain play a special role in consciousness.&lt;ref name="Carlson 2013 4"/&gt;

Blindsight patients show awareness of single visual features, such as edges and motion, but cannot gain a holistic visual percept. This suggests that perceptual awareness is [[modular]] and that—in sighted individuals—there is a "binding process that unifies all information into a whole percept", which is interrupted in patients with such conditions as blindsight and [[visual agnosia]].&lt;ref name="Visual perception and awareness" /&gt; Therefore, object identification and object recognition are thought to be separate processes and occur in different areas of the brain, working independently from one another. The modular theory of object perception and integration would account for the "hidden perception" experienced in blindsight patients. Research has shown that visual stimuli with the single visual features of sharp borders, sharp onset/offset times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Alexander I. |author2=Cowey A. | year = 2010 | title = Edges, colour and awareness in blindsight | url = | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 520–533 | doi=10.1016/j.concog.2010.01.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; motion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ffytche|first=D.H.|last2=[[Semir Zeki|Zeki]]|first2=S.|date=2011|title=The primary visual cortex, and feedback to it, are not necessary for conscious vision|url=|journal=Brain|volume=134|pages=247–257|doi=10.1093/brain/awq305|via=|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; and low [[spatial frequency]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sahraiea A. |author2=Hibbardb P. |author3=Trevethana C. |author4=Ritchiea K. |author5=Weiskrantz L. | year = 2010 | title = Consciousness of the first order in blindsight | journal = PNAS | volume = 107 | issue = 49| pages = 21217–21222 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1015652107 | pmid=21078979 | pmc=3000284}}&lt;/ref&gt; contribute to, but are not strictly necessary for, an object's salience in blindsight.

== Cause ==

There are three theories for the explanation of blindsight. The first states that after damage to area V1, other branches of the [[optic nerve]] deliver visual information to the [[superior colliculus]] and several other areas, including parts of the [[cerebral cortex]]. In turn, these areas might then control the blindsight responses.

Another explanation for the phenomenon of blindsight is that even though the majority of a person's visual cortex may be damaged, tiny islands of functioning tissue remain. These islands aren't large enough to provide conscious perception, but nevertheless enough for some unconscious visual perception.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Biological Psychology|last=Kalat|first=James W.|date=2009|publisher=Wadsworth|year=|isbn=9780495603009|edition=10th|location=Belmont, California|pages=169–170|oclc=236316740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third theory is that the information required to determine the distance to and velocity of an object in object space is determined by the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] before the information is projected to the visual cortex. In a normal subject, these signals are used to merge the information from the eyes into a three-dimensional representation (which includes the position and velocity of individual objects relative to the organism), extract a vergence signal to benefit the precision (previously auxiliary) optical system, and extract a focus control signal for the [[Lens (anatomy)|lenses]] of the eyes. The [[Stereoscopic acuity|stereoscopic]] information is attached to the object information passed to the visual cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Fulton, J. (2004) Processes in Biological Vision Section 7.4 {{cite web |url=http://neuronresearch.net/vision/pdf/7Dynamics.pdf/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221000725/http://neuronresearch.net/vision/pdf/7Dynamics.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of blindsight can be indirectly observed in children as young as two months, although there is difficulty in determining the type in a patient who is not old enough to answer questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=2005|title=Blindsight in children: Does it exist and can it be used to help the child?

== Evidence in animals ==

In a 1995 experiment, researchers attempted to show that monkeys with lesions in or even wholly removed striate cortexes also suffered from blindsight. To do this, they had the monkeys complete a task similar to the tasks commonly used on human patients with the disorder. The monkeys were placed in front of a monitor and taught to differentiate between trials where either an object in their visual field or nothing was present when a tone is played. Since blindsight causes people to not see anything in their right visual field, if the monkeys registered blank trials, or trials in which no object was presented, the same as trials in which something appeared on the right, then they would have responded the same way as a human with blindsight.{{Clarify|reason=oddly worded sentence|date=January 2018}} The monkeys did indeed perform very similar to human participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cowey|first=Alan|last2=Stoerig|first2=P.|date=|year=1995|title=Blindsight in monkeys|url=http://l3d.cs.colorado.edu/~ctg/classes/lib/cogsci/cowey.pdf|journal=Nature|volume=373|issue=6511|pages=247–249|doi=10.1038/373247a0|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another 1995 study by the same group sought to prove that monkeys too could be conscious of movement in their deficit visual field despite not being consciously aware of the presence of an object there. To do this, researchers used another standard test for humans with the condition. The test was to the one he previously used; however, for this trial the object would only be presented in the deficit visual field and would move. Starting from the center of the deficit visual field, the object would either move up, down, or to the right. The monkeys performed identically to humans on the test, getting them right almost every time. This showed that the monkey's ability to detect movement is separate from their ability to consciously detect an object in their deficit visual field, and gave further evidence for the claim that damage to the striate cortex plays a large role in causing the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stoerig|first=P.|last2=Cowey|first2=A.|date=|year=1997|title=Blindsight in man and monkey|url=https://watermark.silverchair.com/1200535.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAawwggGoBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGZMIIBlQIBADCCAY4GCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMh_4fZq8XDt_cmCpRAgEQgIIBX67F91PP6UrpLVf39aOjcE74R9MUEamX52n0llQGoKxq0azmx4RZn5gHJMzSt73mkGkycOHHMwU4lpQhklWj6ypynRUl6vgHD5EyJowvWhu7w-6x4nsTTZY9Iw8t4C1Ip6RyjT63EVCNGsQeI1SDVMSyDxDzFh6sEZrH1XCaau5Zb6mDP9cFnic02l41qw2JUr22M0h5bFndikPVjq1oT1O7d_xnENu5oUjFCpj6uLznJ6XMJ8YephckVmaOMZuwdzTqMKHcgX7xoAU8vJOlZkgaJvEb_atjPKBBm9tKr57CXVm6pnkcL1tQeDeeYZQVRkhxRbeGeb4y9uPoq3VfwvUoAPQrnBDbrtC68so1-ImR_Yw2bR4JSS4sGTtRVOVr6NG7uOLWDBojpF7oBqt8fQtxPrjAjcwyyRCn5DAQoIFdv-EsZgR96DyPWLg5gXP49NVSQKbVpH7lcIW4vzpspg|journal=Brain|volume=120|issue=3|pages=535–559|doi=10.1093/brain/120.3.535|pmid=9126063|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several years later, another study compared and contrasted the data collected from monkeys and that of a specific human patient with blindsight, GY. GY's striate cortical region was damaged through [[Physical trauma|trauma]] at the age of eight, though for the most part he retained full functionality, GY was not consciously aware of anything in his right visual field. By comparing brain scars of both GY and the monkeys he had worked with, as well as their test results, the researchers concluded that the effects of striate cortical damage are the same in both species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cowey|first=Alan|last2=Alexander|first2=I.|last3=Stoerig|first3=P.|title=A blindsight conundrum: How to respond when there is no correct response|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=2008|volume=46|issue=3|pages=870–878|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.11.031|pmid=18201733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

[[Lawrence Weiskrantz]] and colleagues showed in the early 1970s that if forced to guess about whether a stimulus is present in their blind field, some observers do better than chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lawrence |last=Weiskrantz |year=1986 |title=Blindsight: A Case Study and Implications |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-852192-8 |oclc=21677307 |authorlink=Lawrence Weiskrantz}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2018}} This ability to detect stimuli that the observer is not conscious of can extend to discrimination of the type of stimulus (for example, whether an 'X' or 'O' has been presented in the blind field).

[[Electrophysiological]] evidence from the late 1970s has shown that there is no direct retinal input from [[S-cones]] to the [[superior colliculus]], implying that the perception of [[color]] information should be impaired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Monasterio|first=F.

Patients shown images on their blind side of people expressing emotions correctly guessed the emotion most of the time. The movement of facial muscles used in smiling and frowning were measured and reacted in ways that matched the kind of emotion in the unseen image. Therefore, the emotions were recognized without involving conscious sight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tamietto|first1=Marco|last2=de Gelder|first2=Beatrice|date=October 2010|title=Neural bases of the non-conscious perception of emotional signals|url=https://iris.unito.it/retrieve/handle/2318/79483/11098/Tamietto-deGelder-NRN.pdf|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|volume=11|issue=10|pages=697-709|doi=10.1038/nrn2889|issn=1471-0048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 study had patient GY discriminate between whether or not a stimulus was presented and state the opposite direction of travel for that stimulus. That is to say, if the stimulus was traveling upward, he was to indicate it was moving downward, and if it was moving downward he was to indicate that it moved upward. GY was able to do this with incredible accuracy in his left visual field; however, he consistently stated the wrong direction of travel in his deficit visual field. This indicated that though GY was aware of the movement, he was not able to apply the rule as stated by the researchers to his observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Persaud|first=Navindra|last2=Cowey|first2=Alan|title=Blindsight is unlike normal conscious vision: Evidence from an exclusion task.|journal=Consciousness &amp; Cognition|year=2008|volume=17|issue=3|pages=1050–1056|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2007.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Case studies===
{{Tone|section|date=January 2018}}

Researchers applied the same type of tests that were used to study blindsight in animals to a patient referred to as DB. The normal techniques that were used to assess visual acuity in humans involved asking them to verbally describe some visually recognizable aspect of an object or objects. DB was given forced-choice tasks to complete instead. The results of DB's guesses showed that DB was able to determine shape and detect movement at some unconscious level, despite not being visually aware of this. DB themselves chalked up the accuracy of their guesses to be merely coincidental.&lt;ref name="Weiskrantz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Blindsight|title=Blindsight|last=Weiskrantz|first=Lawrence|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of the condition known as blindsight raised questions about how different types of visual information, even unconscious information, may be affected and sometimes even unaffected by damage to different areas of the visual cortex.&lt;ref name="Stoerig"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stoerig|first=Petra|date=|year=1996|title=Varieties of vision: from blind responses to conscious recognition|url=|journal=Trends in Neurosciences|volume=19|pages=401–406|doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(96)10051-5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous studies had already demonstrated that even without conscious awareness of visual stimuli that humans could still determine certain visual features such as presence in the visual field, shape, orientation and movement.&lt;ref name="Weiskrantz" /&gt; But, in a newer study evidence showed that if the damage to the visual cortex occurs in areas above the primary visual cortex the conscious awareness of visual stimuli itself is not damaged.&lt;ref name="Stoerig" /&gt; Blindsight is a phenomenon that shows that even when the primary visual cortex is damaged or removed a person can still perform actions guided by unconscious visual information. So even when damage occurs in the area necessary for conscious awareness of visual information, other functions of the processing of these visual percepts are still available to the individual.&lt;ref name="Weiskrantz" /&gt; The same also goes for damage to other areas of the visual cortex. If an area of the cortex that is responsible for a certain function is damaged, it will only result in the loss of that particular function or aspect, functions that other parts of the visual cortex are responsible for remain intact.&lt;ref name="Stoerig" /&gt;

Alexander and Cowey investigated how contrasting brightness of stimuli affects blindsight patients' ability to discern movement. Prior studies have already shown that blindsight patients are able to detect motion even though they claim they do not see any visual percepts in their blind fields.&lt;ref name="Weiskrantz" /&gt; The subjects of the study were two patients who suffered from hemianopsia—blindness in more than half of their visual field. Both of the subjects had displayed the ability to accurately determine the presence of visual stimuli in their blind hemifields without acknowledging an actual visual percept previously.&lt;ref name="Alexander and Cowey"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alexander|first=I.|last2=Cowey|first2=A.|date=|year=2012|title=Isoluminant coloured stimuli are undetectable in blindsight even when they move|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Iona_Alexander/publication/233976642_Isoluminant_coloured_stimuli_are_undetectable_in_blindsight_even_when_they_move/links/5774fe0408ae1b18a7df9e77.pdf|journal=Experimental Brain Research|volume=225|pages=147–152|doi=10.1007/s00221-012-3355-6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To test the effect of brightness on the subject's ability to determine motion they used a white background with a series of colored dots. They would alter the contrast of the brightness of the dots compared to the white background in each different trial to see if the participants performed better or worse when there was a larger discrepancy in brightness or not.&lt;ref name="Alexander and Cowey" /&gt; Their procedure was to have the participants face the display for a period of time and ask them to tell the researchers when the dots were moving. The subjects focused on the display through two equal length time intervals. They would tell the researchers whether they thought the dots were moving during the first or the second time interval.&lt;ref name="Alexander and Cowey" /&gt;
 
When the contrast in brightness between the background and the dots was higher, both of the subjects could discern motion more accurately than they would have statistically by just guessing. However one of the subjects was not able to accurately determine whether or not blue dots were moving regardless of the brightness contrast, but he/she was able to do so with every other color dot.&lt;ref name="Alexander and Cowey" /&gt; When the contrast was highest the subjects were able to tell whether or not the dots were moving with very high rates of accuracy. Even when the dots were white, but still of a different brightness from the background, the subjects could still determine if they were moving or not. But, regardless of the dots' color the subjects could not tell when they were in motion or not when the white background and the dots were of similar brightness.&lt;ref name="Alexander and Cowey" /&gt;

Kentridge, Heywood, and Weiskrantz used the phenomenon of blindsight to investigate the connection between visual attention and visual awareness. They wanted to see if their subject—who exhibited blindsight in other studies&lt;ref name="Alexander and Cowey" /&gt;—could react more quickly when his/her attention was cued without the ability to be visually aware of it. The researchers wanted to show that being conscious of a stimulus and paying attention to it was not the same thing.&lt;ref name="Kentridge et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kentridge|first=R. W.|last2=Heywood|first2=C.A.|last3=Weiskrantz|first3=L.|date=|year=2004|title=Spatial attention speeds discrimination without awareness in blindsight|url=http://bob.kentridge.info/PDFs/2004/KentridgeHeywoodWeiskrantz2004.pdf|journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=42|pages=831–835|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2003.11.001|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To test the relationship between attention and awareness, they had the participant try to determine where a target was and whether it was oriented horizontally or vertically on a computer screen.&lt;ref name="Kentridge et al" /&gt; The target line would appear at one of two different locations and would be oriented in one of two directions. Before the target would appear an arrow would become visible on the screen and sometimes it would point to the correct position of the target line and less frequently it would not, this arrow was the cue for the subject. The participant would press a key to indicate whether the line was horizontal or vertical, and could then also indicate to an observer whether or not he/she actually had a feeling that any object was there or not—even if they couldn't see anything. The participant was able to accurately determine the orientation of the line when the target was cued by an arrow before the appearance of the target, even though these visual stimuli did not equal awareness in the subject who had no vision in that area of his/her visual field. The study showed that even without the ability to be visually aware of a stimulus the participant could still focus his/her attention on this object.&lt;ref name="Kentridge et al" /&gt;

In 2003, a patient known as TN lost use of his primary visual cortex, area V1. He had two successive [[strokes]], which knocked out the region in both his [[Left hemisphere|left]] and [[right hemisphere]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. After his strokes, ordinary tests of TN's sight turned up nothing. He could not even detect large objects moving right in front of his eyes. Researchers eventually began to notice that TN exhibited signs of blindsight and in 2008 decided to test their theory. They took TN into a hallway and asked him to walk through it without using the cane he always carried after having the strokes. TN was not aware at the time, but the researchers had placed various obstacles in the hallway to test if he could avoid them without conscious use of his sight. To the researchers' delight, he moved around every obstacle with ease, at one point even pressing himself up against the wall to squeeze past a trashcan placed in his way. After navigating through the hallway, TN reported that he was just walking the way he wanted to, not because he knew anything was there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=de Gelder B.|first=|author2=Tamietto M.|author3=van Boxtel G.|date=|year=2008|title=Intact navigation skills after bilateral loss of striate cortex|url=|journal=Current Biology|volume=18|issue=24|pages=R1128–R1129|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.11.002|pmid=19108766|via=|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another case study, a girl had brought her grandfather in to see a [[neuropsychologist]]. The girl's grandfather, Mr. J., had had a stroke which had left him completely blind apart from a tiny spot in the middle of his visual field. The neuropsychologist, Dr. M., performed an exercise with him. The doctor helped Mr. J. to a chair, had him sit down, and then asked to borrow his cane. The doctor then asked, "Mr. J., please look straight ahead. Keep looking that way, and don't move your eyes or turn your head. I know that you can see a little bit straight ahead of you, and I don't want you to use that piece of vision for what I'm going to ask you to do. Fine. Now, I'd like you to reach out with your right hand [and] point to what I'm holding." Mr. J. then replied, "But I don't see anything—I'm blind!" The doctor then said, "I know, but please try, anyway." Mr. J then shrugged and pointed, and was surprised when his finger encountered the end of the cane which the doctor was pointing toward him. After this, Mr. J. said that "it was just luck". The doctor then turned the cane around so that the handle side was pointing towards Mr. J. He then asked for Mr. J. to grab hold of the cane. Mr. J. reached out with an open hand and grabbed hold of the cane. After this, the doctor said, "Good. Now put your hand down, please." The doctor then rotated the cane 90 degrees, so that the handle was oriented vertically. The doctor then asked Mr. J. to reach for the cane again. Mr. J. did this, and he turned his wrist so that his hand matched the orientation of the handle. This case study shows that—although (on a conscious level) Mr. J. was completely unaware of any visual abilities that he may have had—he was able to orient his grabbing motions as if he had no visual impairments.&lt;ref name="Carlson 2013 4" /&gt;

== Brain regions involved ==
{{Medref|section|reason=only final sentence appears to be inline referenced|date=August 2015}}Visual processing in the brain goes through a series of stages. Destruction of the primary visual cortex leads to blindness in the part of the visual field that corresponds to the damaged cortical representation. The area of blindness – known as a scotoma – is in the visual field opposite the damaged hemisphere and can vary from a small area up to the entire hemifield. Visual processing occurs in the brain in a hierarchical series of stages (with much [[Crosstalk (biology)|crosstalk]] and feedback between areas). The route from the [[retina]] through V1 is not the only visual pathway into the cortex, though it is by far the largest; it is commonly thought that the residual performance of people exhibiting blindsight is due to preserved pathways into the extrastriate cortex that bypass V1. What is surprising is that activity in these extrastriate areas is apparently insufficient to support visual awareness in the absence of V1.

To put it in a more complex way, recent physiological findings suggest that [[visual processing]] takes place along several independent, parallel pathways. One system processes information about shape, one about color, and one about movement, location and spatial organization. This information moves through an area of the brain called the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]], located in the [[thalamus]], and on to be processed in the primary visual cortex, area V1 (also known as the [[striate cortex]] because of its striped appearance). People with damage to V1 report no conscious vision, no visual imagery, and no visual images in their dreams. However, some of these people still experience the blindsight phenomenon,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; though this too is controversial, with some studies showing a limited amount of consciousness without V1 or projections relating to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ffytche|first=Dominic H.|last2=Zeki|first2=Semir|date=2011-01-01|title=The primary visual cortex, and feedback to it, are not necessary for conscious vision|journal=Brain|language=en|volume=134|issue=1|pages=247–257|doi=10.1093/brain/awq305|issn=0006-8950|via=|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The superior colliculus and prefrontal cortex also have a major role in awareness of a visual stimulus.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hall N. J.|first=|author2=Colby C. L.|date=|year=2009|title=Response to blue visual stimuli in the macaque superior colliculus|url=|journal=Society for Neuroscience|volume=19|issue=|pages=520–533|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lateral geniculate nucleus ===
{{Synthesis|section|talksection=Causation of blindsight|date=January 2014}}
[[Mosby's Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing &amp; Health Professions]] defines the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) as "one of two elevations of the lateral posterior thalamus receiving visual impulses from the retina via the optic nerves and tracts and relaying the impulses to the calcarine (visual) cortex".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=[[Mosby's Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing &amp; Health Professions]]|last=|first=|date=2009|publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|others=Mosby, Inc.|year=|isbn=9780323049375|edition=8th|location=St. Louis, Missouri|pages=|oclc=226911727}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the [[Magnocellular pathway|magnocellular system]] of the LGN is less affected by the removal of V1, which suggests that it is because of this system in the LGN that blindsight occurs.&lt;ref name="Schmid, M. Mrowka 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Schmid F. Leopold|author2=Mrowka M.|author3=Turchi S.|author4=Saunders J.|author5=Wilke R.|author6=Peters M.|author7=Ye A.|year=2010|title=Blindsight Depends on the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus|journal=Nature|volume=466|issue=|pages=373–376|doi=10.1038/nature09179|pmc=2904843|pmid=20574422}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LGN is made up of 6 layers, including layers 1 &amp; 2, which are part of the magnocellular layers. The cells in these layers behave like that of M-retinal ganglion cells, are most sensitive to movement of visual stimuli and have large centre-surround [[receptive fields]].&lt;ref name="neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nba.uth.tmc.edu/neuroscience/s2/chapter15.html|title=Chapter 15: Visual Processing: Cortical Pathways|last=Dragoi|first=Valentin|date=1997|work=Neuroscience Online|publisher=The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  M-retinal ganglion cells project to the magnocellular layers.&lt;ref name="neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu" /&gt;

What is seen in the left and right visual field is taken in by each eye and brought back to the optic disc via the nerve fibres of the retina.&lt;ref name="neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu" /&gt; From the optic disc, visual information travels through the optic nerve and into the [[optic chiasm]]. Visual information then enters the optic tract and travels to four different areas of the brain including the LGN, [[superior colliculus]], [[pretectum]] of the mid brain, and suprachiasmatic nucleus of the [[hypothalamus]]. Most axons from the LGN will then travel to the primary visual cortex.&lt;ref name="neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu" /&gt;

[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] was employed to conduct brain scans in normal, healthy human volunteers to attempt to demonstrate that visual motion can bypass V1, through a connection from the LGN to the human middle temporal complex.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gaglianese E.

In a study conducted in primates, after partial [[ablation]] of area V1, areas V2 and V3 were still excited by visual stimulus.&lt;ref name="cns.nyu.edu" /&gt; Other evidence suggests that "the LGN projections that survive V1 removal are relatively sparse in density, but are nevertheless widespread and probably encompass all extrastriate visual areas," including V2, V4, V5 and the inferotemporal cortex region.&lt;ref name="Weiskrantz, L. 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Weiskrantz L|year=1996|title=Blindsight Revisited|url=|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|volume=6|issue=|pages=215–220|doi=10.1016/s0959-4388(96)80075-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Injury to the primary visual cortex, including lesions and other trauma, leads to the loss of visual experience.&lt;ref name="Schmid, M. Mrowka 2010" /&gt; However, the residual vision that is left cannot be attributed to V1. According to the study done by Schmid et al., "thalamic lateral geniculate nucleus has a causal role in V1-independent processing of visual information". This information was found through experiments using fMRI during activation and inactivation of the LGN and the contribution the LGN has on visual experience in monkeys with a V1 lesion. Furthermore, once the LGN was inactivated, virtually all of the extrastriate areas of the brain no longer showed a response on the fMRI.&lt;ref name="Schmid, M. Mrowka 2010" /&gt; The information leads to a qualitative assessment that included "scotoma stimulation, with the LGN intact had fMRI activation of ~20% of that under normal conditions".&lt;ref name="Schmid, M. Mrowka 2010" /&gt; This finding agrees with the information obtained from, and fMRI images of, patients with blindsight.&lt;ref name="Schmid, M. Mrowka 2010" /&gt;

These findings run parallel with the theory that the LGN is what actually houses this residual vision upon damage of the VI. Also from the same study &lt;ref name="Schmid, M. Mrowka 2010" /&gt; patient GY presented with blindsight. After research, it was discovered that the LGN is less affected by a V1 injury as many neurons are still reacting to lower-visual field stimulation.&lt;ref name="Schmid, M. Mrowka 2010" /&gt; All residual vision was lost, however, when there is injury to the LGN.&lt;ref name="Schmid, M. Mrowka 2010" /&gt; This further supports the idea that when the LGN is preserved upon injury of V1, it is what encompasses the "sight" portion of blindsight.

The LGN plays a major role in blindsight.&lt;ref name="Schmid, M. Mrowka 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cns.nyu.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiskrantz, L. 1996" /&gt; Although injury to V1 does create a loss of vision, the LGN is credited for the residual vision that remains, substantiating the word "sight" in blindsight. The LGN has the ability to bypass V1 and still communicate to the extrastriate areas of the brain, creating the response to visual stimuli that we see in blindsight patients.&lt;ref name="Schmid, M. Mrowka 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cns.nyu.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiskrantz, L. 1996" /&gt; Using the proper techniques such as fMRI and other indirect methodologies, blindsight can be attributed to V1 damage and a functioning LGN.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6583">'''Creode''' or '''chreod''' is a [[neologism|neologistic]] [[portmanteau]] term coined by the English 20th century biologist [[C.H. Waddington]] to represent the developmental pathway followed by a [[cell (biology)|cell]] as it grows to form part of a specialized organ.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington,  pp 19–30&lt;/ref&gt;  Combining the Greek roots for "necessary" and "path," the term was inspired by the property of [[biology|regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, p 32&lt;/ref&gt;  When [[biology|development]] is disturbed by external forces, the embryo attempts to regulate its growth and differentiation by returning to its normal developmental trajectory.

==Developmental biology==

Waddington used the term along with [[canalisation (genetics)|canalisation]] and [[homeorhesis]], which describes a system that returns to a steady trajectory, in contrast to [[homeostasis]], which describes a system which returns to a steady state. Waddington explains development with the metaphor of a ball rolling down a hillside, where the hill's contours channel the ball in a particular direction. In the case of a pathway or creode which is deeply carved in the hillside, external disturbance is unlikely to prevent normal development. He notes that creodes tend to have steeper sides earlier in development, when external disturbance rarely suffices to alter the developmental trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, p 23&lt;/ref&gt; Small differences in placement atop the hill can lead to dramatically different results by the time the ball reaches the bottom. This represents the tendency of neighboring regions of the early embryo to develop into different organs with radically different structures.  Since intermediate structures rarely exist between organs, each ball that rolls down the hill is "[[canalisation (genetics)|canalised]]" to a region distinct from other regions, just as an eye, for instance, is distinct from an ear.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, p 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddington refers to the network of creodes carved into the hillside as an "[[epigenetic]] landscape," meaning that the formation of the body depends on not only its [[Genetics|genetic]] makeup but the different ways genes are expressed in different regions of the embryo.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, pp 30–33&lt;/ref&gt;  He expands his metaphor by describing the underside of the epigenetic landscape.  Here we see that the "landscape" is really more like a giant sheet that would blow away except that a series of tension-bearing cables holds it down.  The pegs that connect the cables to the ground are the genes.  The cables themselves are the epigenetic factors that influence gene expression in various regions of the embryo.  The depth and direction of the channels is thus determined by a combination of genetic makeup and the epigenetic [[feedback loops]] by which genes are regulated.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, pp 34–37&lt;/ref&gt;

While Waddington does assert that the process of development is genetically driven, he makes no attempt to explain how this works and even offers evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, p 37&lt;/ref&gt;  He observes, for instance, that genes ordinarily determine peripheral traits, such as eye color, rather than "focal" traits, such as the structure of the eye itself.  Moreover, when genetic mutation influences basic structures, the result tends to be the complete transformation of a structure into another rather than piecemeal change, which Waddington illustrates with the developmental ball rolling out of one creode into another.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, pp 51-52&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus his account gives the impression that genes influence development, perhaps altering the course of a region of cells, without determining the endpoints toward which the embryo develops.

This interpretation is further reinforced by Waddington's discussion of the organization of the gene pool, where he points out that "the epigenetic process occurring during the development of the organism might be so buffered or canalized that the optimum end-result is produced irrespective of the genes which the individual contains."&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, p 120&lt;/ref&gt;  The more deeply creodes are carved into the epigenetic landscape, the weaker the influence of genes over development.  He also argues that deep creodes will resist not only genetic but environmental pressures to change course.  This phenomenon, which he calls "stabilizing selection," puts genes and environment on a par in secondary importance compared to the epigenetic system.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, p 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddington's emphasis on epigenetics over genes prefigured the current interest in [[evolutionary developmental biology]].  As [[Sean B. Carroll]] and others have explained, genes involved in development are roughly the same in all animal species, from insect to primate.  Instead of mutations in developmental genes, evolution has been driven by changes in gene expression, namely which genes are expressed at which times and locations in the developing organism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sean B Carroll]], ''Endless Forms Most Beautiful'', WW Norton &amp; Company, 2005, pp 9, 64–71&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

Architectural theorist [[Sanford Kwinter]] described the concept of the chreod as "the most important concept of the 20th century."&lt;ref&gt;Sandford Kwinter, "Lecture Excerpt: What Is Life?," ''GSD 08 Platform,'' Harvard University Graduate School of Design, page 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "chreod" also closely describes paths of decision within what [[Christopher Alexander]] has called [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], his term for what he notes that Stuart Kaufmann calls "fitness landscape." By Alexander's theory, because conscious human design decisions do not need to follow these chreods, conscious human design can lead to mixed results. Therefore, he proposes that discovering ways to allow architecture to follow these paths is the best way to get good results in the built environment. Alexander sees his theories of "The Fundamental Process", "structure preserving transformations" and "15 fundamental properties" which he outlines in his work ''[[The Nature of Order]]'' as instrumentally shaping paths through configuration space.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Alexander]], [http://www.katarxis3.com/SCIENTIFIC%20INTRODUCTION.pdf ''New Concepts in Complexity Theory Arising from Studies in the Field of Architecture''], p 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Eco''RI''' (pronounced "eco R one") is a restriction [[endonuclease]] enzyme isolated from species ''[[E. coli]].'' The ''Eco'' part of the enzyme's name originates from the species from which it was isolated, while the R represents the particular strain, in this case RY13. The last part of its name, the I, denotes that it was the first enzyme isolated from this strain. ''Eco''RI is a restriction enzyme that cleaves DNA double helices into fragments at specific sites. It is also a part of the [[restriction modification system]].

In [[molecular biology]] it is used as a [[restriction enzyme]]. ''Eco''RI creates 4 nucleotide [[DNA end|sticky ends]] with [[5' end]] overhangs of AATT. The nucleic acid recognition sequence where the enzyme cuts is G/AATTC, which has a [[Palindrome|palindromic]], complementary sequence of CTTAA/G. The / in the sequence indicates which phosphodiester bond the enzyme will break in the DNA molecule. Other restriction enzymes, depending on their cut sites, can also leave 3' overhangs or blunt ends with no overhangs.

== Structure ==

=== Primary structure ===
''Eco''RI contains the PD..D/EXK motif within its active site like many [[Restriction enzyme|restriction endonucleases]].

=== Tertiary and quaternary structure ===
The enzyme is a [[homodimer]] of a 31 kilodalton subunit consisting of one globular domain of the α/β architecture. Each subunit contains a loop which sticks out from the globular domain and wraps around the DNA when bound.&lt;ref name="Pingoud"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pingoud A, Jeltsch A | title = Structure and function of type II restriction endonucleases | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 29 | issue = 18 | pages = 3705–27 | date = September 2001 | pmid = 11557805 | pmc = 55916 | doi = 10.1093/nar/29.18.3705 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurpiewski"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurpiewski MR, Engler LE, Wozniak LA, Kobylanska A, Koziolkiewicz M, Stec WJ, Jen-Jacobson L | title = Mechanisms of coupling between DNA recognition specificity and catalysis in EcoRI endonuclease | journal = Structure | volume = 12 | issue = 10 | pages = 1775–88 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15458627 | doi = 10.1016/j.str.2004.07.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Eco''RI has been cocrystallized with the sequence it normally cuts. This crystal was used to solve the structure of the complex {{PDB2|1QPS}}. The solved crystal structure shows that the subunits of the enzyme [[homodimer]] interact with the DNA symmetrically.&lt;ref name="Pingoud" /&gt; In the complex, two [[Alpha helix|α-helices]] from each subunit come together to form a four-helix bundle.&lt;ref name="Bitinaite"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bitinaite J, Wah DA, Aggarwal AK, Schildkraut I | title = FokI dimerization is required for DNA cleavage | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 18 | pages = 10570–5 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9724744 | pmc = 27935 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.18.10570 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the interacting helices are residues Glu144 and Arg145, which interact together, forming a crosstalk ring that is believed to allow the enzyme's two active sites to communicate.&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim YC, Grable JC, Love R, Greene PJ, Rosenberg JM | title = Refinement of Eco RI endonuclease crystal structure: a revised protein chain tracing | journal = Science | volume = 249 | issue = 4974 | pages = 1307–9 | date = September 1990 | pmid = 2399465 | doi = 10.1126/science.2399465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

Restriction enzymes, such as ''Eco''RI, are used in a wide variety of molecular genetics techniques including [[Clone (genetics)|cloning]], DNA screening and deleting sections of DNA ''in vitro''. Restriction enzymes, like ''Eco''RI, that generate [[Sticky and blunt ends|sticky ends]] of DNA are often used to cut DNA prior to [[DNA ligase|ligation]], as the sticky ends make the [[DNA ligase|ligation reaction]] more efficient. ''Eco''RI can exhibit non-site-specific cutting, known as [[star activity]], depending on the conditions present in the reaction. Conditions that can induce star activity when using ''Eco''RI include low salt concentration, high glycerol concentration, excessive amounts of enzyme present in the reaction, high pH and contamination with certain organic solvents. The cut made by the Eco RI enzyme produces sticky ends on the vector mainly plasmids or viral DNA's. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/faqproductR0101.asp#1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Educational psychology''' is the branch of [[psychology]] concerned with the scientific study of human [[learning]]. The study of learning processes, from both [[cognitive]] and [[behavioral]] perspectives, allows researchers to understand individual differences in [[intelligence]], [[cognitive]] development, affect, [[motivation]], self-regulation, and self-concept, as well as their role in learning. The field of educational psychology relies heavily on quantitative methods, including testing and measurement, to enhance educational activities related to instructional design, classroom management, and assessment, which serve to facilitate learning processes in various educational settings across the lifespan.&lt;ref name=Snowman&gt;Snowman, Jack (1997). Educational Psychology: What Do We Teach, What Should We Teach?. "Educational Psychology", 9, 151-169&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by [[psychology]], bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between [[medicine]] and [[biology]]. It is also informed by [[neuroscience]]. Educational psychology in turn informs a wide range of specialities within educational studies, including [[instructional design]], [[educational technology]], curriculum development, [[organizational learning]], [[special education]], [[classroom management]], and student motivation. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to [[cognitive science]] and the [[learning sciences]]. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks.&lt;ref name=lucas&gt;Lucas, J.L.; Blazek, M.A. &amp; Riley, A.B. (2005). The lack of representation of educational psychology and school psychology in introductory psychology textbooks. ''Educational Psychology'', 25, 347–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of educational psychology involves the study of [[memory]], conceptual processes, and individual differences (via cognitive psychology) in conceptualizing new strategies for learning processes in humans. Educational psychology has been built upon theories of [[operant conditioning]], [[Functional psychology|functionalism]], [[structuralism (psychology)|structuralism]], [[constructivism (psychological school)|constructivism]], [[humanistic psychology]], [[Gestalt psychology]], and [[information processing]].&lt;ref name="Snowman"/&gt;

Educational psychology has seen rapid growth and development as a profession in the last twenty years.&lt;ref name=Farrell&gt;Farrell, P. (2010). School psychology: Learning lessons from history and moving forward. School Psychology International, 31(6), 581-598.&lt;/ref&gt; [[School psychology]] began with the concept of intelligence testing leading to provisions for special education students, who could not follow the regular classroom curriculum in the early part of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Farrell"/&gt; However, "school psychology" itself has built a fairly new profession based upon the practices and theories of several psychologists among many different fields. Educational psychologists are working side by side with psychiatrists, social workers, teachers, speech and language therapists, and counselors in attempt to understand the questions being raised when combining behavioral, cognitive, and social psychology in the classroom setting.&lt;ref name="Farrell"/&gt;

==History==

===Early years===
Educational psychology is a fairly new and growing field of study. Though it can date back as early as the days of Plato and Aristotle, it was not identified as a specific practice. It was unknown that everyday teaching and learning in which individuals had to think about individual differences, assessment, development, the nature of a subject being taught, problem solving, and transfer of learning was the beginning to the field of educational psychology. These topics are important to education and as a result it is important to understanding human cognition, learning, and social perception.&lt;ref name="Berliner"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berliner|first=David|title=The 100-Year Journey Of Educational Psychology|url=http://www.wou.edu/~girodm/611/Berliner_100years.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plato and Aristotle====

Educational [[psychology]] dates back to the time of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]. [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] researched individual differences in the field of [[education]], training of the body and the cultivation of psycho-motor skills, the formation of good character, the possibilities and limits of moral [[education]]. Some other educational topics they spoke about were the effects of music, poetry, and the other arts on the development of individual, role of teacher, and the relations between teacher and student.&lt;ref name="Berliner"/&gt;  Plato saw knowledge as an innate ability, which  evolves through experience and understanding of the world. Such a statement has evolved into a continuing argument of [[nature]] vs. nurture in understanding conditioning and learning today. [[Aristotle]] observed the phenomenon of "association." His four laws of association included succession, contiguity, similarity, and contrast. His studies examined recall and facilitated learning processes.&lt;ref name=Lott&gt;[[Toomas Lott]] (2011). "Plato on the Rationality of Belief, Trames", 15, 339-364.&lt;/ref&gt;

====John Locke====

[[John Locke]] was considered one of the most influential philosophers in post-renaissance Europe in about mid 1600s. Locke was called "Father of English Psychology". One of Locke's most important works was written in 1690, named ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''. In this essay, he introduced the term "tabula rasa" meaning "blank slate." Locke explained that learning was primarily understood through experience only, and we were all born without knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.niu.edu/acad/psych/Millis/History/2003/locke.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He followed by contrasting Plato's theory of innate learning processes. Locke believed the mind was formed by experiences, not innate ideas. Locke introduced this idea as "empiricism," or the understanding that knowledge is only built on knowledge and experience.

In the late 1600s, John Locke advanced the hypothesis that people learn primarily from external forces.  He believed that the mind was like a blank tablet (tabula rasa), and that successions of simple impressions give rise to complex ideas through association and reflection.  Locke is credited with establishing "[[empiricism]]" as a criterion for testing the validity of knowledge, thus providing a conceptual framework for later development of experimental methodology in the natural and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/history.html|title=The History of Educational Psychology|last=|first=|date=|website=cortland.edu|publisher=|access-date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Before 1890===
Philosophers of education such as Juan Vives, Johann Pestalozzi, Friedrich Fröbel, and Johann Herbart had examined, classified and judged the methods of education centuries before the beginnings of psychology in the late 1800s.

====Juan Vives====

[[Juan Vives]] (1493–1540) proposed induction as the method of study and believed in the direct [[observation]] and investigation of the study of [[nature]]. His studies focus of humanistic [[learning]], which opposed scholasticism and was influenced by a variety of sources including [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[politics]], [[religion]], and [[history]].&lt;ref name=zimmerman2&gt;[[Barry Zimmerman|Zimmerman, B.J.]] &amp; [[Dale Schunk|Schunk, D.H.]] (Eds.) (2003). ''Educational psychology: A century of contributions''. Mahwah, NJ, US: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first to emphasize that the location of the school is important to [[learning]].&lt;ref name=vives&gt;Vives, J, &amp; Watson, F. (1913). On education : a translation of the de tradendis disciplinis of juan luis vives . Cambridge : The University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that the school should be located away from disturbing noises; the air quality should be good and there should be plenty of food for the students and teachers.&lt;ref name="vives"/&gt; Vives emphasized the importance of understanding individual differences of the students and suggested practice as an important tool for learning.&lt;ref name="vives"/&gt;

Vives introduced his educational ideas in his writing, "De anima et vita" in 1538. In this publication, Vives explores moral [[philosophy]] as a setting for his educational ideals; with this, he explains that the different parts of the soul (similar to that of Aristotle's ideas) are each responsible for different operations, which function distinctively. The first book covers the different "souls": "The Vegatative Soul;" this is the soul of [[nutrition]], growth, and reproduction, "The Sensitive Soul," which involves the five external senses; "The Cogitative soul," which includes internal senses and [[cognitive]] facilities. The second book involves functions of the rational soul: mind, will, and memory. Lastly, the third book explains the analysis of emotions.&lt;ref name=Casini&gt;[[Casini, Lorenzo]] (2010). "Quid sit anima": Juan Luis Vives on the soul and its relation to the body". Renaissance Studies, 24, 496- 517&lt;/ref&gt;

====Johann Pestalozzi====

[[Johann Pestalozzi]] (1746–1827), a Swiss educational reformer, emphasized the child rather than the content of the school.&lt;ref name=glover&gt;Glover, J, &amp; Ronning, R. (Ed.). (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Pestalozzi fostered an educational reform backed by the idea that early education was crucial for children, and could be manageable for mothers. Eventually, this experience with early education would lead to a "wholesome person characterized by morality."&lt;ref name=Horlacher&gt;Horlacher, Rebekka (2011). Schooling as a means of popular education: Pestalozzi's method as a popular education experiment. "Paedagogica Historica": 47, 65-75&lt;/ref&gt; Pestalozzi has been acknowledged for opening institutions for education, writing books for mother's teaching home education, and elementary books for students, mostly focusing on the kindergarten level. In his later years, he published teaching manuals and methods of teaching.&lt;ref name=Horlacher/&gt;

During the time of [[The Enlightenment]], Pestalozzi's ideals introduced "educationalisation." This created the bridge between social issues and education by introducing the idea of social issues to be solved through education. Horlacher describes the most prominent example of this during The Enlightenment to be "improving agricultural production methods."&lt;ref name=Horlacher/&gt;

====Johann Herbart====

Johann Herbart (1776–1841) is considered the father of educational [[psychology]].&lt;ref name=hergenhahn&gt;Hergenhahn, B.R. (2009). An introduction to the history of psychology. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;  He believed that [[learning]] was influenced by interest in the subject and the teacher.&lt;ref name="hergenhahn"/&gt; He thought that teachers should consider the students' existing mental sets—what they already know—when presenting new information or material.&lt;ref name="hergenhahn"/&gt; Herbart came up with what are now known as the formal steps. The 5 steps that teachers should use are:

# Review material that has already been learned by the student&lt;ref name="hergenhahn"/&gt;
# Prepare the student for new material by giving them an overview of what they are learning next&lt;ref name="hergenhahn"/&gt;
# Present the new material.&lt;ref name="hergenhahn"/&gt;
# Relate the new material to the old material that has already been learned.&lt;ref name="hergenhahn"/&gt;
# Show how the student can apply the new material and show the material they will learn next.&lt;ref name="hergenhahn"/&gt;

===1890–1920===
There were three major figures in educational psychology in this period: William James, G. Stanley Hall, and John Dewey. These three men distinguished themselves in general psychology and educational psychology, which overlapped significantly at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berliner|first=David|title=The 100- Year Journey of Educational Psychology|url=http://www.wou.edu/~girodm/611/Berliner_100years.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====William James (1842–1910)====

[[File:William James, philosopher.jpg|thumb|upright|William James]]
The period of 1890–1920 is considered the golden era of educational psychology where aspirations of the new discipline rested on the application of the scientific methods of observation and experimentation to educational problems. From 1840 to 1920 37 million people immigrated to the United States.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; This created an expansion of elementary schools and secondary schools. The increase in immigration also provided educational psychologists the opportunity to use intelligence testing to screen immigrants at Ellis Island.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; [[Darwinism]] influenced the beliefs of the prominent educational psychologists.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; Even in the earliest years of the discipline, educational psychologists recognized the limitations of this new approach. The pioneering American psychologist [[William James]] commented that: 
{{quote|Psychology is a science, and teaching is an art; and sciences never generate arts directly out of themselves. An intermediate inventive mind must make that application, by using its originality".&lt;ref name=james&gt;[[William James|James, W.]] (1983). ''Talks to teachers on psychology and to students on some of life's ideals''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. (Original work published 1899)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
James is the father of psychology in America but he also made contributions to educational psychology.  In his famous series of lectures ''Talks to Teachers on Psychology'', published in 1899, James defines education as "the organization of acquired habits of conduct and tendencies to behavior".&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;  He states that teachers should "train the pupil to behavior"&lt;ref name="james"/&gt; so that he fits into the social and physical world. Teachers should also realize the importance of habit and instinct. They should present information that is clear and interesting and relate this new information and material to things the student already knows about.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt; He also addresses important issues such as attention, memory, and association of ideas.

====Alfred Binet====

[[Alfred Binet]] published ''Mental Fatigue'' in 1898, in which he attempted to apply the experimental method to educational psychology.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;  In this experimental method he advocated for two types of experiments, experiments done in the lab and experiments done in the classroom.  In 1904 he was appointed the Minister of Public Education.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; This is when he began to look for a way to distinguish children with developmental disabilities.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; Binet strongly supported special education programs because he believed that "abnormality" could be cured.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;  The Binet-Simon test was the first intelligence test and was the first to distinguish between  "normal children" and those with developmental disabilities.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;  Binet believed that it was important to study individual differences between age groups and children of the same age.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; He also believed that it was important for teachers to take into account individual students strengths and also the needs of the classroom as a whole when teaching and creating a good learning environment.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; He also believed that it was important to train teachers in observation so that they would be able to see individual differences among children and adjust the curriculum to the students.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; Binet also emphasized that practice of material was important.  In 1916 [[Lewis Terman]] revised the Binet-Simon so that the average score was always 100.&lt;ref name="hergenhahn"/&gt; The test became known as the Stanford-Binet and was one of the most widely used tests of intelligence.  Terman, unlike Binet, was interested in using intelligence test to identify gifted children who had high intelligence.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; In his longitudinal study of gifted children, who became known as the Termites, Terman found that gifted children become gifted adults.&lt;ref name="hergenhahn"/&gt;

====Edward Thorndike====

[[Edward Thorndike]] (1874–1949) supported the scientific movement in education. He based teaching practices on empirical evidence and measurement.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; Thorndike developed the theory of [[instrumental conditioning]] or the law of effect.   The law of effect states that associations are strengthened when it is followed by something pleasing and associations are weakened when followed by something not pleasing. He also found that [[learning]] is done a little at a time or in increments, [[learning]] is an automatic process and all the principles of [[learning]] apply to all mammals. Thorndike's research with [[Robert Woodworth]] on the theory of transfer found that learning one subject will only influence your ability to [[learn]] another subject if the subjects are similar.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; This discovery led to less emphasis on learning the [[classics]] because they found that studying the classics does not contribute to overall general intelligence.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; Thorndike was one of the first to say that individual differences in [[cognitive]] tasks were due to how many stimulus response patterns a person had rather than a general intellectual ability.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;  He contributed word dictionaries that were [[scientifically]] based to determine the words and definitions used.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; The dictionaries were the first to take into consideration the users maturity level.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;  He also integrated pictures and easier pronunciation guide into each of the definitions.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; Thorndike contributed [[arithmetic]] books based on [[learning theory (education)|learning theory]]. He made all the problems more realistic and relevant to what was being studied, not just to improve the general [[intelligence]].&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; He developed tests that were standardized to measure performance in school related subjects.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; His biggest contribution to testing was the CAVD intelligence test which used a multidimensional approach to intelligence and the first to use a ratio scale.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; His later work was on programmed instruction, mastery learning and computer-based learning:
{{quote|If, by a miracle of mechanical ingenuity, a book could be so arranged that only to him who had done what was directed on page one would page two become visible, and so on, much that now requires personal instruction could be managed by print.&lt;ref name=thorndike&gt;[[Edward Thorndike|Thorndike, E.L.]] (1912). ''Education: A first book''. New York: MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====John Dewey====

[[John Dewey]] (1859–1952) had a major influence on the development of [[progressive education]] in the United States. He believed that the classroom should prepare children to be good citizens and facilitate creative intelligence.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; He pushed for the creation of practical classes that could be applied outside of a school setting.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; He also thought that education should be student-oriented, not subject-oriented. For Dewey, education was a social experience that helped bring together generations of people. He stated that students learn by doing. He believed in an active mind that was able to be educated through observation, problem solving and enquiry. In his 1910 book ''How We Think'', he emphasizes that material should be provided in a way that is stimulating and interesting to the student since it encourages original thought and problem solving.&lt;ref name=Dewey&gt;Dewey J. (1910). How we think. New York  D.C. Heath &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also stated that material should be relative to the student's own experience.&lt;ref name="Dewey"/&gt;
{{quote|"The material furnished by way of information should be relevant to a question that is vital in the students own experience"&lt;ref name="Dewey"/&gt;}}

====Jean Piaget====

[[Jean Piaget]] (1896–1980) was one of the most powerful researchers in the area of developmental psychology during the 20th century. He developed the theory of [[cognitive]] development.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; The [[theory]] stated that intelligence developed in four different stages. The stages are the sensorimotor stage from birth to 2 years old, the preoperational state from 2 years old to 7 years old, the concrete operational stage from 7 years old to 10 years old, and formal operational stage from 11 years old and up.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; He also believed that learning was constrained to the child's cognitive development. Piaget influenced educational psychology because he was the first to believe that cognitive development was important and something that should be paid attention to in education.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;  Most of the research on Piagetian theory was carried out by American educational psychologists.

===1920–present===
The number of people receiving a high school and college education increased dramatically from 1920 to 1960.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; Because very few jobs were available to teens coming out of eighth grade, there was an increase in high school attendance in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; The progressive movement in the United State took off at this time and led to the idea of [[progressive education]]. John Flanagan, an educational psychologist, developed tests for combat trainees and instructions in combat training.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;  In 1954 the work of Kenneth Clark and his wife on the effects of segregation on black and white children was influential in the Supreme Court case [[Brown v. Board of Education]].&lt;ref name="hergenhahn"/&gt; From the 1960s to present day, educational psychology has switched from a behaviorist perspective to a more cognitive based perspective because of the influence and development of [[cognitive psychology]] at this time.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;

====Jerome Bruner====

[[Jerome Bruner]] is notable for integrating [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]'s [[cognitive]] approaches into educational [[psychology]].&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; He advocated for [[discovery learning]] where teachers create a [[problem solving]] environment that allows the student to question, [[explore]] and experiment.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; In his book ''The Process of Education'' Bruner stated that the structure of the material and the [[cognitive]] abilities of the person are important in [[learning]].&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; He emphasized the importance of the subject matter. He also believed that how the subject was structured was important for the student's understanding of the subject and it is the goal of the teacher to structure the subject in a way that was easy for the student to understand.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;  In the early 1960s Bruner went to [[Africa]] to teach math and science to school children, which influenced his view as schooling as a [[cultural]] institution.  Bruner was also influential in the development of MACOS, Man a Course of Study, which was an educational program that combined [[anthropology]] and [[science]].&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; The program explored human evolution and social behavior.  He also helped with the development of the head start program. He was interested in the influence of culture on education and looked at the impact of poverty on educational development.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;

====Benjamin Bloom====

[[Benjamin Bloom]] (1903–1999) spent over 50 years at the [[University of Chicago]], where he worked in the department of education.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; He believed that all students can learn. He developed [[taxonomy of educational objectives]].&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; The objectives were divided into three domains: cognitive, affective, and psychomotor. The cognitive domain deals with how we think.&lt;ref name=clark&gt;Clark, D. (n.d.). Bloom's taxonomy of learning domains. Retrieved from http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/hrd/bloom.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is divided into categories that are on a continuum from easiest to more complex.&lt;ref name="clark"/&gt; The categories are knowledge or recall, comprehension application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation.&lt;ref name="clark"/&gt;  The affective domain deals with emotions and has 5 categories.&lt;ref name="clark"/&gt; The categories are receiving phenomenon, responding to that phenomenon, valuing, organization, and internalizing values.&lt;ref name="clark"/&gt; The psychomotor domain deals with the development of motor skills, movement and coordination and has 7 categories, that also goes from simplest to complex.&lt;ref name="clark"/&gt; The 7 categories of the psychomotor domain are perception, set, guided response, mechanism, complex overt response, adaptation, and origination.&lt;ref name="clark"/&gt; The taxonomy provided broad educational objectives that could be used to help expand the curriculum to match the ideas in the taxonomy.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;  The taxonomy is considered to have a greater influence internationally than in the United States. Internationally, the taxonomy is used in every aspect of education from training of the teachers to the development of testing material.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; Bloom believed in communicating clear learning goals and promoting an active student. He thought that teachers should provide feedback to the students on their strengths and weaknesses.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; Bloom also did research on college students and their problem solving processes. He found that they differ in understanding the basis of the problem and the ideas in the problem. He also found that students differ in process of problem solving in their approach and attitude toward the problem.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;

====Nathaniel Gage====

[[Nathaniel Gage]] (1917 -2008) is an important figure in educational psychology as his research focused on improving teaching and understanding the processes involved in teaching.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; He edited the book ''Handbook of Research on Teaching'' (1963), which helped develop early research in teaching and educational psychology.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; Gage founded the Stanford Center for Research and Development in Teaching, which contributed research on teaching as well as influencing the education of important educational psychologists.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;

==Perspectives==

===Behavioral===
[[Applied behavior analysis]], a research-based science utilizing behavioral principles of [[operant conditioning]], is effective in a range of educational settings.&lt;ref name=Alberto&gt;Alberto, P. &amp; Troutman, A. (2003) ''Applied behavior analysis for teachers'' (6th ed.). Columbus, OH, USA: Prentice-Hall-Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, teachers can alter student behavior by systematically rewarding students who follow classroom rules with praise, stars, or tokens exchangeable for sundry items.&lt;ref name=mcgoey&gt;McGoey, K.E. &amp; DuPaul, G.J. (2000) Token reinforcement and response cost procedures: Reducing the disruptive behavior of preschool children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. ''School Psychology Quarterly'', 15, 330–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=theodore&gt;Theodore, L.A.; Bray, M.A.; Kehle, T.J. &amp; Jenson, W.R. (2001) Randomization of group contingencies and reinforcers to reduce classroom disruptive behavior. ''Journal of School Psychology'', 39, 267–77.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the demonstrated efficacy of awards in changing behavior, their use in education has been criticized by proponents of [[self-determination theory]], who claim that praise and other rewards undermine [[intrinsic motivation]]. There is evidence that tangible rewards decrease intrinsic motivation in specific situations, such as when the student already has a high level of intrinsic motivation to perform the goal behavior.&lt;ref name=lepper&gt;[[Mark Lepper|Lepper, M. R.]]; Greene, D. &amp; [[Richard E. Nisbett|Nisbett, R.E.]] (1973). Undermining children's intrinsic interest with extrinsic reward: A test of the "overjustification" hypothesis. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 28, 129–37.&lt;/ref&gt; But the results showing detrimental effects are counterbalanced by evidence that, in other situations, such as when rewards are given for attaining a gradually increasing standard of performance, rewards enhance intrinsic motivation.&lt;ref name=cameron&gt;Cameron, J.; Pierce, W.D.; Banko, K.M. &amp; Gear, A. (2005). Achievement-based rewards and intrinsic motivation: A test of cognitive mediators. ''Journal of Educational Psychology'', 97, 641–55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, W.D. &amp; Cameron, J. (2002). A summary of the effects of reward contingencies on interest and performance. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 3, 222–26. [http://www.baojournal.com ABO]&lt;/ref&gt; Many effective therapies have been based on the principles of applied behavior analysis, including [[pivotal response therapy]] which is used to treat autism spectrum disorders.

===Cognitive===
Among current educational psychologists, the cognitive perspective is more widely held than the behavioral perspective, perhaps because it admits causally related mental constructs such as [[trait theory|traits]], [[beliefs]], [[memories]], [[motivation]]s and [[emotion]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Cognitive theories claim that memory structures determine how information is [[perceive]]d, [[information processing|processed]], stored, [[information retrieval|retrieved]] and [[forgot]]ten. Among the memory structures theorized by cognitive psychologists are separate but linked visual and verbal systems described by [[Allan Paivio]]'s [[dual coding theory]]. Educational psychologists have used dual coding theory and [[cognitive load]] theory to explain how people learn from [[multimedia]] presentations.&lt;ref name=Mayer&gt;[[Richard E. Mayer|Mayer, R.E.]] (2001). ''Multimedia learning''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:KrugDavisGlover1990.png|right|thumb|Three experiments reported by Krug, Davis and Glover&lt;ref name=krug&gt;Krug, D.; Davis, T.B.; Glover, J.A. (1990). Massed versus distributed repeated reading: A case of forgetting helping recall? ''Journal of Educational Psychology'', 82, 366–71.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated the advantage of delaying a 2nd reading of a text passage by one week (distributed) compared with no delay between readings (massed).]]
The spaced learning effect, a [[cognitive]] phenomenon strongly supported by psychological research, has broad applicability within [[education]].&lt;ref name=dempster&gt;Dempster, F.N. (1989). Spacing effects and their implications for theory and practice. ''[[Educational Psychology Review]]'', 1, 309–30.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, students have been found to perform better on a test of knowledge about a text passage when a second reading of the passage is delayed rather than immediate (see figure).&lt;ref name=krug/&gt; Educational psychology research has confirmed the applicability to education of other findings from cognitive psychology, such as the benefits of using [[mnemonics]] for immediate and delayed retention of information.&lt;ref name=carney&gt;Carney, R.N. &amp; Levin, J.R. (2000). Fading mnemonic memories: Here's looking anew, again!  ''[[Contemporary Educational Psychology]]'', 25, 499–508.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Problem solving]], according to prominent cognitive psychologists, is fundamental to [[learning]]. It resides as an important research topic in educational psychology. A student is thought to interpret a problem by assigning it to a [[schema (psychology)|schema]] retrieved from long-term memory. A problem students run into while reading is called "activation." This is when the student's representations of the text are present during working memory. This causes the student to read through the material without absorbing the information and being able to retain it. When working memory is absent from the reader's representations of the working memory they experience something called "deactivation." When deactivation occurs, the student has an understanding of the material and is able to retain information. If deactivation occurs during the first reading, the reader does not need to undergo deactivation in the second reading. The reader will only need to reread to get a "gist" of the text to spark their [[memory]]. When the problem is assigned to the wrong schema, the student's attention is subsequently directed away from features of the problem that are inconsistent with the assigned schema.&lt;ref name=kalyuga&gt;Kalyuga, S.; Chandler, P.; Tuovinen, J. &amp; [[John Sweller|Sweller, J.]] (2001). When problem solving is superior to studying worked examples. ''Journal of Educational Psychology'', 93, 579–88.&lt;/ref&gt; The critical step of finding a mapping between the problem and a pre-existing schema is often cited as supporting the centrality of [[analogical]] thinking to problem solving.

====Cognitive view of intelligence====
[[File:Figural Relationships.svg|right|thumb|An example of an item from a cognitive abilities test]]
Each person has an individual profile of characteristics, abilities and challenges that result from predisposition, learning and development. These manifest as individual differences in [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], [[creativity]], [[cognitive style]], [[motivation]] and the capacity to process information, communicate, and relate to others. The most prevalent disabilities found among school age children are [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[learning disability]], [[dyslexia]], and [[speech disorder]]. Less common disabilities include [[intellectual disability]], [[hearing impairment]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[epilepsy]], and [[blindness]].&lt;ref name=woolfolk/&gt;

Although theories of [[intelligence]] have been discussed by philosophers since [[Plato]], intelligence testing is an invention of educational psychology, and is coincident with the development of that discipline. Continuing debates about the nature of intelligence revolve on whether [[intelligence]] can be characterized by a single [[factor analysis|factor]] known as [[general intelligence factor|general intelligence]],&lt;ref name=spearman1904&gt;Spearman, C. (1904) "General intelligence" objectively determined and measured. ''American Journal of Psychology'', 15, 201–93.&lt;/ref&gt; multiple factors (e.g., [[Howard Gardner|Gardner's]] [[theory of multiple intelligences]]&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Howard. (1983) ''Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;), or whether it can be measured at all. In practice, standardized instruments such as the [[Stanford-Binet IQ test]] and the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC]]&lt;ref&gt;Wechsler, D. (1949). ''The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children.'' New York: Psychological Corp.&lt;/ref&gt; are widely used in economically developed countries to identify children in need of individualized educational treatment. Children classified as [[gifted]] are often provided with accelerated or enriched programs. Children with identified deficits may be provided with enhanced education in specific skills such as [[phonological awareness]]. In addition to basic abilities, the individual's personality [[trait theory|traits]] are also important, with people higher in [[conscientiousness]] and [[hope]] attaining superior academic achievements, even after controlling for intelligence and past performance.&lt;ref&gt;Day, L.; Hanson, K.; Maltby, J.; Proctor, C.L. &amp; Wood, A.M. (in press). [http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/alex.wood/hope_education.pdf Hope uniquely predicts objective academic achievement above intelligence, personality, and previous academic achievement.] ''Journal of Research in Personality''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental===
{{Main|Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development}}
Developmental psychology, and especially the psychology of cognitive development, opens a special perspective for educational psychology. This is so because education and the psychology of cognitive development converge on a number of crucial assumptions. First, the psychology of cognitive development defines human cognitive competence at successive phases of development. Education aims to help students acquire knowledge and develop skills which are compatible with their understanding and problem-solving capabilities at different ages. Thus, knowing the students' level on a developmental sequence provides information on the kind and level of knowledge they can assimilate, which, in turn, can be used as a frame for organizing the subject matter to be taught at different school grades. This is the reason why [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development]] was so influential for education, especially mathematics and science education.&lt;ref&gt;Furth, H.G. &amp; Wachs, H. (1975). ''Thinking goes to school: Piaget's theory in practice''. Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In the same direction, the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]] suggest that in addition to the concerns above, sequencing of concepts and skills in teaching must take account of the processing and [[working memory]] capacities that characterize successive age levels.&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou, A. &amp; Valanides, N. (1998). A three level of theory of the developing mind: Basic principles and implications for instruction and assessment. In R.J. Sternberg &amp; W.M. Williams (Eds.), ''Intelligence, instruction, and assessment'' (pp. 149–99). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Demetriou, A. 2010"&gt;Demetriou, A.; Spanoudis, G. &amp; Mouyi, A. (2010). A Three-level Model of the Developing Mind: Functional and Neuronal Substantiation. In M. Ferrari and L. Vuletic (Eds.), ''The Developmental Relations between Mind, Brain, and Education: Essays in honor of Robbie Case''. New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Second, the psychology of [[cognitive development]] involves understanding how [[cognitive]] change takes place and recognizing the factors and processes which enable cognitive competence to develop. [[Education]] also capitalizes on [[cognitive]] change, because the construction of knowledge presupposes effective teaching methods that would move the student from a lower to a higher level of understanding. Mechanisms such as reflection on actual or [[Mind|mental]] actions vis-à-vis alternative solutions to problems, tagging new concepts or solutions to symbols that help one recall and mentally manipulate them are just a few examples of how mechanisms of cognitive development may be used to facilitate learning.&lt;ref name="Demetriou, A. 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Case, R. (1985). ''Intellectual development: Birth to adulthood.'' New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the psychology of cognitive development is concerned with individual differences in the organization of cognitive processes and abilities, in their rate of change, and in their mechanisms of change. The principles underlying intra- and inter-individual differences could be educationally useful, because knowing how students differ in regard to the various dimensions of cognitive development, such as processing and representational capacity, self-understanding and self-regulation, and the various domains of understanding, such as mathematical, scientific, or verbal abilities, would enable the teacher to cater for the needs of the different students so that no one is left behind.&lt;ref name="Demetriou, A. 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Case, R. (1992). The role of central conceptual structures in the development of children's mathematical and scientific thought. In A. Demetriou, M. Shayer, &amp; A. Efklides (Eds.), ''Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development: Implications and applications to education'' (pp. 52–65). London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructivist===
{{Main|Constructivism (learning theory)|l1=Constructivism}}
Constructivism is a category of learning theory in which emphasis is placed on the agency and prior "knowing" and experience of the learner, and often on the social and cultural determinants of the learning process. Educational psychologists distinguish individual (or psychological) constructivism, identified with [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development]], from [[social constructivism (learning theory)|social constructivism]]. A dominant influence on the latter type is [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s work on sociocultural learning, describing how interactions with adults, more capable peers, and cognitive tools are internalized to form mental constructs. Elaborating on Vygotsky's theory, [[Jerome Bruner]] and other educational psychologists developed the important concept of [[instructional scaffolding]], in which the social or information environment offers supports for learning that are gradually withdrawn as they become internalized.&lt;ref name="educational psychology"&gt;Seifert, Kelvin &amp; Sutton, Rosemary. ''[http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Educational-Psychology.pdf Educational Psychology: Second Edition]''. Global Text Project, 2009, pp.&amp;nbsp;33–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jean Piaget's Cognitive Development ====
Jean Piaget was interested in how an organism adapts to its environment. Piaget hypothesized that infants are born with a schema operating at birth that he called "reflexes". Piaget  identified four stages in cognitive development. The four stages are sensorimotor stage, pre-operational stage, concrete operational stage and formal operational stage.&lt;ref name=Huitt&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huitt|first1=W|last2=Hummel |first2=J|title=Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development|journal=Educational Psychology Interactive|year=2003|url=http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/topics/cognition/piaget.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditioning and learning==

[[Image:Kugleramme.jpg|thumb|left|An [[abacus]] provides concrete experiences for learning abstract concepts.]]
To understand the characteristics of learners in [[child]]hood, [[adolescence]], [[adulthood]], and [[old age]], educational psychology develops and applies theories of human [[developmental psychology|development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/action/science/teaching-learning/index.aspx|title=Educational Psychology Promotes Teaching and Learning|website=apa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often represented as stages through which people pass as they mature, developmental theories describe changes in mental abilities ([[cognition]]), social roles, moral reasoning, and beliefs about the nature of knowledge.

For example, educational psychologists have conducted research on the instructional applicability of [[cognitive development|Jean Piaget's theory of development]], according to which children mature through four stages of cognitive capability. Piaget hypothesized that children are not capable of abstract logical thought until they are older than about 11 years, and therefore younger children need to be taught using concrete objects and examples. Researchers have found that transitions, such as from concrete to abstract logical thought, do not occur at the same time in all domains. A child may be able to think abstractly about mathematics, but remain limited to concrete thought when reasoning about human relationships. Perhaps Piaget's most enduring contribution is his insight that people actively construct their understanding through a self-regulatory process.&lt;ref name=woolfolk&gt;Woolfolk, A.E.; Winne, P.H. &amp; Perry, N.E. (2006). ''Educational Psychology'' (3rd Canadian ed.). Toronto, Canada: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

Piaget proposed a developmental theory of [[moral reasoning]] in which children progress from a naïve understanding of [[morality]] based on behavior and outcomes to a more advanced understanding based on intentions. Piaget's views of moral development were elaborated by [[Lawrence Kohlberg|Kohlberg]] into a [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stage theory of moral development]]. There is evidence that the moral reasoning described in stage theories is not sufficient to account for moral behavior. For example, other factors such as [[modeling (psychology)|modeling]] (as described by the [[social cognitive theory of morality]]) are required to explain [[bullying]].

[[Rudolf Steiner]]'s model of [[child development]] interrelates physical, emotional, cognitive, and moral development&lt;ref name="uwe.ac.uk RR645 1.5 Findings"&gt;Woods, Ashley and Woods, [http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research/data/uploadfiles/RR645.pdf ''Steiner Schools in England'', University of West of England, Bristol: Research Report RR645], section 1.5, "Findings from the survey and case studies"&lt;/ref&gt; in developmental stages similar to those later described by [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]].&lt;ref&gt;Carrie Y. Nordlund, "Art Experiences in Waldorf Education," Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Missouri-Columbia, May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Developmental theories are sometimes presented not as shifts between qualitatively different stages, but as gradual increments on separate dimensions. Development of [[epistemological]] beliefs (beliefs about knowledge) have been described in terms of gradual changes in people's belief in: certainty and permanence of knowledge, fixedness of ability, and credibility of authorities such as teachers and experts. People develop more sophisticated beliefs about knowledge as they gain in education and maturity.&lt;ref name=cano&gt;Cano, F. (2005). Epistemological beliefs and approaches to learning: Their change through secondary school and their influence on academic performance. ''British Journal of Educational Psychology'', 75, 203–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivation===
[[Motivation]] is an internal state that activates, guides and sustains behavior. Motivation can have several impacting effects on how students learn and how they behave towards subject matter:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Omrod|first=Jeanne|title=Educational Theme: Motivation in the Classroom|url=http://www.greeneeducationfoundation.org/documents/GEF_2012-2013_Educational_Theme.pdf|publisher=Green Education Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Provide direction towards goals
* Enhance cognitive processing abilities and performance
* Direct behavior toward particular goals
* Lead to increased effort and energy
* Increase initiation of and persistence in activities

Educational psychology research on motivation is concerned with the [[volition (psychology)|volition]] or [[will (philosophy)|will]] that students bring to a task, their level of interest and [[intrinsic motivation]], the personally held [[goal setting|goals]] that guide their behavior, and their belief about the causes of their success or failure. As intrinsic motivation deals with activities that act as their own rewards, extrinsic motivation deals with motivations that are brought on by consequences or punishments. A form of [[attribution theory]] developed by [[Bernard Weiner]]&lt;ref name=weiner&gt;[[Bernard Weiner|Weiner, B.]] (2000). Interpersonal and intrapersonal theories of motivation from an attributional perspective. ''Educational Psychology Review'', 12, 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; describes how students' beliefs about the causes of academic success or failure affect their emotions and motivations. For example, when students attribute failure to lack of ability, and ability is perceived as uncontrollable, they experience the emotions of [[shame]] and [[embarrassment]] and consequently decrease effort and show poorer performance. In contrast, when students attribute failure to lack of effort, and effort is perceived as controllable, they experience the emotion of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and consequently increase effort and show improved performance.&lt;ref name="weiner"/&gt;

The [[self-determination theory]] (SDT) was developed by psychologists [[Edward L. Deci|Edward Deci]] and Richard Ryan. SDT focuses on the importance of [[Motivation#Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|intrinsic and extrinsic motivation]] in driving human behavior and posits inherent growth and development tendencies. It emphasizes the degree to which an individual's behavior is self-motivated and self-determined. When applied to the realm of education, the self-determination theory is concerned primarily with promoting in students an interest in learning, a value of education, and a confidence in their own capacities and attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deci|first=Edward L.|title=Motivation and Education: The Self-Determination Perspective|journal=Educational Psychologist|year=1991|volume=26|issue=3 &amp; 4|pages=325–346|doi=10.1207/s15326985ep2603&amp;4_6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motivational theories also explain how [[goal theory|learners' goals]] affect the way they engage with academic tasks.&lt;ref name=elliot&gt;Elliot, A.J. (1999). Approach and avoidance motivation and achievement goals. ''Educational Psychologist'', 34, 169–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who have ''mastery goals'' strive to increase their ability and knowledge. Those who have ''performance approach goals'' strive for high grades and seek opportunities to demonstrate their abilities. Those who have ''performance avoidance'' goals are driven by fear of failure and avoid situations where their abilities are exposed. Research has found that mastery goals are associated with many positive outcomes such as persistence in the face of failure, preference for challenging tasks, [[creativity]] and [[intrinsic motivation]]. Performance avoidance goals are associated with negative outcomes such as poor [[attention|concentration]] while studying, disorganized studying, less self-regulation, shallow information processing and [[Anxiety (mood)#Test and performance|test anxiety]]. Performance approach goals are associated with positive outcomes, and some negative outcomes such as an unwillingness to seek help and shallow information processing.&lt;ref name="elliot"/&gt;

[[Locus of control]] is a salient factor in the successful academic performance of students. During the 1970s and '80s, [[Cassandra B. Whyte]] did significant educational research studying locus of control as related to the academic achievement of students pursuing higher education coursework. Much of her educational research and publications focused upon the theories of [[Julian B. Rotter]] in regard to the importance of internal control and successful academic performance.&lt;ref name="Whyte80"&gt;Whyte, C. (1980). An Integrated Counseling and Learning Assistance Center. New Directions Sourcebook. Jossey-Bass, Inc. San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt; Whyte reported that individuals who perceive and believe that their hard work may lead to more successful academic outcomes, instead of depending on luck or fate, persist and achieve academically at a higher level. Therefore, it is important to provide education and counseling in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, C. (1978). Effective Counseling Methods for High-Risk College Freshmen. ''Measurement and Evaluation in Guidance'', 6 (4), 198–200.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
{{broader|Educational technology}}
[[Image:BloomsCognitiveDomain.svg|right|thumb|[[Taxonomy of educational objectives|Bloom's taxonomy]] of educational objectives: categories in the cognitive domain&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;Anderson, L.W. &amp; [[David Krathwohl|Krathwohl, D.R.]] (2001). ''A taxonomy for learning, teaching, and assessing: A revision of Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives''. New York, USA: Addison-Wesley Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Instructional design]], the systematic design of materials, activities and interactive environments for learning, is broadly informed by educational psychology theories and research. For example, in defining learning goals or objectives, instructional designers often use a [[taxonomy of educational objectives]] created by [[Benjamin Bloom]] and colleagues.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt; Bloom also researched [[mastery learning]], an instructional strategy in which learners only advance to a new learning objective after they have mastered its prerequisite objectives. Bloom&lt;ref name=Bloom&gt;[[Benjamin Bloom|Bloom, B.S.]] (1984). The two sigma problem: The search for methods of group instruction as effective as one-to-one tutoring. ''Educational Researcher'', 13 (6), 4–16.&lt;/ref&gt; discovered that a combination of mastery learning with one-to-one tutoring is highly effective, producing learning outcomes far exceeding those normally achieved in classroom instruction. [[Robert M. Gagné|Gagné]], another psychologist, had earlier developed an influential method of [[task analysis]] in which a terminal learning goal is expanded into a hierarchy of learning objectives&lt;ref name=gronlund&gt;Gronlund, N.E. (2000). ''How to write and use instructional objectives'' (6th ed.). Columbus, OH, USA: Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt; connected by prerequisite relationships.
The following list of technological resources incorporate computer-aided instruction and intelligence for educational psychologists and their students: 
* [[Intelligent tutoring system]]
* [[Cognitive tutor]]
* [[Cooperative learning]]
* [[Collaborative learning]]
* [[Problem-based learning]]
* [[Computer-supported collaborative learning]]
* [[Constructive alignment]]

Technology is essential to the field of educational psychology, not only for the psychologist themselves as far as testing, organization, and resources, but also for students. Educational Psychologists whom reside in the K- 12 setting focus the majority of their time with Special Education students. It has been found that students with disabilities learning through technology such as IPad applications and videos are more engaged and motivated to learn in the classroom setting. Liu et al. explain that learning-based technology allows for students to be more focused, and learning is more efficient with learning technologies. The authors explain that learning technology also allows for students with social- emotional disabilities to participate in distance learning.&lt;ref name=Liu&gt;Liu, Gi Zen; Wu, No- Wei; Chen, Ye- Wen. Identifying Emerging Trends for implementing learning technology in special education. "Research in Development disabilities", 2013, 3618–3628&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Teaching===

[[Image:FinnGerberBoydZaharias2005.png|right|thumb|A class size experiment in the United States found that attending small classes for 3 or more years in the early grades increased high school graduation of students from low income families.&lt;ref name=finn&gt;Finn, J.D.; Gerber, S.B.; Boyd-Zaharias, J. (2005). Small classes in the early grades, academic achievement, and graduating from high school. ''Journal of Educational Psychology'', 97, 214–33.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Research on [[classroom management]] and [[pedagogy]] is conducted to guide teaching practice and form a foundation for teacher education programs. The goals of classroom management are to create an environment conducive to learning and to develop students' self-management skills. More specifically, classroom management strives to create positive teacher–student and peer relationships, manage student groups to sustain on-task behavior, and use counseling and other psychological methods to aid students who present persistent psychosocial problems.&lt;ref name=emmer&gt;Emmer, E.T. &amp; Stough, L.M. (2001). Classroom management: A critical part of educational psychology with implications for teacher education. ''Educational Psychologist'', 36, 103–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Introductory educational psychology is a commonly required area of study in most North American teacher education programs. When taught in that context, its content varies, but it typically emphasizes learning theories (especially cognitively oriented ones), issues about motivation, assessment of students' learning, and classroom management. A developing [[b:Contemporary Educational Psychology|Wikibook about educational psychology]] gives more detail about the educational psychology topics that are typically presented in preservice teacher education.

===Counseling===

====Training====
In order to become an educational psychologist, students can complete an undergraduate degree in their choice. They then must go to graduate school to study education psychology, counseling psychology, and/ or school counseling. Most students today are also receiving their doctorate degrees in order to hold the "psychologist" title. Educational psychologists work in a variety of settings. Some work in university settings where they carry out research on the cognitive and social processes of human development, learning and education. Educational psychologists may also work as consultants in designing and creating educational materials, classroom programs and online courses.Educational psychologists who work in k–12 school settings (closely related are [[school psychologist]]s in the US and Canada) are trained at the [[master's degree|master's]] and [[doctorate|doctoral]] levels. In addition to conducting assessments, school psychologists provide services such as academic and behavioral intervention, counseling, teacher consultation, and crisis intervention. However, school psychologists are generally more individual-oriented towards students.&lt;ref name= Love&gt;Love, P. (2009). Educational psychologists: the early search for an identity. Educational Psychology In Practice, 25(1), 3-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many colleges and high schools are starting to teach students how to teach students in the classroom. In colleges educational psychology is starting to be a general education requirement.

====Employment outlook====
Employment for psychologists in the United States is expected to grow faster than most occupations through the year 2014, with anticipated growth of 18–26%. One in four psychologists are employed in educational settings. In the United States, the [[median]] [[salary]] for psychologists in primary and secondary schools is US$58,360 as of May 2004.&lt;ref name=OOH&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor. ''Occupational Outlook Handbook''. 2006–07 Edition. Psychologists. retrieved from http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos056.htm on June 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Colleges offer and allow someone to obtain a PHD in educational Psychology.

In recent decades the participation of women as professional researchers in North American educational psychology has risen dramatically.&lt;ref name=evans&gt;Evans, J.; Hsieh, P.P. &amp; Robinson, D.H. (2005). Women's Involvement in educational psychology journals from 1976 to 2004. ''Educational Psychology Review'', 17, 263–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of research==
Educational psychology, as much as any other field of [[psychology]] heavily relies on a balance of pure [[observation]] and quantitative methods in [[psychology]]. The study of [[education]] generally combines the studies of [[history]], [[sociology]], and [[ethics]] with theoretical approaches. Smeyers and Depaepe explain that historically, the study of education and child rearing have been associated with the interests of policymakers and practitioners within the educational field, however, the recent shift to [[sociology]] and [[psychology]] has opened the door for new findings in education as a [[social science]]. Now being its own academic discipline, educational psychology has proven to be helpful for social science researchers.&lt;ref name=Smeyers&gt;Smeyers, Paul; Depaepe, Marc. The Lure of Psychology for Education and Educational Research. "The Journal of Educational Philosophy", (2012) 46, 315-331.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantitative research is the backing to most observable phenomena in [[psychology]]. This involves observing, creating, and understanding a distribution of data based upon the studies subject matter. Researchers use particular variables to interpret their data distributions from their research and employ statistics as a way of creating data tables and analyzing their data. [[Psychology]] has moved from the "common sense" reputations initially posed by Thomas Reid to the methodology approach comparing independent and dependent variables through natural [[observation]], [[experiment]]s, or combinations of the two. Though results are still, with statistical methods, objectively true based upon significance variables or p- values.&lt;ref name="Smeyers"/&gt;

{{Sexual orientation}}
'''Ego-dystonic sexual orientation''' is an [[ego-dystonic]] [[mental disorder]] characterized by having a [[sexual orientation]] or an attraction that is at odds with one's idealized [[self-image]], causing [[anxiety]] and a desire to change one's orientation or become more comfortable with one's sexual orientation.  It describes not innate sexual orientation itself, but a conflict between the sexual orientation one wishes to have and the sexual orientation one actually possesses.

==Classifications==
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) lists ego-dystonic sexual orientation in the [[ICD-10]], as a disorder of sexual development and orientation. The WHO diagnosis covers when gender identity or sexual orientation is clear, yet a patient has another behavioural or psychological disorder which makes that patient want to change it. {{ICD10|F|66|1|f|60}} The diagnostic manual notes that a sexual orientation is not a disorder in itself.&lt;ref name = F66note&gt;[http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf60.htm+f661 ICD-10]: See part F66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the [[American Psychological Association]] has officially opposed the category of ego-dystonic homosexuality since 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/policy/diagnoses.html Use of Diagnoses "Homosexuality" &amp; "Ego-Dystonic Homosexuality"] August 27 &amp; 30, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, a task force of the American Psychological Association undertook a thorough review of the existing research on the efficacy of reparative therapy for. Their report noted that there was very little methodologically sound research on [[sexual orientation change efforts]] (SOCEs) and that the "results of scientifically valid research indicate that it is unlikely that individuals will be able to reduce same-sex attractions or increase other-sex sexual attractions through SOCE." In addition, the task force found that "there are no methodologically sound studies of recent SOCE that would enable the task force to make a definitive statement about whether or not recent SOCE is safe or harmful and for whom."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnostic category of "ego-dystonic homosexuality" was removed from the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] in 1987 (with the publication of the DSM-III-R). Sexual disorders are still present in the DSM under the category of "sexual disorder not otherwise specified". One of the disorders under this category is "persistent and marked distress about one’s sexual orientation”, which can be considered similar to what WHO describes as ego-dystonic sexual orientation.&lt;ref name = newdirections&gt;{{cite book | last = Kleinplatz | first = Peggy J.  | title = New directions in sex therapy: innovations and alternatives | publisher = Psychology Press | year = 2001 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=dY4GentkJY0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage  | isbn = 978-0-87630-967-4 | page = 100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Working Group looking at changes for the [[ICD-11]] (due for implementation in 2018) reports that the classifications in section F66 are not clinically useful and recommends its deletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Proposed declassification of disease categories related to sexual orientation in the ''International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems'' (ICD-11)|first1 = Susan D.|last1 = Cochran|first2 = Jack|last2 = Drescher|authorlink2 = Jack Drescher|first3 = Eszter|last3 = Kismödi|first4 = Alain|last4 = Giami|first5 = Claudia|last5 = García-Moreno|first6 = Elham|last6 = Atalla|first7 = Adele|last7 = Marais|first8 = Elisabeth|last8 = Meloni Vieira|first9 = Geoffrey M.|last9 = Reed|journal = [[Bulletin of the World Health Organization]]|year = 2014|volume = 92|issue = 9|pages = 672–679|doi = 10.2471/BLT.14.135541|pmc = 4208576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Medical Council of India]] uses the WHO classification of ego-dystonic sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pucl.org/Topics/Gender/2003/sexual-minorities.pdf|title=Human rights violations against sexuality minorities in India|publisher=[[People's Union for Civil Liberties]]|date=February 2001|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Chinese Classification and Diagnostic Criteria of Mental Disorders]]'' includes ego-dystonic homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csssm.org/English/e7.htm CSSSM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815232436/http://www.csssm.org/English/e7.htm |date=2007-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
When the WHO removed the diagnosis of homosexuality as a mental disorder in ICD-10, it included the diagnosis of ''ego-dystonic sexual orientation'' under "Psychological and behavioural disorders associated with sexual development and orientation". The WHO's ICD-10 diagnoses ego-dystonic sexual orientation thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The gender identity or sexual preference ([[heterosexual]], [[homosexual]], [[bisexual]], or [[pedophilia|prepubertal]]) is not in doubt, but the individual wishes it were different because of associated psychological and behavioural disorders, and may seek treatment in order to change it. ({{ICD10|F|66|1|f|60}})&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The WHO notes that for codes under F66: "Sexual orientation by itself is not to be regarded as a disorder."&lt;ref name = F66note/&gt;

Patients are sometimes still diagnosed as having this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/matthew-moore-homosexuality-suing_n_5678601.html|title=Gay Man Suing Doctor After His 'Homosexual Behavior' Is Diagnosed As 'Chronic Problem'|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=3 February 2015|author=James Nichols|date=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is often a result of unfavorable and intolerant attitudes of the society or a conflict between sexual urges and religious belief systems.&lt;ref name="Kar2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kar|title=Comprehensive Textbook of Sexual Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YxcjMPbGHQIC&amp;pg=PA177|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Jaypee Brothers Publishers|isbn=978-81-8061-405-7|pages=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatments ==
There are many ways a person may go about receiving therapy for ego-dystonic sexual orientation associated with homosexuality. There is no known therapy for other types of ego-dystonic sexual orientations. Therapy can be aimed at changing [[sexual orientation]], [[Human sexual activity|sexual behaviour]], or helping a client become more comfortable with their sexual orientation and behaviours. Human rights groups have accused some countries of performing these treatments on [[egosyntonic]] homosexuals.&lt;ref name=India&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.infochangeindia.org/agenda4_24.jsp|title = Prayer, punishment or therapy?

=== LGB affirming ===
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
[[Gay affirmative psychotherapy]] helps LGB people to examine and accept their [[sexual orientation]] and related sexual relationships. Psychologists and the whole of mainstream medical professionals endorse that [[homosexuality]] and [[bisexuality]] are not indicative of mental illness.&lt;ref name="apa-guidelines"/&gt; Countering psychiatry, which considered homosexuality to be a [[mental illness]] until 1973, current guidelines instead encourage psychotherapists to assist patients in overcoming the stigma of homosexuality rather than the sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="apa-guidelines"&gt;[http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/guidelines.html APA:Guidelines for Psychotherapy with Lesbian, Gay, &amp; Bisexual Clients]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because some mental health professionals are unfamiliar with the social difficulties of the [[coming out]] process, particular to other factors such as age, race, ethnicity, or religious affiliation, they are encouraged by the APA to learn more about how gay, lesbian, and bisexual clients face discrimination in its various forms. Many gays and lesbians are rejected from their own families and form their own familial relationships and support systems that may also be unfamiliar to mental health professionals, who are encouraged to take into account the diversity of extended relationships in lieu of family.&lt;ref name="apa-guidelines"/&gt;  In gay affirmative psychotherapy, psychologists are encouraged to recognize how their attitudes and knowledge about homosexual and bisexual issues may be relevant to assessment and treatment and seek consultation or make appropriate referrals when indicated. Psychologists strive to understand the ways in which social stigmatization (i.e., prejudice, discrimination, and violence) poses risks to the mental health and well-being of homosexual and bisexual clients. Psychologists strive to understand how inaccurate or prejudicial views of homosexuality or bisexuality may affect the client's presentation in treatment and the therapeutic process.

For some clients, acting on [[same-sex attraction]] may not be a fulfilling solution as it may conflict with their religious beliefs; licensed mental health providers may approach such a situation by neither rejecting nor promoting [[celibacy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/therapeutic-response.pdf Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation]&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Haldeman has argued that for individuals who seek therapy because of frustration surrounding "seemingly irreconcilable internal differences" between "their sexual and religious selves... neither a gay-affirmative nor a conversion therapy approach [may be] indicated," and that "[just as] therapists in the religious world [should] refrain from pathologizing their LGB clients... so, too, should gay-affirmative practitioners refrain from overtly or subtly devaluing those who espouse conservative religious identities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haldeman |first=Douglas |url=http://tcp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/32/5/691?ck=nck |title=When Sexual and Religious Orientation Collide:Considerations in Working with Conflicted Same-Sex Attracted Male Clients |publisher=The Counseling Psychologist |volume=32 |issue=5 |year=2004 |doi=10.1177/0011000004267560 |journal=The Counseling Psychologist |pages=691–715}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Data suggest that clients generally judge therapists who do not respect religiously-based identity outcomes to be unhelpful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url         = http://www.drthrockmorton.com/jpcreorientation.pdf |title       = Counseling practices as they relate to ratings of helpfulness by consumers of sexual reorientation therapy |last        = Throckmorton |first       = Warren |author2     = Welton |date        = Winter 2005 |publisher   = Journal of Psychology and Christianity |volume      = 24 |issue       = 4 |pages       = 332–42 |format      = PDF |deadurl     = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20081001214830/http://www.drthrockmorton.com/jpcreorientation.pdf |archivedate = 2008-10-01 |df          = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the emerging areas of research regarding gay affirmative psychotherapy is related to the process of assisting LGBTQ individuals from religious backgrounds feel comfortable with their sexual and gender orientation. Narrative analyses of clinicians' reports regarding gay affirmative psychotherapy suggest that the majority of conflicts discussed within the therapeutic context by gay men and their relatives from religious backgrounds are related to the interaction between family, self, and religion. Clinicians report that gay men and their families struggle more frequently with the institution, community, and practices of religion rather than directly with God. Chana Etengoff and Colette Daiute report in the Journal of Homosexuality that clinicians most frequently address these tensions by emphasizing the mediational strategies of increasing self-awareness, seeking secular support (e.g., PFLAG), and increasing positive communication between family members.&lt;ref&gt;Etengoff, C. &amp; Daiute, C., (2015). [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00918369.2014.977115 Clinicians’ perspectives of religious families’ and gay men’s negotiation of sexual orientation disclosure and prejudice], Journal of Homosexuality, 62(3), 394-426. doi: 10.1080/00918369.2014.977115&lt;/ref&gt;

==== LGB support groups ====
LGB groups help counteract and buffer [[minority stress]], marginalization, and isolation.&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt; They focus on helping a person with ego-dystonic sexual orientation accept their sexual orientation.

=== Sexual orientation change efforts ===
{{Main|Sexual orientation change efforts}}
A task force commissioned by the APA found that religious identity and how one outwardly identifies one's sexual orientation (see [[sexual orientation identity]]) can develop through life.  [[Psychotherapy]], [[support group]]s, and life events can influence how one identifies privately and publicly. Similarly, self-awareness, and self-conception may evolve during treatment.&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt; Some practitioners insist that improvement may be seen in emotional adjustment (self-stigma and shame reduction), and personal beliefs, values and norms (change of religious and moral belief, behaviour and motivation).&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt;&lt;ref name="Psych"&gt;{{cite web |url         = http://www.aglp.org/pages/cfactsheets.html#Anchor-Gay-14210 |title       = Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Issues |author      = [[American Psychiatric Association]] |publisher   = Association of Gay and Lesbian Psychiatrics |date        = May 2000 |deadurl     = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090103200307/http://www.aglp.org/pages/cfactsheets.html#Anchor-Gay-14210 |archivedate = 2009-01-03 |df          = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such an approach to treatment is widely regarded as poorly-advised, risky and potentially damaging to the individual.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/10/orientation.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Psychological Association "encourages mental health professionals to avoid misrepresenting the efficacy of sexual orientation change efforts by promoting or promising change in sexual orientation when providing assistance to individuals distressed by their own or others’ sexual orientation and concludes that the benefits reported by participants in sexual orientation change efforts can be gained through approaches that do not attempt to change sexual orientation".&lt;ref name=apa2009&gt;American Psychological Association: [http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/sexual-orientation.aspx Resolution on Appropriate Affirmative Responses to Sexual Orientation Distress and Change Efforts, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The APA reviewed research into the efficacy of efforts to change sexual orientation, and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to show whether these were effective or not.&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt; Participants have reported both harm and benefit from such efforts, but no causal relationship has been determined between either the benefit or the harm.&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt; According to a recent APA study, participants who reported harm generally reported "anger, anxiety, confusion, depression, grief, guilt, hopelessness, deteriorated relationships with family, loss of social support, loss of faith, poor self-image, social isolation, intimacy difficulties, intrusive imagery, suicidal ideation, self-hatred, and sexual dysfunction. These reports of perceptions of harm are countered by accounts of perceptions of relief, happiness, improved relationships with God, and perceived improvement in mental health status".&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt;

No major mental health professional organization has sanctioned efforts to change sexual orientation and virtually all of them have adopted policy statements cautioning the profession and the public about treatments that purport to change sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Herek"&gt;[http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/gill-v-office-of-personnel-management/2009-11-17-doma-aff-herek.pdf Expert affidavit of Gregory M.

==== Conversion therapy ====
{{Main|Conversion therapy}}
The APA has roundly dismissed so-called conversion therapy (sometimes called "ex-gay" therapy) as unproductive and potentially harmful.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apa.org/about/policy/sexual-orientation.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

One version of conversion therapy, Gender Wholeness Therapy was designed by an ex-gay [[Licensed Professional Counselor]], David Matheson.&lt;ref name="nytconversion"&gt;{{cite news | first = Michael | last = Luo | title = Some Tormented by Homosexuality Look to a Controversial Therapy | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/12/nyregion/12group.html | publisher = The New York Times | page = 1 | date = 2007-02-12 | accessdate = 2007-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The emphasis in Mr. Matheson's counselling is on helping men — all his clients are male — develop 'gender wholeness' by addressing emotional issues and building healthy connections with other men. He says he believes that helps reduce homosexual desires.&lt;ref name="nytconversion"/&gt;

Another variation of conversion therapy, "gender-affirmative therapy" has been described by [[A. Dean Byrd]] as follows: "The basic premise of gender-affirmative therapy is that social and emotional variables affect gender identity which, in turn, determines sexual orientation. The work of the therapist is to help people understand their gender development. Subsequently, such individuals are able to make choices that are consistent with their value system. The focus of therapy is to help clients fully develop their masculine or feminine identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url         = http://www.regent.edu/acad/schlaw/academics/lawreview/articles/14_2Byrd.pdf |format      = &amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?q=author%3AByrd+intitle%3AHomosexuality%3A+Innate+and+Immutable%3F&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=2002&amp;as_yhi=2002&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |title       = Homosexuality: Innate and Immutable? |first       = A.

Several organizations have started retreats led by coaches aimed at helping participants diminish same-sex desires. These retreats tend to use a variety of techniques. Journey into Manhood, put on by [[People Can Change]], uses "a wide variety of large-group, small-group and individual exercises, from journaling to visualizations (or guided imagery) to group sharing and intensive emotional-release work."&lt;ref name=weekends&gt;{{cite web |url         = http://www.narth.com/docs/weekends.html |title       = Journey Into Manhood: A Healing Weekend Hosted by People Can Change |accessdate  = 2007-10-01 |date        = 2006-04-20 |publisher   = NARTH |deadurl     = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080121180438/http://www.narth.com/docs/weekends.html |archivedate = 2008-01-21 |df          = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Weekends put on by Adventure in Manhood support "healthy bonding with men, through masculine activity, teamwork, and socialization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.adventureinmanhood.com|title = Adventure in Manhood homepage|accessdate = 2007-10-29|publisher = Self-published}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not specific to gay men, several gay men attended the New Warrior Training Adventure, a weekend put on by [[ManKind Project]], which is a "process of initiation and self-examination that is designed to catalyse the development of a healthy and mature masculine self."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mkpnm.org/weekend.html|title = The New Warrior Weekend|accessdate = 2007-10-29|publisher = Self-published}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Dallas]], a prominent ex-gay, leads a monthly five-day men's retreat on sexual purity titled, Every Man's Battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title       = 'Love Won Out' conference coming to Southern California |publisher   = Christian Examiner |url         = http://www.christianexaminer.com/Articles/Articles%20Sep07/Art_Sep07_13.html |date        = September 2007 |deadurl     = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110929155104/http://www.christianexaminer.com/Articles/Articles%20Sep07/Art_Sep07_13.html |archivedate = 2011-09-29 |df          = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several reparative therapies have been established, including:

*Sexual identity therapy was designed by [[Warren Throckmorton]] and Mark Yarhouse, and was endorsed by [[Robert L. Spitzer]],&lt;ref name="New Ground"&gt;{{cite news |url         = http://wthrockmorton.com/2007/06/18/la-times-article-features-ex-gay-debate-and-sexual-identity-therapy |title       = New ground in debate on 'curing' gays |last        = Simon |first       = Stephanie |publisher   = [[Los Angeles Times]] |date        = 2007-06-18 |accessdate  = 2007-10-29 |deadurl     = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20081013174508/http://wthrockmorton.com/2007/06/18/la-times-article-features-ex-gay-debate-and-sexual-identity-therapy/ |archivedate = 2008-10-13 |df          = }}&lt;/ref&gt; prior to Spitzer's backing away from this belief that he had proven reparative therapy at times successful.&lt;ref name="truthwinsout.org"/&gt; Its purpose is to help patients line up their sexual identity with their beliefs and values. Therapy involves four phases: (1) assessment, (2) advanced or expanded informed consent, (3) psychotherapy, and (4) social integration of a valued sexual identity.
*[[Group psychotherapy]] uses group sessions led by a single psychologist and focuses on conflict surrounding homosexual expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wolf TJ |title=Group psychotherapy for bisexual men and their wives |journal=J Homosex |volume=14 |issue=1–2 |pages=191–9 |year=1987 |pmid=3655341 |doi=10.1300/J082v14n01_14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Context Specific Therapy was designed by Jeffrey Robinson. It does not work with any one theory of homosexuality, but uses several theoretical backgrounds according to the client's need,&lt;ref name="What is RT"&gt;{{cite web |last        = Throckmorton |first       = Warren |url         = http://www.drthrockmorton.com/article.asp?id=4 |title       = What is reparative therapy? |publisher   = Self-published |year        = 2004 |accessdate  = 2007-10-29 |deadurl     = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224422/http://www.drthrockmorton.com/article.asp?id=4 |archivedate = 2007-09-26 |df          = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on phenomenological research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.narth.com/docs/2003conference.html |title = NARTH 2003 Annual Conference schedule |publisher = NARTH |date = 2004-04-14 |accessdate = 2007-10-29| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061115075723/http://www.narth.com/docs/2003conference.html| archivedate = November 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not seek to change the client's orientation, but instead focuses on diminishing homosexual thoughts and behaviours. It works within the client's own view of God, noting that "individuals who are successful at overcoming homosexual problems are motivated by strong religious values".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url         = http://www.theguardrail.com/whatis.htm |title       = What is Context Specific Therapy? |accessdate  = 2007-10-29 |last        = Jeffrey |first       = Robinson |publisher   = Self-published |deadurl     = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071107172359/http://www.theguardrail.com/whatis.htm |archivedate = 2007-11-07 |df          = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*MAP Therapy is designed for both the individual with ego-dystonic sexual orientation and their family members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journeyprograms.com/ Journey Programs]&lt;/ref&gt; There are four main paths that clients may choose to take: (1) they can affirm an LGB identity, (2) they can foster a lifestyle of celibacy, (3) they can work on developing heterosexual attractions, or (4) they can explore their options.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maptherapy.org/ MAP therapy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ex-gay organizations ====
{{Main|Ex-gay}}
[[File:One by One booth.jpg|thumb|150px|[[OneByOne]], an ex-gay organization, hosts a booth at a [[Love Won Out]] conference]]
For some ex-gay groups, choosing not to act on one's same-sex desires counts as a success&lt;ref name="regent"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sexualidentityinstitute.org/?page_id=13 |title = Frequently Asked Questions |publisher = Regent University: Institute for the Study of Sexual Identity |accessdate = 2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas conversion therapists tend to understand success in terms of reducing or eliminating those desires. For example, some ex-gays in [[mixed-orientation marriage]]s acknowledge that their sexual attractions remain primarily homosexual, but seek to make their marriages work regardless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Anonymous | title = No easy victory | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2002/003/2.50.html | publisher = Christianity Today | date = 2002-03-11 | accessdate = 2007-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-gay advocates sometimes compare adopting the label "ex-gay" to the [[coming out]] process.&lt;ref name="peebles"&gt;{{cite journal |last        = Peebles |first       = Amy E. |date        = April 2003 |title       = It's Not Coming Out, So Then What Is It?

Some ex-gay organizations follow the tenets of a specific religion, while others try to encompass a more general spirituality. Although most ex-gay organizations were started by American [[evangelical Christians]], there are now ex-gay organizations in other parts of the world and for [[Catholics]], [[Mormons]], [[Jews]] and [[Muslims]]. According to Douglas Haldeman, "This modality is thought to be one of the most common for individuals seeking to change their sexual orientation."&lt;ref name="haldeman"&gt;

Ex-gay groups use several different techniques. [[Love in Action]] hosts workshops on "child development, gender roles, and [[personal sexuality]]," one-on-one Biblical guidance, "a structured environment help[ing] establish new routines and healthy patterns of behaviour", "challenging written assignments and interactive projects," "family involvement to improve communication... and to facilitate marital reconciliation," and "hiking, camping, canoeing, and rafting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.loveinaction.org/default.aspx?pid=91|title = the source|accessdate = 2007-08-28|publisher = Love in Action}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.loveinaction.org/default.aspx?pid=93|title = the journey|accessdate = 2007-08-28|publisher = Love in Action}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exodus International]] considers reparative therapy to be a useful tool, but not a necessary one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exodus.to/content/view/34/117/  |title=Exodus International Policy Statements  |accessdate=2007-08-28  |publisher=Exodus International  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010931/http://exodus.to/content/view/34/117/  |archivedate=2007-09-28  |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evergreen International]] did not advocate or discourage particular therapies&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==== Criticism ====
[[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert L. Spitzer]] reported in 2003 that individuals who reported experiencing a change in sexual orientation had felt depressed or even suicidal prior to treatment "precisely because they had previously thought there was no hope for them, and they had been told by many mental health professionals that there was no hope for them, they had to just learn to live with their homosexual feelings."&lt;ref&gt;Adler, S. &amp; Levin, E.

=== Exploratory therapy===
The APA has specifically advised against sexual orientation change efforts and encourages practitioners to aid those who seek sexual orientation change by utilizing affirmative multiculturally competent therapy that recognizes the negative impact of social stigma on sexual minorities and balances ethical principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence, justice, and respect for people's rights and dignity.  If a client wants to change his sexual orientation, the therapist should help the client come to their own decisions by evaluating the reasons behind the patient's goals.&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt;

== Relationship to religion ==
{{further|Religion and homosexuality}}

The terms ''egodystonic'' and ''egosyntonic'' are used within the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in that, according to gay-rights advocate Bernard Lynch, priests who are gay but egodystonic, that is "hate their homosexuality", are acceptable, whereas egosyntonic candidates for the priesthood, those who accept their own sexuality, cannot be considered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InWjCcStFVE BBC HARDtalk - Father Bernard Lynch], 27 Feb 2013.  See at 4m20s&lt;/ref&gt;

Some churches publish specific instructions to clergy on how to minister to gay and lesbian people. These include ''[[Ministry to Persons with a Homosexual Inclination]]'', produced by the Catholic Church, and ''[[God Loveth His Children]]'', produced by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. In 1994, a church in the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] held a conference entitled “The Path to Freedom: Exploring healing for the Homosexual.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url         = http://oneby1.org/aboutus.html |title       = OneByOne: About Us |accessdate  = 2007-10-29 |year        = 2006 |publisher   = Self-published |deadurl     = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927120845/http://oneby1.org/aboutus.html |archivedate = 2007-09-27 |df          = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The APA encourages religious leaders to recognize that it is outside their role to adjudicate empirical scientific issues in psychology.&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt;

Mental health practitioners can incorporate religion into therapy by "integrating aspects of the psychology of religion into their work, including by obtaining a thorough assessment of clients’ spiritual and religious beliefs, religious identity and motivations, and spiritual functioning; improving positive religious coping; and exploring the intersection of religious and sexual orientation identities."&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt; Researchers have found that for some clients who have 'identity conflicts' these can be reduced by reading religious texts that increase self-authority and allow them to reduce their focus on negative messages about homosexuality. Researchers also found that such clients made further progress if they came to believe that regardless of their sexual orientation, their God still loves and accepts them.&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt;

Some gay and lesbian people choose [[LGBT-affirming religious groups]], change churches to those that affirm LGBT people, or simply leave religion.&lt;ref name = apa2009/&gt;

'''Emotional and behavioral disorders''' ('''EBD'''; also known as '''behavioural and emotional disorders''' ([[ICD-10]]);&lt;ref name="ICD-10-web-EN"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[World Health Organization]] |url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2016/en#/F90 |title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10): Behavioural and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence (F90–F98) |date=2016 |access-date=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICD-10-Clinical"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[World Health Organization]] |url=http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf |title=The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders. Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines |place=[[Geneva]] |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes called '''emotional disturbance''' or '''serious emotional disturbance''') refer to a disability classification used in educational settings that allows educational institutions to provide [[special education]] and related services to students that have poor social or academic adjustment that cannot be better explained by biological abnormalities or a [[developmental disability]]. 

The classification is often given to students, after conducting a Functional Behavior Analysis. These students need individualized [[classroom management|behavior supports]] such as a Behavior Intervention Plan, to receive a [[free and appropriate public education]]. They would not be eligible for an [[individualized education program]] under another disability category of the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA).

==Criteria==
The IDEA requires that a student must exhibit one or more of the following characteristics over a long duration, and to a marked degree that adversely affects their educational performance, to receive an EBD classification:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parentcenterhub.org/repository/categories/|title=Categories of Disability Under IDEA|work=parentcenterhub.org|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Difficulty to learn that cannot be explained by intellectual, sensory, or health factors.
* Difficulty to build or maintain satisfactory interpersonal relationships with peers and teachers.
* Inappropriate types of behavior (acting out against self or others) or feelings (expresses the need to harm self or others, low self-worth, etc.) under normal circumstances.
* A general pervasive mood of unhappiness or depression.
* A tendency to develop physical symptoms or fears associated with personal or school problems.

The term "EBD" includes students diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]], but does not apply to students who are "socially maladjusted", unless it is determined that they also meet the criteria for an EBD classification.

===Criticisms===
Providing or failing to provide an EBD classification to a student may be controversial, as the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|IDEA]] does not clarify which children would be considered "socially maladjusted", but ineligible for an [[individualized education program]] under an EBD classification. Some states do not allow students with a psychiatric diagnosis of [[conduct disorder]] to receive additional educational services under an EBD classification,&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cecp.air.org/resources/20th/eligchar.asp/ |title=Students with Emotional Disturbance: Eligibility and Characteristics |work=cecp.air.org |accessdate=22 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018115029/http://cecp.air.org/resources/20th/eligchar.asp |archivedate=18 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although many students with an EBD classification do meet the diagnostic criteria for various [[disruptive behavior disorder]]s, including [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[oppositional defiant disorder]] (ODD), or [[conduct disorder]] (CD).&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt; Additionally, students considered "socially maladjusted", but ineligible for an EBD classification (i.e., students diagnosed with [[conduct disorder]]), often receive better educational services in special education classrooms or alternative schools with high structure, clear rules, and consistent consequences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behavior-consultant.com/social.htm|title=Social Maladjustment|work=behavior-consultant.com|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they would not receive in general education settings. The ambiguous guidelines for determining what students are "socially maladjusted", but without EBD, may cause many students that would benefit from special education services to receive less effective educational services.

==Student characteristics==
Students with EBD are a diverse population, and have a wide range of intellectual and academic abilities. Males, African-Americans, and economically disadvantaged students are overrepresented in the EBD population, and students with EBD are more likely to live in single-parent homes, foster homes, or other non-traditional living situations.&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt; They also tend to have low rates of positive social interactions with students and peers in instructional contexts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wehby|first1=Joseph|last2=Symons|first2=F.|last3=Shores|first3=R. E.|title=A descriptive analysis of aggressive behavior in classrooms for children with emotional and behavioral disorders|journal=Behavioral Disorders|date=1995|volume=20|pages=87–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many have one or more comorbid psychiatric diagnoses.&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt; Students with EBD are often categorized as [[internalizing disorder|"internalizers"]] (e.g., have poor [[self-esteem]], or are diagnosed with an [[anxiety disorder]] or [[mood disorder]]) or [[Emotional and behavioral disorders#Internalizing and externalizing behavior|"externalizers"]] (e.g., disrupt classroom instruction, or are diagnosed with [[disruptive behavior disorders]] such as [[oppositional defiant disorder]] and [[conduct disorder]]). Male students may be overrepresented in the EBD population because they tend to exhibit disruptive externalizing behavior that interferes with classroom instruction, whereas females more commonly exhibit internalizing behavior that does not interfere with classroom instruction;&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt; thus, teachers may refer males for special education services more often than females. Students with EBD are also at an increased risk for [[learning disabilities]], [[school dropout]], [[substance abuse]], and [[juvenile delinquency]].&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt;

==Internalizing and externalizing behavior==
A person with EBD with [[internalizing disorder|"internalizing" behavior]] may have poor [[self-esteem]], suffer from [[depression (mood)|depression]], experience [[anhedonia|loss of interest]] in social, academic, and other life activities, and may exhibit [[non-suicidal self-injury]] or [[substance abuse]]. Students with internalizing behavior may also have a diagnosis of [[separation anxiety]] or another [[anxiety disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[specific phobia|specific]] or [[social phobia]], [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD), [[panic disorder]], and/or an [[eating disorder]]. Some research suggests students with EBD with internalizing behavior are underdiagnosed; teachers are more likely to write referrals for students that are overtly disruptive, and screening tools to detect students with high levels of internalizing behavior are not sensitive and are rarely used in practice.&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt;

Students with EBD with "[[Externalizing Disorders|externalizing]]" behavior may be aggressive, noncompliant, extroverted, or disruptive, and generally "act out" inappropriately. Students with EBD that show externalizing behavior are often diagnosed with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[oppositional defiant disorder]] (ODD), [[conduct disorder]], and/or [[bipolar disorder]]; however, this population can also include typically developing children that have [[operant conditioning|learned]] to exhibit externalizing behavior for various reasons (e.g., [[Reinforcement#Positive and negative|escape from academic demands]] or [[Reinforcement#Positive and negative|access to attention]]). These students often have difficulty inhibiting emotional responses resulting from anger, frustration, and disappointment, and may exhibit behaviors such as insulting, provoking, threatening, bullying, cursing, and fighting, along with other forms of aggression; noncompliance with and disrespect towards teachers and other authority figures is also common. Male students with EBD exhibit externalizing behavior more often than their female counterparts.&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt;

'''Folk economics''' is the intuitive [[economics]] of [[Training|untrained]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rubin |first=Paul H. |title=Folk Economics |journal=Southern Economic Journal |date=July 2003 |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=157–171 |jstor=1061637 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is derived from the evolutionary basis for human intelligence.  In the evolutionary environment, life was static; there was essentially no economic growth and no innovation.  Moreover, there was relatively little specialization (except by age and gender) and the economy was simple.  Thus, our brains evolved to understand this sort of economy.  While there were many implications of such an economy,one of the most important is that we evolved to be zero-sum thinkers.  that is, when faced with an economic issue our natural tendency is to view it in zero-sum terms.  This leads to fallacies such as dislike of international trade and immigration.  Indeed, zero-sum thinking is probably the most important source of inefficient economic policies.

A '''gallery grave''' is a form of [[megalithic]] tomb built primarily during the [[Neolithic|Neolithic Age]]{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}} in [[Europe]] in which the main [[Long gallery|gallery]] of the tomb is entered without first passing through an [[antechamber]] or [[hallway]].{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}}{{sfn|Daniel|2013|page=9}}{{sfn|Price|2013|page=185}} There are at least four major types of gallery grave (complex, [[transepted gallery grave|transepted]], segmented, and [[wedge-shaped gallery grave|wedge-shaped]]), and they may be covered with an earthen mound (or "[[tumulus]]") or rock mound (or "[[cairn]]").

==About gallery graves==
Archeologist T. Douglas Price argues that the gallery grave was a form of community burial site. Those placed in a gallery grave were most likely members of the same family or hamlet, and probably were intended to reinforce the sense of community.{{sfn|Price|2013|page=185}}

Gallery graves may be straight, or they may form an [[Ell (architecture)|ell]].{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}} In some cases, a burial chamber exists at the end of the gallery.{{sfn|Daniel|2013|page=70}} The walls of gallery graves were built of [[Megalithic architectural elements#Orthostat|orthostats]], slab-like stones set upright in the earth.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|page=598}}{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=49}} They were roofed with multiple flat stones, although the burial chamber (if one existed) was usually roofed with a single large stone.{{sfn|Wilder|1924|page=101}} Multiple burials could occur all at one time, the grave could be reopened several times to accept new burials, or the grave could remain open over an extended period of time to accept multiple burials.{{sfn|Wilder|1924|page=99}}

[[File:Bézier - Plan de la roche-aux-fées.png|thumb|Drawing of the plan of the segmented gallery grave at La Roche-aux-Fées in France. Capstones (forming the ceiling) are represented by dotted lines.]]
Burials in gallery graves were made in the gallery itself, or in small burial chambers opening off the gallery.{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}}{{sfn|Roe|1970|page=139}} This is known as a "complex gallery grave".{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}} When the adjacent burial chambers are paired, the structure is known as a "[[transepted gallery grave]]".{{sfn|Roe|1970|page=139}}{{sfn|Daniel|2013|page=40}} Gallery graves may also have their galleries subdivided by interior stone slabs.{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}}{{sfn|Roe|1970|page=139}} These are known as "segmented gallery graves".{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}} When two parallel galleries lead to a single terminal burial chamber, this is known as a "parallel gallery grave".{{sfn|Wilder|1924|page=101}}

Some gallery graves were not rectangular in shape, but rather narrowed toward the rear.{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=46}} These are known as [[wedge-shaped gallery grave]]s.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|page=598}} The ceilings of wedge-shaped gallery graves often sloped toward the rear,{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|page=598}}{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=46}} and a sill of stone set some distance inside the away from the entrance{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|page=598}} or one or two slabs set upright in the earth{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=46}} defined a sort of antechamber. The wedge-shaped gallery grave was usually topped by a [[cairn]] (covering of stones) rather than an earthen mound (or "[[tumulus]]"),{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|page=598}} although an earthen mound was sometimes used.{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|pages=46-47}} The cross-sectional shape of the cairn could be round, oval, or D-shaped, and often a [[Megalithic architectural elements#Kerb or peristalith|kerb]] (ring of stone) was used to help [[Revetment|revet]] the cairn and keep it in place.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|page=598}}{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=47}} Some wedge-shaped gallery graves had curved rear walls, while others were linear.{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=46}} A few had the terminal burial chamber at the rear of the gallery, although this was usually blocked off.{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=46}} Wedge-shaped gallery graves sometimes had a set of outer walls. These could be parallel to the inner walls, or they could be set at an even stronger angle (emphasizing the wedge-like nature of the tomb).{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=46}} Wedge-shaped gallery graves usually faced west, and often had a pair of upright stone slabs linking the inner and outer walls at the entrance.{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=46}}

The tumulus (or "barrow") covering a gallery grave may be [[oval barrow|ovate]] or [[long barrow|long]].{{sfn|Chadwick|Fox|Dickins|2013|page=9}} The sides of the tumulus may be parallel or not.{{sfn|Chadwick|Fox|Dickins|2013|pages=5, 9}} The tumulus was designed so that the end of the gallery (or the terminal burial chamber, if one existed) was at the center of the tumulus.{{sfn|Wilder|1924|page=101}} A tumulus may contain several gallery graves radiating outward from the center.{{sfn|Wilder|1924|page=101}} Since the earth atop the gallery grave was only loosely piled up, it often washed away due to erosion. Many gallery graves today lie exposed to the air, when originally they would have lain deep within a tumulus.{{sfn|Wilder|1924|pages=101-102}}

===Transepted===
'''Transepted gallery graves''' have burial monuments with side rooms extending laterally from a central chamber. They are found at sites in the [[Loire]] valley of France, south west [[Great Britain]] and in [[Ireland]] and it is thought the builders had cultural links with one another.

===Wedge-shaped===
[[File:Altair Burial Tomb, Schull, Co. Cork.jpg|thumb|[[Altar Wedge Tomb]], County Cork]]
[[File:Glantane East Wedge Tomb.jpg|thumb|[[Glantane East]] Wedge Tomb, County Cork, Ireland]]
A '''wedge-shaped [[gallery grave]]''' or '''wedge tomb''' is a type of [[Ireland|Irish]] [[chamber tomb]]. They are so named because the burial chamber narrows at one end (usually decreasing both in height and width from west to east), producing a wedge shape in elevation. An [[antechamber]] is separated from the burial area by a simple [[jamb]] or sill, and the doorway generally faces west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= BBC History | year= 2004 | title= Irish Neolithic Tombs'' | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3181673| accessdate=2006-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinguishing characteristic of wedge tombs is the double-walling of the gallery. They were often covered by [[cairn]]s, which could be round, oval or D-shaped, often with a [[Megalithic architectural elements|kerb]] to revet it. More are low sized, usually about 1.5 metres high, and are generally found on mountainsides, about three-quarters the way up.

Wedge tombs were built between the Irish late  [[Neolithic]] and middle [[Bronze Age]]s (about 2500 to 2000BC). Today, between 500 and 550 known wedge tombs survive in Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= iol.ie | year= | title= ''A Brief Guide To Irish Archaeological Sites'' | url=http://www.iol.ie/~sec/sites.htm#Wedge%20Tombs| accessdate=2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are found predominantly in the west and north west of the island.


===Dating===
Along with the [[dolmen]] and [[passage grave]], the gallery grave is the most common megalithic tomb in western Europe.{{sfn|Price|2013|page=184}}{{sfn|Piggott|1965|page=61}}

Gallery graves were usually constructed during the Neolithic Age, which began about 10,200 BC and ended in Europe about 3,200 BC.{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}} Some, however, were constructed in the Middle and Late [[Bronze Age]], about 2,300 BC to 600 BC.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|page=598}} Dating of some gallery graves is difficult, as the tombs may have been constructed in the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, but reopened and used for burials until the Late Bronze Age.{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=47}}

===Gallery vs. passage grave===
The difference between a complex gallery grave and a [[passage grave]] (which also has smaller burial chambers opening off the main passage) is two-fold.  First, the gallery grave gallery will be as high and wide as the side burial chambers, while in a passage grave the passage is not as high or wide as the burial chambers.  Second, gallery graves are usually topped by a V-shaped tumulus, while passage graves are almost always covered by a round tumulus.{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}}

==Recognized gallery graves==
[[File:17. Labbacallee Wedge Tomb, Co. Cork.jpg|thumb|Interior of Labbacallee, a wedge-shaped gallery grave in Ireland.]]
Archeologists Ian Shaw and Robert Jameson argued in 1999 that the best-researched gallery graves are the [[Severn-Cotswold tomb]]s in [[Wales]] and [[South West England]] in the [[United Kingdom]].{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}} Other important gallery graves include:

* [[Court cairn]], found in western and northern [[Ireland]] and southwest [[Scotland]]
* [[Giants' grave]] in [[Sardinia]]
* [[Glantane East]] wedge-shaped tomb in Ireland
* [[Naveta]] grave in [[Menorca]]
* [[Seine-Oise-Marne culture]] ''allées couverte'' in northern [[France]] and southern [[Belgium]]
* Severn-Cotswold tombs in Wales and South West England in the United Kingdom{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}}
* [[Wartberg culture#Megalithic tombs|Wartberg culture]] stone cist group tombs in northern [[Hesse]], southern [[Lower Saxony]], and western [[Thuringia]] in [[Germany]]

{{Refimprove|date=January 2008}}

The '''gene pool''' is the set of all [[gene]]s, or genetic information, in any [[population]], usually of a particular [[species]].

== Description ==
A large gene pool indicates extensive [[genetic diversity]], which is associated with robust populations that can survive bouts of intense [[Selection (biology)|selection]]. Meanwhile, low [[genetic diversity]] (see [[inbreeding]] and [[population bottleneck]]s) can cause reduced [[fitness (biology)|biological fitness]] and an increased chance of [[extinction]], although as explained by [[genetic drift]] new genetic variants, that may cause an increase in the [[Physical fitness|fitness]] of organisms, are more likely to fix in the population if it is rather small.

When all individuals in a population are identical with regard to a particular [[phenotypic]] trait, the population is said to be 'monomorphic'. When the individuals show several variants of a particular trait they are said to be [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]].

== History ==
The Russian geneticist Aleksandr Sergeevich Serebrovskii first formulated the concept in the 1920s as ''genofond'' (gene fund), a word that was imported to the United States from the Soviet Union by [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], who translated it into English as “gene pool.”&lt;ref name="LonelyIdeas"&gt;{{cite book |last=Graham |first=Loren |date=2013 |title=Lonely Ideas: Can Russia Compete? |publisher=MIT Press |page=169 |isbn=978-0-262-01979-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gene pool concept in crop breeding ==
Harlan and de Wet (1971) proposed classifying each crop and its related species by gene pools rather than by formal taxonomy.&lt;ref name= "Harlan&amp;DeWet1971"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Harlan, J.R. |author2=Wet, J.M.J.d. |year=1971|title=Toward a Rational Classification of Cultivated Plants|journal=Taxon|volume=20|issue=4|pages=509–517|jstor=1218252|doi=10.2307/1218252}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Primary gene pool (GP-1): Members of this gene pool are probably in the same "[[species]]" (in conventional biological usage) and can intermate freely. Harlan and de Wet wrote, "Among forms of this gene pool, crossing is easy; [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] are generally fertile with good chromosome pairing; gene segregation is approximately normal and [[Horizontal gene transfer|gene transfer]] is generally easy.".&lt;ref name= "Harlan&amp;DeWet1971" /&gt; They also advised subdividing each crop gene pool in two:
#*Subspecies A: Cultivated races
#*Subspecies B: Spontaneous races (wild or weedy)
#Secondary gene pool (GP-2): Members of this pool are probably normally classified as different species than the crop species under consideration (the primary gene pool). However, these species are closely related and can cross and produce at least some fertile hybrids. As would be expected by members of different species, there are some reproductive barriers between members of the primary and secondary gene pools:
#*hybrids may be weak
#*hybrids may be partially sterile
#*[[chromosomes]] may pair poorly or not at all
#*recovery of desired [[phenotype]]s may be difficult in subsequent generations
#*However, "The gene pool is available to be utilized, however, if the plant breeder or geneticist is willing to put out the effort required."&lt;ref name= "Harlan&amp;DeWet1971" /&gt;
#Tertiary gene pool (GP-3): Members of this gene pool are more distantly related to the members of the primary gene pool. The primary and tertiary gene pools can be intermated, but [[gene]] transfer between them is impossible without the use of "rather extreme or radical measures" &lt;ref name= "Harlan&amp;DeWet1971" /&gt; such as:
#*embryo rescue (or embryo culture, a form of plant [[organ culture]])
#*induced [[polyploidy]] (chromosome doubling)
#*bridging crosses (e.g., with members of the secondary gene pool).

== Gene pool centres ==
Gene pool centres refers to areas on the earth where important crop plants and domestic animals originated. They have an extraordinary range of the wild counterparts of cultivated plant species and useful tropical plants.
Gene pool centres also contain different sub tropical and temperate region species.

[[File:What is Gross National Happiness.ogv|thumb|330px|"What is Gross National Happiness", an info-graphical video.]]

[[File:Bhutan Gross National Happiness.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|Slogan about Gross National Happiness in Thimphu's School of Traditional Arts.]]

'''Gross National Happiness''' (also known by the acronym: '''GNH''') is a [[philosophy]] that guides the government of [[Bhutan]]. It includes an index which is used to measure the collective happiness and well-being of a population. Gross National Happiness is instituted as the goal of the government of Bhutan in the [[Constitution of Bhutan]], enacted on 18 July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Kingdom of Bhutan|url=http://www.nationalcouncil.bt/assets/uploads/files/Constitution%20%20of%20Bhutan%20English.pdf|website=National Council|publisher=Royal Government of Bhutan|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Gross National Happiness'' was coined in 1972 during an interview by a British journalist for the Financial Times at [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport|Bombay airport]] when the then [[List of rulers of Bhutan|king of Bhutan]], [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]], said "Gross National Happiness is more important than [[Gross domestic product|Gross National Product]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dorji|first1=Tashi|title=The story of a king, a poor country, and a rich idea|url=http://earthjournalism.net/stories/6468|accessdate=1 April 2017|publisher=Business Bhutan|date=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://earthjournalism.net/stories/6468|title=The story of a king, a poor country, and a rich idea|last1=Dorji|first1=Tashi|date=15 June 2012|accessdate=1 April 2017|publisher=Business Bhutan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gnhc.gov.bt/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GNH-FAQs-pdf.pdf|title=FAQ on GNH|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, The UN General Assembly passed Resolution "Happiness: towards a holistic approach to development" urging member nations to follow the example of Bhutan and measure happiness and well-being and calling happiness a "fundamental human goal."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://repository.un.org/handle/11176/291712|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017150819/http://repository.un.org/handle/11176/291712|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2017-10-17|title=Happiness : towards a holistic approach to development : resolution / adopted by the General Assembly|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Bhutan's Prime Minister Jigme Thinley and the Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon of the United Nations convened the ''High Level Meeting: Well-being and Happiness: Defining a New Economic Paradigm'' to encourage the spread of Bhutan's GNH philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?page=view&amp;type=400&amp;nr=617&amp;menu=35|title=Defining a New Economic Paradigm: The Report of the High-Level Meeting on Wellbeing and Happiness|author=Bhutan|date=2012|publisher=United Nations|access-date=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the High Level meeting, the first [[World Happiness Report]] was issued.  Shortly after the High Level meeting, 20 March was declared to be International Day of Happiness by the UN in 2012 with resolution 66/28.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/66/281|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 28 June 2012 66/281. International Day of Happiness|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhutan's [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]] [[Tshering Tobgay]] proclaimed a preference for focus on more concrete goals instead of promoting GNH when he took office,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/05/world/asia/index-of-happiness-bhutans-new-leader-prefers-more-concrete-goals.html|title=Index of Happiness? Bhutan’s New Leader Prefers More Concrete Goals|last1=Harris|first1=Gardiner|date=4 October 2013|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; but subsequently has protected the GNH of his country and promoted the concept internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/tshering_tobgay_this_country_isn_t_just_carbon_neutral_it_s_carbon_negative|first=Tshering | last=Tobgay | title=This country isn't just carbon neutral, it's carbon negative | publisher=[[TED (conference)|TED]] |date=2016|website=TED.com|access-date=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Bhutanese officials also promote the spread of GNH at the UN and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2015/10/511502-pursuit-happiness-fundamental-human-goal-minister-bhutan-tells-un-assembly|title=Pursuit of happiness is fundamental human goal,’ Minister of Bhutan tells UN Assembly|last=|first=|date=3 October 2015 | publisher=UN News |website=|access-date=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/world/asia/bhutan-gross-national-happiness-indicator-.html|title=In Bhutan, Happiness Index as Gauge for Social Ills|last=Schultz|first=Kai|date=17 January 2017|newspaper=New York Times|access-date=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== GNH Defined ==
GNH is distinguishable from [[Gross domestic product|Gross Domestic Product]] by valuing collective happiness as the goal of governance, by emphasizing harmony with nature and traditional values as expressed in the 9 domains of happiness and 4 pillars of GNH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/An%20Extensive%20Analysis%20of%20GNH%20Index.pdf|title=An Extensive Analysis of GNH Index|last1=Ura|first1=Karma|last2=Alkire|first2=Sabina|last3=Zangmo|first3=Tshoki|last4=Wangdi|first4=Karma|date=May 2012|publisher=The Centre for Bhutan Studies|location=Thimphu, Bhutan|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four pillars of GNH's are 1) [[Sustainable development|sustainable]] and [[Social development theory|equitable]] socio-economic development; 2) [[Environmental protection|environmental conservation]]; 3) preservation and promotion of culture; and 4) good governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tenth Five-Year Plan: 2008-2013|publisher=Gross National Happiness Commission - Royal Government of Bhutan, Actual Date of Publishing 25 June 2009 |location=Thimphu, Bhutan|url=http://www.gnhc.gov.bt/wp-content/uploads/2011/10thplan/TenthPlan_Vol1_Web.pdf|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nine domains of GNH are psychological well-being, health, time use, education, cultural diversity and resilience, good governance, community vitality, ecological diversity and resilience, and living standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ura|first1=Karma|date=2008|title=Understanding the Development Philosophy of Gross National Happiness|journal=Interview with Bhutan Broadcasting Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/|title=Welcome to the CBS's works on Gross National Happiness!|website=Gross National Happiness|publisher=www.grossnationalhappiness.com/|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each domain is composed of [[Survey methodology|subjective]] (survey-based) and objective indicators. The domains weigh equally but the indicators within each domain differ by weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ura|first=Karma|date=2012|title=A Short Guide to the Gross National Happiness Index|url=http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Short-GNH-Index-edited.pdf|journal=The Centre for Bhutan Studies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation of GNH in Bhutan==
The Gross National Happiness Commission is charged with implementing GNH in Bhutan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gnhc.gov.bt/en/|title=Gross National Happiness Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GNH Commission is composed of the Secretaries each of the ministries of the government, the Prime Minister, and the Secretary of the GNH Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gnhc.gov.bt/en/commission-members/|title=Commission Members|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The GNH Commission's tasks include conceiving and implementing the nation's 5-year plan and promulgating policies. The GNH Index is used to measure the happiness and well-being of Bhutan's population. A GNH Policy Screening Tool&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gnhcentrebhutan.org/what-is-gnh/gnh-screening-tool/|title=GNH Screening Tool|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a GNH Project Screening Tool is used by the GNH commission to determine whether to pass policies or implement projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/gnh-policy-and-project-screening-tools/|title=GNH Tools|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The GNH Screening tools used by the Bhutanese GNH Commission for anticipating the impact of policy initiatives upon the levels of GNH in Bhutan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pennock|first1=M|last2=Ura|first2=K|year=|title=Gross national happiness as a framework for health impact assessment|url=|journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review|volume=31|issue=|pages=61–65|doi=10.1016/j.eiar.2010.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the first GNH survey was conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/site/ssfc2011/48920513.pdf|title=The Gross National Happiness Index of Bhutan. Method and Illustrative Results|last=|first=|date=|website=OECD.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alkire|first=Sabina|date=November 2008|title=Bhutan’s Gross National Happiness Index : methodology and results|url=https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:fe52b6a2-94c7-4663-89aa-d09c19d32ab8|journal=Oxford Poverty &amp; Human Development Initiative (OPHI)|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by a second one in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/survey-results/index/|title=2010 Survey Results|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The third nationwide survey was conducted in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Final-GNH-Report-jp-21.3.17-ilovepdf-compressed.pdf|title=A Compass Towards A Just and Harmonious Society: 2015 GNH Survey Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GNH survey covers all twenty districts (Dzonkhag) and results are reported for varying demographic factors such as [[gender]], age, abode, and [[Job|occupation]].  The first GNH surveys consisted of long questionnaires that polled the citizens about living conditions and religious behavior, including questions about the times a person prayed in a day and other [[Karma]] indicators. It took several hours to complete one questionnaire. Later rounds of the GNH Index were shortened, but the survey retained the religious behavioral indicators.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Short-GNH-Index-edited.pdf||title=Short Guide to GNH Index}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bhutan GNH Index was developed by the [[Centre for Bhutan Studies]] with the help of the researchers from Oxford University researchers to help measure the progress of Bhutanese society. The Index function was based on Alkire &amp; Foster method of 2011.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ophi.org.uk/policy/national-policy/gross-national-happiness-index/|title=Bhutan’s Gross National Happiness Index|last=|first=|date=|website=Oxford Poverty and Human Development Index|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the creation of the national GNH Index, the government used the metric to measure national progress and inform policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adler|first=Alejandro|date=2009|title=Gross National Happiness in Bhutan: A Living Example of an Alternative Approach to Progress|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1003&amp;context=sire|journal=Social Impact Research Experience|volume=1|pages=1–137|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Musikanski|first=Laura|date=2014|title=Happiness in Public Policy|url=http://scholarworks.waldenu.edu/jsc/vol6/iss1/5/|journal=Walden University Journal of Social Change|volume=6|pages=55–85|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bhutan GNH Index is considered to measure societal progress similarly to other models such as the [[Gross National Well-being]] of 2005, the OECD [[Better Life Index]] of 2011, and SPI [[Social Progress Index]] of 2013. One distinguishing feature of Bhutan GNH Index from the other models is that the other models are designed for secular governments and do not include religious behavior measurement components.

The data is used to compare the happiness between different groups of [[Citizenship|citizens]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ophi.org.uk/policy/national-policy/gross-national-happiness-index/|title=Bhutan’s Gross National Happiness Index|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and changes over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/category/survey-report/|title=A Compass Towards a Just and Harmoneous Society: 2015 GNH Survey Report|date=2016|publisher=Centre for Bhutan Studies &amp; GNH Research|isbn=978-99936-14-86-9|location=Thimphu, Bhutan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread of GNH Outside of Bhutan==
In [[Victoria, British Columbia]], [[Canada]], a shortened version of Bhutan's GNH survey was used by the local government, local foundations and governmental agencies under the leadership of Martha and Michael Pennock to assess the population of Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://victoriafoundation.bc.ca/past-initiatives/happiness-index-partnership/|title=The Happiness Index Partnership|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2011-10-03/measuring-happiness-victoria-british-columbia|title=Measuring Happiness in Victoria, British Columbia|last=Chatterjee|first=Rhitu|date=3 October 2011|website=pri.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[University of Oregon]], United States, a behavioral model of GNH based on the use of positive and negative words in [[social network]] status updates was developed by Adam Kramer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kramer|first1=Adam|title=An unobtrusive behavioral model of "gross national happiness"|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1753326.1753369|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|pages=287–290|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Philippines]], the concept of GNH has been lauded by various personalities, notably Philippine senator and UN Global Champion for Resilience [[Loren Legarda]], and former environment minister [[Gina Lopez]]. Bills have been filed in the Philippine Senate and House of Representatives in support of Gross National Happiness in the Philippines. Additionally, Executive Director of Bhutan’s GNH Center, Dr. Saamdu Chetri, has been invited by high-level officials in the Philippines for a GNH Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/242511/242511/|title=How PH can have Gross National Happiness, too|first=Cathy|last=Cañares-Yamsuan|date=|website=inquirer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.mb.com.ph/2016/11/03/gross-national-happiness-for-ph-fvr-still-needed-malacanang/|title=Gross National Happiness for PH; FVR still needed – Malacañang|author=|date=|website=mb.com.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguidon.com/1112/main/2016/10/bhutan-happiness-guru-speaks-gross-national-happiness/|title=Bhutan ‘happiness guru’ speaks on ‘Gross National Happiness’|author=|date=23 October 2016|website=theguidon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other cities and governments have undertaken efforts to measure happiness and well-being (also termed "Beyond GDP"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fabriquespinoza.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/D5-2_BRAINPOoL_Final_Report-2.pdf|title=BRAINPOoL Final Report: Beyond GDP – From Measurement to Politics and Policy|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) since the High Level Meeting in 2012, but have not used versions of Bhutan's GNH index.

Gross National Happiness is also promoted in the United States by a nonprofit organization, [http://gnhusa.org/ Gross National Happiness USA].  Headquartered in Vermont, GNHUSA is a 501c(3) tax-exempt non-profit organization with a mission to increase personal happiness and the collective wellbeing by changing how the United States measure their progress and success. GNHUSA was founded after Linda Wheatley of Montpelier, Vermont, attended the 2008 Annual Gross National Happiness Research Conference in Thimphu, Bhutan. Wheatley returned to Vermont determined to introduce the little-known GNH concepts to the general public in the U.S. After establishing the nonprofit in the spring of 2009, representatives of the group attended the fifth international GNH research conference in Brazil in November 2009 and, in June 2010, hosted the first US-based conference on Gross National Happiness and other alternative indicators, at Champlain College in Burlington, Vermont. In May of 2012, GNHUSA with co-sponsors organized Measure What Matters, a conference building a collaborative of data experts in Vermont. The state of Vermont's Governor declared April 13th (President Jefferson’s birthday) “Pursuit of Happiness Day,” and became the first state to pass legislation enabling development of alternative indicators and to assist in making policy. GNHUSA collaborates with the Vermont Data Center to perform a [http://gnhusa.org/alternative-indicators/measuring-well-vermont-leads-way/ periodic study of well-being in the state], as a pilot for other states and municipalities. The organization also collaborates closely with the Happiness Alliance in collecting online GNH data, based on the domain of happiness developed by Bhutan.  In 2017, GNHUSA initiated the process of establishing chapters in all 50 states to work with local governments and institutions on well-being initiatives, beginning with Wisconsin and North Carolina. 
The organization also promotes the U.N.-designated International Happiness Day (March 20) as an opportunity to discuss the concepts of well-being with others at [http://gnhusa.org/happiness-dinners/ Happiness Dinners] across the country.

From August 25, 2012 to the present, GNHUSA has been carrying out a nationwide action research project, [http://gnhusa.org/serious-about-happiness/the-science-of-happiness-walking/ The Happiness Walk], carried out by GNHUSA board members and supporters. On the first leg, two GNHUSA board members walked 594 miles, from Vermont to Washington DC; the Walk most recently completed a leg from Santa Monica, CA to the Bay Area, with a side trip to Hawaii, and resumed March 1, 2018, walking from Petaluma CA to Seattle, Washington, on the 13th leg of the journey. Along the way, Walkers perform audio and video interviews and collect survey responses, introducing the concept of GNH and amassing data that will assist them in tailoring the GNH domains and indicators to American culture.
GNHUSA also posts and promotes a [http://gnhusa.org/charter-for-happiness/ Charter for Happiness] which, as of May 7, 2018, has 469 signatories.

==Criticism==

GNH has been described by critics as a [[propaganda]] tool used by the Bhutanese government to distract from [[Ethnic cleansing in Bhutan|ethnic cleansing]] and [[human rights in Bhutan|human rights abuses]] it has committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thapa|first1=Saurav Jung|title=Bhutan’s Hoax: of Gross National Happiness|work=Wave Magazine|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713000732/http://wavemag.com.np/issue/article3775.html|date=July 2011|archive-date=13 July 2011|url=http://wavemag.com.np/issue/article3775.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Vishal|last1=Arora|title=Bhutan’s Human Rights Record Defies ‘Happiness’ Claim|url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/04/bhutans-human-rights-record-defies-happiness-claim/|date=25 April 2014|work=The Diplomat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bhutanese democracy|Bhutanese democratic]] government began in 2008. Before that time the [[ethnic cleansing in Bhutan]] of non-Buddhist population of ethnic Nepalese of Hindu faith as a result of the GNH cultural preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/enigma-bhutan/|title=The Enigma of Bhutan|last=Bird|first=Kai|date=March 7, 2012|website=The Nation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/101east/2014/05/bhutan-forgotten-people-201452081049514496.html|title=Bhutan's Forgotten People|last=|first=|date=May 30, 2014|website=Aljazeera|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] [[Human Rights Watch]] documented the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/asia/bhutan|title=Bhutan|last=|first=|date=|website=Human Rights Watch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Human Rights Watch, "Over 100,000 or 1/6 of the population of Bhutan of Nepalese origin and [[Hindu]] faith were expelled from the country because they would not integrate with Bhutan’s [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] culture."&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/02/01/bhutans-ethnic-cleansing&lt;/ref&gt; The Refugee Council of Australia stated that "it is extraordinary and shocking that a nation can get away with expelling one sixth of its people and somehow keep its international reputation largely intact. The Government of Bhutan should be known not for Gross National Happiness but for Gross National [[Hypocrisy]]."&lt;ref&gt;The Australian Refugee Council https://www.refugeecouncil.org.au/media/time-to-challenge-bhutans-gross-national-hypocrisy/&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers state that Bhutan's GNH philosophy “has evolved over the last decade through the contribution of western and local scholars to a version that is more [[Democracy|democratic]] and open. Therefore, probably, the more accurate historical reference is to mention the coining of the GNH phrase as a key event, but not the Bhutan GNH philosophy, because the philosophy as understood by western scholars is different from the philosophy used by the King at the time.”&lt;ref&gt;The History of Gross National Happiness https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317151566_The_History_of_Gross_National_Happiness&lt;/ref&gt; Other viewpoints are that GNH is a process of development and learning, rather than an objective norm or absolute end point. Bhutan aspires to enhance the happiness of its people and GNH serves as a measurement tool for realizing that aspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Sander G. Tideman (2016), Gross National Happiness: Lessons for Sustainability Leadership South Asian Journal of Global Business Research, Vol. 5 Iss 2 pp. 190 – 213&lt;/ref&gt;

Other criticism focuses on the standard of living in Bhutan. In an article written in 2004 in the [[The Economist|Economist magazine]], “The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan is not in fact an idyll in a fairy tale. It is home to perhaps 900,000 people most of whom live in grinding poverty."&lt;ref&gt;The Economist Magazine http://www.economist.com/node/3445119&lt;/ref&gt;  Other criticism of GNH cites "increasing levels of [[political corruption]], the rapid spread of diseases such as [[HIV/AIDS|aids]] and [[tuberculosis]], [[Gang|gang violence]], abuses against women and ethnic minorities, shortages in food/medicine, and economic woes."&lt;ref&gt;The GSD Magazine https://www.gsdmagazine.org/the-false-promises-of-bhutans-gross-national-happiness/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://2008.bhutan-360.com/gross-national-happiness-happy-in-bhutan/|title=Gross National Happiness – Happy in Bhutan?|last=|first=|date=December 1, 2008|website=Bhutan, 2008 and Beyond|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic recombination caused by human activity has been occurring since around 12,000 BC, when humans first began to [[Domestication|domesticate]] organisms. [[Genetic engineering]] as the direct transfer of [[DNA]] from one organism to another was first accomplished by [[Herbert Boyer]] and [[Stanley Norman Cohen|Stanley Cohen]] in 1972. It was the result of a series of advancements in techniques that allowed the direct modification of the [[genome]]. Important advances included the discovery of [[Restriction enzyme|restriction enzymes]] and [[DNA ligase|DNA ligases]], the ability to design [[Plasmid|plasmids]] and technologies like [[polymerase chain reaction]] and [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]]. [[Transformation (genetics)|Transformation]] of the DNA into a host organism was accomplished with the invention of [[biolistics]], [[Agrobacterium#Uses in biotechnology|''Agrobacterium''-mediated recombination]] and [[microinjection]].

The first [[genetically modified animal]] was a [[Genetically modified mouse|mouse]] created in 1974 by [[Rudolf Jaenisch]]. In 1976 the technology was commercialised, with the advent of [[genetically modified bacteria]] that produced [[somatostatin]], followed by [[insulin]] in 1978. In 1983 an antibiotic resistant gene was inserted into tobacco, leading to the first [[Genetically modified plant|genetically engineered plant]]. Advances followed that allowed scientists to manipulate and add genes to a variety of different organisms and induce a range of different effects. Plants were first commercialized with virus resistant tobacco released in China in 1992. The first [[genetically modified food]] was the [[Flavr Savr]] tomato marketed in 1994. By 2010, 29 countries had planted commercialized biotech crops. In 2000 a paper published in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] introduced [[golden rice]], the first food developed with increased nutrient value.

The first evidence of plant domestication comes from [[emmer]] and [[einkorn wheat]] found in [[pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] villages in Southwest Asia dated about 10,500 to 10,100 BC.{{sfn|Zohary||Hopf|Weiss|p=1}}  The [[Fertile Crescent]] of Western Asia, [[Ancient Egyptian Agriculture|Egypt]], and [[History of agriculture in the Indian subcontinent|India]] were sites of the earliest planned sowing and harvesting of plants that had previously been gathered in the wild.

[[Charles Darwin]] described three types of selection: methodical selection, wherein humans deliberately select for particular characteristics; unconscious selection, wherein a characteristic is selected simply because it is desirable; and [[natural selection]], wherein a trait that helps an organism survive better is passed on.&lt;ref name=Kingsbury&gt;
Kingsbury, Noel (2009). [https://books.google.com/books?id=dGSj-CFxk-QC Hybrid: The History and Science of Plant Breeding]. University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0226437051}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}  Early breeding relied on unconscious and natural selection. The introduction of methodical selection is unknown.&lt;ref name=Kingsbury/&gt;{{rp|25}} Common characteristics that were bred into domesticated plants include grains that did not shatter to allow easier harvesting, uniform ripening, shorter lifespans that translate to faster growing, loss of toxic compounds, and productivity.&lt;ref name=Kingsbury/&gt;{{rp|27–30}} Some plants, like the Banana, were able to be propagated by [[vegetative cloning]]. Offspring often did not contain seeds, and therefore sterile. However, these offspring were usually juicier and larger. Propagation through cloning allows these mutant varieties to be cultivated despite their lack of seeds.&lt;ref name=Kingsbury/&gt;{{rp|31}}

Hybridization was another way that rapid changes in plant's makeup were introduced. It often increased vigor in plants, and combined desirable traits together. Hybridization most likely first occurred when humans first grew similar, yet slightly different plants in close proximity.&lt;ref name=Kingsbury/&gt;{{rp|32}} [[Triticum aestivum]], wheat used in baking bread, is an [[allopolyploid]]. Its creation is the result of two separate hybridization events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wheatbp.net/WheatBP/Documents/DOC_Evolution.php|title=Evolution of Wheatpublisher=Wheat, the big picture|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128092033/http://www.wheatbp.net/WheatBP/Documents/DOC_Evolution.php|archivedate=2013-01-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grafting]] can transfer [[chloroplast]]s (specialised DNA in plants that can conduct [[photosynthesis]]), [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitichondrial DNA]] and the entire [[cell nucleus]] containing the [[genome]] to potentially make a new species making grafting a form of natural genetic engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2079813-farmers-may-have-been-accidentally-making-gmos-for-millennia/|title=Farmers may have been accidentally making GMOs for millennia|last=Le Page|first=Michael|date=2016-03-17|website=|publisher=The New Scientist|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

X-rays were first used to deliberately mutate plants in 1927. Between 1927 and 2007, more than 2,540 genetically mutated plant varieties had been produced using x-rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schouten | first1 = H.

{{Main|History of genetics}}
[[File:Griffith experiment.svg|thumb|300px|right|[[Griffith's experiment|Griffith]] proved the existence of a "transforming principle", which [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment|Avery, MacLeod and McCarty]] later showed to be [[DNA]]]]
[[File:Agrobacterium-tumefaciens.png|thumb|right|The bacterium ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]'' inserts [[T-DNA]] into infected plant cells, which is then incorporated into the plants [[genome]].]]Various genetic discoveries have been essential in the development of genetic engineering. [[Mendelian inheritance|Genetic inheritance]] was first discovered by [[Gregor Mendel]] in 1865 following experiments crossing peas. Although largely ignored for 34 years he provided the first evidence of hereditary segregation and independent assortment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Genetics|year=1992|volume=131|issue=2|pages=245–25|title=What Did Gregor Mendel Think He Discovered?|author1=Hartl, D. L. |author2=Orel, V. |pmc=1205000|pmid=1644269}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889 [[Hugo de Vries]] came up with the name "(pan)gene" after postulating that particles are responsible for inheritance of characteristics&lt;ref name="pangen"&gt;Vries, H. de (1889) ''Intracellular Pangenesis'' [http://www.esp.org/books/devries/pangenesis/facsimile/] ("pan-gene" definition on page 7 and 40 of this 1910 translation in English)&lt;/ref&gt; and the term "genetics" was coined by [[William Bateson]] in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jic.ac.uk/corporate/about/bateson.htm|title=The Bateson Lecture|author=Creative Sponge|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013020831/http://www.jic.ac.uk/corporate/about/bateson.htm|archivedate=2007-10-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 [[Frederick Griffith]] [[Griffith's experiment|proved]] the existence of a "transforming principle" involved in inheritance, which [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment|Avery, MacLeod and McCarty]] later (1944) identified as [[DNA]]. [[Edward Lawrie Tatum]] and [[George Wells Beadle]] developed the [[central dogma of genetics|central dogma]] that genes code for proteins in 1941. The [[double helix]] structure of DNA was identified by [[James D. Watson|James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] in 1953.

As well as discovering how DNA works, tools had to be developed that allowed it to be manipulated. In 1970 [[Hamilton O. Smith|Hamilton Smith's]] lab discovered [[restriction enzymes]] that allowed DNA to be cut at specific places and separated out on an [[electrophoresis gel]]. This enabled scientists to isolate genes from an organism's genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = R.

[[Frederick Sanger]] developed a method for sequencing DNA in 1977, greatly increasing the genetic information available to researchers. [[Polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), developed by [[Kary Mullis]] in 1983, allowed small sections of DNA to be amplified and aided identification and isolation of genetic material.

As well as manipulating the DNA, techniques had to be developed for its insertion (known as [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]]) into an organism's genome. Griffiths experiment had already shown that some bacteria had [[natural competence|the ability to naturally take up and express foreign DNA]]. Artificial competence was induced in ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' in 1970 when [[Morton Mandel]] and [[Akiko Higa]] showed that it could take up [[Lambda phage|bacteriophage λ]] after treatment with calcium chloride solution (CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(70)90051-3 |title = Calcium-dependent bacteriophage DNA infection | last = Mandel | first = Morton |author2=Higa, Akiko  | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | year= 1970| volume = 53 |issue = 1 |pages = 15962|pmid = 4922220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Stanley Cohen showed that CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; treatment was also effective for uptake of plasmid DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.69.8.2110| title = Non chromosomal Antibiotic Resistance in Bacteria: Genetic Transformation of Escherichia coli by R-Factor DNA| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume = 69| issue = 8| pages = 2110–14| year = 1972| last1 = Cohen | first1 = S.

==Early genetically modified organisms==
[[File:Paul Berg in 1980.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Berg]] created the first [[recombinant DNA]] molecules in 1972.]]
In 1972 [[Paul Berg]] used restriction enzymes and DNA ligases to create the first [[recombinant DNA]] molecules. He combined DNA from the  monkey virus [[SV40]] with that of the [[Lambda phage|lambda virus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.69.10.2904| title = Biochemical Method for Inserting New Genetic Information into DNA of Simian Virus 40: Circular SV40 DNA Molecules Containing Lambda Phage Genes and the Galactose Operon of Escherichia coli| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume = 69| issue = 10| pages = 2904–09| year = 1972| last1 = Jackson | first1 = D.

Cohen was researching plasmids, while Boyers work involved restriction enzymes. They recognised the complementary nature of their work and teamed up in 1972. Together they found a restriction enzyme that cut the [[pSC101]] plasmid at a single point and were able to insert and ligate a gene that conferred resistance to the [[kanamycin]] antibiotic into the gap. Cohen had previously devised a method where bacteria could be induced to take up a plasmid and using this they were able to create a bacteria that survived in the presence of the kanamycin. This represented the first genetically modified organism. They repeated experiments showing that other genes could be expressed in bacteria, including one from the toad [[Xenopus laevis]], the first cross kingdom transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/resources/timeline/1973_Boyer.php|title=Genome and genetics timeline – 1973|publisher=Genome news network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Genetics: Genetic Engineering Timeline|last=Arnold|first=Paul|year=2009|url=http://www.brighthub.com/science/genetics/articles/21983.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Cohen, Stanley N. |author2=Chang, Annie C.

==Regulation==
{{Main|Regulation of genetic engineering}}
The development of genetic engineering technology led to concerns in the scientific community about potential risks. The development of a regulatory framework concerning genetic engineering began in 1975, at [[Asilomar Conference Grounds|Asilomar]], California. The [[Asilomar conference on recombinant DNA|Asilomar meeting]] recommended a set of guidelines regarding the cautious use of recombinant technology and any products resulting from that technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.72.6.1981| title = Summary statement of the Asilomar conference on recombinant DNA molecules| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume = 72| issue = 6| pages = 1981–84| year = 1975| last1 = Berg | first1 = P.| last2 = Baltimore | first2 = D.| last3 = Brenner | first3 = S.| last4 = Roblin | first4 = R.

In 2010 scientists at the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]] announced that they had created the first synthetic bacterial [[genome]]. The researchers added the new genome to bacterial cells and selected for cells that contained the new genome. To do this the cells undergoes a process called resolution, where during bacterial cell division one new cell receives the original DNA genome of the bacteria, whilst the other receives the new synthetic genome. When this cell replicates it uses the synthetic genome as its template. The resulting bacterium the researchers developed, named [[Synthia]], was the world's first [[synthetic life]] form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1190719 |title=Creation of a Bacterial Cell Controlled by a Chemically Synthesized Genome |year=2010 |last1=Gibson |first1=D.

In 2014 a bacteria was developed that replicated a [[plasmid]] containing an unnatural [[base pair]]. This required altering the bacterium so it could import the unnatural [[nucleotides]] and then efficiently replicate them. The plasmid retained the unnatural base pairs when it doubled an estimated 99.4% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In 2015 [[CRISPR]] and [[TALENs]] was used to modify plant genomes. Chinese labs used it to create a fungus-resistant wheat and boost rice yields, while a U.K. group used it to tweak a barley gene that could help produce drought-resistant varieties. When used to precisely remove material from DNA without adding genes from other species, the result is not subject the lengthy and expensive regulatory process associated with GMOs. While CRISPR may use foreign DNA to aid the editing process, the second generation of edited plants contain none of that DNA. Researchers celebrated the acceleration because it may allow them to "keep up" with rapidly evolving pathogens. The U.S. Department of Agriculture stated that some examples of gene-edited corn, potatoes and soybeans are not subject to existing regulations. As of 2016 other review bodies had yet to make statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/600765/10-breakthrough-technologies-2016-precise-gene-editing-in-plants/|title=10 Breakthrough Technologies 2016: Precise Gene Editing in Plants|website=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2016-03-08 |date=March 2016 |first=David |last=Talbot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Multitrack recording]] of sound is the process in which sound and other electro-acoustic signals are captured on a recording medium such as [[magnetic tape]], which is divided into two or more audio tracks that run parallel with each other. Because they are carried on the same medium, the tracks stay in perfect synchronisation, while allowing multiple sound sources to be recorded asynchronously. The first system for creating [[stereophonic sound]] (using [[telephone]] technology) was demonstrated by [[Clément Ader]] in Paris in 1881. The [[pallophotophone]], invented by [[Charles A. Hoxie]] and first demonstrated in 1922, recorded optically on 35&amp;nbsp;mm film, and some versions used a format of as many as twelve tracks in parallel on each strip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gereports.com/edison-speaks-cracking-the-pallophotophone-code/ Edison speaks! Cracking the pallophotophone code | GE Reports&lt;!-- bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The tracks were recorded one at a time in separate passes and were not intended for later [[Audio mixing|mixdown]] or stereophony; as with later half-track and quarter-track monophonic tape recording, the multiple tracks simply multiplied the maximum recording time possible, greatly reducing cost and bulk. British [[EMI]] engineer [[Alan Blumlein]] patented systems for recording stereophonic sound and [[surround sound]] on disc and film in 1933. The history of modern multitrack audio recording using magnetic tape began in 1943 with the invention of [[stereo]] tape recording, which divided the recording head into two tracks.

The next major development in multitrack recording came in the mid-1950s, when the [[Ampex]] corporation devised the concept of 8-track recording, utilizing its "Sel-Sync" (Selective Synchronous) recording system, and sold the first such machine to musician [[Les Paul]]&lt;ref name="snyder"&gt;[http://aes-media.org/historical/pdf/snyder_sel-sync.pdf ARSC Journal, Sel-sync and the "Octopus": How Came to be the First Recorder to Minimize Successive Copying in Overdubs]&lt;/ref&gt;. However, for the next 35 years, multitrack audio recording technology was largely confined to specialist radio, TV and music recording studios, primarily because multitrack tape machines were both very large and very expensive - the first Ampex 8-track recorder, installed in Les Paul's home studio in 1957, cost a princely US$10,000 - roughly three times the [[Average Indexed Monthly Earnings#Indexing yearly income|US average yearly income]] in 1957, and equivalent to around $90,000 in 2016. However, this situation changed radically in 1979 with the introduction of the TASCAM [[Portastudio]], which used the inexpensive [[compact audio cassette]] as the recording medium, making good-quality 4-track (and later 8-track) multitrack recording available to the average consumer for the first time. Ironically, by the time the Portastudio had become popular, electronics companies were already introducing digital audio recording systems, and by the 1990s, computer-based digital multitrack recording systems such as [[Pro Tools]] and [[Cubase]] were being adopted by the recording industry, and soon became standard. By the early 2000s, rapid advances in home computing and digital audio software were making digital multitrack audio recording systems available to the average consumer, and high-quality digital multitrack recording systems like [[GarageBand]] were being included as a standard feature on home computers.

==Overview==
Stereo sound recording on tape was perfected in 1943 by German audio engineers working for the [[AEG]] corporation. Around 250 stereo tape recordings were made during this period (of which only three have survived), but the technology remained a closely guarded secret within Germany until the end of World War II. After the war, American audio engineer [[John T. Mullin]] and the [[Ampex]] corporation pioneered the commercial development of tape recording in the USA, and the technology was rapidly taken up by radio and the music industry due to its superior sound fidelity and because tape - being a linear recording medium - could be easily edited, by physically cutting and splicing the tape, to remove unwanted elements and create a 'perfect' recording. 2-track tape recording was rapidly adopted for modern music in the 1950s because it enabled signals from two or more separate microphones to be recorded simultaneously, enabling stereophonic recordings to be made and edited conveniently, which in turn facilitated the rapid expansion of the consumer high-fidelity ("HiFi") market. Stereo (either true binaural two-microphone stereo or multimixed) quickly became the norm for commercial classical recordings and radio broadcasts, although many pop music and jazz  recordings continued to be issued in monophonic sound until the late 1960s.

Much of the credit for the development of multitrack recording goes to guitarist, composer and technician [[Les Paul]], who lent his name to Gibson's first solid-body electric guitar. His experiments with tapes and recorders in the early 1950s led him to order the first custom-built eight-track recorder from Ampex, and his pioneering recordings with his then wife, singer [[Mary Ford]]. But it was [[Patti Page]] who was the first vocalist to record her own voice, sound on sound, with a song called [[Confess_(song)|'Confess']], in 1947: Bill Putnam, an engineer for Mercury Records, was able to overdub Page's voice, due to his well-known use of technology. Thus, Page became the first pop artist to overdub her vocals on a song. This was months before [[Les Paul]] and [[Mary Ford]] had their first multi-voiced release. Paul was the first to make use of the technique of multitracking to record separate elements of a musical piece asynchronously — that is, separate elements could be recorded at different times. Paul's technique enabled him to listen to the tracks he had already taped and record new parts in time alongside them. In 1963, solo jazz pianist, Bill Evans, recorded [[Conversations with Myself (album)|Conversations with Myself]], an innovative solo album using the unconventional (in jazz solo recordings) technique of overdubbing over himself, in effect creating a two-piano duet of jazz improvisations.

Despite [[Ampex]] having created the first 8-track tape machines for [[Les Paul]] and [[Atlantic Records]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/Remembering_Ahmet_Ertegun_and_Atlantics_Early_Years |title=Remembering Ahmet Ertegun and Atlantic’s Early Years |publisher=BMI|date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;, multitrack recording was taken up in a more limited way in the industry via 3-track recorders. These proved extremely useful for popular music, since they enabled backing music to be recorded on two tracks (either to allow the overdubbing of separate parts, or to create a full stereo backing track) while the third track was reserved for the lead vocalist. Three-track recorders remained in widespread commercial use until the mid-1960s and many famous pop recordings — including many of [[Phil Spector]]'s so-called "Wall of Sound" productions and early [[Motown]] hits — were taped on 3-track recorders.

The next evolution was 4-track recording, which was the studio standard through the mid 1960s. Many of the most famous recordings by [[The Beatles]] and [[The Rolling Stones]] were recorded on 4-track, and the engineers at London's [[Abbey Road Studios]] became particularly adept at the technique called "reduction mixes" in the UK and "bouncing down" in the United States, in which multiple tracks were recorded onto one 4-track machine and then mixed together and transferred (bounced down) to one track of a second 4-track machine. In this way, it was possible to record literally dozens of separate tracks and combine them into finished recordings of great complexity.

By the mid-1960s, the ready availability of the most up-to-date multitrack recorders - which were by then standard equipment in the leading Los Angeles recording studios - enabled [[Brian Wilson]] of [[The Beach Boys]] to become one of the first pop producers to exploit the huge potential of multitrack recording. During the group's most innovative period of music-making, from 1964 to 1967, Wilson developed elaborate techniques for assembling the band's songs, which combined elements captured on both 4-track and 8-track recorders, as well as making extensive use of tape editing. By 1964, Wilson's increasingly complex arrangements had far outstripped the group's limited musical abilities - singer-guitarist [[Carl Wilson]] was the only group member who regularly contributed to these tracking sessions - so Wilson began routinely recording all the instrumental backing tracks for his songs using the team of top-rank professional studio musicians who came to be known as "[[The Wrecking Crew (music)|The Wrecking Crew]]". For the group's landmark ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' album in 1965, Wilson recorded all the album's elaborate backing tracks using The Wrecking Crew and other session musicians, while the Beach Boys were away touring; the session musicians typically performed these instrumental tracks as ensemble performances, which were recorded and mixed live, direct to a 4-track recorder. When the other Beach Boys returned from touring, they moved to Columbia's Hollywood studio, which was equipped with the latest 8-track technology; by this time, Wilson and his engineers had 'reduced' the pre-recorded 4-track backing tracks to a mono mix, which was then dubbed onto one track of the 8-track master tape; Wilson then recorded the vocal tracks, assigning one individual track to each of the six vocalists (including soon-to-be permanent member [[Bruce Johnston]]), leaving the eighth track available for final 'sweetening' elements, such as additional vocal or instrumental touches, and lastly, all these elements were mixed down to the mono master tape. Nearly all of the Beach Boys' 4-track and 8-track masters from this period are preserved in Capitol's archive, allowing the label to release several expansive boxed sets of this music; ''[[The Pet Sounds Sessions]]'' (1997), includes nearly all the separate backing and vocal tracks from the album, as well as new stereo mixes of all the songs, while the 9-CD ''[[The Smile Sessions]]'' (2011) features a wide cross-section of the huge amount of instrumental and vocal material (totalling around 50 hours of recordings) that was recorded for the group's never-completed 1967 ''magnum opus'', ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]''.

All of the Beatles classic mid-1960s recordings, including the albums ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' and ''[[Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', were recorded in this way. There were limitations, however, because of the build-up of noise during the bouncing-down process, and the Abbey Road engineers are still justly famed for the ability to create dense multitrack recordings while keeping background noise to a minimum.

4-track tape also led to a related development, [[quadraphonic]] sound, in which each of the four tracks was used to simulate a complete 360-degree surround sound. A number of albums including Pink Floyd's ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' and Mike Oldfield's ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' were released both in stereo and quadrophonic format in the 1970s, but 'quad' failed to gain wide commercial acceptance. Although it is now sometimes considered a gimmick, it was the direct precursor of the [[surround sound]] technology that has become standard in many modern home theater systems.

In a [[professional audio]] setting today, such as a [[recording studio]], [[audio engineer]]s may use 64 tracks or more for their recordings, utilizing one or more tracks for each instrument played.

The combination of the ability to edit via tape splicing, and the ability to record multiple tracks, revolutionized studio recording. It became common studio recording practice to record on multiple tracks, and mix down afterward. The convenience of tape editing and multitrack recording led to the rapid adoption of [[magnetic tape]] as the primary technology for commercial musical recordings. Although 33⅓ rpm and 45 rpm vinyl records were the dominant consumer format, recordings were customarily made first on [[magnetic tape]], then transferred to disc, with [[Bing Crosby]] leading the way in the adoption of this method in the United States.

== Ampex's original 8-track recorder ==

The original Ampex 8-track recorder (not to be confused with [[8-track tape]] endless-loop cartridge players), model 5258, was an internal Ampex project.  It was based on an Ampex 1" data recorder transport with modified Ampex model 350 electronics.  It stood over {{convert|7|ft|m}} tall and weighed {{convert|250|lb|kg}}.  8 tracks were chosen because that was the number of {{convert|0.070|in|mm}} recording tracks with {{convert|0.060|in|mm}} guard tracks that would fit on a {{convert|1|in|mm}} recording tape, the widest tape available at the time.&lt;ref name="snyder" /&gt;

The first of the Ampex 8-track recorders was sold to [[Les Paul]] for $10,000 in 1957 and was installed in his home recording studio by [[David Sarser]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reevesaudio.com/studiothree.html Studio 3: A Place of Recording Studio History...]&lt;/ref&gt;  It became known as the "Octopus".

The second Ampex model 5258 8-track was sold to [[Atlantic Records]] at [[Tom Dowd|Tom Dowd's]] insistence in late 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/30/arts/tom-dowd-77-an-innovator-in-the-art-of-recording-music.html | work=The New York Times | first=Jon | last=Pareles | title=Tom Dowd, 77, an Innovator In the Art of Recording Music | date=October 30, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlantic was the first record company to use a multi-track (as opposed to stereo or 3-track) recorder in their studio.

== Multi-channel recorders ==

Multi-track recording differs from [[overdubbing]] and sound on sound because it records separate signals to individual tracks.  Sound on sound which Les Paul invented adds a new performance to an existing recording by placing a second playback head in front of the erase head to play back the existing track before erasing it and re-recording a new track.

Multi-track recorders also differ from early stereo and three track recorders that were available at the time in that they can record individual tracks while preserving the other tracks.  The original multi-channel recorders could only record all tracks at once.

The earliest multitrack recorders were analog magnetic tape machines with two or three tracks. [[Elvis Presley]] was first recorded on multitrack during 1957, as [[RCA]]'s engineers were testing their new machines. [[Buddy Holly]]'s last studio session in 1958 employed three-track, resulting in his only stereo releases not to include overdubs. The new three-track system allowed the lead vocal to be recorded on a dedicated track, while the remaining two tracks could be used to record the backing tracks in full stereo.

== Other early multi-track recorders ==

[[Frank Zappa]] experimented in the early 1960s with a custom built 5-track recorder built by engineer Paul Buff in his [[Pal Recording Studio]] in [[Rancho Cucamonga, California]]. Buff later went on to work in larger Hollywood studios. However, recorders with four or more tracks were restricted mainly to major American recording studios until the mid-to-late 1960s, mainly because of import restrictions and the high cost of the technology. In England, pioneering independent producer [[Joe Meek]] produced all of his innovative early 1960s recordings using monophonic and two-track recorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cleveland|first1=Barry|title=Joe Meek's Bold Techniques|date=2013|publisher=ElevenEleven|isbn=978-0-615-73600-6|pages=121|edition=Second|url=http://www.barrycleveland.com/jm-about/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Meek, [[EMI]] house producer [[George Martin]] was considered an innovator for his use of two-track as a means to making better mono records, carefully balancing vocals and instruments; [[Abbey Road Studios]] installed Telefunken four-track machines in 1959 and 1960 (replaced in 1965 by smaller, more durable Studer machines), but [[The Beatles]] would not have access to them until late 1963, and all recordings prior to their first world hit single ''[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]'' (1964) were made on two-track machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Recording The Beatles |last= Kehew |first= Brian |publisher= Curvebender Publishing |author2=Kevin Ryan |pages= 216 |year= 2006 |isbn= 0-9785200-0-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on popular music==

The artistic potential of the multitrack recorder came to the attention of the public in the 1960s, when artists such as [[the Beatles]] and [[the Beach Boys]] began to multitrack extensively, and from then on virtually all popular music was recorded in this manner. The technology developed very rapidly during these years. At the start of their careers, the Beatles and Beach Boys each recorded live to mono, two-track (the Beatles), or three-track (the Beach Boys); by 1965 they used multitracking to create pop music of unprecedented complexity.

The Beach Boys' acclaimed 1966 LP ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' relied on multitrack recorders for its innovative production. [[Brian Wilson]] pretaped all the instrumental backing tracks with a large ensemble, recording the performances live, direct to a four-track recorder. These four-track backing tapes were then '[[overdubbing|dubbed down]]' to one track of an eight-track tape. Six of the remaining seven tracks were then used to individually record the vocals of each member of The Beach Boys, and the eighth track was reserved for any final 'sweetening' overdubs of instruments or voices.

[[3M]] introduced the 1-inch eight-track version of their model M-23 recorder in 1966, probably the first mass-produced machine of this format.  It remained in production until 1970 and was used by many top studios worldwide including Abbey Road Studios in London.  Both [[Pete Townshend]] and [[John Lennon]] had 3M 8-track machines in their home [[project studio]]s c. 1969-1970.  Ampex began mass production of their competing 1-inch eight-track MM1000 in 1967.  One of the first 8-track machines in Los Angeles was built by [[Scully Recording Instruments]] of Bridgeport, Connecticut and installed at American Recorders in late 1967.  The [[Steppenwolf (Steppenwolf album)|debut album]] by [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] was recorded there and was released in January 1968.

Because The Beatles did not gain access to eight-track recorders until 1968, their groundbreaking ''[[Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' LP (1967) was created using pairs of four-track machines; the group also used [[vari-speed]] (also called [[pitch shift]]) to achieve unique sounds, and they were the first group in the world to use an important offshoot of multitrack recording, the [[Automatic Double Tracking]] (ADT) system invented by Abbey Road staff engineer [[Ken Townsend]] in 1966.

Other artists began experimenting with multitrack's possibilities also, with [[the Music Machine]] (of "Talk Talk" fame) recording on a custom-built ten-track setup, and [[Pink Floyd]] collaborating with former Beatles [[recording engineer]] [[Norman Smith (record producer)|Norman "Hurricane" Smith]], who produced their first albums.

The first eight-track recorder in the UK was built by Scully and installed at London's [[Advision Studios]] in early 1968.  Among the first eight-track recordings made there were the single ''[[Dogs (The Who song)|Dogs]]'' by [[The Who]] and the album ''[[My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair... But Now They're Content to Wear Stars on Their Brows]]'' by the band [[T. Rex (band)|Tyrannosaurus Rex]].  [[Trident Studios]] obtained their first eight-track recorder soon afterward.  It was during The Beatles' recording of their ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]'' sessions of late 1968 that [[EMI]]'s [[Abbey Road Studios]] finally had eight-track recorders installed, until then the group went to Trident to record with eight-tracks.  The Beatles used eight-track to record portions of  the ''White Album'', the single "[[Hey Jude]]" and the later ''[[Abbey Road]]''.

Other western countries also lagged well behind the USA – in [[Australia]], the largest local recording label, [[Festival Records (Australia)|Festival Records]], did not install a four-track recorder until late 1966; the first eight-track recorders did not appear there until the late 1960s.

==Large format analog recorders==

In 1967 [[Ampex]] built its first prototype 16-track [[professional audio]] recorder at the request of Mirasound Studios in New York City.  This machine used reels of 2-inch tape on a modified tape transport system originally built  for video recording.  In 1968 it introduced the 16-track production model MM-1000, the first commercially available 16-track machine.  Machines of this size are difficult to move and costly to maintain.  Prices were very high, typically $10,000 to $30,000 U.S. dollars.

One of the first 16-track recorders was installed at CBS Studios in [[New York City]] where it was used to record the second album by ''[[Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears (Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears album)|Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears]]'' released in December 1968.  The [[Grateful Dead]] released their first 16-track recordings ''[[Aoxomoxoa]]'' in June 1969 and ''[[Live/Dead]]'' in November 1969.  TTG Studios in [[Los Angeles]] built its own 16-track machine in 1968.  This was used on [[Frank Zappa]]'s album ''[[Hot Rats]]'' released in October 1969. ''[[Volunteers (Jefferson Airplane album)|Volunteers]]'' by [[Jefferson Airplane]] was released in November 1969. The back of the Jefferson Airplane album cover includes a picture of the 16-track MM-1000.

Advision and Trident were also among the first in the U.K. to install 16-track machines.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  Trident installed its first 16-track machine in late 1969. "After The Flood", a song from the [[Van der Graaf Generator]] album ''[[The Least We Can Do Is Wave To Each Other]]'', was recorded at this studio on 16 tracks in December 1969. Production of 16-track machines boomed and the number of studios worldwide using these machines exploded during 1970 and 1971.  By the end of 1971 there were at least 21 studios in London using 16-track recorders in conjunction with [[Dolby]] noise reduction.&lt;ref&gt;"Spotlight on London" Billboard Magazine, November 13, 1971 - advertisement, pg. L-26&lt;/ref&gt; Groups using Trident at this time also included [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[David Bowie]] as well as [[Queen (band)|Queen]] who experimented with multitracking extensively most prominently on their albums [[Queen II]] and ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]''.

Australia's first sixteen-track recorder was installed at [[Armstrong's Studios]] in [[Melbourne]] in 1971; Festival installed Australia's first 24-track recorder at its Sydney studio in 1974.  During the 1970s, sixteen, twenty-four, and thirty-two tracks became common in professional studios, with recording tape reaching two and three inches (5.08&amp;nbsp;cm - 7.62&amp;nbsp;cm) wide.  The so-called "golden age" of large format professional analog recorders would last into the 1990s when the technology was mostly replaced with digital tape machines, and later on, computer systems using [[hard disk drive]]s instead of tape.  Some music producers and musicians still prefer working with the sound of vintage analog recording equipment despite the additional costs and difficulties involved.

Large format analog multitrack machines can have up to 24 tracks on a tape two inches wide which is the widest analog tape that is generally available. Prototype machines, by [[Music Center Incorporated|MCI]] in 1978, using 3" tape for 32 tracks never went into production, though [[Otari Incorporated|Otari]] made a 32 track 2" MX-80.  A few studios still operate large format analog recorders, though much of the time their use is only to copy sounds onto a modern digital format.  Maintaining these machines has become increasingly difficult as new parts are rarely available.  New tape is still available but prices have risen significantly in recent years.

[[File:TEAC 2340.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[TEAC Corporation|TEAC]] 2340, a popular early (1973) home multitrack recorder, four tracks on ¼ inch tape.]]

==Home systems==

In 1972 [[TEAC Corporation|TEAC]] marketed their consumer 4-channel [[quadraphonic]] tape recorders for use as home multitrack recorders.  The result were the popular TEAC 2340 and 3340 models.  Both used ¼ inch tape.  The 2340 ran at either 3¾ or 7½ inches per second and used 7-inch reels while the 3340 ran at 7½ or 15&amp;nbsp;inches per second and used 10½ inch reels.  The 2340 was priced at under U.S. $1,000 making it very popular for home use.

The advent of the [[compact audio cassette]] (developed in 1963) ultimately led to affordable, portable four-track machines such as the [[Tascam]] [[Portastudio]] which debuted in 1979. Cassette-based machines could not provide the same audio quality as [[reel-to-reel]] machines, but served as a useful tool for professional and semi-pro musicians in making [[demo (music)|song demos]]. The Portastudio had a revolutionary effect on the emerging [[punk rock]] genre, because it enabled young bands to make recordings without signing to a [[record label]]. In the early years of punk, many bands self-produced their own recordings and sold them at gigs and by putting advertisements in underground [[zine]]s. [[Bruce Springsteen|Bruce Springsteen's]] 1982 album ''[[Nebraska (album)|Nebraska]]'' was made this way, with Springsteen choosing the album's earlier demo versions over the later studio recordings.

The familiar tape cassette was designed to accommodate four channels of audio – in a commercially recorded cassette these four tracks would normally constitute the stereo channels (each consisting of two tracks) for both 'sides' of the cassette – in a four-track cassette recorder all four tracks of a cassette are utilized together, often with the tape running at twice the normal speed (3¾ instead of 1⅞ inches per second) for increased fidelity. A separate signal can be recorded on to each of four tracks. (As such, the four-track machine does not utilize the two separate sides of the cassette in the conventional sense; if the cassette is inserted the other way round, all four tracks play in reverse.) As with professional machines, two or more tracks can be bounced down to one. When recording is complete, the volume level of each track is optimized, [[effect unit|electronic effects]] such as [[reverb]] are added to certain tracks where desired, each track is separately 'panned' to the desired point in the stereo field and the resulting stereo signal is mixed down to a separate stereo machine (such as a conventional cassette recorder).

==Digital multitracking==

By the early 1970s, Thomas Stockham of Sound Stream Digital, created the first practical use of [[pulse code modulation]], also called PCM [[digital recording]], for [[high fidelity]] purposes. The first to be released were rereleased cleaned up versions of acoustic recordings made by the great tenor, [[Enrico Caruso]]. Early computer algorithms were used in the process of cleaning up the scratchy old 78 RPM records. The process could not be done in "real time" as the early computers were not very powerful or fast, compared to 2010-era computers. All of the data had to be stored on linear digital tape and then played back, in real time. The actual ingest from the 78 RPM records to the digital tape was also done in real-time. The computer processing to clean up the surface noise, pops and scratches took the early computers quite some time to process.

By the late 1970s, [[3M]] introduced the first digital multi-track recorder. It utilized 1-inch wide tape and recorded 32 tracks. Unlike analog tape, edits could not be accomplished with a grease pencil, razor blades and splicing tape. So a secondary 4 track editing &amp; mix down recorder was also created with an electronically-controlled edit controller to make effective digital edits. This early system used a 16-bit digital "word". The only converters of the day were 12 bit &amp; 4 bit. So two were cascaded/daisy-chained to create the necessary 16-bit "word" for 96 DB of dynamic range. The signal was then sampled faster than any other digital recordings made up until that time at 50,000 times per second (50&amp;nbsp;kHz). It was known to be the best sounding{{Disputed inline|Talk page section|date=April 2018}} of all the later digital multi-track recorders because their use of 50&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling did not become the industry standards later established as 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz for CD's &amp; 48&amp;nbsp;kHz for digital video.

The accepted world standard was created by [[Sony]] along with Philips. Sony created a 24 track digital recorder and [[Mitsubishi Corporation]] created a different 32 track digital recorder. The Mitsubishi recorded their data differently and it could be edited, the old-fashioned analog way, with a razor blade and splicing tape. The Sony used 1/2 inch tape whereas the Mitsubishi used 1 inch wide tape. So the first recordings that were released produced on the 3M, 32 track digital recorder were still analog vinyl releases, since the CD had yet to be invented. These professional linear tape digital recorders established the "DASH" format meaning, " Digital Audio Stationary Head". By the time the other manufacturers released their digital multi-track recorders, the CD had already been developed. The sampling rate dictates the upper range of the frequency response, whereas the bit depth dictates the [[dynamic range]] and [[signal to noise ratio]]s.

Starting in 1992, the ALESIS Corporation, a company which made digital [[drum machine]]s and inexpensive analog [[audio mixer]]s introduced the first multitrack, eight track, project studio, digital 8 track machine. It was named the ADAT, after the earlier 2 track digital recorders of the time known as DAT (Digital Audio Tape), which were based upon a small spinning head, similar to a consumer video recorder. The ADAT machine recorded its data in an already well-established consumer format based on VHS videotape recorder technology. Eight separate data tracks were recorded within the same bandwidth it took to record a TV show on a home video recorder (VHS). Numerous machines could be electronically locked together with a single cable. You could plug in enough 8 track machines together to create one giant 128 track machine. And like the professional studio recorders before it, a large full function [[remote control]] was also available.

The following year, the TEAC/TASCAM Corporation, introduced their DA-88. Those used the smaller 8&amp;nbsp;mm video format tapes. Those recorded four duplexed pairs of data tracks and would require a "read before write" function for [[overdubbing]] purposes of adjacent tracks. A full size remote and remote metering was also made available. Later units introduced by both companies provided for higher bit depths such as 20 &amp; 24 bit. These machines like the early home studio TEAC's before them, slashed the prices of professional digital multitrack recording. It changed the recording industry forever.
[[File:Korg D888.jpg|right|thumb|Korg D888 eight-track digital recorder]]
By the late 1990s, dedicated multitrack recorders faded with the introduction of the [[classic Mac OS|Macintosh operating system]] and [[Windows operating system]]s in personal computers. Some of the first companies jumping on board with this technology were New England Digital and Digidesign, from the US &amp; Fairlight, from Australia. Through the 1990s, multitrack recorders became digital, using a variety of technologies and media types. These including digital tape format (such as [[ADAT]]), or in some cases [[Minidisc]]s.

Some of the leading providers of multitrackers were [[Tascam]] (hard drive or cassette based), [[Alesis]] (ADAT digital tape based), [[Roland Corporation|Roland]]/[[Boss Corporation|Boss]] (hard drive based), [[Fostex]] (hard drive based), [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] (hard drive based), and [[Korg]].

A highly competitive market and rapidly falling costs for this equipment has made it common to find multitrack recording technology outside a typical recording studio.

== Computer-based recording ==

The first software-based digital multi-track recorder, called Deck, was released in 1990. The core engine technology and much of the user interface was programmed and designed by Josh Rosen, Mats Myrberg and John Dalton from a small San Francisco based company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.12/osc.html Wired article on Digidesign/OSC history]&lt;/ref&gt; They formed the platform upon which [[Pro Tools]] was built in 1991. The same technology lay behind the 1992 release of [[Cubase]] Audio, the first version to offer audio support in addition to [[MIDI]] sequencing capabilities.

While hardware costs have fallen the power of the personal computer have increased, so that in the 2010s, a good quality home computer is sufficiently powerful to serve as a complete multitrack recorder, if a band or performer has a USB microphone or a regular microphone and a [[sound card]] adapter, using inexpensive hardware and software. Since 2012, the multitracking software [[GarageBand]] is offered as a free download for all of [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] new computers or $4.99 for older models.  GarageBand added to the many free or under $100 solutions available to the Windows platform that run on less expensive but often more powerful hardware.  In a price range between $150 and usually under $1000, superior software mimicking complex recording studios that once could cost a hundred thousand dollars, or more, are also available  However solutions this powerful are not needed for most applications.  This is a far cry from the days when multitrack recorders cost thousands of dollars and few people could afford them.  In early (circa) 2000 the availability of low cost CakeWalk for windows provided opportunities for many to get a start in multi-track digital recording on the Windows for around $50 to $100.  After hardware became more powerful, more capabilities became available, including more digital channels and plug in effects.

In the 2010s, the availability of inexpensive software coupled with low cost hardware solutions, have enabled many [[singer-songwriter]]s to self-produce their first recordings without paying high fees for a professional recording studio or audio engineer. The most popular DAW today are: Pro Tools, Reaper, Live, Cubase, Logic and Digital Performer.

'''Institute for Personal Robots in Education''' ('''IPRE''') was initiated by a [[United States dollar|$]]1 million grant from [[Microsoft Research]] to [[Bryn Mawr College]] and the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] and announced in July 2006. IPRE is designing introductory [[computer science]] curricula centered on a [[Personal Robot]]. Their vision is that each student will purchase a small, inexpensive robot at the bookstore which they will use throughout their classes in exploring computer science. The hope is that the robot will cost about as much as a textbook. IPRE will develop the hardware, software, and curricular materials for these courses.

The software being developed for introductory computer science courses is called Myro, short for My Robot, and is based in part on Pyro from [[Python Robotics]]. Myro is an interface to communicate with robots. It is designed to be used through a number of computer languages, include [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]].

The robot currently being used is the [[Scribbler (robot)|Scribbler]] from [[Parallax, Inc. (company)]] augmented with a small computer board, called the Fluke. The Fluke contains [[Bluetooth]] and a camera. This allows any robot that has a serial interface to be controlled through the low-cost Fluke.

'''Integrated circuit design''', or '''IC design''', is a subset of [[electronics engineering]], encompassing the particular [[Boolean logic|logic]] and [[circuit design]] techniques required to design [[integrated circuits]], or ICs.  ICs consist of miniaturized [[electronic component]]s built into an [[electrical network]] on a monolithic [[semiconductor]] substrate by [[photolithography]].

IC design can be divided into the broad categories of [[Digital data|digital]] and [[analog electronics|analog]] IC design. Digital IC design is to produce components such as [[microprocessors]], [[FPGA]]s, memories ([[Random-access memory|RAM]], [[Read-only memory|ROM]], and [[flash memory|flash]]) and digital [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]]s. Digital design focuses on logical correctness, maximizing circuit density, and placing circuits so that clock and timing signals are routed efficiently. Analog IC design also has specializations in power IC design and [[Radio frequency|RF]] IC design. Analog IC design is used in the design of [[op-amp]]s, [[linear regulator]]s, [[phase locked loop]]s, [[oscillator]]s and [[active filter]]s. Analog design is more concerned with the physics of the semiconductor devices such as gain, matching, power dissipation, and resistance. Fidelity of analog signal amplification and filtering is usually critical and as a result, analog ICs use larger area active devices than digital designs and are usually less dense in circuitry.

Modern ICs are enormously complicated. An average desktop computer chip, as of 2015, has over 1 billion transistors. The [[Design rules|rules]] for what can and cannot be manufactured are also extremely complex. Common IC processes of 2015 have more than 500 rules. Furthermore, since the manufacturing process itself is not completely predictable, designers must account for its [[Statistics|statistical]] nature. The complexity of modern IC design, as well as market pressure to produce designs rapidly, has led to the extensive use of [[Electronic design automation|automated design tools]] in the IC design process.  In short, the design of an IC using [[Electronic design automation|EDA software]] is the design, test, and verification of the instructions that the IC is to carry out.

== Fundamentals ==

Integrated circuit design involves the creation of electronic components, such as [[transistors]], [[resistors]], [[capacitors]] and the metallic [[interconnect]] of these components onto a piece of semiconductor, typically [[silicon]]. A method to isolate the individual components formed in the [[Wafer (electronics)|substrate]] is necessary since the substrate silicon is conductive and often forms an active region of the individual components. The two common methods are [[p-n junction isolation]] and [[dielectric isolation]].  Attention must be given to power dissipation of transistors and interconnect resistances and current density of the [[interconnect]], [[Via (electronics)|contacts and vias]] since ICs contain very tiny devices compared to discrete components, where such concerns are less of an issue. [[Electromigration]] in metallic interconnect and [[Electrostatic discharge|ESD]] damage to the tiny components are also of concern. Finally, the physical layout of certain circuit subblocks is typically critical, in order to achieve the desired speed of operation, to segregate noisy portions of an IC from quiet portions, to balance the effects of heat generation across the IC, or to facilitate the [[Placement (EDA)|placement]] of connections to circuitry outside the IC.

===Design steps===

## Ramp up

Roughly saying, digital IC design can be divided into three parts.
*[[Electronic system-level]] design: This step creates the user functional specification. The user may use a variety of languages and tools to create this description. Examples include a [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]] model, [[SystemC]], [[SystemVerilog]] [[Transaction-level modeling|Transaction Level Models]], [[Simulink]] and [[MATLAB]].
*RTL design: This step converts the user specification (what the user wants the chip to do) into a [[register transfer level]] (RTL) description.  The RTL describes the exact behavior of the digital circuits on the chip, as well as the interconnections to inputs and outputs.
*Physical design:  This step takes the RTL, and a library of available logic gates, and creates a chip design.  This involves figuring out which gates to use, defining places for them, and wiring them together.

Note that the second step, RTL design, is responsible for the chip doing the right thing. The third step, physical design, does not affect the functionality at all (if done correctly) but determines how fast the chip operates and how much it costs.

==Design lifecycle==
The [[integrated circuit]] (IC) development process starts with defining product requirements, progresses through architectural definition, implementation, bringup and finally productization. The various phases of the integrated circuit development process are described below. Although the phases are presented here in a straightforward fashion, in reality there is [[iteration]] and these steps may occur multiple times.

===Requirements===
Before an [[architecture]] can be defined some high level product goals must be defined. The [[requirement]]s are usually generated by a cross functional team that addresses [[market opportunity]], customer needs, [[wiktionary:feasibility|feasibility]] and much more. This phase should result in a [[product requirements document]].

===Architecture===
The ''[[architecture]]'' defines the fundamental structure, goals and principles of the product. It defines high level concepts and the intrinsic value proposition of the product. Architecture teams take into account many variables and interface with many groups. People creating the architecture generally have a significant amount of experience dealing with systems in the area for which the architecture is being created. The work product of the architecture phase is an architectural [[specification]].

===Micro-architecture===
The micro-architecture is a step closer to the hardware. It implements the architecture and defines specific mechanisms and structures for achieving that implementation. The result of the micro-architecture phase is a micro-architecture specification which describes the methods used to implement the architecture.

===Implementation===
In the implementation phase the design itself is created using the micro-architectural specification as the starting point. This involves low level [[definition]] and partitioning, writing [[code]], entering schematics and verification. This phase ends with a [[design]] reaching [[tape-out|tapeout]].

===Bringup===
After a design is created, taped-out and manufactured, actual hardware, 'first silicon', is received  which is taken into the lab where it goes through ''bringup''. Bringup is the process of powering, testing and characterizing the design in the lab. Numerous [[Quality control|tests]] are performed starting from very simple tests such as ensuring that the device will power on to much more complicated tests which try to stress the part in various ways. The result of the bringup phase is documentation of [[characterization data]] (how well the part performs to spec) and errata (unexpected behavior).

===Productization===
Productization is the task of taking a design from engineering into mass production manufacturing. Although a design may have successfully met the specifications of the product in the lab during the bringup phase there are many challenges that face product engineers when trying to mass-produce those designs. The [[integrated circuit|IC]] must be ramped up to production volumes with an acceptable yield. The goal of the productization phase is to reach mass production volumes at an acceptable cost.

===Sustaining===
Once a design is mature and has reached mass production it must be sustained. The process must be continually monitored and problems dealt with quickly to avoid a significant impact on production volumes. The goal of sustaining is to maintain production volumes and continually reduce costs until the product reaches [[end-of-life (product)|end of life]].

== Design process ==

=== Microarchitecture and system-level design ===
The initial chip design process begins with system-level design and microarchitecture planning. Within IC design companies, management and often analytics will draft a proposal for a design team to start the design of a new chip to fit into an industry segment. Upper-level designers will meet at this stage to decide how the chip will operate functionally. This step is where an IC's functionality and design are decided. IC designers will map out the functional requirements, verification testbenches, and testing methodologies for the whole project, and will then turn the preliminary design into a system-level specification that can be simulated with simple models using languages like C++ and MATLAB and emulation tools. For pure and new designs, the system design stage is where an [[Instruction set]] and operation is planned out, and in most chips existing instruction sets are modified for newer functionality. Design at this stage is often statements such as ''encodes in the [[MP3]] format'' or ''implements [[IEEE floating-point arithmetic]]''. At later stages in the design process, each of these innocent looking statements expands to hundreds of pages of textual documentation.

=== RTL design ===
Upon agreement of a system design, RTL designers then implement the functional models in a hardware description language like [[Verilog]], [[SystemVerilog]], or [[VHDL]]. Using digital design components like adders, shifters, and state machines as well as computer architecture concepts like pipelining, superscalar execution, and [[branch prediction]], RTL designers will break a functional description into hardware models of components on the chip working together. Each of the simple statements described in the system design can easily turn into thousands of lines of [[Register-transfer level|RTL]] code, which is why it is extremely difficult to verify that the RTL will do the right thing in all the possible cases that the user may throw at it.

To reduce the number of functionality bugs, a separate hardware verification group will take the RTL and design testbenches and systems to check that the RTL actually is performing the same steps under many different conditions, classified as the domain of [[functional verification]]. Many techniques are used, none of them perfect but all of them useful &amp;ndash; extensive [[logic simulation]], [[formal methods]], [[hardware emulation]], [[Lint programming tool|lint]]-like code checking, [[code coverage]], and so on.

A tiny error here can make the whole chip useless, or worse.  The famous [[Pentium FDIV bug]] caused the results of a division to be wrong by at most 61 parts per million, in cases that occurred very infrequently.  No one even noticed it until the chip had been in production for months.  Yet [[Intel]] was forced to offer to replace, for free, every chip sold until they could fix the bug, at a cost of $475 million (US).{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== Physical design ===
[[File:FlowPhysicalDesign.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Physical design steps within the digital design flow]]

RTL is only a behavioral model of the actual functionality of what the chip is supposed to operate under. It has no link to a physical aspect of how the chip would operate in real life at the materials, physics, and electrical engineering side. For this reason, the next step in the IC design process, [[Physical design (electronics)|physical design]] stage, is to map the RTL into actual geometric representations of all electronics devices, such as capacitors, resistors, logic gates, and transistors that will go on the chip.

The main steps of physical design are listed below. In practice there is not a straightforward progression - considerable iteration is required to ensure all objectives are met simultaneously.  This is a difficult problem in its own right, called [[design closure]].

*[[Logic synthesis]]:  The RTL is mapped into a gate-level netlist in the target technology of the chip.
*[[Floorplan (microelectronics)|Floorplanning]]: The RTL of the chip is assigned to gross regions of the chip, input/output (I/O) pins are assigned and large objects (arrays, cores, etc.) are placed.
*[[Placement (EDA)|Placement]]:  The gates in the netlist are assigned to nonoverlapping locations on the die area.
*Logic/placement refinement: Iterative logical and placement transformations to close performance and power constraints.
*[[Clock Distribution Networks|Clock insertion]]: Clock signal wiring is (commonly, [[clock tree]]s)  introduced into the design.
*[[Routing (EDA)|Routing]]: The wires that connect the gates in the netlist are added.
*Postwiring optimization:  Performance ([[timing closure]]), noise ([[signal integrity]]), and yield ([[Design for manufacturability (IC)|Design for manufacturability]]) violations are removed.
*[[Design for manufacturability (IC)|Design for manufacturability]]:  The design is modified, where possible, to make it as easy and efficient as possible to produce. This is achieved by adding extra vias or adding dummy metal/diffusion/poly layers wherever possible while complying to the design rules set by the foundry.
*Final checking: Since errors are expensive, time consuming and hard to spot, extensive error checking is the rule, [[Formal equivalence checking|making sure the mapping to logic was done correctly]], and [[Design rule checking|checking that the manufacturing rules were followed faithfully]].
*[[Tape-out|Tapeout]] and mask generation: the design data is turned into [[photomask]]s in [[mask data preparation]].

== Analog design ==
Before the advent of the microprocessor and software based design tools, analog ICs were designed using hand calculations and process kit parts. These ICs were low complexity circuits, for example, [[op-amp]]s, usually involving no more than ten transistors and few connections. An iterative trial-and-error process and "overengineering" of device size was often necessary to achieve a manufacturable IC. Reuse of proven designs allowed progressively more complicated ICs to be built upon prior knowledge. When inexpensive computer processing became available in the 1970s, computer programs were written to simulate circuit designs with greater accuracy than practical by hand calculation. The first circuit simulator for analog ICs was called [[SPICE]] (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuits Emphasis). Computerized circuit simulation tools enable greater IC design complexity than hand calculations can achieve, making the design of analog [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]]s practical. The computerized circuit simulators also enable mistakes to be found early in the design cycle before a physical device is [[Semiconductor fabrication|fabricated]]. Additionally, a computerized circuit simulator can implement more sophisticated device models and circuit analysis too tedious for hand calculations, permitting [[Monte Carlo analysis]] and process sensitivity analysis to be practical. The effects of parameters such as temperature variation, doping concentration variation and statistical process variations can be simulated easily to determine if an IC [[Design for manufacturability (IC)|design is manufacturable]]. Overall, computerized circuit simulation enables a higher degree of confidence that the circuit will work as expected upon manufacture.

===Coping with variability===

A challenge most critical to analog IC design involves the variability of the individual devices built on the semiconductor chip. Unlike board-level circuit design which permits the designer to select devices that have each been tested and binned according to value, the device values on an IC can vary widely which are uncontrollable by the designer. For example, some IC resistors can vary ±20% and β of an integrated [[Bipolar junction transistor|BJT]] can vary from 20 to 100. In the latest CMOS processes, β of vertical PNP transistors can even go below 1. To add to the design challenge, device properties often vary between each processed semiconductor wafer. Device properties can even vary significantly across each individual IC due to doping [[gradients]]. The underlying cause of this variability is that many semiconductor devices are highly sensitive to uncontrollable random variances in the process. Slight changes to the amount of diffusion time, uneven doping levels, etc. can have large effects on device properties.

Some design techniques used to reduce the effects of the device variation are:
* Using the ratios of resistors, which do match closely, rather than absolute resistor value.
* Using devices with matched geometrical shapes so they have matched variations.
* Making devices large so that statistical variations becomes an insignificant fraction of the overall device property.
* Segmenting large devices, such as resistors, into parts and interweaving them to cancel variations.
* Using [[common centroid]] device layout to cancel variations in devices which must match closely (such as the transistor differential pair of an [[op amp]]).

== Background ==
The construction industry has suffered from a productivity decline since the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Why Construction Industry Productivity is Declining | work=Steven G. Allen, [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] no. 1555, Feb., 1985 | url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/1555.html | accessdate=2008-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2014|title=Construction Productivity in Decline|url=http://www.leanconstruction.org/media/docs/PEJune14_Construction.pdf|journal=PE Magazine|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while all other non-farm industries have seen large boosts in productivity.  The problems in contemporary construction include buildings that are behind schedule and over budget as well as adverse relations among the [[owner]], [[general contractor]], and [[architect]].  Using ideas developed by Toyota in their [[Toyota Production System]] and computer technology advances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Integrated Project Delivery builds a brave, new BIM world | work=Building Design+Construction, April 1, 2008 | url=http://www.bdcnetwork.com/integrated-project-delivery-builds-brave-new-bim-world | accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; the integrated project delivery method is designed to solve these key construction problems.  The new focus in IPD is the final value created for the owner, the finished building. Rather than each participant focusing exclusively on their part of construction without considering the implications on the whole process, the IPD method brings all participants together early with collaborative incentives to maximize value for the owner. This collaborative approach allows informed decision making early in the project where the most value can be created.  The close collaboration eliminates a great deal of waste in the design, and allows data sharing directly between the design and construction team eliminating a large barrier to increased productivity in construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Cost Analysis of Inadequate Interoperability in the U.S. Capital Facilities Industry | work=[[U.S. Department of Commerce]] Technology Administration, [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], Aug., 2004 | url=http://www.bfrl.nist.gov/oae/publications/gcrs/04867.pdf | accessdate=2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IPD in practice ==

Integrated project delivery is a delivery system that seeks to align interests, objectives and practices, even in a single business, through a team-based approach. The primary team members include the architect, key technical consultants as well as a general contractor and key subcontractors. The IPD system is a process where all disciplines in a construction project work as one firm, creating faster delivery times, lower costs, no litigation and a more enjoyable process for the entire team – including the owner.

IPD combines ideas from integrated practice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=    * Integrated practice in perspective: A new model for the architectural profession | work=[[Architectural Record]], May, 2007 | url=http://archrecord.construction.com/practice/projDelivery/0705proj-1.asp | accessdate=2008-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[lean construction]] to solve several problems in contemporary construction such as low productivity and waste, time overruns, quality issues, and conflicts during construction among the key stakeholders of owner, architect and contractor.  The growing use of [[building information modeling]] in the construction industry is allowing far greater information collaboration between project participants using IPD and considered an important tool to increasing productivity throughout the construction process.

Unlike the [[design–build]] project delivery method which typically places the contractor in the leading role on a building project, IPD represents a return to the "master builder" concept where the entire building team including the owner, [[architect]], [[general contractor]], [[building engineer]]s, fabricators, and [[subcontractor]]s work collaboratively throughout the [[construction]] process.

Note: Job Order Contracting, JOC is form of integrated project delivery that specifically targets repair, renovation, and minor new construction.  It has proven to be capable of delivering over 90% of projects on-time, on-budget, and to the satisfaction of all participants and stakeholders.  [https://4buildingtogetherdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/2015-joc-report.pdf JOC Research Report.]

Note: A significant criticism of IPD is the absence of any mention or effort to integrate project safety into the method.  Excluding safety will likely lead to poor safety performance on projects using IPD.

== Multi-Party Agreements ==
One common way to further the goals of IPD is through a multi-party agreement among key participants. In a multi-party agreement (MPA), the primary project participants execute a single contract specifying their respective roles, rights, obligations, and liabilities. In effect, the multi-party agreement creates a temporary virtual, and in some instances formal, organization to realize a specific project. Because a single agreement is used, each party understands its role in relationship to the other participants. Compensation structures are often open-book, so each party’s interests and contributions are similarly transparent. Multi-party agreements require trust, as compensation is tied to overall project success and individual success depends on the contributions of all team members. For an MPA to be successful, the participants must be committed to working as a team to achieve team goals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Common forms of multi-party agreements include 
* project alliances, which create a project structure where the owner guaranteed the direct costs of non-owner parties, but payment of profit, overhead and bonus depends on project outcome; 
* a single-purpose entity, which is a temporary, but formal, legal structure created to realize a specific project; 
* and relational contracts, which are similar to Project Alliances in that a virtual organization is created from individual entities, but it differs in its approach to compensation, risk sharing and decision making.

== The role of technology in IPD ==

The adoption of IPD as a standard for collaborative good practice on [[construction]] projects presents its own problems. As most construction projects involve disparate stakeholders, traditional IT solutions are not conducive to collaborative working. Sharing files behind IT [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]], large email attachment sizes and the ability to view all manner of file types without the native software all make IPD difficult. 

The need to overcome collaborative IT challenges has been one of the drivers behind the growth of online [[construction collaboration technology]]. Since 2000, a new generation of technology companies evolved using [[SaaS]] to facilitate IPD in a smooth and efficient manner. 

This [[collaboration software]] streamlines the flow of documentation, communications and workflows ensuring everyone is working from 'one version of the truth'. [[Collaboration software]] allows users from disparate locations to keep all communications, documents &amp; drawings, forms and data, amongst other types of electronic file, in one place. [[Version control]] is assured and users are able to view and mark up files online without the need for native software.  The technology also enables project confidence and mitigates risk thanks to inbuilt audit trails.

The '''International Association for Military Pedagogy (IAMP)'''[http://www.militarypedagogy.org] was founded in November 2005 in Strausberg (Germany) as a successor to the European Military Pedagogy Forum (EMPF). 

The IAMP is an independent network of professionals whose studies focus on education and training in the [[military]] setting. Its goals include the spreading of information that would assist professional military institutions of advanced learning (e.g. [[military academies]] and [[staff colleges]]). The purpose of IAMP activities is to encourage discussion and  development in the theory of military pedagogy. Academics concerned with such subjects in civilian institutions of [[Higher education|higher learning]] can participate in the Association.

The Association accomplishes its goals by promoting research, publication, and information sharing among its membership. The IAMP establishes contacts among military institutions of higher learning, as well as among national and international agencies. Annual conferences are hosted by member institutions.

Membership is open to individuals with a professional interest in military pedagogy.

In [[astrometry]], an '''International Celestial Reference Frame''' ('''ICRF''') is a realization of the [[International Celestial Reference System]] (ICRS) using reference celestial sources observed at radio wavelengths.  In the context of the ICRS, a [[frame of reference|reference ''frame'']] is the ''physical realization'' of a reference ''system,'' i.e., the reference frame is the set of reported coordinates of the reference sources, with the coordinates derived using the procedures spelled out by the ICRS.&lt;ref name="USNO"&gt;{{cite web |title=International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/ICRS_doc.php |website=aa.usno.navy.mil |publisher=US Navy |accessdate=29 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICRF creates a quasi-[[inertial frame of reference]] centered at the [[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|barycenter]] of the [[Solar System]], whose axes are defined by the measured positions of [[extragalactic astronomy|extragalactic sources]] (mainly [[quasar]]s) observed using [[very long baseline interferometry]]. Although [[general relativity]] implies that there are no true inertial frames around [[gravitation|gravitating]] bodies, the ICRF is important because it does not exhibit any measurable [[angular motion]] since the extragalactic sources used to define the ICRF are so far away. The ICRF is now the standard reference frame used to define the positions of the planets (including the [[Earth]]) and other [[astronomical object]]s.

==ICRF1==

The ICRF, now called ICRF1, was adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] on 1 January 1998.&lt;ref name=ICRF2_tn35&gt;{{cite web|title=IERS Technical Note No. 35: The Second Realization of the International Celestial Reference Frame by Very Long Baseline Interferometry|url=https://www.iers.org/SharedDocs/Publikationen/EN/IERS/Publications/tn/TechnNote35/tn35.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=1|publisher=International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS)|accessdate=5 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725164148/http://ww2.iers.org/SharedDocs/Publikationen/EN/IERS/Publications/tn/TechnNote35/tn35.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=1%2CtemplateId%3Draw%2Cproperty%3DpublicationFile.pdf%2Ftn35.pdf|archivedate=25 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICRF1 had an angular [[noise floor]] of approximately 250 [[microarcsecond]]s (µas) and a reference axis stability of approximately 20 µas; this was an order-of-magnitude improvement over the previous reference frame derived from [[Fifth Fundamental Catalog]] (FK5).&lt;ref name=ICRF2_tn35 /&gt; The ICRF1 contains 212 defining sources and also contains positions of 396 additional non-defining sources for reference. The positions of these sources have been adjusted in later extensions to the catalogue. The ICRF1 agrees with the orientation of the Fifth Fundamental Catalog (FK5) "[[J2000.0]]" frame to within the (lower) precision of the latter.

==ICRF2==

An updated reference frame ICRF2 was created in 2009.&lt;ref name=ICRF2_tn35/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steigerwald2009"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Steigerwald |first1=Bell |title=NASA - New Celestial Map Gives Directions for GPS |url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2009/icrf2.html |website=www.nasa.gov |publisher=NASA |accessdate=5 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The update was a joint collaboration of the [[International Astronomical Union]], the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]], and the [[International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry]].&lt;ref name="Fey2009"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fey |first1=Alan L. |title=The International Celestial Reference Frame |url=http://rorf.usno.navy.mil/ICRF2/ |website=rorf.usno.navy.mil |publisher=US Naval Office (USNO) |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICRF2 is defined by the position of 295 compact radio sources (97 of which also define ICRF1).  Alignment of ICRF2 with ICRF1-Ext2, the second extension of ICRF1, was made with 138 sources common to both reference frames. Including non-defining sources, it comprises 3414 sources measured using [[very-long-baseline interferometry]]. The ICRF2 has a noise floor of approximately 40&amp;nbsp;µas and an axis stability of approximately 10&amp;nbsp;µas. Maintenance of the ICRF2 will be accomplished by a set of 295 sources that have especially good positional stability and unambiguous spatial structure. 

The data used to derive the reference frame come from approximately 30 years of VLBI observations, from 1979 to 2009.&lt;ref name=ICRF2_tn35/&gt; Radio observations in both the S-band (2.3GHz) and X-band (8.4GHz) were recorded simultaneously to allow correction for [[ionospheric]] effects. The observations resulted in about 6.5 million group-delay measurements among pairs of telescopes. The group delays were processed with software that takes into account atmospheric and geophysical processes. The positions of the reference sources were treated as unknowns to be solved for by minimizing the [[mean squared error]] across group-delay measurements. The solution was constrained to be consistent with the [[International Terrestrial Reference Frame]] (ITRF2008) and [[earth orientation parameters]] (EOP) systems. 

ICRF3 is in development with a planned release date of August 2018.&lt;ref name="Gaume2013"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gaume USNO |first1=Ralph |last2=Ma, GSFC |first2=Chopo |title=ICRF-3 Overview |url=https://www.iers.org/SharedDocs/Publikationen/EN/IERS/Workshops/Retreat2013/2_Gaume.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=1 |publisher=IERS DB Retreat, Paris, France, 23 May 2013 |accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21694">An '''Internet leak''' occurs when a party's [[confidentiality|confidential]] information is released to the public on the [[Internet]]. Various types of information and data can be, and have been, "leaked" to the Internet, the most common being personal information, computer [[software]] and [[source code]], and artistic works such as books or [[album]]s. For example, a musical album is leaked if it has been made available to the public on the Internet before its official release date; and is still intended to be confidential.

== Source code leaks ==
'''[[Source code]] leaks''' are usually caused by misconfiguration of software like [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] or [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] which allow people to get source files by exploiting, by software [[computer bug|bugs]], or by employees that have access to the sources of part of them revealing the code in order to harm the company.

There were many cases of source code leaks in the history of software development.

For instance, as [[Fraunhofer society|Fraunhofer IIS]] released in 1994 only a low quality version of their [[MP3]] encoding software ([[l3enc]]), a hacker named SoloH gathered the [[source code]] from the unprotected servers of the [[University of Erlangen]] and developed a higher quality version, which started the MP3 revolution on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/09/the-heavenly-jukebox/305141/ The heavenly jukebox] on [[The Atlantic]] ''"To show industries how to use the codec, MPEG cobbled together a free sample program that converted music into MP3 files. The demonstration software created poor-quality sound, and Fraunhofer did not intend that it be used. The software's "source code"—its underlying instructions—was stored on an easily accessible computer at the University of Erlangen, from which it was downloaded by one SoloH, a hacker in the Netherlands (and, one assumes, a Star Wars fan). SoloH revamped the source code to produce software that converted compact-disc tracks into music files of acceptable quality."'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.de/books?id=3M2hAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT75&amp;lpg=PT75&amp;dq=SoloH+mp3+source+code&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FlIeulG_zi&amp;sig=VKYpKgUjOXqOk_aBEH5Kfi3WKk4&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8la2n46TRAhUMe1AKHT7fBb4Q6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=SoloH%20mp3%20source%20code&amp;f=false Pop Idols and Pirates: Mechanisms of Consumption and the Global Circulation ...] by Dr Charles Fairchild&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/1765/989 Technologies of Piracy? - Exploring the Interplay  Between Commercialism and Idealism in the Development of MP3 and DivX] by HENDRIK STORSTEIN SPILKER, SVEIN HÖIER, page 2072, [[International Journal of Communication]] 7 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronet.nl/~soloh/mpegEnc/ euronet.nl/~soloh/mpegEnc]&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1996 [[Electronic Arts]] accidentally put  the source code of [[FIFA 97]] on a demo disc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://kotaku.com/5882488/when-ea-sports-accidentally-put-a-games-source-code-on-a-demo-disc When EA Sports Accidentally Put a Game's Source Code on a Demo Disc] by Luke Plunkett on [[kotaku.com]] (02-05-2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 a [[software hacking|hacker]] exploited a security hole in [[Microsoft|Microsoft's]] [[Microsoft Office Outlook|Outlook]] to get the complete source of the video game ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', which was under development at the time.&lt;ref name="source code leak"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2003/10/07/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/ |title=Playable Version of Half-Life 2 Stolen |work=CNN Money |accessdate=February 14, 2007 | date=2003-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-02-21-the-boy-who-stole-half-life-2-article |title=The Boy Who Stole Half-Life 2 - The story behind the $250 million robbery. |first=Simon |last=Parkin |date=2011-02-21 |accessdate=2013-09-05 |publisher=eurogamer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete source was soon available in various [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|file sharing network]]s.  This leak was rumored to be the cause of the game's delay,&lt;ref name="leak delays release"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/31783.html |title=Half Life 2 Source-Code Leak Delays Debut |work=TechNewsWorld |accessdate=February 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later was stated not to be.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/what-drove-one-half-life-2-super-fan-to-hack-into-valves-servers/ Catching up with the guy who stole Half-Life 2’s source code, 10 years later] by Simon Parkin on [[Ars Technica]] (Jun 19, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2003, source code to [[Diebold Election Systems]] Inc. [[voting machine]]s was leaked. Researchers at [[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[Rice University]] published a damning critique of Diebold's products, based on an analysis of the software. They found, for example, that it would be easy to program a counterfeit voting card to work with the machines and then use it to cast multiple votes inside the voting booth.

In 2003 a Chinese Hacker acquired the [[Lineage II]] source code, and sold it to someone who set up alternative servers. Shutdown by [[FBI]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmorpg.com/lineage-2/news/fbi-shuts-down-lineage-ii-private-server-1000007104 fbi-shuts-down-lineage-ii-private-server] on mmorpg.com (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071212021338/http://www.fbi.gov/page2/feb07/iptheft020107.htm CRACKING THE CODE Online IP Theft Is Not a Game] on FBI.gov (02/01/2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, one year after [[3dfx]] was bought by [[Nvidia]] and support ended, the source code for their drivers leaked,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.golem.de/0305/25378.html Treiber-Quellcode von 3dfx im Netz aufgetaucht - Von Nvidia offenbar geduldet] by Christian Klaß on Golem.de (7 May 2003, in German)&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in [[fan-made]], updated drivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuangel.net/NuDrivers/ NuAngel.net Drivers] on nuangel.net&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, a large portion of [[Windows NT 4.0]]'s source code and a small percentage (reportedly about 15%) of [[Windows 2000]]'s were leaked online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/114771/article.html Windows Code May Be Stolen] on [[PC World]] by Joris Evers (February 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The Windows 2000 source code leak was analysed by a writer for (now defunct) website Kuro5hin who noted that while the code was generally well written, allegedly "there are a dozen or so 'fucks' and 'shits', and hundreds of 'craps'." The writer also noted that there were a lot of code hacks, with the "uglier" ones mostly being for compatibility with older programs and some hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://atdt.freeshell.org/k5/story_2004_2_15_71552_7795.html|title=We Are Morons: a quick look at the Win2k source {{!}}{{!}} kuro5hin.org|website=atdt.freeshell.org|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was feared that because of the leak, the number of security [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]]s would increase due to wider scrutiny of the source code. It was later discovered that the source of the leak originated from [[Mainsoft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Also in 2004, partial (800&amp;nbsp;MB) proprietary source code that drives [[Cisco Systems]]' networking hardware was made available in the internet. The site posted two files of source code written in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], which apparently enables some next-generation [[IPv6]] functionality. News of the latest source code leak appeared on a Russian security site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.SecurityLab.ru|title=SecurityLab|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] hackers stole source code (about 1&amp;nbsp;GiB) for [[Symantec]]'s [[pcAnywhere]] from the company's network. While confirmed in January 2012, it is still unclear how the hackers accessed the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/01/symantec-suspected-breach-in-2006-didnt-confirm-until-anonymous-revealed-source-code.ars|title=Symantec suspected source code breach back in 2006|work=[[Ars Technica]]|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2007, the source code of [[Norton Ghost|Norton Ghost 12]] and a [[Norton Anti-Spyware]] version were available via [[BitTorrent]].

In December 2007 and January 8, a [[Pirate Bay]] user published the sources of five [http://www.idera.com Idera] [[SQL]] products via BitTorrent.

In January 2011 the "stolen source code" of [[Kaspersky Anti-Virus|Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2008]] was published on the Pirate Bay.

On May 20, 2011, [[EVE Online]]'s [[source code]] was published by someone on a [[GitHub]] repository.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geek.com/games/eve-online-source-code-posted-online-dmca-takedown-quickly-follows-1382821/ |title=Eve Online source code posted online, DMCA takedown quickly follows |first=Matthew |last=Humphries |date=2011-05-25 |accessdate=2015-11-07 |publisher=geek.com |quote=It looks as though someone has posted the source code for the space MMO Eve Online there.

In 2011 the [[source code]] of [[GunZ: The Duel]] v1.5 [[Source code leak|became available]] online.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ragezone.com/2011/11/20/gunz-1-5-source-code-released/ Gunz 1.5 Source Code released.] on ragezone.com (20 November 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, the source code of the [[Solaris 11]] operating system's kernel was leaked via BitTorrent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTAzMDE Oracle Solaris 11 Kernel Source-Code Leaked] on [[Phoronix]] by [[Michael Larabel]] (on 19 December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014 [[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky]]'s [[X-Ray Engine]] [[source code]] (and its successor) became available on [[GitHub]] under a non-[[open-source license]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/OpenXRay/xray xray] on github.com (August 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/OpenXRay/xray-16 xray-16] on github.com&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 29, 2015 the [[AmigaOS]] 3.1 source code leaked to the web, confirmed by the rights holder [[Hyperion Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=AmigaOS-3.1-Leak-Confirmed| title=Hyperion Confirms Leak Of AmigaOS 3.1 Source Code

In January 2017 the source code of Opera's [[Presto (layout engine)|Presto]] Browser engine was leaked to GitHub.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/operabrowser/comments/5nk69m/presto_engine_source_code_available_on_github/ presto_engine_source_code_available_on_github] (2017)&lt;/ref&gt; The source code was shortly after taken down with a DMCA notice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/prestocore/browser/network github.com/prestocore]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017 part of Microsoft's [[Windows 10]] source code leaked to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/24/windows-10-source-code-leak-embarrassment-microsoft/ Windows 10 source code leak is an embarrassment for Microsoft - It's less serious than initially thought but still important, given security is high on everyone’s mind.] by Swapna Krishna on engadget.com (June 24, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== End-of-life leaks by developers ===
Sometimes software developers themselves will leak their source code in an effort to prevent a software product from becoming [[abandonware]] after it has reached its [[End-of-life (product)|end-of-life]], allowing the community to continue development and support. Reasons for leaking instead of a proper release to [[public domain]] or as [[open-source software|open-source]] can include scattered or lost [[intellectual property rights]]. An example is the [[video game]] ''[[Falcon 4.0]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/01/21/diehard_pilots_keep_falcon_flying/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040408111542/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/01/21/diehard_pilots_keep_falcon_flying/|archivedate=2004-04-08 |accessdate=2016-06-28 |publisher=Boston.com|title=Diehard pilots keep Falcon flying|author=Hiawatha Bray|date=2004-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="falcon4.0leak"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleared-to-engage.com/2011/03/12/interview-with-kevin-klemmick-lead-software-engineer-for-falcon-4-0/|title=Interview with Kevin Klemmick - Lead Software Engineer for Falcon 4.0 | publisher=Cleared-To-Engage |date=2011-03-12 |first=Giorgio |last=Bertolone |accessdate=2014-08-31 |quote=''[C2E] In 2000 the source code of Falcon 4.0 leaked out and after that groups of volunteers were able to make fixes and enhancements that assured the longevity of this sim.

Another notable example is an archive of [[Infocom]]'s video games [[source code]] which appeared from an anonymous Infocom source and was archived by the [[Internet Archive]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waxy.org/2008/04/milliways_infocoms_unreleased_sequel_to_hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galax/ |title=Milliways: Infocom's Unreleased Sequel to Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|date=Apr 17, 2008|quote=''From an anonymous source close to the company, I've found myself in possession of the "Infocom Drive" — a complete backup of Infocom's shared network drive from 1989.[...] Among the assets included: design documents, email archives, employee phone numbers, sales figures, internal meeting notes, corporate newsletters, and the source code and game files for every released and unreleased game Infocom made''|publisher=waxy.org |first=Andy |last=Baio |accessdate=2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other leaks ==
* In late 1998, a number of confidential [[Microsoft]] documents later dubbed the ''[[Halloween documents]]'' were leaked to [[Eric S. Raymond]], an activist in the [[open-source software]] movement, who published and commented on them online. The documents revealed that internally Microsoft viewed free and open-source software such as [[Linux]] as technologically competitive and a major threat for Microsoft's dominance in the market, and they discussed strategies to combat them. The discovery caused a public controversy. The documents were also used as evidence in several court cases.
* [[Nintendo]]'s crossover fighting video game series ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' has a history of having unconfirmed content leaked. While the first two games predated its online community, every game since has been leaked in some form:
** ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' for the [[Wii]] was leaked by a video on the [[Japanese language]] wii.com website, revealing unconfirmed playable characters on January 28, 2008 (three days before the game's Japanese release).
** ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' was afflicted in August 2014 by the "ESRB leak", where many screenshots and limited video footage of the 3DS version were leaked by a supposed member of the [[ESRB]]. The leak gained traction very quickly due to the screenshots mostly containing elements that the game ratings board would be interested in, such as trophies of suggestively-dressed female characters (some of which were later found to be edited or cut altogether in the final game).
** ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' was leaked in its entirety two weeks before its release, allowing many to play and datamine in advance. While the entire roster of characters and stages had already been officially revealed, many unrevealed collectibles, music tracks, and story elements were discovered and distributed. This prompted Nintendo to issue copyright strikes to many YouTube and Twitch channels.
* Several high-profile books have been leaked on the Internet before their official release date, including ''[[If I Did It]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', and an early draft of the first twelve chapters of ''[[Midnight Sun (Stephenie Meyer novel)|Midnight Sun]]''. The leak of the latter prompted the author [[Stephenie Meyer]] to suspend work on the novel.
* On January 31, 2014 the original uncensored version of the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[201 (South Park)|201]]" was leaked, when it was illegally pulled from the South Park Studios servers and was posted online in its entirety without any approval by [[Comedy Central]]. The episode was heavily censored by the network when it aired in 2010 against the will of series creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], and was never formally released uncensored to the public. The episode was the second in a [[story arc|two parter]] and was censored after the airing of the [[200 (South Park)|first part]] as a result of [[death threats]] from [[Islamic extremism|Islamic extremists]] who were angry of the episode's storyline satirizing censorship of [[depictions of Muhammad]].&lt;ref name=AVCLUBLEAKED&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Neal|first=Sean|title=An uncensored version of South Park's controversial Muhammad episode has surfaced|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/the-uncensored-version-of-south-parks-controversia-107422|publisher=[[The A.V. Club]]|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2015 the unaired ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'' episode "Boston" was leaked online. The episode was set to air during the [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force (season 5)|fifth season]], but [[Adult Swim]] was forced to pull it to avoid further controversy surrounding the [[2007 Boston bomb scare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gonzales|first1=Dave|title=Banned Aqua Teen Hunger Force Boston episode leaks online|url=http://www.geek.com/news/banned-aqua-teen-hunger-force-boston-episode-leaks-online-1620022/|publisher=[[Geek.com]]|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On March 13, 2016, the full list of qualifying teams and first round match-ups for the [[2016 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] leaked on Twitter in the midst of a television special being broadcast by [[CBS Sports|CBS]] to officially unveil them. The leak exacerbated criticism of a new, two-hour format for the selection broadcast, which was criticized for revealing the full tournament bracket at a slower pace than in previous years.&lt;ref name="wp-ssratings"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ratings for CBS's NCAA tournament selection show were almost as bad as show itself|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/03/14/ratings-for-cbss-ncaa-tournament-selection-show-were-almost-as-bad-as-show-itself/|date=March 14, 2016|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lat-twohour"&gt;{{cite news|title=NCAA says it's investigating the bracket leak that saved us from the two-hour Selection Sunday show|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-ncaa-tournament-bracket-leak-20160314-story.html|date=March 14, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Keim's process''' is a technique of [[fresco]] preparation and painting intended to maximize the lifetime of the finished work. The process, as reported in 1884 at the [[Royal Society of Arts]] in London, was created by chemist and craftsman Adolf Wilhelm Keim of [[Munich]], as an improvement on the earlier [[stereochromy]] technique of Schlotthaner and [[Johann Nepomuk von Fuchs]].&lt;ref name="rivington"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rivington | first = J.

==The process==
*First, the surface to be painted is prepared by removing any damp bricks, overly burnt bricks, or decayed wood, and replacing these, and also removing any existing traces of [[stucco]].
*The surface is then coated with a mixture of [[quartz]] sand, infusorial earth (calcined fossil meal), and powdered [[marble]], mixed four parts to one with [[quicklime]] [[calcium hydroxide|slaked]] with [[distilled water]]. The purpose of this layer is to ensure adhesion of the subsequent layers to the surface. Next, a layer of lime-sand [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] is applied to even the surface, with care taken to avoid cracking. This layer is allowed to dry for up to a year.
*Once dry, a painting ground composed of white quartz sand, marble sand, marble meal, and infusorial earth is combined eight parts to one with slaked lime, and applied to the surface at a thickness of one eighth to one quarter inch. This layer dries for several days, at which point a crust of [[carbonate]] has formed on the surface. This crust is removed with a mixture of one part [[hydrofluosilicic acid]] to three parts distilled water, which is brushed on and allowed to dry for 24 hours, after which the surface is rinsed with distilled water.
*A hardening fluid of one part [[potassium silicate]] to two parts water is then brushed on and allowed to dry for 24 hours, before a second layer is applied and allowed to dry again. This surface may be painted immediately, or may sit unpainted for several years.
*[[Pigment]]s (selected from a set of thirty-eight) are treated with [[alkaline]] solutions of [[potash]] or [[ammonia]] to prevent color change caused by the alkaline [[fixative (drawing)|fixative]] to come. Alternative pigments are best for those that cannot be used with an alkaline fixative.&lt;ref name="jackson"/&gt;
*Finally, the completed painting is fixed with an application of "[[waterglass]]" (sodium silicate) treated with [[ammonium carbonate]], applied in a fine spray in several layers, until no more is absorbed. The chemical interaction of the fixative with the underlying pigments and ground create a material analogous to marble, and highly resistant to chemical corrosion.&lt;ref name="builder"/&gt;

Keim's focus on carefully preparing the painting ground came from his study of older frescos and their state of preservation.&lt;ref name="osgood"&gt;{{cite book | last = Osgood | first = J. R. | author2 = et. al. | title = American Architect and Architecture | publisher = | volume = 15 | date = 1884 | pages = 125 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qJgwAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=%22Keim%27s+process%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=37GXMOD6PY&amp;sig=iOtL0ckgLyy6mHUqXfpvspHh6HE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Aps9VIbZHcv8sAS_u4KoCA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Keim's%20process%22&amp;f=false | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Keim reportedly labored for twelve years to refine his process.&lt;ref name="builder"/&gt;

'''Land navigation''', or '''orienteering''', is the military term for the study of traversing through unfamiliar terrain by foot or in a land vehicle. Land navigation includes the ability to read [[map]]s, use a [[compass]], and other [[navigation]]al skills.  

Land navigation courses are an essential part of military training.  Often, these courses are several miles long in rough terrain and are performed under adverse conditions, such as at night or in the rain.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Marine ecosystems''' are among the largest of [[Earth]]'s [[aquatic ecosystem]]s and are distinguished by waters that have a high salt content. These systems contrast with [[freshwater ecosystem]]s, which have a lower [[salt]] content. Marine waters cover more than 70% of the surface of the Earth and account for more than 97% of Earth's water supply&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oceanicinstitute.org/aboutoceans/aquafacts.html|title=Oceanic Institute|website=www.oceanicinstitute.org|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/habitats/ocean/|title=Ocean Habitats and Information|date=2017-01-05|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 90% of habitable space on Earth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/ioc-oceans/focus-areas/rio-20-ocean/blueprint-for-the-future-we-want/marine-biodiversity/facts-and-figures-on-marine-biodiversity/|title=Facts and figures on marine biodiversity {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Marine ecosystems include nearshore systems, such as the [[salt marsh]]es, [[Mudflat|mudflats]], [[Seagrass|seagrass meadows]], [[mangrove]]s, rocky [[Intertidal zone|intertidal systems]] and [[coral reefs]]. They also extend outwards from the coast to include offshore systems, such as the surface [[ocean]], [[Pelagic zone|pelagic ocean]] waters, the [[deep sea]], [[Hydrothermal vent|oceanic hydrothermal vents]], and the [[Benthos|sea floor]]. Marine ecosystems are characterized by their associated biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment.

== Types ==

=== Salt marsh ===
{{Main|Salt marsh}}
According to NOAA, salt marshes are defined as "coastal wetlands that are flooded and drained by salt water brought in by the tides".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/saltmarsh.html|title=What is a salt marsh?|last=Administration|first=US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric|website=oceanservice.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; These marshy grounds are able to prevent flooding as well as help maintain water quality by absorbing rainwater and runoff that comes through the area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Mangroves ===
{{Main|Mangrove}}
[[Mangrove|Mangroves]] are a compilation of different mangrove tree species living together near the coastline to create a forest. These mangrove forests have intricate root systems that provide habitat to many species and act as a buffer to soil erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/mangroves.html|title=What is a mangrove forest?|last=Administration|first=US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric|website=oceanservice.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intertidal zones ===
Intertidal zones are the areas that are visible during low tide and covered up by saltwater during high tide. In these zones simple organisms can be found in tide pools. These areas also have a higher salinity because salt is left diarrhea  has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thewildclassroom.com/biomes/intertidal.html|title=Intertidal zone|website=www.thewildclassroom.com|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Estuaries ===
Estuaries occur where there is a noticeable change in salinity between saltwater and freshwater sources, for example, the confluence between a river and an ocean. Many organisms rely on this fragile ecosystem at least once during their life cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/estuary.html|title=What is an estuary?|last=Administration|first=US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric|website=oceanservice.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lagoons ===
The National Geographic Society defines lagoons as a "shallow body of water protected from a larger body of water (usually the ocean) by sandbars, barrier islands, or coral reefs." There are two different types of lagoons: coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/lagoon/|title=lagoon|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-01-21|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coral reefs ===
{{Main|Coral reef}}
[[Coral reef|Coral reefs]] are one of the most well-known marine ecosystems within the world. The largest being that of the Great Barrier Reef. These reefs are composed of large coral colonies of a variety of species living together. The corals form multiple symbiotic relationships with the organisms around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ocean.si.edu/corals-and-coral-reefs|title=Corals and Coral Reefs|date=2012-09-12|work=Ocean Portal {{!}} Smithsonian|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deep sea and sea floor ===
{{see|deep sea community}}
The deep sea contains up to 95% of the space occupied by living organisms.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ocean.si.edu/deep-sea|title=The Deep Sea|date=2012-07-24|work=Ocean Portal {{!}} Smithsonian|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with the sea floor (or benthic zone), these two areas have yet to be fully explored and have their organisms documented.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ecosystemexperts.weebly.com/the-benthic-zone.html|title=The Benthic Zone|website=Ecosystems|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecosystem services ==
{{Main|Ecosystem services}}
In addition to providing many benefits to the natural world, marine ecosystems also provide social, economic, and biological [[ecosystem services]] to humans. Pelagic marine systems regulate the global climate, contribute to the water cycle, maintain biodiversity, provide food and energy resources, and create opportunities for recreation and tourism&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.287.aspx.pdf|title=Millenium Ecosystem Asessment, Marine Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Economically, marine systems support billions of dollars worth of capture fisheries, aquaculture, offshore oil and gas, and trade and shipping.

Ecosystem services fall into multiple categories, including supporting services, provisioning services, regulating services, and cultural services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oceanwealth.org/ecosystem-services/|title=Ecosystem Services {{!}} Mapping Ocean Wealth|website=oceanwealth.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-24|title=Ecosystem services|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ecosystem_services&amp;oldid=832161260|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Threats to marine ecosystems ==
Although marine ecosystems provide essential ecosystem services, these systems face various threats&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icriforum.org/about-coral-reefs/status-and-threat-coral-reefs|title=Status of and Threat to Coral Reefs  {{!}} International Coral Reef Initiative|website=www.icriforum.org|language=en|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Human exploitation and development ===
Coastal marine systems experience growing population pressure and nearly 40% of people in the world live within 100km of the coast&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.288.aspx.pdf|title=Millennium Ecosystem Asessment, Coastal Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Humans often aggregate near coastal habitats to take advantage of ecosystem services. For example, coastal capture fisheries from mangrove and coral reef habitats is estimated to be worth a minimum of $34 billion per year&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Yet, many of these habitats are either marginally protected or not protected. Mangrove area has declined worldwide by more than one-third since 1950&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alongi|first=Daniel M.|date=September 2002|title=Present state and future of the world's mangrove forests|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-conservation/article/present-state-and-future-of-the-worlds-mangrove-forests/0E3D6B0DF6EE2E9DBD48582964AD492A|journal=Environmental Conservation|language=en|volume=29|issue=3|pages=331–349|doi=10.1017/S0376892902000231|issn=1469-4387}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and 60% of the world's coral reefs are now immediately or directly threatened&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/components/coral-reefs-area|title=Coral Reefs|website=Ocean Health Index|language=en|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wri.org/publication/reefs-risk-revisited|title=Reefs at Risk Revisited {{!}} World Resources Institute|website=www.wri.org|language=en|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Human development, aquaculture, and industrialization often lead to the destruction, replacement, or degradation of coastal habitats&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

Moving offshore, pelagic marine systems are directly threatened by overfishing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coll|first=Marta|last2=Libralato|first2=Simone|last3=Tudela|first3=Sergi|last4=Palomera|first4=Isabel|last5=Pranovi|first5=Fabio|date=2008-12-10|title=Ecosystem Overfishing in the Ocean|url=https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003881|journal=PLoS ONE|language=en|volume=3|issue=12|pages=e3881|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0003881|issn=1932-6203|pmc=2587707|pmid=19066624}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Global fisheries landings peaked in the late 1980s, but are now declining, despite increasing fishing effort.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Fish biomass and average trophic level of fisheries landing are decreasing, leading to declines in marine biodiversity. In particular, local extinctions have led to declines in large, long-lived, slow-growing species, and those that have narrow geographic ranges &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Biodiversity declines can lead to associated declines in ecosystem services.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10081">'''Moore Industries-International, Inc.''' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.miinet.com&lt;/ref&gt; is in the [[process control]], [[system integration]], and factory [[automation]] industries. 

Since 1968, the company has been in industrial signal interface technology. Product lines include: Signal [[Transmitters]], Isolators and Converters; Temperature [[Sensors]], Transmitters and Assemblies; Limit Alarm Trips; MooreHawke [[Fieldbus]] Interface Products; Process Controllers, Monitors and Backup Stations; I/P and P/I Converters; Smart HART Loop Interfaces and Monitors; [[Process Control]] and Distributed [[I/O]]; and Instrument Enclosure Solutions.

== History ==
Based in the [[San Fernando Valley]], Moore Industries, started out over four decades ago when company founder [[Leonard W. Moore]], wanted to solve integration problems in the process management industries. Working out of a friend’s garage, Moore designed and built the first Moore Industries SCT signal converter, which soon evolved into a product line of six signal interfaces. In 1974, he built the current headquarters in North Hills, CA to facilitate the company’s growth.

Today, Moore Industries is an international company with direct sales offices in worldwide locations including the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Australia, and the People's Republic of China. These offices oversee an expansive network of independent representatives and agents serving every corner of the globe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miinet.com/aboutus/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980's, Moore invested heavily in a before-its-time brain child called the Moore 1002. The numeric designation came from the company initials [MII] which in Roman Numerals equals 1002. The 1002 was designed to be a signal processing computer, taking the place of rack upon rack of individual signal conditioners by centralizing and offering the first ever digital processing of control signals. The 1002 was a hybrid device which stood six feet high and while it had digital internal processing, it offered true analog output on a per channel basis, not a stepped or fake analog based on digital sampling. The 1002 was massive and expensive and since each signal had to be brought in on two wires and back out on two additional wires, it was unwieldy and required a large space just for cabling. While a complete flop as a product, the 1002 pointed the way forward in signal conditioning for the future. &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=HhajBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA388&amp;lpg=PA388&amp;dq=moore+industries+1002&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tPjdmsT9K3&amp;sig=m3H726lFw_jhr1fNE2XWPtoQzUk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBWoVChMI0ZSMwpvyxgIVCu8UCh2tbAls#v=onepage&amp;q=moore%20industries%201002&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980's, Moore sought to push back market complaints over the then-industry-standard 8-week lead time for hand-soldered signal conditioners in order to meet market demand. Rather than changing production methods from hand assembly and risking a compromise to quality, Moore created the STAR Center which could stage nearly complete modules which would be assembled rapidly based on customer specifications for 48-hour shipment. This customer service came at a price of $150 per unit which in some cases was a 100% premium, but it allowed Moore to fill priority orders where the company had been losing orders due to lead time. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.miinet.com/Portals/0/Manuals/PIX_Installation_Manual_Moore_Industries.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, Moore Industries was granted [[ISO 9001]]:2008 certification for their Quality Management System by UL DQS Inc., an ANSI-ASQ Accredited Registrar.  The ISO 9001:2008 standard is the most up to date criterion for assessing an organization’s Quality Management System. Moore Industries was among the first [[Underwriters Laboratories]] ([[UL DQS]]) clients to achieve ISO 9001:2008 certification.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.automation.com/content/moore-industries-among-first-to-achieve-iso-90012008-quality-management-system-certification&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.processindustryinformer.com/Process-Industry-News-Events/Moore-Industries-Among-First-to-Achieve-ISO-90012008-Quality-Management-System-Certification&lt;/ref&gt; Other products to receive UL certification include the miniMOORE Multi-Channel Signal Conditioners.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miinet.com/whatsnew/news_releases/09015a.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of Moore Industries’ products have also been certified by exida for use in Safety Instrumented Systems to [[IEC 61508]]:2010. This includes the SIL 3-capable STA Safety Trip Alarm and the SIL 2-capable SRM Safety Relay Module.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miinet.com/WhatsNew/MediaRoomwithNewsReleases.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Approval from exida provides independent verification of the integrity of the STA from a leader in industrial safety certifications and ensures that it meets the industry safety standards specified in IEC 61058: Parts 1, 2 and 3.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miinet.com/Portals/0/Press/STA_Receives_SIL_3_Approval_from_Exida_News_Release_Moore_Industries.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, company founder [[Leonard W. Moore]] became an Honorary Member for the [[International Society of Automation]] (ISA). The Honorary Member distinction is the highest honor bestowed by the Society. Moore received his Honorary Member distinction for contributions in the advancement of the arts and sciences of automation over a 40-year career of innovation, product development, and business leadership at Moore Industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isa.org/Content/NavigationMenu/General_Information/Honors_and_Awards1/Professional_Service_Awards1/Honorary_Member1/Honorary_Member.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608005449/http://www.isa.org/Content/NavigationMenu/General_Information/Honors_and_Awards1/Professional_Service_Awards1/Honorary_Member1/Honorary_Member.htm |archivedate=2011-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a high table dinner, Moore was presented with a lapel pin by the ISA for his lifetime achievements. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.isa.org/news-and-press-releases/press-releases/2009/june/30-june--isa-honors-and-awards-honorees-announced/&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was named as No. 15 in the San Fernando Valley Business Journal’s March 16, 2009 listing of the top manufacturing companies in the San Fernando Valley.&lt;ref&gt;http://sfvbj.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miinet.com/whatsnew/articles/SFVBJ_3-09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; On March 16, 2011, Moore Industries received the Manufacturing Leadership Award from the San Fernando Business Journal, reflecting its position as one of the most innovative manufacturing companies in the region&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miinet.com/whatsnew/news_releases/09022a.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14894">Naphthalene poisoning (or mothball poisoning) is a form of poisoning that occurs when [[naphthalene]] is ingested. Severe poisoning can result in [[Hemolytic anemia|haemolytic anaemia.]]{{cn|date=November 2018}} Naphthalene was introduced in 1841 by Rossbach as as an antiseptic to counteract [[typhoid fever]]. Although naphthalene was widely used industrially, only 9 cases of poisoning were reported since 1947, as a result, the condition was had limited coverage within medical journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gidron|first=E.|last2=Leurer|first2=J.|date=1956|title=NAPHTHALENE POISONING|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673656911527|journal=The Lancet|volume=267|issue=6910|pages=228–230|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(56)91152-7|issn=0140-6736|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources of Exposure ==
Until the late 1950s coal tar was the principal source of naphthalene. In 1981-83 the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health found numbers over 100,000 workers were potentially exposed to toxic levels of naphthalene, working primarily for major industrial and agricultural businesses. Exposure may often be a result of oral ingestion, inhalation, or through prolonged skin exposure.

===Industrial chemistry===
Naphthalene is a precursor in the production of [[phthalic anhydride]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jia|first=Chunrong|last2=Batterman|first2=Stuart|last3=Jia|first3=Chunrong|last4=Batterman|first4=Stuart|date=2010-07-20|title=A Critical Review of Naphthalene Sources and Exposures Relevant to Indoor and Outdoor Air|url=https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/7/7/2903|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|language=en|volume=7|issue=7|pages=2903–2939|doi=10.3390/ijerph7072903|pmc=2922736|pmid=20717549}}&lt;/ref&gt; This application has been displaced by alternative technologies.

===Mothballs===
[[Naphthalene]] is a major component of some [[mothball]]s.  It repels moths as well as some animals.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Since mothballs that contain naphthalene are considered hazards, safer alternatives have been developed, such as the use of [[1,4-Dichlorobenzene|1,4-dichlorobenzene]], however, 1,4-dichlorobenzene has been delcared as a potential neurotoxin. 1,4-dichlorobenzene has been linked to potentially causing depression as a form of encephalopathy. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=Suzanne B.|last2=Dwight-Johnson|first2=Megan|last3=Levy|first3=Mitchell R.|date=2010|title=Mothball induced encephalopathy presenting as depression: it's all in the history|journal=General Hospital Psychiatry|volume=32|issue=3|pages=341.e7–341.e9|doi=10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2009.04.008|pmid=20430245|issn=0163-8343}}&lt;/ref&gt; This complication resulted with an increased use of Camphor as a moth repellent. [[Camphor]] is frequently used in place of naphthalene in Asia.

====Regulation====
The European Union enforced a ban on the distribution and production of mothballs containing naphthalene in 2008, as a part of the new regulations of the Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH), regulating chemical use within its representative countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3463893/Holy-straight-bananas-now-the-Eurocrats-are-banning-moth-balls.html|title=Holy straight bananas – now the Eurocrats are banning moth balls|last=Reporter|first=Andrew Alderson, Chief|date=2008-11-15|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, New Zealand banned the distribution of mothballs after the Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=11267602|title=Mothballs banned due to toxic risk|date=2014-06-04|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mothballs are restricted within Australia, only being distributed in forms that prevent them from being ingested.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-02-national-mothballs-naphthalene-brain-babies.html|title=National ban on mothballs containing naphthalene may prevent brain damage in babies|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tobacco===
Tobacco is also a source of exposure, creating an estimated range of 0.3 to 4 micrograms of naphthalene inhalation per cigarette that is consumed. A regular pack a day smoker on average would be inhaling amounts of 6-80 micrograms of naphthalene daily, which is a small and negligible amount of naphthalene, and is similar in magnitude to normal exposure near highways and areas where car exhaust is frequently inhaled or consumed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Price|first=Paul S.|last2=Jayjock|first2=Michael A.|date=2008|title=Available data on naphthalene exposures: Strengths and limitations|journal=Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology|volume=51|issue=2|pages=15–21|doi=10.1016/j.yrtph.2007.10.010|pmid=18078699|issn=0273-2300}}&lt;/ref&gt; The napthalene within cigarettes is different to other sources of naphthalene. The naphthalene that is produced in cigarette smoke is bound to other particles and is not presented as a free vapour, meaning the exposure is small. Napthalene exposure is usually insignificant unless exposed to large amounts of naphthalene within production or being near proximity of a product that contains naphthalene. Naphthalene levels within an area are very unstable and frequently change over time and space. Due to this variance, sampling protocols must be conducted carefully and are usually analysed using different analytical methods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Natural occurrence===
Naphthalene has also been found to be secreted by [[Termite|termites]] in order to protect their nests. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-08-09|title=Correction|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/548141a|issn=1476-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt;The termites use naphthalene to repel ants and any intruders who try to invade their nests. This naphthalene produced is not only toxic for the insects but can also affect humans in the same way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Jian|last2=Henderson|first2=Gregg|last3=Grimm|first3=Casey C.|last4=Lloyd|first4=Steven W.|last5=Laine|first5=Roger A.|date=1998|title=Naphthalene in Formosan Subterranean Termite Carton Nests|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|language=en|volume=46|issue=6|pages=2337–2339|doi=10.1021/jf9709717|issn=0021-8561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naphthalene poisoning via termite nest was featured within "''The Truth"'' , episode eleven of season one of the American television medical drama House'','' where the final diagnosis ended up as acute naphthalene poisoning as a result of a termite nest being contained within the walls of the patients room, inhaling naphthalene in his sleep and becoming sick.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sciencing.com/naphthalene-poisoning-termites-6522077.html|title=Naphthalene Poisoning and Termites|website=Sciencing|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
Treatment of naphthalene toxicity usually follows the same treatments involved for haemolytic anaemia, which involves a series of blood transfusions, in order to restore healthy levels of haemoglobin. This may include intravenous methylene blue and ascorbic acid. The methylene blue allows the methaemoglobin to be converted to haemoglobin. Supportive treatment is also usually provided, depending on the severity of the toxicity, that resulted in the anaemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kundra|first=Tanveer Singh|date=2015|title=Naphthalene Poisoning following Ingestion of Mothballs: A Case Report|url=https://jcdr.net/article_fulltext.asp?issn=0973-709x&amp;year=2015&amp;volume=9&amp;issue=8&amp;page=UD01&amp;issn=0973-709x&amp;id=6274|journal=Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research|volume=9|issue=8|pages=UD01–2|language=en|doi=10.7860/jcdr/2015/15503.6274|issn=2249-782X|pmc=4576617|pmid=26436023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ascorbic acid is used to treat methemoglobinemia, a symptom of naphthalene poisoning and is used when methylene blue is not available, or in conjunction with methylene blue in order to restore haemoglobin count.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sahu|first=Kamal Kant|last2=Dhibar|first2=Deba Prasad|last3=Gautam|first3=Archana|last4=Kumar|first4=Yogeesh|last5=Varma|first5=Subhash Chander|date=2016|title=Role of ascorbic acid in the treatment of methemoglobinemia|journal=Turkish Journal of Emergency Medicine|volume=16|issue=3|pages=119–120|doi=10.1016/j.tjem.2016.07.003|issn=2452-2473|pmc=5103054|pmid=27857990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms of toxicity ==
According to the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]], naphthalene is possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+184|title=NAPHTHALENE - National Library of Medicine HSDB Database|website=toxnet.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol82/82-06.html|title=NAPHTHALENE (IARC Summary &amp; Evaluation, Volume 82, 2002)|website=www.inchem.org|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as there is inadequate evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of naphthalene, however there is sufficient evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of naphthalene. The carcinogenicity was tested on rats in mice, via intraperitoneal administration and subcutaneous administration, of newborns and adult rats, providing evidence of tumours. The IARC also discovered that naphthalene toxicity also had potential to cause cataracts in humans, rats, rabbits and mice, however the tests were considered inefficient to substantiate a diagnosis resulting in naphthalene as a potential carcinogen classification. Likewise, the [[European Chemicals Agency|European Chemical agency]] classified naphthalene as Group C, a possible human carcinogen. This was classified due to lack of evidence of naphthalene alone causing carcinogenic properties in rats, and limited human contact with naphthalene within industrial environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/naphthalene.pdf|title=Naphthalene|last=|first=|date=2000|website=epa.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haemolysis occurs either through haemoglobin defects, such as formation of [[Heinz body|Heinz bodies]], or cell membrance defects, especially those with [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]] and a low tolerance to oxidative stress. This haemolysis is usually accompanied by neurological effects such as vertigo, lethargy and convulsions, usually caused by cerebral edema. Gastrointentinal bleeding may also appear as a symptom after ingestion of mothballs, especially for those who are younger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Annamalai|first=Karthick C|last2=Shrikiran|first2=A|last3=Mundkur|first3=Suneel C|last4=Chaitanya Varma|first4=PV|date=2012|title=Acute naphthalene toxicity presenting with metabolic acidosis: a rare complication|journal=Journal of Acute Disease|volume=1|issue=1|pages=75–76|doi=10.1016/s2221-6189(13)60018-9|issn=2221-6189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acute exposure to naphthalene is unlikely to cause toxicity and must be ingested unless prolonged contact is provided along the skin or eyes. After ingestion of mothballs containing naphthalene, symptoms of haemolytic anaemia are presented and treated normally through the use of methylene blue and regular blood transfusions, and patients are usually released after 6-10 days depending on their haemoglobin levels.

Repeated naphthalene exposure has also been found to potentially cause airway epithelial damage, aberrant repair, and inflammation. Greater numbers of peribronchial Mac-3-positive macrophages and CD3-positive T-cells were observed throughout the airways which displays acute inflammation within the airways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aoshiba|first=Kazutetsu|last2=Tsuji|first2=Takao|last3=Itoh|first3=Masayuki|last4=Semba|first4=Seitaro|last5=Yamaguchi|first5=Kazuhiro|last6=Nakamura|first6=Hiroyuki|last7=Watanabe|first7=Hidehiro|date=2014|title=A murine model of airway fibrosis induced by repeated naphthalene exposure|journal=Experimental and Toxicologic Pathology|volume=66|issue=4|pages=169–177|doi=10.1016/j.etp.2014.01.001|pmid=24480153|issn=0940-2993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naphthalene metabolites of 1,2-hydroxynaphthalene has also been found to be a mechanism of oxidative DNA damage within humans. In the presence of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ohnishi|first=Shiho|last2=Hiraku|first2=Yusuke|last3=Hasegawa|first3=Keishi|last4=Hirakawa|first4=Kazutaka|last5=Oikawa|first5=Shinji|last6=Murata|first6=Mariko|last7=Kawanishi|first7=Shosuke|date=2018-03-01|title=Mechanism of oxidative DNA damage induced by metabolites of carcinogenic naphthalene|journal=Mutation Research/Genetic Toxicology and Environmental Mutagenesis|volume=827|pages=42–49|doi=10.1016/j.mrgentox.2018.01.005|pmid=29502736|issn=1383-5718}}&lt;/ref&gt;The damaging activity of the DNA of the activity of 1,2-hydroxynaphthalene was observed at much larger levels. 1,2-hydroxynaphthalene is reduced by NADH to be formed as a part of the redox cycle, resulting in the speeding up of DNA damage, however, this is only presented within larger prolonged exposure to naphthalene, values that are unrealistic for any individual not working near a place where naphthalene production occurs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Biomarkers of excessive exposure ===
1,2-Dihydroxynaphthalene has been used as a potential biomarker of excessive exposure to naphthalene levels and was tested on smokers and those exposed to naphthalene among the working population. After collecting the urine samples of multiple workers, Median 1,2-Dihydroxynaphthalene values were 1012 micrograms per litre for those exposed to naphthalene and 8 micrograms per litre for those who were in the control group indicating that it is useful as a biomarker for exposure within humans. The median results for the concentrations of 1,2-Dihydroxynaphthalene were about ten times the amount of the standard markers of 1-naphthol and 2-naphthol within human urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klotz|first=Katrin|last2=Angerer|first2=Jürgen|date=2016|title=Quantification of naphthoquinone mercapturic acids in urine as biomarkers of naphthalene exposure|journal=Journal of Chromatography B|volume=1012-1013|pages=89–96|doi=10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.12.052|pmid=26812176|issn=1570-0232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klotz|first=Katrin|last2=Schindler|first2=Birgit Karin|last3=Angerer|first3=Jürgen|date=2011|title=1,2-Dihydroxynaphthalene as biomarker for a naphthalene exposure in humans|journal=International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health|volume=214|issue=2|pages=110–114|doi=10.1016/j.ijheh.2010.11.003|pmid=21147027|issn=1438-4639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oxalis Triangularis Photonasty Timelapse.ogv|thumb|right|300px|Photonastic movement of ''[[Oxalis triangularis]]'' in response to light. At lowered light levels the leaves fold down; timelapse recorded at ~750x actual speed and covering a 1.5 hr period of time.]]

'''Nastic movements''' are non-directional [[Stimulus (psychology)|responses]] to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] (e.g. [[temperature]], [[humidity]], light [[irradiance]]), and are usually associated with [[plant]]s. The movement can be due to changes in [[turgor]] or changes in growth . Nastic movements differ from [[Tropism|tropic movements]] in that the direction of tropic responses depends on the direction of the stimulus, whereas the direction of nastic movements is independent of the stimulus's position. The tropic movement is growth movement but nastic movement may or may not be growth movement. The rate or [[frequency]] of these responses increases as intensity of the stimulus increases. An example of such a response is the opening and closing of flowers (photonastic response), movement of euglena, chlamydomonas towards the source of light. They are named with the suffix "-nasty" and have prefixes that depend on the stimuli:
* Epinasty: downward-bending from growth at the top, for example, the bending down of a heavy flower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://botanydictionary.org/epinasty.html epinasty - Dictionary of botany&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hyponastic response|Hyponasty]]
* Photonasty: response to light
* [[Nyctinasty]]: movements at night or in the dark
* Chemonasty: response to chemicals or nutrients
* Hydronasty: response to water
* Thermonasty: response to temperature&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Thermonasty in Tulip and Crocus Flowers|url = http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/1/65|journal = Journal of Experimental Botany|date = 1953-01-01|issn = 0022-0957|pages = 65–77|volume = 4|issue = 1|doi = 10.1093/jxb/4.1.65|language = en|first = W. M. L.|last = Wood}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Geonasty/gravinasty: response to gravity
* [[Thigmonasty]]/seismonasty/haptonasty: response to contact

The suffix may come from Greek νάσσω = "I press", ναστός = "pressed", ἐπιναστια = "the condition of being pressed upon".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5330">'''Nathan A. Scott Jr.''' (24 April 1925 – December 2006) was an American scholar who helped establish the modern field of theology and literature and who helped found the well-known Ph.D. program in that field at the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Terry. "Religion and Literature from the Modern to the Postmodern: Scott, [[George Steiner|Steiner]] and [[Robert Detweiler (scholar)|Detweiler]]". ''Literature and Theology'' 19.1 (2005) 3-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott also published seventeen books, in addition to publishing articles and reviews and editing editions.&lt;ref name="Carrigan"&gt;[http://www.bibliobuffet.com/content/view/738/285/ "Remembering Nathan Scott"] by Henry L. Carrigan, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt; He has likewise been the subject of numerous articles and books.

Scott's innovation in literary criticism was to reject the [[New Criticism|New Critics']] idea that poems should be studied as autonomous objects and to remind scholars that authors' personal beliefs are crucial for understanding their texts; in this way, he also returned criticism to a study of the way literature represents the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;Hesla, David H.

Accessed through JSTOR: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1462220 18 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott earned his B.A. at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1944, his B.D. at [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] in 1946, and his Ph.D at [[Columbia University]] in 1949, having studied under [[Lionel Trilling]], [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], and [[Jacques Barzun]].&lt;ref name="Carrigan"/&gt; He served as dean of the chapel at [[Virginia Union University]] and was an ordained priest in the Episcopal Church.

{{cquote|Along with [[Stanley Romaine Hopper]] at Drew University, [[Preston Roberts]] and '''Nathan A. Scott Jr.''' at the University of Chicago established the emerging interdisciplinary field that became known variously as religion and literature, theology and literature, or Christianity and literature. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, theologians found themselves looking to the literature of the post-World War II period for articulate expressions of theological themes such as despair, alienation, redemption, and revelation. Drawing primarily on Paul Tillich’s theology of culture—which defined religion as the substance of culture and culture as the form of religion—Scott eloquently explored the crisis of faith in modern literature, the climate of faith in Kafka, Camus, and Bellow, and the themes of alienation and reconciliation in modern plays, poetry, and novels. Scott taught several generations of students that a dialogue with the literary imagination of the age would provide rich rewards for Christian theology by offering a deepening awareness of itself and the time in which it finds itself. In one of his most eloquent and astute observations, Scott pointed out that the sense that the anchoring center of life is broken and that the world is abandoned and adrift is a basic premise underlying most of our literature.}}

The '''New Alchemy Institute''' was a research center that did pioneering investigation into [[organic agriculture]], [[aquaculture]], and [[bioshelter]] design between 1969 and 1991. It was founded by [[John Todd (Canadian biologist)|John Todd]], Nancy Jack Todd, and William McLarney. Its purpose was to research human support systems of food, water, and shelter and to completely rethink how these systems were designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Alastair|title=Remembering Jay Baldwin, experimental geodesic dome champion - Archpaper.com|url=https://archpaper.com/2018/04/remembering-jay-baldwin/|accessdate=18 May 2018|work=archpaper.com|date=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose of the Institute==

The New Alchemy Institute was founded on a {{convert|12|acre|m2|adj=on}}, former dairy farm in [[Falmouth, Massachusetts|Hatchville]], [[Massachusetts]] on [[Cape Cod]]. Their stated aim was to do research on behalf of the planet: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Among our major tasks is the creation of ecologically derived human support systems - [[renewable energy]], agriculture [[aquaculture]], housing and landscapes. The strategies we research emphasize a minimal reliance on [[fossil fuel]]s and operate on a scale accessible to individuals, families and small groups. It is our belief that ecological and social transformations must take place at the lowest functional levels of society if humankind is to direct its course towards a greener, saner world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our programs are geared to produce not riches, but rich and stable lives, independent of world fashion and the vagaries of international economics. The New Alchemists work at the lowest functional level of society on the premise that society, like the planet itself, can be no healthier than the components of which it is constructed. The urgency of our efforts is based on our belief that the industrial societies which now dominate the world are in the process of destroying it." (Fall 1970, Bulletin of the New Alchemists. [http://www.thegreencenter.net/newalchemy.html])
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Areas of research==

===Bioshelters===

A [[bioshelter]] is a solar greenhouse that is managed as a self-contained [[ecosystem]].  The groupings of plants, animals, soil and insects are selected so that closed loops of life cycles, materials, water, and energy are created, and require minimal inputs from outside the system.  They emulate natural rhythms of growth and cycling of nutrients.

New Alchemy built several bioshelters:

* "The Ark" located at the property in [[Falmouth, Massachusetts|Hatchville, Massachusetts]], United States
* "The Ark" located at [[Little Pond, Prince Edward Island|Spry Point, Prince Edward Island]], Canada
* others

===Organic agriculture===
New Alchemy investigated the practices of organic agriculture for both field crops, and greenhouse growing. They researched intensive gardening, biological pest control, cover cropping, irrigation using fish pond water, perennial food crops, and tree crops.

===Aquaculture===
New Alchemy experimented with growing edible fish  in ponds in the bioshelters. The solar aquaculture ponds were  above-ground, translucent tanks. The fertile pond water was used for irrigating the crops in the greenhouses. This proved to be a successful way to raise edible fish, floating hydroponic crops, and irrigated greenhouse food crops.

==Ideological basis==
The scientists working at New Alchemy were determined to rethink how human support systems were designed. They looked to nature as the ultimate designer, using careful observation of natural cycles and processes as the template for creating truly sustainable systems.

==Publications==
The research conducted at New Alchemy was documented in a series of journals and technical bulletins.  A complete list is available at: [http://www.thegreencenter.net New Alchemy Institute]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3929">The '''nozzle and flapper mechanism''' is a displacement type detector which converts mechanical movement into a pressure signal, by covering the orifice of a '''nozzle''' with a flat plate called the '''flapper'''.&lt;ref&gt;Singh p481 on&lt;/ref&gt; This restricts the nozzle fluid flow and generates a pressure signal.

It is a widely used mechanical means of creating a high gain fluidic amplifier. In [[industrial control systems]] they played an important part in the development of pneumatic [[PID controller]]s and are still widely used today in pneumatic and hydraulic control and [[instrumentation]] systems.

==Operating principle==
[[File:Nozzle and flapper open and closed loop.png|thumb|Basic mechanism of nozzle and flapper pneumatic displacement detector.]]
The operating principle makes use of the high gain effect when a "flapper" plate is placed a small distance from a small pressurised nozzle emitting a fluid.
 
The example shown is pneumatic. At sub-millimetre distances a small movement of the flapper plate results in a large change in flow. The nozzle is fed from a chamber which is in turn fed by a restriction, so changes of flow result in changes of chamber pressure. The nozzle diameter must be larger than the restriction orifice in order to work.&lt;ref&gt;Singh p 481&lt;/ref&gt; The high gain of the open loop mechanism can be linearised using a pressure feedback bellows on the flapper to create a force balance system with a linear output. The "live" zero of 0.2 bar or 3 psi is set by the bias spring which ensures that the device is working in its linear region.

The industry standard ranges of either 3-15 psi (USA), or 0.2 - 1.0 bar (metric), is normally used in pneumatic PID controllers, valve positioner [[servomechanism]]s and force balance transducers.

==Application==
[[File:Nozzle and flapper proportional controller.png|thumb|Schematic showing nozzle and flapper used in a proportional controller context with field devices.]]
[[Image:Pneumatische regelaar.jpg|thumb|Pneumatic PID (three term) controller. The nozzle and flapper mechanism made these possible.]]
The nozzle and flapper in pneumatic controls is a simple low maintenance device which operates well in a harsh industrial environment, and does not present an explosion risk in hazardous atmospheres. They were the industry controller amplifier for many decades until the advent of practical and reliable electronic high gain amplifiers. However they are still used extensively for field devices such as [[control valve]] positioners, and I to P and P to I converters.

A proportional controller schematic is shown here.

The set point is transmitted through the flapper plate via the fulcrum to close the orifice and increase the chamber pressure. The feedback bellows resists and the output signal goes to the control valve which opens with increasing actuator pressure. As the flow increases, the process value bellows counteracts the set point bellows until equilibrium is reached. This will be a value below the set point, as there must always be an error to generate an output. The addition of an integral or "reset" bellows would remove this error.&lt;ref&gt;Singh p 488&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle is also used in hydraulic systems controls.

'''Objectivity''' is a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] concept of being [[wikt:true|true]] independently from [[subject (philosophy)|individual]] [[subjectivity]] caused by perception, emotions, or imagination. A proposition is considered to have '''objective truth''' when its truth conditions are met without bias caused by a [[sentience|sentient]] subject. [[Objectivity (science)|Scientific objectivity]] refers to the ability to judge without partiality or external influence, sometimes used synonymously with ''[[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]]''.

== Objectivity of knowledge ==
&lt;!-- 'Rhetorical situation' points here --&gt;
[[Plato]] considered [[geometry]] a condition of [[Platonic idealism|idealism]] concerned with [[universal (metaphysics)|universal]] truth. His contrasting between objectivity and [[doxa|opinion]] became the basis for philosophies intent on resolving the questions of [[reality]], [[truth]], and [[existence]]. He saw opinions as belonging to the shifting sphere of [[sensibility|sensibilities]], as opposed to a fixed, eternal and knowable [[incorporeality]]. Where Plato distinguished between [[epistemology|how we know things]] and their [[ontology|ontological]] status, [[subjectivism]] such as [[George Berkeley]]'s depends on [[perception]]. In [[Platonism|Platonic]] terms, a criticism of subjectivism is that it is difficult to distinguish between knowledge, opinions, and [[Subjectivity|subjective]] knowledge.

Platonic idealism is a form of [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] objectivism, holding that the [[idealism|ideas exist independently]] from the individual. Berkeley's [[empiricism|empirical]] idealism, on the other hand, holds that [[subjectivism|things only exist as they are perceived]]. Both approaches boast an attempt at objectivity. Plato's definition of objectivity can be found in [[Platonic epistemology|his epistemology]], which is based on [[mathematics]], and [[Universal_(metaphysics)#Platonic_realism|his metaphysics]], where knowledge of the ontological status of objects and ideas is resistant to change.

In opposition to philosopher [[René Descartes]]' method of [[Cogito, ergo sum|personal deduction]], natural philosopher [[Isaac Newton]] applied the relatively objective [[scientific method]] to look for [[scientific evidence|evidence]] before forming a hypothesis. Partially in response to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s [[rationalism]], logician [[Gottlob Frege]] applied objectivity to his epistemological and metaphysical philosophies. If reality exists independently of [[consciousness]], then it would logically include a plurality of [[intension|indescribable]] forms. Objectivity requires a definition of [[truth]] formed by propositions with [[truth value]]. An attempt of forming an objective [[world view|construct]] incorporates [[ontological commitment]]s to the reality of objects.

The importance of perception in evaluating and understanding objective reality is debated in the [[Observer_effect_(physics)#Quantum_mechanics|observer effect]] of quantum mechanics. [[Direct and indirect realism|Direct]] or [[Naïve realism|naïve realist]]s rely on perception as key in observing objective reality, while [[instrumentalism|instrumentalists]] hold that observations are useful in predicting objective reality. The concepts that encompass these ideas are important in the [[philosophy of science]]. [[philosophy of mind|Philosophies of mind]] explore whether objectivity relies on [[Consensus reality|perceptual constancy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tyler Burge]], ''Origins of Objectivity'', Oxford University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectivity in ethics==

===Ethical subjectivism===
{{See also|David Hume|Non-cognitivism|Subjectivism}}
The term, "ethical subjectivism", covers two distinct theories in ethics. According to cognitive versions of ethical subjectivism, the truth of moral statements depends upon people's values, attitudes, feelings, or beliefs. Some forms of cognitivist ethical subjectivism can be counted as forms of realism, others are forms of anti-realism. David Hume is a foundational figure for cognitive ethical subjectivism. On a standard interpretation of his theory, a trait of character counts as a moral virtue when it evokes a sentiment of approbation in a sympathetic, informed, and rational human observer. Similarly, Roderick Firth's [[ideal observer theory]] held that right acts are those that an impartial, rational observer would approve of. William James, another ethical subjectivist, held that an end is good (to or for a person) just in the case it is desired by that person (see also [[ethical egoism]]). According to non-cognitive versions of ethical subjectivism, such as emotivism, prescriptivism, and expressivism, ethical statements cannot be true or false, at all: rather, they are expressions of personal feelings or commands. For example, on [[Alfred Ayer|A. J. Ayer's]] emotivism, the statement, "Murder is wrong" is equivalent in meaning to the emotive, "Murder, Boo!"

===Ethical objectivism===
{{Main|Moral realism}}
According to the ethical objectivist, the [[truth]] or falsehood of typical moral judgments does not depend upon the beliefs or feelings of any person or group of persons. This view holds that moral propositions are analogous to propositions about chemistry, biology, or history, in so much as they are true despite what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, or feels. When they fail to describe this mind-independent moral reality, they are false—no matter what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, or feels.

There are many versions of ethical objectivism, including various religious views of morality, Platonistic intuitionism, [[Kantianism]], [[utilitarianism]], and certain forms of [[ethical egoism]] and [[contractualism]]. Note that Platonists define ethical objectivism in an even more narrow way, so that it requires the existence of intrinsic value. Consequently, they reject the idea that contractualists or egoists could be ethical objectivists. Objectivism, in turn, places primacy on the origin of the frame of reference—and, as such, considers any arbitrary frame of reference ultimately a form of ethical subjectivism by a transitive property, even when the frame incidentally coincides with reality and can be used for measurements.

[[File:Kentish Flats 185488397 729bb056f4 o.jpg|thumb|Offshore wind farm]]
[[File:Oil platform P-51 (Brazil).jpg|thumb|Oil platform]]
'''Offshore construction''' is the installation of structures and facilities in a marine environment, usually for the production and transmission of electricity, oil, gas and other resources. It is also called '''maritime engineering'''. 

Construction and pre-commissioning is typically performed as much as possible onshore. To optimize the costs and risks of installing large offshore platforms, different construction strategies have been developed.

One strategy is to fully construct the offshore facility onshore, and tow the installation to site floating on its own buoyancy. Bottom founded structure are lowered to the seabed by de-ballasting (see for instance [[Condeep]] or [[Cranefree]]), whilst [[Floating Production Storage and Offloading|floating structures]] are held in position with substantial [[Mooring (watercraft)|mooring]] systems.

The size of offshore lifts can be reduced by making the construction modular, with each module being constructed [[:wikt:onshore|onshore]] and then lifted using a [[crane vessel]] into place onto the platform. A number of very large crane vessels were built in the 1970s which allow very large single modules weighing up to 14,000 tonnes to be fabricated and then lifted into place.

Specialist floating hotel vessels known as [[flotel]]s are used to accommodate workers during the construction and hook-up phases. This is a high cost activity due to the limited space and access to materials.

[[Oil platform]]s are key fixed installations from which drilling and production activity is carried out. [[Drilling rig]]s are either floating vessels for deeper water or [[jack-up]] designs which are a barge with liftable legs.&lt;ref name="P D Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Bevan, John|title=The Professional Divers's Handbook|edition=second|year=2005|publisher=Submex Ltd|location=5 Nepean Close, Alverstoke, GOSPORT, Hampshire PO12 2BH |language=English|isbn= 978-0950824260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these types of vessel are constructed in marine yards but are often involved during the construction phase to pre-drill some production wells. 
Other key factors in offshore construction are the [[weather window]] which defines periods of relatively light weather during which continuous construction or other offshore activity can take place. [[Safety]] is another key construction parameter, the main hazard obviously being a fall into the sea from which speedy recovery in cold waters is essential.

The main types of vessels used for pipe laying are the "[[Derrick Barge]] (DB)", the "[[Pipelay Barge]] (LB)" and the "Derrick/Lay barge (DLB)" combination. Diving bells in offshore construction are mainly used in water depths greater than {{convert|120|ft|-1}}, less than that, the divers use a metal basket driven from an "A" frame from the deck. The basket is lowered to the water level, then the divers enter the water from it to a maximum of {{convert|120|ft|-1}}. Bells can go to {{convert|1500|ft}}, but are normally used at {{convert|400|to|800|ft}}.

Offshore construction includes [[Offshore geotechnical engineering|foundations engineering]], structural design, construction, and/or repair of offshore structures, both commercial and military, including:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4064">'''On Line Opinion''', or Online Opinion, is an [[open access]] [[electronic journal]], specialising in social and political debate. The journal is published in Australia, although content is not necessarily limited to Australian issues, and extends at times to publication in wider areas, such as, religion, ethics, and philosophy.

== History ==

On Line Opinion was established in 1999 by political commentator Graham Young.&lt;ref name="Flew&amp;Young"&gt;Flew, T. and G. Young. 2004. [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/393/ 'If they come they will build it: Managing and building e-democracy from the ground up']. ''Proceedings of the Australian Electronic Governance Conference''.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, On Line Opinion has become recognized as one of the leading examples of [[alternative journalism]]&lt;ref&gt;Forde, S. 2011. ''[https://he.palgrave.com/page/detail/challenging-the-news-susan-forde/?sf1=barcode&amp;st1=9780230243569 Challenging the News: The Journalism of Alternative and Community Media]''. p9. 2011. Basingstoke: [[Palgrave Higher Education]]. {{ISBN|978-0230243569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[citizen journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A. and J. Cokley. 2013. [http://ejournalist.com.au/v13n2/TaylorCokley.pdf 'How citizen journalism websites are working in Australia: news and discussion']. ''Ejournalist: a Refereed Media Journal''. Vol.13, No.2.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the report of the Independent Inquiry into Media and Media Regulation by the Hon [[Raymond Antony Finkelstein]] QC stated that: "While the start-up costs for new print publications have been prohibitive and inhibited new enterprises emerging, the streamlining of the relationship between content producers and consumers has led to many new websites and web-based services. Among the most important such websites that have grown up in Australia over the last decade are ''[[Inside Story (Australian TV program)|Inside Story]]'', ''[[Australian Policy Online]]'', Online Opinion, ''[[The Drum (TV program)|The Drum]]'', ''[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]'', and [[New Matilda]]."&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein, R. March 2012. [http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/1205_finkelstein.pdf Report of the Independent Inquiry into the Media and Media Regulation]. Retrieved 19/2/16.&lt;/ref&gt; The journal is referenced by the [[Australian National Library]],&lt;ref&gt;Australian National Library Catalogue: See http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4395745.&lt;/ref&gt; with {{ISSN|1442-8458}}.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Public Affairs Information Service, [http://www.nla.gov.au/apais/jourandconf.html Electronic Journals and Conferences]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==

On Line Opinion was founded as an experiment in [[participatory democracy]], through the means of [[participatory journalism]].&lt;ref name="Flew&amp;Young"/&gt; The contributors to On Line Opinion constitute a wide range of writers, such as what might be described as high-profile contributors, including politicians and academics, and what might be called ordinary citizens, that is, those with no particular public profile.&lt;ref&gt;See list of authors at: http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/author.asp&lt;/ref&gt; One of the motivations behind On Line Opinion was to address the limitations of [[academic publishing]], and thus On Line Opinion aims to publish accessible material, sometimes called [[grey literature]], on a more timely basis and with a wider audience, than would otherwise be the case. Research has suggested that, in comparative terms, publication within On Line Opinion is indeed more timely than is the case with other citizen journals, with on average five new articles per day appearing on the website.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A. and J. Cokley. 2013. [http://ejournalist.com.au/v13n2/TaylorCokley.pdf 'How citizen journalism websites are working in Australia: news and discussion']. ''Ejournalist: a Refereed Media Journal''. Vol.13, No.2. p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Palaeoimmunology''' or '''paleo-immunology''' ("''paleo''"=ancient, "''immuno''"=referring to [[immunology]]) is the analysis using [[Immunohistochemistry|histochemical]] techniques to look at the [[matrix protein]]s in historic and [[pre-historic]] materials.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Modern [[Immunoassay|immunological assays]] are used to detect the presence of specific [[antigen]]s in the sample material.

== Examples of use ==
Paleo-immunology encompasses a variety of immunoassays performed on a diverse array of archaeological materials. Paleo-immunology is a new, growing field that is still being properly defined. Examples of paleo-immunology as they appear in peer reviewed literature are as follows:
* The extraction and analysis of [[Collagen|collagen peptides]] from fossilized bones.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 
* The use of [[immunofluorescence]] and [[Immunohistochemistry|immunohistochemical]] techniques in order to study the proteins of the [[extracellular matrix]] found in mummified tissues. This was done to further understand the physiologic and pathologic alterations that can occur in preserved prehistoric tissues.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; 
* A plague dipstick assay was used to detect the presence of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] antigens in medieval French graves. This paleo-immunological assay is also known as a "rapid diagnostic test for the plague" (RDT).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kacki|first=Sacha|last2=Rahalison|first2=Lila|last3=Rajerison|first3=Minoarisoa|last4=Ferroglio|first4=Ezio|last5=Bianucci|first5=Raffaella|year=2011|title=Black Death in the rural cemetery of Saint-Laurent-de-la-Cabrerisse Aude-Languedoc, southern France, 14th century: immunological evidence|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440310003675|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=38|issue=3|pages=581–587|via=|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2010.10.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Passage to Nirvana, A Survivor's Zen Voyage: Reflections on Loss, Discovery, Healing &amp; Hope''''' is a memoir by [[Lee Carlson]], written over a several year period from 2005-2010 primarily on board a 60-foot sailboat named Nirvana that he shared with his fiancée Meg.  It was his first book, although he had made his living as a writer for most of his adult life, working first as a journalist, magazine editor and freelance writer, and then moving into advertising and marketing copywriting. The book centers around Carlson's [[Traumatic Brain Injury]] and subsequent recovery, as well as his mother's death from a [[Traumatic Brain Injury]]. However the book is much more far-ranging, delving into such subjects as [[Zen Buddhism]], [[sailing]], [[divorce]], [[children]], [[family]] and even [[poetry]]. Ultimately it is a book about finding peace and happiness after a traumatic life event, a book about finding the joy in living.

==Plot summary==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lee-5 3 2small.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Carlson in 2011.]] --&gt;
''Passage to Nirvana'' begins with Carlson's accident, when he was hit by a car standing outside a car wash, striking his head violently on the pavement, fracturing his skull, lapsing into a light coma and sustaining a Traumatic Brain Injury, with bleeding on the brain and other damage. The story follows him through his brief hospitalization, then a year-long rehab in Florida, then his return to the North Fork of Long Island where he tries to rebuild his shattered life. His wife has left him and moved away with their children, his business has evaporated, he has no home and has to begin with noting to renew his life. During his year in Florida he also helps care for his mother, who is severely disabled from her own traumatic brain injury sustained when she fell down a flight of basement stairs. She is in a wheelchair, unable to walk, talk or feed herself. While he is in Florida, his mother eventually dies. Upon returning to Long Island, more misfortunes seem to continue: his aunt dies of cancer, as does his brother-in-law, and he returns to Buffalo to help his sister and her children while his brother-in-law is in the hospital.

{{rquote|right|"I'm a believer in storytelling, I think the human mind has always learned from storytelling — from Grendel to Aesop's Fables to the Arabian Nights. Storytelling helps us organize our world.|Lee Carlson in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.buffalonews.com/life/health-parenting/article245999.ece | title=Finding 'Nirvana' in a haze of traumatic brain injury | publisher= [[The Buffalo News]]| date=November 9, 2010| accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While this may sound morbid and depressing, the bulk of the book is uplifting, a positive affirmation of life. Carlson concentrates on his Zen Buddhist studies and meditation as a way of helping him heal, working with the noted writer and Zen teacher [[Peter Matthiessen]]. Sections of the book take place in the Ocean Zendo, a Zen center run by Matthiessen, and much of the book is a meditation on the spiritual aspects of healing, acceptance and rebuilding a life. Eventually Carlson meets a beautiful, understanding woman who has been through difficulties of her own: a difficult divorce, raising two children as a single mother. They fall in love, and decide to buy a sailboat named "Nirvana" that they discover rotting in a boatyard in [[St. Martin]]. They renovate the boat, sail her back to the eastern end of Long Island, where they are joined by their four children and two dogs, working at creating a new family and a new life. Eventually they sail "Nirvana" to the Bahamas for a winter writing sabbatical, where most of the book was written.

Trying to describe the "plot" is difficult, however, as the book is really a collection of short essays, some about events happening in real time, some about Traumatic Brain Injury, some reflections on various aspects of philosophy and Eastern thought, and some stories recalling the author's childhood. See the section "Unique Writing Style" below for more information.

==Unique writing style==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:NirvanaInsideBook.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The unique creative layout of the book, with each chapter preceded by a very short poem Carlson calls a "Po."]] --&gt;
The book is written as a series of short, interconnected essays, many of them short, short stories no more than a few pages long, using some example from Carlson's life and recovery as a kind of moral fable. Most of the chapters are preceded by exceedingly short poems, often consisting of only three or four words, that Carlson calls a "Po." The narrative of the book is not linear, and in the book's introduction Carlson says that much of the book's unique style came from how his brain functioned during his recovery. The Po because initially he could not remember long sentences; the short chapters because he could not remember longer chapters, and the non-linear narrative because that's how his mind was functioning, having trouble concentrating on any one thing for long periods of time. As such the narrative jumps back and forth, loops around in time, and is refreshingly inventive and interesting. At the same time, each short chapter is designed as a stand-alone essay, so the reader can pick up the book, turn to any chapter and read it as a kind of short story.

==Background and publication==
Written during 2005-2010, and published in [[2010 in literature|2010]], ''Passage to Nirvana'' was rejected by a number of mainstream publishers and agents, due to its unusual writing style and layout. Because of his background in magazine publishing, Carlson decided to form his own publishing company, Henry Chapin and Sons, to publish and market the book. Given his interest in new technology, the internet, and the rapidly changing publishing business, he also decided to use the new crowdfunding paradigm for raising money to publish the book, and raised nearly $13,000 from small, individual donors using the arts funding web site [[kickstarter]].&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Julie (2010-1-20). [http://suffolktimes.timesreview.com/2010/10/644/local-authors-go-the-self-publish-route/ "Local authors go the self-publish route." ''The Suffolk Times'']. Retrieved March 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He then used Facebook, as well as the worldwide network of Amazon.com sites such as Amazon Japan as a way of marketing the book and reaching out to a worldwide readership, where the book found a following, gathering fans from not only the U.S., but from Canada, Mexico, Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, the U.K., Ireland, France, Italy, Russia, Poland, Morocco, South Africa, Croatia, India, Nepal, Indonesia, Japan, Australia and other countries.

==Reviews and criticism==
''Passage to Nirvana'' has received positive reviews. One reviewer said, "Mr. Carlson is playful with words, which is part of the enchantment of his po-etics, or short poems, called po. With titles like “Passage to Nirvana” and “The Book of Po,” they made me think of “Passage to India” and “Life of Pi.” The references lead by imagination to the land of origin for Buddhism, or so I take it. Mr. Carlson’s journey is graced with whimsy, like a good south wind with the sail in a reach and spray in your face....The writing here is lucid, with a light touch — light of heart." &lt;ref&gt;Stuart, Rev. Robert (2011-3-10)[http://www.easthamptonstar.com/dnn/Arts/OntheRoadtoSomewhere/tabid/14386/Default.aspx "On the Road to Somewhere." ''The East Hampton Star''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316082756/http://www.easthamptonstar.com/dnn/Arts/OntheRoadtoSomewhere/tabid/14386/Default.aspx |date=2011-03-16 }}. Retrieved March 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reviewer said "No one is perfect, and realizing this is the first step in finding that second opportunity in life. "Passage to Nirvana: A Survivor's Zen Voyage: Reflections on Loss, Discovery, Healing &amp; Hope" is an inspirational and spiritual read from Lee Carlson. Recovering from a traumatic brain injury, he found new joy in life and found his own passage to joy in life through many arts of Zen. Thoughtful and riveting reading, "Passage to Nirvana" is an enlightening and educational read that shouldn't be overlooked for those looking for their own second chances." &lt;ref&gt;(2011-01). [http://www.midwestbookreview.com/sbw/jan_11.htm#Religion/Spirituality ''Midwest Book Review''].Retrieved March 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third review called ''Passage to Nirvana'' "An inspirational story of how love and the strength of the human spirit can triumph over adversity, Passage to Nirvana is a reminder to cherish every day and never forget that our health is, indeed, our wealth."&lt;ref&gt;(2011-01). [http://windcheckmagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=947:passage-to-nirvana&amp;catid=93:book-review&amp;Itemid=425 "Passage to Nirvana." ''Windcheck Magazine''].  Retrieved March 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the book is ostensibly about recovering from Traumatic Brain Injury, the spiritual nature of the book is one thing that seems to have captured many people's attention. There is the review in the East Hampton Star that was written by a minister (see first review above), and on the book's website there are many reviews and testimonials from people with two testimonials from religious teachers standing out: “Amazing, Really Amazing. I Want to Share it With Others.” -Rabbi John Linder, Temple Solei; and “Deserves to be Hailed As A Unique and Lasting Contribution to American Letters.” -Reverend Thomas Yorty, Westminster Presbyterian Church. The book has received all five-star reviews on Amazon.com.

The '''Picower Institute for Learning and Memory''' is, along with the [[McGovern Institute for Brain Research]] and the Department of Brain and [[Cognitive Science]]s, one of the three [[neuroscience]] groups at [[MIT]]. The institute is focused on studying all aspects of learning and memory; specifically, it has received over [[US$]]50 million to study [[Alzheimer's]], [[schizophrenia]] and similar diseases.

When it was established in 1994, the institute was primarily funded by the [[Sherman Fairchild Foundation]], the [[RIKEN Brain Science Institute]] and the [[National Institute of Mental Health]].&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://web.mit.edu/picower/about/index.html|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was renamed after a $50 million grant by the [[Jeffry Picower#Involvement with Bernard Madoff|Picower Foundation]] in 2002. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/uwire/uwire_WFR051720027396405.html?pagewanted=all&amp;position=top&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Professional development''' is learning to earn or maintain professional [[credentials]] such as [[academic degrees]] to formal coursework, attending conferences, and [[informal learning]] opportunities situated in practice. It has been described as intensive and collaborative, ideally incorporating an evaluative stage.&lt;ref&gt;Speck, M. &amp; Knipe, C. (2005) ''Why can't we get it right? Designing high-quality professional development for standards-based schools''(2nd ed.). Thousand Oaks: Corwin Press{{qn|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of approaches to professional development, including consultation, coaching, [[communities of practice]], lesson study, mentoring, reflective supervision and technical assistance.&lt;ref name="community.fpg.unc.edu"&gt;National Professional Development Center on Inclusion. (2008). [http://fpg.unc.edu/node/4611 "What do we mean by professional development in the early childhood field?"]. Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina, FPG Child Development Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The [[University of Management and Technology (United States)|University of Management and Technology]] notes the use of the phrase "professional development" from 1857 onwards.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In the training of school staff in the United States, "[t]he need for professional development [...] came to the forefront in the 1960s".&lt;ref&gt;

==Participants==
A wide variety of people, such as teachers, military officers and non-commissioned officers, health care professionals, lawyers, accountants and engineers engage in professional development. Individuals may participate in professional development because of an interest in lifelong learning, a sense of moral obligation, to maintain and improve professional competence, to enhance career progression, to keep abreast of new technology and practices, or to comply with professional regulatory requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Golding, L. &amp; Gray, I. (2006).''Continuing professional development for clinical psychologists:A practical handbook''. The British Psychological Society. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jasper, M.

==Professional school==
A professional school is a graduate school level institution that prepares students for careers in specific fields. Some of the schools also offer undergraduate degrees in specific professions. Examples of this type of school include:
[[List of international architecture schools|Architecture school]], [[Business school]], [[Divinity school]], [[Engineering school]], [[Journalism school]], [[Law school]], [[Library school]], [[School of education|Education school]] ([[Normal school]]), [[Public policy school]] and [[Council on Social Work Education|Social work school]]. The field of healthcare has many professional schools including [[Medical school]], [[Chiropractic school]], [[Dental school]], [[Pharmacy school]], [[Physician Assistant|Physician Assistant school]], [[Physiotherapy|Physiotherapy school]], [[Podiatric medical school]], [[Public health#Schools of public health|Public health school]], [[Speech-Language Pathology]] School, [[Occupational therapy|Occupational therapy school]], [[Nursing school]], [[Veterinary school]] and [[List of optometry schools|Optometry school]].

==Approaches==
In a broad sense, professional development may include ''formal'' types of vocational education, typically post-secondary or poly-technical training leading to qualification or credential required to obtain or retain employment. Professional development may also come in the form of pre-service or in-service professional development programs. These programs may be formal, or informal, group or individualized. Individuals may pursue professional development independently, or programs may be offered by human resource departments. Professional development on the job may develop or enhance process skills, sometimes referred to as leadership skills, as well as task skills. Some examples for process skills are 'effectiveness skills', 'team functioning skills', and 'systems thinking skills'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garet|first1=M. S.|last2=Porter|first2=A. C|last3=Desimone|first3=L.|last4=Birman|first4=B. F|last5=Yoon|first5=K. S.|title=What Makes Professional Development Effective? Results From a National Sample of Teachers|journal=American Educational Research Journal|date=1 January 2001|volume=38|issue=4|pages=915–945|doi=10.3102/00028312038004915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Connecting Coaches to Corporates|url=https://twofold.asia/|website=twofold.asia|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional development opportunities can range from a single workshop to a semester-long academic course, to services offered by a medley of different professional development providers and varying widely with respect to the philosophy, content, and format of the learning experiences.  Some examples of approaches to professional development include:&lt;ref name="community.fpg.unc.edu"/&gt;

*'''Case Study Method''' – The case method is a teaching approach that consists in presenting the students with a case, putting them in the role of a decision maker facing a problem {{Harv|Hammond|1976}} – See [[Case method]].
*'''Consultation''' – to assist an individual or group of individuals to clarify and address immediate concerns by following a systematic problem-solving process.
*'''Coaching''' – to enhance a person’s competencies in a specific skill area by providing a process of observation, reflection, and action.
*'''Communities of Practice''' – to improve professional practice by engaging in shared inquiry and learning with people who have a common goal
*'''Lesson Study''' – to solve practical dilemmas related to intervention or instruction through participation with other professionals in systematically examining practice
*'''Mentoring''' – to promote an individual's  awareness and refinement of his or her own professional development by providing and recommending structured opportunities for reflection and observation
*'''Reflective Supervision''' – to support, develop, and ultimately evaluate the performance of employees through a process of inquiry that encourages their understanding and articulation of the rationale for their own practices
*'''Technical Assistance''' – to assist individuals and their organization to improve by offering resources and information, supporting networking and change efforts.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] on the future of work &lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work.]&lt;/ref&gt; argues that professional development opportunities for those both in and out of work, such as flexible learning opportunities at universities and adult learning programs, enable labor markets to adjust to the future of work.

==Initial==
Initial professional development (IPD) is defined as "a period of development during which an individual acquires a level of [[Skill|competence]] necessary in order to operate as an autonomous professional".&lt;ref&gt;The UK Initial Professional Development (IPD) Forum http://www.littlerichley.eclipse.co.uk/ukipdforum/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Professional associations]] may recognise the successful completion of IPD by the award of [[chartered (professional)|chartered]] or similar status. Examples of professional bodies that require IPD prior to the award of professional status are the [[Institute of Mathematics and its Applications]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ima.org.uk/activities/professional/initial_professional_development_ipd.cfm.html |title=Initial Professional Development (IPD) |publisher=The Institute of Mathematics and its Applications |accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Institution of Structural Engineers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istructe.org/careers-and-development/professional-development/initial-professional-development |title=Initial Professional Development |publisher=The Institution of Structural Engineers |accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Institution of Occupational Safety and Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iosh.co.uk/Membership/About-membership/Professional-development/About-IPD.aspx |title=Membership: About membership: Professional development: About IPD |publisher=[[Institution of Occupational Safety and Health|(IOSH)]] |accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuing==
Continuing professional development (CPD) or continuing professional education (CPE) is [[continuing education]] to maintain knowledge and skills. Most [[profession]]s have CPD obligations. Examples are the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rics.org/uk/about-rics/what-we-do/continuing-professional-development/ |title=About RCIS: What we do: Continuing professional development (CPD) |publisher=[[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]] |accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American Academy of Financial Management]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialanalyst.org/ce.html|title=GAFM ®  Certified Financial Analyst Certification  Risk Certified Financial Planner Books GAFM ® -  AFA Accredited Financial Analyst ® Certification - AMA Accredited Management Accountant  ® - MMC Master Management Consultant ® Chartered Economist - Continuing Ed|website=www.financialanalyst.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; safety professionals with the [[International Institute of Risk &amp; Safety Management]] (IIRSM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iirsm.org/become_a_member/membership_levels |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927010130/http://www.iirsm.org/become_a_member/membership_levels |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Institution of Occupational Safety and Health]] (IOSH),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iosh.co.uk/Membership/About-membership/Professional-development/About-CPD.aspx |title=Membership: About membership: Professional development: About CPD |publisher=[[Institution of Occupational Safety and Health|(IOSH)]] |accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and medical and legal professionals, who are subject to [[continuing medical education]] or [[continuing legal education]] requirements, which vary by jurisdiction.

The '''Richardson Institute for Peace Studies''' was the first [[Peace and conflict studies|peace &amp; conflict]] research centre in the UK and one of the first in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/ppr/research/research-centres/richardson-institute/ |title= Department of Politics, Philosophy, and Religion: Research Centres |accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the Department of Politics, Philosophy, and Religion at [[Lancaster University]], where its members publish research, hold lectures and workshops, and run academic outreach programmes.

==History==
The Richardson Institute began as an independent organisation, the '''Lancaster Peace Research Centre''', in the [[North of England]] in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=EBzxsURb4-cC&amp;q=richardson+institute#v=snippet&amp;q=richardson%20institute&amp;f=false |work= Journal of Peace Research |title= Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace, and Conflict |accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jpr.sagepub.com/content/51/2/145.full.pdf |work= Journal of Peace Research |title= Peace Research – Just the Study of War?|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre was incorporated first into the Politics Department at Lancaster University, and then in 1969 into a branch of the Conflict Research Society at the [[University of Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://conflictresearchsociety.org/history/  |title= The Conflict Research Society: History |accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/n1879/pdf/book.pdf?referer=1879  |title= War, Strategy, and History |accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There the Centre was renamed the '''Richardson Institute for Conflict and Peace Research''' in honour of the polymath and pacifist [[Lewis Fry Richardson]], and was moved to 158 North Gower St, London, which it shared with the [[Women’s Research and Resources Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb106-7pac  |title= Papers of Pat Caplan |accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time the Institute not only published academic papers, but also released an animated film about the nature of human communication in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://library.sl.nsw.gov.au/search~S2?/dAnimated+films./danimated+films/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=danimated+films+united+states&amp;7%2C%2C23 |work= State Library of New South Wales |title= Communicate or Else |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 1978, with funding from the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]], the Institute returned to Lancaster University as an autonomous body of the Politics Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bisa.ac.uk/files/BISA%20News/Autumn_1978_Issue_9.pdf |work= British International Studies Association Newsletter |title= Autumn 1978, No.9 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There its activities diversified into undergraduate and postgraduate teaching, ultimately leading to the creation of a [[studentship]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alumni.lancs.ac.uk/document.doc?id=14 |work= Steps |title= Summer 2007 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its early [[Minor (academic)|minor course]] in conflict &amp; peace research proved particularly popular, and the Institute became renowned for lecturing in "unashamedly [[Behavioural sciences|behavioural]]" models of social science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bisa.ac.uk/files/BISA%20News/Spring_1980_Issue_13.pdf |work= British International Studies Association Newsletter |title= Spring 1980 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 the members of the Institute consolidated their work by publishing ''A Reader in Peace Studies'', a basic text that became set reading for many introductory peace studies courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmu.edu/programs/icar/ijps/vol3_1/Harris.htm |title= A Portrait of University Peace Studies in North America and Western Europe at the End of the Millennium |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this new activity, the Institute was given the more general trade name of the '''Richardson Institute for Peace Studies'''.

As the Institute shared more of the Politics Department’s day-to-day teaching responsibilities, its other activities declined. With funding from the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]], the Institute was re-launched in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://results.ref.ac.uk/DownloadFile/EnvironmentTemplate/PDF?subId=1764 |work= Research Excellence Framework 2014 |title= Lancaster University: Theology and Religious Studies |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 it began the Richardson Institute Internship Programme, a year-long, multidisciplinary research placement with such partners as the [[Institute for Strategic Dialogue]] and the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], and in 2016 it opened a course in the [[Political theology|political theology of peace]] as the first in a number of [[distance learning]] modules on positive politics. The Institute also hosts an annual peace lecture series and runs a film club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/fass/centres/richinst/ |title= www.lancaster.ac.uk/fass/centres/richinst |accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its present aim is to become an international partner of choice for universities and to improve the public understanding of peace. Since 2012 the Institute has published on such diverse topics as [[Indo-Pak relations]], sexuality in the [[Anglican Church]], and maritime [[Cyberwarfare|cyber operations]], and the [[ESRC]] has rated its research as outstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/ppr/research/research-centres/richardson-institute/#publications |title= Richardson Institute Publications |accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/clippings/richardson-institute-research-rated-as-outstanding-by-the-esrc(336a53aa-b8e1-4a7e-aae9-c063dedce4a0).html |work= Lancaster University Research Directory |title= Richardson Institute Research Rated as 'Outstanding' by the ESRC |accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6643">The '''barrier effect''' of roads and highways is a phenomenon usually associated with [[landscape ecology]], referring to the barrier that linear infrastructure like [[roads]] or [[railways]] place on the movement of animals. Largely viewed as a negative process, the barrier effect has also been found to have several positive effects, particularly with smaller species.&lt;ref name="positive-effects"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Downing |first1=R.J. |last2=Rytwinski |first2=T |last3=Fahrig |first3=L |date=2015 |title= Positive effects of roads on small mammals: a test of the predation release hypothesis |url= |journal=Ecological Research |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=651-662 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce a road or railway's barrier effect, [[wildlife crossings]] are regarded as one of the best mitigation options, ideally in combination with wildlife fencing.&lt;ref name="positive-effects"/&gt; The barrier effect is closely linked to [[habitat fragmentation]] and [[road ecology]].

==Effects on wildlife==

===Negative effects===

====Roads====
Both existing roads and the construction of new highways act as barriers for many species, fragmenting the surrounding habitat to such a degree that connectivity, or the ability for an animal to travel to all areas of its home range, is made practically impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dupras |first1=J |last2=Marull |first2=J |last3=Parcerisas |first3=L |last4=Coll |first4=F |last5=Gonzalez |first5=A |last6=Girard |first6=M |last7=Tello |first7=E |date=2016 |title= The impacts of urban sprawl on ecological connectivity in the Montreal Metropolitan Region |url= |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Policy |volume=58 |issue= |pages=61-73 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, animals with a higher [[vagility]], or ability to travel long distances, are more severely impacted by roads compared to species with smaller home ranges.

====Railways====
While very few studies have analyzed the effect of railways on animal movement, their presence across landscapes in most areas of the world suggests that they likely pose a significant barrier for many species. Most studies relating to this sub-field focus on animal use of [[culverts|drainage culverts]] underneath railway networks. For example, Rodriguez et al. (1996) found that nearly 80% of culverts in their study received visits by both [[mammals]] and [[reptiles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van Rodriguez |first1=A |last2= Crema |first2=G |last3=Delibes |first3=M|date=1996 |title= Use of non-wildlife passages across a high speed railway by terrestrial vertebrates |url= |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |volume= |issue= |pages=1527-1540 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Land-use types====
Although few studies have analyzed the effect of land type on animal movement, those that exist have found man-made clearings and agricultural land to be strong barriers for many species who may only travel within forested landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laurance |first1=W.F. |last2=Lovejoy |first2=T.E. |last3=Vasconcelos |first3=H.L. |last4=Bruna |first4=E.M. |last5=Didham |first5=R.K. |last6=Stouffer |first6=P.C. |last7=Gascon |first7=C |last8=Bierregaard |first8=R |last9=Laurence |first9=S.G. |last10=Sampaio |first10=E |date=2002 |title= Ecosystem decay of Amazonian forest fragments: a 22‐year investigation |url= |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=16 |issue= 3|pages=605-618 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positive effects===
12% of studies analyzing the effects of roads on animals have found positive effects, indicating that some species benefit from the presence of roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fahrig |first1=L |last2= Rytwinski |first2=T |date=2009 |title= Effects of roads on animal abundance: an empirical review and synthesis |url= |journal=Ecology and Society |volume=14 |issue= 1|pages=21 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[predation release hypothesis]], suggesting that roads may indirectly cause increases in abundances of animals whose predators are negatively affected by road,&lt;ref name="positive-effects"/&gt; is often attributed to most positive effects of roads on animals. 

==Mitigation measures==

===Driver behavior===
Studies have found that reducing the speed at which drivers travel along the road produces less noise, potentially reducing the road's barrier effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van Langevelde |first1=F |last2= van Dooremalen |first2=C |last3=Jaarsma |first3=C.F.|date=2009 |title= Traffic mortality and the role of minor roads |url= |journal=Journal of Environmental Management |volume=90 |issue= 1|pages=660-667 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction in noise coming from the highway is assumed to make the road surface less intimidating for animals, potentially allowing crossings to take place. This increase in crossings, however, may result in a subsequent increase in animal-vehicle collisions.

===Animal movement===
Wildlife crossings, such as wildlife overpasses or underpasses, are generally seen as the most effective mitigation measure to help make roads more passable for wildlife while increasing both driver and animal safety. To funnel wildlife towards these crossings, many studies have called for a combination of both wildlife crossings and exclusion fencing, making the crossings under or over the road the only available path for wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Olsson |first1=M.P. |last2= Widen |first2=P |date=2008 |title= Effects of highway fencing and wildlife crossings on moose Alces alces movements and space use in southwestern Sweden |url= |journal=Wildlife Biology |volume=14 |issue= 1|pages=111-117 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yanes |first1=M |last2= Velasco |first2=J.M. |last3= Suarez |first3=F |date=1995 |title= Permeability of roads and railways to vertebrates: the importance of culverts |url= |journal=Biological conservation |volume=73 |issue= 3|pages=217-222 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With a combination of both wildlife crossings and suitable lengths of fencing, the barrier effect of roads is expected to decrease, allowing animals to access both sides of the road and therefore allowing for important life cycle  processes including migration and mating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beben|first1=D |date=2012 |title= Crossings for animals–an effective method of wild fauna conservation |url= |journal=Journal of environmental engineering and landscape management |volume=20 |issue= 1|pages=86-96 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson''''' is a 1990 work about sexual [[decadence]] in [[Western literature]] and the [[visual arts]] by scholar [[Camille Paglia]], in which the author addresses major artists and writers such as [[Donatello]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Edmund Spenser]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Lord Byron]], [[Emily Brontë]], and [[Oscar Wilde]]. Following Nietzsche, Paglia argues that the primary conflict in Western culture is between the binary forces of the [[Apollonian and Dionysian]], [[Apollo]] being associated with order and symmetry, and [[Dionysus]] with chaos, disorder, and nature. The book received critical reviews from numerous feminist scholars, but was praised by some literary critics.

==Background==

By Paglia's own account, the ancestor of ''Sexual Personae'' was a book on aviator [[Amelia Earhart]] that she began to write in high school. Paglia's discovery of [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s ''[[The Second Sex]]'' in 1963 inspired her to write a book larger in scope. ''Sexual Personae'' began to take shape in essays Paglia wrote in college between 1964 and 1968. The title was inspired by [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s film ''[[Persona (1966 film)|Persona]]'', which Paglia saw on its American release in 1968. The work was finished in 1981, but was rejected by seven major New York publishers before being released by [[Yale University Press]] in 1990. Paglia credits editor Ellen Graham with securing Yale's decision to publish the book. The original preface to ''Sexual Personae'' was removed at the suggestion of Yale editors because of the book's extreme length, but was later published in Paglia's essay collection ''Sex, Art, and American Culture'' (1992).&lt;ref name="Paglia2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Paglia, Camille |title=Sex, Art, and American Culture: Essays |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |year=1993 |pages=xi, xii, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115 |isbn=0-14-017209-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paglia describes the method of ''Sexual Personae'' as psychoanalytic and acknowledges a debt to the work of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]]. Her other major influences were [[James George Frazer|Sir James George Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890), [[Jane Ellen Harrison|Jane Harrison]]'s ''Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion'' (1903), [[Oswald Spengler]]'s ''[[The Decline of the West]]'' (1918), [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Women in Love]]'' (1920), [[Sándor Ferenczi]]'s ''Thalassa'' (1924), the works of literary critics [[G. Wilson Knight]] and [[Harold Bloom]], [[Erich Neumann (psychologist)|Erich Neumann]]'s ''[[The Great Mother]]'' (1955) and ''[[The Origins and History of Consciousness]]'' (1949), [[Kenneth Clark]]'s ''The Nude'' (1956), [[Gaston Bachelard]]'s ''[[The Poetics of Space]]'' (1958), [[Norman O. Brown]]'s ''[[Life Against Death]]'' (1959) and ''[[Love's Body]]'' (1966), and [[Leslie Fiedler]]'s ''Love and Death in the American Novel'' (1960). Paglia also acknowledges [[astrology]] as an influence.&lt;ref name="Paglia2" /&gt;

Paglia said of her objectives with the book, "It was intended to please no one and to offend everyone. The entire process of the book was to discover the repressed elements of contemporary culture, whatever they are, and palpate them. One of the main premises was to demonstrate that [[pornography]] is everywhere in major art. Art history as written is completely sex free, repressive and puritanical. I want precision and historical knowledge, but at the same time, I try to zap it with pornographic intensity."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in "20Q: Camille Paglia" by Warren Kalbacker in ''Playboy'' magazine (October 1991); also in Gauntlet # 4 (1992), p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Paglia seeks to demonstrate "the unity and continuity of western culture". Accepting the canonical western tradition, she "rejects the modernist idea that culture has collapsed into meaningless fragments." Paglia argues that [[Christianity]] did not destroy [[paganism]], which flourishes in art, eroticism, astrology, and popular culture. She examines [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], the [[Renaissance]], and [[Romanticism]] from the late eighteenth century to 1900, contending that "Romanticism turns almost immediately into [[Decadent movement|Decadence]]." She believes that the "amorality, aggression, sadism, voyeurism, and pornography in great art have been ignored or glossed over by most academic critics" and that sex and nature are "brutal pagan forces." She also stresses the truth in sexual stereotypes and the biological basis of sexual difference, noting that her stance is "sure to cause controversy." Paglia sees the mother as an overwhelming force who condemns men to lifelong sexual anxiety, from which they fleetingly escape through [[rationalism]] and physical achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Paglia, Camille |title=Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson |publisher=Yale University Press |location=London |year=1990 |pages=xiii |isbn=0-300-04396-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portraying Western culture as a struggle between [[phallic]], [[Sky deity|sky-religion]] on the one hand, and [[chthonic]], [[Fertility goddess|earth-religion]] on the other, Paglia draws on the Greco-Roman polarity between the Apollonian and Dionysian. She associates Apollo with order, structure, and symmetry, and Dionysus with chaos, disorder, and nature. She analyzes literature and art from the premise that the primary conflict in Western culture has always been between these forces. In her view, the major patterns of continuity in western culture find their origin in paganism.  Other sources of continuity include [[androgyny]], sadism, and the aggressive "western eye," which seeks to refine and dominate nature's ceaseless hostility and thus has created our art and cinema.  Paglia criticizes feminists for sentimentality or wishful thinking about the causes of [[rape]], violence, and poor relations between the sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Paglia, Camille |title=Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson |publisher=Yale University Press |location=London |year=1990 |pages=1–2 |isbn=0-300-04396-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "sexual personae" of Paglia's title include the female vampire ([[Medusa]], [[Lauren Bacall]]); the pythoness (the [[Delphic Oracle]], [[Gracie Allen]]); the beautiful boy ([[Hadrian]]'s [[Antinous]], [[Dorian Gray]]); the epicene man of beauty (Byron, [[Elvis Presley]]); and the male heroine (the passive male sufferer; for example, the old men in [[William Wordsworth]]'s poetry).&lt;ref name="Paglia1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Paglia, Camille |title=Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson |publisher=Yale University Press |location=London |year=1990 |pages=vii–viii, 311, 312 |isbn=0-300-04396-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers Paglia discusses include Spenser, Shakespeare, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], the [[Marquis de Sade]], Goethe, [[William Blake]], Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[John Keats]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[Théophile Gautier]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]], Brontë, [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], [[Walter Pater]], Wilde, [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Walt Whitman]], [[Henry James]], and [[Emily Dickinson]]. The works of literature Paglia devotes attention to include Spenser's ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', Shakespeare's ''[[As You Like It]]'' and ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', Goethe's ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]'', Coleridge's ''[[Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'', Byron's ''[[Don Juan]]'', Brontë's ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', Wilde's ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' and ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Paglia, Camille |title=Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson |publisher=Yale University Press |location=London |year=1990 |pages=2, 3, 6, 24, 35, 41, 43, 46, 49, 61, 99, 115, 132, 157, 173, 187, 265, 320, 408, 448, 543 |isbn=0-300-04396-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Works of art to which Paglia applies her analysis of the Western canon include: the ''[[Venus of Willendorf]]'', the [[Nefertiti Bust]], [[Ancient Greek sculpture]], Donatello's ''[[David (Donatello)|David]]'', Botticelli's ''[[Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|Birth of Venus]]'' and ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'', da Vinci's ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' and ''[[The Virgin and Child with St. Anne (Leonardo)|The Virgin and Child with St. Anne]]''.&lt;ref name="Paglia1" /&gt; Paglia questions the sociologist [[Max Weber]]'s definition of [[charisma]], according to which it is a power that must be manifested in heroic deeds or miracles, writing that she sees charisma as "the numinous aura around a narcissistic personality" and "the radiance produced by the interaction of male and female elements in a gifted personality", rather than something dependent upon "acts or external effects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Paglia, Camille |title=Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson |publisher=Yale University Press |location=London |year=1990 |page=521 |isbn=0-300-04396-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
''Sexual Personae'' was first published in hardcover by [[Yale University Press]] in 1990. It was published by [[Vintage Books]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Paglia, Camille |title=Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson |publisher=Yale University Press |location=London |year=1990 |page=iv |isbn=0-300-04396-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Feminist responses===
''Sexual Personae'' received critical reviews from numerous feminist scholars. Robin Ann Sheets wrote that Paglia "takes a profoundly anti-feminist stance."&lt;ref name="Sheets"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sheets | first = Robin Ann | title = Book Reviews: ''Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson'' by Camille Paglia | journal = [[Journal of the History of Sexuality]], special issue, Part 1: The State, Society, and the Regulation of Sexuality in Modern Europe | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 205–298 | publisher = [[University of Texas Press]] | date = October 1991 | jstor = 3704039 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Molly Ivins]] wrote a critical review of ''Sexual Personae'', accusing Paglia of historical inaccuracy, egocentrism, and writing in sweeping [[generalization]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ivins | first = Molly | author-link = Molly Ivins | title = I Am the Cosmos | journal = [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 8–10 | publisher = [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Foundation For National Progress]] | date = September–October 1991 | url = http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/editorials/9207131221/am-cosmos | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teresa Ebert denounced the book as "deeply misogynist and rancorous" in the ''Women's Review of Books'', writing that Paglia uses a biological basis to "justify male domination, violence, and superiority in Western culture."&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Ebert | first = Teresa L. | title = Review: The Politics of the Outrageous | journal = [[Wellesley College#Wellesley Centers for Women|The Women's Review of Books]] | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–13 | publisher = [[Wellesley College#Wellesley Centers for Women|Wellesley Centers for Women]] | doi = 10.2307/4021115 | jstor = 4021115 | date = October 1991 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4021115 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; English professor [[Sandra Gilbert]] described ''Sexual Personae'' as "markedly monomaniacal ... bloated, repetitious" and "awkwardly written," adding that the book is "so '[[essentialism|essentialist]]' as to outbiologize even Freud."  Gilbert accused Paglia herself of being guilty of "vulgar [[homophobia]]" and deserving of "moral contempt," and notes that Paglia "loathes liberalism, egalitarianism, feminism, and Mother Nature."&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gilbert | first = Sandra M. | author-link = Sandra M.

The critic [[Helen Vendler]] gave ''Sexual Personae'' a negative review in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', writing that while Paglia could be "enlightening and entertaining" when dealing with a subject congenial to her, she failed in her discussions of subjects that demanded more than appreciation of images and stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vendler, Helen|title=Feminism and Literature|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1990/05/31/feminism-and-literature/|website=Nybooks.com|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a letter of protest from Paglia, Vendler denied that ''Sexual Personae'' constituted poetry criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vendler, Helen, et al|title=Feminism and Literature: An Exchange|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1990/08/16/feminism-and-literature-an-exchange/|website=Nybooks.com|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Terry Teachout]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', described ''Sexual Personae'' as flawed, but "every bit as intellectually stimulating as it is exasperating".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date= July 22, 1990 |title=Siding With the Men |first=Terry |last=Teachout}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist [[Anthony Burgess]] wrote of ''Sexual Personae'', "A fine, disturbing book. It seeks to attack the reader's emotions as well as his/her prejudices. It is very learned. Each sentence jabs like a needle."&lt;ref name="yalepress" /&gt; Harold Bloom wrote, "''Sexual Personae'' will be an enormous sensation of a book, in all of the better senses of ’sensation.’ There is no book comparable in scope, stance, design, or insight. It compels us to rethink the question of the literary representation of human sexuality."&lt;ref name="yalepress"&gt;{{cite web | title = ''Sexual Personae'' | url = http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/reviews.asp?isbn=9780300043969 | website = yalepress.yale.edu | publisher = [[Yale University Press]] | deadurl = bot: unknown | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208171013/http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/reviews.asp?isbn=9780300043969 | archivedate = 2015-12-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The American Religion]]'' (1992), Bloom described Paglia's book as a "masterwork" and credited her with a "shrewd and alarming sexual definition of charisma", though he also wrote that its "powerful sexual reductiveness ... necessarily produces distortions when applied to the personality of any prophet whosoever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bloom | first = Harold | author-link = Harold Bloom | title = The American religion: the emergence of the post-Christian nation |pages=97–8 | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | location = New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780671867379 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novelist [[Gore Vidal]] declared that based on the quotations he had read, ''Sexual Personae'' "sounds like [[Myra Breckinridge]] on a roll.

Gerald Gillespie called ''Sexual Personae'' "vigorous and capacious," and wrote of Paglia, "Her passion for her subject matter [...] radiates as a beacon of hope for the survival of the Western heritage beyond the current Babylonian captivity of the American academy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gillespie | first = Gerald | title = Book Reviews: ''Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson'' by Camille Paglia | journal = Comparative Literature | volume = 45 | issue = 2 | pages = 180–184 | publisher = [[Duke University Press]] | doi = 10.2307/1771438 | jstor = 1771438 | date = Spring 1993 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1771438 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] wrote in ''[[Who Stole Feminism?]]'' (1994) that ''Sexual Personae'' should have led to Paglia being "acknowledged as an outstanding woman scholar even by those who take strong exception to her unfashionable views", and criticized the ''Women's Review of Books'' for calling the book a work of "crackpot extremism" and feminist professors at [[Connecticut College]] for comparing it to German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sommers | first = Christina Hoff | author-link = Christina Hoff Sommers | title = Who stole feminism?: how women have betrayed women  |page=133 | publisher = Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster | location = New York | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780684801568 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Dale Pendell]], the classical scholar Norman O.

The novelist [[John Updike]] wrote that ''Sexual Personae'' "feels less a survey than a curiously ornate harangue. Her percussive style — one short declarative sentence after another — eventually wearies the reader; her diction functions not so much to elicit the secrets of books as to hammer them into submission... The weary reader longs for the mercy of a qualification, a doubt, a hesitation; there is little sense, in her uncompanionable prose, of exploration occurring before our eyes, of tentative motions of thought reflected in a complex syntax."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Updike | first = John | author-link = John Updike | title = More matter: essays and criticism | publisher = Fawcett Books | location = New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780449006283 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The jurist [[Richard Posner]] called ''Sexual Personae'', "an insightful book, written in a lively manner, though opinionated, uneven, and often difficult to follow", and compared it to [[Allan Bloom]]'s ''[[The Closing of the American Mind]]'' (1987), writing that they are both examples of "difficult academic works that mysteriously strike a chord with a broad public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Posner | first = Richard | author-link = Richard Posner | title = Public intellectuals: a study of decline |page=103 | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780674006331 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropologist [[Melvin Konner]] wrote that ''Sexual Personae'' is "a powerful account of gender as depicted in Western art and literature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Konner | first = Melvin | author-link = Melvin Konner | title = The tangled wing: biological constraints on the human spirit |page=501 | publisher = Henry Holt and Co | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780805072792 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, according to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', the singer [[David Bowie]] listed ''Sexual Personae'' among his hundred favorite books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date= January 11, 2016 |title=Remembering David Bowie through his 100 favorite books |url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-remembering-david-bowie-100-books-20160111-story.html |first=Michael |last=Schaub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of the SPE began well before its actual establishment. During the decade after the 1901 discovery of the Spindletop field, the American Institute of Mining Engineers ([[American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers|AIME]]) saw a growing need for a forum in the booming new field of petroleum engineering. As a result, AIME formed a standing committee on oil and gas in 1913.

In 1922, the committee was expanded to become one of AIME's 10 professional divisions. The Petroleum Division of AIME continued to grow throughout the next three decades. By 1950, the Petroleum Division had become one of three separate branches of AIME, and in 1957 the Petroleum Branch of AIME was expanded once again to form a professional society.

SPE became tax-exempt in March 1985. 

The first SPE Board of Directors meeting was held 6 October 1957, making 2007 the 50th anniversary year for SPE as a professional society. 6 October 2017 was the 60th anniversary of SPE. In the last sixty years SPE has endeavored to provide resources to petroleum engineers where they need them most. SPE continues to operate more than 100 events around the world, and publish technically relevant information online, in-print, and delivered to their member inboxes. SPE offers a wide array of awards and scholarships to recognize industry champions and future leaders. 

== Membership ==

=== Books ===
SPE has published many books over the years. The ''Petroleum Engineering Handbook''(''PEH'') was a seven-volume series SPE published. The individual handbooks are still available in digital and print formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://store.spe.org/PE-handbooks-C7.aspx|title=PE handbooks|website=store.spe.org|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

SPE continues to publish new books on practical applications of new technologies that may be used to produce oil and natural gas more efficiently. SPE book authors sometimes attend book signings at the Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition. SPE's bookstore offers books on drilling, enhanced oil recovery, and reservoir characterization. SPE members receive a significant discount on purchases through the SPE Bookstore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spe.org/members/benefits.php|title=Professional Membership Benefits {{!}} Society of Petroleum Engineers|website=www.spe.org|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==PetroWiki==
PetroWiki was created from the seven-volume ''Petroleum Engineering Handbook''. PetroWiki preserves ''PEH'' content in unaltered form (page names that start with PEH:), while allowing SPE's membership to update and expand content from the published version. Pages that do not have "PEH:" at the beginning may have started with content from the PEH, but have been modified over time by contributors to the wiki.

Content in PetroWiki is moderated by at least two members with subject matter expertise. This helps to ensure that the information found in PetroWiki is technically accurate.

Unlike some other online wikis, PetroWiki content is copyrighted by SPE.

== OnePetro ==
Launched in March 2007, OnePetro.org is a multi-society library that allows users to search for and access a broad range of technical literature related to the oil and gas exploration and production industry. OnePetro is a multi-association effort that reflects participation of many organizations. The Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) operates OnePetro on behalf of the participating organizations. SPE operates and provides customer service support for OnePetro.

OnePetro currently contains more than 200,000 documents, with more being added frequently. The number of documents is expected to grow as additional organizations choose to make their materials available through OnePetro. OnePetro is the first online offering of documents from some organizations, making these materials widely available for the first time.

The following organizations currently have their technical documents available through OnePetro:
* [[American Petroleum Institute]] (API)
* [http://armarocks.org/ American Rock Mechanics Association (ARMA)]
* [[American Society of Safety Engineers]] (ASSE)
* BHR Group
* [http://www.isope.org/ International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers] (ISOPE)

==SPE Petroleum Engineering Certification==
The [[SPE Certified Petroleum Professional|SPE Petroleum Engineering Certification]] program was instituted as a way to certify petroleum engineers by examination and experience. This certification is similar to the Registration of Petroleum Engineers by state in the United States.

Certified professionals use "SPEC" after their name.

== Industry resources ==
=== Petroleum reserves and resources definitions ===
The Society of Petroleum Engineers has developed a system for evaluating oil and gas reserves and resources. The Petroleum Resources Management System (PRMS) is used by oil and gas companies in determining their reserves and serves as the primary basis for reporting rules established by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spe.org/industry/docs/Petroleum_Resources_Management_System_2007.pdf Petroleum Resources Management System]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Salary survey ===
SPE conducts an annual survey of members across the globe to learn more about the compensation petroleum engineers receive. In 2017, SPE found that the average salary (base pay) for a petroleum engineer was USD $151,122.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spe.org/industry/oil-and-gas-salary-survey/|title=Oil and Gas Pay {{!}} Salary Survey {{!}} Society of Petroleum Engineers|website=www.spe.org|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; SPE salary survey report and data files are available for purchase through the SPE Bookstore.&lt;ref&gt;http://store.spe.org/Search.aspx?k=salary+survey&lt;/ref&gt;

===SPE Energy4me===
SPE's Energy4me program educates students aged 10 to 17 about the energy industry. Through fun and interactive hands-on activities that teach science, engineering and math concepts, Energy4me encourages young students to pursue engineering as a career field, ensuring the future workforce in the oil and natural gas industry. Energy4me conducts workshops for both teachers and students at many SPE conferences around the globe, and SPE members are encouraged to visit science classrooms at their local schools to conduct brief presentations. Energy4me educates thousands of children and teachers globally.&lt;ref&gt;http://energy4me.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solar System models''', especially mechanical models, called ''[[orreries]]'', that illustrate the relative positions and motions of the [[planet]]s and [[moon]]s in the [[Solar System]] have been built for centuries. While they often showed relative sizes, these models were usually not built to scale. The enormous ratio of interplanetary distances to planetary diameters makes constructing a [[scale model]] of the Solar System a challenging task. As one example of the difficulty, the distance between the [[Earth]] and the [[Sun]] is almost 12,000 times the diameter of the Earth.

If the smaller planets are to be easily visible to the naked eye, large outdoor spaces are generally necessary, as is some means for highlighting objects that might otherwise not be noticed from a distance. The objects in such models do not move. Traditional orreries often did move and some used clockworks to make the relative speeds of objects accurate. These can be thought of as being correctly scaled in time instead of distance.

==Scale models in various locations==
Many towns and institutions have built outdoor scale models of the Solar System. Here is a table comparing these models.

Several sets of [[geocaching]] [http://www.geocaching.com/seek/nearest.aspx?key=solar+system&amp;submit4=Go caches have been laid out as solar system models].

==A model based on a classroom globe==
Most classroom [[globe]]s are 41&amp;nbsp;cm (16 inches) in diameter. If the Earth were reduced to this size, the [[Moon]] would be a 10&amp;nbsp;cm (4&amp;nbsp;in) [[baseball]] floating 12 metres (40 feet) away. The Sun would be a [[beach ball]] 14 stories tall (somewhat smaller than the [[Spaceship Earth (Disney)|Spaceship Earth]] ride at [[Epcot]]) floating {{convert|5|km|mi}} away. While a complete model to this scale has never been built, a Solar System built centered in Washington DC, London, or Sydney, to that scale (approximately 1:31&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000) would look like this:

If the scale of the above model is increased to 1:310&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000, i.e. all distances and sizes reduced by a factor of 10, then the Earth and Venus can be modeled by [[ping pong ball]]s, the Moon and smaller planets by various size [[marbles]] or lumps of modeling clay, the gas giants by balloons or larger playing balls, and a circle the diameter of the Sun can be drawn on the floor of most classrooms. The scale distance to [[Alpha Centauri]] would be 1/3 of the way to the Moon.

Some planetaria and related museums often use this type of scale model of the Solar System, with a planetarium dome representing the Sun. Examples of this can be seen in planetaria like the [[Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum]], the [[Hayden Planetarium]] at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], the [[Clark Planetarium]], the [[Griffith Observatory]], the [[Louisiana Arts and Sciences Museum]], the [[Adventure Science Center]], etc.

'''William Tilden Blodgett''' (1823 – 4 November 1875) was a [[New York City]] art collector who was instrumental in founding the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

He was active in the [[American Civil War]] and organized the NYC [[Union League Club]] and the [[Sanitary Fair]] to raise funds for the wounded. He founded the newspaper ''[[The Nation]]'' and was a leader in establishing the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. He was a founding member of the committee to form the Met in 1869 and was its first chairman. He had been on the selection committee for the American works to be presented at the French exhibition of 1867 and thus felt he knew enough to purchase pictures for the young museum while abroad in 1870.

He purchased a total of 174 pictures which he financed together with [[John Taylor Johnston]] and about half of this "1871 purchase" is still in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/now-at-the-met/features/2011/today-in-met-history-march-28 Today in MET History]], museum blog in 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zenodotus''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ζηνόδοτος}}) was a [[Greek language|Greek]] grammarian, [[literary critic]], [[Homeric scholarship|Homeric scholar]], and the first [[librarian]] of the [[Library of Alexandria]].{{efn|name="Two Others}} A native of [[Ephesus]] and a pupil of [[Philitas of Cos]], he lived during the reigns of the first two [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]], and was at the height of his reputation about 280 BC.

==Biography==
Zenodotus was the first superintendent of the [[Library of Alexandria]] and the first critical editor ({{lang|grc|διορθωτής}} ''diorthōtes'') of [[Homer]]. His colleagues in the librarianship were [[Alexander Aetolus|Alexander of Aetolia]] and [[Lycophron of Chalcis]], to whom were allotted the tragic and comic writers respectively, Homer and other epic poets being assigned to Zenodotus.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=973}}

Although he has been reproached with arbitrariness and an insufficient knowledge of Greek, his recension undoubtedly laid a sound foundation for future criticism. Having collated the different manuscripts in the library, he expunged or obelized doubtful verses, transposed or altered lines, and introduced new readings. It is probable that he was responsible for the division of the Homeric poems into twenty-four books each (using capital Greek letters for the ''[[Iliad]]'', and lower-case for the ''[[Odyssey]]''){{dubious|date=March 2016}}, and possibly was the author of the calculation of the days of the ''Iliad'' in the ''[[Tabula Iliaca]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=973}}

He does not appear to have written any regular commentary on Homer, but his Homeric {{lang|grc|γλῶσσαι}} (''[[wikt:γλῶσσα|glōssai]]'', "lists of unusual words, [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]]") probably formed the source of the explanations of Homer attributed by the grammarians to Zenodotus. He also lectured upon [[Hesiod]], [[Anacreon (poet)|Anacreon]] and [[Pindar]], if he did not publish editions of them. He is further called an epic poet by the ''[[Suda]],'' and three epigrams in the ''[[Greek Anthology]]'' are assigned to him.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=973}}

In addition to his other scholarly work, Zenodotus introduced an organization system on the materials in the [[Library of Alexandria]] whereby texts were assigned to different rooms based on their subject matter. Within their subjects, Zenodotus organized the works [[Alphabetical order|alphabetically]] by the first letter of the name of their author. The principle of alphabetic organization was introduced by Zenodotus.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}  In addition, library staff attached a small tag to the end of each scroll which contained information on each work’s author, title, and subject so that materials could be easily returned to the area in which they had been classified, but also so that library users did not have to unroll each scroll in order to see what it contained. This was the first recorded use of [[metadata]], a landmark in library history.{{sfn|Phillips|2010}}

'''Zoophilia''' is a [[paraphilia]] involving a sexual fixation on non-human animals. '''Bestiality''' is [[Cross-species sex|cross-species sexual activity]] between [[human]] and non-human [[animals]]. The terms are often used interchangeably, but some researchers make a distinction between the attraction (zoophilia) and the act (bestiality).&lt;ref name="ranger"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Ranger |first1=R. |last2=Fedoroff |first2=P. | year = 2014 | title = Commentary: Zoophilia and the Law | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law Online | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 421–426 | url = http://www.jaapl.org/content/42/4/421.full | pmid = 25492067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although sex with animals [[Zoophilia and the law|is not outlawed in some countries]], in most countries, bestiality is illegal under [[cruelty to animals|animal abuse]] laws or laws dealing with [[buggery]] or [[crime against nature|crimes against nature]].

== Terminology ==
===General===
Three key terms commonly used in regards to the subject — ''zoophilia'', ''bestiality'', and ''zoosexuality'' — are often used somewhat interchangeably. Some researchers distinguish between zoophilia (as a persistent sexual interest in animals) and bestiality (as sexual acts with animals), because bestiality is often not driven by a sexual preference for animals.&lt;ref name="ranger" /&gt; Some studies have found that a preference for animals is rare among people who engage in sexual contact with animals.&lt;ref name="earls"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/107906320201400106 |pmid=11803597 |title=A Case Study of Preferential Bestiality (Zoophilia) |year=2002 |last1=Earls |first1=C.

===Zoophilia===
The term ''zoophilia'' was introduced into the field of research on sexuality in ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]'' (1886) by [[Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing|Krafft-Ebing]], who described a number of cases of "violation of animals (bestiality)",&lt;ref&gt;Richard von Krafft-Ebing: [[Psychopathia Sexualis]], p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "zoophilia erotica",&lt;ref&gt;Richard von Krafft-Ebing: [[Psychopathia Sexualis]], p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; which he defined as a sexual attraction to animal skin or fur. The term ''zoophilia'' derives from the combination of two nouns in [[Greek language|Greek]]: '''''ζῷον''''' (''zṓion'', meaning "animal") and '''''φιλία''''' (''[[wiktionary:-philia|philia]]'', meaning "(fraternal) love"). In general contemporary usage, the term ''zoophilia'' may refer to sexual activity between human and non-human animals, the desire to engage in such, or to the specific [[paraphilia]] (''i.e.,'' the atypical arousal) which indicates a definite preference for non-human animals over humans as sexual partners. Although Krafft-Ebing also coined the term ''zooerasty'' for the paraphilia of exclusive sexual attraction to animals,&lt;ref name="deviance 391"&gt;D. Richard Laws and William T. O'Donohue: [https://books.google.com/books?id=yIXG9FuqbaIC&amp;pg=PA391&amp;dq=zoophilia+paraphilia Books.Google.co.uk], Sexual Deviance, page 391. [[Guilford Press]], 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-59385-605-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that term has fallen out of general use.

===Zoosexuality===
[[File:Tako to ama retouched.jpg|thumb|right|[[Katsushika Hokusai|Hokusai]]&lt;!--Katsushika is the family name so it is put first, BUT he is called by his given name--&gt;'s (1760–1849) ''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife]]''.]]

The term ''zoosexual'' was proposed by [[Hani Miletski]] in 2002&lt;ref name="Handbookth"/&gt; as a value-neutral term. Usage of ''zoosexual'' as a noun (in reference to a person) is synonymous with zoophile, while the adjectival form of the word – as, for instance, in the phrase "zoosexual act" – may indicate sexual activity between a human and a non-human animal. The derivative noun "zoosexuality" is sometimes used by self-identified zoophiles in both support groups and on internet-based discussion forums to designate [[sexual orientation]] manifesting as romantic or emotional involvement with, or sexual attraction to, non-human animals.&lt;ref name="Handbookth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is zoosexuality|url=http://zoosexuality.org/?id=1|website=Zoosexuality.org|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bestiality===

The legal term ''bestiality'' has three common pronunciations: {{IPA|[ˌbestʃiˈæləti]}} or {{IPA|[ˌbistʃiˈæləti]}} in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pronunciation of bestiality|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/pronunciation/american/bestiality|publisher=MacMillan Dictionary|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{IPA|[ˌbestiˈæləti]}} in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pronunciation of bestiality|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/pronunciation/british/bestiality|publisher=MacMillan Dictionary|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some zoophiles and researchers draw a distinction between ''zoophilia'' and ''bestiality'', using the former to describe the desire to form sexual relationships with animals, and the latter to describe the sex acts alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sexuality.about.com/od/glossary/g/zoophilia.htm |title=Sexuality.about.com |website=Sexuality.about.com |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confusing the matter yet further, writing in 1962, Masters used the term ''bestialist'' specifically in his discussion of zoosadism.

Stephanie LaFarge, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the New Jersey Medical School, and Director of Counseling at the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|ASPCA]], writes that two groups can be distinguished: bestialists, who rape or abuse animals, and zoophiles, who form an emotional and sexual attachment to animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All Opposed, Say Neigh |url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/1999-12-15/news/all-opposed-say-neigh/ |author=Melinda Roth |work=Riverfront Times |date=15 December 1991 |accessdate=24 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colin J. Williams]] and [[Martin Weinberg]] studied self-defined zoophiles via the internet and reported them as understanding the term ''zoophilia'' to involve concern for the animal's welfare, pleasure, and consent, as distinct from the self-labelled zoophiles' concept of "bestialists", whom the zoophiles in their study defined as focused on their own gratification. Williams and Weinberg also quoted a British newspaper saying that ''zoophilia'' is a term used by "apologists" for ''bestiality''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Williams CJ, Weinberg MS |title=Zoophilia in men: a study of sexual interest in animals |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=523–35 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14574096 |doi=10.1023/A:1026085410617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extent of occurrence==
The [[Kinsey report]]s rated the percentage of people who had sexual interaction with animals at some point in their lives as 8% for men and 3.6% for women, and claimed it was 40–50% in people living near farms,&lt;ref name="deviance 391" /&gt; but some later writers dispute the figures, because the study lacked a random sample in that it included a disproportionate number of prisoners, causing [[sampling bias]]. [[Martin Duberman]] has written that it is difficult to get a random sample in sexual research, and that even when [[Paul Gebhard]], Kinsey's research successor, removed prison samples from the figures, he found the figures were not significantly changed.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Duberman: [http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/publications/duberman.html KinseyInstitute.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111215816/http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/publications/duberman.html |date=11 January 2009 }}, Kinsey's Urethra ''The Nation,'' 3 November 1997, pp. 40–43. Review of ''Alfred C. Kinsey: A Public/Private Life.'' By James H. Jones.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1974, the farm population in the USA had declined by 80 percent compared with 1940, reducing the opportunity to live with animals; Hunt's 1974 study suggests that these demographic changes led to a significant change in reported occurrences of bestiality. The percentage of males who reported sexual interactions with animals in 1974 was 4.9% (1948: 8.3%), and in females in 1974 was 1.9% (1953: 3.6%). Miletski believes this is not due to a reduction in interest but merely a reduction in opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt 1974, cited and re-examined by Miletski (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nancy Friday]]'s 1973 book on [[female sexuality]], ''[[My Secret Garden]]'', comprised around 190 fantasies from different women; of these, 23 involve zoophilic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nancy Friday|title=My Secret Garden|publisher=Simon and Schuster|edition=Revised|year=1998|isbn=978-0-671-01987-7|pages=180–185|chapter=What do women fantasize about?

In one study, psychiatric patients were found to have a statistically significant higher prevalence rate (55 percent) of reported bestiality, both actual sexual contacts (45 percent) and sexual fantasy (30 percent) than the control groups of medical in-patients (10 percent) and psychiatric staff (15 percent).&lt;ref name="psych"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1778686 |year=1991 |last1=Alvarez |first1=WA |last2=Freinhar |first2=JP |title=A prevalence study of bestiality (zoophilia) in psychiatric in-patients, medical in-patients, and psychiatric staff |volume=38 |issue=1–4 |pages=45–7 |journal=International Journal of Psychosomatics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crépault and Couture (1980) reported that 5.3 percent of the men they surveyed had fantasized about sexual activity with an animal during heterosexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01542159 |title=Men's erotic fantasies |year=1980 |last1=Crépault |first1=Claude |last2=Couture |first2=Marcel |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=565–81 |pmid=7458662}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 study, 3% of women and 2.2% of men reported fantasies about having sex with an animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Joyal |first1=C.

Sexual arousal from watching animals mate is known as ''faunoiphilia''.&lt;ref&gt;Aggrawal, Anil.

CRC Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A frequent interest in and sexual excitement at watching animals [[mating|mate]] is cited as an indicator of latent zoophilia by Massen (1994). [[Sexual fantasy|Sexual fantasies]] about zoophilic acts can occur in people who do not have any wish to experience them in real life. Nancy Friday notes that zoophilia as a fantasy may provide an escape from cultural expectations, restrictions, and judgements in regard to sex. Masters (1962) says that some brothel madams used to stage exhibitions of animals mating, as they found it aroused potential clientele, and that this may have encouraged the clients to engage in bestiality.&lt;ref name="watching"&gt;R.E.L.

==Perspectives on zoophilia==
[[File:Franz von Bayros 020.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Art by [[Franz von Bayros]] depicting [[oral sex]] between an adolescent and a [[deer]]]]

=== Research perspectives ===
Zoophilia has been partly discussed by several sciences: [[Psychology]] (the study of the human [[mind]]), [[sexology]] (a relatively new discipline primarily studying [[human sexuality]]), [[ethology]] (the study of [[ethology|animal behavior]]), and [[anthrozoology]] (the study of human-animal interactions and bonds).

The nature of animal minds, animal [[mental process]]es and structures, and animal [[self-awareness]], [[perception]], [[emotion in animals]], and "map of the world", are studied within [[animal cognition]] and also explored within various specialized branches of [[neuroscience]] such as [[neuroethology]].

In the fifth edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-5), zoophilia is placed in the classification "other specified paraphilic disorder"&lt;ref name="DSM 5"&gt;{{cite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition | chapter = Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder, 302.89 (F65.89) | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | page = 705}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("[[paraphilia]]s not otherwise specified" in the DSM-III and IV&lt;ref name=DSM&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;). The [[World Health Organization]] takes the same position, listing a sexual preference for animals in its [[ICD]][[ICD-10|-10]] as "other disorder of sexual preference".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/ |title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10, F65.8 Other disorders of sexual preference |website=Who.int |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the DSM-5, it rises to the level of a diagnosable disorder only when accompanied by distress or interference with normal functioning.&lt;ref name="DSM 5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miletski | first1 = H | year = 2015| title = Zoophilia – Implications for Therapy | url = | journal = JSET | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 85–86 | doi=10.1080/01614576.2001.11074387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoophilia may also be covered to some degree by other fields such as ethics, philosophy, law, [[animal rights]] and [[animal welfare]]. It may also be touched upon by [[sociology]] which looks both at zoosadism in examining patterns and issues related to [[sexual abuse]] and at non-sexual zoophilia in examining the role of animals as emotional support and companionship in human lives, and may fall within the scope of [[psychiatry]] if it becomes necessary to consider its significance in a clinical context.
The Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine (Vol. 18, February 2011) states that sexual contact with animals is almost never a clinically significant problem by itself;&lt;ref name="scidirectpii"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2011.01.004 |title=A new classification of zoophilia |year=2011 |last1=Aggrawal |first1=Anil |journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=73–8 |pmid=21315301}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also states that there are several kinds of zoophiles:&lt;ref name="scidirectpii"/&gt;

{| valign="top"
|-
|&lt;ul&gt;&lt;ol start="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Human-animal role-players&lt;li&gt;Romantic zoophiles&lt;li&gt;Zoophilic fantasizers&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
|&lt;ul&gt;&lt;ol start="4"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tactile zoophiles&lt;li&gt;Fetishistic zoophiles&lt;li&gt;Sadistic bestials&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
|&lt;ul&gt;&lt;ol start="7"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Opportunistic zoophiles&lt;li&gt;Regular zoophiles&lt;li&gt;Exclusive zoophiles&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
|}

Additionally, zoophiles in categories 2, 3, and 8 (romantic zoophiles, zoophilic fantasizers, and regular zoophiles) are the most common, while zoophiles found in categories 6 and 7 (sadistic bestials and opportunistic zoophiles) are the least common.&lt;ref name="scidirectpii"/&gt;

Zoophilia may reflect childhood experimentation, sexual abuse or lack of other avenues of sexual expression. Exclusive desire for animals rather than humans is considered a rare paraphilia, and sufferers often have other paraphilias&lt;ref name="LawsO'Donohue2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D.

The first detailed studies of zoophilia date from prior to 1910. Peer reviewed research into zoophilia in its own right started around 1960. However, a number of the most oft-quoted studies, such as Miletski, were not published in [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] journals. There have been several significant modern books, from Masters (1962) to Beetz (2002);&lt;ref name="Beetz2002"&gt;Beetz 2002, section 5.2.4 – 5.2.7.&lt;/ref&gt; their research arrived at the following conclusions:

:*Most zoophiles have (or have also had) long term human relationships as well or at the same time as zoosexual ones, and that zoosexual partners are usually dogs and/or horses (Masters, Miletski, Beetz)&lt;ref name="Beetz2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aggrawal2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anil Aggrawal|title=Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uNkNhPZQprcC&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=zoophilia+most+common+animal#PPA258|accessdate=13 May 2012|date=December 22, 2008|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-4309-9|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Zoophiles' emotions and care for animals can be real, relational, authentic and (within animals' abilities) reciprocal, and not just a substitute or means of expression.&lt;ref&gt;(Masters, Miletski, Weinberg, Beetz)&lt;/ref&gt; Beetz believes zoophilia is not an inclination which is chosen.&lt;ref name="Beetz2002"/&gt;
:* Society in general at present is considerably misinformed about zoophilia, its stereotypes, and its meaning.&lt;ref name="Beetz2002"/&gt; The distinction between zoophilia and zoosadism is a critical one to these researchers, and is highlighted by each of these studies. Masters (1962), Miletski (1999) and Weinberg (2003) each comment significantly on the social harm caused by misunderstandings regarding zoophilia: "This destroy[s] the lives of many citizens".&lt;ref name="Beetz2002"/&gt;

Beetz also states the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The phenomenon of sexual contact with animals is starting to lose its taboo: it is appearing more often in scholarly publications, and the public are being confronted with it, too.[...] Sexual contact with animals – in the form of bestiality or zoophilia – needs to be discussed more openly and investigated in more detail by scholars working in disciplines such as animal ethics, animal behavior, anthrozoology, psychology, mental health, sociology, and the law."&lt;ref name="BeetzPodberseck"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony L. Podberscek|author2=Andrea M. Beetz|title=Bestiality and Zoophilia: Sexual Relations with Animals|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z-GbOvrbniQC&amp;lpg=PT91&amp;dq=beetz%202002%20zoophilia&amp;pg=PT94#v=onepage&amp;q=beetz%202002%20zoophilia&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 May 2012|date=September 1, 2005|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-0-85785-222-9|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More recently, research has engaged three further directions – the speculation that at least some animals seem to enjoy a zoophilic relationship assuming [[Sadism and Masochism|sadism]] is not present, and can form an affectionate bond.&lt;ref&gt;Masters, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar findings are also reported by Kinsey (cited by Masters), and others earlier in history. Miletski (1999) notes that information on sex with animals on the internet is often very emphatic as to what the zoophile believes gives pleasure and how to identify what is perceived as [[consent]] beforehand. For instance, Jonathan Balcombe says animals do things for pleasure. But he himself says pet owners will be unimpressed by this statement, as this is not news to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jonathan Balcombe |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/may/29/animalbehaviour.evolution |title=Animals can be happy too |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=13 May 2012 |location=London |date=29 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beetz described the phenomenon of zoophilia/bestiality as being somewhere between crime, paraphilia and love, although she says that most research has been based on [[criminology|criminological]] reports, so the cases have frequently involved violence and psychiatric illness.

Several cultures built temples ([[Khajuraho]], India) or other structures ([[Sagaholm]], [[tumulus|barrow]], Sweden) with zoophilic carvings on the exterior, however at [[Khajuraho]] these depictions are not on the interior, perhaps depicting that these are things that belong to the profane world rather than the spiritual world, and thus are to be left outside.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In the Church-oriented culture of the [[Middle Ages]] zoophilic activity was met with execution, typically burning, and death to the animals involved either the same way or by hanging, as "both a violation of [[Religion and sexuality|Biblical edicts]] and a degradation of man as a spiritual being rather than one that is purely animal and carnal."&lt;ref&gt;Masters (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; Some witches were accused of having congress with the devil in the form of an animal. As with all accusations and confessions extracted under torture in the [[witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], their validity cannot be ascertained.&lt;ref name="BulloughBullough1994"/&gt;

===Religious perspectives===
Passages in [[Leviticus 18]] (Lev 18:23: "And you shall not lie with any beast and defile yourself with it, neither shall any woman give herself to a beast to lie with it: it is a perversion." RSV) and 20:15–16 ("If a man lies with a beast, he shall be put to death; and you shall kill the beast. If a woman approaches any beast and lies with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon them." RSV) are cited by Jewish, Christian, and Muslim theologians as categorical denunciation of bestiality. However, the teachings of the [[New Testament]] have been interpreted by some as not expressly forbidding bestiality.&lt;ref name="Plummer"&gt;{{cite conference |last=Plummer |first=Keith |title=To beast or not to beast: does the law of Christ forbid zoophilia? |year=2001 |url=http://place.asburyseminary.edu/trenpapers/892 |conference=53rd National Conference of the Evangelical Theological Society |location=Colorado Springs, CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Part II of his [[Summa Theologica]], medieval philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]] ranked various "unnatural vices" (sex acts resulting in "venereal pleasure" rather than procreation) by degrees of sinfulness, concluding that "the most grievous is the sin of bestiality."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/aquinas-homo.html Fordham.edu] Aquinas on Unnatural Sex&lt;/ref&gt; Some Christian theologians extend [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]'s view that [[Antithesis of the Law#Adultery|even having thoughts of adultery is sinful]] to imply that thoughts of committing bestial acts are likewise sinful.

There are a few references in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] scriptures to religious figures engaging in symbolic sexual activity with animals such as explicit depictions of people having sex with animals included amongst the thousands of sculptures of "Life events" on the exterior of the [[Hindu temple|temple complex]] at [[Khajuraho]]. The depictions are largely symbolic depictions of the sexualization of some animals and are not meant to be taken literally.&lt;ref&gt;The Critical and Cultural Study of the Shatapatha Brahmana by Swami Satya Prakash Saraswati, p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Hindu tradition of erotic painting and sculpture, having sex with an animal is believed to be actually a human having sex with a God incarnated in the form of an animal.&lt;ref name="PodberscekBeetz2005"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Anthony L. |last1=Podberscek |first2=Andrea M. |last2=Beetz |title=Bestiality and Zoophilia: Sexual Relations with Animals |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-GbOvrbniQC&amp;pg=PT12 |accessdate=4 January 2013 |date=1 September 2005 |publisher=Berg |isbn=978-0-85785-222-9 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some Hindu scriptures, such as the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' and the ''[[Devi Bhagavata Purana]]'', having sex with animals, especially the cow, leads one to [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Hell]], where one is tormented by having one's body rubbed on trees with razor-sharp thorns.&lt;ref name = "mani"&gt;{{cite book|author = Mani, Vettam|title = Puranic Encyclopaedia: A Comprehensive Dictionary With Special Reference to the Epic and Puranic Literature|publisher = Motilal Banarsidass|year = 1975|location = Delhi|isbn = 978-0-8426-0822-0|oclc=2198347|pages = 368–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many jurisdictions, all forms of zoophilic acts are prohibited; others outlaw only the mistreatment of animals, without specific mention of sexual activity. In the United Kingdom, [[Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]] (also known as the Extreme Pornography Act) outlaws images of a person performing or appearing to perform an act of intercourse or oral sex with an animal (whether dead or alive).&lt;ref name=opsisect63&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/4/section/63|work=Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008|title=Section 63 – Possession of extreme pornographic images|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the [[United Kingdom Ministry of Justice|UK Ministry of Justice]]'s explanatory note on extreme images saying "It is not a question of the intentions of those who produced the image.

The only EU countries where zoophilia remains legal are Finland, Hungary, and Romania.&lt;ref name="BBC Newsbeat 2015-04-22"&gt;{{cite web |title=Denmark passes law to ban bestiality |website=BBC Newsbeat |date=2015-04-22 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/32411241/denmark-passes-law-to-ban-bestiality |access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws on zoophilia are sometimes triggered by specific incidents.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Fischer: [https://web.archive.org/web/20080515222156/http://www.azstarnet.com/allheadlines/122006 Lawmakers hope to outlaw bestiality], 
''Arizona Daily Star,'' 28 March 2006. In Arizona, the motive for legislation was a "spate of recent cases."&lt;/ref&gt; While some laws are very specific, others employ vague terms such as "[[sodomy]]" or "bestiality", which lack legal precision and leave it unclear exactly which acts are covered. In the past, some bestiality laws may have been made in the belief that sex with an animal could result in monstrous offspring, as well as offending the community. Current anti-cruelty laws focus more specifically on animal welfare while anti-bestiality laws are aimed only at offenses to community "standards".&lt;ref name="posner"&gt;Posner, Richard, A Guide to America's Sex Laws, The [[University of Chicago Press]], 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-226-67564-0}}. Page 207.&lt;/ref&gt;
Notable legal views include Sweden, where a 2005 report by the Swedish Animal Welfare Agency for the government expressed concern over the increase in reports of [[horse-ripping]] incidents. The agency believed current animal cruelty legislation was not sufficient in protecting animals from abuse and needed updating, but concluded that on balance it was not appropriate to call for a ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=1357 |title=TheLocal.se |publisher=TheLocal.se |date=26 January 2012 |accessdate=13 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515124451/http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=1357 |archivedate=15 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Zealand]], the 1989 Crimes Bill considered abolishing bestiality as a criminal offense, and instead viewing it as a mental health issue, but they did not, and people can still be prosecuted for it. Under Section 143 of the Crimes Act 1961, individuals can serve a sentence of seven years duration for animal sexual abuse and the offence is considered 'complete' in the event of 'penetration'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM329260.html |title=Crimes Act 1961 No 43 (as at 01 October 2012), Public Act – New Zealand Legislation |publisher=Legislation.govt.nz |date=2012-10-01 |accessdate=2013-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canada]] a clarification of the anti-bestiality law was made in 2016 which legalizes most forms of sexual contact with animals other than penetration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scc-csc.ca/case-dossier/info/sum-som-eng.aspx?cas=36450|title=Her Majesty the Queen v.

Pornography involving sex with animals is widely illegal, even in most countries where bestiality itself is not explicitly outlawed.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In the [[United States]], zoophilic pornography would be considered [[obscene]] if it did not meet the standards of the [[Miller Test]] and therefore is not openly sold, mailed, distributed or imported across state boundaries or within states which prohibit it. Under U.S. law, 'distribution' includes transmission across the Internet. Production and mere possession appears to be legal, however. U.S. prohibitions on distribution of sexual or obscene materials are {{As of|2005|lc=on}} in some doubt, having been ruled [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] in ''[[United States v. Extreme Associates]]'' (a judgement which was overturned on appeal, December 2005).

Similar restrictions apply in Germany (see [[Zoophilia#Legal status|above]]). In [[New Zealand]] the possession, making or distribution of material promoting bestiality is illegal.

The potential use of media for [[pornographic movie]]s was seen from the start of the era of [[silent film]]. ''Polissons and Galipettes'' (re-released 2002 as "[[The Good Old Naughty Days]]") is a collection of early French silent films for brothel use, including some animal pornography, dating from around 1905 – 1930.

Material featuring sex with animals is widely available on the Internet, due to its ease of production.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Prior to the advent of mass-market magazines such as [[Playboy]], so-called [[Tijuana Bible]]s were a form of pornographic tract popular in America, sold as anonymous underground publications typically comprising a small number of stapled comic-strips representing characters and celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;An example digitized Tijuana Bible entitled ''The Pet'' from the 1960s is linked at [http://tijuanabibles.org/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi?action=detail&amp;item=TB073&amp;fullsize=0 tijuanabibles.org page link] (also see [http://tijuanabibles.org/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi/hzpi/u/HzSt031FT7pj.ctu7.2/hazel.cgi?action=detail&amp;item=TB073&amp;fullsize=1 full size] and [http://tijuanabibles.org/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi?action=SEARCH&amp;SEARCH_SPEC=bestiality&amp;SUBMIT_ACTION_SEARCH=Search search]).&lt;/ref&gt;
The promotion of "stars" began with the Danish [[Bodil Joensen]], in the period of 1969–72, along with other porn actors such as the Americans [[Linda Lovelace]] (''Dogarama'', 1969), Chessie Moore (multiple films, c. 1994), Kerri Downs (three films, 1998) and Calina Lynx (aka Kelly G'raffe) (two films, 1998). Another early film to attain great infamy was "[[Animal Farm (video)|Animal Farm]]", smuggled into Great Britain around 1980 without details as to makers or provenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dark Side of Porn Season 2 (2006) - Documentary / TV-Show|url=http://crimedocumentary.com/dark-side-porn-season-2-2006/|website=Crimedocumentary.com|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was later traced to a crude juxtaposition of smuggled cuts from many of Bodil Joensen's 1970s Danish movies.

Into the 1980s the Dutch took the lead, creating figures like "Wilma" and the "Dutch Sisters". In the 1980s, "bestiality" was featured in Italian adult films with actresses like Denise Dior, Francesca Ray, and [[Marina Hedman]], manifested early in the softcore flick ''Bestialità'' in 1976.

Today, in [[Hungary]], where production faces no legal limitations, zoophilic materials have become a substantial industry that produces numerous films and magazines, particularly for Dutch companies such as ''Topscore'' and ''Book &amp; Film International'', and the [[genre]] has stars such as "Hector", a [[Great Dane]] starring in several films. Many Hungarian mainstream performers also appeared anonymously in animal pornography in their early careers. For example, Suzy Spark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurobabeindex.com/sbandoindex/suzyspark.html EuroBabeIndex.com], Suzy Spark&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, animal pornography is used to bypass censorship laws, often featuring Japanese and Swedish{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} female models performing [[fellatio]] on animals, because oral penetration of a non-human penis is not in the scope of Japanese mosaic censor. Sakura Sakurada is an [[AV idol]] known to have appeared in animal pornography, specifically in the AV ''The Dog Game'' in 2006. While primarily underground, there are a number of animal pornography actresses who specialize in bestiality movies. A box-office success of the 1980s, ''[[24 Horas de Sexo Explícito]]'' featured zoophilia.

In the UK [[Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]] criminalises possession of realistic pornographic images depicting sex with animals (see [[extreme pornography]]), including fake images and simulated acts, as well as images depicting sex with dead animals, where no crime has taken place in the production. The law provides for sentences of up to two years in prison; a sentence of 12 months was handed down in one case in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/s/2086306_acts_of_depravity_found_on_dads_computer ‘Acts of depravity’ found on dad’s computer], ''[[Reading Post]]'', 26 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pornography of this sort has become the business of certain [[spam (electronic)|spammers]] such as [[Jeremy Jaynes]] and owners of some fake [[Thumbnail gallery post|TGP]]s, who use the promise of "extreme" material as a bid for users' attention.

==Health and safety==
{{Main article|Zoonosis}}
Infections that are transmitted from animals to humans are called [[Zoonosis|zoonoses]]. Some zoonoses may be transferred through casual contact, but others are much more readily transferred by activities that expose humans to the [[semen]], vaginal fluids, [[urine]], [[saliva]], [[feces]] and blood of animals. Examples of zoonoses are [[Brucellosis]], [[Q fever]], [[leptospirosis]], and [[toxocariasis]]. Therefore, sexual activity with animals is, in some instances, a high risk activity. [[Allergy|Allergic reactions]] to animal semen may occur, including [[anaphylaxis]]. Bites and other trauma from penetration or trampling may occur.

==Zoophiles==

=== Non-sexual zoophilia ===
The love of animals is not necessarily sexual in nature. In [[psychology]] and [[sociology]] the word "zoophilia" is sometimes used without sexual implications. Being fond of animals in general, or as pets, is accepted in Western society, and is usually respected or tolerated. However, the word zoophilia is used to mean a sexual preference towards animals, which makes it &lt;ref name="CraigheadNemeroff2002"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=W. Edward Craighead|editor2=Charles B. Nemeroff|title=The Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JQMRmyOfpJ8C&amp;dq=zoophilia+meaning&amp;q=zoophilia+meaning#v=snippet&amp;q=zoophilia%20meaning&amp;f=false|date=November 11, 2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-27083-6|page=1050}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[paraphilia]]. Some zoophiles may not act on their sexual attraction to animals. People who identify as zoophiles may feel their love for animals is romantic rather than purely sexual, and say this makes them different from those committing entirely sexually motivated acts of bestiality.&lt;ref name="Delaney2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Delaney|title=Law and Nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjqWw-9ZQfYC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=zoophilia+romantic|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43700-4|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoophile community===
[[File:Zeta toy MMB 01.jpg|thumb|right|Several companies (e.g., Bad Dragon) sell [[dildo]]s in the shape of animal penises, both realistic and fantastical. This one is based on a [[wolf's penis]].]]
An online survey which recruited participants over the internet concluded that prior to the arrival of widespread [[computer network]]ing, most zoophiles would not have known other zoophiles, and for the most part, zoophiles engaged in bestiality secretly, or told only trusted friends, family or partners. The internet and its predecessors made people able to search for information on topics which were not otherwise easily accessible and to communicate with relative safety and anonymity. Because of the diary-like intimacy of blogs and the anonymity of the internet, zoophiles had the ideal opportunity to "openly" express their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Montclair, 1997, cited by Miletski, 1999, p .35.&lt;/ref&gt; As with many other [[alternative lifestyle|alternate lifestyles]], broader networks began forming in the 1980s when participating in [[online community|networked social groups]] became more common at home and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Weinberg and Williams"&gt;Weinberg and Williams&lt;/ref&gt; Such developments in general were described by Markoff in 1990; the linking of computers meant that people thousands of miles apart could feel the intimacy akin to being in a small village together.&lt;ref&gt;Markoff, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The popular newsgroup [[alt.sex|alt.sex.bestiality]], said to be in the top 1% of newsgroup interest (i.e. number 50 out of around 5000), – and reputedly started in humor&lt;ref&gt;Miletski p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; – along with personal [[bulletin board]]s and [[talker]]s, chief among them [[Sleepy's multiple worlds]], [[Lintilla (talker)|Lintilla]], and Planes of Existence, were among the first group media of this kind&lt;!-- Clarify: Of what kind? Of all internet groups? Or of zoophilia-related internet groups? --&gt; in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These groups rapidly drew together zoophiles, some of whom also created personal and social websites and [[Internet Forum|internet forums]]. By around 1992–1994, the wide social net had evolved.&lt;ref&gt;Miletski (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; This was initially centered around the above-mentioned [[newsgroup]], alt.sex.bestiality, which during the six years following 1990 had matured into a discussion and support group.&lt;ref&gt;Milteski (1999), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andriette, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montclair, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The newsgroup included information about health issues, laws governing zoophilia, bibliography relating to the subject, and community events.&lt;ref&gt;Donofrio, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, other zoophile websites have been created and have grown in size; for example, the zoophile website and internet forum "beastforum.com" has more than one million members as of March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.big-boards.com/board/1626/ |title=Beast Forum statistics |publisher=Big-boards.com |accessdate=14 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106122801/http://www.big-boards.com/board/1626/ |archivedate=6 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beastforum.com |title=The Worlds Largest Bestiality Board |publisher=BeastForum.com |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weinberg and Williams observe that the internet can socially integrate an incredibly large number of people. In Kinsey’s day contacts between animal lovers were more localized and limited to male compatriots in a particular rural community. Further, while the farm boys Kinsey researched might have been part of a rural culture in which sex with animals was a part, the sex itself did not define the community. The zoophile community is not known to be particularly large compared to other subcultures which make use of the internet, so Weinberg and Williams surmised its aims and beliefs would likely change little as it grew. Those particularly active on the internet may not be aware of a wider subculture, as there is not much of a wider subculture{{clarify|date=December 2011}}, Weinberg and Williams felt the virtual zoophile group would lead the development of the subculture.&lt;ref name="Weinberg and Williams"/&gt;

There also exist websites which aim to provide support and social assistance to zoophiles (including resources to help and rescue abused or mistreated animals), but these are not usually well publicized. Such work is often undertaken as needed by individuals and friends, within social networks, and by word of mouth. One notable early attempt at creating a zoophile support structure focused on social and psychological support was the newsgroup soc.support.zoophilia, which was proposed in 1994 but narrowly failed to meet the 2/3 majority needed to be created{{clarify|date=December 2011}}. There was also a German support group called "Interessengemeinschaft Zoophiler Menschen ("Zoophile Interest Group").&lt;ref&gt;Miletski (1999), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoophiles tend to experience their first zoosexual feelings during adolescence, and tend to be secretive about it, hence limiting the ability for non-Internet communities to form:&lt;ref name="browplm2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas Francis |url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2009-08-20/news/those-who-practice-bestiality-say-they-re-part-of-the-next-gay-rights-movement/2/ |title=Those Who Practice Bestiality Say They're Part of the Next Sexual Rights Movement – Page 2 – News – Broward/Palm Beach – New Times Broward-Palm Beach |publisher=Broward/Palm Beach |date=20 August 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I asked him [a zoophile] when he had his first inkling of being a zoophile. 'When you're a kid, you're not really aware of too much sexually,' he says. 'But I was always interested in animals, starting around age 10. It was an extension of my affection for the dog and of my discovery of sex. He's a male. I'm a male. I wanted to make him feel good.' His attraction to dogs became stronger in his teens and stronger yet in his 20s. 'For years, I thought I was the only one who did this,' James says. 'I felt like there was no one I could talk to about this. I definitely knew I wasn't going to be talking to my parents or my friends about this.'[...] 'This is not a fetish,' James says of his attractions. 'It's an orientation, a lifestyle.'"&lt;ref name="browplm2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Leda - after Michelangelo Buonarroti.jpg|thumb|[[Leda and the Swan (Michelangelo)|''Leda and the Swan'']], copy of a lost Michelangelo.]]

Because of its controversial nature, people have developed arguments both for&lt;ref name="singer01"&gt;{{cite web|author=Pablo Stafforini |url=http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/2001----.htm |title=Heavy Petting, by Peter Singer |publisher=Utilitarian.net |accessdate=13 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606173906/http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/2001----.htm |archivedate=6 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and against&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stopbestiality.wordpress.com/2010/12/12/bestiality-and-lack-of-consent/ |title=Bestiality and Lack of Consent " StopBestiality |publisher=Stopbestiality.wordpress.com |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; zoophilia. Arguments for and against zoosexual activity from a variety of sources, including religious, moral, ethical, psychological, medical and social.

=== Arguments against bestiality ===
Bestiality is seen by the government of the United Kingdom as profoundly disturbed behavior (as indicated by the UK [[Home Office]] review on sexual offences in 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm56/5668/5668.pdf |title=Protecting the Public: Strengthening Protection Against Sex Offenders and Reforming the Laws on Sexual Offences |chapter=Other offences |pages=32–3 |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-10-156682-7 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20131205100653/http://www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm56/5668/5668.pdf |archivedate=5 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrea Beetz states there is evidence that there can be violent zoosadistic approaches to sex with animals. Beetz argues that animals might be traumatized even by a non-violent, sexual approach from a human;&lt;ref name="Beetz 2002, section 5.2.8"&gt;Beetz 2002, section 5.2.8.&lt;/ref&gt; however, Beetz also says that in some cases, non-abusive bestiality can be reciprocally pleasurable for both the human and non-human animal.&lt;ref name="Beetz 2002, section 5.2.8"/&gt;

An argument from human dignity is given by Wesley J. Smith, a senior fellow and [[Intelligent Design]] proponent at the [[Center for Science and Culture]] of the conservative Christian [[Discovery Institute]]: – "such behavior is profoundly degrading and utterly subversive to the crucial understanding that human beings are unique, special, and of the highest moral worth in the known universe—a concept known as '[[human exceptionalism]]' ... one of the reasons bestiality is condemned through law is that such degrading conduct unacceptably subverts standards of basic human dignity and is an affront to humankind's inestimable importance and intrinsic moral worth."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wesleyjsmith.com/blog/2005/08/bestiality-and-varied-attacks-on-human.html Wesleyjsmith.com] and [http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/985pgwjh.asp Weeklystandard.com], 31 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the primary critiques of bestiality is that it is harmful to animals and necessarily abusive, because animals are unable to give or withhold consent.&lt;ref name=Regan63&gt;Regan, Tom. ''Animal Rights, Human Wrongs''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003, pp. 63–4, 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) has said that as animals do not have the same capacity for thinking as humans, they are unable to give full consent. The HSUS takes the position that all sexual activity between humans and animals is abusive, whether it involves physical injury or not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmanimalcontrol.com/aco_fo/sex_abuse/ Sex Abuse] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20071214033934/http://www.nmanimalcontrol.com/aco_fo/sex_abuse/ |date=14 December 2007 }}, NManimalControl.com&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1993 article, Dr. Frank Ascione stated that "bestiality may be considered abusive even in cases when physical harm to an animal does not occur." In a 1997 article, Piers Beirne, Professor of Criminology at the University of Southern Maine, points out that 'for genuine consent to sexual relations to be present...both participants must be conscious, fully informed and positive in their desires.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmanimalcontrol.com/aco_fo/sex_abuse/ |title=The First Strike Campaign: ANIMAL SEXUAL ABUSE FACT SHEET |website=NManimalControl.com |accessdate=13 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312010653/http://www.nmanimalcontrol.com/aco_fo/sex_abuse/ |archive-date=2007-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2752/089279393787002105 |title=Children Who are Cruel to Animals: A Review of Research and Implications for Developmental Psychopathology |year=1993 |last1=Ascione |first1=Frank R. |journal=Anthrozoös: A Multidisciplinary Journal of the Interactions of People and Animals |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=226–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arguments for bestiality ===
[[File:Persian woman with an animal Wellcome L0033282.jpg|thumb|Book illustration depicting dog with woman, [[Isfahan]], [[Iran]], 15th century.]]
Some defenders of bestiality argue that the issue of [[sexual consent]] is irrelevant because many legal human practices (such as [[semen collection]], [[Artificial insemination of livestock and pets|artificial insemination]], hunting, [[animal testing|laboratory testing]], and slaughtering animals for meat) do not involve the consent of the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=28 February 2011 by Lucas Wachob |url=http://www.breezejmu.org/opinion/columnists/article_f08fbb0c-42ca-11e0-ab43-00127992bc8b.html |title=Column: In defense of chicken 'lovers' – The Breeze: Columnists |website=Breezejmu.org |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Cutteridge states the following regarding this argument:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Animal sexual autonomy is regularly violated for human financial gain through procedures such as [artificial insemination and slaughter]. Such procedures are probably more disturbing physically and psychologically than acts of zoophilia would be, yet the issue of consent on the part of the animal is never raised in the discussion of such procedures. To confine the 'right' of any animal strictly to acts of zoophilia is thus to make a law [against zoophilia] based not on reason but on moral prejudice, and to breach the constitutional rights of zoophiles to due process and equality before the law. [...] Laws which criminalize zoophilia based on societal abhorrence of such acts rather than any real harm caused by such acts are an unjust and unconstitutional infringement on individual liberty."&lt;ref name="interdis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/cutteridgepaper.pdf |title=Inter-disciplinary.net |format=PDF |accessdate=13 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722100122/http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/cutteridgepaper.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Hani Miletski|Miletski]] believes that "Animals are capable of sexual consent – and even initiation – in their own way."&lt;ref&gt;Miltski, 1999, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not an uncommon practice for dogs to attempt to copulate with ("hump") the legs of people of both genders.&lt;ref&gt;Cauldwell, 1948 &amp; 1968; Queen, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenberger (1968) emphasizes that as far as cunnilingus is concerned, dogs require no training, and even Dekkers (1994) and Menninger (1951) admit that sometimes animals take the initiative and do so impulsively.&lt;ref name="Beetz 2002, section 5.2.8"/&gt; Those supporting zoophilic activity feel animals sometimes even seem to enjoy the sexual attention&lt;ref&gt;Blake, 1971, and Greenwood, 1963, both cited in Miletski, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; or voluntarily initiate sexual activity with humans.&lt;ref name="Dekkers, 1994"&gt;Dekkers, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Animals such as dogs can be willing participants in sexual activity with humans, and "seem to enjoy the attention provided by the sexual interaction with a human."&lt;ref name="interdis"/&gt; Animal owners normally know what their own pets like or do not like. Most people can tell if an animal does not like how it is being petted, because it will move away. An animal that is liking being petted pushes against the hand, and seems to enjoy it.

Singer and others have argued that people's dislike of bestiality is partly caused by irrational [[speciesism]] and [[anthropocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/isle/isq034 |title=Animal Liberation or Human Redemption: Racism and Speciesism in Toni Morrison's Beloved |year=2010 |last1=Ruetenik |first1=T. |journal=Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=317–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/cul.2010.0020 |first=Colleen Glenney |last=Boggs |date=Fall 2010 |title=American Bestiality: Sex, Animals, and the Construction of Subjectivity |journal=Cultural Critique |volume=76 |issue=76|pages=98–125 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/cultural_critique/summary/v076/76.boggs.html |jstor=40925347|doi-broken-date=2018-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because interspecies sex occurs in nature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/03/070314-hybrids.html |title=Interspecies Sex: Evolution's Hidden Secret? |website=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because humans ''are'' animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/pwruab/cgi-bin/pwrofthepen/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/kerstin-grune1.pdf|format=PDF|title=Changing Perspectives of Bestiality: Breaking the Human-Animal Distinction to Violating Animal  Rights|website=Stanford.edu|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporters argue that zoosexual activity is not "unnatural" and is not intrinsically wrong.&lt;ref name="mroberts"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1328310 |title=The Unjustified Prohibition against Bestiality: Why the Laws in Opposition Can Find No Support under the Harm Principle |year=2009 |last1=Roberts |first1=Michael |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/01639625.2010.538356 |title=Screwing the Pooch: Legitimizing Accounts in a Zoophilia On-line Community |year=2011 |last1=Maratea |first1=R.

Some zoophiles claim that they are not abusive towards animals:&lt;ref name="ScientificAmerican" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In other recent surveys, the majority of zoophiles scoffed at the notion that they were abusive toward animals in any way—far from it, they said. Many even consider themselves to be animal welfare advocates in addition to zoophiles."&lt;ref name="ScientificAmerican" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Mentions in the media==
Because of its controversial nature, different countries vary in the discussion of bestiality. Often sexual matters are the subject of legal or regulatory requirement. In 2005 the UK broadcasting regulator ([[OFCOM]]) updated its code stating that freedom of expression is at the heart of any democratic state. Adult audiences should be informed as to what they will be viewing or hearing, and the young, who cannot make a fully informed choice for themselves, should be protected. Hence a [[Watershed (television)|watershed]] and other precautions were set up for explicit sexual material, to protect young people. Zoophile activity and other sexual matters may be discussed, but only in an appropriate context and manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/codes/bcode/?a=87101 |title=OFCOM Broadcasting Code |website=Ofcom.org.uk |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPT was replaced after the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act in 1993, replaced with bodies designed to allow both more debate and increased consistency, and possession and supply of material that it is decided are objectionable was made a criminal offence.

Mention in the media is often comical in nature. References to bestiality are not uncommon in some media, especially adult [[cartoon]] series such as ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[South Park]]'', [[satire|satirical comedy]] such as ''[[Borat]]'', and films (especially shock [[exploitation film]]s), although a few broadcasters such as [[Howard Stern]] (who joked about bestiality dial-a-date on NBC) and [[Tom Binns]] (whose [[XFM London]] Breakfast Show resulted on one occasion in a live discussion about the ethics of zoophilic pornographic movies at peak child listening time) have been reprimanded by their stations for doing so.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In literature, American novelist [[Kurt Vonnegut]] refers to a photo of a woman attempting sexual intercourse with a Shetland Pony in ''[[The Sirens of Titan]]'', ''[[Slaughterhouse Five]]'', and ''[[God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater]]''. [[Philip K. Dick]] also refers to a photo of a woman copulating with a Shetland Pony in ''[[Flow My Tears The Policeman Said]]''. [[John Irving]]'s novel ''[[The Cider House Rules]]'' repeatedly mentions a pornographic photograph depicting oral sex on a pony. In ''[[Clerks II]]'' Randal orders a [[donkey show]] as a going away present for his best friend Dante, in which it is referred to as "interspecies erotica" by the male performer.

[[Pu Songling]] refers to zoophilia in the ''[[Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio]]'' short story "[[The Fornicating Dog]]", which talks about sexual relations between a woman and her white dog.
