      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3650">[[File:Hunter Museum Label.jpg|thumb|Every object in galleries has a label where you'll find that object's accession number. ]]
In [[library|libraries]], [[art gallery|art galleries]], [[museum]]s and [[archive]]s, an '''accession number''' is a unique identifier assigned to, and achieving initial control of, each acquisition. Assignment of accession numbers typically occurs at the point of accessioning or cataloging.  The term is something of a misnomer, because the form accession numbers take is often alpha-numeric.&lt;ref name="Witt"&gt;Witt, B.S., Whittfield, J.C., Stepansky, A.J. (2012) ''Pastperfect software for museum collections: Version 5 users guide.'' Retrieved from http://museumsoftware.com/v5userguide.html&lt;/ref&gt;

If an item is removed from the collection, its number is usually not reused for new items.

In libraries, this numbering system is usually in addition to the [[library classification]] number (or alphanumeric code) and to the [[ISBN]] or International Standard Book Number assigned by [[publisher]]s.

Accession numbers are also used in [[botany]], by institutions with living collections like [[arboretum|arboreta]], [[botanic garden]]s, etc., to identify plants or groups of plants that are of the same [[taxon]], are of the same [[Propagule|propagule type]] (or treatment), were received from the same source, were received at the same time.&lt;ref name="Glasnevin"&gt;Jebb, Matthew (1998) ''Cataloguing and Record keeping for Plant Collections'' Retrieved from http://www.botanicgardens.ie/educ/accnosho.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbarium|Herbaria]] and other botanic institutions collecting non living material also use accession numbers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

An accession number may include the year acquired, sometimes the full date (as at the [[British Museum]]), and a sequential number separated by a period.&lt;ref name="Witt" /&gt; In addition, departments or art classifications within the collection or museum may reserve sections of numbers. For example, objects identified by the numbers 11.000 through 11.999 may indicate objects obtained by the museum in 1911; the first 300 numbers might be used to indicate American art, while the next fifty (11.301–350) might be used for [[African art]]. In some cases, they also include letters and other punctuation, such as commas, hyphens or slashes.&lt;ref&gt;Reitz, J.M. (2004) ''Dictionary for library and information science.'' Libraries Unlimited. p.&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/ref&gt;

In older institutions, simpler numbering systems are sometimes maintained alongside, or incorporated within, newer systems.  Where the objects are unique, institutions normally need to retain the original number in some form as it will have been used in old references that are still of use in scholarship.  In particular, collections of [[manuscripts]] use the prefix "MS", and many well known manuscripts are known by their old MS numbers, often incorporating a prefix for a particular collection within a library.  These collections may be divided by former owners, as with several [[British Library]] [[:Category:British Library collections|"closed" collections]], or by language, as with [[Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF Fr 2643-6)|Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF MS Fr. 2643-6)]], indicating a two volume manuscript in French at the {{lang|fr|[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]}}.

'''Agricultural Education''' is the teaching of [[agriculture]], [[natural resource]]s, and [[land management]]. At higher levels, agricultural education is primarily undertaken to prepare students for employment in the [[Primary sector of the economy|agricultural sector]]. Classes taught in an agricultural education [[curriculum]] may include [[horticulture]], land management, turf grass management, [[agricultural science]], small animal care, machine and shop classes, health and nutrition, livestock management, and [[biology]].

Agricultural education is common at the [[Primary education|primary]], [[Secondary education|secondary]] (including middle and high school in the United States), [[Tertiary education|tertiary]] (including vocational schools and universities), and [[Adult education|adult]] levels.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last=Phipps |last2=Osborne |last3=Dyer |last4=Ball |first=Lloyd |first2=Edward |first3=James |first4=Ann |title=Handbook on Agricultural Education in Public Schools Sixth Edition|year=2008|publisher=Delmar Learning|location=NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elementary agriculture is often taught in both [[Public school (government funded)|public]] and [[private school]]s, and can cover such subjects as how [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s grow and how soil is farmed and conserved. Vocational agriculture trains people for jobs in such areas as production, [[marketing]], and conservation. College agriculture involves training of people to teach or conduct [[research]] in order to advance the fields of agriculture and [[food science]]. General education informs the public about food and agriculture.

Disciplines closely tied to agricultural education include agricultural communications, agricultural leadership, and extension education.

== In the United States ==
The chief sources of agriculture education in the United States are [[Secondary education in the United States|high schools]], [[Community colleges in the United States|community colleges]], four-year [[college]]s and [[University|universities]], youth organizations, and the 10x15 program.

===History===
The rapid growth of agricultural education began during the late 19th century. In 1862, the [[United States Congress]] created the Department of Agriculture to gather and distribute agricultural information. The [[Morrill Act]], which provided the land-grant schools, became law that same year. The [[Hatch Act of 1887|Hatch Act]] of 1887 gave federal funds to establish agricultural experiment stations.  The first dairy school in the U.S. was created at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisc.edu/dysci/images/DairyScienceHistoryPoster.pdf|title=A Century of Excellence in Education and Discovery|author=L.H. Schultz|author2=D.A.

Olson|author4=W.T. Howard|author5=D.P. Dickson|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 
Government support for agricultural education has increased during the 20th century. For example, the [[Smith-Lever Act]] of 1914 created what is now the Cooperative Extension System (1988). The [[Smith-Hughes Act]] of 1917 and the George-Barden Act of 1946 financed high-school instruction in farming. [[Woodlawn High School (Woodlawn, Virginia)]] was the first public high school in the United States to offer agricultural education classes under the Smith-Hughes Act.&lt;ref&gt;Worrell, A. (2009, January) Woodlawn School Tabbed for Historical Marker. ''The Carroll News''. Retrieved from http://www.thecarrollnews.com/view/full_story/5528284/article-Woodlawn-School-tabbed-for-historical-marker {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130031837/http://thecarrollnews.com/view/full_story/5528284/article-Woodlawn-School-tabbed-for-historical-marker |date=2010-11-30 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vocational Education Act of 1963 funded training in other fields of agriculture.
* 
Agricultural science and education expanded after 1900 in response to a need for more technical knowledge and skill in the use of newly-developed agricultural technologies. This development led to the use of modern farming methods that required fewer farmworkers, resulting in larger, corporatized farms and ranches. This development increased the need for more agriculture science and education.

Other legislation influenced the development of agricultural education into what the field is today. It has developed throughout the last century from various laws and pieces of legislation.

The Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 required all public schools to provide a free and appropriate education to all students with disabilities. Under this provision, children with disabilities were now allowed to enroll in agricultural classes. The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]], enacted in 1990, further required public schools to give students with disabilities equal opportunity for education to all other children in the country, and as a result, it increased opportunities for students with disabilities participate in agricultural classes.

Educate America Act of 1994 raised benchmark standards for public education at the districts level, increasing curriculum and development requirements for all classes, including agricultural ones. The School-to-Work Opportunities Act, also of 1994, required teachers to teach students tasks and disciplines that would help their students prepare for employment once they graduated, of which practical education in agriculture was a major part. Finally, [[No Child Left Behind]] (Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 2001) further raised standards for students in public schools and increased requirements of teachers in order to reach these standards, affecting agricultural education as part of the general curriculum of many schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Elementary school===
In 2006, [[Walton Rural Life Center]] in [[Walton, Kansas]] was the first public elementary school in the United States to base its curriculum around agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;U. S. Department of Education (2011-01-19). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQT2uwDXcF0 "Using Agriculture to Spur Achievement - The Walton 21st Century Rural Life Center."] Online video. ''Youtube.com''. Retrieved 2016-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===High schools===
Agricultural education at the high school level focuses on three main categories: classroom instruction, [[supervised agricultural experience]] (SAE), and active involvement in the [[National FFA Organization]] (Future Farmers of America).

Classroom instruction of an agricultural class teaches the students the basic concepts of the particular course through hands on learning and experience. Students will be taught the information in the curriculum in order for them to understand and develop skills in the application and problem solving issues that would occur in an agricultural setting.&lt;ref name="Agricultural Education Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Phipps |last2=Osborne |last3=Dyer |last4=Ball |first=Lloyd |first2=Edward |first3=James |first4=Ann |title=Handbook on Agricultural Education in the Public Schools Sixth Edition|year=2008|publisher=Delmar Learning|location=NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE) portion of the agricultural curriculum is when a student must use the knowledge they have gained in the classroom instruction and use it in real life situations. Several topic choices are available for the student to choose between, whether it is on a farm setting, exploratory setting, entrepreneurship, agribusiness, or research projects. The student will choose a task from one of these topic areas and conduct a research experiment throughout the course of the agricultural class. The teacher is involved in the process and will help guide the student along the way. SAE programs give students the opportunity to take the information learned in the classroom setting and use it on an agricultural topic that interests them. This portion of an agricultural education will give students an idea of how it is working out in the real world and solving problems that will arise in the work field.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

The FFA is a national organization that all agricultural classes at the high school level are involved in. The agricultural teacher is the leader of that particular schools FFA chapter, and will guide students’ activities and programs held throughout the year. FFA is an educational program designed to teach students leadership skills in both agricultural settings and everyday life, encourages personal growth in students, boosts self-confidence, builds character, encourage healthy lifestyles, and give students opportunities to be a part of the agricultural economy. FFA chapters will volunteer in communities, conduct banquets for FFA members and their families, raise awareness of agriculture, compete in FFA competitions, and attend national FFA conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National FFA Organization- Agricultural Education|url=https://www.ffa.org/Pages/default.aspx|accessdate=2013-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Young Farmers Association is a requirement that any agricultural teacher must meet. This is a group led by the agricultural teacher that meets usually monthly. The group will consist of all the local farmers, citizens, or anyone interested in learning more about agriculture and the new methods that are being created. The Young Farmers Association is designed so that the technologies made in the agricultural field will be introduced and used in the economy, and gives agricultural teachers the opportunity to meet local citizens and reach out in the community.&lt;ref name="Agricultural Education Handbook" /&gt;

===Colleges and universities===
[[Image:Gville UF Floyd03.jpg|thumb|upright|[[University of Florida College of Agricultural and Life Sciences|College of Agriculture at the University of Florida]]]]
[[Land-grant university|Land-grant universities]] awarded more than three-quarters of all agricultural degrees in 1988. These state schools receive federal aid under legislation that followed the [[Morrill Act]] of 1862, which granted public lands to support agricultural or mechanical education. Land-grant universities have three chief functions: teaching, research, and outreach, or extension.

==== Teaching ====
A [[bachelor's degree]] in agricultural education generally leads to employment teaching agriculture up to the high school level or in the agricultural sector. Students are required to complete agriculture classes as well as education classes in order to become qualified to teach. A [[master's degree]] is required in order to teach at the college level. The [[Association for Career and Technical Education]] (ACTE), the largest national education association dedicated to the advancement of education that prepares youth and adults for careers, provides [http://www.acteonline.org/members/techniques/articlesbyagri.cfm resources for agricultural education]. An agricultural education degree also gives the qualifications to do extension work for universities and agricultural companies and organizations.&lt;ref name="Phipps, Osborne, Dyer, Ball 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Phipps |last2=Osborne |last3=Dyer |last4=Ball |first=Lloyd |first2=Edward |first3=James |first4=Ann|title=Handbook on Agricultural Education in Public Schools|year=2008|publisher=Delmar Learning|location=NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following universities provide pathways to complete certification requirements of their home states in secondary agricultural education:
* Alcorn State University
*Angelo State University - Texas 
* Auburn University [http://www.education.auburn.edu/academic-program/agriscience-education/]

*Texas Tech University 
*Tarleton State University -Texas
* University of Arkansas
* [[University of Missouri]]
* Utah State University
* Washington State University
* West Virginia University
*West Texas A &amp; M - Texas

Colleges of agriculture additionally prepare students for careers in all aspects of the food and agricultural system. Some career choices include [[food science]], [[veterinary science]], [[farming]], [[ranching]], [[teaching]], [[marketing]], [[agricultural communication]], [[management]], and [[social services]]. Colleges and universities awarded about 21,000 bachelor's degrees in agriculture per year in 1988, and about 6,000 master's or doctor's degrees.

==== Research ====
Each land-grant university has an agricultural experiment station equipped with laboratories and experimental farms. There, agricultural scientists work to develop better farming methods, solve the special problems of local farmers, and provide new technology. Research published in [[Academic journal|scholarly journals]] about agricultural safety is available from the [[NIOSH]]-supported [[National Agricultural Safety Database]]. The [[American Dairy Science Association]] provides research and education scholarships focused on the [[dairy]] farm and processing industries.

====Extension service====

The [[Cooperative Extension System]] is a partnership of the federal, state, and county governments. This service distributes information gathered by the land-grant universities and the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] to farmers, families, and young people. County extension agents, located in most countries (1988), train and support about 3 million (1988) volunteer leaders. Agents and volunteers carry out extension programs through meetings, workshops, [[newsletter]]s, [[radio]], [[television]], and visits.

===Related Organizations===

Professional organizations in the United States related to agricultural education include the American Association for Agricultural Education (AAAE), the Association of Career and Technical Education (ACTE), the National Association of Agricultural Education (NAAE), and The Council for Agricultural Education.

4H Club is considered a youth development program that teaches children about sciences, leadership, research, etc. 4H club has over 6 million members nationwide and is the largest youth development organization in the United States. 4H members use hands on learning to reach goals and help in communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4H youth development organization|url=http://www.4-h.org/about/youth-development-organization/|accessdate=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of 4-H carry out group and individual projects dealing with [[conservation biology|conservation]], food and agriculture, [[health and safety]], and other subjects. The 4-H program in the United States is part of the Cooperative Extension service.

Somewhat similarly, the FFA is a national organization that teaches students leadership skills and is designed to help members become more well rounded citizens in the agricultural field.&lt;ref name="Phipps, Osborne, Dyer, Ball 2008" /&gt; The FFA is an integral part of the program of agricultural education in many high schools as a result of Public Law 740 in 1950 (Currently revised as Publication 105-225 of the 105th Congress of the United States), with 649,355 FFA members (2016-2017). Local chapters participate in Career Development Events (individually and as a team), each student has a Supervised Agricultural Experience program (SAE), and participates in many conferences and conventions to develop leadership, citizenship, patriotism and excellence in agriculture.  The National FFA Organization is structured from the local chapter up, including local districts, areas, regions, state associations, and the national level.  The FFA Mission is to make a positive difference in the lives of students by developing their potential for premier leadership, personal growth, and career success through agricultural education.

==Outside the US==
[[Image:Hurlstone dairy.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hurlstone Agricultural High School]] in Australia maintains a dairy with 42 head of cattle.]]
The history of agricultural education predates USA activities and derives from, the development of Scottish, Italian and German colleges. The land grant approach of the USA owes much to the Scottish system in particular. Changes in higher agricultural education around the world today are highlighting implicit approaches that have hampered development and exceptional advances that have fed the world. the process has been described in one text (below) which takes a global perspective.

Agricultural education in other countries resembles that in the United States. Canada has its own 4-H program. [[Agriculture Canada]] distributes information on new farming methods and maintains experimental farms, research stations, and research institutions throughout the country. [[BC Agriculture in the Classroom Foundation]] operates in the province of [[British Columbia]]. In Australia, each state has several agricultural research stations and an extension service. Great Britain has a program of youth clubs called [[Young Farmer's Clubs]] that resemble 4-H. South Africa has twenty-two institutions offering further education in agriculture, including Agricolleges, that offers [https://agricolleges.com/ online agricultural education].   The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations works to train people throughout the world in modern farming methods. The United States gives technical assistance to farmers in developing nations through its [[Agency for International Development]] (AID).

=== Australia ===
[[File:Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School.JPG|thumb|Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School]]
As of February 2015 [[Agriculture in Australia]] employs over 235,300 people in the agriculture, fishing and forestry and fishing industry. This industry alone equates to 12% share of the GDP earning close to  $155 billion a year. The farmers own a combined 135,997 farms covering approximately 61% of the land mass.

Given these figures the agricultural programs in place in school and universities in very important to the future of the county. Several high schools operate across the country specifying in agriculture education. Predominantly these high schools are set in the rural areas with access to land. On the majority of cases the students often travel 1000&amp;nbsp;km to attend schools, taking up residence at the schools as boarders for the school term. The one of the biggest in Australia is [[Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School]] in central New South Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
The Agriculture in Education programme launched by the Australian government in 2015 helps teachers better understand the products and processes associated with food and fibre production and gives students an opportunity to understand the importance of agriculture in the Australian economy. Topics covered by the materials include: designing and making a financial plan for a market garden, free range chicken farming, food security, and sustainable production practices in food and fibre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ministers.education.gov.au/pyne/new-resources-boost-student-learning-agriculture], The Hon Christopher Pyne MP &gt; New resources to boost student learning in agriculture

'''The Case for Growth and Quality in Agricultural Education'''

Of the critical issues facing the nation, few are more compelling than improving the academic performance of public schools and ensuring a stable, safe and affordable food supply.  Today agricultural education is positioned to contribute substantially in these arenas through a major national initiative.
Under the direction of The National Council for Agricultural Education, the "10x15 Long Range Goal for Agricultural Education" employs a comprehensive strategy engaging eight high-priority initiatives.  The focus of the unprecedented effort is twofold:  create new programs in communities not yet served by agricultural education and FFA, and ensure the quality and high performance of current programs providing personal, academic and career education in agriculture.  While the goal of "10x15" is to grow the number of agricultural education programs from 7,200 to 10,000 by the year 2015, the clear emphasis is on quality.

Several factors make this effort timely and essential.  First, the public's expectations for higher student achievement are leading to dramatic increases in accountability, standards, rigor and relevance throughout education.  Especially critical is the need to raise math and science proficiency.  Second, the industry of agriculture, already concerned about meeting growing domestic and global demands for food and fiber, is eager to identify the future managers, leaders and workers who will ensure the future security and productivity of agriculture.  A forecasted shortage of well-educated workers is adding urgency to the issue.  Also, concerns about food safety, security and independence are registering at the highest levels of agribusiness and government.  Lastly, local communities are intent on cultivating leadership and securing effective participation from their citizens. Through the intra-curricular programs of agricultural education and the FFA, a half-million students are developing skills in leadership, communication, team building and civic engagement. They will be prepared to provide for the social, economic and cultural well-being of small communities and large urban centers alike.

The work of "10x15" is concentrated in eight national task forces operating over the next several years.  Their scope of work includes national program and content standards; teacher recruitment and preparation; alternative program design; [[data reporting]]; public advocacy; brand communication strategy; and program funding.  Driving the work of "10x15" are more than a hundred top leaders drawn from today's Team Ag Ed, including teachers, students, university educators, state education leaders, the National FFA Organization, alumni, business and industry, and key stakeholders

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9056">The '''BMW Guggenheim Lab''' is a collaboration between the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation]] and the [[BMW]] Group.  It is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] mobile laboratory that visited three cities around the world between 2011 and 2013.  The lab is part urban [[think tank]], part [[community center]], and part gathering space, and explores issues of urban life through public programming and discourse.&lt;ref name="bmw"&gt;McHugh, Sharon. [http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=16691 "BMW Guggenheim Lab to Launch in NYC"], ''World Architecture News'', May 17, 2011, accessed January 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Three different structures were to house the lab over the life of the project, each of which would travel to three cities.  The lab has an advisory committee of experts and is operated by a lab team.

The Lab was expected to travel to nine cities over the course of six years.  In 2013, however, BMW ended its support of the project, and the project ended in 2014, with an exhibition in New York.&lt;ref name=BMWend&gt;Vogel, Carol. [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/bmw-ends-support-for-guggenheim-lab-project/ "BMW Ends Support for Guggenheim Lab Project"], ''The New York Times'', July 2, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept, organization and structures==
The concept behind the lab was developed by David van der Leer, assistant curator, architecture and urban studies, and Maria Nicanor, assistant curator, architecture, [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]. The lab's advisory committee is composed of internationally renowned experts in a range of fields and nominates members for each city's lab team, an interdisciplinary group that will help create the programming for that location.&lt;ref name=vogel1&gt;Carol Vogel, "A Lab on a Mission", ''The New York Times'', May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Committee&gt;"Six-Year Collaboration to Examine Contemporary Urban Issues in Nine Cities Around the World – International Advisory Committee Selects New York BMW Guggenheim Lab Team – Design of First Mobile Laboratory", Associated Press, May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Three different structures were to house the lab over the life of the project, each of which could be moved and would travel to three cities. Only one structure was built.  It was designed by the Tokyo-based architecture firm [[Atelier Bow-Wow]]. [[Seoul]]-based graphic designers Sulki &amp; Min created the graphic identity for the project, including an interactive logo that changed over the course of the project.&lt;ref name=mobile&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/press-room/releases/4121-bglmay6 "BMW Guggenheim Lab to Launch in New York City on August 3 Before Traveling to Berlin and Asia"], Guggenheim Foundation, May 6, 2011, accessed January 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vogel2&gt;Vogel, Carol.

The lab's three-city cycle was designed around the theme ''Confronting Comfort'', which explores ways of making urban environments more responsive to people's needs, striking a balance between individual and collective comfort, and promoting environmental and social responsibility.  The program was designed to proactively engage residents from each city, and participants on the Internet and from around the world, in free programs and experiments, and it addressed ideas and issues of particular relevance to each city.&lt;ref name=GuggLabSite&gt;[http://www.bmwguggenheimlab.org "What Is the Lab?"], The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Retrieved April 9, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Advisory Committee members are: [[Daniel Barenboim]], [[Elizabeth Diller]], [[Nicholas Humphrey]], [[Muchadeyi Masunda]], [[Enrique Peñalosa]], [[Juliet Schor]], [[Rirkrit Tiravanija]], and [[Wang Shi (entrepreneur)|Wang Shi]].&lt;ref name=vogel1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Committee/&gt;

==New York City==
The lab was open from August 3 to October 16, 2011, in New York City's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] and was attended by over 54,000 visitors from 60 countries.&lt;ref name=vogel2/&gt;  Members of the New York Lab Team were Omar Freilla, founder and coordinator of [[Green Worker Cooperatives]], [[Bronx]], New York; [[Charles Montgomery (writer)|Charles Montgomery]], Canadian journalist and urban experimentalist; Olatunbosun Obayomi, Nigerian [[microbiologist]] and inventor; and architects and [[urbanists]] Elma van Boxel and Kristian Koreman, founders of [[Zones Urbaines Sensible (consulting)|Zones Urbaines Sensible]], [[Rotterdam]]. The first Public Programs Manager in New York City was Rosanna Flouty.&lt;ref&gt;Boscawen, Rosanna.

==Berlin==
From June 15 to July 29, 2012, the lab was open in Pfefferberg, a complex of galleries and artist studios in [[Prenzlauer Berg]], [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatlanticcities.com/politics/2012/04/following-threats-bmw-guggenheim-lab-finds-new-berlin-location/1665/ "Following Threats, BMW Guggenheim Lab Finds a New Berlin Location"], ''The Atlantic Cities'', April 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Berlin Lab were José Gómez-Márquez, program director for the [[Innovations in International Health]] Initiative (IIH) at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT); Italian architect and engineer [[Carlo Ratti]], who directs the [[MIT Senseable City Lab]]; Berlin-based artist Corinne Rose, who works with photography and video and teaches at the Bern University of the Arts, Switzerland; and Rachel Smith, principal transport planner with [[AECOM]], based in [[Brisbane]].&lt;ref name=vogel2/&gt;&lt;ref name=berlin&gt;[https://www.dexigner.com/news/24158 "BMW Guggenheim Lab Berlin to Open in May 2012"], Dexigner, November 9, 2011, accessed January 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The programming of the Berlin Lab focused on four main topics: Empowerment Technologies (Gómez-Márquez), Dynamic Connections (Smith), Urban Micro-Lens (Rose) and the Senseable (SENSEable) City (Ratti).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Mumbai==
The lab opened in [[Mumbai]], India on December 9, 2012 and ran until January 20, 2013. The central location was on the grounds of the [[Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum]] in Mumbai’s [[Byculla]] neighborhood, with additional satellite locations around the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.artinfo.com/objectlessons/2012/10/22/the-bmw-guggenheim-lab-gets-a-mumbai-makeover/ The BMW Guggenheim Lab Gets a Mumbai Makeover], Artinfo.com, October 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The lab's team consisted of Aisha Dasgupta, a British demographer based in Malawi; Neville Mars, a Dutch architect based in China; Trupti Amritwar Vaitla, an architect and urban transport designer from Mumbai; and Héctor Zamora, a Mexican artist based in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architizer.com/en_us/blog/dyn/58322/bmw-guggenheim-lab-to-launch-in-mumbai/  "BMW Guggenheim Lab to Launch in Mumbai"], Architizer.com, accessed October 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Along with neighborhood-specific public programming, the Mumbai Lab program included participatory research studies and design projects, including a competition to redesign Mumbai's Kala Nagar Junction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitednetworker.com/us/2012/10/22/bmw-guggenheim-lab-mumbai-to-open-december-9-2012-at-dr-bhau-daji-lad-museum-with-pop-up-sites-throughout-the-city/ BMW Guggenheim Lab Mumbai to Open December 9, 2012], UnitedNetworker.com, October 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/six-designs-selected-as-solutions-for-congested-kala-nagar-junction/articleshow/18079917.cms Six designs selected as solutions for congested Kala Nagar junction], ''Times of India'', January 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final exhibition==
The program concluded with an exhibition, ''Participatory City: 100 Urban Trends from the BMW Guggenheim Lab'', which was on view at the New York museum from October 2013 through January 5, 2014.&lt;ref name=BMWend/&gt; The exhibition featured photos and videos from the Lab's public programs and displayed 100 terms representing the "most-talked about words" during the Lab's activities in New York, Berlin, and Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archrecord.construction.com/news/2013/10/131017-BMW-Guggenheim-Lab-Comes-to-a-Close-with-Exhibition.asp BMW Guggenheim Lab Comes to an Early End], Architectural Record, October 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3222">The '''Beutelsbach Consensus''' constitutes a kind of minimum standard of [[Civics|civic]]  (''Politische Bildung'') and [[religious education]] (''Religionsunterricht'') in [[Germany]]. It was developed in the frame of a conference at a small town called [[Beutelsbach (Weinstadt)|Beutelsbach]]  to reanimate the exchange of different didactic schools after a period of deep conflicts. Until today Beutelsbach Consensus is of high importance.

==Main clauses==
=== Prohibition against Overwhelming the Pupil===
It is not permissible to catch pupils unprepared or unaware - by whatever means - for the sake of imparting desirable opinions and to hinder them from `forming an independent judgment’. It is precisely at this point that the dividing line runs between political education and indoctrination. Indoctrination is incompatible with the role of a teacher in a democratic society and the universally accepted objective of making pupils capable of [[Freedom of religion in Germany|independent judgment]] (Mündigkeit).

===Treating Controversial Subjects as Controversial===
Matters which are controversial in intellectual and political affairs must also be taught as controversial in educational instruction. This demand is very closely linked with the first point above, for if differing points of view are lost sight of, options suppressed, and alternatives remain undiscussed, then the path to indoctrination is being trodden. We have to ask whether teachers have in fact a corrective role to play. That is, whether they should or should not specially set out such points of view and alternatives which are foreign to the social and political origins of pupils (and other participants in programs of political education).
In affirming this second basic principle, it becomes clear why the personal standpoint of teachers, the intellectual and theoretical views they represent and their political opinions are relatively uninteresting. To repeat an example that has already been given: their understanding of democracy presents no problems, for opinions contrary to theirs are also being taken into account.

===Giving Weight to the Personal Interests of Pupils===
Pupils must be put in a position to analyse a political situation and to assess how their own personal interests are affected as well as to seek means and ways to influence the political situation they have identified according to their personal interests. Such an objective brings a strong emphasis on the acquisition of the necessary operational skills, which is in turn a logical consequence of the first two principles set out above. In this connection the reproach is sometimes made that this is a `return to formalism’, so that teachers do not have to correct the content of their own beliefs. This is not the case since what is involved here is not a search for a maximum consensus, but the search for a minimal consensus.

'''Blog fiction''' is a form of blogging that can be defined as any forms of narrative written and published through online web journals such as LiveJournal. Fictional blogs are a changing phenomenon with great potential to young writers.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, AA, Fictional Blogs, Uses of Blogs, Peter Lang, Bruns, A &amp; Jacobs, J (ed), New York, pp. 199-210. {{ISBN|0820481246}} (2006) [Research Book Chapter]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the 20th century, there were various authors who were leading the change to bring about the end of the print book. They intend to replace it with a mode of expression that was nonlinear and free to cross as many boundaries as the ever-increasing powers of the computers were making possible.&lt;ref&gt;http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.mga.edu/eds/ebookviewer/ebook?sid=9590c575-d91b-46ef-a66d-65d75126b5d6@sessionmgr102&amp;ppid=Page-__-107&amp;vid=0&amp;format=EK {{full citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=Readers generally cannot access the university proxy link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, blog fiction was developed in 1965; however, it was referred to as a hypertext or web. Well-known philosopher and sociologist Ted Nelson coined the term hypertext. He defined hypertext as "a body of pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that is could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper." Although Ted Nelson was given credit for combining the term and defining hypertext, many people were confused on what tasks it could complete. Most people assumed that it involved linking, like the World Wide Web. After much confusion and speculation about hypertext, the first Hypertext Conference was held in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commforum.mit.edu/hypertext-in-historical-context-vannevar-bush-and-ted-nelson-revisited-bc527272125|title=Hypertext in Historical Context: Vannevar Bush and Ted Nelson Revisited|date=30 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fake or real blogs==
Fictional blogging is all about expressing ideas and creativity. Blog fiction or fictional blogging help readers find who they are. 

Fake blogs, also known as flogs, are misleading web sites that launch [[scareware]] and post ads and comments to a real blog site to lure readers to the page. The con artists who run these sites currently make an estimated $750 million a year by selling products of miracle cures to phony anti-virus software and items of questionable value. Most of them have one article posing as impartial new report commenting on a miracle product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scambusters.org/fakeblog.html|title=8 Clues That Point to a Fake Blog.html|website=www.scambusters.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real blog fiction===

Fictional blogging can be a personal journal or diary that is posted online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogbasics.com/what-is-a-blog/|title=What Is a Blog? - Blog Basics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Though many critics and literary scholars dismiss blog fiction as an inferior and faddish literary form, there is a trend towards the recognition of blogs as a legitimate arena of fiction production. For instance, self-publishing provider Lulu sponsors the [[Lulu Blooker Prize]], which began in 2006. The Blooker prize is an award given to the best "blook" of the year: a work of fiction begun as blog fiction and then transformed into a printed publication. Thus, even despite the radical and democratizing potential of blog fiction, printed works still maintain greater authority and "official" status in the world of fiction and academia. 

Some people{{who|date=December 2017}} say blog fiction is not true blogging and that blogs should not contain fake content. However, blog fiction and regular blogging are all the same.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} In fictional blogging, writers talk about fictional subject matter and also write about real life events but with fictional characteristics. Blog fiction is what a blogger makes of it.

'''CalCOFI''' ('''California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations''') is a multi-agency partnership formed in 1949 to investigate the collapse of the [[sardine]] population off California.
The organization's members are from [[NOAA]] Fisheries Service, [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], and [[California Department of Fish and Wildlife]].  The scope of this research has evolved into the study of [[marine ecosystems]] off [[California]] and the management of its [[fisheries]] resources. 
In 2004, the CalCOFI survey area became one of 26 [[LTER]] (Long Term Ecological Research, www.lternet.edu) research sites.
This time-series of oceanographic and fisheries data allows scientists to assess the human impact and effects of climate change on the coastal ocean ecosystem.

==Origin==
The Pacific [[Sardine]] Fishery was once the largest fishery by volume of the North American Pacific Coast. The fishery developed in the 1920s, peaking in the 1930s with Sardine landings reaching over 700,000 tons in California, but was followed by a precipitous collapse in the 1940s.&lt;ref name=Radovich82/&gt; Recommendations and early warnings of a fishery collapse were given throughout the period with an emphasis of setting annual catch limits given by fishery scientists for example Scofield and [[Frances Naomi Clark|Frances Clark]].&lt;ref name=Scofield31/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clark39/&gt;  Disregarding the early warnings the Pacific [[Sardine]] fishery continued in part driven by the wartime requirement for cheap sources of protein and by the 1940s and 1950s catches declined by an order of magnitude to 80,000 tons. In the decade that followed sardine catches continued to decline to 20,000 tons in the 1960s.

The Sardine Fishery collapse was a major catalyst to the development of the California Cooperative Sardine Research Program- a precursor to the CalCOFI program. The consensus concern for the program was whether this collapse was due to increased fishing pressure or [[environmental change]]. The program was initially led by [[Oscar Elton Sette]], who forged a collaboration between research institutions ([[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]]) and government agencies ([[California Fish and Game Commission]]- recently renamed the [[California Department of Fish and Wildlife]]- and the [[United States Fish Commission]]- now known as the [[NOAA Fisheries]] Service) with the goal of resource management and fisheries conservation of the Eastern Pacific.&lt;ref name=Kendall98/&gt;

The CalCOFI program was initially met with skepticism. The program was seen as a diversionary tactic initiating further picayune studies of sardine abundance to delay sardine catch regulations.&lt;ref name=Scofield/&gt; Nevertheless, after the sardine fishery reached a low point in 1947 efforts were focused on the investigation of the underlying forces that govern sardine abundance.&lt;ref name=MRC/&gt;

==Sampling Pattern==
The CalCOFI Station pattern was based on a centric-systematic-area design&lt;ref name=Milne59/&gt;

CalCOFI sampling lines were designed to be normal to the central [[California coast]] centered at [[Point Conception]], designated as CalCOFI Line 80. The original sampling pattern extended from Line 10 at the US-Canada border to Line 120 off Point Eugenia, Baja California Mexico with a spacing of 120 miles between lines (i.e. distance between line 80 and 90 is 120 miles). Since its conception, additional lines were added within the domain creating a 40-mile spacing between lines which are now numbered in fractions of 3s and 7s (80, 83, 87, 90, etc.).&lt;ref name=Kramer72/&gt;

Regular surveying began in 1951, however CalCOFI data go back to 1949. Like all research and fishery surveys, there are many variables which play a role in the design of the survey pattern. The CalCOFI program has surveyed a wide variety of spatial ranges. Thus, CalCOFI surveys are generally grouped into sampling domains which are commonly covered over the duration of this ecological study&lt;ref name=Kramer72 /&gt;

The largest sampling domain, which has been covered multiple times, is the area from the California-Oregon border to the tip of Baja California Sur, Mexico. This region was heavily surveyed in the 1950s (1951, 1952, 1954, 1956, 1958-1960, and 1972). Another large domain runs from [[San Francisco]] to southern [[Baja California]] (surveyed in 1953, 1955, 1957, 1961-1966, 1968, 1974, 1975, 1978, 1980, and 1981).

The sampling domain extending from [[San Diego]] to [[Avila Beach]] is today called the "core CalCOFI area". These 66 stations have been covered over the entire time series, with exceptions only due to years where no cruises were conducted. A series of inshore southern stations all at a water depth of approximately 20 m have been added to the core CalCOFI pattern in 2004, resulting in a 75 station pattern.

Less common sampling patterns of intermediate domain have also been conducted. This includes a survey region from [[San Francisco]] to [[San Diego]] which has become increasingly sampled during the spring survey, because the domain covers an expanded region of known sardine spawning grounds. The data from these spring cruise are heavily relied upon for sardine stock assessment and other related research.

Every line apart from the CalCOFI sampling scheme and its corresponding stations has experienced some degree of difference and variation in spatial and temporal sampling frequency. Furthermore, technological advances have allowed increasing amounts of new chemical, physical, and biological properties to be measured within the water column. Line 90, which is a part of the core CalCOFI station domain positioned across the mid-[[Southern California Bight]], is the best-sampled and most visited line in the time series. The data from Line 90 is used in many transect figures and analyses.

There are a variety of similar survey programs collecting analogous data across the west coast. These programs range in temporal and spatial extent. One such program is the Investigaciones Mexicanas de la Corriente de California (IMECOCAL) program out of Mexico which samples the Eastern Pacific around [[Baja California]].&lt;ref name=Barlow2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baumgartner2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Emmett2005/&gt;

==Gear Used==
A variety of nets and related instrumentation has been deployed on CalCOFI cruises over the years. many of these have been developed for use by the CalCOFI program. Oblique tows using a bongo net are employed to sample for micronekton, [[mesozooplankton]] and [[ichthyoplankton]]. Vertical tows for [[icthyoplankton]] and [[mesozooplankton]] are conducted using a Pairovet and PRPOOS nets. Finally, surface tows with a Manta net are used to sample [[neuston]]. Supplementary sampling focuses on collection of juvenile and small fish via trawling techniques. This includes using a Modified Isaacs Kidd Net, a Matsuda Oozeki Hu trawl (MOHT), and the Nordic rope trawl.

===CalCOFI Nets===
{| class="wikitable"
|+ CalCOFI Nets
|-
! scope="col" | Net Name
! scope="col" | Description
|-
! [[Bongo Net]]
| Paired ringed nets towed obliquely from a depth of approx. 210m to the surface with ship speed at approx. 1-2 knots. Water is filtered through the 505 [[micron]] [[nylon]] mesh nets with a mouth [[diameter]] of 0.71m.&lt;ref name=Kramer72 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith77 /&gt; The right side net is preserved in buffered 5% [[formalin]] and the left side in 90% [[ethanol]]. The [[bongo net]] is designed to collect [[mesozooplankton]] and its samples are critical in determining [[Egg (biology)|egg]] and [[larval]] [[Mortality rate|mortality]]. The data is used in the [[Daily Egg Production Method]] for estimating the [[spawning stock biomass]] of sardine.&lt;ref name=Lo89 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lo2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lo2010/&gt;  The net functions more efficiently at night due to the decreased amount of net avoidance by the [[zooplankton]].&lt;ref name=Ohman95 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lavaniegos2003/&gt; Tow depth, net configuration, mesh size and materials have been evolving since the program began. Comparisons of different net methodology and potential ramifications have been published.&lt;ref name=Kramer72 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ahlstrom54/&gt;
|-
! [[Pairovet]]
| The [[Pairovet]] is used to collect [[ichthyoplankton]] via vertical tows from 70m to the [[sea-surface]] using paired 0.05m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 150 [[micron]] [[nylon]] mesh nets. The smaller nylon mesh is specially designed to retain [[fish eggs]] which are found in the upper 70m.&lt;ref name=Ahlstrom59/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moser98/&gt;  The net is employed specifically to collect [[anchovy]] [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] with 100% efficiency.&lt;ref name=Smith85/&gt;  The aim of the Pairovet is to sample a constant [[volume]] of water at each site, thus it is crucial to keep the net straight up and down. Ship pitch and roll, water currents, net clogs, wire angle, and dragging in the [[neuston]] layer all are possible sources of variance and error. These potential [[variable (research)|variable]]s may force sample out of the mouth of the device, and/or sample loss due to destruction of eggs.&lt;ref name=Hewitt83/&gt;
|-
! [[Manta Net]]
| The [[manta net]] was developed to sample the [[sea-surface]] over a range of oceanic conditions. The net is able to veer away from the side of the vessel to avoid ship wake and have a mouth unobstructed by a bridle that might cause avoidance by organisms.&lt;ref name=Brown81/&gt; The net collects [[neuston]] or the animals found on the sea-surface via filtering water over a 505 [[micron]] net fixed with a 333 micron codend. A variety of [[fish]] species have a prolonged [[Metamorphosis|transformation]] between [[larval]] and [[Juvenile (organism)|juvenile]] stages of development during which time the organisms can be found in the surface layer.

===Supplementary Nets===
{| class="wikitable"
|+ Supplementary Nets
|-
! scope="col" | Net Name
! scope="col" | Description
|-
! [[Nordic Surface Trawl]]
| Trawl aimed to sample and collect [[pelagic fish]].&lt;ref name=Griffith2008/&gt; Samples the water using wide trawl doors with a 600m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; mouth area filtering water with an 8mm mesh. The net retains juveniles and certain large larval fish. Recently the net has been fastened with a [[marine mammal excluder device (MMEL)]] to decrease the amount of mammalian impact and mortality.&lt;ref name=Dotson2010/&gt; Data retrieved by the net is used to better understand fishery species [[spawning stock biomass]], in particular the data is important for the [[Daily Egg Production Method]] as it samples a wide distribution of species and size-classes.&lt;ref name=Lo2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lasker85/&gt;  Additionally, size structure data is paramount in the use of acoustic biomass estimates.&lt;ref name=Zwolinski2012/&gt;
|-
! [[Modified Isaacs Kidd Trawl]]
| Trawl designed to sample [[juvenile pelagic fish]] which can avoid other sampling nets by mid-water trawls. The primary target is mid-sized [[anchovy]] (15 – 60mm).&lt;ref name=Methot86 /&gt; The frame samples a large volume of water while minimizing avoidance by the target organisms. The net filters about 7,000m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or 100 times as much water per tow as a standard [[bongo net]].&lt;ref name=Methot86/&gt;
|-
! [[Matsuda-Oozeki-Hu (MOHT) Trawl]]
| Trawl designed to capture a multitude of mesopelagic organisms including: [[krill]], late larval and juvenile fishes, and [[micronekton]]. Collects juvenile and small fish assemblages in conjunction with [[multifrequency acoustics]] to estimate the distribution and biomass of sampled species. The [[MOHT]] has a 5.5m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; mouth opening, and filters the water at up to 4.5 knots in a variety of oceanic conditions. The MOHT is fixed with a range of codend filters to sample a variety of different size classes. It samples the mesopelagic community in a better manner then the bongo or the rope trawl and its data is highly valuable in the determination of health and abundance of important fisheries.&lt;ref name=Oozeki2004/&gt;
|-
! [[PRPOOS]]
| The name of the PRPOOS net is derived from its use during the Planktonic Rate Processes in Oligotrophic Ocean Systems program.  It was formerly known as the Soutar-Hemmigway Animal Trap or “SHAT”.  The net was introduced to CalCOFI cruises by the CCE-LTER program and it is a net designed to sample zooplankton using a 202 micron mesh net with a 50&amp;nbsp;cm diameter. The net is towed vertically to a depth of 210 m.&lt;ref name=Kramer72/&gt;
|-
! [[Continuous Underway Fish Egg Sampler (CUFES)]]
| Developed in the mid-1990s to identify fish eggs using video/[[optical plankton counter]]. The sampler functions by constantly pumping water from about 3m depth. The water passes through a variety of sampling collectors including an optical plankton counter.&lt;ref name=Checkley97/&gt;  Conceived to automate the collection and sorting of fish species, but though it gave promising results, manual identification is still required of the samples to minimize error and misidentification.&lt;ref name=Checkley2000/&gt; The problem is that many pelagic fish eggs share similar optical properties with copepod. Despite this hiccup, the [[CUFES]] is invaluable in the sampling of [[sardine]] and [[anchovy]] [[habitats]].&lt;ref name=Checkley97 /&gt; CUFES data from cruises are commonly used with surface [[temperature]] and [[salinity]] data to show water mass characteristics where sardine, anchovy, and other important fishery species [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]].&lt;ref name=Checkley2000 /&gt; The common use of the CUFES at sea is to inform where patches of high egg density are located which can be sampled via nets. The CUFES also impacts the relative [[confidence level]] of net sampling.&lt;ref name=Lo2001/&gt; A variety of research is conducted to determine the relationship between CUFES egg data and net ([[pairvet]], [[PRPOOS]], etc.) sampled data. Confidence in relations determined is still in question. Thus, CUFES data alone cannot be used to determine estimates of stock biomass.&lt;ref name=Checkley97 /&gt; Nevertheless, the CUFES is an important tool in describing surface patchiness, providing extra data by designating an area as high or low surface egg density.&lt;ref name=Lo2001 /&gt;

The '''Center for Jewish Art''' ('''CJA''') is a research institute at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], devoted to the documentation and research of Jewish visual culture. Established in 1979, it documented and researched objects of Jewish art in ca. 700 museums, libraries, private collections and synagogues in 41 countries. Today, the Center's archives and collections constitute the largest and most comprehensive body of information on Jewish art in existence. The CJA’s research and documentation is included in the Bezalel Narkiss Index of Jewish Art.

==History==
The Center for Jewish Art at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] was established in 1979 by Professor [[Bezalel Narkiss]], [[Israel Prize]] laureate, with an aim to document objects of Jewish art and produce a comprehensive iconographical index of Jewish subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cja.huji.ac.il/About_Us.html |title=About Us |publisher=Cja.huji.ac.il |date=2015-02-09 |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center was an outcome of Narkiss’s iconographical research of medieval Hebrew illuminated manuscripts, which he initiated with Professor Gabrielle Sed-Rajna in 1974. The Index initially consisted of four sections: a Section of Hebrew Illuminated Manuscripts, of Sacred and Ritual Objects, of Ancient Jewish Art, and of Modern Jewish Art.

Professor [[Bezalel Narkiss]] headed the CJA until 1991. The next director, Professor Aliza Cohen-Mushlin, established a fifth section for Jewish Ritual Architecture and Funerary Art. Under her leadership the CJA undertook many research expeditions to post-Communist Central and Eastern Europe, in order to measure endangered synagogues and tombstones in regions, which were previously inaccessible to western scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://thesourceisrael.com/issue19/tour_article/ |title=Center for Jewish Art &amp;#124; The Source |website=Thesourceisrael.com |date=2006-02-22 |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, from 1994 CJA documented those synagogues in Germany which survived the Nazi regime and were not demolished in [[Kristallnacht]]. The documentation projects in Germany were done in cooperation with the Department of Architectural History at the Technical University in Braunschweig, headed by Professor Harmen H. Thies. In 1997 this cooperation was institutionalized as Bet Tfila Research Unit for Jewish Architecture in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bet-tfila.org/indexen.html |title=Bet Tfila – Forschungsstelle |website=Bet-tfila.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
* ''Jewish Art'' (in 1974-1985, ''Journal of Jewish Art'') is an annual devoted to the research of Jewish art. Its editors were [[Bezalel Narkiss]] and Aliza Cohen-Mushlin; Professors Ziva Amishai-Maisels and Bianca Kühnel served as guest editors of two issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cja.huji.ac.il/Publications/JA.html |title=Jewish Art Journal |publisher=Cja.huji.ac.il |date=2014-10-21 |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Rimonim'' (רימונים) is a Hebrew journal on Jewish art, aiming at bringing the results of academic research to a wider Israeli audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cja.huji.ac.il/Publications/RIMONIM.html |title=Rimonim |publisher=Cja.huji.ac.il |date=2014-10-21 |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1976-1994 the Center for Jewish Art published ten volumes of ''Jerusalem Index of Jewish Art'' as collections of card on Hebrew illuminated manuscripts, ritual objects and ancient Jewish art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cja.huji.ac.il/Publications/ija2.html |title=The Center for Jewish Art |publisher=Cja.huji.ac.il |date=2014-10-21 |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* From 2007, Beit Tfila publishes a series of monographs on Jewish architecture and a series of smaller studies on individual Jewish buildings. The editors of both series are Aliza Cohen-Mushlin and Harmen Thies, and they are published by the Imhoff Verlag in English and German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bet-tfila.org/en/p-publ.htm |title=Publications of the Bet Tfila – Research Unit |website=Bet-tfila.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bezalel Narkiss Index of Jewish Art==
The Bezalel Narkiss Index of Jewish Art is a largest virtual Jewish museum in the word, which includes about 250,000 images from ca. 700 museums, libraries, private collections and synagogues in 41 countries, as well as architectural plans of ca. 1,500 synagogues documented in situ. The images are classified according to their iconographical subject, type of objects, origin, and date. The digitization of the Index is being undertaken in cooperation with the [[National Library of Israel]] and the Judaica Division of [[Harvard University Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/gallery/art/1.1641039 |title=המרכז לאמנות יהודית יזכה לתמיכה של 3 מיליון שקל - אמנות - הארץ |publisher=Haaretz.co.il |date=2012-02-14 |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.nli.org.il/sites/NLI/English/digitallibrary/cja/Pages/default.aspx |title=The Center for Jewish Art Collection |publisher=Web.nli.org.il |date=2010-10-07 |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.slideshare.net/evaminerva/d1-vladimir-levincenterforjewish-artevaminerva2013 |title=D1 vladimir levin center for jewish art eva minerva 2013 |website=Slideshare.net |date= |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chaos theory''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] focusing on the behavior of [[dynamical system]]s that are highly sensitive to [[initial conditions]]. "Chaos" is an interdisciplinary theory stating that within the apparent randomness of [[chaotic complex system]]s, there are underlying patterns, constant [[feedback loops]], repetition, [[self-similarity]], [[fractals]], [[self-organization]], and reliance on programming at the initial point known as ''sensitive dependence on initial conditions''. The [[butterfly effect]] describes how a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state, e.g. a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can cause a hurricane in Texas.&lt;ref name="bo1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://geoffboeing.com/2015/03/chaos-theory-logistic-map/ |author = Boeing |title = Chaos Theory and the Logistic Map |date = 2015 |accessdate = 2015-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small differences in initial conditions, such as those due to rounding errors in numerical computation, yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction of their behavior impossible in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Kellert |first = Stephen H. |title = In the Wake of Chaos: Unpredictable Order in Dynamical Systems |publisher = University of Chicago Press |year = 1993 |isbn = 978-0-226-42976-2 |page = 32 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geoffboeing.com/publications/nonlinear-chaos-fractals-prediction/|author=Boeing, G.|title=Visual Analysis of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: Chaos, Fractals, Self-Similarity and the Limits of Prediction|journal=Systems|date=2016|volume=4|issue=4|pages=37|accessdate=2016-12-02|doi=10.3390/systems4040037}}&lt;/ref&gt; This happens even though these systems are [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]], meaning that their future behavior is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no [[randomness|random]] elements involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kellert|1993|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kellert|1993|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WerndlCharlotte"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Werndl, Charlotte |title = What are the New Implications of Chaos for Unpredictability? |journal = The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |volume = 60 |issue = 1 |pages = 195–220 |year = 2009 |url = http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/60/1/195 |doi = 10.1093/bjps/axn053 |arxiv = 1310.1576 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior is known as '''deterministic chaos''', or simply '''chaos'''.

The theory formed the basis for such fields of study as [[dynamical systems|complex dynamical systems]], [[edge of chaos]] theory, and [[self-assembly]] processes.

==Introduction==
Chaos theory concerns deterministic systems whose behavior can in principle be predicted. Chaotic systems are predictable for a while and then 'appear' to become random.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems" /&gt; The amount of time that the behavior of a chaotic system can be effectively predicted depends on three things: How much uncertainty can be tolerated in the forecast, how accurately its current state can be measured, and a time scale depending on the dynamics of the system, called the [[Lyapunov time]]. Some examples of Lyapunov times are: chaotic electrical circuits, about 1 millisecond; weather systems, a few  days (unproven); the solar system, 50 million years. In chaotic systems, the uncertainty in a forecast increases [[Exponential growth|exponentially]] with elapsed time. Hence, mathematically, doubling the forecast time more than squares the proportional uncertainty in the forecast. This means, in practice, a meaningful prediction cannot be made over an interval of more than two or three times the Lyapunov time. When meaningful predictions cannot be made, the system appears random.&lt;ref&gt;''Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order'', Steven Strogatz, Hyperion, New York, 2003, pages 189–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chaotic dynamics==
[[File:Chaos Sensitive Dependence.svg|thumb|The map defined by &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x'')&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''y'' → (''x'' + ''y)'' [[Modulo operation|mod]] 1&lt;/span&gt; displays sensitivity to initial x positions. Here, two series of ''x'' and ''y'' values diverge markedly over time from a tiny initial difference.]]
In common usage, "chaos" means "a state of disorder".&lt;ref&gt;Definition of {{linktext|chaos}} at [[Wiktionary]];&lt;/ref&gt; However, in chaos theory, the term is defined more precisely. Although no universally accepted mathematical definition of chaos exists, a commonly used definition originally formulated by [[Robert L. Devaney]] says that, to classify a dynamical system as chaotic, it must have these properties:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A First Course in Dynamics: With a Panorama of Recent Developments|last=Hasselblatt|first=Boris|author2=Anatole Katok|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-58750-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# it must be sensitive to initial conditions
# it must be [[topological mixing|topologically mixing]]
# it must have [[dense set|dense]] [[periodic orbit]]s

In some cases, the last two properties in the above have been shown to actually imply sensitivity to initial conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Elaydi, Saber N. |title=Discrete Chaos |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |year=1999 |isbn=978-1-58488-002-8 |page=117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Basener, William F. |title=Topology and its applications |publisher=Wiley |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-471-68755-9 |page=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, while it is often the most practically significant property, "sensitivity to initial conditions" need not be stated in the definition.

If attention is restricted to [[Interval (mathematics)|intervals]], the second property implies the other two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vellekoop, Michel |author2=Berglund, Raoul |title=On Intervals, Transitivity = Chaos |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=101 |issue=4 |pages=353–5 |date=April 1994 |jstor=2975629 |doi=10.2307/2975629}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative, and in general weaker, definition of chaos uses only the first two properties in the above list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Medio, Alfredo |author2=Lines, Marji |title=Nonlinear Dynamics: A Primer |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-521-55874-7 |page=165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within this picture, the long-range dynamical behavior associated with chaotic dynamics, e.g., the [[butterfly effect]], is a consequence of the [[Goldstone's theorem]] in the application to the spontaneous topological supersymmetry breaking.

===Sensitivity to initial conditions===
{{Main|Butterfly effect}}
[[File:SensInitCond.gif|thumb|Lorenz equations used to generate plots for the y variable. The initial conditions for ''x'' and ''z'' were kept the same but those for ''y'' were changed between '''1.001''', '''1.0001''' and '''1.00001'''. The values for &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; were '''45.92''', '''16''' and '''4 ''' respectively. As can be seen, even the slightest difference in initial values causes significant changes after about 12 seconds of evolution in the three cases. This is an example of sensitive dependence on initial conditions.]]
'''Sensitivity to initial conditions''' means that each point in a chaotic system is arbitrarily closely approximated by other points with significantly different future paths, or trajectories. Thus, an arbitrarily small change, or perturbation, of the current trajectory may lead to significantly different future behavior.

Sensitivity to initial conditions is popularly known as the "[[butterfly effect]]", so-called because of the title of a paper given by [[Edward Lorenz]] in 1972 to the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in Washington, D.C., entitled ''Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil set off a Tornado in Texas?''. The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which causes a chain of events that prevents the predictability of large-scale phenomena. Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the overall system would have been vastly different.

A consequence of sensitivity to initial conditions is that if we start with a limited amount of information about the system (as is usually the case in practice), then beyond a certain time the system is no longer predictable. This is most prevalent in the case of weather, which is generally predictable only about a week ahead.&lt;ref name="RGW"&gt;{{cite book |author=Watts, Robert G. |title=Global Warming and the Future of the Earth |publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool |year=2007 |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, this does not mean that we cannot say anything about events far in the future; some restrictions on the system are present. With weather, we know that the temperature will not naturally reach 100&amp;nbsp;°C or fall to −130&amp;nbsp;°C on earth (during the current [[geologic era]]), but we can't say exactly what day will have the hottest temperature of the year.

In more mathematical terms, the [[Lyapunov exponent]] measures the sensitivity to initial conditions. Given two starting [[trajectory|trajectories]] in the [[phase space]] that are infinitesimally close, with initial separation &lt;math&gt;\delta \mathbf{Z}_0&lt;/math&gt;, the two trajectories end up diverging at a rate given by

:&lt;math&gt; | \delta\mathbf{Z}(t) | \approx e^{\lambda t} | \delta \mathbf{Z}_0 |,&lt;/math&gt;

where t is the time and λ is the Lyapunov exponent. The rate of separation depends on the orientation of the initial separation vector, so a whole spectrum of Lyapunov exponents exist. The number of Lyapunov exponents is equal to the number of dimensions of the phase space, though it is common to just refer to the largest one. For example, the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE) is most often used because it determines the overall predictability of the system. A positive MLE is usually taken as an indication that the system is chaotic.

Also, other properties relate to sensitivity of initial conditions, such as [[Measure (mathematics)|measure-theoretical]] [[Mixing (mathematics)|mixing]] (as discussed in [[ergodicity|ergodic]] theory) and properties of a [[Kolmogorov automorphism|K-system]].&lt;ref name="WerndlCharlotte" /&gt;

===Topological mixing===
[[File:LogisticTopMixing1-6.gif|thumb|Six iterations of a set of states &lt;math&gt;[x,y]&lt;/math&gt;  passed through the logistic map. (a) the blue plot (legend 1) shows the first iterate (initial condition), which essentially forms a circle. Animation shows the first to the sixth iteration of the circular initial conditions. It can be seen that ''mixing'' occurs as we progress in iterations. The sixth iteration shows that the points are almost completely scattered in the phase space. Had we progressed further in iterations, the mixing would have been homogeneous and irreversible. The logistic map has equation &lt;math&gt;x_{k+1} = 4  x_k  (1 - x_k )&lt;/math&gt;. To expand the state-space of the logistic map into two dimensions,  a second state, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, was created as &lt;math&gt;y_{k+1} = x_k + y_k &lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;x_k + y_k &lt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_{k+1} = x_k + y_k -1&lt;/math&gt; otherwise.]]
[[File:Chaos Topological Mixing.png|thumb|The map defined by &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x'')&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''y'' → (''x'' + ''y)'' [[Modulo operation|mod]] 1&lt;/span&gt; also displays [[topological mixing]]. Here, the blue region is transformed by the dynamics first to the purple region, then to the pink and red regions, and eventually to a cloud of vertical lines scattered across the space.]]

'''[[Topological mixing]]''' (or '''topological transitivity''') means that the system evolves over time so that any given region or [[open set]] of its [[phase space]] eventually overlaps with any other given region. This mathematical concept of "mixing" corresponds to the standard intuition, and the mixing of colored [[dye]]s or fluids is an example of a chaotic system.

Topological mixing is often omitted from popular accounts of chaos, which equate chaos with only sensitivity to initial conditions. However, sensitive dependence on initial conditions alone does not give chaos. For example, consider the simple dynamical system produced by repeatedly doubling an initial value. This system has sensitive dependence on initial conditions everywhere, since any pair of nearby points eventually becomes widely separated. However, this example has no topological mixing, and therefore has no chaos. Indeed, it has extremely simple behavior: all points except 0 tend to positive or negative infinity.

===Density of periodic orbits===
For a chaotic system to have [[Dense set|dense]] [[periodic orbits]] means that every point in the space is approached arbitrarily closely by periodic orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devaney|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The one-dimensional [[logistic map]] defined by &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x'')&lt;/span&gt; is one of the simplest systems with density of periodic orbits.  For example, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5-\sqrt{5}}{8}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;→ &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5+\sqrt{5}}{8}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;→ &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5-\sqrt{5}}{8}&lt;/math&gt; (or approximately 0.3454915&amp;nbsp;→ 0.9045085&amp;nbsp;→ 0.3454915) is an (unstable) orbit of period 2, and similar orbits exist for periods 4, 8, 16, etc. (indeed, for all the periods specified by [[Sharkovskii's theorem]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alligood|Sauer|Yorke|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharkovskii's theorem is the basis of the Li and Yorke&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li |first1=T.Y. |last2=Yorke |first2=J.A. |title=Period Three Implies Chaos |journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] |volume=82 |pages=985–92 |year=1975 |url=http://pb.math.univ.gda.pl/chaos/pdf/li-yorke.pdf |format=PDF |author-link=Tien-Yien Li |doi=10.2307/2318254 |issue=10 |author2-link=James A.

===Strange attractors===
[[File:TwoLorenzOrbits.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Lorenz attractor]] displays chaotic behavior.  These two plots demonstrate sensitive dependence on initial conditions within the region of phase space occupied by the attractor.]]
Some dynamical systems, like the one-dimensional [[logistic map]] defined by &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x''),&lt;/span&gt; are chaotic everywhere, but in many cases chaotic behavior is found only in a subset of phase space. The cases of most interest arise when the chaotic behavior takes place on an [[attractor]], since then a large set of initial conditions leads to orbits that converge to this chaotic region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strelioff|first1=Christopher|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Medium-Term Prediction of Chaos|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|date=2006|volume=96|issue=4|pages=044101|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.044101|pmid=16486826|bibcode = 2006PhRvL..96d4101S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An easy way to visualize a chaotic attractor is to start with a point in the [[basin of attraction]] of the attractor, and then simply plot its subsequent orbit. Because of the topological transitivity condition, this is likely to produce a picture of the entire final attractor, and indeed both orbits shown in the figure on the right give a picture of the general shape of the Lorenz attractor.  This attractor results from a simple three-dimensional model of the [[Edward Lorenz|Lorenz]] weather system. The Lorenz attractor is perhaps one of the best-known chaotic system diagrams, probably because it was not only one of the first, but it is also one of the most complex and as such gives rise to a very interesting pattern that, with a little imagination, looks like the wings of a butterfly.

Unlike [[Attractor#Fixed point|fixed-point attractors]] and [[limit cycle]]s, the attractors that arise from chaotic systems, known as [[strange attractor]]s, have great detail and complexity.  Strange attractors occur in both [[continuous function|continuous]] dynamical systems (such as the Lorenz system) and in some [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] systems (such as the [[Hénon map]]). Other discrete dynamical systems have a repelling structure called a [[Julia set]], which forms at the boundary between basins of attraction of fixed points. Julia sets can be thought of as strange repellers. Both strange attractors and Julia sets typically have a [[fractal]] structure, and the [[fractal dimension]] can be calculated for them.

===Minimum complexity of a chaotic system===
[[File:LogisticMap BifurcationDiagram.png|thumb|right|[[Bifurcation diagram]] of the [[logistic map]] &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''x'' → ''r'' ''x'' (1 – ''x'').&lt;/span&gt;  Each vertical slice shows the attractor for a specific value of ''r''.  The diagram displays [[Period-doubling bifurcation|period-doubling]] as ''r'' increases, eventually producing chaos.]]

Discrete chaotic systems, such as the logistic map, can exhibit strange attractors whatever their [[dimension]]ality. In contrast, for [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] dynamical systems, the [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem]] shows that a strange attractor can only arise in three or more dimensions.  [[Dimension (vector space)|Finite-dimensional]] [[linear system]]s are never chaotic; for a dynamical system to display chaotic behavior, it must be either [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] or infinite-dimensional.

The [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem]] states that a two-dimensional differential equation has very regular behavior. The Lorenz attractor discussed below is generated by a system of three [[differential equation]]s such as:
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= \sigma y - \sigma x, \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= \rho x - x z - y, \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= x y - \beta z.
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; make up the [[State space representation|system state]], &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is time, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are the system [[parameter]]s. Five of the terms on the right hand side are linear, while two are quadratic; a total of seven terms. Another well-known chaotic attractor is generated by the [[Rössler map|Rössler equations]], which have only one nonlinear term out of seven. Sprott&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sprott |first=J.C.|year=1997|title=Simplest dissipative chaotic flow|journal=[[Physics Letters A]]|volume=228|issue=4–5 |pages=271–274|doi=10.1016/S0375-9601(97)00088-1|bibcode = 1997PhLA..228..271S }}&lt;/ref&gt; found a three-dimensional system with just five terms, that had only one nonlinear term, which exhibits chaos for certain parameter values.

The reason is, simply put, that solutions to such systems are asymptotic to a two-dimensional surface and therefore solutions are well behaved.

While the Poincaré–Bendixson theorem shows that a continuous dynamical system on the Euclidean [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] cannot be chaotic, two-dimensional continuous systems with [[non-Euclidean geometry]] can exhibit chaotic behavior.&lt;ref name="Rosario 2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosario|first=Pedro|title=Underdetermination of Science: Part I|date=2006|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1411693913}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps surprisingly, chaos may occur also in linear systems, provided they are infinite dimensional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A theory of linear chaos is being developed in a branch of mathematical analysis known as [[functional analysis]].

=== Jerk systems ===
In [[physics]], [[Jerk (physics)|jerk]] is the third derivative of [[position (vector)|position]], with respect to time.  As such, differential equations of the form
:: &lt;math&gt;J\left(\overset{...}{x},\ddot{x},\dot {x},x\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;
are sometimes called ''Jerk equations''. It has been shown that a jerk equation, which is equivalent to a system of three first order, ordinary, non-linear differential equations, is in a certain sense the minimal setting for solutions showing chaotic behaviour. This motivates mathematical interest in jerk systems. Systems involving a fourth or higher derivative are called accordingly hyperjerk systems.&lt;ref&gt;K. E. Chlouverakis and J. C. Sprott, Chaos Solitons &amp; Fractals 28, 739–746 (2005), Chaotic Hyperjerk Systems, http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pubs/paper297.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A jerk system's behavior is described by a jerk equation, and for certain jerk equations, simple electronic circuits can model solutions. These circuits are known as jerk circuits.

One of the most interesting properties of jerk circuits is the possibility of chaotic behavior. In fact, certain well-known chaotic systems, such as the Lorenz attractor and the [[Rössler map]], are conventionally described as a system of three first-order differential equations that can combine into a single (although rather complicated) jerk equation. Nonlinear jerk systems are in a sense minimally complex systems to show chaotic behaviour; there is no chaotic system involving only two first-order, ordinary differential equations (the system resulting in an equation of second order only).

An example of a jerk equation with nonlinearity in the magnitude of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}^3 x}{\mathrm{d} t^3}+A\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 x}{\mathrm{d} t^2}+\frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{d} t}-|x|+1=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''A'' is an adjustable parameter. This equation has a chaotic solution for ''A''=3/5 and can be implemented with the following jerk circuit; the required nonlinearity is brought about by the two diodes:

[[File:JerkCircuit01.png|frameless|upright=1.4|center]]

In the above circuit, all resistors are of equal value, except &lt;math&gt;R_A=R/A=5R/3&lt;/math&gt;, and all capacitors are of equal size. The dominant frequency is &lt;math&gt;1/2\pi R C&lt;/math&gt;. The output of [[operational amplifier|op amp]] 0 will correspond to the x variable, the output of 1 corresponds to the first derivative of x and the output of 2 corresponds to the second derivative.

==Spontaneous order==
Under the right conditions, chaos spontaneously evolves into a lockstep pattern. In the [[Kuramoto model]], four conditions suffice to produce synchronization in a chaotic system.
Examples include the [[coupled oscillation]] of [[Christiaan Huygens]]' pendulums, fireflies, [[neuron]]s, the [[London Millennium Bridge]] resonance, and large arrays of [[Josephson junctions]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Strogatz, ''Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order'', Hyperion, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early proponent of chaos theory was [[Henri Poincaré]]. In the 1880s, while studying the [[three-body problem]], he found that there can be orbits that are nonperiodic, and yet not forever increasing nor approaching a fixed point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poincaré, Jules Henri |title=Sur le problème des trois corps et les équations de la dynamique.

Despite initial insights in the first half of the twentieth century, chaos theory became formalized as such only after mid-century, when it first became evident to some scientists that [[linear theory]], the prevailing system theory at that time, simply could not explain the observed behavior of certain experiments like that of the [[logistic map]]. What had been attributed to measure imprecision and simple "[[Pseudorandom noise|noise]]" was considered by chaos theorists as a full component of the studied systems.

The main catalyst for the development of chaos theory was the electronic computer. Much of the mathematics of chaos theory involves the repeated [[iteration]] of simple mathematical formulas, which would be impractical to do by hand. Electronic computers made these repeated calculations practical, while figures and images made it possible to visualize these systems. As a graduate student in [[Chihiro Hayashi]]'s laboratory at Kyoto University, [[Yoshisuke Ueda]] was experimenting with analog computers and noticed, on November 27, 1961, what he called "randomly transitional phenomena".  Yet his advisor did not agree with his conclusions at the time, and did not allow him to report his findings until 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abraham|Ueda|2001|loc=See Chapters 3 and 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sprott|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SEDjdjPZ158C&amp;pg=PA89 89]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Airplane vortex edit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Turbulence]] in the [[Wingtip vortices|tip vortex]] from an [[airplane]] wing. Studies of the critical point beyond which a system creates turbulence were important for chaos theory, analyzed for example by the [[Soviet physicists|Soviet physicist]] [[Lev Landau]], who developed the [[Landau-Hopf theory of turbulence]]. [[David Ruelle]] and [[Floris Takens]] later predicted, against Landau, that [[fluid turbulence]] could develop through a [[strange attractor]], a main concept of chaos theory.]]

[[Edward Lorenz]] was an early pioneer of the theory. His interest in chaos came about accidentally through his work on [[meteorology|weather prediction]] in 1961.&lt;ref name=Lorenz1961&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lorenz, Edward N. |title=Deterministic non-periodic flow |journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |volume=20 |pages=130–141 |year=1963 |doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:DNF&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issue=2 |bibcode=1963JAtS...20..130L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenz was using a simple digital computer, a [[Royal McBee]] [[LGP-30]], to run his weather simulation. He wanted to see a sequence of data again, and to save time he started the simulation in the middle of its course. He did this by entering a printout of the data that corresponded to conditions in the middle of the original simulation. To his surprise, the weather the machine began to predict was completely different from the previous calculation. Lorenz tracked this down to the computer printout. The computer worked with 6-digit precision, but the printout rounded variables off to a 3-digit number, so a value like 0.506127 printed as 0.506. This difference is tiny, and the consensus at the time would have been that it should have no practical effect. However, Lorenz discovered that small changes in initial conditions produced large changes in long-term outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Chaos: Making a New Science]] |last=Gleick |first=James |year=1987 |publisher=Cardinal |location=London|page=17|isbn=978-0-434-29554-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenz's discovery, which gave its name to [[Lorenz attractor]]s, showed that even detailed atmospheric modelling cannot, in general, make precise long-term weather predictions.

In 1963, [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] found recurring patterns at every scale in data on cotton prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Benoît|last = Mandelbrot|year = 1963|title = The variation of certain speculative prices|journal = Journal of Business|volume = 36|pages = 394–419|doi = 10.1086/294632|issue = 4|jstor=2350970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beforehand he had studied [[information theory]] and concluded noise was patterned like a [[Cantor set]]: on any scale the proportion of noise-containing periods to error-free periods was a constant – thus errors were inevitable and must be planned for by incorporating redundancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Berger J.M. |author2=Mandelbrot B. | year = 1963 | title = A new model for error clustering in telephone circuits | journal = IBM Journal of Research and Development | volume = 7 |issue=3 | pages = 224–236 | doi=10.1147/rd.73.0224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandelbrot described both the "Noah effect" (in which sudden discontinuous changes can occur) and the "Joseph effect" (in which persistence of a value can occur for a while, yet suddenly change afterwards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mandelbrot, B. |title=The Fractal Geometry of Nature |publisher=Freeman |location=New York |year=1977 |page=248 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: {{cite book |last1=Mandelbrot |first1=Benoît B. |last2=Hudson |first2=Richard L. |title=The (Mis)behavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin, and Reward |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=2004 |page=201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This challenged the idea that changes in price were [[normal distribution|normally distributed]]. In 1967, he published "[[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension|How long is the coast of Britain? Statistical self-similarity and fractional dimension]]", showing that a coastline's length varies with the scale of the measuring instrument, resembles itself at all scales, and is infinite in length for an [[infinitesimal]]ly small measuring device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mandelbrot |first=Benoît |title=How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension |journal=Science |volume=156 |issue=3775 |pages=636–8 |date=5 May 1967 |doi=10.1126/science.156.3775.636 |pmid=17837158 |bibcode = 1967Sci...156..636M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguing that a ball of twine appears as a point when viewed from far away (0-dimensional), a ball when viewed from fairly near (3-dimensional), or a curved strand (1-dimensional), he argued that the dimensions of an object are relative to the observer and may be fractional. An object whose irregularity is constant over different scales ("self-similarity") is a [[fractal]] (examples include the [[Menger sponge]], the [[Sierpiński gasket]], and the [[Koch curve]] or ''snowflake'', which is infinitely long yet encloses a finite space and has a [[fractal dimension]] of circa 1.2619). In 1982, Mandelbrot published ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]'', which became a classic of chaos theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mandelbrot, B.|title=The Fractal Geometry of Nature|date=1982|place=New York|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0716711865}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biological systems such as the branching of the circulatory and bronchial systems proved to fit a fractal model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Buldyrev |first1=S.V. |last2=Goldberger |first2=A.L. | last3=Havlin |first3=S. | authorlink3=Shlomo Havlin|last4=Peng |first4=C.K. | last5=Stanley | first5=H.E. |authorlink5=H.

In December 1977, the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] organized the first symposium on chaos, attended by David Ruelle, [[Robert May, Baron May of Oxford|Robert May]], [[James A. Yorke]] (coiner of the term "chaos" as used in mathematics), [[Robert Shaw (physicist)|Robert Shaw]], and the meteorologist Edward Lorenz. The following year, independently [[Pierre Coullet]] and [[Charles Tresser]] with the article "Iterations d'endomorphismes et groupe de renormalisation" and [[Mitchell Feigenbaum]] with the article "Quantitative Universality for a Class of Nonlinear Transformations" described logistic maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mitchell |last=Feigenbaum |title=Quantitative universality for a class of nonlinear transformations |journal=Journal of Statistical Physics |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=25–52 |date=July 1978 |doi=10.1007/BF01020332 |bibcode=1978JSP....19...25F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coullet, Pierre, and Charles Tresser. "Iterations d'endomorphismes et groupe de renormalisation." Le Journal de Physique Colloques 39.C5 (1978): C5-25&lt;/ref&gt;  They notably discovered the [[Universality (dynamical systems)|universality]] in chaos, permitting the application of chaos theory to many different phenomena.

In 1979, [[Albert J. Libchaber]], during a symposium organized in Aspen by [[Pierre Hohenberg]], presented his experimental observation of the [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] cascade that leads to chaos and turbulence in [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection]] systems. He was awarded the [[Wolf Prize in Physics]] in 1986 along with [[Mitchell J. Feigenbaum]] for their inspiring achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.wolffund.org.il/cat.asp?id=25&amp;cat_title=PHYSICS|title = The Wolf Prize in Physics in 1986.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the New York Academy of Sciences co-organized with the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] and the [[Office of Naval Research]] the first important conference on chaos in biology and medicine. There, [[Bernardo Huberman]] presented a mathematical model of the [[eye tracking disorder]] among [[schizophrenics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Bernardo Huberman |author=Huberman, B.A. |title=A Model for Dysfunctions in Smooth Pursuit Eye Movement |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=504 Perspectives in Biological Dynamics and Theoretical Medicine |pages=260–273 |date=July 1987 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb48737.x |bibcode = 1987NYASA.504..260H }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a renewal of [[physiology]] in the 1980s through the application of chaos theory, for example, in the study of pathological [[cardiac cycle]]s.

In 1987, [[Per Bak]], [[Chao Tang]] and [[Kurt Wiesenfeld]] published a paper in ''[[Physical Review Letters]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bak, Per; Tang, Chao; Wiesenfeld, Kurt |title=Self-organized criticality: An explanation of the 1/f noise |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=381–4 |date=27 July 1987 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.381 |bibcode=1987PhRvL..59..381B|last2=Tang |last3=Wiesenfeld }} However, the conclusions of this article have been subject to dispute. {{cite web|url=http://www.nslij-genetics.org/wli/1fnoise/1fnoise_square.html |title=? |work= |publisher= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214033929/https://www.nslij-genetics.org/wli/1fnoise/1fnoise_square.html |archivedate=2007-12-14 |df= }}. See especially: {{cite journal |author1=Laurson, Lasse |author2=Alava, Mikko J. |author3=Zapperi, Stefano |title=Letter: Power spectra of self-organized critical sand piles |journal=Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment |volume=0511 |id=L001 |date=15 September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; describing for the first time [[self-organized criticality]] (SOC), considered one of the mechanisms by which [[complexity]] arises in nature.

Alongside largely lab-based approaches such as the [[Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld sandpile]], many other investigations have focused on large-scale natural or social systems that are known (or suspected) to display [[scale invariance|scale-invariant]] behavior. Although these approaches were not always welcomed (at least initially) by specialists in the subjects examined, SOC has nevertheless become established as a strong candidate for explaining a number of natural phenomena, including [[earthquake]]s, (which, long before SOC was discovered, were known as a source of scale-invariant behavior such as the [[Gutenberg–Richter law]] describing the statistical distribution of earthquake sizes, and the [[Aftershock|Omori law]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Omori, F. |title=On the aftershocks of earthquakes |journal=Journal of the College of Science, Imperial University of Tokyo |volume=7 |pages=111–200 |year=1894 }}&lt;/ref&gt; describing the frequency of aftershocks), [[solar flare]]s, fluctuations in economic systems such as [[financial market]]s (references to SOC are common in [[econophysics]]), [[landscape formation]], [[forest fire]]s, [[landslide]]s, [[epidemic]]s, and [[biological evolution]] (where SOC has been invoked, for example, as the dynamical mechanism behind the theory of "[[punctuated equilibrium|punctuated equilibria]]" put forward by [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]]). Given the implications of a scale-free distribution of event sizes, some researchers have suggested that another phenomenon that should be considered an example of SOC is the occurrence of [[war]]s. These investigations of SOC have included both attempts at modelling (either developing new models or adapting existing ones to the specifics of a given natural system), and extensive data analysis to determine the existence and/or characteristics of natural scaling laws.

In the same year, [[James Gleick]] published ''[[Chaos: Making a New Science]]'', which became a best-seller and introduced the general principles of chaos theory as well as its history to the broad public, though his history under-emphasized important Soviet contributions.{{citation needed|reason=No reason given for soviet under-emphasis|date=May 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gleick|first=James|title=Chaos: Making a New Science|date=August 26, 2008|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0143113454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the domain of a few, isolated individuals, chaos theory progressively emerged as a transdisciplinary and institutional discipline, mainly under the name of [[nonlinear system]]s analysis. Alluding to [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s concept of a [[paradigm shift]] exposed in ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), many "chaologists" (as some described themselves) claimed that this new theory was an example of such a shift, a thesis upheld by Gleick.

The availability of cheaper, more powerful computers broadens the applicability of chaos theory. Currently, chaos theory remains an active area of research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Motter | first1 = A. E. | last2 = Campbell | first2 = D.

=== Cryptography ===
Chaos theory has been used for many years in [[cryptography]]. In the past few decades, chaos and nonlinear dynamics have been used in the design of hundreds of [[cryptographic primitive]]s. These algorithms include image [[encryption algorithms]], [[hash functions]], [[Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator|secure pseudo-random number generators]], [[stream ciphers]], [[Digital watermarking|watermarking]] and [[steganography]].&lt;ref name="Akhavan 1797–1813"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Akhavan|first=A.|last2=Samsudin|first2=A.|last3=Akhshani|first3=A.|date=2011-10-01|title=A symmetric image encryption scheme based on combination of nonlinear chaotic maps|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016003211001104|journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute|volume=348|issue=8|pages=1797–1813|doi=10.1016/j.jfranklin.2011.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these algorithms are based on uni-modal chaotic maps and a big portion of these algorithms use the control parameters and the initial condition of the chaotic maps as their keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behnia|first=S.|last2=Akhshani|first2=A.|last3=Mahmodi|first3=H.|last4=Akhavan|first4=A.|date=2008-01-01|title=A novel algorithm for image encryption based on mixture of chaotic maps|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077906004681|journal=Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals|volume=35|issue=2|pages=408–419|doi=10.1016/j.chaos.2006.05.011|bibcode = 2008CSF....35..408B }}&lt;/ref&gt; From a wider perspective, without loss of generality, the similarities between the chaotic maps and the cryptographic systems is the main motivation for the design of chaos based cryptographic algorithms.&lt;ref name="Akhavan 1797–1813"/&gt; One type of encryption, secret key or [[symmetric key]], relies on [[diffusion and confusion]], which is modeled well by chaos theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Xingyuan|year=2012|title=An improved key agreement protocol based on chaos|journal=Commun.

=== Robotics ===
Robotics is another area that has recently benefited from chaos theory. Instead of robots acting in a trial-and-error type of refinement to interact with their environment, chaos theory has been used to build a [[Predictive modelling|predictive model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nehmzow|first=Ulrich|date=Dec 2005|title=Quantitative description of robot–environment interaction using chaos theory|journal=Robotics and Autonomous Systems|volume=53|issue=3–4|pages=177–193|doi=10.1016/j.robot.2005.09.009|author2=Keith Walker|url=http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/udfn/ftp/ecmrw3.pdf|access-date=2017-10-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812003513/http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/udfn/ftp/ecmrw3.pdf|archive-date=2017-08-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chaotic dynamics have been exhibited by [[Passive dynamics|passive walking]] biped robots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goswami|first=Ambarish|year=1998|title=A Study of the Passive Gait of a Compass-Like Biped Robot: Symmetry and Chaos|journal=The International Journal of Robotics Research|volume=17|issue=12|pages=1282–1301|doi=10.1177/027836499801701202|author2=Thuilot, Benoit|author3=Espiau, Bernard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biology===
For over a hundred years, biologists have been keeping track of populations of different species with [[population model]]s. Most models are [[continuous function|continuous]], but recently scientists have been able to implement chaotic models in certain populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eduardo|first=Liz|author2=Ruiz-Herrera, Alfonso|title=Chaos in discrete structured population models|journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems|year=2012|volume=11|issue=4|pages=1200–1214|doi=10.1137/120868980}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a study on models of [[Canada lynx|Canadian lynx]] showed there was chaotic behavior in the population growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lai|first=Dejian|title=Comparison study of AR models on the Canadian lynx data: a close look at BDS statistic|journal=Computational Statistics \&amp; Data Analysis|year=1996|volume=22|issue=4|pages=409–423|doi=10.1016/0167-9473(95)00056-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaos can also be found in ecological systems, such as [[hydrology]]. While a chaotic model for hydrology has its shortcomings, there is still much to learn from looking at the data through the lens of chaos theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sivakumar|first=B|title=Chaos theory in hydrology: important issues and interpretations|journal=Journal of Hydrology|date=31 January 2000|volume=227|issue=1–4|pages=1–20|bibcode=2000JHyd..227....1S|doi=10.1016/S0022-1694(99)00186-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another biological application is found in [[cardiotocography]]. Fetal surveillance is a delicate balance of obtaining accurate information while being as noninvasive as possible. Better models of warning signs of [[Intrauterine hypoxia|fetal hypoxia]] can be obtained through chaotic modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bozóki|first=Zsolt|title=Chaos theory and power spectrum analysis in computerized cardiotocography|journal=European Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology and Reproductive Biology|date=February 1997|volume=71|issue=2|pages=163–168|doi=10.1016/s0301-2115(96)02628-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chemistry, predicting gas solubility is essential to manufacturing [[polymers]], but models using [[particle swarm optimization]] (PSO) tend to converge to the wrong points. An improved version of PSO has been created by introducing chaos, which keeps the simulations from getting stuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Mengshan|author2=Xingyuan Huanga|author3=Hesheng Liua|author4=Bingxiang Liub|author5=Yan Wub|author6=Aihua Xiongc|author7=Tianwen Dong|title=Prediction of gas solubility in polymers by back propagation artificial neural network based on self-adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm and chaos theory|journal=Fluid Phase Equilibria|date=25 October 2013|volume=356|pages=11–17|doi=10.1016/j.fluid.2013.07.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[celestial mechanics]], especially when observing asteroids, applying chaos theory leads to better predictions about when these objects will approach Earth and other planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morbidelli|first=A.|title=Chaotic diffusion in celestial mechanics|journal=Regular &amp; Chaotic Dynamics |year=2001|volume=6|issue=4|pages=339–353|doi=10.1070/rd2001v006n04abeh000182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four of the five [[moons of Pluto]] rotate chaotically.

Until recently, there was no reliable way to predict when they would occur.

Chaos theory can be applied outside of the natural sciences, but historically nearly all such studies have suffered from lack of reproducibility; poor external validity; and/or inattention to cross-validation, resulting in poor predictive accuracy (if out-of-sample prediction has even been attempted).

Researchers have continued to apply chaos theory to psychology. For example, in modeling group behavior in which heterogeneous members may behave as if sharing to different degrees what in [[Wilfred Bion]]'s theory is a  basic assumption, researchers have found that the group dynamic is the result of the individual dynamics of the members: each individual reproduces the group dynamics in a different scale, and the chaotic behavior of the group is reflected in each member.&lt;ref name="Dal FornoMerlone2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dal Forno | first1 = Arianna | last2 = Merlone | first2 = Ugo | title = Nonlinear dynamics in work groups with Bion's basic assumptions | journal = Nonlinear Dynamics, Psychology, and Life Sciences | volume = 17| issue=2 | year = 2013 | pages = 295–315 | issn = 1090-0578  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redington and Reidbord (1992) attempted to demonstrate that the human heart could display chaotic traits.  They monitored the changes in between-heartbeat intervals for a single psychotherapy patient as she moved through periods of varying emotional intensity during a therapy session.  Results were admittedly inconclusive.  Not only were there ambiguities in the various plots the authors produced to purportedly show evidence of chaotic dynamics (spectral analysis, phase trajectory, and autocorrelation plots), but when they attempted to compute a Lyapunov exponent as more definitive confirmation of chaotic behavior, the authors found they could not reliably do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Redington|first=D. J.|last2=Reidbord|first2=S. P.|title=Chaotic dynamics in autonomic nervous system activity of a patient during a psychotherapy session|journal=Biological Psychiatry|date=1992|volume=31|issue=10|pages=993–1007|pmid=1511082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 1995 paper, Metcalf and Allen  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Metcalf |first1= B. R. | last2 = Allen |first2= J. D. |editor1-first=F. D. |editor1-last= Abraham |editor2-first=A. R. | editor2-last=Gilgen |title= Chaos theory in psychology |publisher= Greenwood Press |year=1995 |chapter= In search of chaos in schedule-induced polydipsia }}&lt;/ref&gt; maintained that they uncovered in animal behavior a pattern of period doubling leading to chaos.  The authors examined a well-known response called schedule-induced polydipsia, by which an animal deprived of food for certain lengths of time will drink unusual amounts of water when the food is at last presented.  The control parameter (r) operating here was the length of the interval between feedings, once resumed.  The authors were careful to test a large number of animals and to include many replications, and they designed their experiment so as to rule out the likelihood that changes in response patterns were caused by different starting places for r.

Time series and first delay plots provide the best support for the claims made, showing a fairly clear march from periodicity to irregularity as the feeding times were increased.  The various phase trajectory plots and spectral analyses, on the other hand, do not match up well enough with the other graphs or with the overall theory to lead inexorably to a chaotic diagnosis.  For example, the phase trajectories do not show a definite progression towards greater and greater complexity (and away from periodicity); the process seems quite muddied.  Also, where Metcalf and Allen saw periods of two and six in their spectral plots, there is room for alternative interpretations.  All of this ambiguity necessitate some serpentine, post-hoc explanation to show that results fit a chaotic model.

By adapting a model of career counseling to include a chaotic interpretation of the relationship between employees and the job market, Aniundson and Bright found that better suggestions can be made to people struggling with career decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pryor|first=Robert G.

For instance, [[team building]] and [[group development]] is increasingly being researched as an inherently unpredictable system, as the uncertainty of different individuals meeting for the first time makes the trajectory of the team unknowable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Jamie|last2=Johnstone|first2=James|last3=Banks|first3=Curt|date=2018|title=An examination of initiation rituals in a UK sporting institution and the impact on group development|url=http://tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/16184742.2018.1439984|journal=European Sport Management Quarterly|pages=1–19|doi=10.1080/16184742.2018.1439984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some say the chaos metaphor—used in verbal theories—grounded on mathematical models and psychological aspects of human behavior
provides helpful insights to describing the complexity of small work groups, that go beyond the metaphor itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Dal Forno | first1 = Arianna | last2 = Merlone | first2 = Ugo |editor1-first=Gian Italo |editor1-last=Bischi  |editor2-first=Carl | editor2-last=Chiarella |editor3-first=Irina | editor3-last=Shusko |title=Global Analysis of Dynamic Models in Economics and Finance |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2013 |pages=185–204 |chapter= Chaotic Dynamics in Organization Theory |isbn= 978-3-642-29503-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It  is possible that economic models can also be improved through an application of chaos theory, but predicting the health of an economic system and what factors influence it most is an extremely complex task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Juárez|first=Fernando|title=Applying the theory of chaos and a complex model of health to establish relations among financial indicators|journal=Procedia Computer Science|year=2011|volume=3|pages=982–986|doi=10.1016/j.procs.2010.12.161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic and financial systems are fundamentally different from those in the classical natural sciences since the former are inherently stochastic in nature, as they result from the interactions of people, and thus pure deterministic models are unlikely to provide accurate representations of the data. The empirical literature that tests for chaos in economics and finance presents very mixed results, in part due to confusion between specific tests for chaos and more general tests for non-linear relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brooks |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Brooks (academic)|title=Chaos in foreign exchange markets: a sceptical view |journal=Computational Economics|year=1998 |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=265–281 |issn=1572-9974 |doi=10.1023/A:1008650024944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traffic forecasting may benefit from applications of chaos theory. Better predictions of when traffic will occur would allow measures to be taken to disperse it before it would have occurred. Combining chaos theory principles with a few other methods has led to a more accurate short-term prediction model (see the plot of the BML traffic model at right).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Jin|author2=Qixin Shi|title=Short-term traffic speed forecasting hybrid model based on Chaos–Wavelet Analysis-Support Vector Machine theory|journal=Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies|date=February 2013|volume=27|pages=219–232|doi=10.1016/j.trc.2012.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaos theory has been applied to environmental [[water cycle]] data (aka hydrological data), such as rainfall and streamflow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/research/projects/chaos-hydrology/|title=Dr. Gregory B. Pasternack – Watershed Hydrology, Geomorphology, and Ecohydraulics :: Chaos in Hydrology|website=pasternack.ucdavis.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These studies have yielded controversial results, because the methods for detecting a chaotic signature are often relatively subjective.  Early studies tended to "succeed" in finding chaos, whereas subsequent studies and meta-analyses called those studies into question and provided explanations for why these datasets are not likely to have low-dimension chaotic dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pasternack|first=Gregory B.|date=1999-11-01|title=Does the river run wild?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16537">A '''character''' (sometimes known as a '''fictional character''') is a [[person]] or other being in a [[narrative]] (such as a [[novel]], [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[television series]], [[film]], or [[video game]]).&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew Freeman|title=Historicising Transmedia Storytelling: Early Twentieth-Century Transmedia Story Worlds|isbn =1315439506|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2016|pages=31–34|accessdate=January 19, 2017 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDBuDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DiBattista"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria DiBattista|title=Novel Characters: A Genealogy|isbn =1444351559|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2011|pages=14–20|accessdate=January 19, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5uATBJUxMqEC&amp;pg=PT14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baldick (2001, 37) and Childs and Fowler (2006, 23). See also "character, 10b" in Trumble and Stevenson (2003, 381): "A person portrayed in a novel, a drama, etc; a part played by an actor".&lt;/ref&gt; The character may be entirely fictional or based on a real-life person, in which case the distinction of a "fictional" versus "real" character may be made.&lt;ref name="DiBattista"/&gt; Derived from the [[ancient Greek]] word χαρακτήρ, the English word dates from the [[English Restoration|Restoration]],&lt;ref&gt;''OED'' "character" sense 17.a citing, ''inter alia'', [[John Dryden|Dryden's]] 1679 preface to ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'': "The chief character or Hero in a Tragedy ... ought in prudence to be such a man, who has so much more in him of Virtue than of Vice... If Creon had been the chief character in ''Œdipus''..."&lt;/ref&gt; although it became widely used after its appearance in ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]''  in 1749.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 34), quotation: {{quotation|[...] is first used in English to denote 'a personality in a novel or a play' in 1749 (''The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', s.v.).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51/&gt; From this, the sense of "a part played by an [[actor]]" developed.&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51&gt;Harrison (1998, 51-2) quotation: {{quotation|Its use as 'the sum of the qualities which constitute an individual' is a mC17 development. The modern literary and theatrical sense of 'an individual created in a fictitious work' is not attested in OED until mC18: 'Whatever characters any... have for the jestsake personated... are now thrown off' (1749, Fielding, ''Tom Jones'').}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Character, particularly when enacted by an actor in the [[theatre]] or [[film|cinema]], involves "the illusion of being a human person".&lt;ref&gt;Pavis (1998, 47).&lt;/ref&gt; In literature, characters guide readers through their stories, helping them to understand plots and ponder themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Characters as Guides to Meaning | journal = The Reading Teacher | first = Nancy | last = Roser |author2=Miriam Martinez|author3=Charles Fuhrken|author4=Kathleen McDonnold | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 548–559| id = | accessdate = 2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of the 18th century, the phrase "in character" has been used to describe an effective [[impersonation]]  by an actor.&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51/&gt; Since the 19th century, the art of creating characters, as practiced by actors or writers, has been called [[characterisation]].&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51/&gt;

A character who stands as a representative of a particular [[Social class|class]] or group of people is known as a type.&lt;ref name=b265&gt;Baldick (2001, 265).&lt;/ref&gt; Types include both [[stock character]]s and those that are more fully [[individual]]ised.&lt;ref name=b265/&gt; The characters in [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' (1891) and [[August Strindberg]]'s ''[[Miss Julie]]'' (1888), for example, are representative of specific positions in the [[social relation]]s of class and [[gender]], such that the [[Conflict (narrative)|conflicts]] between the characters reveal [[Ideology|ideological]] conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 35).&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of a character requires an analysis of its relations with all of the other characters in the work.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 41).&lt;/ref&gt; The individual status of a character is defined through the network of oppositions (proairetic, [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]], [[Linguistics|linguistic]], [[Proxemics|proxemic]]) that it forms with the other characters.&lt;ref&gt;Elam (2002, 133).&lt;/ref&gt; The relation between characters and the action of the story shifts historically, often [[Mimesis|miming]] shifts in society and its ideas about human [[individual]]ity, [[self-determination]], and the [[social order]].&lt;ref&gt;Childs and Fowler (2006, 23).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}
In [[fiction writing]], authors create dynamic characters by many methods.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiBattista"/&gt; Sometimes characters are conjured up from imagination; in other instances, they are created by amplifying the character trait of a real person into a new fictional creation, or are created from scratch as a matter of expediency.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiBattista"/&gt;

==Types==

===Round vs. flat=== &lt;!-- Characterization links here. --&gt;
In his book ''Aspects of the Novel'', [[E. M. Forster]] defined two basic types of characters, their qualities, functions, and importance for the development of the novel: '''flat''' characters and '''round''' characters.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Michael J|author2=Patrick D. Murphy|title=Essentials of the theory of fiction|publisher=Duke University Press, 1996|edition=2|pages=36|isbn=978-0-8223-1823-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flat characters are two-dimensional, in that they are relatively uncomplicated. By contrast, round characters are complex figures with many different characteristics, that undergo development, sometimes sufficiently to surprise the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forster|first=E.M.|title=Aspects of the Novel|year=1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mary Sue]]s are characters mainly appearing in [[fan fiction]]. They are virtually devoid of flaws,&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Lucy Bennett, Paul Booth|title=Seeing Fans: Representations of Fandom in Media and Popular Culture|isbn =1501318470|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] USA|year=2016|page=160|accessdate=January 19, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ydwuDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are therefore considered flat characters.

===Dynamic vs. static===
'''Dynamic''' characters are those that change over the course of the story, while '''static''' characters remain the same throughout. An example of a popular static character in literature is [[Sherlock Holmes]]; an example of a dynamic character in literature is [[Ebenezer Scrooge]].

===Regular, recurring and guest characters===
In television, a regular, main or ongoing character is a character who appears in all or a majority of episodes, or in a significant chain of episodes of the series.&lt;ref&gt;The TV Writer's Workbook: A Creative Approach To Television Scripts [https://books.google.com/books?id=0YeCet_B_-IC&amp;pg=PA40 p. 40]&lt;/ref&gt; Regular characters may be both core and secondary ones. 

A [[recurring character]] often and frequently appears from time to time during the series' run.&lt;ref name="Crafty"&gt;{{cite book |last=Epstein |first=Alex |title=Crafty TV Writing: Thinking Inside the Box |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |year= 2006 |isbn=0-8050-8028-7 |pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recurring characters often play major roles in more than one episode, sometimes being the main focus.

A guest character is one which acts only in a few episodes or scenes. Unlike regular characters, the guest ones do not need to be carefully incorporated into the storyline with all its ramifications: they create a piece of drama and then disappear without consequences to the narrative structure, unlike core characters, for which any significant conflict must be traced during a considerable time, which is often seen as an unjustified waste of resources.&lt;ref&gt;Greg M. Smith, ''Beautiful TV: The Art and Argument of Ally McBeal'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=joaM7TvhSzUC&amp;pg=PA147 p. 147]&lt;/ref&gt; There may also be a continuing or recurring guest character.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, [https://books.google.com/books?id=joaM7TvhSzUC&amp;pg=PA151 p. 151]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a guest character may gain popularity and turn into a regular one.&lt;ref&gt;David Kukoff, ''Vault Guide to Television Writing Careers'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=T9zj0AqB6bUC&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical analysis==
{{further|Poetics (Aristotle)}}

In the earliest surviving work of [[dramatic theory]], ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE), the [[Greek philosophy|Classical Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] deduces that character (''[[ethos]]'') is one of six qualitative parts of [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[tragedy]] and one of the three objects that it [[Mimesis|represents]] (1450a12).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 8). Aristotle defines the six qualitative elements of tragedy as "plot, character, diction, reasoning, spectacle and song" (1450a10); the three objects are plot (''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]''), character (''[[ethos]]''), and reasoning (''[[dianoia]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; He understands character not to denote a fictional person, but the quality of the person acting in the story and reacting to its situations (1450a5).&lt;ref name=j984&gt;Janko (1987, 9, 84).&lt;/ref&gt; He defines character as "that which reveals [[Decision making|decision]], of whatever sort" (1450b8).&lt;ref name=j984/&gt; It is possible, therefore, to have stories that do not contain "characters" in Aristotle's sense of the word, since character necessarily involves making the [[Ethics|ethical]] dispositions of those performing the action clear.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle writes: "Again, without action a tragedy cannot exist, but without characters it may. For the tragedies of most recent [poets] lack character, and in general there are many such poets" (1450a24-25); see Janko (1987, 9, 86).&lt;/ref&gt; If, in speeches, the speaker "decides or avoids nothing at all", then those speeches "do not have character" (1450b9—11).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 9).&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle argues for the primacy of [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] (''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]'') over character (''[[ethos]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 34) and Janko (1987, 8).&lt;/ref&gt; He writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But the most important of these is the structure of the incidents. For (i) tragedy is a representation not of human beings but of action and life. Happiness and unhappiness lie in action, and the end [of life] is a sort of action, not a quality; people are of a certain sort according to their characters, but happy or the opposite according to their actions. So [the actors] do not act in order to represent the characters, but they include the characters for the sake of their actions" (1450a15-23).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 8).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Aristotle suggests that works were distinguished in the first instance according to the nature of the person who created them: "the grander people represented fine actions, i.e. those of fine persons" by producing "hymns and praise-poems", while "ordinary people represented those of inferior ones" by "composing invectives" (1448b20—1449a5).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 5). This distinction, Aristotle argues, arises from two causes that are natural and common to all humans—the delight taken in experiencing representations and the way in which we learn through imitation (1448b4—19); see Janko (1987, 4—5).&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, a distinction between the individuals represented in tragedy and in comedy arose: tragedy, along with [[epic poetry]], is "a representation of serious people" (1449b9—10), while [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] is "a representation of people who are rather inferior" (1449a32—33).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 6—7). Aristotle specifies that comedy does not represent all kinds of ugliness and vice, but only that which is laughable (1449a32—1449a37).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Tractatus coislinianus]]'' (which may or may not be by Aristotle), [[Ancient Greek comedy]] is defined as involving three types of characters: the [[buffoon]] (''[[bômolochus]]''), the [[Irony|ironist]] (''[[eirôn]]''), and the [[imposter]] or boaster (''[[alazôn]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 23) and Janko (1987, 45, 170).&lt;/ref&gt; All three are central to [[Aristophanes]]' "[[old comedy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 170).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] comic playwright [[Plautus]] wrote his plays two centuries later, the use of characters to define dramatic [[genre]]s was well established.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 22).&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Amphitryon (Plautus play)|Amphitryon]]'' begins with a [[prologue]] in which [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] claims that since the play contains kings and gods, it cannot be a comedy and must be a [[tragicomedy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Amphritruo'', line 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Political anthropology|expanded=Basic concepts}}A '''chiefdom''' is a form of hierarchical political organization in non-industrial societies usually based on [[kinship]], and in which formal leadership is monopolized by the legitimate senior members of select families or 'houses'. These elites form a political-ideological aristocracy relative to the general group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Helm|first1=Mary|title=Access to Origins: Affines, Ancestors, and Aristocrats|date=2010|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/access-to-origins-affines-ancestors-and-aristocrats/oclc/640095710&amp;referer=brief_results|oclc=640095710|publisher=Univ Of Texas Press|location=Austin, TX|isbn=9780292723740|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In [[anthropology|anthropological theory]], one model of human social development rooted in ideas of [[cultural evolution]] describes a chiefdom as a form of social organization more complex than a [[tribe]] or a [[band society]], and less complex than a [[State (polity)|state]] or a [[civilization]].

Within general theories of cultural evolution, chiefdoms are characterized by permanent and institutionalized forms of political leadership (the chief), centralized decision-making, economic interdependence, and social hierarchy.

Chiefdoms are described as intermediate between tribes and states in the progressive scheme of sociopolitical development formulated by [[Elman Service]]: ''band - tribe - chiefdom - state''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Service|first1=Elman R|title=Primitive Social Organization: An Evolutionary Perspective|date=1976|publisher=Random House|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=0394316355|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/primitive-social-organization-an-evolutionary-perspective/oclc/974107713&amp;referer=brief_results|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; A chief’s status is based on [[kinship]], so it is inherited or [[ascribed status|ascribed]], in contrast to the [[achieved status]] of [[Big man (anthropology)|Big Man]] leaders of tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sahlins|first1=Marshall D.|title=Poor Man, Rich Man, Big-man, Chief: Political Types in Melanesia and Polynesia|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|date=1963|volume=5|issue=3|pages=285–303|doi=10.1017/S0010417500001729|url=https://doi.org/10.1017/s0010417500001729|issn=1475-2999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another feature of chiefdoms is therefore pervasive social inequality. They are ranked societies, according to the scheme of progressive sociopolitical development formulated by [[Morton Fried]]: ''egalitarian - ranked - stratified - state''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fried|first1=Morton Herbert|title=The Evolution of Political Society: An Essay in Political Anthropology|date=1976|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0075535793|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/evolution-of-political-society-an-essay-in-political-anthropology/oclc/748982203&amp;referer=brief_results|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most succinct definition of a chiefdom in anthropology is by [[Robert L. Carneiro]]: "An autonomous political unit comprising a number of villages or communities under the permanent control of a paramount chief" (Carneiro 1981: 45).

=== Chiefdoms in archaeological theory ===
In [[archaeological theory]], Service's definition of chiefdoms as “redistributional societies with a permanent central agency of coordination” (Service 1962: 144) has been most influential. Many archaeologists, however, dispute Service's reliance upon redistribution as central to chiefdom societies, and point to differences in the basis of finance ([[staple finance]] v. [[wealth finance]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Earle|editor1-first=Timothy|title=Chiefdoms: Power, Economy, and Ideology|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|isbn=0521448018|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/chiefdoms-power-economy-and-ideology/oclc/611267761&amp;referer=brief_results|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Service argued that chief rose to assume a managerial status to redistribute agricultural surplus to ecologically specialised communities within this territory (staple finance). Yet in re-studying the Hawaiian chiefdoms used as his case study, [http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/earle.html Timothy Earle] observed that communities were rather self-sufficient. What the chief redistributed was not staple goods, but prestige goods to his followers that helped him to maintain his authority (wealth finance).

Some scholars contest the utility of the chiefdom model for archaeological inquiry. The most forceful critique comes from [[Timothy Pauketat]], whose ''Chiefdom and Other Archaeological Delusions''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pauketat|first1=Timothy R|title=Chiefdoms and Other Archaeological Delusions|date=2011|publisher=AltaMira Press|isbn=9780759108295|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/chiefdoms-and-other-archaeological-delusions/oclc/768479880&amp;referer=brief_results|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlines how chiefdoms fail to account for the high variability of the archaeological evidence for middle-range societies. Pauketat argues that the evolutionary underpinnings of the chiefdom model are weighed down by racist and outdated theoretical baggage that can be traced back to [[Lewis H. Morgan|Lewis Morgan]]'s 19th century cultural evolution. From this perspective, pre-state societies are treated as underdeveloped, the savage and barbaric phases that preceded civilization. Pauketat argues that the chiefdom type is a limiting category that should be abandoned, and takes as his main case study [[Cahokia]], a central place for the [[Mississippian culture]] of North America.

Pauketat's provocation, however, fails to offer a sound alternative to the chiefdom type. For while he claims that chiefdoms are a delusion, he describes Cahokia as a civilization. This upholds rather than challenges the evolutionary scheme he contests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beck|first=Robin|year=2009|title=On Delusions|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/371473/pdf|journal=Native South|volume=2|pages=111–120|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simple===
Chiefdoms are characterized by centralization of authority and pervasive inequality. At least two inherited [[social class]]es ([[elite]] and [[commoner]]) are present. (The [[Ancient Hawaii#Caste system|ancient Hawaiian chiefdoms]] had as many as four social classes.) An individual might change social class during a lifetime by extraordinary behavior.  A single lineage/family of the elite class becomes the ruling elite of the chiefdom, with the greatest influence, power, and prestige.  [[Kinship]] is typically an organizing principle, while marriage, age, and sex can affect one's social status and role.

A single simple chiefdom is generally composed of a central community surrounded by or near a number of smaller subsidiary communities.  All of the communities recognize the authority of a single kin group or individual with hereditary centralized power, dwelling in the primary community.  Each community will have its own leaders, which are usually in a [[tributary]] and/or subservient relationship to the ruling elite of the primary community.

===Complex===
A complex chiefdom is a group of simple chiefdoms controlled by a single paramount center, and ruled by a [[paramount chief]].  Complex chiefdoms have two or even three tiers of political [[hierarchy]].  Nobles are clearly distinct from commoners and do not usually engage in any form of agricultural production.  The higher members of society consume most of the goods that are passed up the hierarchy as a tribute.

Reciprocal obligations are fulfilled by the nobles carrying out ritual that only they can perform. They may also make token, symbolic redistributions of food and other goods. In two or three tiered chiefdoms, higher ranking chiefs have control over a number of lesser ranking individuals, each of whom controls specific territory or social units. Political control rests on the chief's ability to maintain access to a sufficiently large body of tribute, passed up the line by lesser chiefs.  These lesser chiefs in turn collect from those below them, from communities close to their own center.  At the apex of the status hierarchy sits the [[paramount chief|paramount]].

Anthropologists and [[archaeology|archaeologists]] have demonstrated through research that chiefdoms are a relatively unstable form of social organization. They are prone to [[Social cycle theory|cycles]] of collapse and renewal, in which tribal units band together, expand in power, fragment through some form of social stress, and band together again.  An example of this kind of social organization were the [[Germanic Peoples]] who conquered the western [[Roman Empire]] in the 5th century [[Common Era|CE]].  Although commonly referred to as tribes, anthropologists classified their society as chiefdoms.  They had a complex social hierarchy consisting of kings, a warrior aristocracy, common freemen, [[serfs]] and [[slaves]].

The American Indian tribes sometimes had ruling kings or satraps (governors) in some areas and regions. The Cherokee, for example, had an imperial-family ruling system over a long period of history. The early Spanish explorers in the Americas reported on the Indian kings and kept extensive notes during what is now called the conquest. Some of the native tribes in the Americas had princes, nobles, and various classes and castes. The "[[Natchez people|Great Sun]]" was somewhat like the Great Khans of Asia and eastern Europe. Much like an emperor, the Great Sun of North America is the best example of chiefdoms and imperial kings in North American Indian history. The Aztecs of Mexico had a similar culture.

==Chiefdoms on the Indian subcontinent==

The ''[[Arthashastra]]'', a work on politics written some time between the 4th century BC and 2nd century AD by [[India]]n author [[Kautilya]], similarly describes the [[Rajamandala]] (or "Raja-mandala,")  as circles of friendly and enemy states surrounding the state of a king (''[[raja]]'').&lt;ref name="avari-2007"&gt;{{cite book|first=Burjor|last=Avari|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y1e2V_4Um10C|title=India, the Ancient Past: A History of the Indian Sub-continent from C. 7000 BC to AD 1200|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|ISBN=0415356156|pages=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Prof. Mahendra Prasad|last=Singh|year=2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=80q_hd7ASdEC|title=Indian Political Thought: Themes and Thinkers|publisher=Pearson Education India|ISBN=8131758516|pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also see Suhas Chatterjee, ''Mizo Chiefs and the Chiefdom'' (1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mizo Chiefs and the Chiefdom|first=Suhas|last=Chatterjee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YON9iVgsDRUC|publisher=Publications Pvt. Ltd.|year=1995|ISBN=8185880727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Native Chieftain System in southern China==

[[Tusi]] ({{zh|{{linktext|土司}}}}), also known as Headmen or Chieftains, were tribal leaders recognized as imperial officials by the [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]], [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]], and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing-era]] Chinese governments, principally in [[Yunnan]]. The arrangement is generally known as the Native Chieftain System ({{zh|{{linktext|土司|制度}}}}, [[pinyin|p]] ''Tǔsī Zhìdù'').

== Alternatives to chiefdoms ==

In prehistoric South-West Asia, alternatives to chiefdoms were the non-hierarchical systems of complex [[Acephalous society|acephalous communities]], with a pronounced autonomy of single-family households.  These communities have been analyzed recently by Berezkin, who suggests the ''[[Apa Tanis]]'' as their ethnographic parallel (Berezkin 1995).  Frantsouzoff (2000) finds a more developed example of such type of polities in ancient South [[Arabia]] in the [[Wadi]] [[Hadhramawt]] of the 1st millennium [[BCE]].

In [[History of Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian history]] up to the early 19th century, the metaphysical view of the [[cosmos]] called the [[mandala]] (i.e., circle) is used to describe a [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|Southeast Asian political model]], which in turn describes the diffuse patterns of  political power distributed among [[Mueang]] (principalities) where circles of influence were more important than central power. The concept counteracts modern tendencies to look for unified political power like that of the large [[Europe]]an kingdoms and nation states, which were an inadvertent byproduct of 15th-century [[Cartography#Technological changes|advances in map-making technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Nikolay Kradin]] has demonstrated that an alternative to the state seems to be represented by the supercomplex chiefdoms created by some nomads of [[Eurasia]].  The number of structural levels within such chiefdoms appears to be equal, or even to exceed those within the average state, but they have a different type of political organization and political leadership.  Such types of political entities do not appear to have been created by the agriculturists (e.g., Kradin 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004).

{{Linguistics}}
'''Constraint-based grammars''' can perhaps be best understood in contrast to [[generative grammar]]s. A generative grammar lists all the transformations, merges, movements, and deletions that can result in all [[well-formedness|well-formed]] sentences, while constraint-based grammars, take the opposite approach, allowing anything that is not otherwise constrained. "The grammar is nothing but a set of constraints that structures are required to satisfy in order to be considered well-formed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollard|first1=Carl|title=The nature of constraint-based grammar|url=http://isli.khu.ac.kr/journal/content/data/15/1.pdf|website=11th Pacific Asian conference on language, information and computation}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A constraint-based grammar is more like a data base or a knowledge representation system than it is like a collection of algorithms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollard|first1=Carl|title=The nature of constraint-based grammar|url=http://isli.khu.ac.kr/journal/content/data/15/1.pdf|website=11th Pacific Asian conference on language, information and computation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9273">'''Continuing medical education''' ('''CME''') refers to a specific form of [[continuing education]] (CE) that helps those in the [[medicine|medical]] field maintain competence and learn about new and developing areas of their field. These activities may take place as live events, written publications, online programs, audio, video, or other electronic media. Content for these programs is developed, reviewed, and delivered by faculty who are experts in their individual clinical areas.  Similar to the process used in [[academic journals]], any potentially conflicting financial relationships for faculty members must be both disclosed and resolved in a meaningful way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accme.org/requirements/accreditation-requirements-cme-providers/standards-for-commercial-support|title=Standards for Commercial Support: Standards to Ensure Independence in CME Activities|publisher=Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education|accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics complain that drug and device manufacturers often use their financial sponsorship to bias CMEs towards marketing their own products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmeschedule.com/about-continuing-medical-education-cme/|title=Continuing Medical Education|publisher=CME Schedule|accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
Continuing medical education is not a new concept. From essentially the beginning of institutionalized medical instruction (medical instruction affiliated with medical colleges and teaching hospitals), health practitioners continued their learning by meeting with their peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ahmed K, Ashrafian H |title=Life-long learning for physicians |journal=Science |volume=326 |issue=5950 |page=227 |date=October 2009 |pmid=19815754 |doi=10.1126/science.326_227a |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19815754}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grand rounds, case discussions, and meetings to discuss published medical papers constituted the continuing learning experience. In the 1950s through to the 1980s, CME was increasingly funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Concerns regarding informational bias (both intentional and unintentional) led to increasing scrutiny of the CME funding sources. This led to the establishment of certifying agencies such as the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education which is an umbrella organization representing medical associations and bodies of academic medicine from the United States, Canada, Great Britain and Europe. The pharmaceutical industry has also developed guidelines regarding drug detailing and industry sponsorship of CME, such as the Pharmaceutical Advertising Advisory Board (PAAB) and Canada's Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies (Rx&amp;D).

== CME requirements ==
In the United States, many states require CME for medical professionals to maintain their licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Continuing Medical Education for Licensure Reregistration|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/455/licensurerereg-06.pdf|work=State Medical Licensure Requirements and Statistics|publisher=American Medical Association|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the United States, CME for physicians is regulated by the [[Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education]] (ACCME) and the [[American Osteopathic Association]] (AOA).

In Canada, certification is provided by the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada]] (RCPSC) and the [[College of Family Physicians Canada]] (CFPC).  The RCPSC is responsible for the development and implementation of all certifying examinations in each specialty other than Family Medicine. Specialist physicians who join the Royal College as Fellows maintain their knowledge, skills, competence and performance through participating in the Maintenance of Certification Program.  For each five-year cycle, fellows of the college are required to document 400 credits, with a minimum of 40 credits obtained in each year of the cycle.  Credits are earned at one to two credits per hour, based on the type of learning activity.  The CFPC requires 250 credit-hours over a five-year cycle.  Fifty credits must be obtained for each year of the cycle.  To earn and maintain fellowship within the college, an additional 24 credit-hours of higher level learning are also required over each learning cycle.  Similarly, each province and territory requires documentation of ongoing CME for licensure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ahmed K, Ashrafian H, Hanna GB, Darzi A, Athanasiou T |title=Assessment of specialists in cardiovascular practice |journal=Nature Reviews Cardiology  |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=659–67 |date=October 2009 |pmid=19724254 |doi=10.1038/nrcardio.2009.155 |url=http://www.nature.com/nrcardio/journal/v6/n10/pdf/nrcardio.2009.155.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production of CME courses==
Continuing medical education activities are developed and delivered by a variety of organizations, including:
* [[Professional association]]s
* [[Medical education agency|Medical education agencies]]
* [[Hospital]]s
* [[Educational institution]]s, including universities, medical and [[nursing school]]s
* [[Western Schools|Home study nursing continuing education providers]]

Activities may be classified as Formal Learning Activities, including live planned programs, enduring materials (such as DVD- and web-based content), Process Improvement CME (or PI-CME, as defined by the American Medical Association), or Informal Learning Activities such as Internet-Point of Care (POC) research and decision making, or [[journal club]]s whose members evaluate published research for mutual awareness and benefit, or online professional communities.&lt;ref&gt;Trentin G. (Ed) (2014). Network-Based Continuing Medical Education: Social Media and Professional Development. [[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]], Hauppauge, NY, {{ISBN|978-1-63117-346-2}}. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260311473_Network-Based_Continuing_Medical_Education_Social_Media_and_Professional_Development/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, professional certification for CME planners was established by the National Commission for Certification of CME Professionals which is earned by standardized exam, and confers the Certified CME Professional (CCMEP) certificate. NC-CME maintains a registry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nccme.org/content.aspx?dbid=12 |title=Welcome to www.nccme.org |publisher= National Commission for Certification of CME Professionals, Inc. |date= |accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; of these certified professionals. As of June 2011, the Registry included 320 professionals.

== Criticism of industry sponsorship{{anchor|sponsorship}}==

Critics, such as Morris and Taitsman,&lt;ref name="morris"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morris L, Taitsman JK |title=The agenda for continuing medical education—limiting industry's influence |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=361 |issue=25 |pages=2478–82 |date=December 2009 |pmid=20018969 |doi=10.1056/NEJMsb0905411 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/361/25/2478}}&lt;/ref&gt; would prefer that the medical profession eliminate commercial support for CME.

Despite ACCME requirements that program content be free of commercial interests, "CME providers can easily pitch topics designed to attract commercial sponsorship," and sponsors can award grants to programs that support their marketing strategies.&lt;ref name="morris"/&gt; The Institute of Medicine has said that CME has become too reliant on industry funding that "tends to promote a narrow focus on the products and to neglect provisions of a broader education on alternative strategies," such as communication and prevention.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Medicine, Conflict of interest in medical research, education, and practice. Washington, D.C., National Academies Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[gabapentin]] (Neurontin), was approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] for adjunctive therapy in epilepsy, but Warner-Lambert sponsored CME activities that encouraged its use for off-label indications. The [[U.S. Department of Justice]] brought civil and criminal charges against Warner-Lambert, which Warner-Lambert settled for $430 million, alleging that Warner-Lambert paid kickbacks to doctors in the form of lavish trips to attend presentations about [[off-label use]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2004/May/04_civ_322.htm Warner-Lambert to pay $430 million to resolve criminal &amp; civil health care liability relating to off-label promotion.] Press release of the U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC, May 13, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[AstraZeneca]] PLC has been fined $520 million in the [[United States]] for off-label promotion to doctors for their anti-psychotic drug, [[Seroquel]].

Industry-sponsored CMEs can violate federal statutes, according to the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]. "When a pharmaceutical manufacturer rewards high-prescribing physicians by directing a CME provider to pay (or overpay) them as CME faculty, consultants, or members of a speaker's bureau," wrote Morris and Taitsman.&lt;ref name="morris"/&gt;

The '''Council for Economic Education'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.councilforeconed.org/ CEE Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; (the new name, since 2009 January, of the National Council on Economic Education) is an organization in the United States that focuses on the economic and financial education of students from kindergarten through high school.&lt;ref name=BostonGlobeNov2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Buote|first=Brenda J.|title=Learning financial sense|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/regionals/north/2013/11/03/shawsheen-valley-technical-high-students-learn-abc-personal-finance|accessdate=24 December 2013|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=3 November 2013}}{{dead link|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission of the Council for Economic Education is to instill in young people the fourth “R”—a real-world understanding of [[economics]] and [[personal finance]]. It is only by acquiring economic and [[financial literacy]] that children can learn that there are better options for a life well lived, will be able to see opportunity on their horizon line and, ultimately, can grow into successful and productive adults capable of making informed and responsible decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.councilforeconed.org/about/ "About us" from the Council website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Headquartered in [[New York City]], CEE provides classroom resources to K-12 teachers and students, free professional development to educators, webinars, standards and assessment tools, and guidance for advocacy and outreach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.councilforeconed.org/about/ "About us" from Council website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign for Economic Literacy==
The Council for Economic Education is working on a campaign to increase economic literacy.

===Classroom Reach===
It was reported in 2013 that five million K-12 students annually used the Council for Economic Education's personal-finance and economics education.&lt;ref name=StarTribuneJune2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Bjorhus|first=Jennifer|title=Aggressive Hydraulics opens new headquarters in East Bethel, MN|url=http://www.startribune.com/business/211608851.html|accessdate=24 December 2013|newspaper=Star Tribune|date=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Council for Economic Education’s (CEE) Survey of the States===
The Council for Economic Education measures through a biennial survey financial literacy education across the United States by state.&lt;ref name=USATodayNov2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Malcolm|first=Hadley|title=Financial literacy education has real-life impact|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2013/11/13/financial-literacy-education-requirements/2953667/|accessdate=24 December 2013|newspaper=USA TODAY|date=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Economics Challenge===
The National Economics Challenge (NEC) is a high school economics competition. Each year, over 11,000 students across the U.S. participate in the competition. The Challenge recognizes exceptional high school students for their knowledge of economic principles and their ability to apply problem-solving and critical-thinking skills to real-world events. 

The National Economics Challenge is the only national competition of its kind, with students showcasing their knowledge of economics in a fun, challenging, and rewarding contest. The competition begins at the state level, with state champions advancing to the National Semi-Final round and the top performers subsequently advancing to the National Final round, which is held in New York City. Teams of four students answer rigorous questions on microeconomics, macroeconomics, international economics, and current events. At the National Final level, students complete rounds of multiple choice testing, work in teams to solve critical thinking case problems, and participate in a quick-paced oral quiz bowl in order to earn the title of National Economics Challenge Champions.

The National Economics Challenge offers a two-division contest format based on students’ economics coursework. The Adam Smith division is designed for students who are enrolled in Advanced Placement, international baccalaureate and honors economics courses. The David Ricardo division is fashioned for students who have received a general economics education, typically of one semester or less. The two-division system provides high school students of varying levels of economics practice with the chance to compete against their peers.

The Council for Economic Education sponsors the National Economics Challenge.

===Voluntary National Content Standards in Economics===

===National Content Standards in Personal Finance===
The Council for Economic Education released its National Content Standards in Personal Finance in March 2013 that are a personal finance course for high.&lt;ref name=CourierJournalMarch2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Gerwing|first=Maria|title=Teens need a financial education|newspaper=Courier-Journal (Louisville, Kentucky)|date=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Annual Financial Literacy and Economic Education Conference===
The Annual Conference is a nationwide meeting of K–12 educators, CEE affiliates from across the country, Federal Reserve partners, and other educators in this field. The conference features a selection of professional development workshops on economic and financial literacy geared for elementary, middle and high school levels. Topics include pedagogy and resources, curriculum strategy for schools/school districts, teaching strategies, assessment and research, new programs and best practices. In addition to the workshops, speakers address current economic and financial topics to enable educators to bring these perspectives back to their classrooms. The conference also features roundtable sessions led by master teachers to discuss shared issues and successes, and informal opportunities for networking.

Proponents of deep history argue for a definition of [[history]] that rests not upon the invention of [[writing]], but upon the evolution of [[anatomically modern humans]]. According to [[Daniel Lord Smail]], perhaps the most prominent advocate of Deep History, the concept of prehistory is recast as an arbitrary boundary that limits the ''[[longue durée]]'' perspective of historians, and which rests upon assumptions that history follows a teleological path beginning with the origins of [[civilization]] in [[Ancient Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Lord Smail, ''On Deep History and the Brain'' (University of California Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Smail suggests that advances in disciplines such as [[neurobiology]] and [[neurophysiology]] and [[genetics]] mean that there are more possibilities for understanding the distant past, and offer opportunities to explain how events such as biological evolution, global environmental change, and patterns of the spread of disease have affected humanity today.&lt;ref name=twsMedHistory&gt;Stephen T Casper (reviewer); Med Hist. 2009 Apr; 53(2): 318–319; {{PMC|2668893}}; [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2668893/ Book Reviews -- On deep history and the brain]; Review of book by: Daniel Lord Smail, ''On deep history and the brain'' published by Berkeley and London,  University of California Press,  2008, pp. xiv, 271, 978-0-520-25289-9, Accessed January 16, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents of Deep History generally do not acknowledge what they claim to be the traditional barrier between conventional history, generally based on written documentation such as ancient scrolls or hieroglyphs on pyramids, and unwritten prehistory, based on archaeology, in the human past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The History Manifesto|last = Guldi, Armitage|first = Jo, David|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-107-43243-7|location = Cambridge|pages = 86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of Smail's book by [[Steven Mithen]], professor of [[Archaeology]] at the [[University of Reading]], is sympathethic to some parts of his thesis, but says  "Smail may not be as closely acquainted with the ongoing debates in prehistoric archaeology as he might be", and on Smail's critical description of historians: "I have to take Smail’s word for it that such historians still exist, as after more than a century of prehistoric archaeology they would be an astonishing throwback to another age".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mithen, Steven|Steven Mithen]], [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v30/n02/steven-mithen/when-we-were-nicer "When We Were Nicer"], a review of ''On Deep History and the Brain'' by Daniel Lord Smail, ''[[London Review of Books]]'', Vol. 30 No. 2, 24 January 2008, pages 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Depyrogenation''' refers to the removal of pyrogens from solution, most commonly from injectable pharmaceuticals.

A [[wikt:pyrogen|pyrogen]] is defined as any substance that can cause a fever. Bacterial pyrogens include [[endotoxins]] and [[exotoxins]], although many pyrogens are endogenous to the host. Endotoxins include [[lipopolysaccharide]] (LPS) molecules found as part of the cell wall of [[Gram-negative]] bacteria, and are released upon bacterial cell [[lysis]]. Endotoxins may become pyrogenic when released into the bloodstream or other tissue where they are not usually found. Although the colon contains Gram-negative bacteria in abundance, they do not cause a pyrogenic effect as the bacteria are not undergoing gross lysis, and the immune system is not exposed to free endotoxin while the colonic wall is intact.

When LPS is released upon bacterial cell lysis, the lipid A component is first bound by serum LPS-Binding Protein (LBP) and then transferred to CD14 (either free CD14 in the serum or bound to the cell surface of macrophages or monocytes). This monomerises the aggregated LPS, as the LPS receptor Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) cannot recognise LPS while aggregated. Monomeric LPS is then transferred to MD-2 pre-complexed with TLR4 on [[macrophages]] and [[monocytes]]. This leads to release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide, which may lead ultimately to septic shock depending on the strength of response. Vascular [[endothelial]] cells also express TLR4 and MD-2 and so respond to LPS directly, as well as via cytokines and nitric oxide. Bronchial epithelial cells and colonic epithelial cells also express TLR4, but as they do not express MD-2 they rely on LPS precomplexed with serum MD-2 in order to signal to LPS.

== Maximum acceptable endotoxin level ==
Because endotoxin molecular weight may vary a great deal (10,000 to 1,000,000 Da), endotoxin levels are measured in "endotoxin units" (EU). One EU is approximately equivalent to 100 pg of E. coli lipopolysaccharide—the amount present in around 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; bacteria. Humans can develop symptoms when exposed to as little as 5 EU/kg body weight. These symptoms include, but are not limited to, fever, low blood pressure, increased heart rate, and low urine output; and even small doses of endotoxin in the blood stream are often fatal.

The [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] has set the following maximum permissible endotoxin levels for drugs distributed in the United States:
* Drug (injectable, [[intrathecal]]) - 0.2 EU/kg body weight
* Drug (injectable, non-intrathecal) - 5 EU/kg body weight
* Sterile water - 0.25-0.5 EU/ml (depends on intended use)

== Pyrogen detection ==

=== Rabbit Test ===
Early endotoxin detection was accomplished by injecting rabbits with the sample and observing the response in their body temperature. Rabbits have similar endotoxin tolerance to humans, and were thus an ideal choice. However, this method was costly, time consuming, and prompted protests from animals rights advocates. But perhaps the biggest drawback of this test was its inability to quantify the endotoxin level.

=== [[Limulus Amebocyte Lysate|LAL test]] ===
Currently, one common method for endotoxin detection is the [[Limulus Amebocyte Lysate]] (LAL) test. This test is based on Dr. Frederik Bang's [https://web.archive.org/web/20061010205452/http://commprojects.jhsph.edu/sphheros/default.cfm?detail=17] observation that horseshoe crab blood forms clots when exposed to endotoxins. Amoebocyte extract from horseshoe crab blood is mixed with a sample suspected of endotoxin contamination, and a reaction is observed if endotoxins are present. The FDA has approved four variations of the LAL test: gel-clot, turbidimetric, colorimetric, and chromogenic assay. The differences in these variations refer to the characteristics of the amoebocyte/endtoxin reaction (e.g. gel-clot produces a precipitate and colorimetric changes color). This test is fast (approx. 30 minutes) and highly sensitive (up to 0.001 EU/ml sensitivity). However, because it only detects LPS endotoxins, some pyrogenic materials can be missed. Also, certain conditions (sub-optimal pH conditions or unsuitable [[cation]] concentration) can lead to false negatives. [[Glucans]] from carbohydrate chromatography matrices can also lead to false positives.

Since 2003, a synthetic substitute for the LAL test has been commercially available. It is based on the [[Limulus clotting factor C]] protein, produced by genetically modified insect gut cells. The adoption of this test was slow, which began to change in 2016 when the [[European Pharmacopoeia|European Pharmacopeia]] listed this test as an accepted bacterial-toxin test.

=== Monocyte Activation Test ===
The [[Monocyte Activation Test]] (MAT) uses the [[monocyte]]s in human blood ''[[in vitro]]'' to detect pyrogens. It was added to the European Pharmacopeia in 2010 and accepted by the FDA in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/guidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM310098.pdf Guidance for Industry Pyrogen and Endotoxins Testing: Questions and Answers], FDA, June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pyrogen removal (depyrogenation) ==
Pyrogens can often be difficult to remove from solution due to the high variability of their molecular weight. Pyrogens are also relatively thermally stable and insensitive to pH changes. However, several removal techniques exist [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282704534_A_Practical_Approach_to_Depyrogenation_Studies_Using_Bacterial_Endotoxin].

'''[[Ion exchange chromatography]]'''

Endotoxins are negatively charged, and will bind to an ''[[anion exchanger]]''. If the target substance is not also negatively charged, it will pass through the column before the endotoxin, and an effective separation can be achieved. This method is sometimes used in the purification of [[albumins]] (details follow). [[Ligands]] of known affinity to endotoxins can be coupled to an anion exchange system to increase its endotoxin binding strength and further improve the purity of the final product. Typical examples of endotoxin binding ligands include [[histamine]], nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, and [[polymyxin B]]. However, [[polymyxin B]] is known to induce production of interleukin-1, an exogenous pyrogen, and thus must be shown to be absent in the final product if used.

Example of using [[anion exchange chromatography]] to purify albumin (Uppsala):
* 2% of the endotoxin ''does not'' bind to the column. However, this 2% washes out before the albumin peak, and can thus be removed simply by starting collection after this 2% has washed out.
* 10% of the endotoxin that ''does'' bind to the column (9.8% of the original total) will eventually wash out after the albumin peak. This can be prevented from entering the final product by stopping collection before this happens.
* The remaining 90% of the bound endotoxin (88.2% of the original total) must be cleaned off the column using NaOH

An alternative to anion exchange is ''[[cation exchange]] chromatography'', in which positively charged solutes bind to the solid chromatographic media. In this method, the target binds to the column instead of the endotoxin. The endotoxin then washes through the column, and a pure target is later eluted off the column. Cation exchange chromatography has been shown to effectively purify β-interferon. (Dembinski, et al.)

'''[[Ultrafiltration]]'''

Because the molecular weight of endotoxins is usually over 10 kD, ultrafiltration can sometimes be used to perform as a size based separation. Due to the high variability of endotoxin size, it can be difficult to select the correct membrane, hence this method is best used only when all endotoxins present are larger than 300,000 Da. Commercially available ultra filters have been shown to remove pyrogens to a level below 0.001 EU/ml.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

'''[[Distillation]]'''

This method is also based on the large molecular weight and heat stability of endotoxins. Low molecular-weight solvents can be easily purified by boiling and collecting the condensed vapor in an endotoxin free vessel (see "heating" below). The large LPS molecules do not easily vaporize, and are thus left behind in the heating vessel. This is the method of choice for the purification of water.

== Inactivation/destruction ==
Because pyrogens are often difficult to remove, inactivation or destruction of the LPS molecule can sometimes be preferable.

'''Acid-base [[hydrolysis]]''' 
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Endo3.jpeg|right]] --&gt;
This method has been shown to cleave Lipid A from the polysaccharide in the LPS molecule (see right). The [[lipid]] moiety alone is not soluble in water. Thus unable to bind to [[endothelial]] cells, it is rendered inactive. However, acid-base hydrolysis can denature a target protein, and is thus unsuitable when purifying a protein.

'''[[Oxidation]]'''

Oxidation using hydrogen peroxide is often used as a low cost pyrogen destroying solution. The mechanism for this destruction is unknown, but hydrogen peroxide can easily be removed further downstream in the purification process, and is therefore a useful method of pyrogen removal. However, like acid-base hydrolysis, it is not suitable when purifying proteins.

'''Heating'''

Heating methods are often used to ensure that glass and other lab equipment are free of pyrogenic material. Heat is applied by baking in a dry heat oven that is designed specifically for the depyrogenation process. Although endotoxins are relatively thermally stable, sufficient heating (250&amp;nbsp;°C for 30 min) results in a [[Log reduction|3-log reduction]] of endotoxin levels. Due to the high temperature levels, this method is also not suitable when purifying proteins.

'''Sodium Hydroxide'''

When purifying proteins, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) can be used safely and effectively. It is also widely used for depyrogenation of non-autoclavable equipment (e.g. plastics) and chromatography columns. In fact, when using an anion exchanger to remove pyrogens, it is necessary to clean the column with NaOH after each batch.

== Preventive methods ==
Because virtually all raw materials involved in a production process, including factory employees, can be potential sources of pyrogen contamination, raw material screening and depyrogenation can often go a long way to ensuring the final product is free of pyrogens and does not require costly removal or inactivation methods. Ultrafiltration of chemicals and buffer solutions, applying appropriate hygienic practices, and performing regular tests can all be helpful.

{{Contains Tibetan text}}
'''Dzong architecture''' is a distinctive type of fortress ({{bo|w=rdzong}}, {{IPA-all|tz&lt;sup&gt;ɦ&lt;/sup&gt;oŋ˩˨}}) [[architectural style|architecture]] found mainly in [[Bhutan]] and [[Tibet]]. The architecture is massive in style with towering exterior walls surrounding a complex of [[courtyard]]s, temples, administrative offices, and monks' accommodation.

==Characteristics==
Distinctive features include:
* High inward sloping walls of brick and stone painted white with few or no windows in the lower sections of the wall
* Use of a surrounding red ochre stripe near the top of the walls, sometimes punctuated by large gold circles.
* Use of unique style flared roofs atop interior temples.
* Massive entry doors made of wood and iron
* Interior courtyards and temples brightly colored in Buddhist-themed art [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] such as the [[ashtamangala]] or [[swastika]], for example.

==Regional differences==

===Bhutan===
{{See also|History of Bhutan}}
Dzongs serve as the religious, military, administrative, and social centers of their district. They are often the site of an annual ''[[tsechu]]'' or religious festival.

The rooms inside the dzong are typically allocated half to administrative function (such as the office of the ''[[penlop]]'' or governor), and half to religious function, primarily the temple and housing for monks. This division between administrative and religious functions reflects the idealized [[dual system of government|duality of power]] between the religious and administrative branches of government.

===Tibet===
{{Further|List of administrative divisions of the Tibet Autonomous Region}}
Tibet used to be divided into 53 prefecture districts also called ''dzongs''.&lt;ref name=Tibet&gt;''Le Tibet'', Marc Moniez, Christian Deweirdt, Monique Masse, Éditions de l'Adret, Paris, 1999, {{ISBN|2-907629-46-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were two [[dzongpen|dzongpöns]] for each dzong, a [[lama]] and a layman. They were entrusted with both civil and military powers and are equal in all respects, though subordinate to the generals and the Chinese [[amban]] in military matters,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarat Chandra Das|Das, Sarat Chandra]]. (1902). ''Lhasa and Central Tibet''. Reprint (1988): Mehra Offset Press, Delhi, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; until the expulsion of the ambans following the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1912.&lt;ref name=Tibet/&gt; Today, 71 [[List of administrative divisions of the Tibet Autonomous Region|counties]] in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] are called ''dzong''s in the [[Tibetic languages]].

==Siting of dzongs==
[[Image:TrongsaDzong.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Trongsa Dzong]], the largest dzong fortress in [[Bhutan]].]]
Bhutanese dzong architecture reached its zenith in the 17th century under the leadership of [[Ngawang Namgyal]], the 1st [[Zhabdrung Rinpoche]]. The Zhabdrung relied on visions and omens to site each of the dzongs. Modern military strategists would observe that the dzongs are well-sited with regard to their function as defensive fortresses. [[Wangdue Phodrang]] dzong, for instance, is set upon a spur overlooking the confluence of the [[Sankosh River|Sankosh]] (Puna Tsang) and [[Tang Chuu|Tang]] Rivers, thus blocking any attacks by southern invaders who attempted to use a river route to bypass the trackless slopes of the middle Himalayas in attacking central Bhutan. [[Drukgyel]] Dzong at the head of the [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]] valley guards the traditional [[Tibet]]an invasion path over the passes of the high Himalayas.
[[Image:Wangdue Phodrang Dzong.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Dzong at [[Wangdue Phodrang]], Bhutan.]]
Dzongs were frequently built on a hilltop or mountain spur. If the dzong is built on the side of a valley wall, a smaller dzong or watchtower is typically built directly uphill from the main dzong with the purpose of keeping the slope clear of attackers who might otherwise shoot downward into the courtyard of the main dzong below (see image at head of article).

[[Punakha Dzong]] is distinctive in that it is sited on a relatively flat spit of land at the confluence of the [[Mo Chhu|Mo]] and [[Pho Chhu|Pho]] Rivers. The rivers surround the dzong on three sides, providing protection from attack. This siting proved inauspicious, however, when in 1994 a glacial lake 90 kilometers upstream burst through its [[Ice jam|ice dam]] to cause a massive flood on the Pho Chhu, damaging the dzong and taking 23 lives.

==Construction==
[[Image:Bhutan architecture dzong roof.jpg|thumb|upright|Roof construction at Tongsa dzong.]]
By tradition, dzongs are constructed without the use of architectural plans. Instead construction proceeds under the direction of a high [[lama]] who establishes each dimension by means of spiritual inspiration.

In previous times the dzongs were built using [[corvée]] labor which was applied as a tax against each household in the district. Under this obligation each family was to provide or hire a decreed number of workers to work for several months at a time (during quiet periods in the agricultural year) in the construction of the dzong.

Dzongs comprise heavy [[masonry]] curtain walls surrounding one or more courtyards. The main functional spaces are usually arranged in two separate areas: the administrative offices; and the religious functions - including temples and monks' accommodation. This accommodation is arranged along the inside of the outer walls and often as a separate stone tower located centrally within the courtyard, housing the main temple, that can be used as an inner defensible citadel. The main internal structures are again built with stone (or as in domestic architecture by rammed clay blocks), and whitewashed inside and out, with a broad red [[ochre]] band at the top on the outside. The larger spaces such as the temple have massive internal timber columns and beams to create galleries around an open central full height area. Smaller structures are of elaborately carved and painted timber construction.

The roofs are massively constructed in [[hardwood]] and [[bamboo]], highly decorated at the [[eaves]], and are constructed traditionally without the use of nails. They are open at the eaves to provide a ventilated storage area. They were traditionally finished with timber [[Roof shingle|shingle]]s weighted down with stones; but in almost all cases this has now been replaced with [[corrugated galvanised iron]] roofing. The roof of Tongsa Dzong, illustrated, is one of the few shingle roofs to survive and was being restored in 2006/7.

The courtyards, usually stone-flagged, are generally at a higher level than the outside and approached by massive staircases and narrow defensible entrances with large wooden doors. All doors have thresholds to discourage the entrance of spirits. Temples are usually set at a level above the courtyard with further staircases up to them.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Modern architecture in the dzong style==
Larger modern buildings in Bhutan often use the form and many of the external characteristics of dzong architecture in their construction, although incorporating modern techniques such as a concrete frame.

===University of Texas at El Paso===
The campus architecture of the [[University of Texas at El Paso]] (UTEP) is a rare example of dzong style seen outside the Himalayas. Initial phases were designed by El Paso architect [[Trost &amp; Trost|Henry Trost]], and later phases have continued in the same style.&lt;ref&gt;For more details see the ''[http://admin.utep.edu/Default.aspx?PageContentMode=1&amp;tabid=30289 UTEP Handbook of Operations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210043029/http://admin.utep.edu/Default.aspx?PageContentMode=1&amp;tabid=30289 |date=2012-02-10 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

==UNESCO Tentative Listing==
In 2012, the Butanese government listed five dzongs to its tentative list for [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] inscription in the future. The five dzongs are Punakha Dzong, Wangdue Phodrang Dzong, Paro Dzong, Trongsa Dzong and Dagana Dzong.&lt;ref&gt;https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5695/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Entomology''' ({{ety|grc|''ἔντομον'' (entomon)|insect||''-λογία'' ([[wikt:-logia|-logia]])|study of}}&lt;ref name="Liddell 1980"&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Henry George Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] | year = 1980 | title = [[A Greek-English Lexicon]] (Abridged Edition) | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = United Kingdom | isbn = 0-19-910207-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the [[science|scientific]] study of [[insect]]s, a branch of [[zoology]]. In the past the term "insect" was more vague, and historically the definition of entomology included the study of terrestrial [[animal]]s in other [[arthropod]] groups or other [[phylum|phyla]], such as [[arachnid]]s, [[myriapod]]s, [[earthworm]]s, [[land snail]]s, and [[slug]]s. This wider meaning may still be encountered in informal use.

Like several of the other fields that are categorized within [[zoology]], entomology is a [[taxon]]-based category; any form of scientific study in which there is a focus on insect-related inquiries is, by definition, entomology. Entomology therefore overlaps with a cross-section of topics as diverse as [[molecular genetics]], [[behavior]], [[biomechanics]], [[biochemistry]], [[systematics]], [[physiology]], [[developmental biology]], [[ecology]], [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], and [[paleontology]].

At some 1.3 million described [[species]], insects account for more than two-thirds of all known organisms,&lt;ref name="Chapman"&gt;{{cite book |author=Chapman, A.

{{See also|Timeline of entomology}}

Entomology is rooted in nearly all human [[culture]]s from [[prehistoric]] times, primarily in the context of [[agriculture]] (especially [[biological control]] and [[beekeeping]]), but [[scientific]] study began only as recently as the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Saltini, ''Storia delle scienze agrarie'', 4 vols, Bologna 1984-89, {{ISBN|88-206-2412-5}}, {{ISBN|88-206-2413-3}}, {{ISBN|88-206-2414-1}}, {{ISBN|88-206-2415-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Kirby (entomologist)|William Kirby]] is widely considered as the father of Entomology. In collaboration with [[William Spence (entomologist)|William Spence]], he published a definitive entomological encyclopedia, ''Introduction to Entomology'', regarded as the subject's foundational text. He also helped to found the [[Royal Entomological Society]] in London in 1833, one of the earliest such societies in the world; earlier antecedents, such as the [[Aurelian (entomology)|Aurelian society]] date back to the 1740s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bq05ecMx-owC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27|title=Bugs and the Victorians|publisher=Yale University Press|author=Clark, John F.M.|year=2009|pages=26–27|isbn=0300150911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entomology developed rapidly in the 19th and 20th centuries, and was studied by large numbers of people, including such notable figures as [[Charles Darwin]], [[Jean-Henri Fabre]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Karl von Frisch]] (winner of the 1973 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1973/frisch-lecture.html|title=Karl von Frisch - Nobel Lecture: Decoding the Language of the Bee|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two-time [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[E. O. Wilson]].

There has also been a history of people becoming entomologists through museum curation and research assistance,&lt;ref name="Starrs NMNH"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Starrs|first1=Siobhan|title=A Scientist and a Tinkerer – A Story in a Frame|url=http://nmnh.typepad.com/100years/2010/08/a-scientist-and-a-tinkerer-a-story-in-a-frame.html|website=National Museum of Natural History Unearthed|publisher=National Museum of Natural History|accessdate=19 March 2017|date=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Sophie Lutterlough]] at the Smithsonian [[National Museum of Natural History]]. Insect identification is an increasingly common hobby, with [[butterfly|butterflies]] and [[dragonfly|dragonflies]] being the most popular.

Most insects can easily be recognized to order such as Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and ants) or Coleoptera (beetles).  However, insects other than [[Lepidoptera]] ([[butterflies]] and [[moth]]s) are typically identifiable to genus or species only through the use of [[Identification key]]s and [[Monograph]]s. Because the class [[Insecta]] contains a very large number of species (over 330,000 [[species]] of [[beetles]] alone) and the characteristics separating them are unfamiliar, and often subtle (or invisible without a [[microscope]]), this is often very difficult even for a specialist. This has led to the development of [[automated species identification]] systems targeted on insects, for example, [[Digital Automated Identification SYstem (DAISY)|Daisy]], ABIS, SPIDA and Draw-wing.

==In pest control==
In 1994, the Entomological Society of America launched a new [[professional certification]] program for the pest control industry called the Associate Certified Entomologist (ACE). To qualify as a "true entomologist" an individual would normally require an advanced degree, with most entomologists pursuing their PhD. While not true entomologists in the traditional sense, individuals who attain the ACE certification may be referred to as ACEs, Amateur Entomologists, or Associate Entomologists.

==Taxonomic specialization==
[[Image:Beetle collection.jpg|thumb|Part of a large [[beetle]] collection.]]

Many entomologists specialize in a single order or even a family of insects, and a number of these subspecialties are given their own informal names, typically (but not always) derived from the scientific name of the group:
* [[Coleopterology]] - [[beetle]]s
* [[Dipterology]] - [[flies]]
* [[Odonata|Odonatology]] - [[Odonata|dragonflies and damselflies]]
* [[Hemiptera|Hemipterology]] - [[Hemiptera|true bugs]]
* [[Isoptera|Isopterology]] - [[termite]]s
* [[Lepidoptera|Lepidopterology]] - [[moth]]s and [[butterfly|butterflies]]
* [[Melittology]] (or ''Apiology'') - [[bee]]s
* [[Myrmecology]] - [[ant]]s
* [[Orthopterology]] - [[grasshopper]]s, [[cricket (insect)|crickets]], etc.
* [[Trichoptera|Trichopterology]] - [[caddis flies]]
* [[Vespology]] - Social [[wasps]]

==Organizations==
Like other scientific specialties, entomologists have a number of local, national, and international organizations. There are also many organizations specializing in specific subareas.
* [[Amateur Entomologists' Society]]
* [[Deutsches Entomologisches Institut]]
* [[Entomological Society of America]]

'''Exoteric''' refers to knowledge that is outside, and independent from, a person's experience and can be ascertained by anyone (related to [[common sense]]). The word is derived from the comparative form of [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἔξω ''eksô'', "from, out of, outside". It signifies anything which is public, without limits, or [[universalism|universal]]. It is distinguished from internal [[esoteric]] knowledge. "Exoteric" relates to external reality as opposed to a person's thoughts or feelings. It is knowledge that is public as opposed to [[secret]] or [[cabal]]istic.  It is not required that exoteric knowledge come easily or automatically, but it should be referenceable or reproducible.

== Philosophical context ==
Most philosophical and religious belief systems presume that reality must be independent of what an individual makes of it. However, even before the days of [[Plato]], a prominent alternate [[theory of knowledge]] insisted that the perceived outside reality is merely an internal fabrication of the observer and that it has no existence or substance outside the imagination of the observer. The Buddha's statement: "All that we are arises with our thoughts"  ([[Dhammapada]] 1.1) is reminiscent of this.

In his book entitled ''[[The Book of Five Rings]]'', the Japanese swordsmaster [[Miyamoto Musashi]] noted that when he teaches people martial arts, "since [he] generally makes them learn such things as have actual relevance to addressing [deeper principles], there is no such thing as a distinction between the esoteric and the exoteric." &lt;ref&gt;Miyamoto Musashi. ''The Book of Five Rings.'' Translated by Thomas Cleary. Shambhala Library. Boston &amp; London. 2003. p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious context ==
In the same way as the term "esoteric" is often associated with [[esotericism|esoteric spirituality]], the term "exoteric" is mostly used in discussions of religion and spirituality, as when the teachings shift the believer's focus away from an exploration of the inner self and towards an adherence to rules, laws, and an individual God.

The term "exoteric" may also reflect the notion of a divine identity that is outside of, and different from, human identity, whereas the esoteric notion claims that the divine is to be discovered ''within'' the human identity. Going one step further, the pantheistic notion suggests that the divine and the material world are one and the same.

==Government==
The exoteric form of government is one where all actions taken by the government must be both publicly disclosed and ratified by the public. This is often referred to as [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]] of governance.

==Societies==
Many societies are divided into 2 sections—the ''exoteric'' or "public face" and the ''esoteric'' or "behind closed doors". Such are many [[fraternal organization]]s, such as [[Freemasonry]], which are at some level accessible to the uninitiated but which have higher and higher levels of initiation as one progresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cavron|first1=John T. Mathews,|title=The True Freemasonry: Exoteric and Esoteric|url=http://www.masonicworld.com/education/articles/THE-TRUE-FREEMASONRY-EXOTERIC-AND-ESOTERIC.htm|website=www.masonicworld.com|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fair Trade coffee''' is [[coffee]] that is certified as having been produced to [[fair trade]] standards.

[[Fair trade]] organizations create trading partnerships that are based on dialogue, [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and [[respect]], that seeks greater equity in [[international trade]]. These partnerships contribute to sustainable development by offering better trading conditions to [[coffee bean]] farmers.

Fair trade organizations are engaged actively in supporting producers and sustainable environmental farming practices. Fair trade practices prohibit child or forced labor.

==History==
[[File:Coffee beans being sorted and pulped.jpg|thumb|Fair trade [[coffee bean]]s being sorted]]
Prior to fair trade, prices were regulated by the [[International Coffee Organization]] according to the regulations set forth by the [[International Coffee Agreement]] of 1962. The agreement, which was negotiated at the [[United Nations]] by the Coffee Study Group, set limits on the amount of coffee traded between countries so there would be no excess supply and consequent drop in price. The ICA existed for five years, and then was renewed in 1968.

The agreement was renegotiated in 1976 due to increasing coffee prices, largely a result of a severe frost in [[Brazil]]. The new agreement allowed for the suspension of price quotas if the supply of coffee could not meet the demand, and enabling them if prices dropped too low.

In 1984, the agreement was again redrawn, this time creating a database on coffee trade, and implementing stricter import and export regulations.

[[Fair trade certification]] was then introduced in 1988 following a coffee crisis in which the supply of coffee was greater than the demand; since no price quotas had been reimplemented by the International Coffee Act, the market was flooded. Launched in the [[Netherlands]], fair trade certification aimed to artificially raise coffee prices in order to ensure growers sufficient wages to turn a profit. The original name of the organization was "[[Max Havelaar]]", after a fictional Dutch character who opposed the exploitation of coffee farmers by Dutch colonialists in the East Indies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|title=HOW DID IT ACTUALLY START?|url=http://www.maxhavelaar.nl/faq/how-did-it-start?destination=english&amp;backtitle=FAQ%27s|work=FairTrade Max Havelaar Netherlands|publisher=Max Havelaar Foundation|accessdate=5 August 2012|author=Max Havelaar Foundation|language=Dutch, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization created a label for products that met certain wage standards.

Quotas remained a part of the agreement until 1989, when the organization was unable to negotiate a new agreement in time for the next year. It was decided that the 1983 agreement would be extended, but without the quotas because they had not yet been determined. A new agreement could not be negotiated until 1992.

From 1990 to 1992, without the quotas in place, coffee prices reached an all-time low because coffee price quotas could not be decided.

The agreements of 2001 and 2007 aimed to stabilize the coffee economy by promoting coffee consumption, raising the standard of living of growers by providing economic counselling, expanding research to include [[niche markets]] and quality relating to geographic area, and conducting studies of [[sustainability]], principles similar to fair trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of The International Coffee Organization|url=http://www.ico.org/icohistory_e.asp|publisher=International Coffee Organization|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite web |title=CERTIFICATION &amp; YOUR BUSINESS|url=http://www.fairtradeusa.org/certification|work=Fair Trade USA|publisher=Fair Trade USA|accessdate=5 August 2012|author=Fair Trade USA|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the inception of fair trade certification, the "Transfair" label was later launched in Germany, and within ten years three other labeling organizations commenced: The [[Fairtrade Foundation]], [[TransFair USA]], and [[Rättvisemärkt]]. In 1997, these four organizations jointly created Fairtrade International (formerly called FLO, or [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]]), which continues to set Fairtrade standards, inspecting and certifying growers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The fair trade labeling organizations having most of the market share and who sell through supermarkets refer to a definition developed by [[FINE]], an association of four international fair trade networks ([[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]], [[World Fair Trade Organization]] (WFTO), [[Network of European World shops]] and [[European Fair Trade Association]] (EFTA)). The standards developed by Fairtrade Labelling Organization are the most widely used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trade Standard|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/standards.html|publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Certification scheme ==

The certification scheme is run by [[FLO International|Fairtrade International (FLO)]].

Coffee packers pay Fairtrade a fee for the right to use the Fairtrade logo, which gives consumers an assurance that the coffee meets Fairtrade criteria. The coffee with this certification mark must be produced by farmers and cooperatives that meet these criteria.&lt;ref name="fairtrade.net"&gt;Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V. (2011) “Generic Fairtrade Trade Standard,” p11  {{cite web |url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502051837/http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-02 |df= }}  accessed 15/1/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coffee retailers ==
Coffee retailers are not restricted by Fairtrade to sell Fairtrade coffee as a premium product and charge as much as they like for the coffee.&lt;ref name="EthicalObjections"&gt;Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics July 2011(DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importers==

Importers of Fairtrade coffee have to be registered with Fairtrade and pay a fee. Under the Fairtrade International standards they are obliged to pay a minimum price to the exporting organization, currently $1.40c/lb New York  Board of Trade “C” contract, F.O.B. origin for Arabica, and $1.05 for Robusta London “EURONEXT LIFFE” contract, F.O.B origin with 30c/lb extra for organic.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade International (FLO), “Fairtrade Minimum Price and Fairtrade Premium Table” 18.12.2012, accessed 8.1.2013; Fairtrade International (FLO) (2011), “Fairtrade Standard for Coffee for Small Producer Organizations”  version: 01.04.2011 http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-01_EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf accessed 15/1/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; When the world price is above this level, they are obliged to pay 20c/lb above the world price.

==Exporters==

Certified Fairtrade coffee is normally exported by secondary or tertiary cooperatives, marketing this coffee on behalf of the cooperatives the farmers belong to&lt;ref name="Fairtrade International 2011 p 16"&gt;Fairtrade International (FLO) (2011), “Fairtrade Standard for Coffee for Small Producer Organizations”  version: 01.04.2011 http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-01_EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf accessed 15/1/2013; Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.

(2010). Fair Trade and Free Entry: The Dissipation of Producer Benefits in a Disequilibrium Market. Retrieved December 24, 2012, from http://are.berkeley.edu/~alain/workingpapers.html.&lt;/ref&gt; There is not enough demand to take all the certified coffee produced, so most has to be sold as uncertified. In 2001 only 13.6% could be sold as certified&lt;ref&gt;Muradian, R., and W. Pelupessy. 2005. “Governing the Coffee Chain: The Role of Voluntary Regulatory Systems” World Development 33(12): 2029-2044., cited in de Janvry, A., McIntosh, C., &amp; Sadoulet, E. (2010). Fair Trade and Free Entry: The Dissipation of Producer Benefits in a Disequilibrium Market. Retrieved December 24, 2012, from http://are.berkeley.edu/~alain/workingpapers.html.&lt;/ref&gt; so limits were placed on new cooperatives joining the scheme. This plus an increased demand put up sales of certified to around 50% in 2003&lt;ref&gt;Levi, Margaret, and April Linton. 2003. “Fair Trade: A Cup at a Time?” Politics and Society 31(3): 407-32. cited in de Janvry, A., McIntosh, C., &amp; Sadoulet, E. (2010). Fair Trade and Free Entry: The Dissipation of Producer Benefits in a Disequilibrium Market. Retrieved December 24, 2012, from http://are.berkeley.edu/~alain/workingpapers.html.&lt;/ref&gt; with a figure of 37% commonly cited in recent years. Some exporting cooperatives do not manage to sell any of their output as certified,&lt;ref name="Weber, J. 2006"&gt;Weber, J. (2006), ‘Rationing in the Fair Trade coffee market: who enters and how?’, Paper presented at the ‘Second International Colloquium: Fair Trade and Sustainable Development’, University of Quebec, Montreal, 19–21 June&lt;/ref&gt; and others sell as little as  8%.&lt;ref&gt;Riedel, C. P., F. M. Lopez, A. Widdows, A. Manji and M. Schneider (2005), ‘Impacts of Fair Trade: trade and market linkages’, Proceedings of the 18th International Farming Symposium, 31 October–3 November, Rome: Food and Agricultural Organisation, http://www.fao.org/ farmingsystems&lt;/ref&gt;

The exporting cooperatives incur costs including certification and inspection fees, additional marketing costs, costs of conforming to standards, and additional costs of cooperative operation,  costs which are incurred on all coffee production, even if little or none is marketed as certified, with a higher price, so the cooperatives may make a loss on Fairtrade membership. Weber&lt;ref name="Weber, J. 2006"/&gt; reports cooperatives not able to cover the extra costs of a marketing team for Fairtrade, with one covering only 70% of these costs after six years of Fairtrade membership.

Any deficit after paying these costs means a lower price for farmers, while any surplus will normally go on “social projects” for “common goals” organized by the exporting cooperative rather than as extra payment for farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade International (FLO) (2011), “Fairtrade Standard for Coffee for Small Producer Organizations”  version: 01.04.2011 http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-01_EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf accessed 15/1/2013; Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.

Retrieved January 3, 2013, from Fairtrade International: http://www.fairtrade.net/coffee.html.&lt;/ref&gt; These may include the building of classrooms, baseball fields, or the establishment of women's groups, for instance.

== Enforcement of standards ==

FLO-CERT, a for-profit business owned by Fairtrade International, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;ref name="FLOCERT"&gt;FLO-CERT (2008). [http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en FLO-CERT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918131636/http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en |date=2009-09-18 }}. URL accessed on August 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[fair trade debate]] there are many complaints of failure to enforce these standards, with farmers, cooperatives, importers and packers.

== The marketing system==

The marketing system for Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade coffee is identical in the consuming countries, using mostly the same importing, packing, distributing and retailing firms. Some independent brands operate a virtual company, paying the normal importers, packers and distributors and advertising agencies to handle their brand rather than doing it themselves, for cost reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, I.A. and A Crane, ‘Ethical Decision Making in Fair Trade Companies’, Journal of Business Ethics 45: 79–92, 2003. P84&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fair trade organizations remain that adhere to a greater or smaller degree to the original objectives of fair trade than the mainstream of Fairtrade International and its associate. These market products through alternative channels where possible, and market through specialist fair trade shops, but they have a small proportion of the total market.&lt;ref&gt;Ballet, Jerome and Aurelie Carimentrand ‘Fair trade and the Depersonalization of Ethics’ Journal of Business Ethics (2010) 92:317–330 _ Springer 2010 DOI 10.1007/s10551-010-0576-0.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms ==

Criticisms of fair trade have been made as a result of independent research, and these are summarized in the [[fair trade debate]].

There are also some criticisms of fair trade specific to coffee. Colleen Haight of the Stanford Innovation Review argues that fair trade coffee is merely a way to market the idea of [[ethical consumerism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_problem_with_fair_trade_coffee|title=The Problem with Fair Trade Coffee (SSIR)|website=ssir.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quality and transparency concerns regarding coffee are increasingly common amongst some consumers and coffee companies, as seen through the rise of the [[Third wave of coffee|third wave coffee]] movement. Maintaining a balance between ethical and higher-quality coffee may be difficult with fair trade coffee due to what some coffee roasters deem as insufficient quality incentive within many fair-trade certified coffee farms. Deborah Sick’s research, involving interviews with coffee farmers in Costa Rica, finds that many farmers often produce more fair trade coffee than they can sell, so will often end up selling to independent buyers that will often pay more than fair trade buyers can.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sick|first=Deborah|date=2008-08-20|title=Coffee, Farming Families, and Fair Trade in Costa Rica: New Markets, Same Old Problems?|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/245424|journal=Latin American Research Review|volume=43|issue=3|pages=193–208|doi=10.1353/lar.0.0042|issn=1542-4278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars are concerned of the artificial stimulation of coffee production, especially since worldwide demand for coffee is relatively inelastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/8380592|title=Voting with your trolley|date=2006-12-07|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-04-17|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many who believe fair trade coffee is insufficient utilize the [[direct trade]] model, which allows for more control over quality concerns, farmer empowerment, and sustainability issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethicalcoffee.net/direct.html|title=What is Direct Trade coffee?|website=www.ethicalcoffee.net|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also is valuable in harboring closer farmer to roaster business relationships, which can ultimately increase quality of life and profits for coffee growers and buyers alike. However, direct trade is a new concept that is only utilized by for profit businesses like Counter Culture Coffee and Intelligentsia Coffee and therefore has no third party certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://counterculturecoffee.com/sustainability|title=Sustainability {{!}} Counter Culture Coffee|date=2016-08-11|work=Counter Culture Coffee|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/learn-do/community/intelligentsia-direct-trade|title=Learn &amp; Do {{!}} Community {{!}} Direct Trade {{!}} Intelligentsia Coffee|website=www.intelligentsiacoffee.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The''' '''Holberg Prize''' is an international prize awarded annually by the [[government of Norway]] to outstanding scholars for work in [[the arts]], [[humanities]], [[social sciences]], law and theology, either within one of these fields or through interdisciplinary work. The prize is named after the Danish-Norwegian writer and academic [[Ludvig Holberg]] (1684 - 1754). The Holberg Prize comes with a monetary award of 6 million Norwegian kroner ([[Norwegian krone|NOK]]) (approximately $750 000 or €660 000), which are intended to be used to further the research of the recipient. The winner of the Holberg Prize is announced in March, and the award ceremony takes place every June in Bergen, Norway.

== History ==
The prize was established by the [[Parliament of Norway]] in honor of [[Ludvig Holberg]] in 2003 and complements its sister prize in mathematics, the [[Abel Prize]]. Ludvig Holberg, who excelled in all the disciplines covered by the award, played an important part in bringing the Enlightenment to the Nordic countries and is also well known as a playwright and author. The objective of the prize was to increase awareness of the value of academic scholarship in the arts,humanities, social sciences, law and theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://holbergprisen.no/en/about-holberg-prize|title=About the Holberg Prize|last=Longva|first=Hjørdis Maria|date=2010-02-18|work=Holbergprisen|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as the "Nobel Prize" for the arts and humanities, social sciences, law and theology.

== Selection criteria ==
The Holberg Prize is awarded annually to scholars who have made "outstanding contributions to research in the arts and humanities, social sciences, law or theology." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.holbergprisen.no/en/about-holberg-prize|title=About the Holberg Prize|last=Longva|first=Hjørdis Maria|date=2010-02-18|work=Holbergprisen|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars holding positions at universities and other research institutions, including academies, are eligible to nominate candidates to the Holberg Prize and the Nils Klim Prize. Self-nominations are not permitted. The Holberg Board awards the prize at the recommendation of the Holberg Committee.The Holberg Committee meets twice. At the first meeting, in early fall, they choose a shortlist from the nominations. The Committee then gather assessments on the short-list candidates from internationally recognized scholars before giving their final recommendation to the Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.holbergprisen.no/en/about-holberg-prize|title=About the Holberg Prize|last=Longva|first=Hjørdis Maria|date=2010-02-18|work=Holbergprisen|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==
The Holberg Prize is funded through a direct allocation from the Norwegian government's budget. It is administered by the University of Bergen on behalf of the Ministry of Education and Research. The University of Bergen appoints the executive board of the Holberg Prize. The Holberg Board consists of the board chair and four board member. The board members must work in different institutions, and at least one board member must work outside the university and university college sector. Board members are appointed for a period of four years and may be reappointed once. Current chair of the Holberg board is professor [[Sigmund Grønmo]]. 
[[File:Bergen Museum garden.jpg|thumb|''The Holberg Prize is awarded annually in the University Aula in Bergen.'']]

== The Holberg Week ==
During The Holberg Week in June, The Holberg Prize hosts a series of lectures, discussions and other events in honor of the Holberg Laureate and the Nils Klim Laureate. The events feature the laureates, as well as other high-profile international scholars. The program feature, among other things, the Holberg Symposium, the Nils Klim Seminar and the Holberg Lecture. All events during the Holberg week, with the exception of the award ceremony and government banquet, are open to all and have free entrance. Several of the events are also livestreamed, and available to an international audience.

In addition to The Holberg Week, The Holberg Debate is held in December each year. The debate marks Ludvig Holberg's ideas of enlightenment, and seeks to discuss and find answers to key social issues. The Holberg Debate was held for the first time in 2016. Former participants in the Holberg Debate are [[Timothy Garton Ash]], [[Jostein Gripsrud]], [[Jonathan Heawood]], [[John Pilger]] and [[Julian Assange]].

== Other prizes ==
As part of its research dissemination targeting younger people, the Holberg Prize also awards two other prizes:

*'''The Nils Klim Prize''' is awarded annually to a younger Nordic researcher who has made an outstanding contribution to research in the arts and humanities, social science, law or theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.holbergprisen.no/en/nils-klim-prize|title=Nils Klim Prize|last=Longva|first=Hjørdis Maria|date=2015-03-05|work=Holbergprisen|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Pitts''' (1663–1735?) was an Englishman who was taken into slavery by Barbary pirates from Algeria in 1678 at the age of fourteen or fifteen. Little is known about Pitts aside from what is revealed in his narrative concerning his time held captive in Northern Africa, during which time he went through three masters ranging widely in their cruelty towards him over the course of more than fifteen years, with whom he travelled to Cairo and Alexandria. Though he escaped between the years 1693 and 1694, it was not until 1704 that Pitts first published his account. Pitts's ''A True and Faithful Account of the Religion and Manners of the Mohammetans, with an Account of the Author's Being Taken Captive'' includes descriptions of his capture and captivity, including some of the first English descriptions of Islamic rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, Joseph. ''A True and Faithful Account of the Religion and Manners of the Mohammetans, with an Account of the Author's Being Taken Captive'' (1704) reprinted in ''Piracy, Slavery, and Redemption: Barbary Captivity Narratives from Early Modern England'', ed. Daniel J. Vitkus (New York: Columbia University Press, 2001), 218–340&lt;/ref&gt; Converting to the religion while a slave, Pitts was the first Englishman to record the proceedings of the hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam. Pitts also describes the people of seventeenth-century North Africa (whom he calls Turks or Mohammetans) in detail, providing particulars on their manner of eating and dressing, the customs of their religion and marriage, and their economic and slave systems. Though its accuracy is debatable, Pitts’s narrative was the first and most detailed description of the religion of Islam and the manners of Muslims written by a European during the seventeenth century.

== Pitts and the hajj ==

It was during Pitts’s time with his last master that he made his journey to [[Mecca]] to complete the [[hajj]]. Having converted to Islam under the urgings and tortures of his second master Ibrahim, Pitts departed for the hajj with his third master around 1685. His account described many of the aspects of the Islamic pilgrimage including the hajj caravans, the rites at Mecca, and the customary but not mandatory visit to [[Medina]]. Much of Pitts's account of the hajj can be verified as accurate, but there is debate as to the truthfulness of some of his relations.

=== Initial rites ===

As a pilgrim, Pitts participated in the initial rites upon arriving in Mecca. This time is filled with the pilgrims' first tawaf, cleansing and drinking at the [[Zamzam Well]], and completion of the sa 'y or sa 'i. Scholars seem to disagree as to what brought about this tradition, whether a re-enactment of Mohammad's reclaiming of the temple for Islam or that of the seven planets rotating around the sun.&lt;ref name="InsideMecca"&gt;''Inside Mecca''. Dir. Taghi Amirani &amp; Anisa Mehdi. National Geographic Television, 2003. DVD; Wolfe, Michael. ''One Thousand Roads to Mecca''. New York: Grove Press, 1997. xxii–xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the real reasoning or meaning behind the seven turnings around the Ka ‘ba, it became a part of the Islamic tradition of the hajj and was being performed by pilgrims immediately upon their arrival well before Pitts’s time. After this ritual is the cleansing at the Zamzam Well, something Pitts seems to have left out of his narrative. Peters describes the Islamic legend tracing the origins of this well to a time when Abraham’s wife Hagar was left in the middle of the desert with their son Ishmael who was dying of thirst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peters|first=F.E.|title=The Hajj: The Muslim Pilgrimage to Mecca and the Holy Places|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1994|pages=197 &amp; 199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desperately running back and forth in search of water between two low hills called Safa and Marwa, God brought forth water from a spot in the desert for Hagar to give to her child.&lt;ref name="InsideMecca" /&gt; An example of this interaction with the Zamzam Well shortly after the tawaf can be found in an account by Ali Bey al-Abbasi, a Spaniard who went on the hajj in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Michael. ''One Thousand Roads to Mecca''. New York: Grove Press, 1997. 146 &amp; 149; Peters, F.E. ''The Hajj: The Muslim Pilgrimage to Mecca and the Holy Places''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994. 197 &amp; 199.&lt;/ref&gt;  In chapter 7 of his narrative, Pitts mentions the drinking of the water but not in connection with these initial rites. Whether this is due to a mistake by Pitts or a genuine difference in the order of the hajj of the 1600s is hard to determine. However, this initial water rite then brings pilgrims to what is called the sa ‘y, a recreation of Hagar’s desperate search for water which they complete by running back and forth between the same hills seven times. Today this is completed within the mosque in Mecca called Masjid al-Haram. During Pitts’s time and up until the 1950s, this was completed out on the street.&lt;ref name="InsideMecca" /&gt;

=== Mount Arafat ===

The vigil at Mount Arafat is another important aspect of the hajj which Pitts discusses. In chapter 7, Pitts says that they leave Mecca to visit “a certain hill called Gibbel el orphat (or el-Arafat), i.e., the Mountain of Knowledge.” Here he witnesses them perform Yawm al-Wukuf or the Day of Standing Together before God. Islamic legend explains that this hill was the place where Adam and Eve met after their expulsion from the Garden of Eden as well as where the Day of Judgment will take place. For pilgrims, it is “a place set aside for spiritual reunion, where pilgrims travel to re-form family ties, seek pardon, and re-collect their spirits.”&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Michael. ''One Thousand Roads to Mecca''. New York: Grove Press, 1997. xxii–xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Though it is the “how, when, and where [pilgrims] receive this honorable title of hajji for which they are at all this pains and expense," Pitts claims that as to "why they so solemnly approach this mountain beyond any other place and receive from hence the title of hagges" he did not know, adding he gave "but little heed to these delusions."&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, "A True and Faithful Account", Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes the times that they perform their preparations for the prayers and rites to be completed while at the hill, and how "they [beg] earnestly for the remission of their sins and [promise] newness of life using a form of penitential expressions and thus continuing for the space of four or five hours."&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, ''A True and Faithful Account'', Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trauma ==

Pitts was subject to numerous forms of [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] during his enslavement.  These included:

* [[Blunt trauma|Physical trauma]], when he was repeatedly beaten by his patrons.
* [[Slavery|Enslavement]] trauma, described by Orlando Patterson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=Orlando|title=Slavery and Social Death|year=1982|publisher=Harvard College|location=Cambridge|isbn=067481083X|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a form of social death, wherein trauma is derived from the severance from any form of autonomy.
* [[Adoption]] trauma, wherein there is a traumatic component to being separated from the parent and later adopted by another.  Pitts's adoption, in emotion if not in law, by his third patroon had traumatic ramifications on Pitts' [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. 
Due to these traumatic experiences Pitts developed a form of [[PTSD]].  Many scholars of memoir and PTSD have noted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peres|first=Julio F. P.|author2=Alexander Moreira-Almeida, Antonia Gladys Nasello and Harold G. Koenig|title=Spirituality and Resilience in Trauma Victims|journal=Journal of Religion and Health|year=2007|pages=343–350|doi=10.1007/s10943-006-9103-0|volume=46|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Homans|first=Margaret|title=Adoption Narratives, Trauma and Origins|journal=Narrative|date=January 2006|volume=14|pages=4–26|doi=10.1353/nar.2005.0026}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the memoirs of the traumatised often take the form of a "working out" of the trauma, an examination of the causes and meanings of the trauma by a slow and steady examination of events to make sense of them.  This reflects itself in Pitts's writing in the slow and steady buildup to the chapters that talk about the incidents of severe trauma, such as the beating received from his first and second masters and the emotional complexities of his [[Religious conversion#Islam|conversion]] and later adoption.

== Sexuality, women, and slavery in Pitts's narrative ==

Pitts does not often mention women in his writings. It appears there are very few opportunities for him to be around women of any sort of status. However, the encounters he does write about give good insight into the Western views of Islamic attitudes about women. Pitts is not a stranger to violence. He is captured, enslaved, tortured, sold, and endures countless hardships throughout his journey. Pitts encounters violence against women several times in his account, most notably when describing the Imperial Turkish camps. He writes that the soldiers are "apt to drink, and are abominably rude, insomuch that it is very dangerous for any woman to walk in any by-place but more dangerous for boys, for they are extremely given to sodomy…" (236). In this passage, and in the context surrounding it, Pitts only mentions the danger to women once and focuses more acutely on the sin of sodomy amongst the soldiers. This shows that sexual violence is normalised for Pitts; he is much more concerned about the sin of sodomy than the sin of rape. He focuses intently on the immorality of sodomy but says nothing of the immorality of raping a woman.

In his discussion of marriage, Pitts describes how the marriage agreement takes place between the groom and the father of the bride. The woman's possible feelings or misgiving about the union are not mentioned at all. Pitts appears to perceive women as having little to no power in their relationships with men (242). He also discusses the idea of divorce and of Muslim men having multiple wives. According to Pitts, divorce is fairly common in the Islamic world and both parties are free to remarry afterwards. Multiple wives are not as common though; Pitts reports that very few men have multiple wives except out in the rural areas (243). These notions of power in relation to females are very much based in English ideas. Women in England gave up their property and dowries to their husbands upon marriage. Divorce was not common nor easy in England, although Pitts never details if a woman is allowed to ask for a divorce. Multiple wives were not as common among the middle and lower class of Muslim society; if Pitts did not rub elbows with the elite he would not have seen this phenomenon.

Pitts details a visit to a slave market in Cairo while he is on the hajj with one of his masters. In the market place, Pitts observes the selling of women and men. While men are forced to act out tricks to show off their strength and abilities like a horse show, the women are treated in a different manner. Women would be dressed in fine clothing when being exposed in markets, in hopes of catching a buyer's eye.&lt;ref name="Pitts1704" /&gt; Pitts says that while the women's faces were veiled, men were allowed to freely view their faces, to feel the inside of their mouths and teeth, and to caress their breasts. If a woman's virginity was questioned, slave traders would sometimes permit a potential buyer to escort the she-slave into a private tent, allowing the customer to discover the answer to the question themselves.&lt;ref name="Pitts1704" /&gt; He notes that many of the slaves are women and children as the men are kept as rowing slaves aboard ships. He also describes many of the people as "Muscovites and Russians, and from those parts and some of the emperor of Germany's parts" (270). These slaves have lighter skin, and they are dressed in fine clothing so they will fetch a higher price at auction.  The slaves are examined much like animals; buyers are allowed to checked their teeth, muscles, and stature to get an idea of the overall health of a slave.

== Pitts and his masters ==

Pitts served a total of three masters, with varying degrees of treatment. Not very much insight is given of his first master, but we do know that his second master, Ibrahim, treated him very poorly (318).&lt;ref name="Pitts1704"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pitts|first=Joseph|title=A True and Faithful Account of the Religion and Manners of the Mohammetans, with an Account of the Author's Being Taken Captive|year=1704|publisher=Exon|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of Pitts' capture, he mentions the poor diet that they were fed was equal to the treatment they received. When planning a mutinous revolt, Pitts describes how the rebellion was discovered. A man who was suspected of the idea of the uprising was brought forward in front of his fellow captives. Pitts states: ‘The captain, with a great rope, gave him about an hundred blows on his buttocks, but he would not confess the fact, generously choosing rather to suffer himself than to bring us all under the bastinadoes also’ (228).  Ellen Friedman points out that the free Muslim man’s diet was no better than the captives’.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Ellen|title=Christian Captive at Hard Labor|journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies|pages=116–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman also addresses that captives were treated harshly to make certain that they were kept in line and knew their place. Their self-worth was often undermined and the captives would be humiliated in front of their companions. Robert Davis, in the book ''Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast, and Italy'', says that ceaseless beatings and humiliation are established at the beginning of the capture to not only frighten new slaves, but to ensure silent obedience as well. Many slaves watched as their companions were reprimanded into bloody unconsciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Robert|title=Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast, and Italy, 1500–1800|publisher=Hampshire: Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitts’ narrative then turns to the forcing of converting to Islam. He states: ‘It hath been affirmed by some that the slaves that are sold in this country are never compelled to turn to the Mohammetan religion.’ While this is deemed true, there are rare cases like Pitts who have been forced into conversion. His second master, Ibrahim, had hung Pitts upside down, revealing the bottoms of his bare feet and dealing out 300 blows with a cudgel. Though Pitts had changed religions, Ibrahim treated him just as maliciously as he had before, beating Pitts until his blood poured onto the ground. This type of treatment was unusual. The Qur'an instructs masters to treat their slaves with firm kindness. Though they might not have shared the same expectations about work and life, master and slaves mutually understood and shared “a bundle of mutual obligations.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lovejoy|first=Paul E.|title=The Ideology of Slavery in Africa|year=1981|publisher=Beverly Hills: Sage Publications|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves were meant to be kept healthy to work efficiently. If slaves were unproductive in their line of work, then they would be punished.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Ellen G. "Christian Captive at Hard Labor." ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'' 13.4 (n.d.): 616-32; Clissold, Stephen. ''The Barbary Slaves''. 1st ed. Totowa: Rowman Littlefield, 1977. 86–101&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitts’ third and last master was more of an ideal master. While Pitts wanted nothing to do with his master from the beginning, he soon became affectionate towards him when he saw that the master intended to give him a letter of freedom (323). Pitts describes his master treating him like a son, seeing as he had no children or relatives to love. Pitts also saw him in a fatherly light and, after given the letter of freedom, continued to stay with him for he was so kind. Freeing a slave was looked at as a great act of piety, and the act could allow the slave master to be forgiven of his sins. Even serious sins such as murder could be forgiven by the freeing of a slave. When Pitts makes the decision to leave, escaping back to his native homeland, he becomes conflicted with the situation of whether or not he should leave his fatherlike master who had made promises of leaving all of his belongings to Pitts after his death (332).

== Controversy ==

=== Conversion ===

At the time period in which Pitts's narrative was written, many other writers of slave narratives were claiming, like Pitts, to have been forced or tricked into converting to Islam. However, research suggests that such claims were likely to be false. Research suggests that North Africa was religiously very tolerant at this time and that Christian captives who converted were likely to benefit from lying about having converted because the English Christians—their own families included—would have persecuted them.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Claire. "Lust, Greed, Torture, and Identity: Narrations of Conversion and the Creation of the Early Modern Renegade." ''Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East'' 29.2 (2009): 259–268. Project MUSE. Web. 1 March 2013. &lt;http://muse.jhu.edu/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This research suggests that Pitts might have done the same and that Pitts's alleged experience of having been forcibly converted would have been a special case, if true at all. More research, suggesting that Islam and renegades were often vilified in British culture and media, gives Pitts another reason to have lied about his conversion. Researchers describe the way, in English theatre at this time, renegades were often considered to be on par with Satan-worshipers and atheists, and traitors to their countries.&lt;ref&gt;Matar, Nabil. "The Renegade in English Seventeenth-Century Imagination." ''Studies in English Literature 1500–1900''. 33.3 (1993): 489–505; Clissold, Stephen. ''The Barbary Slaves''. 1st ed. Totowa: Rowman Littlefield, 1977. 86–101; Colley, Linda. ''Captives''. 1st ed. New York: Pantheon Books, 2002. 99–134.&lt;/ref&gt;  In direct reference to Pitts's writings, some research brings up the way that Pitts admitted to having been tempted to remain a Muslim, as well as admitting to the advantages offered him by doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Colley, Linda. ''Captives''. 1st ed. New York: Pantheon Books, 2002. 99–134. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical abuse ===

There is controversy within the academic community as to the veracity of the abuse that Pitts, and many of his fellow captives, received at the hands of their masters.  Many scholars cast doubt on Pitts’s account.  Claire Norton posits various reasons why beating a slave as a form of proselytisation would have been illogical.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Claire. "Lust, Greed, Torture, and Identity."&lt;/ref&gt; A slave beaten into conversion would be of no economical value as Muslims were socially pressured to free their slaves once they converted.  The Barbary Coast was also very egalitarian in its religious diversity, Christian services being held in various places, decreasing the likelihood that a Christian would have no place in Islamic society.

Other scholars, such as Robert Davis, also doubt the validity of many slave narratives while allowing that the use of violence against one slave served “as a warning to all the other slaves who might witness or hear of it to be on their best behavior.”&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Robert C. ''Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters''. 1st ed. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Pitts himself discredits the forced conversion trope, stating that this was a rare occurrence, “though it was my hard fortune to be so unmercifully dealt with.” However, Pitts provides a reason why his masters would have used violent force against him, namely that one of his masters had a sordid past and hoped to unburden his sins by forcing Pitts to convert and then freeing him, a holy rite within Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, ''A True and Faithful Account'', Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology''' ('''KNUST''') is a university in [[Kumasi]], [[Ashanti Region|Ashanti]], [[Ghana]]. The Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology is the [[public university]] established in the country, as well as the largest university in [[Kumasi|Kumasi Metropolis]] and Ashanti. KNUST has its roots in the plans of the [[Prempeh I|King Asantehene Agyeman Prempeh I]] to establish a university in Kumasi as part of his drive towards modernization of his [[Ashanti Kingdom|Ashanti kingdom]]. This plan never came to fruition due to the clash between British empire expansion and the desire for King Prempeh I to preserve his Ashanti kingdom's independence.

However, his younger brother and successor, [[Osei Tutu Agyeman Prempeh II|King Asantehene Agyeman Prempeh II]], upon ascending to the [[Golden Stool]] in 1935, continued with this vision. Events in the [[Gold Coast]] in the 1940s played into his hands. First there was the establishment of the University College of the Gold Coast. Second there were the 1948 riots and the consequent Watson Commission report which recommended that a university of sciences be established in Kumasi. Thus, in 1949, the dream of the Prempehs became a reality when building started on what was to be called the Kumasi College of Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eaumf.org/ejm-blog/2018/1/23/january-22-1952-kumasi-college-of-technology-is-established|title=January 22, 1952: Kumasi College of Technology is established|work=Edward A. Ulzen Memorial Foundation|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kumasi College of Technology offered admission to its first students to the engineering faculty in 1951 (they entered in 1952), and an Act of Parliament gave the university its legal basis as the [[Kumasi College of Technology]] in 1952. The nucleus of the college was formed from 200 teacher training students transferred from [[Achimota]] in the [[Greater Accra Region]]. The college was affiliated to the [[University of London]]. In 1961, the college was granted full university status.&lt;ref name="Daniel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~univghana/ghanahed.htm |title=THE UNIVERSITIES IN GHANA |accessdate=10 March 2007 |author=G.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
[[File:Kwame nkrumah.jpg|thumb|right|Osagyefo Dr. [[Kwame Nkrumah]], the first President of the Republic of Ghana]]
The Kumasi College of Technology opened officially on 22 January 1952 with 200 teacher training students transferred from [[Achimota]], to form the nucleus of the new college. In October 1952, the School of Engineering and the Department of Commerce were established and the first students were admitted. A Pharmacy Department was established in January 1953, with the transfer of the former School of Pharmacy from [[Korle Bu Teaching Hospital]], [[Accra]], to the college. The department ran a two-year comprehensive course in Pharmacy leading to the award of the Pharmacy Board Certificate. A Department of Agriculture was opened in the same year to provide ad hoc courses of varying duration, from a few terms to three years, for the Ministry of Agriculture. A Department of General Studies was instituted to prepare students for the Higher School Certificate Examinations in Science and Arts subjects and to give instruction in subjects as requested by the other departments.

From 1952 to 1955, the School of Engineering prepared students for professional qualifications only. In 1955, the school embarked on courses leading to the [[University of London]] Bachelor of Engineering External Degree Examinations.

In 1957, the School of Architecture, Town Planning and Building was inaugurated. Its first students were admitted in January 1958, for professional courses. As the college expanded, it was decided to make the Kumasi College of Technology a purely science and technology institution. In pursuit of this policy, the Teacher Training College, with the exception of the Art School, was transferred in January 1958, to the Winneba Training College; in 1959 the Commerce Department was transferred to Achimota to form the nucleus of the present School of Administration of the [[University of Ghana]], Legon.

In December 1960, the [[Government of Ghana]] appointed a University Commission to advise it on the development of university education, in connection with the proposal to transform the University College of Ghana and the Kumasi College of Technology into an independent University of Ghana. Following the report of the commission which came out early 1961, the government decided to establish two independent universities in Kumasi and [[Legon]], Accra. The Kumasi College of Technology was thus transformed, under the supervision of [[R. P. Baffour]], into a full-fledged University Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology by an Act of [[Parliament of Ghana|Parliament]] on 22 August 1961. The name honors [[Kwame Nkrumah]], the first prime minister and later [[president of Ghana]].

The name was changed to University of Science and Technology after the Revolution of 24 February 1966. The University of Science and Technology was officially inaugurated on Wednesday, 20 November 1961. However, another act of Parliament (Act 559 of 1998) changed the name back to its original version, the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi.&lt;ref name="KNUST_History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knust.edu.gh/hospital/pages/sections.php?siteid=knust&amp;mid=14&amp;sid=94&amp;id=115|title=Our History|author=|work=Official Website|publisher=Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology|date=|accessdate=29 October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305164113/http://knust.edu.gh/hospital/pages/sections.php?siteid=knust&amp;mid=14&amp;sid=94&amp;id=115|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization and administration ==

=== Principal officers ===
[[File:KNUST main entrance with Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park.jpg|thumb|The main entrance of the KNUST, Kumasi and the Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park with a statue of the first [[President of Ghana|president]] of the [[Ghana|Republic of Ghana]] and the founder of the university with five smaller figures in national attire playing drums]]
The principal officers of the university are the chancellor, chairman of the University Council and vice-chancellor. As of 2018, the position of chancellor was held by the Asantehene [[Otumfuo Nana Osei Tutu II|Otumfuo Osei Tutu II]].

=== Governing body ===
Governance is carried out by the [[University Council]], primarily through the Academic Board, which is responsible for:
* formulating and carrying out the academic policy of the university
* devising and regulating the courses of instruction and study, and supervising research
* regulating the conduct of examinations and the award of degrees, diplomas and certificates
* advising the University Council on the admission of students and the award of scholarships
* reporting on such matters as may be referred to it by the University Council

=== Student participation in university administration ===
Students participate in the administration of the university through their representatives serving on the University Council, Academic Board, the Welfare Services Board, Faculty and Departmental Boards, Residence Committee, Library Committee and on the Hall Councils.&lt;ref name="KNUST_SRC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://src.knust.edu.gh/ |title=KNUST Students' Representative Council |accessdate=29 October 2009 |work=Official Website |publisher=Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827124806/http://src.knust.edu.gh/ |archivedate=27 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collegiate system ===
[[File:College of Engineering, KNUST Auditorium.JPG|thumb|College of Engineering, KNUST [[auditorium]]]]
KNUST has, since January 2005, transformed from its previous centralized system of administration into a decentralized [[collegiate university]]. Under this system, the faculties have been condensed into six colleges.

The university had been administered on the faculty-based system. This led to administrative difficulties as new faculties and institutes were created to meet the ever-growing academic pursuits of students. To solve this problem, a collegiate system was officially adopted on 29 November 2004. On 5 April 2005, the pioneering provosts were inducted and invested into office at the Great Hall of the KNUST.

The colleges are semi-autonomous, which means that they are given the power to largely run on their own without much dependence on the central administration for financial support. A college registrar, finance officer and librarian assist the provosts. Under them are the faculties, centres and institutes, headed by deans and directors. As heads of the colleges, the provosts provide academic and administrative leadership for the colleges and oversee their overall running.&lt;ref name="KNUST_VCs_Report_2009"&gt;{{Citation |title = The Vice-Chancellor's Report |publisher=University Press - KNUST |location=Kumasi |date=June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Housing and Accommodation ==
There are numerous KNUST approved hostels mostly within close proximity to main campus. Students of all financial backgrounds have their accommodation needs catered for. There are six halls of residence at the Kumasi campus, each administered by a hall council consisting of senior and junior members. The executive head is the hall master, who is assisted by a senior tutor. There is a hall bursar and other supporting staff.&lt;ref name="KNUST_Halls"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.knust.edu.gh/students/housing/halls |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618221801/http://www.knust.edu.gh/students/housing/halls |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 June 2013 |title=Halls of Residence |accessdate=29 October 2009 |work=Official Website |publisher=Kwame Nkrumah University of Scienhostel tice and Technology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Halls of residence ===

==== Hostels ====
About 60% of the student population is non-resident. There are private hostels around the campus and in Kumasi for students who, as a result of the limited facilities/rooms, could not be admitted as resident students.&lt;ref name="KNUST_Hostel Tips for Students"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.knust.edu.gh/students/housing/housing-tips |title=Hostel Tips for students |accessdate=29 October 2009 |work=Official Website |publisher=Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618221644/http://www.knust.edu.gh/students/housing/housing-tips |archivedate=18 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are facilities on campus where non-resident students can rest between lectures and study before they leave for their homes and hostels.

In January 2014, the top floor of the Crystal Rose Hostel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investigations begin into KNUST hostel fire|url=http://graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/15543-investigations-begin-into-knust-hostel-fire.html|author=Felix A.

[[File:Peace Pole, Kumasi, Ghana.jpg|thumb|The [[Peace Pole]] was erected on the campus of the university on 21 September 2006 on the [[International Day of Peace]]. The pole is made of a 105-year-old [[sapele]] tree that used to stand in the university's botanical garden. The pole is {{convert|16.7|m|ft|abbr=off}} tall. Indigenous symbols have been carved in bas-relief on it in five languages ([[Akan language|Twi]]—a local language in Ghana, [[Standard Hindi|Hindi]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]). The peace prayer on the pole says: "May peace be upon Earth"]]

The Professorship, a new statutory chair, was created upon the retirement of Joseph Raz from his personal Chair, also at Balliol. It is one of just two statutory professorships in [[jurisprudence]] at Oxford, the other being held by [[John Gardner (law)|John Gardner]]. In 2010, the distinguished lawyer, Philip Gordon, endowed the Balliol fellowship, and Green became the first Pauline and Max Gordon Fellow at Balliol.  At the same time, Green took up a part-time appointment as Professor and Distinguished University Fellow in the Philosophy of Law at Queen's University.

'''Leveraging Agriculture for Improving Nutrition and Health''' is the title of a global policy consultation and international conference to be held in New Delhi, India from 10–12 February 2011, which will examine the linkages between work undertaken in the [[agriculture]], [[nutrition]] and [[health]] sectors. The conference is organized by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI) with support from the [[Asian Development Bank]], the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], [[GTZ|Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ)]], the Indian Economic Association,&lt;ref name="IEA"&gt;[http://indianeconomicjournal.org/indian-economic-association/ Website of the Indian Economic Association]&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Development Research Centre|IDRC]], [[PepsiCo]], [[Department for International Development|UK Department for International Development (DFID)]], [[United States Agency for International Development|United States Agency for International Development (USAID)]], [[Feed the Future Initiative]],&lt;ref name="FFI"&gt;[http://www.feedthefuture.gov/ Website of the Feed the Future Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt; and The [[World Bank]].&lt;ref name="ConferenceWebsite"&gt;[http://2020conference.ifpri.info/ Leveraging Agriculture for Improving Nutrition and Health]. International Conference, 10–12 February 2011, New Delhi, India.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linkages between Agriculture, Nutrition and Health==
Agricultural products are not only sources of [[energy]] and nutrients, but also sources of [[fuel]], [[medicine]], [[fiber]], and [[lumber]]. Agriculture as an activity is also the source of livelihood and income for much of the world’s population, especially those living in rural areas. For this reason, agriculture has a considerable, positive impact on health and nutrition.&lt;ref name="HawkesRuel2006"&gt;Hawkes, C. and M. Ruel. 2006. [http://www.ifpri.org/publication/understanding-links-between-agriculture-and-health Understanding the Links between Agriculture and Health]. 2020 Focus 13. Brief 1. Washington D.C.: IFPRI.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the downside, agriculture has many negative effects on health. Agricultural production, [[trade]], and distribution can negatively affect the environment through pesticide and fertilizer runoff polluting the soil and ground water.&lt;ref name="WDR08FocusH"&gt;The World Bank. 2008. [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDR2008/Resources/2795087-1192112387976/WDR08_18_Focus_H.pdf The two-way links between agriculture and health]. Focus H of the [http://go.worldbank.org/ZJIAOSUFU0 World Development Report 2008: Agriculture for Development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517025442/http://go.worldbank.org/ZJIAOSUFU0 |date=2008-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to WHO, around 1.1 billion people still lack access to safe drinking water.&lt;ref name="WHO2010"&gt;World Health Organization. 2010. [http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/mdg1/en/index.html Health through safe drinking water and basic sanitation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other negative effects include health and environmental risks to producers and laborers by being exposed to bad weather, handling chemical and biological products, working long hours, or using dangerous agricultural machinery.

Conversely, health and nutrition can also influence agriculture. Poor health affects farm productivity and household income, creating a vicious circle of [[poverty]], [[food insecurity]], and ill health.&lt;ref name="HawkesRuel2006" /&gt;

==The Policy Consultation and Conference==

===Rationale===
The goal of the policy consultation is to overcome the isolation of policymakers and practitioners working in the agriculture, nutrition, and health sectors and to leverage the strong interactions and synergies among these sectors. In view of the problems many poor countries face to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) by 2015, the initiative hopes to consolidate information and build consensus for a joint action leveraging agriculture to improve nutrition and health.&lt;ref name="ConceptNote"&gt;[http://2020conference.ifpri.info/files/2010/09/2020anh_conceptnote.pdf Leveraging Agriculture for Improving Nutrition and Health].

ONE, November 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process and Events===
The process started in October and November 2010 with three seminars in Washington, DC.

'''Media linguistics''' is the [[linguistics|linguistic]] study of media speech. It studies the functioning of [[language]] in the [[Mass media|media]] sphere, or the modern [[mass communication]] presented by print, audiovisual and networked media.

Media linguistics is being formed in the process of [[Differentiation (linguistics)|differentiation]] of [[linguistics]] as a general theory of language, and its term turned out to be in line with [[psycholinguistics]], [[sociolinguistics]], [[developmental linguistics]], [[legal linguistics]], [[political linguistics]], etc.{{cn|date=February 2013}}

== Object ==
Modern media linguistics examines not only the language of media, but also media speech. Media linguistics includes such discipline as ''media speech studies'' that examines (1) the speech behavior of [[mass communication]] participants and (2) specific areas, textures and genres of media texts. 

Thus, in principle, media linguistics seeks to explain the particular case of the functioning of language—in mass communications with its complex structure and diverse trends of change—amid the overall trends of language and speech culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2010).  Swedish Television as a mechanism for language planning and policy. &lt;I&gt;Language Problems and Language Planning, 34&lt;/i&gt;(2), 158-181.&lt;/ref&gt; Media linguistics is closely related to the contemporary media practices and intends to impact on them, in particular, by means of media education.

== In various countries ==
* In '''English-speaking countries''' the terms ''[[Media studies|media study]]'' and ''media [[discourse analysis]]'' are used, corresponding with such interdisciplinary approach as [[Critical discourse analysis]]. See, for example, [[Teun A. van Dijk]]'s book ''News as Discourse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= News as Discourse|year=1988|publisher= Hillsdale NJ: Erlbaum |isbn= 0-8058-0828-0 |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/examrequest.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=12240|author= Teun A. Van Dijk |accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''Germany''' such term as ''Medienlinguistik'' is typical.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Medienlinguistik]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''Russia''' active usage of the term ''Медиалингвистика'' is associated with the publications of T.G. Dobrosklonskaya, where English media speech is investigated. Russian media linguistics is the successor of different linguistic researches, which were designated as and called "the language of newspaper", "he language of radio", "the language of media".&lt;ref&gt;"Media Linguistics": a scientific web site: http://medialing.spbu.ru/world_of_medialinguistics/ and an international journal of the same name [http://medialing.ru https://medialing.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nathalie Bondil''' (February 19, 1967), who holds both Canadian and French citizenship, has been Director General and Chief Curator of the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]] since 2007. She has worked at the museum since 1999, and is the first woman to be the museum's director.

== Quote ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I am convinced that in the twenty-first century, culture will be to health what sports were in the twenthieth century: cultural experiences will be seen to contribute to our well-being the same way sports do to our physical conditioning... Art does one good. I am convinced."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Biography ==
Nathalie Bondil holds a degree in art history from the [[École du Louvre]]. She successfully passed the entry examination for the École nationale du Patrimoine de Paris in 1994, then graduated in 1996, thereby becoming ''Conservateur du patrimoine d'État''.

From 1996 to 1998, she worked at the [[Musée des Monuments Français]] (which now forms part of the [[Cité de l'architecture et du patrimoine]]) as curator in charge of museography for the galeries dedicated to the 17th to 20th centuries, as part of the museum's renovation.

In 1999, she was hired as curator for European art from 1800 to 1945, and in 2000, promoted to chief curator, taking charge of the Curatorial Department, Conservation, the Library, Archives, Publishing and Ehxibitions. She has been the Director of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and its Chief Curator since 2007.

When she took over the helm of the MMFA, she launched a series of exhibitions that have distinguished the Museum on the international scene (exported in 35 cities over the last ten years) and innovative multidisciplinary programming: she invited fashion to the Museum (first retrospectives on ''Yves Saint Laurent'' and ''The Fashion World of Jean Paul Gaultier,'' presented in 12 cities around the world); opened it up to world cultures (''Peru: Kingdoms of the Sun and the Moon''); revamped contemporary art programming (''1+1=1''; ''Peter Doig''); and has introduced music through exhibitions (''Warhol Live; Imagine; We Want Miles''), an ongoing collaboration with foundation-in-residence Arte Musica and the daring conversion of a heritage church into a 462-seat professional concert hall, Bourgie Hall, which presents around 150 concerts and welcomes around 50,000 spectators each year.

In 2011, with the addition of a 4th building, '''The Claire and Marc Bourgie Quebec and Canadian art Pavilion''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/museum-district/claire-and-marc-bourgie-pavilion/|title=Claire and Marc Bourgie Pavilion|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathalie Bondil and her team undertook the restoration and reinstallation of some 4,000 works from the collection, from world cultures to Old Masters and Canadian and contemporary art. This "reinvented Museum" includes an impressive Pavilion of Decorative Arts and Design that was recently reinstalled and an expanded '''sculpture garden'''.

In 2012, she also led the expansion of the new educational facilities for school groups and families – '''the Studios Art &amp; Education Michel de la Chenelière'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/education/studio-art-education-michel-de-la-cheneliere/|title=Studios Art &amp; Education Michel de la Chenelières|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the major gift of Michal and Renata Hornstein’s collection of 100 Old Masters, the Museum expanded again allowing for the overhaul of over 3,000 additional works: a fifth building, '''the Michal and Renata Hornstein Pavilion for Peace''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/museum-district/future-michal-and-renata-hornstein-pavilion-for-peace/|title=Pavilion for Peace|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101005529/http://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/museum-district/future-michal-and-renata-hornstein-pavilion-for-peace/|archivedate=2015-11-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; devoted to international art and education, was inaugurated in 2016. It houses '''the Michel de la Chenelière International Atelier for Education and Art Therapy'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/frontpage-article/michel-de-la-cheneliere-international-atelier-for-education-and-art-therapy/|title=Michel de la Chenelière International Atelier for Education and Art-Therapy|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will give unparalleled impulse to the Museum’s educational and social mission. The MMFA comprises the largest educational complex at a North American art museum.

Over the past 10 years, Nathalie Bondil has sought to assert the MMFA's social relevance through its culture of innovation, with its bold multidisciplinary approach, a focus on education and respect for the audiences, unifying values and innovative forms of cooperation. She has been striving to make the MMFA empathetic and humanist in its contributions to the education and well-being of citizens and their society; a pioneer in anticipating future needs and a laboratory for innovation.

Along with working with 450 community organizations, schools, universities and associations to become an accessible and democratic hub for the arts, the MMFA's Art and Health Advisory Committee chaired by Quebec’s Chief Scientist, Rémi Quirion (a first in a Canadian museum!), was set up to oversee all pilot projects and partnerships with hospitals and the scientific research community (Alzheimer Society, Heart Institute, Douglas Hospital Research Institute, CHU Sainte-Justine.). Under Nathalie Bondil's leadership, the MMFA has also hired a full-time art therapist (a first in a museum), opened two art therapy offices in the new Michal and Renata Hornstein Pavilion for Peace (another first) as well as an art hive (another first in a museum yet again) in partnership with Concordia University to provide a place for artistic expression that is free and open to all.

Nathalie Bondil is Vice-Chair of the Canada Council for the Arts; and a member of the boards of the Chambre de commerce du Montréal Métropolitain and the Council for Canadian American Relations, of the Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD), of the French &amp; American Museum Exchange (FRAME), the Canadian Art Museum Directors Organization (CAMDO), Fonderie Darling, Comité conseil - Chaire de recherche de l'UQÀM sur la gouvernance des musées et le droit de la culture, and Comité consultatif national des HEC (Montréal). She was Vice-Chair and a member of the programming Committee of the Société des célébrations du &lt;abbr&gt;375&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/abbr&gt; anniversaire de Montréal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11538">'''Nilotic landscape''' is any artistic representation of landscapes that emulates or is inspired by the [[Nile]] river in [[Egypt]]. The term was coined to refer primarily to such landscapes created outside of Egypt, especially in the Aegean, though it is occasionally used to refer to scenes of hunting and fishing in Egyptian art. A nilotic landscape is a river scene with rich and abundant plant and animal life, much of which is native to Egypt. Common iconographic elements include papyrus, palm trees, fish and water birds, and in some cases felines, monkeys, and/or crocodile.

Archaeological evidence attests to painted depictions of the Nile in Egyptian tombs as early as the [[Predynastic]] period. Nilotic scenes remain popular throughout the Old and Middle Kingdoms, and flourish in the [[New Kingdom]]. Of particular prominence are landscapes in tombs paintings of the [[18th dynasty]] of Egypt. Nilotic landscapes are first adapted outside of Egypt in the Aegean, notably in the art of the [[Minoan civilization]]. The subject enjoys a renaissance in Hellenistic and [[Roman art]], when nilotic scenes become a common subject for [[mosaic]]s, most famously the 1st-century BC [[Nile mosaic of Palestrina]].  These emphasized the exoticism of the Nile, as well as its busyness as a waterway.  Scenes of water traffic are depicted next to abundant and often dangerous wildlife. 

A number of biblical subjects in art, such as the [[Finding of Moses]], are set in Egypt, and Christian artists slowly evolved modest conventions for conveying the unfamiliar landscape. The process accelelerated after the Renaissance, with [[Nicolas Poussin]], who painted many subjects on the life of [[Moses]], a particular pioneer in developing a more authentic decor.  But the process was slow until the start of the 19th century, with increased Western travel, the advent of modern [[Egyptology]], and in art the development of [[Orientalism]].  By the late 19th-century exotic and carefully studied or researched decor was often dominant in depictions of both landscape and human figures, whether ancient or modern.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Jason, ''Wonderful Things: A History of Egyptology 1: From Antiquity to 1881'', 255, 2015, The American University in Cairo Press, {{ISBN|9774165993}}, 9789774165993, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rd-yCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA255 google books]; Tromans, Nicholas, and others, ''The Lure of the East, British Orientalist Painting'', 2008, [[Tate Gallery|Tate Publishing]], {{ISBN|9781854377333}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The production of nilotic landscapes as well as their iconography and interpretations depend on the provenance of the work and the culture in which it was produced, but most scenes on the whole affirm and celebrate the abundance of nature.

==Iconography ==

The most important feature of a nilotic landscape is its riverine setting, which is the ultimate source of any accompanying plant and animal life. The annual flooding of the Nile river in Egypt was not only the source of the ancient civilization’s food and crops, but also provided them with a dependable cyclical calendar. Much of Egypt’s continuity in antiquity, both in society and in art, is thought to stem from the people’s relationship to the Nile.

Nilotic landscapes are filled with abundant plant and animal life. Blue and green pigments often dominate the scene. The [[papyrus]] plant and palm trees are the most recognizable botanic features of a nilotic landscape, along with other plants, often carefully depicted and identifiable. Various animals are represented and vary depending on the specific scene. Many varieties of fish and water birds are found in the scenes, and hunting and fishing scenes usually include cats.  Other nilotic landscapes, especially those outside of Egypt, include exotic, foreign animals, such as monkeys and crocodiles, and often fantastic creatures or monsters like griffins and sphinxes.

==Nilotic landscapes in Egypt==

The phrase "nilotic landscape" is used in Egyptian studies to describe the scenes in tomb paintings where the deceased is engaged in hunting and fishing. These scenes stress the elite character and importance of the deceased, who conquers nature and dominates the landscape, participating in activities reserved for the upper class.&lt;ref&gt;Tiradritti, Francesco. (2007). ''Egyptian Wall Painting''. New York: Abbeville Publishing Group (hardcover, {{ISBN|0-7892-1005-3}})&lt;/ref&gt; Many scenes are symmetrical, with the image of the deceased repeated, first engaged in the act of hunting birds and then spearing fish. The birds and fish often appear in large numbers. They are easily captured by the deceased as they appear to literally fly around him or swim right up to his spear. Thus man is shown in a position of control over nature and the natural world as subservient to his own existence. 

Though these scenes have a centuries-old tradition, they become increasingly popular in the 18th dynasty of the New Kingdom, with prominent examples of these scenes discovered in tombs from the necropolis of ancient Thebes in the [[Valley of the Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;Examples include: ''Hunting in the marsh'',
a fragment of painted plaster from the tomb of Nebamun, ''Hunting and Fishing in the marsh'',
painted plaster from the tomb of Nakht, and'' Hunting and Fishing in the marsh'',
Painted plaster from the tomb of Menna)&lt;/ref&gt; Artistically the scenes are characterized by a sense of movement and liveliness not normally seen in most Egyptian works, which for centuries portrayed static, stoic figures and creatures.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, Fred S. and Christin J. Mamiya. (2004). ''Gardner's Art through the Ages'', Vol. 1. Belmont: Wadsworth Publishing (hardcover, {{ISBN|0-534-64095-8}})&lt;/ref&gt; There is ample attention paid to detail discernible in the realistic rendering of individual plant and animal species. Variety is imparted by means of these careful details and individualized characterizations.

==Nilotic Landscapes in the Aegean ==

River scenes suggesting the natural world and its lush vegetation begin to appear outside of Egypt contemporaneously with the 18th dynasty, the first extant evidence coming from [[fresco]] fragments of the Minoans. The Aegean version of the nilotic landscape retains many key iconographic elements of the Egyptian version, but the Minoans often make the landscape itself the subject, emphasizing plants and wildlife over human figures (which are generally left out of the work). The compositions are characteristic of the Minoan artistic style, more irregular and informal. Attention is paid to detail and color with respect to plants and animals, but precisely drawn patterns seldom arise and the background and setting may be highly imaginative. They are true frescoes, painted on wet plaster so that the color chemically adheres to the surface, unlike the Egyptian versions.

Nilotic landscapes in Minoan art are evidence of contact between the Minoans and the Egyptians, both through trade and the exchange of ideas. Plants like papyrus and animals like monkeys were not native to [[Crete]]. Many of the plant and animal species are identifiable, confirming not only that the artists paid close attention to detail, but also that they must have been familiar with these species, either through examination of Egyptian painting or, as seems more likely, by means of direct contact with these creatures, plants, and Egyptian culture.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, W. Vivian and Louise Schofield. (1995). ''Egypt, the Aegean, and the Levant: Interconnections in the Second Millennium BC''. London: British Museum Press (hardcover, {{ISBN|0-7141-0987-8}})&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the “House of the Frescoes”, located near the Minoan palace at [[Knossos]], fresco fragments were unearthed depicting blue monkeys and blue birds in a rocky landscape with a winding blue river, along with various types of plants, including papyrus.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Arthur. (1936). ''The Palace of Minos at Knossos'', I-IV. London: Macmillan and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; This scene has been dubbed a “nilotic landscape” by archaeologists and art historians due to its inclusion of blue monkeys and papyrus in a riverine setting.

[[File:Akrotiri river.jpg|thumb|alt=alt text|Detail of Nilotic landscape from Thera, riverine scene with panther chasing ducks]]

Excavations at [[Akrotiri (Santorini)|Akrotiri]] on the island of [[Santorini|Thera]] have preserved a number of frescoes dating to the Late Bronze Age. One such scene from the "West House" on the east wall of Room 5 has been termed a nilotic landscape. It features a mix of real and imaginary creatures. A griffin flies over the meandering river, a wild cat stalks ducks, and palm trees pervade. Unlike the two other fresco scenes in this room, the nilotic landscape is devoid of human figures and lacks narrative, focusing instead on the wildlife and environment and glorifying the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Doumas, Cristos. (1983) ''Thera. Pompeii of the ancient Aegean. Excavations at Akrotiri, 1967-79''. London: Thames and Hudson Ltd (hardcover, {{ISBN|0-500-39016-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of human figures in these Minoan nilotic landscapes has led many archaeologists to assume the presence of a nature goddess or divinity in Minoan religion.&lt;ref&gt;Marinatos, Nanno. (1993). ''Minoan Religion: Ritual, Image, and Symbol''. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press (hardcover, {{ISBN|0-87249-744-5}})&lt;/ref&gt;

 __TOC__

==Background==

The first passive sampling devices were developed in the 1970s to determine concentrations of contaminants in the air. In 1980 this technology was first adapted for the monitoring of organic contaminants in water.&lt;ref name="Alvarez 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alvarez|first=D.|title=Development of Semipermeable Membrane Devices (SPMDs) and Polar Organic Integrative Samplers (POCIS) for Environmental Monitoring|journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry|year=2013|volume=23|pages=2179–2181|doi=10.1002/etc.2339}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial type of passive sampler developed for aquatic monitoring purposes was the semipermeable membrane device (SMPD).&lt;ref name="Alvarez 2013" /&gt; SPMD samplers are most effective at absorbing hydrophobic pollutants with a [[partition coefficient|log octanol-water partitioning coefficient]] (Kow) ranging from 4-8.&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alvarez, D. A. |author2=Huckins,J. N. |author3=Petty, J.D. |author4=Jones-Lepp, T. |author5=Stuer-Lauridsen, F. |author6=Getting, D.T. |author7=Goddard, J.P. |author8=Gravel A. |title=Comprehensive Analytical Chemistry: Passive Sampling Techniques in Environmental Monitoring|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|location=Netherlands|isbn=978-0-444-52225-2|pages=171–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the global emission of bioconcentratable [[persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs) was shown to result in adverse ecological effects, industry developed a wide range of increasing water-soluble, polar [[hydrophilic]] organic compounds (HpOCs) to replace them. These compounds generally have lower [[bioconcentration factor]]s. However, there is evidence that large fluxes of these HpOCs into aquatic environments may be responsible for a number of adverse effects to aquatic organisms, such as altered behavior, [[neurotoxicity]], [[endocrine disruption]], and impaired reproduction.&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2007" /&gt; In the late 1990s research was underway to develop a new passive sampler in order to monitor HpOCs with a log Kow value of less than 3.&lt;ref name="Alvarez 2013" /&gt;  In 1999 the POCIS sampler was under development at the University of Missouri-Columbia. It gathered more support in the early 2000s as concern increased regarding the effects of [[environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products|pharmaceutical and personal care products]] in surface waters.&lt;ref name="Alvarez 2013" /&gt;
 
The [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) has been heavily involved in the development of passive samplers and has articles in their database regarding the development of POCIS as early as 2000. The USGS Columbia Environmental Research Center (CERC) is a self-proclaimed international leader in the field of passive sampling.&lt;ref name="USGS 2004"&gt;{{cite web|title=Passive Sampling|url=http://www.cerc.usgs.gov/Branches.aspx?BranchId=8|publisher=United States Geological Society (USGS) Columbia Environmental Research Center|accessdate=24 May 2014|date=May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been recent efforts by the USGS to connect people who have an interest in passive sampling. An international workshop and symposium on passive sampling was held by the USGS in 2013 to connect developers, policy makers and end users in order to discuss ways of monitoring environmental pollution.&lt;ref&gt;http://ipsw.eu/2013/ International Passive Sampling Workshop and Symposium (IPSW)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamentals==

The POCIS device was developed and patented by Jimmie D. Petty, James N. Huckins, and David A. Alvarez, of the Columbia Environmental Research Center.&lt;ref name="USGS 2004"/&gt; Integrative passive samplers are an effective way to monitor the concentration of organic contaminants in aquatic systems over time. Most aquatic monitoring programs rely on collecting individual samples, often called [[environmental monitoring#grab samples|grab samples]], at a specific time.&lt;ref name="Chimuka"&gt;Chimuka L, Cukrowska E. 2008. Monitoring of Aquatic Environments Using Passive Samplers. ''Open Analytical Chemistry Journal'' 2:1-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The grab sampling method is associated with many disadvantages that can be resolved by passive sampling techniques. When contaminants are present in trace amounts, grab sampling may require the collection of large volumes of water. Also, lab analysis of the sample can only provide a snapshot of contaminant levels at the time of collection. This approach therefore has drawbacks when monitoring in environments where water contamination varies over time and episodic contamination events occur.&lt;ref name="Alvarez 2013" /&gt; Passive sampling techniques have been able to provide a time-integrated sample of water contamination with low detection limits and in situ extraction of [[analyte]]s.&lt;ref name="Harman"&gt;Harman C, Allan IJ, Vermeirssen ELM. 2012. Calibration and Use of the Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler- A Critical Review. ''Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry'' 14:2724-2738.&lt;/ref&gt;

===POCIS set-up===

The POCIS sampler consists of an array of sampling disks mounted on a support rod. Each disk consists of a solid [[sorbent]] sandwiched between two polyethersoulfone (PES) [[microporous material|microporous]] membranes which are then compressed between two stainless steel rings which expose a sampling area.&lt;ref name="Harman" /&gt; A standard POCIS disk consists of a sampling surface area to sorbent mass ratio of approximately 180&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;g. Because the amount of chemical sampled is directly related to the sample surface area, it is sometimes necessary to combine extracts from multiple POCIS disks into one sample. Stainless steel rings, or other rigid inert material, are essential to prevent sorbent loss as the PES membranes are not able to be heat sealed.&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2007" /&gt; The POCIS array is then inserted and deployed within a protective canister. This canister is usually made of stainless steel or [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] and works to deflect debris that may displace the POCIS array during its deployment.&lt;ref name="ITRC 2006" /&gt;

The PES membrane acts as a [[semipermeable membrane|semipermeable]] barrier between the sorbent and surrounding aquatic environment. It allows dissolved contaminants to pass through the sorbent while selectively excluding any particles larger than 100&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2007" /&gt; The membrane resists [[biofouling]] because the polyethersulphone used in the design is less prone than other materials.&lt;ref name="ITRC 2006" /&gt; The POCIS is versatile in that the sorbents can be changed to target different classes of contaminants. However, only two sorbent classes are considered as standards of all POCIS deployments to date.&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2004" /&gt;

===Theory and modeling===

Each POCIS disk will sample a certain volume of water per day. The volume of water sampled varies from chemical to chemical and is dependent on the [[physical property|physical]] and [[chemical property|chemical]] properties of the compound as well as the duration of sampling. The sampling rate of POCIS can vary with changes in the water flow, turbulence, temperature, and the buildup of solids on the sampler’s surface.&lt;ref name="ITRC 2006" /&gt; The accumulation of contaminants into a POCIS device is the result of three successive process occurring at the same time. First, the contaminants have to diffuse across the water [[boundary layer]]. The thickness of this layer is dependent on water flow and turbulence around the sampler and can significantly alter sampling rates. Second, the contaminant must transport across the membrane either through the water-filled pores or through the membrane itself. Finally, contaminants transfer from the membrane into the sorbent material mainly through [[adsorption]]. These last two steps make the modeling, understanding, and prediction of accumulation by a POCIS device challenging. To date, a limited number of chemical sampling rates have been determined.&lt;ref name="Harman" /&gt;

Accumulation of chemicals by a POCIS device generally follows first order kinetics. The kinetics are characterized by an initial integrative phase, followed by an [[partition equilibrium|equilibrium partitioning]] phase. During the integrative phase of uptake, a passive sampling device accumulates residues linearly relative to time, assuming constant exposure concentrations. Based on current results, the POCIS sampler remains in a linear phase for at least 30 days, and has been observed up to 56 days. Therefore, both laboratory and field data justify the use of a linear uptake model for the calculation of sample rates.&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2007" /&gt; In order to estimate the ambient water concentration of contaminants sampled by a POCIS device, there must be available [[calibration]] data applicable for in situ conditions regarding the target compound. Currently, this information is limited.&lt;ref name="ITRC 2006" /&gt;

==Applicability==

POCIS can be deployed in a wide range of aquatic environments including stagnant pools, rivers, springs, [[estuary|estuarine]] systems, and [[wastewater]] streams.&lt;ref name="USGS 2004"&gt;http://www.cerc.usgs.gov/pubs/center/pdfdocs/pocis.pdf. United States Geological Society (USGS) Columbia Environmental Research Center. Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS)&lt;/ref&gt; However, there has been little research into the use of POCIS in strictly marine environments.&lt;ref name="Harman" /&gt; Prior to deployment of a POCIS device, it is essential to select a study site that will maximize the effectiveness of the sampler. Selecting an area that is shaded will help prevent light sensitive chemicals from being degrading. The site should also allow the sampler to be submerged in the water without being buried in the sediment.&lt;ref name="USGS 2004" /&gt; It is ideal to place the sampler in moving water in order to increase sampling rates, however, areas with an extremely turbulent water flow should be avoided as to prevent damage to the POCIS device. Passive samplers are very vulnerable to vandalism and it is therefore important to secure the sampler in areas that are not easily visible and that are away from areas frequently used by people.&lt;ref name="USGS 2004" /&gt;
 
POCIS samplers can be deployed for a period of time ranging from weeks to months. The shortest deployment lengths are typically 7 days but average 2–3 months.&lt;ref name="Harman" /&gt; It is important to have a long enough deployment period to allow for adequate detection of contaminants at ambient environmental concentrations. Often, the two different types of POCIS devices will be deployed together in order to provide the greatest understanding of contamination.&lt;ref name="Harman" /&gt; It is also important to deploy enough POCIS devices to ensure a large enough sample of contaminant is recovered for chemical analysis. An estimate or the number of samplers needed at a given site can be determined by the following equation.&lt;ref name="Alvarez 2010"&gt;Alvarez DA. 2010. Guidelines for the Use of the Semipermeable Membrane Device (SPMD) and the Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS) in Environmental Monitoring Studies.''Section D, Water Quality Book 1, Collection of Water Data by Direct Measurement.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relevant contaminants===

Any compound with a log Kow of less than or equal to 3 can concentrate in a POCIS sampler.&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2007" /&gt; Applicable classes of contaminants measured by POCIS are pharmaceuticals, household and industrial products, hormones, herbicides, and polar pesticides (Table 1). Currently, there are two POCIS configurations that are targeted for different classes of contaminants. A general POCIS design contains a sorbent that is used to collect pesticides, natural as well as synthetic hormones, and wastewater related chemicals. The pharmaceutical POCIS configuration contains a sorbent that is designed to specifically target classes of pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nemi.gov/methods/method_summary/10622/ National Environmental Methods Index (NEMI).

===POCIS processing===

Before the POCIS is constructed, all the hardware as well as the sorbents and membrane must be thoroughly cleaned so that any potential interference is removed. During and after sampling the only cleaning necessary is the removal of any sediment that has adhered to the surface of the sampler. After assembly, and prior to deployment, the samplers are stored in frozen airtight containers to avoid any contamination. The samplers should be kept in airtight containers during transportation both to and from the sampling site so that airborne contaminants do not contaminate the sampler. It is ideal to keep the samplers cold while transporting them in order to preserve the integrity of the samples.&lt;ref name="ITRC 2006" /&gt;

After the POCIS is retrieved from the field, the membrane is gently cleaned to reduce the possibility of any contamination to the sorbent.&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2007" /&gt; The sorbent is placed into a [[chromatography]] column so that the chemicals that samples can be recovered using an organic solvent. The solvent used is specifically chosen based on the type of sorbent and chemicals sampled. The sample can go through further processing such as cleanup or [[fractionation]] depending on the desired use of the sample.&lt;ref name="ITRC 2006" /&gt;

===Data analysis===

After the sample has been processed, the extract can be analysed using a variety of data analysis techniques.&lt;ref name="Harman" /&gt; The chemical analysis and analytical instrumentation used depends on the goal of the study. Many analyses require multiple samples, although in some cases a single POCIS sample can be used for multiple analyses.&lt;ref name="Alvarez 2010" /&gt;
  
It is vital to use [[quality control]] (QC) procedures when using passive samplers.&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2007" /&gt; It is common practice for 10% to 50% of the total number of samples to be used for QC purposes. The number of QC samples depends on the study objectives.&lt;ref name="Alvarez 2010" /&gt; The QC samples are used to address issues such as sample contamination and analyte recovery.&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2007" /&gt; The types of QC samples commonly used include; reagent blanks, field blanks, matrix spikes, and procedural spikes.&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2007" /&gt;

A large number of studies have been performed in which POCIS data was combined with  [[bioassay]]s to measure biological endpoints. Testing POCIS extracts in biological assays is useful as a POCIS device samples over its entire deployment period, and biologically active compounds can be effectively monitored. It can also be argued that the use of POCIS is a more relevant from an [[ecotoxicology|ecotoxicological]] perspective as the use of a passive sampler mimics the uptake of compounds by organisms. Another strength in using bioassays to test environmental samples is that they can provide an integrative measure of the toxic potential of a group of chemical compounds, rather than a single contaminant.&lt;ref name="Harman" /&gt;

==Other passive samplers==

There are many types of passive samplers used that specialize in absorbing different classes of aquatic contaminants found in the environment.&lt;ref name="ITRC 2006" /&gt; [[Chemcatcher]] and SMPD are two types of passive samplers that are also commonly used.&lt;ref name="Alvarez 2013" /&gt; Monitoring programs use SMPDs to measure to hydrophobic organic contaminants. SPMDs are designed to mimic the [[bioconcentration]] of contaminants in fatty tissues (ITRC, 2006). Contaminants applicable to the use of an SPMD include, but are not limited to, [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs), [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), [[organochloride|organochlorine]] pesticides, [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], and [[furans]].&lt;ref name="ITRC 2006" /&gt;
 
The SPMD consist of a thin-walled, [[nonporous]], [[polyethylene]] membrane tube that is filled with high molecular weight [[lipid]].&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2004" /&gt; These tubes are approximately 90&amp;nbsp;cm long and wrap around the inside of a stainless steel deployment canister.&lt;ref name="USGS 2004"&gt;http://www.cerc.usgs.gov/pubs/center/pdfdocs/pocis.pdf. United States Geological Society (USGS) Columbia Environmental Research Center. Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS)&lt;/ref&gt; SMPDs are efficient at absorbing pollutants with a log Kow of 4-8. This slightly overlaps with the range of contaminants absorbed by POCIS. Because of this, SMPDs and POCIS devices are often used together in monitoring studies to achieve a more representative understanding of contamination.&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2004" /&gt;

==Future development==

The POCIS system is continually evaluated for the potential to sample a wide range of contaminants. Calibration data and analyte recovery methods are currently being generated by researchers around the world. Techniques to merge the POCIS device with bioassays are also under development.&lt;ref name="ITRC 2006" /&gt; The POCIS sampler already serves as a versatile, economical, and robust tool for monitoring studies and observing trends in both space and time. However, sampling rates are not yet robust enough to supply reliable contaminant concentrations, particularly when regarding environmental quality standards.&lt;ref name="Harman" /&gt;  A limited number of sampling rates have been determined for chemicals and the determination of additional sampling rate data is necessary for the advancement of passive sampling technology.&lt;ref name="ITRC 2006" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42148">'''[[Public]]''' '''[[rhetoric]]''' refers to discourse both within a group of people and between groups, often centering on the process by which [[individual]] or group discourse seeks membership in the larger public discourse. Public rhetoric can also involve rhetoric being used within the general populace to foster social change and encourage [[agency (sociology)|agency]] on behalf of the participants of public rhetoric. The collective discourse between rhetoricians and the general populace is one representation of public rhetoric. A new discussion within the field of public rhetoric is digital space because the growing digital realm complicates the idea of private and public, as well as previously concrete definitions of discourse. Furthermore, scholars of public rhetoric often employ the language of [[tourism]] to examine how identity is negotiated between individuals and groups and how this negotiation impacts individuals and groups on a variety of levels, ranging from the local to the global.

== Public rhetoric participants ==
A '''public''', not to be confused with ''the'' public, is composed of members that address each other, are addressed as a group, and also subscribe to specific ideals. [[Michael Warner]] describes a public as “being self-organized, …a relationship among strangers …[where] merely paying attention can be enough to make [one] a member.”&lt;ref name="Warner"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Publics and counterpublics|last = Warner|first = Michael|date = 2002|journal = Public Culture|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = |pages = 49–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|56}} Robert Asen notes that identity formation of members of a public “entails mutual recognition among members of diverse cultures." &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Imagining the public sphere|last = Asen|first = Robert|date = 2002|journal = Philosophy and Rhetoric|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 35|issue = 4|page = |pages = 345–367}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|346}} To Warner, publics are a social space where information is exchanged and is required for the exchange of information.

=== Counterpublics ===
Within the public sphere, dominant publics exist whose discourse can subordinate other publics or exclude them from a related discourse. Counterpublics are the result of discourse and/or people feeling marginalized, ignored, inadequately voiced, or silenced within the public sphere. “Counterpublic refers to those publics that form through mutual recognition of exclusions in wider publics, set themselves against exclusionary wider publics, and resolve to overcome these exclusions,” writes Asen''.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|358}} Where dominant public groups typically manufacture heteronormative public spaces and discourse, counterpublics seek to insert or reinsert voices and perspectives of and from publics. Discourse then abnormalizes or even challenges dominant public rhetoric. Warner describes the facilities of counterpublic using the [[LGBT|LGBTQ+]] community:&lt;blockquote&gt;Within a gay or queer counterpublic, for example, no one is in the closet: the presumptive heterosexuality that constitutes the closet for individuals in ordinary speech is suspended. But this circulatory space, freed from heteronormative speech protocols, is itself marked by that very suspension: speech that addresses any participant as queer will circulate up to a point, at which it is certain to meet intense resistance. It might therefore circulate in special, protected venues, in limited publications. The individual struggle with stigma is transposed, as it were, to the conflict between modes of publicness. The expansive nature of public address will seek to keep moving that frontier for a queer public, to seek more and more places to circulate where people will recognize themselves in its address; but no one is likely to be unaware of the risk and conflict involved.&lt;ref name="Warner" /&gt;{{rp|86–87}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;As Asen furthers, “Individuals do not necessarily recognize exclusions and resolve to overcome them by virtue of their location in a social order.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|359}} Asen maintains that claiming a counterpublic of this form can diminish counterpublic forms to particular contributors who share specific interests with other members but might not consider each other as allies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|359}}

=== Subaltern and bourgeois groups ===
Amid publics and counterpublics, prevailing ideology, discourse, and images can create a hierarchy of group members and the rhetoric thereof. The struggle for political and social power within the public sphere between publics gives rise to dominant and weaker internal publics within a public, namely [[subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] and [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] publics, respectively. For example, in their article “Graffiti Hurts in the United States,” Terri Moreau and Derek H. Alderman describe an anti-graffiti task force, Graffiti Hurts, advocating for the eradication of urban graffiti in public spaces. This organization funded mural projects that would serve as a deterrent for would-be graffitists. While graffiti is often considered a lesser art form compared to the classical arts such as music, canvas painting, and sculpture, the mural projects “actually work to carry out a ‘normative’ prescription of landscape. The normalization has the ability to eradicate the potential for alternative constructions of public expression. As [Kurt] Iveson observes, ‘A legal mural might have some effect in making . . . people’s culture more visible in public space, but often this is on someone else’s’ terms.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Publics and the City|last = Iveson|first = Kurt|publisher = Blackwell|year = 2007|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Graffiti hurts and the eradication of alternative landscape expression|last = Moreau|first = Terri|date = 2011|journal = Geographical Review|doi = 10.1111/j.1931-0846.2011.00075.x|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Alderman|first2 = Derek H.|issue = 1|volume = 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|109}}  Keith Herring argues that the dominant images of a [[gay]] counterpublic produce “clones” representing “well-built,” effeminate, white males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Keith Haring and Queer Xerography|last = Herring|first = Scott|date = 2007|journal = Public Culture|doi = 10.1215/08992363-2006-03|pmid = |access-date = |pages = 329–348}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|333}} While [[Definitions of whiteness in the United States|whiteness]] is idealized, racial minority imagery and representation was and remains marginalized.

A bourgeois subgroup within a public is primarily composed of “private individuals…[that] do not ‘rule’.... Instead, their ideas infiltrated the very principle on which the existing power is based.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Public Sphere: An Encyclopedia Article|last = Habermas|first = Jürgen|date = 1974|journal = New German Critique|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = |pages = 49–55|editor-last = Lennox|editor-first = Sarah|editor2-last = Lennox|editor2-first = Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|51}} The bourgeois within a public represent a prevailing definition of the relevant publics and thereby control a greater degree of shared space for the related discourse between the larger public membership.

=== Strangers ===
'''Strangers''' are those who are not aware of their membership within a particular public. They are capable of being members of a public; however, they can also hold no opinion or in other ways pay no attention to their potential membership to a public. Strangers are normally not those who ignore their membership (which implies one is aware of being a member of a public). To Warner, without the presence of strangers in a public sphere, public discourse cannot occur because it is a requirement for public discourse to address strangers and provide them the awareness to identify themselves as an addressed public.&lt;ref name="Warner" /&gt;{{Rp|57}}

=== Orientation ===
Public rhetoric participants produce discourse relative to a larger conglomerate of people or publics. Within the public sphere, different publics engage their own or other publics in conversation creating discourse that affects their own and other groups through definition of public boundaries, redefining public structure, and dispersing related public ideology. For a person to produce public rhetoric, one would self-identify with a public.&lt;ref name="Warner" /&gt;{{Rp|3}} Media, culture, and geography are the more predominant orienting processes that channel people towards and away from specific publics. Through public rhetoric, publics can recruit strangers and embed or polarize members of the same or other publics. Political propaganda and product advertisement are two concrete examples of forces that orient strangers and publics through analog and digital media. When people engage in public discourse, “describ[ing] themselves and others, they do not engage in a value-neutral and transparent process. Rather, representational processes implicate participants in (often unacknowledged) choices regarding how people should be portrayed”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|10–11}} As one begins to form judgments regarding the image of a public, of a particular ideology, or of the protocols governing inclusion and exclusion in public discourse, that person then gains membership within a relevant public, thus becoming, in part, a representation of the whole image of said public.

How one is introduced to a public varies as existing knowledge and experience can augment how one perceives a public and public rhetoric. Tony Hiss points out how places can orient and disorient civilians. In his discussion, Hiss describes public parks as having the function of “changing the way we look at things, diffusing our attention and also relaxing its intensity…”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The experience of place: A new way of looking at and dealing with our radically changing cities and countryside|last = Hiss|first = Tony|publisher = Random House, Inc|year = 1991|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|34}} The geography of the park often contrasts the image of the city in which it exists. Effective entrance design for parks encourage visitors to enter, displacing prior experience in exchange for “park experience”, in a transition that navigates the visitors smoothly to and from the park experience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|42–44}} Similarly, when strangers are introduced to public discourse, orientation processes enable strangers to adopt and displace specific images of a public and evoke their membership to the new public.

== Rhetoric for public use ==
According to David J. Coogan and John M. Ackerman, “rhetoric is in the midst of discovering anew its usefulness.”&lt;ref&gt;Coogan &amp; Ackerman 2013, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[service-learning|service learning]] and [[civic engagement]] increase at colleges and universities, rhetoric begins the process of regrouping and becoming relevant in the community outside of the academy. In both the field of English and of communication, rhetoric’s reputation needs to be repaired and adapted to meet the needs of the general populace. In general, the public view of rhetoric is a negative one. It is the talk of politicians—filled with lies and manipulation. Instead, the public work of rhetoric should try to lead to social change. Scholars such as Ellen Cushman and Cynthia Sheard demonstrate this belief in their work; these and other scholars believe that rhetoricians should use their tools for the good of the public. In order to make this shift in rhetoric’s reputation, rhetoric needs a new set of guidelines by which to prepare rhetoricians to participate in social action.

=== Rhetoric in praxis as social action ===
Because rhetoric and composition are so closely related, the composition classroom becomes an open space for fostering social activism through service learning and allowing students to develop a sense of agency for both their scholarship and their interactions with the public. Ellen Cushman tells readers in her article “The Rhetorician as an Agent of Social Change” that “one way to increase our participation in public discourse is to bridge the university and community through activism. Given the role rhetoricians have historically played in the politics of their communities, [Cushman believes] modern rhetoric and composition scholars can be agents of social change outside the university.”&lt;ref name="Cushman 1996, p. 7"&gt;Cushman 1996, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Through their respective institutions, Cushman argues that both young and old scholars of rhetoric and composition can use their educational expertise to connect with the public outside of the university that, as scholars, they are typically estranged from. Because universities are often situated as counterpublics within the overall public of the geographic area in which they are located, it appears that scholars often feel prohibited from approaching and participating in the outside community.&lt;ref&gt;Cushman 1996, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to negate this feeling of being restricted from community engagement, Cushman urges members of the rhetoric and composition community at universities to participate in service learning.

=== Reciprocity from practicing rhetoric in public spaces ===
In an attempt to bridge the gap between the university and the community, Cushman suggests ways to “empower people in our communities, establish networks of reciprocity with them, and create solidarity with them.”&lt;ref name="Cushman 1996, p. 7"/&gt; In order to invent this network of reciprocity, Cushman urges rhetoricians and students within the university to venture outside of the boundaries of the institution, foster relationships with members of the community, and to perform work that benefits the community. Hopefully the scholar perceives a [[kairos|kairotic moment]] in which they come to an understanding of the relationship between the community and public rhetoric and are then, in turn, able to write and publish on their work. In essence, “[Cushman is] asking for a deeper consideration of the civic purpose of our positions in the academy, of what we do with our knowledge, for whom, and by what means.”&lt;ref&gt;Cushman 1996, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the reciprocity that inherently comes from performing social activism within the general community, engaging with those outside of academe allows scholars to improve the public’s general conception of rhetoric, thereby increasing the field's [[ethos]] in the eyes of the general public.

=== Reforming the public’s view of rhetoric ===
While the general populace currently views “doing rhetoric” as “menacing our fellow citizens with lies and misdirection,”&lt;ref&gt;Coogan &amp; Ackerman 2013, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; these devices have the ability to allow rhetoricians and social activists alike to bring about social change and repair rhetoric’s reputation in the eyes of the general populace. For example, in Cynthia Sheard’s article, “The Public Value of Epideictic Rhetoric,” she discusses how [[Epideictic|epideictic rhetoric]], which has traditionally elicited a negative public opinion, can be used to foster social change. Sheard calls rhetoricians to embrace a process of “[r]econceptualizing epideictic in order to emphasize . . . [i]ts close connection to the public sphere and its visionary quality . . . ”&lt;ref&gt;Sheard 1996, p. 770.&lt;/ref&gt; Sheard continues to explain that “epideictic discourse alters the reality in which it participates by making its vision a reality for its audience and instilling a belief that the power for realizing the vision lies with them.”&lt;ref&gt;Sheard 1996, p. 781.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sheard, this ability to alter the audience’s perception of reality, an ability that epideictic rhetoric was once criticized for, is exactly what gives this device the power to involve the general populace in social activism and persuade them to view rhetoric in a positive light instead of describing it as a manipulative device.

== Spaces ==
Spaces are the sites in which public rhetoric happens. These sites are not necessarily physical, geographically bound places, but metaphysical spaces in which discourse is shared and mediated by the members of specific publics.

=== Places vs. Spaces ===
To understand the spaces in which public rhetoric is enacted, it is important to understand the differences between “space” and “place.” In his book [[The Practice of Everyday Life]], [[Michel de Certeau]], defines places as an “instantaneous configuration of positions.” &lt;ref name="Certeau 1988, p. 117"&gt;Certeau 1988, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; To Certeau, places are geographically bound, locatable sites. These sites are defined by location and spatial relations to other places.

Certeau claims that places are different from spaces because places are “ultimately reducible to being there” while spaces are specified “by the actions of historical subjects.” &lt;ref name="Certeau 1988, p. 117"/&gt; While places could be pointed to on a map and are defined by what is physically inside of them, spaces are sites where things have happened. A space is defined by the interactions that individual agents have with it, not by its physical features. Certeau gives the examples that the place of a street becomes a space only when people walk on it and the places of texts only become spaces when people read them.&lt;ref name="Certeau 1988, p. 117"/&gt; When people engage in a discourse with a place, when they participate in public rhetoric there, it becomes a space.

=== Utopias and heterotopias ===
[[Michel Foucault]] built on Certeau’s definition of space in his essay, “Of Other Spaces: Utopias and Heterotopias,” pointing out that spaces were defined by “a set of relations that delineates sites which are irreducible to one another and absolutely not superimposable on one another.”&lt;ref name="Foucault 1986, p. 24"&gt;Foucault 1986, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that these individual, specific spaces could be placed in two main types: utopias and heterotopias.

==== Utopias ====
According to Foucault, [[utopias]] are spaces with no real place which present society in its perfected form.&lt;ref name="Foucault 1986, p. 24"/&gt; Since these spaces are not places that exist in reality, but rather as a result of the rhetoric that surrounds them, they are described as fundamentally unreal places.

==== Heterotopias ====
[[Heterotopia (space)|Heterotopias]] are real spaces that exist in every culture. Unlike Utopias, they are places that exist in physical space and can be indicated by their location. Foucault describes these heterotopias as “effectively enacted utopias in which the real sites, all the other real sites that can be found within the culture, are simultaneously represented, contested, and inverted.”&lt;ref name="Foucault 1986, p. 24"/&gt;  These heterotopic spaces transcend a single place as their value comes from the interactions that take place inside of them, but the fact that they are universally constructed and recognized allows for them to be pointed to geographically.

==== Middle spaces ====
Middle-spaces, according to David Coogan, are spaces in which rhetors from different publics can come and have an engaging discourse. As Coogan discusses, these are both physical and ideological places in which agents from two given publics c[an] come together to engage in discourse about “the ‘codes’ to evaluate conduct, entertain political possibilities, and in other ways arrange their affairs.”&lt;ref&gt;Coogan 2010, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; These spaces are especially conducive as places for counterpublics and publics to meet to question the commonplaces or ideological statements. In enacting discourse in middle spaces, counterpublic discourse can be heard and have influence on public discourse.

== Tourism as public rhetoric ==

In discussions of public rhetoric, tourism refers both to the act of traveling to a physical location in search of a transformative experience and to the metaphorical action of traveling into the experiential world of another. Public rhetoric scholars use the language of tourism to examine individuals and communities’ relationships to each other.

=== Identity politics ===

Scholars of public rhetoric frequently invoke the language of tourism to discuss individual and group identity. This is often done to disrupt notions of individuality. [[Jürgen Habermas]], for instance, chronicles the emergence of the concept of the individual in Western society, only to demonstrate the individual’s sublimation before the regulating function of the public sphere: “With the interweaving of the public and private realm, not only do the political authorities assume certain functions in the sphere of commodity exchange and social labor, but conversely social powers now assume political functions. This leads to a kind of ‘refeudalization’ of the public sphere.”&lt;ref&gt;Habermas 1964, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas’ concern for the political and social ramifications of individual versus public identity is one shared by other public rhetoric scholars.

=== Toxic tourism ===

Whereas the Western conception of the Subject tends to emphasize individual autonomy, scholars of public rhetoric challenge the notion that individual identity exists separately from the surrounding world. This challenge to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] notions of identity is exemplified by the work of [[Phaedra Pezzullo]]. In ''Toxic Tourism'', Pezzullo argues that tourism as practice has the potential to help bridge the divide between Subject and Object by facilitating interaction on a multi-sensory level. Pezzullo suggests that embracing tourism’s ability to engage all of the body’s senses “may help those of us who study tourism to become more reflexive about our own culpability in privileging and, thus, perpetuating oppressive and colonial sensibilities.”&lt;ref&gt;Pezzullo 2007, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The language of interconnection and responsibility pervades public rhetoric’s concern with tourism as a process that mediates relationships between human beings.

Researchers such as Pezzullo have discussed the large extent that notions of toxicity are reflected in the ways that certain groups are marginalized. For instance, Pezzullo writes “that the ‘toxic baggage’ the nation carries exceeds the material impact of toxins and public discourses about them. It includes our cultural perceptions of our bodies and the bodies of ‘polluted’ and ‘polluting’ Others.”&lt;ref&gt;Pezzullo 2007, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the language of toxicity is not limited to describing polluted areas or even victims of pollution. Toxicity is used to identify and rhetorically isolate segments of the population that do not conform to the Public’s normative expectations. Yet, as Pezzullo also suggests, the practice of tourism allows for travel between the Public and those citizens and groups who stand outside it. Pezzullo suggests that toxic tours, for instance, stand to allow the marginalized and often ignored Other to “look back” at the tourist who is experiencing the toxic area.&lt;ref&gt;Pezzullo 2007, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of becoming the Object of the Other’s gaze raises the possibility that the tourist’s perspective on the Other may be altered in the exchange, thus raising the possibility that the practice of tourism can induce transformation in the tourist.

=== Tourism and publics ===

Taken in a broad sense, the practice of tourism enables interactions that allow for the formation and maintenance of publics. Tourism as a concept does not merely connote the movement of bodies from one physical place to another; it also refers to the internalization and externalization of ideas. As Michael Warner indicates, the ability to exchange ideas is what enables the participatory creation of the public sphere and is, therefore, a source of great power: “Speaking, writing, and thinking involve us-actively and immediately-in a public, and thus in the being of the sovereign. Imagine how powerless people would feel if their commonality and participation were simply defined by pre-given frameworks, by institutions and law, as in other social contexts it is defined through kinship. . . . Such is the image of totalitarianism.”&lt;ref&gt;Warner 2002, p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt; Examined as an exchange of ideas, the practice of tourism allows individuals to engage in discourse with other individuals, thereby creating publics.

Key to Warner and other scholars’ understanding of publics is the notion of voluntary participation. The citizen-tourist must willingly encounter the perspectives of other citizens. In this sense, public-creating tourist practices are not limited to “the pundits and wonks and reaction-shot secondary celebrities who try to perform our publicness for us . . . [, but include]  people whose place in public media is one of consuming, witnessing, griping, or gossiping rather than one of full participation, or fame.”&lt;ref name="Warner 2002, p. 415"&gt;Warner 2002, p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; Warner goes on to state that, “a public can only produce a sense of belonging and activity if it is self-organized through discourse rather than through an external framework.”&lt;ref name="Warner 2002, p. 415"/&gt; Just as the tourist who travels to a different geographic area chooses to do so, a choice that invites the possibility of being transformed by the experience, the citizen-tourist must choose to engage in discourse with other citizens in order for that exchange to create and maintain a public.

==Birthplaces of public rhetoric: The street &amp; the riot==
In its most organic form, the discourse of the public sphere arises spontaneously. In his seminal work [http://unige.ch/sciences-societe/socio/files/2914/0533/6073/Habermas_1974.pdf “The Public Sphere: An Encyclopedia Article”] Habermas discusses the bourgeois public as an instrumental development in the history of publics but recognizes the limitations of the bourgeois public for modernity: “Although the liberal model of the public sphere is still instructive today with respect to the normative claim that information be accessible to the public, it cannot be applied to the actual conditions of an industrially advanced mass democracy…”.&lt;ref name="Habermas 1964, p. 54"&gt;Habermas 1964, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the modern state limits the ability of the democratic populace to truly engage in a conversation of public rhetoric. Thus, instead of self-regulating, many of the public’s demands need to be met by the state, which could not please everyone on such a large scale. When these needs are not met, the scale of the democracy requires a dramatic catalyst to bridge the distance between the citizens and bring to light the need for change.&lt;ref name="Habermas 1964, p. 54" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The most basic (albeit violent) form of public would be that of the riot, which is engendered by “competitions of interest, competitions which assume the form of violent conflicts.”&lt;ref name="Habermas 1964, p. 54"&gt;Habermas 1964, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this public is less civilized and perfect than is desirable, the spontaneity and power of riots and civil unrest—which Habermas refers to as “the street”—often affect change, as has been demonstrated throughout modern history time and time again. Without any sort of organized formation, the riot embodies the public sphere; the citizenry reacts to an issue with an outburst of the same opinion (one they may not realize they shared) and has thus created a publicly driven rhetorical discourse surrounding the issue.

The riot is organic; often considered barbaric or savage because of the raw emotions involved. Cynthia Sheard claims that it is a result of “the ways in which words fail us… all-too-common images of violence must make us wonder, indeed, whether words can make any difference in our lives.”&lt;ref&gt;Sheard 1996, p. 765.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the riot may have devastating consequences, it is purposeful in its ability to create recognition of a problem across a nation, bridging the gaps of class and distance the issue may otherwise find insurmountable. For example, the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement is now global due to the riots following the kairotic police [[shooting of Michael Brown]] in Ferguson, MO. Many of those who have never before been affected by police violence towards black males have now seen the movement “in their own backyards,” and protests have arisen across the country, while both the mainstream and social media coverage of Ferguson has enabled this issue to be prescient in the minds of many far-removed citizens.

== Digital public ==
A digital public can be considered as a few different entities. According to Patricia G. Lange, a digital space is a [[social network]], or a group of people related to each other in some way.&lt;ref&gt;Lange 2008, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; Digital social networks in which knowledge is communicated and shared have been labeled “epistemopolis.”&lt;ref name="Barron &amp; Gruber 2011, p. 155"&gt;Barron &amp; Gruber 2011, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; An epistemopolis facilitates the growth of communities in a specific space around a specific topic.&lt;ref name="Barron &amp; Gruber 2011, p. 155"/&gt; These digital social spaces are complicated by the possibility of anyone in the world being related to anyone else in the world in any given way at any given time; measurements or regulations or requirements for defining a specific digital space would need to be applied on an individual basis. While this isn’t necessarily up for debate in fields that study digital realms, it does present challenges for public rhetoric because it  provides a more complex, tangled conception of a public.

A digital space can take any of a variety of forms: chat rooms, social media networks, blogs, private journals, news sites, question and answer forums, professional marketing pages, online shopping sites, etc. Additionally, digital space allows for cultural interaction in a way that is not possible in [[analog signal|analog device]] spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Poster 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that the internet is a social construction, designed for social interaction among various contexts (including economic, discursive, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Silver 2005, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, digital spaces can be manipulated, adapted, or even created for different, specific functions. Consider [[Wikipedia]]: “the free encyclopedia anyone can edit.” This site encourages individuals to share more information, making verified knowledge public and collaborative. Another example is Douglas Eyman's text [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?cc=dh;c=dh;idno=13030181.0001.001;rgn=full%20text;view=toc;xc=1;g=dculture|Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice]. Eyman wrote a print and a digital version of this text and includes a statement encouraging readers to take, revise, reuse, and [[Digital rhetoric#Circulation|circulate]] his original text, which is why he made the book available for free online.

=== Public Rhetoric in the Digital Realm ===
The digital sphere presents a new set of challenges for public rhetoric. With issues of authorship, [[autonomy]], and anonymity, the field crosses back and forth constantly between private and public. Individuals can create a digital persona, an [[digital rhetoric#Avatars|avatar]], while keeping their actual identity a secret. It is relatively easy to steal content and present it as your own (leading to copyright and plagiarism issues). To a certain extent, “technology has fused with human consciousness itself,”&lt;ref&gt;Ong 1980, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a collective, shared, public memory.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Many people may oppose or feel threatened by advancements in technology, especially the internet. Some question personal and financial safety, a fear that may be heard as part of the argument opposing use of digital spaces. Opportunities for extended communication, in a plethora of different ways, litter the argument for development of digital spaces and tools. For example, digital [[social activism]] (also referred to as [[internet activism]] or cyberactivism) is a growing movement that uses digital spaces to spread awareness and encourage action regarding various topics.&lt;ref&gt;McCaughey &amp; Ayers 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Analog spaces tend to allow for a smaller audience than digital spaces, and therefore (typically) results in less action.

[[Digital rhetoric]] is important to consider when thinking about digital publics. Individuals create online identities, influencing how a digital audience can be addressed. This in turn influences how the author uses [[Digital rhetoric#Canons|the rhetorical canons]] in their composition.

== The photographic image as an icon ==
Photographic images can function in public rhetoric as [[Cultural icon|icons]] of U.S. public culture. According to [[Robert Hariman]] and [[John Lucaites|John Louis Lucaites]] in ''No Caption Needed: Iconic Photographs, Public Culture, and Liberal Democracy'', iconic images “work in several registers of ritual and response.”&lt;ref name="Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 1"&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Public interpretations and influences of iconic photographic images manifest themselves as visual representations, or delivery of rhetoric. How these images function in public depends on the features of the specific image, the motivation for the image, and the responses from the public sphere.

=== What makes an icon an icon? ===
While multiple interpretations of photographic images as icons are discussed in conversations of public rhetoric, establishing what makes an icon an icon is important in order to identify and further analyze icons’ functions. Hariman and Lucaites describe the seven characteristics of an icon as follows:

# is easily recognized by many people of varied backgrounds;
# is an object of veneration and other complex emotional responses;
# is reproduced widely and placed prominently in both public and private settings;
# is used to orient the individual [viewer] within a context of collective identity, obligation, and power;
# represents large swaths of historical experience and acquires its own history of appropriation and commentary;
# stands above the welter of news, debates, decisions, and investigations; and/or
# bears witness to something that exceeds words.&lt;ref name="Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 1"/&gt;
If a photographic image holds one or more of the above-mentioned characteristics, it is considered an icon and fulfills several important functions in public rhetoric.

=== Functions of photographic icons in  public life ===
As a version of public rhetoric, iconic images serve to compose meaning and persuade a public audience to respond in some way. According to Hariman and Lucaites, “each image presents a pattern of motivation that can make some responses more likely than others.”&lt;ref&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; An iconic image [[semiotically]] promotes an interpretation by its audience that is by no means incumbent on the specific image, but likely will create a realm of similar meanings more frequently than others. Five vectors of influence are identified for iconic photographs: “reproducing [[ideology]], communicating social knowledge, shaping collective [[Memoria|memory]], modeling citizenship, and providing figural resources for communicative action.”&lt;ref&gt;Hariman and Lucaites 2007, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reproducing ideology ====
Iconic images have the capability of representing [[ideology]], which Hariman and Lucaites define as “a set of beliefs that presents a social order as if it were a natural order, that presents asymmetrical relationships as if they were mutually beneficial, and that makes authority appear self-evident.”&lt;ref&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; A photograph has the power to create such public meaning that can manipulate order, relationships, and authority as part of reproducing ideology.

==== Communicating social knowledge ====
Because icons are distinctively public visual images, they “recast social knowledge with regard to the distinctive concerns and roles of public life.”&lt;ref&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; By tapping into the knowledge of the public to which they are being presented, icons effectively persuade members of a society and their social interactions, as any successful rhetoric does. Photographs can communicate social knowledge because they are accepted as representations of social performance.

==== Shaping collective memory ====
Photographic icons can negotiate collective memory as part of the social knowledge it communicates. An icon can shape public understanding of specific events and contexts at the kairotic time of their occurrence and thereafter. Thus, society as a whole acts as the audience of the rhetorical message sent about the time the photograph was taken. Hariman and Lucaites contend, “the more collective memory is constructed through the visual media, the more likely it is that the iconic photos will be used to mark, frame, and otherwise set the tone for later generations’ understanding of public life”&lt;ref&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; in the specific time period.

==== Modeling citizenship ====
Members of the public interpreting iconic images can themselves be shaped by the messages sent by the icons, as can their [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizomatic]] relationships with each other. When viewing icons that portray U.S. citizens, the audience sees themselves in those citizens and emulates their portrayal of society. Iconic images essentially “display the public to themselves.”&lt;ref&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Providing figural resources for communicative action ====
Since society can be considered “abstract” in terms of relationships between citizens, photographs serve to communicate such ambiguous citizenship and supply models for how to be a “good citizen.” Hariman and Lucaites explain that “an iconic photograph can continue to shape public understanding and action long after the event has passed or the crisis has been resolved pragmatically.”&lt;ref&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The collective memory formed by iconic photographs inspire action to perform as a moral citizen and motivate public response.

The '''RealDoll''' is a life-size [[sex doll]] (also considered a [[mannequin]]) manufactured by Abyss Creations, LLC in [[San Marcos, California]], and sold worldwide.  It has a poseable [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] skeleton with steel joints and [[silicone]] flesh.

==Details and history==
The RealDolls are designed to recreate the appearance, texture, and weight of the human female and male form. Their primary function is to serve as [[sex partner]]s. This activity can be accompanied by certain preparations such as dressing them up in different types of clothing, changing wigs or makeup, and even adjusting body temperature by use of electric blankets or baths.

Early prototypes were made from solid [[latex]] with an [[Endoskeleton|interior]] [[Human skeleton|skeleton]], but construction of the outer material was later switched to [[silicone]]. In June 2009, Abyss Creations switched from tin cure silicone to platinum silicone, which resulted in dolls that are less prone to tears and compression marks than older RealDolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doll Street Journal |url=http://www.realdoll.com/cgi-bin/snav.rd?action=viewnewsletter&amp;volume=200907 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804200602/http://www.realdoll.com/cgi-bin/snav.rd?action=viewnewsletter&amp;volume=200907 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-08-04 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;  

The current incarnation of the female RealDoll product was introduced in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official RealDoll website|url=http://www.realdoll.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Abyss introduced the "Face-X" system, allowing any face to be interchangeable with any body. Multiple faces can then be attached one at a time to a single doll by the owner.  As of 2011, there are nine female bodies and 16 female faces in the first product line. In 2009 the RealDoll&amp;nbsp;2 was introduced, which feature removable inserts for the [[Mouth#In humans|mouth]] and [[vagina]] and faces that attach by magnets instead of Velcro.  The line started with two female bodies and three female faces and as of 2013 offers ten faces and three bodies. Another female body is in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doll Forum Announcement|url=http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=89&amp;t=37588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Charlie", the first male RealDoll, was retired in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abyss News Page |url=http://www.realdoll.com/cgi-bin/snav.rd?action=viewpage&amp;section=viewnewsarticle&amp;newsnumberentry=2008051602 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331041052/http://www.realdoll.com/cgi-bin/snav.rd?action=viewpage&amp;section=viewnewsarticle&amp;newsnumberentry=2008051602 |archivedate=2012-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced with two body types and three head types. "[[Transgender]]" dolls may also be purchased from the company, although these must be custom ordered. Abyss also sells silicone toys such as female torso products and dildos among other offerings.

For a time, the company also offered customizations such as robotic hip actuators, finger skeletons (instead of the usual finger wires) and computer-controlled speech feedback, but these expensive options are no longer available.

'''Sensate focus''' is a [[sex therapy]] technique introduced by the [[Masters and Johnson]] team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Wiley Handbook of Sex Therapy|last=Avery-Clark|first=Constance|last2=Weiner|first2=Linda|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2017|isbn=9781118510407|location=New York, NY|pages=165-189}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It works by refocusing the participants on their own [[sensory perception]]s and [[sensuality]], instead of goal-oriented behavior focused on the genitals and penetrative sex. 
Sensate focus has been used to treat problems with body image, erectile dysfunction, orgasm disorders, and lack of sexual arousal.&lt;ref&gt;Binik, Y. M., &amp; Hall K. S. K. (Eds.) (2014). ''Principles and practice of sex therapy (5th ed.).'' NY: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
The exercises are conducted by the couple at home, between therapy sessions.  Although the couple are nude and touching each other during the exercises, they are instructed to abstain from [[sexual intercourse]] during or close to the sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sensate Focus in Sex Therapy: The Illustrated Manual|last=Weiner|first=Linda|last2=Avery-Clark|first2=Constance|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781138642355|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Van Hasselt | first = Vincent B. |author2=Michel Hersen  | title = Sourcebook of psychological treatment manuals for adult disorders | publisher = Springer | year = 1996 | pages = 348–351 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=00l25ZZB9LoC&amp;pg=PA349&amp;dq=Sensate+focusing&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=Sensate%20focusing&amp;f=false | isbn = 978-0-306-45144-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both participants are instructed instead to focus on their own varied [[sense]] [[experience]], instead of focussing on performance or [[orgasm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Methodological issues in the study of sex therapy: effective components in the treatment of secondary orgasmic dysfunction.|date = 1983|publisher = Journal of sex and marital therapy|last = Fichten|first = C.S.|last2 = Libman|first2 = E.|last3 = Brender|first3 = W.|pmid=6631977|doi=10.1080/00926238308405847|volume=9|journal=J Sex Marital Ther|pages=191-202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Prescribing sensate focus without proscribing intercourse.|date = Summer 1987|journal = Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy|last = Lipsius|first = S.H.|pmid=3612821|doi=10.1080/00926238708403883|volume=13|pages=106-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the emphasis is on touching in a [[Mindfulness|mindful]] way for oneself without regard for sexual response or pleasure for oneself or one’s partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Avery-Clark|first2=Constance|year=2014|title=Sensate Focus: Clarifying the Masters and Johnson's model|url=|journal=Sexual and Relationship Therapy|volume=29|issue=3|pages=307–319|doi=10.1080/14681994.2014.892920|via=|last1=Weiner|first1=Linda}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Cannon|first2=Neil|last3=Avery-Clark|first3=Constance|year=2014|title=Reclaiming the lost art of Sensate Focus: A clinician's guide|url=http://www.sextherapiststlouis.com/files/SensateFocusOnly.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Family Therapy Magazine|volume=13|issue=5|pages=46–48|via=|last1=Weiner|first1=Linda}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
A [[sex therapist]] will usually guide the timing and technique of the sensate focusing. In the first stage, the couple may touch each other's [[Human body|bodies]] excluding breasts and genitals.  They are encouraged to enjoy and become increasingly aware of the warmth, texture and other qualities of their partner's [[skin]].  Participants attend to whatever they find interesting in each other, rather than attend to what they think the other wants.

Contact with the breasts, or male or female genitalia is banned at least for the first initial session, but other aspects of intimacy are explored: [[Physical intimacy|touching]], [[Conversation|talking]], [[hug]]ging, [[kiss]]ing, and so on.  This includes taste, smell, and sound, as partners are encouraged to talk to each other, to express [[emotion]], and to encourage each other.

The aim here is to minimize pressure and expectations, and to appreciate new sensual possibilities. Patients often report an improvement in their sex life generally with less anxiety.  As the man reports increasing awareness and attention paid to these holistic sense aspects of sex, potency often returns.  This works well for women too. Women report more sensation in their vagina, and lubrication.

The second stage increases the [[touch]] options to include breasts. Sensation and gathering information about the partner's body is still encouraged and intercourse and touching of the genitals is still forbidden. The participants then use a technique of placing their hand over their partner's hand in order to show what they find pleasurable in terms of pace and pressure. Learning about the partner's body is still the goal rather than pleasure.  Further stages gradually re-introduce touching of breasts and genitals, then intercourse.  Orgasm is never the focus.

This is also used as a treatment for [[impotence]] in males, and arousal difficulties especially where [[anxiety]] is involved.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, S. B. (1992). Intrapsychich and interpersonal aspects of impotence: Psychogenic erectile dysfunction. In R. C. Rosen &amp; S. R. Leiblum (Eds.), Erectile disorders: Assessment and treatment (pp. 198-225). NY: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of performance anxiety in men, the obsessional focus on the penis can result in impotence. The therapist will encourage the man to forget about his penis, and forget about his partner's genitals, and instead concentrate on the sensual possibilities available in the feel of his own and his partner's [[skin]], [[hair]], [[mouth]], [[Human body|body]], ([[breast]]s), etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1596">The term '''''seriation''''' [mise en série] was proposed for use in [[semiotics]] by [[Jean Molino]] and derived from classical [[philology]]. Seriation "invokes the idea that any investigator, in order to assign some plausible meaning to a given phenomenon, must interpret it within a ''series'' of comparable phenomena." One cannot interpret what philology calls a ''hapax''; that is, an isolated phenomenon. Art historian Erwin Panofsky has explained the situation in very clear terms:
*'Whether we deal with historical or natural phenomena, the individual observation of phenomena assumes the character of a 'fact' only when it can be related to other, analogous observations in such a way that the whole series 'makes sense.' This 'sense' is, therefore, fully capable of being applied, as a control, to the interpretation of a new individual observation within the same range of phenomena. If, however, this new individual observation definitely refuses to be interpreted according to the 'sense' of the series, and if an error proves to be impossible, the 'sense' of the series will have to be reformulated to include the new individual observation' (1955, p.&amp;nbsp;35)" (1990, pp.&amp;nbsp;230–231).

A seriation is determined by the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]].

'''Southern Illinois University Carbondale''' ('''SIUC''') is a public research university in [[Carbondale, Illinois]], United States. Founded in 1869, SIUC has historically been the largest of the campuses of the [[Southern Illinois University]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icpn.museum.state.il.us/institution/morris-library-southern-illinois-university-carbondale|title=Morris Library at Southern Illinois University-Carbondale|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university enrolls students from all 50 states as well as more than 100 countries. SIU Carbondale offers 3 associate's, 100 bachelor's, 73 master's, and 36 Ph.D programs in addition to professional degrees in architecture, law and medicine.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irs.siu.edu/_common/documents/factbook17.pdf|title=Factbook 2016-2017|last=|first=|date=|website=irs.siu.edu|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://catalog.siu.edu/programs/index.php|title=Undergraduate Programs {{!}} 2017-2018 Academic Catalog {{!}} SIU|website=2017-2018 Academic Catalog|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gradschool.siu.edu/academics/|title=Degree Programs {{!}} Graduate School {{!}} SIU|website=Graduate School|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Pulliamclocktower.jpg|thumb|The Pulliam Hall clock tower has a carillon that is regularly played. This landmark tower has been incorporated into the logo of Southern Illinois University Carbondale.]]
[[File:Pulliam Hall (SIU).JPG|thumb|SIU Pulliam Hall during sunset]]

An Act of the Twenty-sixth General Assembly of Illinois, approved March 9, 1869, created '''Southern Illinois Normal College,''' the second state-supported [[normal school]] in Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Howard, ''Illinois: A History of the Prairie State'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1972), 341.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carbondale held the ceremony of cornerstone laying, May 17, 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, Eli G. (1955). ''Seventy-Five Years in Retrospect'', Carbondale, IL.: Southern Illinois University. pp. 11-13&lt;/ref&gt; The first historic session of Southern Illinois Normal University was a summer institute, with a first faculty of eight members and an enrollment of 53 students.&lt;ref&gt;"Southern Illinois University: the First Seventy-Five Years." ( Jan 1949). [http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=ua_docs]&lt;/ref&gt;

The university continued primarily as a teacher's college until [[Delyte W. Morris]] took office as president of the university in 1948. Morris was SIU's longest-serving president (1948–1970).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19991010060656/http://www.dailyegyptian.com/fall98/delytemorris/]&lt;/ref&gt; During his presidency, Morris transformed SIU, adding Colleges of Law, Medicine and Dentistry. Since World War II, higher education has been emphasized as a goal for more students. Southern Illinois University grew rapidly in size from 3,500 to over 24,800 students between 1950 and 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egyptianaaa.org/SI-History3.htm/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328072315/http://www.egyptianaaa.org/SI-History3.htm/|date=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, a second campus of SIU was established at Edwardsville.  This school, now known as [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]], is an independent university within the SIU system.

== Leadership ==
[[Randy Dunn]] was the eighth president of the Southern Illinois University System. Dr. Dunn served as president at two other state institutions and was the state superintendent of education, appointed to that role by the Illinois State Board of Education. His career in education includes classroom teaching, serving as principal at two school districts, serving as superintendent for two Illinois school systems, and holding the rank of professor at two universities including SIUC. Dr. Dunn has served on a number of committees, councils and task forces, and he contributes to a variety of scholarly publications. 
Dunn received his doctorate in educational administration from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1991.  He graduated from Illinois State University with a master's in administration and foundations in 1983, and the B.S. in education in 1980.
Before coming to Southern Illinois, he served as president at two other state institutions — Murray State University in Kentucky (2006-2013) and Youngstown State University in Ohio (2013-2014).  Before that, Dunn was the state superintendent of education, appointed to that role by the Illinois State Board of Education.  He is not a stranger to the SIU System, having held the rank of professor in the Department of Educational Administration and Higher Education at SIUC.  Dunn started at the Carbondale campus as an associate professor in 1995 and was named department chair in 2000, before leaving to assume the state superintendency.  During his term as chair, he also taught in the joint doctoral program in educational leadership at SIU Edwardsville.  Dunn began his academic career as an assistant professor in the Department of Leadership at The University of Memphis for two years before taking his faculty post at Southern Illinois University.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siusystem.edu/president/index.shtml |title=SIU President |publisher=Siusystem.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018 Randy Dunn stepped down as SIU system president, and was replaced by J. Kevin Dorsey, as interim president. Dorsey was the former dean of the SIU school of medicine.

Carlo Montemagno, a professor of engineering, became chancellor of SIU Carbondale on August 15, 2017. His appointment was approved by the university's Board of Trustees July 13, 2017, at the recommendation of SIU System President Randy Dunn.Dr. Montemagno is an internationally recognized expert in nanotechnology and biomedical engineering, focusing his work on linking multiple disciplines to solve problems in areas of health, energy and the environment. Prior to his appointment at SIU, he founded the interdisciplinary Ingenuity Lab based at the University of Alberta in Canada. In addition to leading the lab, which connects organizations and researchers from across the Province of Alberta, he served as director of the biomaterials program for the Canadian Research Council's National Institute for Nanotechnology as well as research chair in intelligent nanosystems for the Canadian National Research Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chancellor.siu.edu/|title=Chancellor {{!}} Southern Illinois University|website=Chancellor|language=en|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Southern Illinois Salukis}}
The '''Southern Illinois Salukis''' are the athletic teams representing Southern Illinois University Carbondale. The university first sponsored athletic teams during the 1913–14 school year, when they were known as the "Maroons." Students and faculty began lobbying for a new mascot during the late 1940s. On March 19, 1951, the student body voted to change the official nickname to the Salukis. The [[saluki]], the royal dog of ancient Egypt, was chosen as the mascot due to its reputation as a fast and tenacious hunter and because the southern Illinois region is known as "[[Little Egypt (region)|Little Egypt]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siusalukis.cstv.com/ot/saluki-mascot.html |title=Southern Illinois Official Athletic Site – Athletics |publisher=Siusalukis.cstv.com |date=March 19, 1951 |accessdate=January 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708212123/http://siusalukis.cstv.com/ot/saluki-mascot.html |archivedate=July 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Salukis sponsor 16 varsity teams. Most compete in the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] (MVC), specifically in men's and women's basketball, men's and women's cross country, men's and women's golf, softball, women's swimming, men's and women's tennis, men's and women's track and field, and volleyball. The football program competes in the [[Missouri Valley Football Conference]] (MVFC). Men's swimming is part of the [[Mid-American Conference]] (MAC).

=== Cardboard Boat Regatta ===
[[File:Siucampus lake.JPG|thumb|Sunset over Southern Illinois University's Campus Lake.]]
The Cardboard Boat Regatta is an event held every spring semester at Campus Lake. Participants include university students and community members both young and old. The goal is to complete three trips around a 200-yard course on the lake using makeshift cardboard boats. There are three different categories for entries: canoes or kayaks, experimental boats and instant boats (boats created on-site the day of the event).

The idea for a Cardboard Regatta first originated in 1974 at Southern Illinois University. Richard Archer, a professor of Art and Design, dreamed up a final examination for students in his freshman design class. [[Buckminster Fuller]], then a Distinguished Professor at SIU, had espoused the principle of "doing the most with the least," and faculty members found it intriguing to apply these principles in their classes. Archer felt it would be a real test of students' creativity and three-dimensional design skills to build human-sized boats made only of cardboard, and more than 40 years later, it is still happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gcbr.com/faqs.html|title=The Great Cardboard Boat Regatta FAQs|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160211185621/http://www.gcbr.com/faqs.html|archivedate=2016-02-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many communities, organizations and other universities around the country have joined in on the fun and now organize their own Cardboard Boat Regattas.

'''Sustainable automotive air conditioning''' is the subject of a debate – nicknamed the ''Cool War'' – about the next-generation [[refrigerant]] in car [[air conditioning]]. The '''Alliance for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Solutions''' supports the uptake of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a refrigerant in passenger cars, and the chemical industry is developing new chemical blends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliance-co2-solutions.org/docs/the_choice.pdf The Choice Today - New Chemical Blends or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alliance and its supporters – scientists, [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and business leaders – urge the car industry to replace high global warming chemical substances with the [[natural refrigerant]] [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[R744]]/ R-744) in car cooling and heating. This, they argue, would lead to 10% less car emissions, and knock out 1% of total [[greenhouse gas]] emissions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliance-co2-solutions.org/docs/challenge.pdf Car Air Conditioning &amp; the Climate Change Challenge - Made Simple]&lt;/ref&gt; If CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Technology is applied in other sectors, such as commercial and industrial refrigeration, heat pumps for water heating etc., it may even save up to 3% of the world’s greenhouse gases.

Opponents of the Alliance claim that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Technology is not cost-efficient and safe, hence seeking to postpone the global industry decision to be taken to develop new chemical blends instead.

==Background==
The Cool War has emanated from the decision of the European Union to phase out the current high global warming refrigerant [[HFC-134a]] in car air conditioning from January 2011 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/l_161/l_16120060614en00120018.pdf European Directive 2006/40/EC relating to emissions from air-conditioning systems in motor vehicles]&lt;/ref&gt; To comply with the legislation, carmakers have to decide today on a new refrigerant, as they typically need 3–4 years to develop and introduce a new car platform including the air conditioning system. (It would take much less time to design merely a new air conditioning system to install in a new version of an existing model.) The current total value of the car air conditioning market is estimated to be $14.5 billion in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A shift in car air conditioning technology – Carbon Dioxide Refrigerant|url=http://www.autoairconparts.co.uk/blog/a-shift-in-car-air-conditioning-technology-carbon-dioxide-refrigerant/|publisher=www.autoairconparts.co.uk|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments==

===Arguments for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===
The Alliance for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Solutions and its supporters agree that the refrigerant CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is:

*More environmentally friendly with the lowest [[Global warming potential]] (GWP) of all currently used and proposed refrigerants. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; does not deplete the ozone layer. Since the carbon dioxide used in car air conditioning is a recycled industrial waste product it becomes environmentally neutral.  Overall, using a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based air conditioning system will reduce total car emissions by 10%, thereby sparing the planet 1% of total greenhouse gases.{{cn|date=February 2016}}
*More technically ready because CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; models have been developed and tested in all climates, being now ready for mass production. They are faster to heat and cool a car, and show a superior performance in over 90% of all driving conditions.
*More cost-efficient because as a refrigerant itself, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is cheap and worldwide available. The servicing of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; systems will be less costly and less complicated than that for present systems. For the consumer the total cost of ownership is lowest with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as it will significantly cut fuel consumption by the air conditioning device. Carmakers have to make an initial investment estimated at €20 per unit, with no additional costs once CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Technology enters into mass production.
*Usable in Heat Pumps because at least one CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system under development can act as a [[heat pump]], supplying cabin heat and windshield defrosting even before the engine has warmed up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visteon.com/company/features/081604.html Visteon's R744 system] {{cite web | url=http://www.visteon.com/company/features/081604.html | title=Feature Stories-Company-R744 Climate System | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114205439/http://visteon.com/company/features/081604.html | archivedate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Although the Alliance may not mention it, since CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is so cheap and relatively harmless to the environment, the reservoirs in such systems could store additional liquid R744 to keep a vehicle cool even when the engine (or compressor) was not running.

===Arguments against CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===
CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Technology requires the design of completely new high-pressure systems whereas so-called "drop-in solutions" (the adaptation of current systems to new substances) are potentially more cost-efficient. 

The Alliance for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Solutions claims, however that the initial costs of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; systems will be around €5 higher than drop-in solutions and that over a car’s life cycle, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; air conditioning systems will be more cost-efficient than any currently used or proposed new chemical blends. (see [[#Arguments_for_CO2|Arguments for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]).
{{CO2}} has been classified as Safety Class A1 (low-toxic, non-flammable refrigerant) by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliance-co2-solutions.org/docs/ASHRAE_standard.pdf ASHRAE Standard 34]&lt;/ref&gt; – the highest safety class possible.  As the charge of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the air conditioning systems is very small (200-400 g) there is no realistic danger for the passengers, even in case of accidental release.

===Arguments for non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; refrigerants===

*Refrigerants such as the greenpeace-developed '[[isobutane#Uses|Greenfreeze]]', based on purified [[butane]]/[[propane]] mixtures, are entirely 'natural', and due to increased efficiency over refrigerants such as [[R134a]], allow the use of very small amounts of refrigerant to be used.
*Use of pure hydrocarbon refrigerants, which are 'backward compatible' with even early [[Freon]] (R-12) car air conditioning systems, would allow these systems to be easily converted (without modification), increasing their efficiency, and preventing further release of harmful R-134a and R-12 to the atmosphere.

===Arguments against non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; refrigerants===
Butane and propane are very flammable petroleum products; they are used as fuels for gas [[barbecue]] grills, disposable lighters, etc. Like gasoline, to which it chemically is closely related, propane has a tendency to explode if mixed with oxygen and ignited in an enclosed container.&lt;!-- The next remark is so dubious that I am removing it unless or until a source for the claim is found: However the small quantities should make this risk minimal.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}--&gt;

The use of highly flammable hydrocarbon gases such as butane and propane as automotive refrigerants raises serious safety concerns.  The EPA, in evaluating motor vehicle air conditioning substitutes for CFC-12 (Freon, or R-12) under its SNAP program, has classified as "Unacceptable Substitutes" other "Flammable blend[s] of hydrocarbons" by reason of "insufficient data to demonstrate safety."  The EPA defines "Unacceptable" in this context as "illegal for use as a CFC-12 substitute in motor vehicle air conditioners".  All of the refrigerants which EPA approved for motor vehicle use in place of CFC-12 (as of 28 September 2006) contain no more than 4% total flammable hydrocarbons (butane, isobutane, and/or isopentane).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/ozone/snap/refrigerants/macssubs.html#otherinfo EPA: Choosing and Using Alternative Refrigerants for Motor Vehicle Air Conditioning&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, it appears unlikely, for safety reasons, that EPA will approve 'Greenfreeze' or similar hydrocarbon-based refrigerants for automotive use.

==Latest and next steps==
In September 2007, the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) officially announced its decision to use CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the refrigerant in next-generation air conditioning. Other carmakers from Europe and the rest of the world may follow the German lead.

A working group at ACEA, the European carmakers’ association, was to be drafting a common position on the issue to be adopted across the whole industry by end-2007.

However, on 9 April 2009, German public television channel ARD aired a report claiming that VDA members would be using loopholes in the law to avoid complying with the EU directive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r744.com/articles/2009-04-10-german-tv-explains-car-industry-boycott-of-eu-law.php German TV explains car industry boycott of EU law]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The DO-IT (Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking, and Technology) Center''' is based at the [[University of Washington|University of Washington (UW)]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Founded in 1992, DO-IT’s mission is to increase the successful participation of [[people with disabilities]] in [[postsecondary education]] and careers, in [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math|STEM]] ([[science]], [[technology]], [[engineering]], [[mathematics]]) fields and careers, and in [[computing]] fields and careers throughout the U.S.  It directs the national AccessSTEM program, and co-directs the national AccessComputing Alliance focused on engaging people with disabilities in computing fields.

The Center is a unit of Accessible Technology Services of UW-IT at the University of Washington, a collaboration between the College of Engineering, the College of Education and UW-IT.  Primary funding for DO-IT and its projects is provided by the [[National Science Foundation]], the State of Washington, and the [[U.S. Department of Education]].
It promotes [[accessibility]] and [[universal design]] in [[learning]] environments and instruction, including [[Web accessibility]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mendels|first=Pamela|title=Barriers Online for Those With Disabilities|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/11/cyber/articles/04disability.html|accessdate=4 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 4, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the online Center for Universal Design in Education (CUDE) and by creating, collecting and distributing publications, training materials, and tutorials for use by educators and faculty throughout the U.S.

The Center works with international institutions and organizations to adapt its practices and programs for international application.  For example, the [[DO-IT Scholars Program]] has been replicated in [[Japan]] as DO-IT Japan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://doit-japan.org/ DO-IT Japan] Retrieved 2013-03-04.&lt;/ref&gt; a summer program hosted by the [[University of Tokyo]]. [[South Korea]], through the leadership of [[Seoul National University]] and [[Korea Nazarene University]], also hosts a similar summer study program in collaboration with the DO-IT Center.

==History==

The DO-IT Center was founded at the University of Washington in 1992 by Dr. Sheryl Burgstahler with a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF). Since its inception, DO-IT's mission has been to increase the successful participation of people with disabilities in postsecondary education and careers at local, regional, national (within the United States) and international levels.&lt;ref&gt;Burgstahler, S, [http://www.washington.edu/doit/Brochures/Programs/ar93.html "DO-IT Center Annual Report 1992 - 1993"], DO-IT Center, 1993. Retrieved 2013-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, with funding from NSF, DO-IT launched the first [[DO-IT Scholars Program]]. In 1999, the U.S. Department of Education Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE) funded the DO-IT Prof project, which created professional development materials and trained faculty and academic administrators in the U.S. to more fully include students with disabilities in their courses.&lt;ref name="doit funding overivew"&gt;[http://www.washington.edu/doit/Brochures/Academics/access_college.html "AccessCollege: Systemic Change for Postsecondary Institutions"], DO-IT Center. Retrieved 2013-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, OPE and the NSF funded DO-IT’s AccessCollege project.&lt;ref name="doit funding overivew"/&gt; AccessCollege staff worked with a team of faculty and administrators representing twenty-three two- and four-year institutions in the U.S.; the project included creation of the web-based Center for Universal Design in Education (CUDE), publication of the book ''Universal Design in Higher Education: From Principles to Practice'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Burgstahler | first = Sheryl |author2=Burgstahler, S. |author3=Cory, R. | year = 2008 | title = Universal Design in Higher Education: From Principles to Practice  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TUEmAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Universal+design+in+higher+education:+From+principles+to+practice&amp;dq=Universal+design+in+higher+education:+From+principles+to+practice | publisher  = Harvard Education Press | isbn = 9781891792915}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the training manual ''Building Capacity for a Welcoming and Accessible Postsecondary Institution''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washington.edu/doit/cbiN/index_pdf.html "Building Capacity for a Welcoming and Accessible Postsecondary Institution"], DO-IT Center. Retrieved 2013-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
In 2006, with funding from the NSF, the DO-IT Center partnered with [[University of Washington|University of Washington's]] Department of Computer Science and Engineering to launch the AccessComputing Alliance, a nationwide program to increase the participation of people with disabilities in computing fields. In 2006, AccessComputing partners included [[Gallaudet University]] in Washington, D.C., [[Microsoft]], the NSF Regional Alliances for Persons with Disabilities in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (hosted by the [[University of Southern Maine]], [[New Mexico State University]] and University of Washington), and American Computing Machinery’s Special Interest Group on Accessible Computing. As of 2013, 32 postsecondary institutions and organizations are partnered with AccessComputing.&lt;ref name="accesscomputing"/&gt;
The program provides summer research programs and internships open to all U.S. students.&lt;ref name="accesscomputing"&gt;[http://www.washington.edu/accesscomputing/ AccessComputing], DO-IT Center. Retrieved 2013-02-10)&lt;/ref&gt;

The DO-IT Center's programs are centered on the concept of identifying the "critical junctures" students with disabilities face on their path to postsecondary education and careers, and providing resources, projects and programs to help students successfully navigate these critical junctures (e.g., projects to develop STEM interests in students with disabilities at the "critical juncture" between high school and the transition to a four- or two-year postsecondary institution).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Rachel|title=UW offers deaf, hard of hearing chance to excel at computer academy|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/UW-offers-deaf-hard-of-hearing-chance-to-excel-1243067.php|accessdate=8 March 2013|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=July 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;   DO-IT programs for students include AccessComputing, AccessSTEM, the [[DO-IT Scholars Program]] (for Washington State students), postsecondary preparation activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lindblom|first=Mike|title=They've A Mind To Excel -- UW's Do-It Program Prepares Disabled Students For College Science Studies|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19980814&amp;slug=2766540|accessdate=4 March 2013|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=August 14, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and work-based experiences and internships.

=== Programs for Students with Disabilities ===

The Center serves students with a wide range of disabilities, including (but not limited to):

* visual disabilities - [[blindness]], [[low vision]], and [[color blindness]]
* [[physical disabilities]] 
* [[cognitive disabilities]]
* [[learning disabilities]]
* [[deafness]] and [[hearing impairment]]s
* [[traumatic brain injury]]

* gain requisite knowledge to enter and succeed in postsecondary education.

The DO-IT Center website provides online resources for students with disabilities and their parents, educators, employers, and technology specialists. These resources include the DO-IT Knowledge Base, a searchable, comprehensive online database of articles, case studies and promising practices related to accessibility of technology, postsecondary education, graduate school, and careers. Other DO-IT resources include information about [[assistive technology]], [[Student financial aid in the United States|financial aid]], and resources for [[veterans]].

===Center for Universal Design in Education (CUDE)===

The online Center for Universal Design in Education (CUDE), directed by DO-IT and established in 2005, develops and collects web-based resources to help U.S. and international educators apply [[universal design]] to all aspects of education, including applying principles of [[Universal design for instruction|Universal Design for Instruction]] and [[Universal Design for Learning]] to instruction, and applying universal design to student services, information technology, and physical spaces.

CUDE is funded by grants from the U.S. Department of Education and the National Science Foundation.

===DO-IT Resources for Educators &amp; Faculty===

The DO-IT Center provides extensive information, resources, training materials, and tutorials to educators, faculty, and others interested in accessibility and increasing the participation of students with disabilities in postsecondary education.  Articles, training materials, and tutorials address a wide range of accessibility issues, including:

* [[Universal design]]
* [[Universal design for instruction|Universal design of instruction]]
* [[Accessibility]] 
* [[Assistive Technology]]
* [[Web accessibility|Accessible Web design]]
* Accessibility in [[Distance Learning]]
* Accessibility in STEM curricula, classes, labs, and careers
* Accommodation strategies 
* Multi-modal methods for presenting classroom material
* Variety of [[learning styles]] (e.g. auditory, visual, kinesthetic, experiential, or a combination of styles)
* Evidence-based practices for increasing the participation of students with disabilities.

'''Thomistic sacramental theology''' is [[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]]'s theology of the [[sacraments of the Catholic Church]]. It can be found through his writings in the ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'' and in the ''[[Summa Theologiæ]]''.  As can be seen, Aquinas relied heavily on Scriptural passages, as well as the writings of various Church Fathers.  [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] says (De Civ. Dei x): "The visible sacrifice is the sacrament.  This is the sacred sign of the invisible sacrifice.  A thing is called a sacrament, either by having a certain hidden sanctity, and in this sense a sacrament is a sacred secret;  or from having some relationship to this sanctity.  A sacrament is a sign.  Moreover, it is a sacred sign.  Divine Wisdom provides for each thing according to its mode.  [[Wisdom]] 7,1 :  "she... ordered all things sweetly";  and from [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 25,15:  "[she] gave to everyone according to his proper ability."  It is a part of human nature to acquire knowledge of the intelligible from the sensible.  A sign is the way one obtains knowledge of something else.  The sacraments are the signs by which humans gain knowledge of spiritual and intelligible goods.  [[Ephesians]] 5, 25-26:  "Christ loved the Church, and delivered Himself up for it;  that He might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life."  [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] says (Tract. xxx in John): "The word is added to the element, and this becomes the sacrament."  Augustine (Contra Faust xix):  "It is impossible to keep men together in one religious denomination, whether true or false, except they be united by means of visible signs or sacraments."  It is necessary for salvation that humans united together in the name of true religion.  Therefore, sacraments are necessary for man's salvation.  There are three reasons sacraments are necessary to the salvation of humans:  First, it is in the nature of humans to be led by things corporal and sensible to things that are spiritual and intelligible.  Second, by sinning, humans have subjected themselves to corporeal things.  Therefore, it is proper that the remedy have a corporeal side, leading to the spiritual.  Third, humans are prone to direct their activity towards material things (things that can be seen and felt).  Sacraments are made necessary because humans have sinned.  The main effect of the sacraments is grace, in particular those involving Virtues and Gifts.  Grace perfects the soul and allow participation in the Divine Nature.  Furthermore, the effects of the sacraments is justification.  This is an interior effect.  [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 8,33:  "God justifies."  Therefore, the effects of the sacraments is justification.  This is an interior effect.  The power of the sacraments is from God, alone.  It does not matter that the minister of the sacraments may be a sinner, or evil.  Augustine (commenting on [[Gospel of John|John]] 1,33):  "He upon Whom you shall see the Spirit, ...that John did not know that our Lord, having the authority of baptizing, would keep it to Himself, but that the ministry would certainly pass to both good and evil men...What is a bad minister to you, wherever the Lord is good?"

==Sacraments==
{{see also|Sacraments (Catholic Church)}}
There are seven sacraments:  [[Baptism]], [[Confirmation]], [[Holy Eucharist]], [[Penance]], [[Extreme Unction]] (Anointing of the Sick), [[Holy Orders]], [[Matrimony]].  From [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Dionysius]] (Eccl. Hier. iii): "No one receives hierarchical perfection save by the most God-like Eucharist."   Therefore, the Holy Eucharist is the greatest of the sacraments.  This is because it is the real presence of the Body and Blood of Christ.  It perfects the other sacraments.  From [[Summa Contra Gentiles]] Book 4, Chapter 58:  The spiritual remedies of salvation have been given to men under sensible signs.  In bodily life we find a twofold order:  1.)  For some propagate and order the bodily life in others. 2.)  Some are propagated and ordered in the bodily life.  In a  bodily life three things are necessary of themselves, and a fourth is incidental.  1.) Generation by birth.  2.)  Growth to arrive at due size and strength.  3.)  Nourishment is necessary.  These three are assigned to the vegetative soul.  4.)  Healing of the sick living thing.  These are mirrored in the spiritual life of the sacraments.  1.) Baptism:  spiritual generation.  2.)  Confirmation:  spiritual growth.  3.)  Eucharist:  spiritual nourishment.  4.)  Penance and Extreme Unction (Anointing of the Sick):  spiritual healing.

==Baptism==
{{see also|Baptism}}
The sacrament of [[Baptism]] has the outward sign of a washing.  "He that washes himself (baptuzatur) after touching the dead, if he touched them again, what does his washing avail?"  ([[Sirach]] 34,30).  The sacrament does not come from the water, but from the act of pouring the water, in the form of a washing.  ([[St. Hugh of Victor]] held that the water was the sacrament, but this is in error.)  The outward reality is in the washing with water, while the sacramental sign is the inward justification: this is the reality, or inward reality of the sacrament.  The inward reality is a seal and a safeguarding.  [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Dionysius]] defined Baptism by its relation to the other sacraments (Eccl. Hier.ii) that it is the principle that forms the habits of the soul for the reception of those most holy words and sacraments;  by its relation to heavenly glory, which is the universal end of all sacraments, preparing the way for us, whereby we mount to the repose of the heavenly kingdom, conferring on us our most sacred and Godlike regeneration.  The power of Baptism was initiated when Christ was Baptized, and not during the passion.  The proper way to Baptize is "I Baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit."  This comes from Matthew 28,19: "Going .... teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."  [[Ephesians]] 5,26: "Cleansing the world by the cleaning laver of the water."  [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] says (De Unico Baptismo iv) that Baptism is consecrated by the words of the Gospel.  Full immersion in water is not necessary.  It is symbolic of the inward cleansing of the sin.  [[Hebrews]] 10.22:  "Let us draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with clean water."  [[Ezekiel]]  36:25:  "25Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you."  Baptism cannot be reiterated.  [[Ephesians]] 4, 5:  "One Faith, one Baptism."  Baptism is a spiritual rebirth.  [[Gospel of John|John]] 3,5: "Unless a man is born again of water and the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven."  [[Gospel of John|John]]  3,4:  "A man cannot re-enter the womb."  Therefore, he cannot be re-Baptized.  (cf. [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 4, 3-4)  Because we are baptized in Christ's death, by which we die to sin and rise again into a newness of life.  Now, Christ died once.  Baptism imprints a character which is indelible.  Baptism is the principle remedy against [[original sin]].  Romans 5,18:  "...as by the offense of one, unto all men to condemnation, so also by the justice of one, all men are justified of life."  There are three kinds of Baptism: Baptism of water, of Blood (Martyrdom) and of the Spirit (Baptism of Desire).  Hebrews 4,2: "[Of baptism) He uses the plural, because there is Baptism of Water, of Repentance and of Blood."  [[Isaiah]] 4, 4:  "The Lord shall wash away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall wash away the blood of Jerusalem, out of the midst thereof, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning."  [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (De Unico Baptismo Parvulrum, iv): "The Blessed Cyprian argues with considerable reason from the thief to whom, though not baptized, it was said, 'Today you shall be with Me in Paradise', that suffering can take the place of Baptism.  Having weighed this again and again, I perceive that not only can suffering for the name of Christ supply what is lacking in Baptism, but even faith and conversion of heart, if perchance on account of stress of the times the celebration of the mystery of Baptism is not practicable."  Priests are the proper ministers to perform Baptism.  [[Isidore of Seville|Isidore]] (of Spain) says priests are the only ministers who can perform Baptism.  However,  even Isidore and [[Pope Gelasius I]] say that it is often permissible for Christian laymen to baptize in cases of urgency.  Women can baptize.  This was approved by [[Pope Urban II]] and from [[Colossians]] 3: "In Christ there is neither male nor female.:  Isidore indicates that even a person who is not baptized may baptize, since it is the Holy Spirit Who performs the mystery of the Baptism.  Augustine never answered this question.  But the Church has long since determined that Jews and non-baptized heretics can baptize.  It is possible to be saved even without Baptism of Water, if the person has the proper desire, and has no contempt for the Sacrament.  Baptism should not be delayed.  [[Sirach]] 5, 8: "Delay not to be converted to the Lord and defer it not from day to day."  Children of heretics and Jews should not be baptized against the will of their parents. (See [[Thought of Thomas Aquinas]] for a detailed discussion.)  It is beneficial to baptize imbeciles and madmen.  Baptism opens the gates of heaven to sinners.  [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 3,21: "Heaven was opened."  The gloss of [[Bede]] "We see here the power of Baptism;  from which when a man comes forth, the gates of the heavenly kingdom are opened to him."  Baptism has an equal effect on all.  Ephesians 4, 5:  "One Faith, One Baptism."  After one has reached the age of reason, it is necessary to receive the Baptism with sincerity.  If the Sacrament is received in bad faith, then one has a change of heart, the effects of Baptism are salutory (Augustine).  From Summa Contra Gentiles, Book 4, Chapter 59:  Bede: "Baptism opens the gates of heaven." A spiritual generation is needed only once, hence baptism is given only once.  The sin of Adam makes a man guilty only once.  Baptism is chiefly directed at this infection.  This excludes the errors of the [[Donatists]] or the [[Rebaptizers]] (Augustine).

==Confirmation==
{{see also|Confirmation (Catholic Church)}}
===''Summa Contra Gentiles''===
The following is condensed from [[Summa Contra Gentiles]], Book 4, Chapter 60:  

The perfection of spiritual strength consists in a man's daring to confess the faith of Christ in the presence of everyone.  This is done without error or confusion.  Spiritual strength drives out inordinate terror.  This is the sacrament of Confirmation.   One becomes a front line fighter for the faith of Christ.  Warriors carry the insignia of their master.  So it is with the confirmed: they carry the sign of Christ.  The signing takes place with a mixture of oil and balm which is called chrism, and not without reason.    This designated the power of the Holy Spirit.  They are called anointed ([[Psalm]] 44,8; [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 4,18).  They are called Christians [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 9,26).  This is because they are warriors under Christ.  The balm gives a pleasing fragrance, which indicates one of good public repute.  These are called forth from the recesses of the Church to the field of battle.  This sacrament is conferred only by bishops.  These are enrolled in the spiritual military forces.  Manliness is derived from Christ.

(Comment:  This is a particularly militant statement by Aquinas, something that is not uncommon in Summa Contra Gentiles.  The statement in [[Summa Theologica]] is more refined.  See infra. AEF)

===''Summa Theologiæ''===
Condensed from [[Summa Theologiæ]]: 

Concerning the institution of this sacrament there are three opinions.  [[Alexander of Hales]] (Summa Theol. PIV, Q  IX) and [[St. Bonaventure]] (IV, Sent. vii) have maintained that this sacrament was instituted neither by Christ, nor by the apostles;  but later in the course of time by one of the councils.  [[Pierre de Tarantaise]] (IV Sent. vii) held that it was instituted by the apostles.  But this cannot be admitted.  A Sacrament belongs to the power of excellence, which belongs to Christ alone.  Therefore, we must say that Christ instituted this sacrament not by bestowing, but by promising it according to [[Gospel of John|John]] 16, 7:  "If I don't leave, the Paraclete will not come to you, but if I go, I will send Him to you."  Confirmation is the sacrament of the fullness of grace.  [[Gospel of John|John]] 7,39:  "As yet the Spirit was not given, because Jesus was not yet glorified."  Chrism is a fitting natter for the Sacrament.  [[Sirach]] 24, 21:  "My odor is as the purest balm."  The proper form of the Sacrament is:  "I sign you with the sign of the cross, etc."  This is within the authority of the Church to prescribe.  It is proper to call the chrism either the oil of salvation or the oil of sanctification.  Confirmation confirms a character.  It is in the form of a consecration and cannot be repeated, once it is administered.  The character of Confirmation is the gift of the Paraclete, as promised by scripture.  It is given to the baptized to publish the faith, as strengthened by the Holy Spirit.  This is similar to what occurred with the Apostles on Pentecost, and reiterates the sanctifying grace with the Apostles received from the Paraclete.  Those who say the Sacrament should not be given are in error, because the "works of God are perfect" ([[Deuteronomy]] 32, 4).  The sanctifying grace of Confirmation tends to make strong and perfect the faith of the person.  [[Hugh of St. Victor]] (De Sacram. ii) "It would be altogether hazardous, if anyone happened to go forth from this life without being Confirmed."

==The Holy Eucharist==
{{see also|Eucharist (Catholic Church)}}

===''Summa Contra Gentiles''===
Condensed from [[Summa Contra Gentiles]], Book 4, Chapters 61 to 69: 

Life needs material nourishment to increase in quantity and to maintain the body. Spiritual effects are given under the likeness of things that are visible, hence are given the appearance of things men commonly use for bodily nourishment.  These are bread and wine.  He who begets is joined to the begotten in a way.  The nourished and the nourishment are joined.  It is the spiritual mystery that unites the Eucharist to us.  [[Gospel of John|John]] 6, 56: "My flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed."  John 6, 61:  "This saying is hard, and who can bear it?"  So it is with the heretics who put themselves at odds with the teaching of the Church.  [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 26, 26 "This is my body."  It should be noted that He did not say, "This is a sign or representation of my body."  Yet some heretics disclaim the truth of the presence of Christ in the Eucharist.  To some, it appears scandalous to eat the flesh and drink the blood of Christ.  [[Gospel of John|John]] 6, 64:  "The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life."  A thing begins to be where it was not before in two ways:  1.) by local motion; 2.) Conversion of something into itself.  Manifestly, the body of Christ ascended into  heaven, hence cannot be always on the altar.  It does not seem possible to some there is a new conversion of another into itself on the altar.  In a similar manner, a thing cannot be moved from one place to another without ceasing to be in the original place.  Therefore, it seems to some that Christ must cease to be in heaven when He is on the altar.  It seems impossible to some that the large body of a man could be contained in the host used in the Eucharist.  It is also hard to understand how the body of Christ can be present simultaneously, on many altars at once.  Another stumbling block is the appearance of the bread and wine.  The accidents of color, taste, figure, etc. remain.  [[Aristotle]] "The being of an accident is by inheritance."  Another problem occurs from the fact that the action and passion of the bread and wine are unchanged after the consecration.  Another problem occurs in the breaking of the bread, for it seems to some that the fragment of the bread cannot contain the whole body.  This would be as if a man lost an arm or leg, his whole being would be contained in the portion.  It is true that the teachings of the Church about the Eucharist are difficult.  Divine power operates in this sacrament with great secrecy and sublimity. It is beyond the ability of man to search it out.  The conversion occurs by a divine mode, and is not natural (in the way we understand it) in any way.  Air can be converted to fire.  This is called a formal conversion. But in the conversion of the Eucharist, a subject passes over into a subject without a change in the accidents.  This is called "substantial".  It was wise of Christ to assume the form of bread and wine, since it would be horrible for the believers to consume a real human body and blood.  Furthermore, it would be an abomination for those watching to observe such a thing.  There is a real conversion which takes place: "This is My Body...This is My Blood."  His body is contained in the bread by the force of conversion, while the blood is a natural accompaniment.  Under the appearance of wine, the converse is true.  The body of Christ is not related to place, with its own dimensions as a medium.  In the body of Christ, His own dimensions exist in one place only, but through the mediation of the dimensions of the bread passing into its places are as many as there are places in which this sort of conversion is celebrated.  It is not divided into parts, but is entire in every single one.  Every consecrated bread is converted into the entire Body of Christ.  The Body and Blood of Christ is not affected by the accidents of the bread and wine.  It is not impossible that divine power can affect the subject without changing the nature of the accidents.  In this sacrament He conserves the accident while changing the substance.  According to [[Aristotle]], the [[Platonists]] held that this was not possible.  But it is clear that God can do more in operation that the intellect of man can comprehend.  The Body and Blood are contained under the appearance.  [[Aristotle]]:  "Position is the order of parts of the whole... quantity is that which has position... with the quantity gone, all substance is indivisible."  Since we hold that in this sacrament the measurements subsist of themselves and that the other accidents are founded on these as on a subject, we need not say that accidents of this kind are not individuated;  for there persists in the measurements themselves the root of individuation.  In this sacrament, the accidents of the bread and wine persists.  Concerning passions (such as those which take place in the alterations of accidents of this kind), the difficulty is not hard to understand if the premises are granted.  The difficulty occurs regarding the generation and corruption which seems to take place in this sacrament.  If enough quantity of this sacrament were to be consumed, one could be nourished, and even made drunk.  [[I Corinthians]] 11, 21:  "One indeed is hungry and another is drunk."  It is amazing that some would claim that the bread and wine could not be converted into the body and blood of Christ, when we know that by putrefaction and combustion, this same bread is converted to dust and ashes.  However, the substance of a thing should not be confused with the accidents.  Combustion and putrefaction are not miracles, but the normal order of nature.  The conversion of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ is miraculous. The final difficulty is that whereby every portion of the bread contains the whole Christ. We should not seek the solutions in terms of mediating dimensions.  For every drop of water contains the nature and species of water.  The whole soul is in every part of the body.  Therefore, the breaking of the bread does not affect the dimensions of the whole body of Christ.  Ultimately, the Eucharist should be viewed from this standpoint:  nothing is impossible for God Who can do all things.  [[Gospel of John|John]] 6, 64:  "The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life."  We are to take this that there are certain spiritual foods given to us that are quite apart from earthly carnal foods.  One properly calls wine the liquid expressed from grapes.  We call bread that which is made from grain wheat.  If an admixture is introduced, the nature of the bread or wine can be lost.  It is not essential whether the bread be leavened or unleavened. [[St. Gregory]] "the Roman Church offers unleavened bread because our Lord took on flesh without any admixture.  But the rest of the Churches offer leavened bread, since the Word of God  was clothed with flesh, and is true God and true man, just as the leavened bread is mixed with paste."  Still, it is in greater harmony with the truth to use unleavened bread.  [[I Corinthians]] 5, 7-8:  "Christ our pasch is sacrificed.  Therefore, let us feast... with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."  There are certain Greek heretics who say that the sacrament cannot be offered with unleavened bread.  However, in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 26,17;  [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 14,12;  [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22,7, it is indicated that Christ performed the first Eucharist with unleavened bread.   Furthermore, it is clear that the use of unleavened bread is required by the Old Law ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 12,15).  The Greek arguments against the Latin Church for using unleavened bread are not based on scriptural interpretation.  Some use [[I Corinthians]] 11,23 and John 18,28 to indicate that leavened bread was used in the first pasch.  However, the Old Law was observed, and it is clear that unleavened bread would have been used at the Last Supper.  All the [[Gospels]]  ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]) indicate that the pasch was celebrated in accordance with the Old law.  It is clear that the Latin Church is reasonable in the use of unleavened bread.

===''Summa Theologiæ''===
The following is condensed from ''[[Summa Theologiæ]]'':

The Church's sacraments are ordained for helping man in the spiritual life.  But the spiritual life is analogous to the corporeal, since corporeal things bear a resemblance to spiritual.  There is only one sacrament in the Eucharist.  [[I Corinthians]] 10,17 "For we, being many, are one bread one body, all that partake of one bread."  It is clear that the Eucharist is the sacrament of the Church's unity.  This is to say that, just as Baptism is necessary for salvation, and can be obtained by desire, so can the Eucharist be obtained by desire.  Baptism is the beginning of spiritual life.  Baptism ordains a man for the reception of the Eucharist, which nourishes the spiritual life. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] explaining [[Gospel of John|John]] 6, 54:  "This food and this drink, namely, of His flesh and blood:  He would have us understand the fellowship of His body and members, which is the Church in His predestinated, and called, and justified, and glorified, His body and believing ones.  No one should entertain the slightest doubt, that then every one of this faithful becomes a partaker of the body and blood of Christ, when in Baptism he is made a member of Christ's body, nor is he deprived of his share in that body and chalice even though he depart from this world in the unity of Christ's body before he eats that bread and drinks that chalice."  [[John of Damascus|Damascene]] says that it is called [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|Communion]] because we communicate with Christ through it, both because we partake of His flesh and Godhead, and because we communicate with and are united to one another through it.  It is called the [[Eucharist]] because it is the "good grace" because it leads to the grace of God everlasting ([[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 4,23);  or because it really contains Christ, Who is full of grace.  The sacrament was instituted by Christ, of Whom it is said ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 7,37) that He did all things well.  [[Eusebius]] says "Since He was going to withdraw His assumed body from their eyes, and bear it away to the stars, it was needful that on the day of the supper He should consecrate the sacrament of His body and blood for our sakes, in order that what was once offered up for our ransom should be fittingly worshiped in a mystery."  Without faith in the Passion there could never be any salvation.  [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 3, 25:  "Whom God has proposed to be propitiation, through faith in His blood."  The chief sacrament of the Old Law was the Paschal Lamb.   [[I Corinthians]] 5, 7: "Christ our Pasch is sacrificed."  [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] ({{Not a typo|Respons}}. ad januar, i) "In order to commend more earnestly the depth of this mystery, our Savior willed this last act to be fixed in the hearts and memories of the disciples whom He was about to quit for the Passion."  And [[I Corinthians]] 5, 7-8:  "Christ our Pasch is sacrificed;  therefore let us feast.. with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."  Wheat is the appropriate matter for the bread of the host. [[Gospel of John|John]] 12,24:  "Unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it remains alone."  Therefore, Christ has compared Himself to the grain of wheat.  The presence of Christ's true body and blood in this sacrament cannot be detected by sense, nor understanding, but by faith alone, which rests upon the Divine authority.  [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22,19:  "This is My Body, which shall be delivered up for you."  [[Cyril]] says "Doubt not whether this is true;  but take rather the Savior's words with faith;  for since He is the Truth and He does not lie."

The consecration occurs when the priest states the words, "This is My Body;  this is My Blood."  But when the priest says this, it is Jesus Christ Who is saying it.  [[Ambrose]] (De Sacram. iv) "The consecration is accomplished by the words and expressions of the Lord Jesus.  Because, by all the other words spoken, praise is rendered to God, prayer is put up for the people, for kings and others;  but when the tome comes for perfecting the sacrament, the priest no longer uses his own words, but the words of Christ.  Therefore, it is Christ's words that perfect this sacrament."  Furthermore, for those who doubt the validity of these words, and who doubt that God could or would do this, [[Ambrose]] adds:  "If there be such might in the word of the Lord Jesus that things non-existent came into being, how much more efficacious is it to make things existing to continue, and to be changed into something new?  And so, what was the bread before the consecration is now the body of Christ after consecration, because Christ's word changes a creature into something different."  This is because Jesus Christ is the Word of God, which caused all creation to come into being.

==Penance, Confession (Reconciliation)==
{{see also|Confession (Catholic Church)}}
The following is condensed from [[Summa Contra Gentiles]], Book 4, Chapters 70-72:  

Although grace is bestowed upon men by the sacraments, they are not rendered incapable of sin.  He who receives the gratuitous gifts of grace, can still sin by acting against grace.  [[Aristotle]] "every evil man is ignorant."  [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 14,22: "They err that work evil."  [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 12,15:  "Looking diligently, lest any man be wanting to the grace of God;  lest any root of bitterness springing up to hinder."  [[Ephesians]] 4, 30:  "Grieve not the Holy  Spirit of God whereby you are sealed."   [[I Corinthians]] 9.27:  "I chastise my body and bring into subjection, lest perhaps when I preached to others, I myself should become a castaway."  This does away with the belief of some heretics that say that after a man has received the grace of the Spirit, is unable to sin, and that if he sins, he never had the grace of the Holy Spirit.  In this, they used to following to support their position: [[I Corinthians]] 13, *:  "Charity never falls away."  [[Gospel of John|John]]  3, 6-9: "Whoever abides in Him sins not, and whosoever sins has not seen Him nor known Him."  This is rebutted by the following:  [[Apocalypse]] 2, 4: "I have somewhat against you because you have your first charity."  [[I Corinthians]] 1, 8-10: "Shall be made void... when that which is perfect is come."  It is then that a perfect state of charity shall abide.  As long as a man lives with grace granted him, he will not sin.  If he turns from that grace, he will sin.  (Note:  This is an interesting doctrine of some fundamentalist churches that was taught in Aquinas' time, and it is taught today: "he that has been baptized in the Spirit cannot sin, and he who sins never had the Spirit."  Of course, the doctrine is considered false by the Catholic Church.  It completely ignores both our concupiscent nature (which is not abrogated with baptism) and free will, which is not necessarily changed, at least immediately, by the action of the sacrament.  AEF)   As long as we are alive, the will is mutable toward good or evil.  Good is more powerful than evil.  [[I Corinthians]] 6,9-11: "Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, shall possess the Kingdom of God.  And such of you were;  but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you were justified in the name of Jesus Christ and the Spirit of our God."  Grace and the sacrament increases nature's good.  If sin takes place after grace is received, we can still be led back to a state of justice.  Despair is an invitation to sinfulness.  [[Ephesians]] 4,19:  "Despairing have given themselves up to lasciviousness, unto the working of all uncleanness, unto covetousness."  Despair is a dangerous cesspool leading men to vices.  [[I John]] 2, 1-2:  "My little children, these things I write to you, that you may not sin.  But if any man sins, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the just.  And He is the propitiation for our sins."  [[II Corinthians]] 2, 6-7, 7-9: "[To the Corinthian fornicator] To him who is such a one, this rebuke is sufficient which is given by many: so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him... I am glad:  not because you were made sorrowful, but because you were made sorrowful unto penance."  [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 3,1: "You have prostituted yourself to many lovers;  nevertheless, return to Me, says the Lord."  [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 5, 21: "Convert us, O Lord, and we shall be converted;  renew our days, as from the beginning."  In this way one excludes the error of the [[Novatianism|Novatians]] who were wont to deny forgiveness to those who had sinned after Baptism.  They used the following to justify their error:  [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 6, 4-5: "It is impossible for those who were once illuminated, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit, have moreover tasted the good of God, and the powers of the world to come, and are fallen away: to be renewed again to penance."  However, these overlooked the passage which followed:  "Crucify again themselves the Son of God and of Him a mockery."  Therefore, to be renewed, one must be again crucified with the penance of Christ.  [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 6, 3:  "All we who were baptized in Christ Jesus are baptized in His death."  [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]] 3, 5: "According to His mercy, He has saved us, by the laver of regeneration and renovation of the Holy Spirit."  If a man sins after baptism, he cannot have baptism as a remedy.  Baptism, which is a spiritual regeneration cannot be given a second time.  When a person is healed by something given to him by a doctor, it is the healing power within him that heals him.  The spiritual health in the sacrament of penance is both internal and external.  Sins come from  disordering of the mind.  This is the first damage.  The second is that there is the guilt of punishment.  The third damage is the weakening of the general good, whereby a person is rendered more likely to sin again.  The first thing required is a proper ordering of the mind.  This cannot be achieved without the physician of the soul, Jesus Christ. [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 1, 21:  "[Jesus Christ] Who shall save his people from their sins."  [[I Peter]] 1, 3: "[Christ] regenerated us unto a lively hope."  It is turning the mind to God with a complete hatred of the sin that there is a remission of the sin and a wiping out of the fault.  However, there sometimes remains a fault.  The second part of the remission of sin in confession, is the actual confession itself.  This is the verbal communication of the sin to the minister of Christ.  [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 16, 19: "I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven."  Confession, like baptism, may be excluded by necessity, but no contempt in exigent circumstances [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].  [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 4, 10-12: "There is no other name given to men whereby we must be saved except by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ."  It is in this way that one avoids the error of [[Peter Lombard]] who said that confession was not necessary.  Satisfaction is the third part of penance.  It is evident that not every priest can absolve every man from every sin.  He can only do this when he has received the power to do so.  (Note: Peter Lombard was a prominent Scholastic in the Parisian scene in the late 12th century. AEF)

==Extreme Unction (Blessing of the Sick)==
{{main|Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)}}
The following is condensed from [[Summa Contra Gentiles]], Book 4, Chapter 73:  

The body is the instrument of the soul, and the instrument is for the use of the principal agent.  Hence, the body is disposed to be in harmony with the soul.  therefore, infirmity of the soul sometimes flows from the body, causing infirmity as well.  Also, bodily infirmity can sometimes hinder spiritual health.  Therefore, it was proper to employ a spiritual medicine against sin. [[Epistle of James|James]] 5, 14-15: "Is any man sick among you?  Let him bring in the priests of the Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.  And the prayer of the faith shall heal the sick man."  There is no guarantee that even is a man healed from his bodily infirmity, that he will necessarily be forgiven the infirmity of the soul.  Also, some who do not recover, physically, may enjoy great spiritual restoration from the sacrament. James adds: "And the Lord shall raise him up... if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven."  Now it frequently occurs that a man in a state of illness has no recollection of the sins he has committed, and never confessed, nor performed penance for remission.  It is impossible for one to lead a daily life without committing some form of sin.  This sacrament should serve to cleanse these sins.  This sacrament does not confer a consecration as occurs in Baptism or Confirmation.  Still, the sacrament should not be administered to one who is healthy, but rather reserved for the sick, since it has the external appearance of a medicine, or a medicinal rite.  The oils should be applied to the sources of the sins, namely the organs of the senses and the hands and the feet, by which the works of sin are carried out.  Some engage in anointing the loins, since these are a source of sin.  There is nothing incorrect in this practice.  Since no sin is forgiven, except by grace, it is clear that grace is conferred in this sacrament.  [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Dionysius]]: "It is proper for priests to confer this sacrament."  This is because the sacrament confers enlightening grace, and the order of priests tends to enlightenment. However, the sacrament does not require a bishop.  The effect of the sacrament can be blocked by a pretense in the receiver.  In this way, it is no different from any other sacrament.

==Holy Orders==
{{main|Holy orders (Catholic Church)}}
The following is condensed from [[Summa Contra Gentiles]], Book 4, Chapters 74-77.  According to [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Dionysius]], all the sacraments confer a spiritual grace.  This is a correct assessment.  The sacraments are conferred by visible men, who employ visual methods, to dispense invisible grace.  [[Hebrews]] 5, 1: "Every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in the things that appertain to God."  [[Ephesians]] 5, 25-26: "Christ loved the Church and delivered Himself up for it: that He might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life." [[I Corinthians]] 4, 1: "Let no man so account of us as ministers of Christ and  dispensers of the mysteries of God."  [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22, 19: "Do this in commemoration of Me."  [[Gospel of John|John]] 20, 23: "Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them."  The same instructions are given concerning teaching and baptizing.  [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 28, 19: "Going, therefore, teach all nations, baptizing them."  [[II Corinthians]] 13, 10: "The power which the Lord has given me unto edification and not into destruction."  [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] says this power is "for building up the Church."  [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 13, 27: "What I say to you, I say to all." [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 28, 20: "Behold, I am with you all days even to the consummation of the world."  The conferring of spiritual power is the province of the divine liberality.  This is the sacrament of Holy Orders.  The power of orders as a sacrament is established for the dispensation of the sacraments.  [[Aristotle]]:  "Everything is denominated from its end."  The power of orders must extend itself to the remission of sins by the dispensation of the sacraments which are ordered to the remission of sins:  baptism and penance (confession, reconciliation).  The powers of orders is also toward the Eucharist.  This is the meaning of the "keys to the Kingdom."  [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 15, 19: "I will give to you the keys to the Kingdom."  The lowest orders serves the priestly order.  These are doorkeepers who let the faithful in, and keep the unfaithful out.  Acolytes help prepare the sacred vessels.  Others prepare the people in the consummation of the sacrament. The three orders - the priesthood, the diaconate, and the subdiaconate are called sacred orders because they receive a ministry in something sacred.  There is a superior power within the Church which has a ministry of dispensing the sacrament of orders.  Church unity requires that all the faithful agree as to the faith.  In matters of faith, questions are bound to arise.  The unity of the Church demands that there is a single head of the Church.  This single head of the Church provides one voice to answer these questions.  [[Isaiah]] 5, 4: "What is there that I ought to do more to My vineyard that I have not done to it?"  It is a mistake to doubt that there is a single head of the Church.  [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 8, 15:  "Kings reign, and lawmakers decree just things." the best government is one ruled by one.  The Church is a militant Church.  [[Apocalypse]] 21, 2: "Jerusalem is coming down from heaven."  [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 25, 10; 26, 30:  "[Moses was told to make everything] according to the pattern I have shown you on the mountain." [[Apocalypse]] 21, 3: "They shall be His people and God Himself with them shall be their God."  In the militant Church, there must be one who presides over the things universally.  [[Book of Hosea|Osee]] 1, 11: "The children of [[Kingdom of Judah|Juda]] and the children of [[Israel]] shall be gathered together; and they shall appoint themselves a head."  [[Gospel of John|John]] 10, 16: "There shall be one fold and one shepherd." [[Gospel of John|John]] 21, 17:"Feed My sheep."  [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22, 32: "You being once converted confirm your brethren."  [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 16, 19: "I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven."  [[Isaiah]] 9, 7: "He shall sit upon the throne of [[David]] and upon His kingdom to establish and strengthen it with judgment and with justice from henceforth and forever."  [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 28, 20: "Behold I am with all days even to the consummation of the world."  By this is excluded all those who partake of the presumptuous error of saying that the [[Roman Pontiff]] is not the true successor of the rule of [[Saint Peter|Peter]].  It is in the nature of a consecration that it is persistent and lasts forever.  Nothing consecrated can be consecrated a second time.  A man is called good or bad in accord with the vice or virtue.  In this way, there is a habit of a sort.  Habit differs from power.  By power, we are able to do something.  By a habit we are not rendered able or unable to make something, but ready or unready in doing well or badly what we are able to do.  Habit neither gives ability nor removes it.  [[Gospel of John|John]] 1, 33: "He it is that baptizes."  The minister is an animate tool.  [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 7, 5: "Cursed be the man that trusts in man."   [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 23, 2-3: "The [[Scribes]] and [[Pharisees]] have sat on the chair of [[Moses]].  All things, therefore, whatsoever they do you, observe and do.  But according to their works, do you not."  This dispenses of the error of those who say that only good men can dispense sacraments, while evil ones cannot.

==Holy Matrimony==
{{see also|Marriage (Catholic Church)}}
The following is condensed from [[Summa Contra Gentiles]], Book 4, Chapter 78. So far as generation is ordered to a political good, it is subject to the ordering of [[law|civil law]]. Insofar as it is ordered to the good of the Church, it must be subject to the government of the Church. Matrimony consists of the union of a man and a woman purposing to generate and educate offspring for the worship of God.  It is a sacrament of the Church. 

Hence there is a certain blessing on those marrying that is given by the ministers of the Church. [[Ephesians]] 5, 32: "This is a great sacrament; but I speak in Christ and the Church." The union of a man and a woman mirrors the union of Christ and the Church. [[Canticles]] 6, 8: "one is My dove, My perfect one." [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 28, 20: "Behold I am with you all days even to the consummation of the world." [[I Thessalonians]] 4, 16: "We shall always be with the Lord." There are three goods [ends or aims] of matrimony as a sacrament of the Church:
#Offspring accepted and educated for the worship of God
#Fidelity by which one man is bound to one woman
#The sacrament by which there is an indivisibility of the union insofar as the sacrament is the union of Christ and the Church.

[[File:AskFS (5884080387).jpg|300px|right|thumb|UK Foreign Secretary [[William Hague]] answers questions on Afghanistan and Pakistan for his seventh Twitter Q&amp;A, 29 June 2011]]
'''Twitter diplomacy''', also "'''Twiplomacy'''" or "'''hashtag diplomacy'''", is the use of social network and microblogging website, [[Twitter]], by [[Head of state|heads of state]], leaders of [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental organizations (IGOs)]], and their [[diplomat]]s to conduct [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] outreach and [[public diplomacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Keleman|first=Michele|title=Twitter Diplomacy: State Department 2.0|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2012/02/21/147207004/twitter-diplomacy-state-department-2-0|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=National Public Radio|date=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twitter has taken on diverse and occasional roles in diplomatic communications, from cordial announcements of bi-lateral cooperation to terse exchanges and diplomatic jabs, as well as more casual posts.&lt;ref name="nyt-scripted"&gt;{{Cite news

== Origins ==
The term '''twitplomacy''' was proposed in 2011, in a pioneer{{Peacock term|date=February 2017}} work focused on the study of diplomacy within the social networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Treeintelligence|title=Twitplomacy|url=http://www.slideshare.net/treebranding/twitter-diplomacy-tree-branding|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better|date=February 2017}} This report purports to show how presidents use Twitter to keep diplomatic relationships with other presidents and political actors. However, the use of Twitter by world leaders and diplomats was on the rise as of April 2014{{cn|date=February 2017}}, but Twitter diplomacy was only one aspect of the growing trend{{cn|date=February 2017}} toward [[digital diplomacy]], also known as eDiplomacy or [[Facebook diplomacy]], by many world governments.{{or|date=February 2017}}

=== Twitter and diplomacy ===

As of April 2014, an estimated 241 million active users had joined Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Twitter|title=About Twitter, Inc.|url=https://about.twitter.com/company|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter also offers policymakers the possibility to hear the many perspectives of a worldwide audience.{{promotion-inline|date=February 2017}}

World leaders and their diplomats have taken note of Twitter's rapid expansion and have begun using it to engage with foreign publics and their own citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.oup.com/2017/10/twitter-diplomacy-practices-foreign-policy/|title=How Twitter enhances conventional practices of diplomacy {{!}} OUPblog|date=2017-10-05|work=OUPblog|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; US Ambassador to Russia, [[Michael A. McFaul]] has been attributed {{by whom|date=February 2017}} as a pioneer of international Twitter diplomacy. He used Twitter after becoming ambassador in 2011, posting in English and Russian.&lt;ref name="nyt-scripted" /&gt; A 2013 study by website Twiplomacy found that 153 of the 193 countries represented at the [[United Nations]] had established government Twitter accounts.&lt;ref name=twiplomacy&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Twiplomacy.com|title=Twiplomacy Study 2013 – International Organisations|url=http://twiplomacy.com/blog/twiplomacy-study-2013/|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same study also found that those accounts amounted to 505 Twitter handles used by world leaders and their foreign ministers, with their tweets able to reach a combined audience of over 106 million followers.&lt;ref name=twiplomacy /&gt;

Commenting in a 2013 publication on the subject for the Geneva-based, non-profit Diplo, former Italian Foreign Minister [[Giulio Terzi di Sant'Agata|Giulio Terzi]] said of social media, "Social media exposes foreign policymakers to global audiences while at the same time allowing governments to reach them instantly... Twitter has two big positive effects on foreign policy: it fosters a beneficial exchange of ideas between policymakers and civil society and enhances diplomats' ability to gather information and to anticipate, analyze, manage, and react to events."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DiploFoundation|title=Twitter for Diplomats|url=http://issuu.com/diplo/docs/twitter_for_diplomats|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy ===

Confrontations via Twitter diplomacy are visible to a worldwide audience because of Twitter's global nature.{{synthesis-inline|date=February 2017}}

In April 2014, tensions between the US State Department and the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] over the [[2014 Crimean crisis]] devolved into dueling tweets{{tone-inline|date=February 2017}}, with both ministries using the hashtag #UnitedforUkraine to convey opposite points of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ishaan|first=Tharoor|title=Russia hijacks U.S. State Department’s Ukraine hashtag|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/04/25/russia-hijacks-u-s-state-departments-ukraine-hashtag/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Foxnews.com|title=Obama's hashtag diplomacy with Russia sparks new criticism about weak foreign policy|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/04/26/obama-hashtag-diplomacy-with-russia-sparks-new-criticism-about-weak-foreign/|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Fox News|date=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tweeting to a global audience also poses challenges to leaders and diplomats.  In early 2014, Iranian President [[Hassan Rouhani]] decided to delete a controversial tweet that received much media attention, though it was likely intended for his domestic audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Loguirato|first=Brett|title=Iran's President Deleted A Controversial Tweet|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/hassan-rouhani-deletes-tweet-nuclear-deal-surrender-2014-1|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use by governments and intergovernmental organizations ==

Twiplomacy's 2013 study provided new insight into the use of Twitter by governments.  Twitter registration by region includes:&lt;ref name=twiplomacy /&gt;
* Africa: 71% of governments
* Asia:  75% of governments
* Europe: 100% of governments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tutt, A. (2013), E-Diplomacy Capacities within the EU-27: Small States and Social Media|url = http://www.grin.com/en/e-book/274032/e-diplomacy-capacities-within-the-eu-27-small-states-and-social-media|website = www.grin.com|accessdate = 2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* North America: 18 governments
* Oceania: 38% of governments
* South America: 92% of governments

=== By heads of state and government ===

Former US President [[Barack Obama]] is credited as being the first head of state to establish a Twitter account, originally affiliated with his [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]], on March 5, 2007 as user number 813,286.&lt;ref name=twiplomacy /&gt;  He was also the most followed head of state on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miles|first=Tom|title=@tweeter-in-chief? Obama's outsourced tweets top twitocracy|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/26/us-twitter-obama-idUSBRE86P0AQ20120726|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other heads of state and government to pioneer the conduct of Twitter diplomacy include Mexican president [[Enrique Peña Nieto]], Belgian Prime Minister [[Elio Di Rupo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tutt, A. (2013), E-Diplomacy Capacities within the EU-27: Small States and Social Media|url = http://www.grin.com/en/e-book/274032/e-diplomacy-capacities-within-the-eu-27-small-states-and-social-media|website = www.grin.com|accessdate = 2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]], all of whom joined Twitter in 2007.

Since his election in November 2016, US President [[Donald Trump]] has been actively [[Donald Trump on social media|engaged in]] Twitter diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCaskill|first1=Nolan|title=Clinton slams Trump's Twitter diplomacy: 'That doesn’t work'|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/02/hillary-clinton-mocks-trump-twitter-diplomacy-237884|accessdate=11 August 2017|work=[[Politico]]|date=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Rebecca Kheel|author2=Ellen Mitchell|title=Trump’s diplomacy-by-Twitter sets off firestorm|url=http://thehill.com/policy/defense/336659-trumps-diplomacy-by-twitter-sets-off-firestorm|accessdate=11 August 2017|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Apps|first1=Peter|title=Commentary: Trump’s brave new world of Twitter diplomacy|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-twitter-commentary-idUSKBN13U2VX|accessdate=11 August 2017|work=[[Reuters]]|issue=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Romero|first1=Luis Gomez|title=Twitter diplomacy: how Trump is using social media to spur a crisis with Mexico|url=https://theconversation.com/twitter-diplomacy-how-trump-is-using-social-media-to-spur-a-crisis-with-mexico-71981|accessdate=11 August 2017|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 11, 2017, for example, Trump tweeted, "Military solutions are now fully in place,locked and loaded, should [[North Korea]] act unwisely. Hopefully [[Kim Jong Un]] will find another path!"{{sic}}&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/895970429734711298&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By leaders of intergovernmental organizations ===

As of April 2014, the United Nations (UN) is the most followed intergovernmental organization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Twiplomacy|title=Twiplomacy 2013 - How International Organizations Tweet|url=http://twiplomacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Twiplomacy_organisations.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with its website showing over 2.56 million viewers in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations (UN) on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/UN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the UN's subordinate funds and agencies also attract large numbers of followers.  The [[United Nations Children's Fund]] achieved greater popularity than its parent organization, the UN, and is followed by over 2.69 million as of April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNICEF (UNICEF) on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By diplomats and diplomatic missions ===

Former Israeli ambassador to the United States, [[Michael Oren]], echoed the sentiment of many diplomats when responding to a May 2012 question about why he joined Twitter: "Today there are few alternatives as far-reachng and effective, with very wide audiences and young audiences, as Twitter. Twitter is another tool that enables me to communicate with other diplomats and journalists, while also allowing me to add a personal touch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tracy|first=Marc|title=Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren Talks About Why He Joined Twitter|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/101023/ambassadororen-on-why-he-joined-twitter|publisher=The Tablet|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign ministries have caught on, and some are making efforts to advertise their presence on Twitter.  The [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office]], for example, published a consolidated [https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office/about/social-media-use list] of all UK missions on social media.

The United States State Department, one of the leaders in digital diplomacy, maintains an active presence on Twitter.  Although former [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] encouraged American diplomats to tweet, she did not establish her personal handle until 2013, after she had already left office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Ken|title=Hillary Clinton starts Tweeting|url=http://www.myfoxny.com/story/22551202/hillary-clinton-joins-twitter|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=AP|date=2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045917/http://www.myfoxny.com/story/22551202/hillary-clinton-joins-twitter|archivedate=29 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Current Secretary [[John Kerry]] re-activated his personal Twitter handle after one year on the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gearan|first=Anne|title=John Kerry unleashed on Twitter once again|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/02/04/john-kerry-unleashed-on-twitter-once-again/|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Washington Post|date=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Former US ambassador to the Russian Federation, [[Michael McFaul]], pioneered the use of Twitter for American ambassadors with a steady stream of English/Russian tweets during his 2011–2014 tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Elder|first=Miriam|title=Michael McFaul, US ambassador to Moscow, victim of Kremlin 'Twitter war'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/29/michael-mcfaul-twitter-attack-russia|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Guardian|date=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lally"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lally|first=Kathy|title=U.S. ambassador in Moscow uses social media to bypass official line|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/moscow-ambassador-tweets-us-policy/2014/01/11/ac1fefea-7568-11e3-8b3f-b1666705ca3b_story.html|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Washington Post|date=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An academic by trade and not a career diplomat, Ambassador McFaul's tweets were generally blunt and un-polished—uncommon characteristics in the diplomatic world—earning both frequent criticism from the Russian government and praise from his supporters.&lt;ref name="Lally"/&gt;

[[File:Usine Bret MG 1638.jpg|thumb|Control room and schematics of the water purification plant to [[Lac de Bret]], Switzerland]]

'''Water purification''' is the process of removing undesirable chemicals, biological contaminants, suspended solids and gases from water. The goal is to produce water fit for a specific purpose. Most water is disinfected for human consumption ([[drinking water]]), but water purification may also be designed for a variety of other purposes, including fulfilling the requirements of medical, pharmacological, chemical and industrial applications. The methods used include physical processes such as [[filtration]], [[Sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]], and [[distillation]]; biological processes such as [[slow sand filters]] or [[activated carbon|biologically active carbon]]; chemical processes such as [[flocculation]] and [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] and the use of electromagnetic radiation such as [[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation|ultraviolet light]].

Purifying water may reduce the concentration of particulate matter including [[suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] [[Particle (ecology)|particle]]s, [[parasite]]s, [[bacteria]], [[algae]], [[virus]]es, [[fungi]], as well as reducing the concentration of a range of dissolved and particulate matter.

The standards for drinking [[water quality]] are typically set by governments or by international standards. These standards usually include minimum and maximum concentrations of contaminants, depending on the intended purpose of water use.

Visual inspection cannot determine if water is of appropriate quality. Simple procedures such as [[boiling]] or the use of a household [[activated carbon]] filter are not sufficient for treating all the possible contaminants that may be present in water from an unknown source. Even natural [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring water]] – considered safe for all practical purposes in the 19th century – must now be tested before determining what kind of treatment, if any, is needed. [[Analytical chemistry|Chemical]] and [[Bacteriological water analysis|microbiological analysis]], while expensive, are the only way to obtain the information necessary for deciding on the appropriate method of purification.

According to a 2007 [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) report, 1.1 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] people lack access to an improved drinking water supply; 88% of the 4 billion annual cases of [[diarrhea|diarrheal disease]] are attributed to unsafe water and inadequate [[sanitation]] and hygiene, while 1.8 million people die from diarrheal disease each year. The WHO estimates that 94% of these diarrheal disease cases are preventable through modifications to the environment, including access to safe water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/combating_diseasepart1lowres.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |title=Combating Waterborne Diseases at the Household Level |at=Part 1 |year=2007|isbn=978-92-4-159522-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple techniques for treating water at home, such as chlorination, filters, and solar disinfection, and storing it in safe containers could save a huge number of lives each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/waterforlife.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=World Health Organization and [[UNICEF]] |title=Water for Life: Making it Happen |year=2005 |isbn=978-92-4-156293-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing deaths from [[waterborne diseases]] is a major [[public health]] goal in developing countries.

==Sources of water==
{{further|Water supply}}
#[[Groundwater]]: The water emerging from some deep ground water may have fallen as rain many tens, hundreds, or thousands of years ago. [[Soil]] and rock layers naturally filter the ground water to a high degree of clarity and often, it does not require additional treatment besides adding [[chlorine]] or [[chloramines]] as secondary disinfectants. Such water may emerge as springs, [[Artesian aquifer|artesian spring]]s, or may be extracted from boreholes or wells. Deep ground water is generally of very high [[bacteria|bacteriological]] quality (i.e., pathogenic bacteria or the pathogenic protozoa are typically absent), but the water may be rich in dissolved solids, especially [[carbonate]]s and [[sulfate]]s of [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]]. Depending on the [[Stratum|strata]] through which the water has flowed, other ions may also be present including [[chloride]], and [[bicarbonate]]. There may be a requirement to reduce the [[iron]] or [[manganese]] content of this water to make it acceptable for drinking, cooking, and laundry use. Primary [[disinfection]] may also be required. Where [[groundwater recharge]] is practiced (a process in which river water is injected into an aquifer to store the water in times of plenty so that it is available in times of drought), the groundwater may require additional treatment depending on applicable state and federal regulations.
#Upland [[lake]]s and [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]]: Typically located in the headwaters of river systems, upland reservoirs are usually sited above any human habitation and may be surrounded by a protective zone to restrict the opportunities for contamination. Bacteria and pathogen levels are usually low, but some bacteria, [[protozoa]] or [[algae]] will be present. Where uplands are forested or peaty, [[humic acid]]s can colour the water. Many upland sources have low [[pH]] which require adjustment.
#[[River]]s, [[canal]]s and low land reservoirs: Low land surface waters will have a significant bacterial load and may also contain algae, suspended solids and a variety of dissolved constituents.
#[[Atmospheric water generator|Atmospheric water generation]] is a new technology that can provide high quality drinking water by extracting water from the air by cooling the air and thus condensing water vapor.
#[[Rainwater harvesting]] or [[fog collection]] which collect water from the atmosphere can be used especially in areas with significant dry seasons and in areas which experience fog even when there is little rain.
#[[Desalination]] of [[seawater]] by [[distillation]] or [[reverse osmosis]].
#[[Surface Water]]:  Freshwater bodies that are open to the atmosphere and are not designated as groundwater are termed surface waters.

==Treatment==

=== Goals ===
The goals of the treatment are to remove unwanted constituents in the water and to make it safe to drink or fit for a specific purpose in industry or medical applications. Widely varied techniques are available to remove contaminants like fine solids, micro-organisms and some dissolved inorganic and organic materials, or [[Environmental Persistent Pharmaceutical Pollutant|environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants]]. The choice of method will depend on the quality of the water being treated, the cost of the treatment process and the quality standards expected of the processed water.

The processes below are the ones commonly used in water purification plants. Some or most may not be used depending on the scale of the plant and quality of the raw (source) water.

===Pretreatment===
#Pumping and containment – The majority of water must be pumped from its source or directed into pipes or holding tanks. To avoid adding contaminants to the water, this physical infrastructure must be made from appropriate materials and constructed so that accidental contamination does not occur.
#Screening (''see also [[screen filter]]'') – The first step in purifying surface water is to remove large debris such as sticks, leaves, rubbish and other large particles which may interfere with subsequent purification steps. Most deep groundwater does not need screening before other purification steps.
#Storage – Water from rivers may also be stored in [[bankside reservoirs]] for periods between a few days and many months to allow natural biological purification to take place. This is especially important if treatment is by [[slow sand filter]]s. Storage reservoirs also provide a buffer against short periods of drought or to allow water supply to be maintained during transitory [[Water pollution|pollution]] incidents in the source river.
#Pre-chlorination – In many plants the incoming water was chlorinated to minimize the growth of fouling organisms on the pipe-work and tanks. Because of the potential adverse quality effects (see chlorine below), this has largely been discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGuire|first1=Michael J.|last2=McLain|first2=Jennifer Lara|last3=Obolensky|first3=Alexa|title=Information Collection Rule Data Analysis|date=2002|publisher=AWWA Research Foundation and American Water Works Association|location=Denver|isbn=9781583212738|pages=376–378|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQhSAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====pH adjustment====
Pure water has a [[pH]] close to 7 (neither [[alkaline]] nor [[acidic]]). [[Sea water]] can have  pH values that range from 7.5 to 8.4 (moderately alkaline). Fresh water can have widely ranging pH values depending on the geology of the [[drainage basin]] or [[aquifer]] and the influence of contaminant inputs ([[acid rain]]). If the water is acidic (lower than 7), [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[soda ash]], or [[sodium hydroxide]] can be added to raise the pH during water purification processes. Lime addition increases the calcium ion concentration, thus raising the water hardness. For highly acidic waters, forced draft [[Degasification|degasifiers]] can be an effective way to raise the pH, by stripping dissolved carbon dioxide from the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aeration and gas stripping|url=https://ocw.tudelft.nl/fileadmin/ocw/courses/DrinkingWaterTreatment1/res00071/embedded/!4165726174696f6e20616e642047617320537472697070696e6732303037.pdf|accessdate=29 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712085937/https://ocw.tudelft.nl/fileadmin/ocw/courses/DrinkingWaterTreatment1/res00071/embedded/!4165726174696f6e20616e642047617320537472697070696e6732303037.pdf|archivedate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making the water alkaline helps [[Coagulation (water treatment)|coagulation]] and [[flocculation]] processes work effectively and also helps to minimize the risk of [[lead]] being dissolved from lead pipes and from lead [[solder]] in pipe fittings.  Sufficient alkalinity also reduces the corrosiveness of water to iron pipes. Acid ([[carbonic acid gas|carbonic acid]], [[hydrochloric acid]] or [[sulfuric acid]]) may be added to alkaline waters in some circumstances to lower the pH. Alkaline water (above pH 7.0) does not necessarily mean that lead or copper from the plumbing system will not be dissolved into the water.  The ability of water to precipitate calcium carbonate to protect metal surfaces and reduce the likelihood of toxic metals being dissolved in water is a function of pH, mineral content, temperature, alkalinity and calcium concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Knowledge|url=https://www.awwa.org/resources-tools/water-knowledge.aspx|website=American Water Works Association|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coagulation and flocculation===
{{See also|particle aggregation}}

One of the first steps in most conventional water purification processes is the addition of chemicals to assist in the removal of particles suspended in water.  Particles can be inorganic such as [[clay]] and [[silt]] or organic such as [[algae]], [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], [[protozoa]] and [[natural organic matter]].  Inorganic and organic particles contribute to the [[turbidity]] and color of water.

The addition of inorganic coagulants such as [[aluminum sulfate]] (or [[alum#industrial|alum]]) or iron (III) salts such as [[iron(III) chloride]] cause several simultaneous chemical and physical interactions on and among the particles.  Within seconds, negative charges on the particles are neutralized by inorganic coagulants.  Also within seconds, metal hydroxide precipitates of the iron and aluminium ions begin to form.  These precipitates combine into larger particles under natural processes such as [[Brownian motion]] and through induced mixing which is sometimes referred to as [[flocculation]].  Amorphous metal hydroxides are known as "floc". Large, amorphous aluminum and iron (III) hydroxides adsorb and enmesh particles in suspension and facilitate the removal of particles by subsequent processes of [[sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]] and [[water filter|filtration]].&lt;ref name=Edzwald&gt;Edzwald, James K., ed. (2011). ''Water Quality and Treatment.'' 6th Edition. New York:McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|978-0-07-163011-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8.2–8.3}}

Aluminum hydroxides are formed within a fairly narrow pH range, typically:  5.5 to about 7.7.  Iron (III) hydroxides can form over a larger pH range including pH levels lower than are effective for alum, typically:  5.0 to 8.5.&lt;ref name=Crittenden&gt;Crittenden, John C., et al., eds. (2005). ''Water Treatment:  Principles and Design.'' 2nd Edition. Hoboken, NJ:Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-11018-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|679}}

In the literature, there is much debate and confusion over the usage of the terms coagulation and flocculation: Where does coagulation end and flocculation begin?  In water purification plants, there is usually a high energy, rapid mix unit process (detention time in seconds) whereby the coagulant chemicals are added followed by flocculation basins (detention times range from 15 to 45 minutes) where low energy inputs turn large paddles or other gentle mixing devices to enhance the formation of floc.  In fact, coagulation and flocculation processes are ongoing once the metal salt coagulants are added.&lt;ref name=Kawamura&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kawamura|first1=Susumu|title=Integrated Design and Operation of Water Treatment Facilities|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780471350934|pages=74–75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cOQKKRUNGrwC|date=2000-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|74–5}}

Organic polymers were developed in the 1960s as aids to coagulants and, in some cases, as replacements for the inorganic metal salt coagulants.  Synthetic organic polymers are high molecular weight compounds that carry negative, positive or neutral charges.  When organic polymers are added to water with particulates, the high molecular weight compounds adsorb onto particle surfaces and through interparticle bridging coalesce with other particles to form floc.  [[PolyDADMAC]] is a popular cationic (positively charged) organic polymer used in water purification plants.&lt;ref name=Crittenden/&gt;{{rp|667–8}}

===Sedimentation===
Waters exiting the flocculation basin may enter the [[settling basin|sedimentation basin]], also called a clarifier or settling basin. It is a large tank with low water velocities, allowing floc to settle to the bottom. The sedimentation basin is best located close to the flocculation basin so the transit between the two processes does not permit settlement or floc break up. Sedimentation basins may be rectangular, where water flows from end to end, or circular where flow is from the centre outward. Sedimentation basin outflow is typically over a weir so only a thin top layer of water—that furthest from the sludge—exits.

In 1904, [[Allen Hazen]] showed that the efficiency of a sedimentation process was a function of the particle settling velocity, the flow through the tank and the surface area of tank. Sedimentation tanks are typically designed within a range of overflow rates of 0.5 to 1.0 gallons per minute per square foot (or 1.25 to 2.5 meters per hour).  In general, sedimentation basin efficiency is not a function of detention time or depth of the basin.  Although, basin depth must be sufficient so that water currents do not disturb the sludge and settled particle interactions are promoted.  As particle concentrations in the settled water increase near the sludge surface on the bottom of the tank, settling velocities can increase due to collisions and agglomeration of particles.  Typical detention times for sedimentation vary from 1.5 to 4 hours and basin depths vary from 10 to 15 feet (3 to 4.5 meters).&lt;ref name=Edzwald /&gt;{{rp|9.39–9.40}}&lt;ref name=Crittenden/&gt;{{rp|790–1}}&lt;ref name=Kawamura/&gt;{{rp|140–2, 171}}

Inclined flat plates or tubes can be added to traditional sedimentation basins to improve particle removal performance.  Inclined plates and tubes drastically increase the surface area available for particles to be removed in concert with Hazen's original theory.  The amount of ground surface area occupied by a sedimentation basin with inclined plates or tubes can be far smaller than a conventional sedimentation basin.

====Sludge storage and removal====

As particles settle to the bottom of a sedimentation basin, a layer of [[sludge]] is formed on the floor of the tank which must be removed and treated. The amount of sludge generated is significant, often 3 to 5 percent of the total volume of water to be treated. The cost of treating and disposing of the sludge can impact the operating cost of a water treatment plant. The sedimentation basin may be equipped with mechanical cleaning devices that continually clean its bottom,  or the basin can be periodically taken out of service and cleaned manually.

====Floc blanket clarifiers====

A subcategory of sedimentation is the removal of particulates by entrapment in a layer of suspended floc as the water is forced upward.  The major advantage of floc blanket clarifiers is that they occupy a smaller footprint than conventional sedimentation.  Disadvantages are that particle removal efficiency can be highly variable depending on changes in influent water quality and influent water flow rate.&lt;ref name=Crittenden/&gt;{{rp|835–6}}

===Dissolved air flotation===
When particles to be removed do not settle out of solution easily, dissolved air flotation (DAF) is often used.   After coagulation and flocculation processes, water flows to DAF tanks where air diffusers on the tank bottom create fine bubbles that attach to floc resulting in a floating mass of concentrated floc.  The floating floc blanket is removed from the surface and clarified water is withdrawn from the bottom of the DAF tank.
Water supplies that are particularly vulnerable to unicellular algae blooms and supplies with low turbidity and high colour often employ DAF.
&lt;ref name=Edzwald /&gt;{{rp|9.46}}

===Filtration===
After separating most floc, the water is filtered as the final step to remove remaining suspended particles and unsettled floc.

====Rapid sand filters====
[[File:Rapid sand filter EPA.jpg|thumb|right|Cutaway view of a typical rapid sand filter]]
The most common type of filter is a [[rapid sand filter]]. Water moves vertically through sand which often has a layer of [[activated carbon]] or [[anthracite coal]] above the sand. The top layer removes organic compounds, which contribute to taste and odour. The space between sand particles is larger than the smallest suspended particles, so simple filtration is not enough. Most particles pass through surface layers but are trapped in pore spaces or adhere to sand particles. Effective filtration extends into the depth of the filter. This property of the filter is key to its operation: if the top layer of sand were to block all the particles, the filter would quickly clog.&lt;ref name="EPA1990"&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)(1990). Cincinnati, OH. [http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=300048WU.txt "Technologies for Upgrading Existing or Designing New Drinking Water Treatment Facilities."] Document no. EPA/625/4-89/023.&lt;/ref&gt;

To clean the filter, water is passed quickly upward through the filter, opposite the normal direction (called ''backflushing'' or ''[[Backwashing (water treatment)|backwashing]]'') to remove embedded or unwanted particles. Prior to this step, compressed air may be blown up through the bottom of the filter to break up the compacted filter media to aid the backwashing process; this is known as ''air scouring''. This contaminated water can be disposed of, along with the sludge from the sedimentation basin, or it can be recycled by mixing with the raw water entering the plant although this is often considered poor practice since it re-introduces an elevated concentration of bacteria into the raw water.

Some water treatment plants employ pressure filters. These work on the same principle as rapid gravity filters, differing in that the filter medium is enclosed in a steel vessel and the water is forced through it under pressure.

Advantages:

* Filters out much smaller particles than paper and sand filters can.
* Filters out virtually all particles larger than their specified pore sizes.
* They are quite thin and so liquids flow through them fairly rapidly.
* They are reasonably strong and so can withstand pressure differences across them of typically 2–5 atmospheres.
* They can be cleaned (back flushed) and reused.

====Slow sand filters====
[[File:Vsakovací nádrže umělé infiltrace v ÚV Káraný.jpg|thumb|Slow "artificial" filtration (a variation of [[bank filtration]]) to the ground, Water purification plant Káraný, Czech Republic]]
[[File:Slow sand filter profile.jpg|thumb|A profile of layers of gravel, sand and fine sand used in a slow sand filter plant.]]

[[Slow sand filter]]s may be used where there is sufficient land and space, as the water must be passed very slowly through the filters. These filters rely on biological treatment processes for their action rather than physical filtration. The filters are carefully constructed using graded layers of sand, with the coarsest sand, along with some gravel, at the bottom and finest sand at the top. Drains at the base convey treated water away for disinfection. Filtration depends on the development of a thin biological layer, called the zoogleal layer or [[Schmutzdecke]], on the surface of the filter. An effective slow sand filter may remain in service for many weeks or even months if the pretreatment is well designed and produces water with a very low available nutrient level which physical methods of treatment rarely achieve. Very low nutrient levels allow water to be safely sent through distribution systems with very low disinfectant levels, thereby reducing consumer irritation over offensive levels of chlorine and chlorine by-products. Slow sand filters are not backwashed; they are maintained by having the top layer of sand scraped off when flow is eventually obstructed by biological growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nair|first=Abhilash T.|last2=Ahammed|first2=M. Mansoor|last3=Davra|first3=Komal|date=2014-08-01|title=Influence of operating parameters on the performance of a household slow sand filter|journal=Water Science and Technology: Water Supply|volume=14|issue=4|pages=643–649|doi=10.2166/ws.2014.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A specific "large-scale" form of slow sand filter is the process of [[bank filtration]], in which natural sediments in a riverbank are used to provide a first stage of contaminant filtration. While typically not clean enough to be used directly for drinking water, the water gained from the associated extraction wells is much less problematic than river water taken directly from the major streams where bank filtration is often used.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===Membrane filtration===
[[Membrane technology|Membrane filters]] are widely used for filtering both drinking water and [[sewage]]. For drinking water, membrane filters can remove virtually all particles larger than 0.2&amp;nbsp;μm—including ''[[giardia]]'' and ''[[cryptosporidium]].'' Membrane filters are an effective form of tertiary treatment when it is desired to reuse the water for industry, for limited domestic purposes, or before discharging the water into a river that is used by towns further downstream. They are widely used in industry, particularly for beverage preparation (including [[bottled water]]). However no filtration can remove substances that are actually dissolved in the water such as [[phosphates]], [[nitrate]]s and [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] ions.

===Removal of ions and other dissolved substances===
[[Ultrafiltration]] [[artificial membrane|membranes]] use polymer membranes with chemically formed microscopic pores that can be used to filter out dissolved substances avoiding the use of coagulants. The type of membrane media determines how much pressure is needed to drive the water through and what sizes of micro-organisms can be filtered out.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

[[Ion exchange]]:&lt;ref name="Zagorodni"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zagorodni, Andrei A. |title=Ion exchange materials: properties and applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XfDFKl3I74MC|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-044552-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ion exchange systems use [[ion exchange resin]]- or [[zeolite]]-packed columns to replace unwanted ions. The most common case is [[water softening]] consisting of removal of [[calcium|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[magnesium|Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[ion]]s replacing them with benign (soap friendly) [[sodium|Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] or [[potassium|K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] ions. Ion exchange resins are also used to remove toxic ions such as [[nitrite]], [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[arsenic]] and many others.

[[Lime softening|Precipitative softening]]:&lt;ref name=Edzwald /&gt;{{rp|13.12–13.58}}  Water rich in [[hard water|hardness]] ([[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] ions) is treated with lime ([[calcium oxide]]) and/or soda-ash ([[sodium carbonate]]) to precipitate [[calcium carbonate]] out of solution utilizing the [[common-ion effect]].

[[Electrodeionization]]:&lt;ref name="Zagorodni"/&gt; Water is passed between a positive [[electrode]] and a negative electrode. Ion exchange [[Membrane (selective barrier)|membranes]] allow only positive ions to migrate from the treated water toward the negative electrode and only negative ions toward the positive electrode. High purity deionized water is produced continuously, similar to ion exchange treatment. Complete removal of ions from water is possible if the right conditions are met. The water is normally pre-treated with a [[reverse osmosis]] unit to remove non-ionic [[organic contaminants]], and with gas transfer membranes to remove [[carbon dioxide]]. A water recovery of 99% is possible if the concentrate stream is fed to the RO inlet.

===Disinfection===
[[File:Chemical pumps at water purification plant.JPG|thumb|Pumps used to add required amount of chemicals to the clear water at the water purification plant before the distribution. From left to right: sodium hypochlorite for disinfection, zinc orthophosphate as a corrosion inhibitor, sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment, and fluoride for tooth decay prevention.]]

Disinfection is accomplished both by filtering out harmful micro-organisms and also by adding disinfectant chemicals. Water is disinfected to kill any [[pathogens]] which pass through the filters and to  provide a residual dose of disinfectant to kill or inactivate potentially harmful micro-organisms in the storage and distribution systems.  Possible pathogens include [[viruses]], [[bacteria]], including  ''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Cholera]]'',  ''[[Campylobacter]]'' and ''[[Shigella]]'', and [[protozoa]], including ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'' and other ''[[cryptosporidia]]''.  Following the introduction of any chemical disinfecting agent, the water is usually held in temporary storage – often called a contact tank or [[clear well]] to allow the disinfecting action to complete.

====Chlorine disinfection====
{{Main|Water chlorination}}
The most common disinfection method involves some form of [[chlorine]] or its compounds such as [[chloramine]] or [[chlorine dioxide]]. Chlorine is a strong [[oxidizer|oxidant]] that rapidly kills many harmful micro-organisms. Because chlorine is a toxic gas, there is a danger of a release associated with its use. This problem is avoided by the use of [[sodium hypochlorite]], which is a relatively inexpensive solution used in household bleach that releases free chlorine when dissolved in water. Chlorine solutions can be generated on site by electrolyzing common salt solutions. A solid form, [[calcium hypochlorite]], releases chlorine on contact with water. Handling the solid, however, requires greater routine human contact through opening bags and pouring than the use of gas cylinders or bleach which are more easily automated. The generation of liquid sodium hypochlorite is both inexpensive and safer than the use of gas or solid chlorine. Chlorine levels up to 4 milligrams per liter (4 parts per million) are considered safe in drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/public/chlorine-disinfection.html|publisher=CDC|accessdate=11 February 2018|title=Disinfection with Chlorine &amp;#124; Public Water Systems &amp;#124; Drinking Water &amp;#124; Healthy Water }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All forms of chlorine are widely used, despite their respective drawbacks. One drawback is that chlorine from any source reacts with natural organic compounds in the water to form potentially harmful chemical by-products. These by-products, [[trihalomethane]]s (THMs) and [[haloacetic acid]]s (HAAs), are both [[carcinogenic]] in large quantities and are regulated by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and the [[Drinking Water Inspectorate]] in the UK. The formation of THMs and haloacetic acids may be minimized by effective removal of as many organics from the water as possible prior to chlorine addition. Although chlorine is effective in killing bacteria, it has limited effectiveness against pathogenic protozoa that form cysts in water such as ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'' and ''[[Cryptosporidium]]''.

====Chlorine dioxide disinfection====
[[Chlorine dioxide]] is a faster-acting disinfectant than elemental chlorine. It is relatively rarely used, because in some circumstances it may create excessive amounts of [[chlorite]], which is a by-product regulated to low allowable levels in the United States. Chlorine dioxide can be supplied as an aqueous solution and added to water to avoid gas handling problems; chlorine dioxide gas accumulations may spontaneously detonate.

====Chloramine disinfection====
The use of chloramine is becoming more common as a disinfectant. Although chloramine is not as strong an oxidant, it does provide a longer-lasting residual than free chlorine and it will not readily form THMs or haloacetic acids. It is possible to convert chlorine to chloramine by adding [[ammonia]] to the water after addition of chlorine. The chlorine and ammonia react to form chloramine. Water distribution systems disinfected with chloramines may experience [[nitrification]], as ammonia is a nutrient for bacterial growth, with nitrates being generated as a by-product.

====Ozone disinfection====
[[Ozone]] is an unstable molecule which readily gives up one atom of oxygen providing a powerful oxidizing agent which is toxic to most waterborne organisms. It is a very strong, broad spectrum disinfectant that is widely used in Europe. It is an effective method to inactivate harmful protozoa that form cysts. It also works well against almost all other pathogens. Ozone is made by passing oxygen through ultraviolet light or a "cold" electrical discharge. To use ozone as a disinfectant, it must be created on-site and added to the water by bubble contact. Some of the advantages of ozone include the production of fewer dangerous by-products and the absence of taste and odour problems (in comparison to [[Water chlorination|chlorination]]). Another advantage of ozone is that it leaves no residual disinfectant in the water. Ozone has been used in drinking water plants since 1906 where the first industrial ozonation plant was built in [[Nice]], France. The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] has accepted ozone as being safe; and it is applied as an anti-microbiological agent for the treatment, storage, and processing of foods. However, although fewer by-products are formed by ozonation, it has been discovered that ozone reacts with bromide ions in water to produce concentrations of the suspected carcinogen [[bromate]].  Bromide can be found in fresh water supplies in sufficient concentrations to produce (after ozonation) more than 10 parts per billion (ppb) of bromate — the maximum contaminant level established by the USEPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Neemann, Jeff |author2=Hulsey, Robert |author3=Rexing, David |author4=Wert, Eric |year=2004|title=Controlling Bromate Formation During Ozonation with Chlorine and Ammonia|journal=Journal American Water Works Association|volume= 96|issue=2 |pages=26–29|doi=10.1002/j.1551-8833.2004.tb10542.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ultraviolet disinfection====
{{main|Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation}}[[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation|Ultraviolet light]] (UV) is very effective at inactivating cysts, in low turbidity water. UV light's disinfection effectiveness decreases as turbidity increases, a result of the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], [[scattering]], and shadowing caused by the suspended solids. The main disadvantage to the use of UV radiation is that, like ozone treatment, it leaves no residual disinfectant in the water; therefore, it is sometimes necessary to add a residual disinfectant after the primary disinfection process. This is often done through the addition of chloramines, discussed above as a primary disinfectant. When used in this manner, chloramines provide an effective residual disinfectant with very few of the negative effects of chlorination.

===Portable water purification===
{{main|Portable water purification}}
Potable water purification devices and methods are available for disinfection and treatment in emergencies or in remote locations. Disinfection is the primary goal, since aesthetic considerations such as taste, odour, appearance, and trace chemical contamination do not affect the short-term safety of drinking water.

===Additional treatment options===
#[[Water fluoridation]]: in many areas [[fluoride]] is added to water with the goal of preventing [[tooth decay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Recommendations for using fluoride to prevent and control dental decay caries in the United States |author= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |journal= MMWR Recomm Rep |volume=50 |issue=RR-14 |pages=1–42 |year=2001 |pmid=11521913 |url=http://cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5014a1.htm |laysummary=http://cdc.gov/fluoridation/guidelines/tooth_decay.htm |laysource=CDC |laydate=2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluoride is usually added after the disinfection process.

#Water conditioning: This is a method of reducing the effects of hard water. In water systems subject to heating hardness salts can be deposited as the decomposition of bicarbonate ions creates carbonate ions that precipitate out of  solution. Water with high concentrations of hardness salts can be treated with soda ash (sodium carbonate) which precipitates out the excess salts, through the [[common-ion effect]], producing calcium carbonate of very high purity. The precipitated calcium carbonate is traditionally sold to the manufacturers of [[toothpaste]]. Several other methods of industrial and residential water treatment are claimed (without general scientific acceptance) to include the use of magnetic and/or electrical fields reducing the effects of hard water.&lt;ref&gt;Penn State Extension [http://extension.psu.edu/natural-resources/water/drinking-water/water-testing/water-treatment/magnetic-water-treatment-devices "Magnetic Water Treatment Devices"] Accessed 15.08.2017&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Plumbosolvency]] reduction: In areas with naturally acidic waters of low conductivity (i.e. surface rainfall in upland mountains of [[igneous]] rocks), the water may be capable of dissolving [[lead]] from any lead pipes that it is carried in. The addition of small quantities of [[phosphate]] ion and increasing the [[pH]] slightly both assist in greatly reducing plumbo-solvency by creating insoluble lead salts on the inner surfaces of the pipes.
#Radium Removal: Some groundwater sources contain [[radium]], a radioactive chemical element. Typical sources include many groundwater sources north of the [[Illinois River]] in [[Illinois]]. Radium can be removed by ion exchange, or by water conditioning. The back flush or sludge that is produced is, however, a low-level [[radioactive waste]].
#Fluoride Removal: Although fluoride is added to water in many areas, some areas of the world have excessive levels of natural fluoride in the source water. Excessive levels can be [[Fluoride toxicity|toxic]] or cause undesirable cosmetic effects such as staining of teeth. Methods of reducing fluoride levels is through treatment with [[activated alumina]] and [[bone char]] filter media.

==Other water purification techniques==
Other popular methods for purifying water, especially for local private supplies are listed below. In some countries some of these methods are also used for large scale municipal supplies. Particularly important are distillation (de-salination of seawater) and reverse osmosis.

# [[Boiled Water|Boiling]]: Bringing water to its [[boiling point]] (about 100&amp;nbsp;°C or 212 F at sea level), is the oldest and most effective way since it eliminates most [[microbes]] causing [[intestine]] related diseases,&lt;ref name=Oxfordjournals&gt;{{cite journal|title=Water Disinfection for International and Wilderness Travelers|author=Backer, Howard |pages=355–364|doi=10.1086/324747|year=2002| journal=Clin Infect Dis |volume= 34 |issue=3 |pmid=11774083}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it cannot remove [[toxins|chemical toxins]] or impurities.&lt;ref name="backpackers field manual"&gt;Curtis, Rick (1998) [http://www.princeton.edu/~oa/manual/water.shtml OA Guide to Water Purification, The Backpacker's Field Manual], Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; For human health, complete [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]] of water is not required, since the heat resistant microbes are not intestine affecting.&lt;ref name="Oxfordjournals"/&gt; The traditional advice of boiling water for ten minutes is mainly for additional safety, since microbes start getting eliminated at temperatures greater than {{convert|60|°C}}. Though the [[Atmospheric pressure boiling point|boiling point decreases]] with increasing altitude, it is not enough to affect the disinfecting process.&lt;ref name="Oxfordjournals"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is it true that you can't make a decent cup of tea up a mountain?|url=http://www.physics.org/facts/air-tea.asp|publisher=physics.org| accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas where the water is "hard" (that is, containing significant dissolved calcium salts), boiling decomposes the [[bicarbonate]] ions, resulting in partial precipitation as [[calcium carbonate]]. This is the "fur" that builds up on kettle elements, etc., in hard water areas. With the exception of calcium, boiling does not remove solutes of higher boiling point than water and in fact increases their concentration (due to some water being lost as vapour). Boiling does not leave a residual disinfectant in the water. Therefore, water that is boiled and then stored for any length of time may acquire new pathogens.
# Granular Activated Carbon adsorption: a form of [[activated carbon]] with a high surface area, adsorbs many compounds including many toxic compounds. Water passing through [[activated carbon]] is commonly used in municipal regions with organic contamination, taste or odors. Many household water filters and fish tanks use activated carbon filters to further purify the water. Household filters for drinking water sometimes contain [[silver]] as metallic [[silver nanoparticle]]. If water is held in the carbon block for longer periods, microorganisms can grow inside which results in fouling and contamination. Silver nanoparticles are excellent anti-bacterial material and they can decompose toxic halo-organic compounds such as pesticides into non-toxic organic products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Savage|first=Nora|author2=Mamadou S. Diallo |title=Nanomaterials and Water Purification: Opportunities and Challenges|journal=J.

#[[Distillation]] involves boiling the water to produce water [[vapour]]. The vapour contacts a cool surface where it condenses as a liquid. Because the solutes are not normally vaporised, they remain in the boiling solution. Even distillation does not completely purify water, because of contaminants with similar boiling points and droplets of unvapourised liquid carried with the steam. However, 99.9% pure water can be obtained by distillation.
#[[Reverse osmosis]]: Mechanical pressure is applied to an impure solution to force pure water through a [[semi-permeable membrane]]. Reverse osmosis is theoretically the most thorough method of large scale water purification available, although perfect semi-permeable membranes are difficult to create. Unless membranes are well-maintained, [[algae]] and other life forms can colonize the membranes.

# Direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD). Applicable to desalination. Heated seawater is passed along the surface of a [[hydrophobic]] [[polymer]] membrane. Evaporated water passes from the hot side through pores in the membrane into a stream of cold pure water on the other side. The difference in vapour pressure between the hot and cold side helps to push water molecules through.
#[[Desalination]] –  is a process by which saline water (generally sea water) is converted to fresh water. The most common desalination processes are distillation and reverse osmosis. Desalination is currently expensive compared to most alternative sources of water, and only a very small fraction of total human use is satisfied by desalination. It is only economically practical for high-valued uses (such as household and industrial uses) in arid areas.  
# Gas hydrate crystals centrifuge method.

Many municipalities have moved from free chlorine to chloramine as a disinfection agent. However, chloramine appears to be a corrosive agent in some water systems. Chloramine can dissolve the "protective" film inside older service lines, leading to the leaching of lead into residential spigots. This can result in harmful exposure, including elevated [[blood lead levels]]. Lead is a known [[neurotoxin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Demineralized water===
Distillation removes all minerals from water, and the membrane methods of reverse osmosis and nanofiltration remove most to all minerals. This results in demineralized water which is not considered ideal [[drinking water]]. The World Health Organization has investigated the health effects of demineralized water since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutdemineralized.pdf Health risks from drinking demineralised water]. (PDF) . Rolling revision of the WHO Guidelines for
drinking-water quality. World Health Organization, Geneva, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments in humans found that demineralized water increased [[Fluid balance|diuresis]] and the elimination of [[electrolyte]]s, with decreased [[blood serum]] [[potassium]] concentration. [[Magnesium]], [[calcium]], and other minerals in water can help to protect against nutritional deficiency. Demineralized water may also increase the risk from toxic metals because it more readily leaches materials from piping like lead and cadmium, which is prevented by dissolved minerals such as calcium and magnesium. Low-mineral water has been implicated in specific cases of lead poisoning in infants, when lead from pipes leached at especially high rates into the water.

==History==
{{Further|History of water supply and sanitation}}
[[File:Jakob Ziegler 1799 Bemerkungen über gemeines Wasser detail.jpg | thumb|Drawing of an apparatus for studying the chemical analysis of mineral waters in a book from 1799.]]
The first experiments into water filtration were made in the 17th century. Sir [[Francis Bacon]] attempted to [[desalination|desalinate]] sea water by passing the flow through a [[sand filter]]. Although his experiment did not succeed, it marked the beginning of a new interest in the field. The fathers of [[microscopy]], [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] and [[Robert Hooke]], used the newly invented [[microscope]] to observe for the first time small material particles that lay suspended in the water, laying the groundwork for the future understanding of waterborne pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofwaterfilters.com/microscope-in-water.html|title=The Use of the Microscope in Water Filter History|work=History of Water Filters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sand filter===
[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|Original map by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] showing the [[Cluster (epidemiology)|clusters]] of [[cholera]] cases in the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak|London epidemic of 1854]].]]
The first documented use of [[sand filter]]s to purify the water supply dates to 1804, when the owner of a bleachery in [[Paisley, Scotland]], John Gibb, installed an experimental filter, selling his unwanted surplus to the public.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/ssf2.pdf|title=Filtration of water supplies|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method was refined in the following two decades by engineers working for private water companies, and it culminated in the first treated public water supply in the world, installed by engineer [[James Simpson (engineer)|James Simpson]] for the [[Chelsea Waterworks Company]] in London in 1829.&lt;ref name="History of the Chelsea Waterworks"&gt;[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/1859map/chelsea_waterworks_a2.html History of the Chelsea Waterworks]. ucla.edu&lt;/ref&gt; This installation provided filtered water for every resident of the area, and the network design was widely copied throughout the [[United Kingdom]] in the ensuing decades.

The practice of water treatment soon became mainstream and common, and the virtues of the system were made starkly apparent after the investigations of the physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] during the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]]. Snow was sceptical of the then-dominant [[miasma theory]] that stated that diseases were caused by noxious "bad airs". Although the [[germ theory of disease]] had not yet been developed, Snow's observations led him to discount the prevailing theory. His 1855 essay ''On the Mode of Communication of Cholera'' conclusively demonstrated the role of the water supply in spreading the cholera epidemic in [[Soho]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gunn, S. William A.  |author2=Masellis, Michele  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Concepts and Practice of Humanitarian Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1exE1cfKXIC&amp;pg=PA87|date=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-72264-1|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bazin, Hervé |title=L'histoire des vaccinations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NSHXLkgFBBQC&amp;pg=PA290|year=2008|publisher=John Libbey Eurotext|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the use of a [[dot distribution map]] and statistical proof to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases. His data convinced the local council to disable the water pump, which promptly ended the outbreak.

The [[Metropolis Water Act 1852|Metropolis Water Act]] introduced the regulation of the [[water supply]] companies in [[London]], including minimum standards of water quality for the first time. The Act "made provision for securing the supply to the Metropolis of pure and wholesome water", and required that all water be "effectually filtered" from 31 December 1855.&lt;ref&gt;''An Act to make better Provision respecting the Supply of Water to the Metropolis'', (15 &amp; 16 Vict. C.84)&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed up with legislation for the mandatory inspection of water quality, including comprehensive chemical analyses, in 1858. This legislation set a worldwide precedent for similar state public health interventions across [[Europe]]. The [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers]] was formed at the same time, water filtration was adopted throughout the country, and new water intakes on the [[Thames]] were established above [[Teddington Lock]]. Automatic pressure filters, where the water is forced under pressure through the filtration system, were innovated in 1899 in England.&lt;ref name="WHO" /&gt;

===Water chlorination===
[[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] was the first to successfully use [[chlorine]] to [[water chlorination|disinfect the water supply]] in [[Soho]] that had helped spread the cholera outbreak. William Soper also used chlorinated lime to treat the sewage produced by [[typhoid]] patients in 1879.

In a paper published in 1894, [[Moritz Traube]] formally proposed the addition of chloride of lime ([[calcium hypochlorite]]) to water to render it "germ-free."  Two other investigators confirmed Traube's findings and published their papers in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Turneaure, F.E. |author2=H.L. Russell  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1901 | title = Public Water-Supplies:  Requirements, Resources, and the Construction of Works | edition = 1st | location = New York | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | page = 493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early attempts at implementing water chlorination at a water treatment plant were made in 1893 in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]] and in 1897 the city of [[Maidstone]] [[England]] was the first to have its entire water supply treated with chlorine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Typhoid Epidemic at Maidstone|date=October 1897|journal=Journal of the Sanitary Institute|volume=18|pages=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Permanent water chlorination began in 1905, when a faulty [[slow sand filter]] and a contaminated water supply led to a serious typhoid fever epidemic in [[Lincoln, England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icis.com/Articles/2008/08/25/9150211/chlorine-cleans-water-for-millions-but-comes-under-attack-after-health.html|title=A miracle for public health?|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Alexander Cruickshank Houston used chlorination of the water to stem the epidemic. His installation fed a concentrated solution of chloride of lime to the water being treated. The chlorination of the water supply helped stop the epidemic and as a precaution, the chlorination was continued until 1911 when a new water supply was instituted.&lt;ref&gt;Reece, R.J. (1907). "Report on the Epidemic of Enteric Fever in the City of Lincoln, 1904-5." In Thirty-Fifth Annual Report of the Local Government Board, 1905-6:  Supplement Containing the Report of the Medical Officer for 1905-6. London:Local Government Board.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manual Control Chlorinator.jpg|thumb|Manual-control chlorinator for the liquefaction of chlorine for water purification, early 20th century. From ''Chlorination of Water'' by Joseph Race, 1918.]]
The first continuous use of chlorine in the [[United States]] for disinfection took place in 1908 at Boonton Reservoir (on the [[Rockaway River]]), which served as the supply for [[Jersey City, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Leal, John L. (1909). "The Sterilization Plant of the Jersey City Water Supply Company at Boonton, N.J." ''Proceedings'' American Water Works Association. pp. 100–9.&lt;/ref&gt;   Chlorination was achieved by controlled additions of dilute solutions of chloride of lime ([[calcium hypochlorite]]) at doses of 0.2 to 0.35 ppm.  The treatment process was conceived by Dr. John L. Leal and the chlorination plant was designed by [[George W. Fuller|George Warren Fuller.]]&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, George W. (1909). "Description of the Process and Plant of the Jersey City Water Supply Company for the Sterilization of the Water of the Boonton Reservoir." ''Proceedings'' AWWA. pp. 110–34.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the next few years, chlorine disinfection using chloride of lime were rapidly installed in drinking water systems around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hazen, Allen. (1916). ''Clean Water and How to Get It.'' New York:Wiley. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique of purification of drinking water by use of compressed liquefied chlorine gas was developed by a British officer in the [[Indian Medical Service]], Vincent B. Nesfield, in 1903. According to his own account: {{quote|It occurred to me that chlorine gas might be found satisfactory ... if suitable means could be found for using it.... The next important question was how to render the gas portable. This might be accomplished in two ways: By liquefying it, and storing it in lead-lined iron vessels, having a jet with a very fine capillary canal, and fitted with a tap or a screw cap. The tap is turned on, and the cylinder placed in the amount of water required. The chlorine bubbles out, and in ten to fifteen minutes the water is absolutely safe. This method would be of use on a large scale, as for service water carts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Nesfield, V. B. |title=A Chemical Method of Sterilizing Water Without Affecting its Potability|url=http://www.publichealthjrnl.com/article/S0033-3506%2802%2980142-1/abstract|journal=Public Health|volume=15|year=1902|pages=601–3|doi=10.1016/s0033-3506(02)80142-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

U.S. Army Major [[Carl Rogers Darnall]], Professor of Chemistry at the [[Army Medical School]], gave the first practical demonstration of this in 1910. Shortly thereafter, Major William J. L. Lyster of the [[Army Medical Department (United States)|Army Medical Department]] used a solution of [[calcium hypochlorite]] in a linen bag to treat water. For many decades, Lyster's method remained the standard for U.S. ground forces in the field and in camps, implemented in the form of the familiar Lyster Bag (also spelled Lister Bag). This work became the basis for present day systems of municipal water ''purification''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2686">The '''William Alanson White Institute''', founded in 1943,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wawhite.org/index.php?page=our-history|title=Our History|website=www.wawhite.org|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an institution for training [[psychoanalysts]] and [[psychotherapists]]. It is located in [[New York City]], United States, on the Upper West Side, in the [[Clara Thompson]] building.

The William Alanson White Institute (WAWI) has explored new territory in psychoanalytic theory and praxis, breaking away in protest in the middle of the last century from the mainstream of [[United States|American]] psychoanalytic thought, which was thought constrictive by the psychoanalysts who founded the institute.

The founders of WAWI are [[Erich Fromm]] and [[Clara Thompson]], joined by [[Harry Stack Sullivan]], [[Frieda Fromm-Reichmann]], [[David Rioch]] and [[Janet Rioch]].  The William Alanson White Institute emphasizes psychoanalytic activism in relation to issues of importance in culture and society, and addresses problems of living which are considered to be beyond the scope of classical psychoanalysis.  WAWI is strongly influenced by the work of [[Sándor Ferenczi]], a member of Freud's inner circle who pioneered the analyst's authentic use of himself in the consulting room, emphasizing the mutuality of the relationship between therapist and client.

In 2001, the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]] presented its first Psychoanalytic Community Clinic of the Year Award to the Clinical Service of the William Alanson White Institute for providing very high quality [[psychotherapy]] at a modest price to people suffering from [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[personality disorders]], [[eating disorders]], and other psychological problems.

WAWI offers training programs, continuing education and clinical services, including hosting conferences, lecture series, and symposia.  It publishes the journal ''[[Contemporary Psychoanalysis]]''. The journal reports advances in the application of [[psychotherapy]] and [[psychoanalysis]] to [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[personality disorders]], conflicts about [[sex]] and [[gender]], and other psychological problems.

[[File:Shepherds Flat Wind Farm 2011.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The [[Shepherds Flat Wind Farm]] is an 845&amp;nbsp;MW wind farm in the U.S. state of [[Oregon]].]]

A '''wind farm''' or '''wind park''' is a group of [[wind turbine]]s in the same location used to produce electricity. A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. A wind farm can also be located offshore.

Many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in China, India, and the United States. For example, the [[List of onshore wind farms|largest wind farm in the world]], [[Gansu Wind Farm]] in China has a capacity of over 6,000&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt|MW]] as of 2012,&lt;ref name="Guardian-2012.03.19"&gt;Watts, Jonathan &amp; Huang, Cecily.

Retrieved 4 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; with a goal of 20,000&amp;nbsp;MW by 2020.

Individual wind turbine designs continue to increase in power, resulting in fewer turbines being needed for the same total output. See [[List of most powerful wind turbines|list of most powerful wind turbines]].

== Design and location ==
[[File:United States Wind Resources and Transmission Lines map.jpg|thumb|Map of available wind power over the United States. Color codes indicate wind power density class]]
The location is critical to the success of a wind farm. Conditions contributing to a successful wind farm location include: wind conditions, access to electric transmission, physical access, and local electric prices.

The faster the average windspeed the more electricity the wind turbine will generate, so faster winds are economically better for wind farm developers. The balancing factor is that strong gusts and high turbulence require stronger more expensive turbines, otherwise they risk damage. The ideal wind conditions would be strong steady winds with low turbulence coming from a single direction.

Usually sites are screened on the basis of a [[wind atlas]], and validated with wind measurements. [[Meteorology|Meteorological]] wind data alone is usually not sufficient for accurate siting of a large wind power project. Collection of site specific data for wind speed and direction is crucial to determining site potential&lt;ref name=eweaFact&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W0dre8-5FAYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=da Wind energy-- the facts: a guide to the technology, economics and future of wind power] page 32 ''[[EWEA]]'' 2009.

[[File:Biglow Canyon Wind Farm under construction.jpg|thumb|Part of the [[Biglow Canyon Wind Farm]], [[Oregon]], United States with a turbine under construction]]
The wind blows faster at higher altitudes because of the reduced influence of drag. The increase in velocity with altitude is most dramatic near the surface and is affected by topography, surface roughness, and upwind obstacles such as trees or buildings.

How closely to space the turbines together is a major factor in wind farm design. The closer the turbines are together the more the upwind turbines block wind from their neighbors. However spacing turbines far apart increases the costs of roads and cables, and raises the amount of land needed to install a specific capacity of turbines. As a result of these factors, turbine spacing varies by site. Generally speaking manufacturers require 3.5 times the rotor diameter of the turbine between turbines as a minimum. Closer spacing is possible depending on the turbine model, the conditions at the site, and how the site will be operated.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

[[wikt:onshore|Onshore]] turbine installations in hilly or mountainous regions tend to be on ridges generally three kilometres or more inland from the nearest shoreline. This is done to exploit the [[topographic acceleration]] as the wind accelerates over a ridge. The additional wind speeds gained in this way can increase energy produced because more wind goes through the turbines. The exact position of each turbine matters, because a difference of 30m could potentially double output. This careful placement is referred to as 'micro-siting'.

== Offshore installations ==

{{See also|Offshore wind power|List of offshore wind farms|Lists of offshore wind farms by country}}

Europe is the leader in offshore wind energy, with [[Vindeby Offshore Wind Farm|the first offshore wind farm (Vindeby)]] being installed in Denmark in 1991. As of 2010, there are 39 offshore wind farms in waters off Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, with a combined operating capacity of 2,396 MW. More than 100 GW (or 100,000 MW) of offshore projects are proposed or under development in Europe. The [[European Wind Energy Association]] has set a target of 40 GW installed by 2020 and 150 GW by 2030.&lt;ref name=eesi2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eesi.org/files/offshore_wind_101310.pdf |title=Offshore Wind Energy |author=Environmental and Energy Study Institute |author-link=Environmental and Energy Study Institute |date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Asof|2017}}, The [[Walney Wind Farm]] in the United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 659 [[Megawatt|MW]], followed by the [[London Array]] (630 MW) also in the UK.

Offshore wind turbines are less obtrusive than turbines on land, as their apparent size and noise is mitigated by distance. Because water has less surface roughness than land (especially deeper water), the average wind speed is usually considerably higher over open water. [[Capacity factor]]s (utilisation rates) are considerably higher than for onshore locations.&lt;ref name="Garvinel2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garvine | first1 = Richard | last2 = Kempton | first2 = Willett | title = Assessing the wind field over the continental shelf as a resource for electric power | journal = Journal of Marine Research | year = 2008 | volume = 66 | issue = 6 | pages = 751–773 | issn = 0022-2402 | url = http://www.ceoe.udel.edu/windpower/docs/GarvineKemp-AssessingWind09.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 30 November 2009 | doi = 10.1357/002224008788064540 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720083622/http://www.ceoe.udel.edu/windpower/docs/GarvineKemp-AssessingWind09.pdf | archivedate = 20 July 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, there were no offshore wind farms in the United States, but projects were under development in wind-rich areas of the East Coast, Great Lakes, and Pacific coast;&lt;ref name=eesi2010/&gt; and in late 2016 the [[Block Island Wind Farm]] was commissioned.

Installation and service / maintenance of off-shore wind farms are a specific challenge for technology and economic operation of a wind farm. {{asof|2015}}, there are 20 [[Jackup rig|jackup vessels]] for lifting components, but few can lift sizes above 5MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tu.no/industri/skip/2016/01/15/slik-utstyres-de-norske-skipene-for-a-takle-nye-gigant-vindmoller|title=Slik utstyres de norske skipene for å takle nye gigant-vindmøller|author=Jannicke Nilsen|work=Tu.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Service vessels have to be operated nearly 24/7 (availability higher than 80% of time) to get sufficient amortisation from the wind turbines.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Therefore, special fast service vehicles for installation (like Wind Turbine Shuttle) as well as for maintenance (including heave compensation and heave compensated working platforms to allow the service staff to enter the wind turbine also at difficult weather conditions) are required. So-called inertial and optical based Ship Stabilization and Motion Control systems (iSSMC) are used for that.

== Experimental and proposed wind farms ==
There exist also some wind farms which were mainly built for testing wind turbines. In such wind farms, there is usually from each type to be tested only a single wind turbine. Such farms have usually at least one meteorological tower. An example of an experimental wind farm is [[Østerild Wind Turbine Test Field]].

For some time, airborne wind farms have been discussed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/AWES_Farm_Density.pdf AWES Farm Density] ''Airborne Wind Energy Labs'', March 2014. Retrieved 20 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; An airborne wind farm is a group of airborne wind energy systems near to each other, connected to the grid in the same point.

According to the [[Global Wind Energy Council]], the development of wind energy in China, in terms of scale and rhythm, is absolutely unparalleled in the world. The [[National People's Congress]] permanent committee passed a law that requires the Chinese energy companies to purchase all the electricity produced by the renewable energy sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.instalbiz.com/news/3-full-news-cn-china-ranks-third-in-worldwide-wind-energy_129.html |title=CN : China ranks third in worldwide wind energy – Alternative energy news |publisher=Instalbiz.com |date=4 January 2010 |accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europe's largest windfarm is the '[[London Array]]', an off-shore wind farm in the [[Thames Estuary]] in the [[United Kingdom]], with a current capacity of 630 MW (the world's largest off-shore wind farm). Other large wind farms in Europe include [[Fântânele-Cogealac Wind Farm]] near [[Constanța]], Romania with 600 MW capacity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.cez.cz/en/power-plants-and-environment/wind-power-plant/fantanele-cegealac-wind-park.html | title= Fantanele-Cogealac Wind Park | publisher= Cez Group | accessdate= 14 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://praguemonitor.com/2012/10/12/%C4%8Dez-says-its-wind-farm-romania-biggest-europe | title= ČEZ says its wind farm in Romania is the biggest in Europe | work= Prague Daily Monitor | date= 12 October 2012 | accessdate= 12 October 2012 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130522083617/http://praguemonitor.com/2012/10/12/%C4%8Dez-says-its-wind-farm-romania-biggest-Europe | archive-date= 22 May 2013 | dead-url= yes | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Whitelee Wind Farm]] near [[Glasgow]], Scotland which has a total capacity of 539 MW.

An important limiting factor of wind power is [[intermittent power source|variable power]] generated by wind farms. In most locations the wind blows only part of the time, which means that there has to be back-up capacity of conventional generating capacity to cover periods that the wind is not blowing. To address this issue it has been proposed to create a "[[European super grid|supergrid]]" to connect national grids together&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/16595/|title=A Supergrid for Europe|work=MIT Technology Review|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; across [[western Europe]], ranging from Denmark across the southern [[North Sea]] to England and the [[Celtic Sea]] to Ireland, and further south to France and Spain especially in [[Higueruela]] which was for some time the biggest wind farm in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=David Cifuentes |last-author-amp=yes |author2=Víctor M. Rodríguez |url=http://www.sabuco.com/mci/essays01/2b/energy2.pdf |title=Renewable energy |page=11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203093335/http://www.sabuco.com/mci/essays01/2b/energy2.pdf |archive-date=2007-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that by the time a [[low pressure area]] has moved away from Denmark to the [[Baltic Sea]] the next low appears off the coast of Ireland. Therefore, while it is true that the wind is not blowing everywhere all of the time, it will always be blowing somewhere.

===Pakistan===
[[File:Jhimpir Wind Farm 2012.jpg|thumb|Jhimpir Wind Farm]]
Pakistan has wind corridors in Jhimpir, Gharo and Keti Bundar in Sindh province and is currently developing wind power plants in Jhimpir and Mirpur Sakro (District Thatta). The government of Pakistan decided to develop wind power energy sources due to problems supplying energy to the southern coastal regions of Sindh and Balochistan.
The Zorlu Energy Putin Power Plant is the first wind power plant in Pakistan. The wind farm is being developed in Jhimpir, by Zorlu Energy Pakistan the local subsidiary of a Turkish company. The total cost of project is $136 million.[3] Completed in 2012, it has a total capacity of around 56MW.
Fauji Fertilizer Company Energy Limited, has build a 49.5 MW wind Energy Farm at Jhimpir. Contract of supply of mechanical design was awarded to Nordex and Descon Engineering Limited. Nordex a German wind turbine manufacturer. In the end of 2011 49.6 MW will be completed.Pakistani Govt. also has issued LOI of 100 MW Wind power plant to FFCEL. Pakistani Govt. has plans to achieve electric power up to 2500 MW by the end of 2015 from wind energy to bring down energy shortage.

Currently four wind farms are operational (Fauji Fertilizer 49.5 MW (subsidiary of Fauji Foundation), Three Gorges 49.5 MW, Zorlu Energy Pakistan 56 MW, Sapphire Wind Power Co Ltd 52.6 MW) and six are under construction phase ( Master Wind Energy Ltd 52.6 MW, Sachal Energy Development Ltd 49.5 MW, Yunus Energy Ltd 49.5 MW, Gul Energy 49.5 MW, Metro Energy 49.5 MW, Tapal Energy ) and expected to achieve COD in 2017.

In Gharo wind corridor, two wind farms (Foundation Energy 1 &amp; II each 49.5 MW) are operational while two wind farms Tenaga Generasi Ltd 49.5 MW and HydroChina Dawood Power Pvt Ltd 49.5 are under construction and expected to achieve COD in 2017.

According to a USAID report, Pakistan has the potential of producing 150,000 megawatts of wind energy, of which only the Sindh corridor can produce 40,000 megawatts.

===Philippines===
The Philippines has the first windfarm in Southeast Asia. Located Northern part of the countries' biggest island Luzon, alongside the seashore of [[Bangui, Ilocos Norte|Bangui]], [[Ilocos Norte]].

The wind farm uses 20 units of 70-metre (230&amp;nbsp;ft) high Vestas V82 1.65 MW wind turbines, arranged on a single row stretching along a nine-kilometer shoreline off Bangui Bay, facing the West Philippine Sea.

Phase I of the NorthWind power project in Bangui Bay consists of 15 wind turbines, each capable of producing electricity up to a maximum capacity of 1.65 MW, for a total of 24.75 MW. The 15 on-shore turbines are spaced 326 metres (1,070&amp;nbsp;ft) apart, each 70 metres (230&amp;nbsp;ft) high, with 41 metres (135&amp;nbsp;ft) long blades, with a rotor diameter of 82 metres (269&amp;nbsp;ft) and a wind swept area of 5,281 square metres (56,840 sq ft). Phase II, was completed on August 2008, and added 5 more wind turbines with the same capacity, and brought the total capacity to 33 MW. All 20 turbines describes a graceful arc reflecting the shoreline of Bangui Bay, facing the West Philippine Sea.

Adjacent municipalities of [[Burgos, Ilocos Norte|Burgos]] and [[Pagudpud]] followed with 50 and 27 wind turbines with a capacity of 3 MW each for a Total of 150 MW and 81 MW respectively.

Two other wind farms were built outside of Ilocos Norte, the [[Pililla Wind Farm]] in Rizal and the [[Mindoro Wind Farm]] near [[Puerto Galera]] in [[Oriental Mindoro]].

===Sri Lanka===

Sri Lanka has received funding from the Asian Development Bank amounting to $300 million to invest in renewable energies. From this funding as well as $80 million from the Sri Lankan Government and $60 million from France’s Agence Française de Développement, Sri Lanka is building two 100MW wind farms from 2017 due to be completed by late 2020 in Northern Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.lk/2014/07/16/adb-grants-300-m-to-boost-renewable-energy/|title=ADB grants $ 300 m to boost renewable energy|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518083210/http://www.ft.lk/2014/07/16/adb-grants-300-m-to-boost-renewable-energy/|archive-date=18 May 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Public perception is that renewable energies such as wind, solar, biomass and geothermal are having a significant positive impact on global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/23/people-want-more-renewable-energy |title=Nine out of 10 people want more renewable energy |date=23 April 2012 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these sources combined only supplied 1.3% of global energy in 2013 as 8 billion tonnes of coal was burned annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/REN12-GSR2015_Onlinebook_low1.pdf |title=Renewables 2015 Global Status Report |publisher=[[REN21]] |year=2015 |accessdate=2015-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721013559/http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/REN12-GSR2015_Onlinebook_low1.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2015 |df= |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest factors inhibiting wind farm construction is human opposition. A study has shown&lt;ref&gt;Groth, Theresa M., and Christine A. Vogt. "Rural wind farm development: Social, environmental and economic features important to local residents." Renewable Energy 63.2014 (2013): 1-8. ScienceDirect. Web. 9 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; "turbine placement close to residents may heighten their uncertainty and concern of the wind turbines and overshadow any positive inclinations towards the development."

Wind farm development is affected by the emphasis being primarily placed on the domain of landscape assessment and environmental impact when seeking farm sites. The viability and efficiency of the wind farm are barely touched upon, instead falling to the developer. For example, Sturge et al.&lt;ref&gt;Sturge, D., A. While, and R. Howell. "Engineering and energy yield: The missing dimension of wind turbine assessment." Energy Policy 65.2014 (2013): 245-50. ScienceDirect. Web. 9 Feb. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; of the University of Sheffield wrote that in many countries where wind energy is becoming popular, engineering aspects, specifically energy yield are not being taken into consideration, either by the public or in the process of planning consent for wind farm development. As energy is the main purpose of wind farms, a lack of attention given to the subject could be detrimental to the general acceptance of wind farms.

Compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources, the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor.&lt;ref name="Guezuraga37"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Begoña Guezuraga |author2=Rudolf Zauner |author3=Werner Pölz |title=Life cycle assessment of two different 2 MW class wind turbines |journal=[[Renewable Energy (journal)|Renewable Energy]] |volume=37 |issue=1 |date=January 2012 |page=37 |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2011.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind power]] consumes no fuel, and emits no [[air pollution]], unlike fossil fuel power sources. The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months.&lt;ref name="Guezuraga37"/&gt; While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use.&lt;ref name=mar&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/WindPowersStrength.pdf |title=Why Australia needs wind power |author=Mark Diesendorf |journal=Dissent |issue=13 |date=Summer 2003 |pages=43-48 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706112239/http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/WindPowersStrength.pdf |archive-date=6 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human health ===
{{See also|Health effects from noise}}
There have been multiple scientific, peer-reviewed studies into wind farm noise, which have concluded that infrasound from wind farms is not a hazard to human health and there is no verifiable evidence for 'Wind Turbine Syndrome' causing [[Vibroacoustic disease]], although some suggest further research might still be useful.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cleanenergycouncil.org.au/dam/cec/technologies/wind/fact-sheets/Wind-farms-and-health-fact-sheet-Jan-2015/Wind%20farms%20and%20health%20fact%20sheet%20-%20Jan%202015.pdf 'Wind Energy - The Facts', p. 1].&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 report by the U.S. National Research Council noted that noise produced by wind turbines is generally not a major concern for humans beyond a half-mile or so. Low-frequency vibration and its effects on humans are not well understood and sensitivity to such vibration resulting from wind-turbine noise is highly variable among humans.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} There are opposing views on this subject, and more research needs to be done on the effects of low-frequency noise on humans.&lt;ref name="NRC1"&gt;Committee on Environmental Impacts of Wind Energy Projects, National Research Council (2007). [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11935&amp;page=158 ''Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects'', p. 158-9].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2009 report about "Rural Wind Farms", a Standing Committee of the Parliament of New South Wales, Australia, recommended a minimum setback of two kilometres between wind turbines and neighbouring houses (which can be waived by the affected neighbour) as a precautionary approach.&lt;ref name="NSW1"&gt;General Purpose Standing Committee No. 5, Parliament of New South Wales (16 December 2009). [http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Prod/parlment/committee.nsf/0/ea247659081d31fdca25768e001a2e2a/$FILE/091216%20Report%20-%20Rural%20wind%20farms.pdf "Final Report, Rural Wind Farms"].&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 paper suggests that the 'Wind Turbine Syndrome' is mainly caused by the [[nocebo]] effect and other psychological mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Novella2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=GJ|last2=Burns|first2=M|last3=Wessely|first3=S|authorlink3=Simon Wessely|title=Possible psychological mechanisms for "wind turbine syndrome".

=== Effect on power grid ===
{{See also|Wind power#Electricity generation}}

Utility-scale wind farms must have access to transmission lines to transport energy. The wind farm developer may be obliged to install extra equipment or control systems in the wind farm to meet the technical standards set by the operator of a transmission line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BUFFALO GAP WIND FARM, L.L.C., BUFFALO GAP WIND FARM 2, L.L.C., AND BUFFALO GAP WIND FARM 3, L.L.C.'S APPEAL AND COMPLAINT OF ERCOT'S DECISION AND ACTION REGARDING PRR 830 AND MOTION FOR SUSPENSION OF ACTION|url=http://www.ercot.com/content/about/governance/legal/notices/37827_Buffalo_Gap_Wind_Farm_Appeal_Complaint_PRR_830.pdf|website=ERCOT.com|publisher=ERCOT|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company or person that develops the wind farm can then sell the power on the grid through the transmission lines and ultimately chooses whether to hold on to the rights or sell the farm or parts of it to big business like GE, for example.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

=== Ground radar interference ===
[[File:NOAA windturbine-radar-interference.gif|thumb|Wind farm interference (in yellow circle) on radar map]]

Wind farms can interfere with ground [[radar]] systems used for [[military]], [[Weather radar|weather]] and [[air traffic control]]. The large, rapidly moving blades of the turbines can return signals to the radar that can be mistaken as an aircraft or weather pattern.&lt;ref name="noaaWR"&gt;[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/mkx/?n=windfarm Wind farm interference showing up on Doppler radar] ''[[National Weather Service]]''.

==== Effects ====
The level of interference is a function of the signal processors used within the radar, the speed of the aircraft and the relative orientation of wind turbines/aircraft with respect to the radar. An aircraft flying above the wind farm's turning blades could become impossible to detect because the blade tips can be moving at nearly aircraft velocity. Studies are currently being performed to determine the level of this interference and will be used in future site planning.&lt;ref name="gsnWR"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodwin|first= Jacob|url= http://www.gsnmagazine.com/node/22124?c=airport_aviation_security |title=DHS asks Raytheon to study impact of wind turbines on radar systems|website=gsnmagazine.com|date= 3 January 2011|accessdate= 9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues include masking (shadowing), clutter (noise), and signal alteration.&lt;ref name="wefWR"&gt;[http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/de/environment/chapter-2-environmental-impacts/ship-collisions-radars-and-radio-signals.html Radars and radio signals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407155949/http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/de/environment/chapter-2-environmental-impacts/ship-collisions-radars-and-radio-signals.html |date=7 April 2011 }} ''Wind Energy Facts''.

Wind turbines can often cause terrestrial television interference when the direct path between television transmitter and receiver is blocked by terrain. Interference effects become significant when the reflected signal from the turbine blades approaches the strength of the direct unreflected signal. Reflected signals from the turbine blades can cause loss of picture, pixellation and disrupted sound. There is a common misunderstanding that digital TV signals will not be affected by turbines — in practice they are.

A 2010 study found that in the immediate vicinity of wind farms, the climate is cooler during the day and slightly warmer during the night than the surrounding areas due to the turbulence generated by the blades.&lt;ref name=agriwind1&gt;Roy, Somnath Baidya. [http://www.pnas.org/content/107/42/17899.abstract?sid=47909b69-b82f-49d4-97d9-debb5d1ff65b Impacts of wind farms on surface air temperatures] ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'', 4 October 2010. Retrieved 10 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study an analysis carried out on [[corn]] and [[soybean]] crops in the central areas of the United States noted that the microclimate generated by wind turbines improves crops as it prevents the late spring and early autumn frosts, and also reduces the action of pathogenic fungi that grow on the leaves. Even at the height of summer heat, the lowering of 2.5–3 degrees above the crops due to turbulence caused by the blades, can make a difference for the cultivation of corn.&lt;ref name=agriwind2&gt;Takle, Gene and Lundquist, Julie.
