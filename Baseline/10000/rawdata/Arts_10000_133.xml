The women's sack-back gowns and the men's coats over long waistcoats are characteristic of this period.]]
'''Fashion in the years 1750–1775''' in European countries and the colonial Americas was characterised by greater abundance, elaboration and intricacy in clothing designs, loved by the [[Rococo]] artistic trends of the period. The French and English styles of fashion were very different from one another. French style was defined by elaborate court dress, colourful and rich in decoration, worn by such iconic fashion figures as [[Marie Antoinette]].

After reaching their maximum size in the 1750s, [[hoop skirt]]s began to reduce in size, but remained being worn with the most formal dresses, and were sometimes replaced with side-hoops, or [[Pannier (clothing)|pannier]]s.&lt;ref name=methoop&gt;"Panniers [British] (1973.65.2)". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1973.65.2 (October 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Hairstyles were equally elaborate, with tall headdresses the distinctive fashion of the 1770s. For men, [[waistcoat]]s and [[breeches]] of previous decades continued to be fashionable.

English style was defined by simple practical garments, made of inexpensive and durable fabrics, catering to a leisurely outdoor lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Ribeiro, Aileen 1820"&gt;Ribeiro, Aileen: ''The Art of Dress: Fashion in England and France 1750–1820'', Yale University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0300062877}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lifestyles were also portrayed through the differences in portraiture. The French preferred indoor scenes where they could demonstrate their affinity for luxury in dress and lifestyle. The English, on the other hand, were more "egalitarian" in tastes, thus their portraits tended to depict the sitter in outdoor scenes and pastoral attire.&lt;ref&gt;Ribeiro. ''The Art of Dress''. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women's fashion ==

=== Overview ===
[[File:Jean-Marc Nattier 003.jpg|right|thumb|[[Princess Henriette of France]] in court dress playing the [[viola de gamba]], {{circa|1750–52}}, by [[Jean-Marc Nattier]]]]
[[File:Batoni lady mary fox.jpg|right|thumb|Lady Mary Fox wears a grey silk hooded Brunswick gown with striped ribbon ornaments, 1767]]
Women's clothing styles retained the emphasis on a narrow, inverted conical torso, achieved with boned stays, above full skirts. [[Hoop skirt]]s continued to be worn, reaching their largest size in the 1750s, and were sometimes replaced by side-hoops, also called 'false hips', or [[Pannier (clothing)|panniers]].&lt;ref name=methoop/&gt; Court dress had little or no physical comfort with restriction of movement. Full size hoops skirts prevented sitting and reminded those wearing them to stand in the presence of the King. Stays forced a proper standing posture. Garments like these could not be washed often because of the fabrics from which they were made. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] produced a backlash against [[sumptuary law]]s which asserted a stagnant social hierarchy. During the Enlightenment, court dress stayed almost the same while outside of court dress, fashion became less extravagant and shifted more towards comfort rather than courtly display.&lt;ref&gt;McNeil, ''The Appearance of Enlightenment''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gowns ===
The usual fashion of the years 1750–1775 was a low-necked [[gown]] (usually called a {{lang|fr|robe}}), worn over a petticoat. Most gowns had skirts that opened in front to show the petticoat worn beneath. If the bodice of the gown was open in front, the opening was filled in with a decorative [[stomacher]], pinned to the gown over the laces or to the stays beneath.

Close-fitting sleeves just past the elbow were trimmed with frills or ruffles, and separate under-ruffles referred to as [[engageante]]s in modern terms, of lace or fine linen were [[tack (sewing)|tacked]], to the inside of the gown's sleeves,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fineartlib.info/gallery/p17_sectionid/10/p17_imageid/899|title=Mrs. Richard Skinner :: John Singleton Copley - 4 women's portraits 18th century hall|website=www.fineartlib.info|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or perhaps to the [[chemise|shift or chemise]] sleeves. The neckline was trimmed with a fabric or lace ruffle, or a neckerchief called a "[[fichu]]" could be tucked into the low neckline. Women would also sometimes wear a neckerchief or a more formal lace modesty piece, particularly on low-cut dresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/European-Culture-18th-Century/Eighteenth-Century-Clothing.html|title=Eighteenth-Century Clothing|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{lang|fr|robe à la française}} or [[sack-back gown]] featured back pleats hanging loosely from the neckline. A fitted bodice held the front of the gown closely to the figure.

The {{lang|fr|robe à l'anglaise}} or [[close-bodied gown]] featured back pleats sewn in place to fit closely to the body, and then released into the skirt which would be draped in various ways.

The [[Brunswick (clothing)|Brunswick]] dress was a two-piece costume of German origin consisting of a hip-length jacket with "split sleeves"—flounced elbow-length sleeves and long, tight lower sleeves—and a hood, worn with a matching petticoat. It was popular for traveling.

Court dress, the {{lang|fr|grand habit de cour}} or "stiff-bodied" gown, retained the styles of the 1670s. It featured a low, oval neckline that bared the shoulders, and the heavily boned bodice laced closed in back, unlike the front-opening robe. The elbow-length sleeves were covered with tiers of lace flounces, echoing the full-sleeved chemise worn with the original style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waugh|first=Norah|title=The Cut of Women's Clothes: 1600–1930|year=1968|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0878300260|pages=66–67, 69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Front-wrapping thigh-length "shortgowns" or [[bedgown]]s of lightweight printed cotton fabric were fashionable at-home morning wear, worn with petticoats. Over time, bedgowns became the staple upper garment of British and American female working-class street wear.&lt;ref&gt;Baumgarten, ''What Clothes Reveal'', pp. 116–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in previous periods, the traditional [[riding habit]] consisted of a tailored jacket like a man's coat, worn with a high-necked shirt, a waistcoat, a petticoat, and a hat. Alternatively, the jacket and a false waistcoat-front might be a made as a single garment, and later in the period a simpler riding jacket and petticoat—without waistcoat—could be worn.

=== Underwear ===
The shift, [[chemise]] (in France), or smock, had a low neckline and elbow-length sleeves which were full early in the period and became increasingly narrow as the century progressed. [[Undergarment|Drawers]] were not worn in this period.

The long-waisted, heavily boned "stays" of the [[1700–1750 in fashion|early 1740s]] with their narrow back, wide front, and shoulder straps gave way by the 1760s to strapless stays which still were cut high at the armpit, to encourage a woman to stand with her shoulders slightly back, a fashionable posture. The fashionable shape was a rather conical torso, with large hips. The waist was not particularly small. Stays were laced snugly, but comfortably. They offered back support for heavy lifting, and poor and middle class women were able to work comfortably in them.

Free-hanging pockets were tied around the waist and were accessed through "pocket slits" in the side-seams of the gown or petticoat.

Woollen or quilted waistcoats were worn over the stays and under the gown for warmth, as were petticoats quilted with wool batting, especially in the cold climates of northern Europe and America. In the 1770s stays began to be produced so they would end higher on a woman's body. Phillip Vicker complained: "For the late importation of Stays which are said to be now most fashionable in London, are produced upwards so high that we can have scarce any view at all of the Ladies Snowy Bosoms..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://makinghistorynow.com/2016/01/musings-from-the-millinery-revealing-the-truth-about-18th-century-womens-necklines/|title=Musings from the millinery: revealing the truth about 18th-century women's necklines|website=Making History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Woman's yellow silk shoes 1760s.jpg|thumb|Woman's yellow silk shoe to be worn with shoe buckle, {{circa|1760–65}}]]

=== Shoes ===
Shoes had high, curved heels—the origin of modern "louis heels"—and were made of fabric or leather, with separate [[shoe buckle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tortora &amp; Eubank 1995, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; These were either shiny metal, usually in silver—sometimes with the metal cut into false stones in the Paris style—or with paste stones, although there were other types.

=== Hairstyles and headgear ===
By the 1770s extreme hairstyles and [[Wig (hair)|wigs]] had come into fashion. Women wore their hair high upon their heads, in large plumes. To create tall extreme hair, rolls of horse hair, tow, or wool were used to raise up the front of the hair. The front of the hair was then frizzed out, or arranged in roll curls and set horizontally on the head. Women turned their hair up in the back often in a knot. In addition, pomatum and false hair was used to give more height to the hair. Pomatum was paste that women used to stiffen their hair. Pomatum was also used to hold powder, which women put in their hair. The Pomatum was made of many ingredients including hog's grease, tallow, or a mix of beef marrow and oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Courtais|first=Georgine de|title=Women's hats, headdresses, and hairstyles: with 453 illustrations, medieval to modern|date=2006|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, N.Y.|isbn=0486448509|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{-}}

=== Overview ===
Throughout the period, men continued to wear the [[coat (clothing)|coat]], [[waistcoat]] and [[breeches]] of the [[1700–1750 in fashion|previous period]]. However, changes were seen in both the fabric used as well as the cut of these garments. More attention was paid to individual pieces of the suit, and each element underwent stylistic changes.&lt;ref name="Ribeiro, Aileen 1820"/&gt; Under new enthusiasms for outdoor sports and country pursuits, the elaborately [[embroider]]ed silks and velvets characteristic of "full dress" or formal attire earlier in the century gradually gave way to carefully [[tailor]]ed woollen "undress" garments for all occasions except the most formal. This more casual style reflected the dominating image of "nonchalance." The goal was to look as fashionable as possible with seemingly little effort. This was to be the new, predominant mindset of fashion.

=== Coats ===
The skirts of the coat narrowed from the gored styles of the previous period. Waistcoats extended to mid-thigh to the 1770s and then began to shorten. Waistcoats could be made with or without sleeves.&lt;ref name="Ribeiro, Aileen 1820"/&gt;

As in the previous period, a loose, T-shaped silk, cotton or linen gown called a [[banyan (clothing)|banyan]] was worn at home as a sort of dressing gown over the shirt, waistcoat, and breeches. Men of an intellectual or philosophical bent were painted wearing banyans, with their own hair or a soft cap rather than a wig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Franklin and Friends|accessdate=2006-03-19|url=http://www.npg.si.edu/exh/franklin/rush.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A coat with a wide collar called a [[frock coat]], derived from a traditional working-class coat, was worn for hunting and other country pursuits in both Britain and America.&lt;ref name="Ribeiro, Aileen 1820"/&gt;

=== Shirt and stock ===
[[Shirt]] sleeves were full, gathered at the wrist and dropped shoulder. Full-dress shirts had ruffles of fine fabric or lace, while undress shirts ended in plain wrist bands.&lt;ref name="Ribeiro, Aileen 1820"/&gt;

=== Breeches, shoes, and stockings ===
Knee-length breeches fitted snugly and had a fall-front opening.

Low-heeled leather [[shoe]]s fastened with [[shoe buckle|buckles]] were worn with silk or woollen [[stocking]]s. [[Boot]]s were worn for riding. The buckles were either polished metal, usually in silver—sometimes with the metal cut into false stones in the Paris style—or with paste stones, although there were other types. These buckles were often quite large and one of the world's largest collections can be seen at [[Kenwood House]].

=== Hairstyles and headgear ===
Wigs were worn for formal occasions, or the hair was worn long and powdered, brushed back from the forehead and "clubbed" (tied back at the nape of the neck) with a black ribbon. Wigs were generally now short, but long wigs continued to be popular with the older generation. Wigs were made with a lot of white powder.

Wide-brimmed hats turned up on three sides called "cocked hats"—called [[tricorne|tricorns]] in later eras—were worn in mid-century.{{-|left}}

=== The macaroni ===
{{main|Macaroni (fashion)}}
[[File:Philip Dawe, The Macaroni. A Real Character at the Late Masquerade (1773).jpg|thumb|1773 caricature of the exaggerated style of the macaroni]]
The trend of the macaroni grew out of the tradition of those who partook of the [[Grand Tour]]. Elite men in the 18th century would travel abroad across Europe, namely Italy, to broaden their cultural depth. These men adopted foreign fashions and tastes and brought them back to England where they interpreted them further.&lt;ref&gt;Amelia Rauser, ''Hair, Authenticity, The Self Made Macaroni'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, Fall 2004) p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The original macaroni of the 1760s was characterized by elaborate dress consisting of short and tight trousers, large wigs, delicate shoes and small hats.&lt;ref&gt;Rauser 2004, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; As the general population of English males became exposed to the luxurious appeal of the macaroni trend, they began to adopt and replicate the trends they saw. By the 1770s, any man could appear as if they themselves had been on the Grand Tour-based solely on their outward appearance.

The macaroni and the subsequent imitators were criticized for being [[Androgyny|gender ambiguous]] and [[effeminacy|effeminate]].&lt;ref&gt;S. West, ''The Darly Macaroni Prints and the Politics of the Private Man'', Duke University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently, the macaroni fashion trend was the subject of satirical caricatures and pamphlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chenoune|first=Farid|title=A History of Men's Fashion|date=1993|publisher=Flammarion|location=Paris|isbn=9782080135360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their large costume like wigs and short coats, which deeply contrasted the masculine British dress of the time, were ridiculed for their frivolity and were said to be threatening the stability of gender difference, thereby undermining the nation's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Rauser 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The question of farce and inauthenticity comes into play as well because by dressing as a macaroni, one claimed the status and the means of an elite who went on the Grand Tour.

Although many mocked the macaroni for their outwardly eccentric characteristics, some celebrated them for their commitment to the demonstration of personal identity. The idea of a unique character was becoming an important concept that spanned many types of media including books and prints as Britain wanted to distinguish itself from France.&lt;ref&gt;West, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Children's fashion ==
During most of this period, the clothes worn by middle- and upper-class children older than toddlers continued to be similar to the clothes worn by adults, with the exception that girls wore back-fastening bodices and petticoats rather than open-fronted robes. Boys wore dresses until they were [[breeching (boys)|breeched]].

== Working class clothing ==
[[File:Hogarths-Servants.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Portraits of [[William Hogarth]]'s servants (England, 1750s)]]
[[File:John Collet The Elopement detail.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|A working-class woman wears a short dress or [[bedgown]], a patched and mended petticoat, and neckerchief (England, {{circa|1764}})]]
Working-class people in 18th century England and the United States often wore the same garments as fashionable people—shirts, waistcoats, coats and breeches for men, and shifts, petticoats, and dresses or jackets for women—but they owned fewer clothes and what they did own was made of cheaper and sturdier fabrics. Working class men also wore short jackets, and some, especially sailors, wore trousers rather than breeches. [[Smock-frock]]s were a regional style for men, especially shepherds. Country women wore short hooded cloaks, most often red. Both sexes wore handkerchiefs or neckerchiefs.&lt;ref name="Styles"&gt;Styles, ''The Dress of the People'', pp. 32–36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reveal"&gt;Baumgarten, ''What Clothes Reveal'', pp. 106–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Men's felt hats were worn with the brims flat rather than cocked or turned up. Men and women wore shoes with shoe buckles—when they could afford them. Men who worked with horses wore boots.&lt;ref name="Styles" /&gt;

'''''A Sea–Spell''''' is an 1877 [[oil painting]] and accompanying 1869 [[sonnet]] by [[England|English]] artist [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], depicting a [[siren (mythology)|siren]] playing an instrument to lure sailors. It is currently on display in the [[Harvard Art Museums]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].

Rossetti's brother described the subject as "a Siren, or Sea-Fairy, whose lute summons a sea-bird to listen, and whose song will prove fatal to some fascinated mariner."&lt;ref name="McGann"/&gt;

===Execution===
[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti - La viuda romana (Dîs Manibus).jpg|thumb|Rossetti's ''The Roman Widow'' (1874), a companion work to ''A Sea–Spell'']]
In 1873, Rossetti made a drawing of a sea-maiden playing an instrument, titled ''[[Siren_(mythology)#List_of_Sirens|Ligeia]] Siren'', as a preliminary study for ''A Sea–Spell''.&lt;ref name="Delphi"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dante Gabriel Rossetti|title=Delphi Complete Poetical Works of Dante Gabriel Rossetti (Illustrated)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BPyzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT760|date=2 June 2014|publisher=Delphi Classics|pages=760–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had begun work on the painting itself by 18 August 1875.&lt;ref name="Fredeman"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dante Gabriel Rossetti|author2=William Evan Fredeman|title=The Correspondence of Dante Gabriel Rossetti|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a8ciRhA1NPUC&amp;pg=PA638|year=2002|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=978-1-84384-060-2|pages=619, 638, 645}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother [[William Michael Rossetti]] wrote that Gabriel painted the work, along with another [[half-length figure]] painting called ''[[The Roman Widow]]'', after his patron [[Frederick Richards Leyland]] "suggested" that he was interested in buying several such paintings. Leyland later denied making a commitment to do so.&lt;ref name="Fredeman"/&gt;

The model was [[Alexa Wilding]], one of Rossetti's several muses.&lt;ref name="Fredeman"/&gt; ''A Sea–Spell'' was a companion to ''[[Veronica Veronese]]'', for which Wilding also modeled.&lt;ref name="Spence"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spence|first=Cathryn|editor=Jill Berk Jiminez|title=Dictionary of Artists' Models|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogFYAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA570|date=15 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-95914-2|pages=570–|chapter=Wilding, Alexa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Agosta"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Animate Images: The Later Poem-Paintings of Dante Gabriel Rossetti |last=Agosta |first=Lucien L. |journal=Texas Studies in Literature and Language |volume=23 |issue=1 |year=1981 |pages=78–101 |publisher=University of Texas Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rossetti was assisted by an unidentified [[naturalist]] in finding and positioning the [[taxidermy|stuffed]] seagull used in the painting, which led to some delay.&lt;ref name="Fredeman"/&gt;

==Poem==
Rossetti wrote a [[sonnet]] in 1869 as a "double" of the painting completed years later, as he did for several other works in the same period.&lt;ref name="McGann"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dante Gabriel Rossetti|author2=Jerome J. McGann|title=Collected Poetry and Prose|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dbthC7tDYC4C&amp;pg=PA396|year=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-09802-0|page=396}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnston1969"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert DeSales Johnston|title=Dante Gabriel Rossetti|year=1969|publisher=Twayne Publishers|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text of the poem is as follows:
&lt;poem&gt;
Her lute hangs shadowed in the apple-tree,
:While flashing fingers weave the sweet-strung spell
:Between its chords; and as the wild notes swell,
The sea-bird for those branches leaves the sea.
But to what sound her listening ear stoops she?
:What netherworld gulf-whispers doth she hear,
:In answering echoes from what planisphere,
Along the wind, along the estuary?

She sinks into her spell: and when full soon
:Her lips move and she soars into her song,
:What creatures of the midmost main shall throng
In furrowed surf-clouds to the summoning rune:
:Till he, the fated mariner, hears her cry,
:And up her rock, bare-breasted, comes to die?&lt;ref&gt;Rossetti &amp; McGann 2003, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=dbthC7tDYC4C&amp;pg=PA192 192-193]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Critical reception and analysis==
[[File:Veronica Veronese DAM.jpg|thumb|''[[Veronica Veronese]]'' (1872), another companion to ''A Sea–Spell'']]
[[Jerome McGann]] wrote that the painting is a "failure", caused by Rossetti's excessive intellectualizing of his work; previous critics suggested, to the contrary, that the work is flawed due to Rossetti's "slipshod" execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review: Rethinking Rossetti (review of "Dante Gabriel Rossetti and the Game that Must be Lost", by Jerome McGann)|last=Frith |first=Richard |journal=The Cambridge Quarterly |volume= 32 |issue= 1|year=2003  |pages=81–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Helene E. Roberts wrote that the painting is one of a group of depictions of Rossetti's "ideal woman". She wrote that the iconic image of womanhood dominated Rossetti's "dream world", and that the painting is intended to evoke similar reveries in the viewer, citing its musical theme as a prompt for "indolent musing". She argued that, although the combination of daydreaming and womanhood in ''A Sea–Spell'' could be [[pornography|pornographic]], Rossetti encourages more spiritual responses, emphasizing the subject's face and making her exposed arms "masculine, or at best matronly".&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;

Lucien Agosta argued that the piece illustrates a theme in Rossetti's work of Art as independent of, and triumphant over, [[Nature]]. He noted that Rossetti, in a letter, had written that the subject's song was a "magic lay" and that the sonnet describes unnatural "netherland gulf-whispers", and that the siren's attraction of a bird to listen to her song inverts the relationship of ''[[Veronica Veronese]]'', in which the musician is inspired by a bird.&lt;ref name="Agosta"/&gt;

==History==
The painting was owned by Leyland, who may have acquired it from Rossetti, and sold through [[Christie's]] in 1892. It was owned by [[T. F. Wigley]], David Croal Thomson, and [[William Lever, 2nd Viscount Leverhulme|William Hulme, Viscount Leverhulme]], who sold it in 1926 through Anderson Galleries of [[New York City|New York]]. Anderson Galleries sold it to another New York dealer, Scott &amp; Fowles, from whom lawyer and art collector [[Grenville Lindall Winthrop|Grenville L. Winthrop]] purchased it in 1935. Winthrop donated the work to the [[Fogg Art Museum]] of his ''[[alma mater]]'', [[Harvard University]], in 1939.&lt;ref name="HAM"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harvard Art Museums curatorial staff|title=From the Harvard Art Museums' collections: A Sea-Spell|url=http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/art/230614|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Sea–Spell'' was exhibited in a posthumous Rossetti show at the [[Burlington Fine Arts Club]] of [[London]] in 1883; in the [[Art Gallery of South Australia|National Gallery of South Australia]], on loan from Wigley, in 1899;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article166447716 |title=Fair and Unfair |newspaper=[[Quiz And The Lantern]] |volume=X, |issue=501 |location=South Australia |date=27 April 1899 |accessdate=16 June 2018 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a Rossetti-centered exhibition at the [[Spencer Museum of Art|University of Kansas Museum of Art]] in 1958; at the [[National Museum of Western Art]] of [[Tokyo]] in 2002; and as part of many Fogg Art Museum and Harvard Art Museums exhibitions. It is currently on display on the second floor of the Harvard Art Museums.&lt;ref name="HAM" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8845">The '''Bay Area Reference Center''' (BARC) was a [[Reference librarian|reference]] service serving nine [[Northern California]] [[public library]] systems and headquartered at the [[San Francisco Public Library]]. It was established as an experiment in 1967 by the [[California State Library]] and closed down in 1988, when the funding from the US Federal Government that it relied on was ended. It pioneered the use of networking technologies such as [[teletype]] and [[fax machine]]s in providing reference services to patrons at far-flung, sometimes rural libraries. Its magazine, ''Synergy'', won two [[American Library Association|ALA]] awards.

==Background==
Studies of public library services in California had shown that large parts of the state, particularly rural areas, were underserved.&lt;ref name=Wiley176&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter Booth |last=Wiley |title=A Free Library in this City: The Illustrated History of the San Francisco Public Library |location=San Francisco |publisher=Weldon Owen |year=1996 |isbn=9781875137053 |page=176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, a 1962 master plan called for the establishment of four levels of library services: local libraries, regional reference centers, tertiary reference centers covering larger regions, and as the fourth and final level, the State Library in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. The Bay Area Reference Center was established in August 1967 as a tertiary center, or "source of last resort",&lt;ref name=Wiley176/&gt; as a collaboration between the San Francisco Public Library and the North Bay Cooperative Library System (NBCLS), a consortium of nine public library systems including 17 libraries in six counties north of San Francisco, with its headquarters in [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]]. It was made possible by a federal grant under the 1964 [[Library Services and Construction Act]]; the initial grant was $750,735 for a two-year pilot project.&lt;ref name=Synergy&gt;{{cite journal |first=Richard |last=Coenenberg |title=SYNERGIZING Reference Service in the San Francisco Bay Region |journal=ALA Bulletin |volume=62 |issue=11 |date=December 1968 |pages=1379–84 |jstor=25698028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A corresponding service was set up for Southern California, the [[Southern California Answering Network]] (SCAN).&lt;ref name=Dustin&gt;{{cite book |first=M.

==Services==
Patron questions that could not be answered locally were referred first to one of three secondary reference centers within the system, located at the [[Vallejo Public Library]], the [[Ukiah-Mendocino County Library]], and the [[Santa Rosa-Sonoma County Public Library]]. If still unanswerable, they were sent on via a six-day-a-week teletype link to BARC at the [[San Francisco Main Library]]. Five NBCLS libraries, the San Francisco Main Library and two San Francisco branches, including the downtown business branch, also had fax machines that were sometimes used for delivering information to patrons. BARC had its own director, assistant director, clerical workers, and eight subject specialists, and acquired specialist reference materials to supplement those already available in the San Francisco library system. The staff also researched some questions in person and by phone and fax,&lt;ref name=Synergy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Celeste |last=West |authorlink=Celeste West |contribution=Introduction: ''Revolting Librarians'' Rides Again'' |editor1-first=Toni |editor1-last=Samek |editor2-first=K.

BARC staff conducted biweekly workshops for reference librarians and published bibliographies on topics including the Chinese in California and the San Francisco Public Library's collection on theatrical costumes.&lt;ref name=Synergy/&gt;

===Journals===
Beginning in 1967 BARC published a bibliographic magazine called ''Synergy''. This included controversial topics of the day, such as "the New Left, the New Right, the underground press, feminism, and gay liberation."&lt;ref name=Wiley178/&gt; It twice won the ALA's H. W. Wilson Library Periodical Award,&lt;ref name=Wiley178/&gt;&lt;ref name=protest&gt;{{cite journal |first=Edward |last=Swanson | title=Synergy Protest |journal=American Libraries |volume=4 |issue=7 |date=July–August 1973 |page=408 |type=Letter |jstor=25619256 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was so popular its circulation was capped for cost reasons after reaching 2,000, but after its second editor, [[Celeste West]], published an unflattering photograph of [[Richard Nixon]] in 1973, its funding was withdrawn by the state librarian, [[Ethel Crockett]].&lt;ref name=Wiley178/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Swanson, president of the Minnesota Library Association, published a protest resolution in the ALA journal,&lt;ref name=protest/&gt; and West's reprimand for unprofessional behavior was withdrawn, but ''Synergy'' was replaced by ''BARC Notes''.&lt;ref name=Wiley178/&gt;

==Closure==
BARC closed down after the federal funding on which it depended was ended in 1988.&lt;ref name=Wiley178/&gt;

==Effectiveness==
When it closed, BARC served a region populated by 12&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref name=Wiley178/&gt; In 1978, one analyst saw potential in such pooling of resources to serve a region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thomas |last=Childers |title=The Future of Reference and Information Service in the Public Library |journal=The Library Quarterly |volume=48 |issue=4: ''Proceedings of the Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference of the Graduate Library School, April 10-11, 1978. The Public Library: Circumstance and Prospects'' |date=October 1978 |jstor=4307020 |page=465 }}&lt;!-- NOT [[Thomas Childers]] --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, a comparison of responses to the same genuine patron queries by BARC, the second-level reference center in [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], and a for-profit reference service, Information on Demand, showed that BARC's answers were usually better than the Fresno center's as a result of the depth of its resources, but that none of the three answered all the test questions correctly and quickly.&lt;ref name=Crowley/&gt; The tertiary reference centers were expensive: in 1986 BARC and its Southern Californian counterpart, SCAN, estimated the cost of answering each query at $150, and the California State Library launched a study of costs of the two centers.&lt;ref name=Dustin/&gt;

==People==
Richard Coenenberg was the first director of BARC. Assistant Director Gil MacNamee later became director. In addition to West, Peggy Barber, later an ALA staff member, was one of the librarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Excellence in Action: 1999 ALA Award Winners |journal=American Libraries |volume=30 |issue=8 |date=September 1999 |page=80 |jstor=25637296 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:BlockedLaceScarf.JPG|thumb|knitted scarf during blocking]]
In [[knitting]], [[crochet]] and other [[textile arts]], '''blocking''' is a final stage of handmade textile production that adjusts the shape of the finished piece. Not all pieces need blocking; however, blocking is standard for [[lace]] work and is not uncommon in sweaters, socks, and other solid projects. Through [[heat]] and [[moisture]], blocking sets the [[stitch (textile arts)|stitch]]es and standardizes the final dimensions, and may enhance the drape.&lt;ref&gt;Edie Eckman, ''The Crochet Answer Book'', North Adams, Massachusetts: Storey Publishing, 2005, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hand manufacture places natural stresses on fabrics that may result in deviations from its intended shape and size.  Blocking is only effective on natural fibres&lt;ref&gt;Debbie Stoller, ''Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker'' New York: Workman Publishing, 2006, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; but a technique called [[#.22Killing.22|"killing"]] may be used on synthetic fibres to achieve an effect similar to blocking.

The degree of malleability is determined by the type of [[yarn]] used, with [[wool]] providing the most flexibility.  For projects that are produced in sections, blocking is normally done prior to final assembly.

==Blocking methods==

[[File:Lace knitting 2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Unblocked lace stole still on the needles. This item will expand significantly after pinning and blocking.]]Blocking can be done in several different ways.  Depending on the method, the crafter may use rustproof [[pin]]s, blocking wires, a steamer, or a [[steam iron]].  A stable flat surface and [[towel]]s are standard.  Fibres that tolerate water well may be wet blocked, shaping moist fabric into the desired shape and then allowing it to air dry.  Cold blocking uses no heat and less water to achieve the same result by spraying water upon the material instead of immersing the fabric.  Steam blocking uses a steamer or steam iron, but without applying direct pressure to the item.&lt;ref&gt;Eckman, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wet blocking ===

Wet blocking is done by saturating a garment in warm water and allowing it to dry. Some items (especially lace) are stretched while wet with the use of pins and/or blocking wires, while others may be gently shaped without stretching.

=== Steam blocking ===

Steam blocking is done by hovering a hot, steaming iron over the fabric. Hovering the iron about 1 or 2 inches above the fabric flattens the stitch, makes it thinner, and allows it to hold its shape better.  This is the only method that works for blocking synthetics, like acrylic.

=== Spritz blocking ===

Spritz blocking involves spraying the garment with water. This relaxes the fibres more than steam blocking but less than wet blocking. Most often, a spray bottle is used.

=== "Killing" ===
It is possible to "set" synthetic fibres through a process known as "killing", wherein the item is pinned in place and carefully steamed to achieve a very slight controlled melt of the fibres. "Killed" fabrics are permanently set and cannot be returned to their original form through washing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2485">[[Image:broeltorens.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Broel Towers and the [[Leie|Lys river]]]]

The '''Broel Towers''' ({{lang-nl|Broeltorens}}) are a classified monument and a [[landmark]] in the Belgian city of [[Kortrijk]]. The towers are known as one of the most important symbols of the city.

== History ==
Although they look identical, the towers were not built at the same time. The Southern tower, also known as the ''Speyetoren'', was built in 1385 to control the traffic on the [[river Lys]]. This tower was part of the fortified fence of the first [[medieval]] castle of the [[Counts of Flanders]]. The Speyentoren was also part of the 12th century rampart, destroyed by Louis XIV in the 17th century. &lt;br&gt;
The Northern tower, known as the ''Ingelborchtoren'' was built in 1415 and was used as an [[Armory (military)|armory]].

Nowadays, the towers are, together with the Artillerytower (''in Dutch: Artillerietoren''), the last remaining parts of the [[medieval]] [[city wall]] around the city. Most of the fortifications in Kortrijk were ordered to be destroyed by [[Vauban]] in 1683, a period in which the French and the Spanish armies repeatedly fought over control of the region. The remaining parts were destroyed in the 18th century and during the world wars.

A statue of [[John of Nepomuk]] can be found in the middle of the bridge spanning between the two towers. This statue of the patron saint of the drowned has, ironically, fallen into the river Lys on several occasions due to warfare in the city. The bridge between the two towers was destroyed in both world wars.

'''Celtic inscribed stones''' are stone monuments dating from 400 to 1000 AD. They are inscribed with [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] or [[Latin]] text, which can be written in [[Ogham inscription|Ogham]] or [[Latin script|Roman]] letters. Some stones have both Ogham and Roman inscriptions. The stones are found in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], [[Brittany]], the [[Isle of Man]], and parts of western [[England]] (mainly [[Cornwall]], [[Devon]], and [[Lundy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/cisp/database/ |title=Celtic Inscribed Stones Project history |accessdate=2008-01-08 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They relate to other standing stones with decoration, such as the [[Turoe Stone]] and [[Castlestrange Stone]].

'''Damian Le Bas''' (30 January 1963, [[Sheffield]] – 9 December 2017, [[Worthing]]) was a British artist associated with the [[Outsider art|Outsider Art]] (or "Art Brut") label, as well a leading exponent of the "Roma Revolution" in art. 

==Life==
Le Bas was of [[Irish traveller|Irish Traveller]] heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/high-profile-stories-of-children-expose-europes-anti-roma-prejudice/article15200641/|title=High-profile stories of children expose Europe’s anti-Roma prejudice|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2017|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; Le Bas attended the [[Royal College of Art]].&lt;ref name="SS_Ob"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/oct/29/life1.lifemagazine4|title=Outsider dealing|last=Steward|first=Sue|date=29 October 2000|work=The Observer|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived and worked with his wife, the [[Romani people|Romany]] artist [[Delaine Le Bas]],&lt;ref name="SS_Ob" /&gt; in [[West Sussex]] on the south coast. He was the father of writer [[Damian_Le_Bas_(writer)|Damian Le Bas]].

== Collections ==
Since 1987 several of Le Bas' pieces are held in the Musgrave-Kinley Collection of works by key Outsider artists, administered by [[Monika Kinley]], until her death in 2014.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/apr/06/monika-kinley|title=Monika Kinley obituary|last=Dempsey|first=Andrew|date=6 April 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/damian-le-bas-britischer-kuenstler-ueberraschend-gestorben-a-1182758.html|title=Britischer Künstler: Damian Le Bas ist tot|date=11 December 2017|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2017|via=Spiegel Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; His more recent work is found, among others, in the collections of Perpetuum Mobile.

==Exhibitions==

{{nihongo|'''''Death by Hanging'''''|絞死刑|Kōshikei}} is a 1968 Japanese film directed by [[Nagisa Oshima]], starring Do-yun Yu. It was acclaimed for its innovative [[Brechtian]] techniques and complex treatments of guilt and consciousness, justice, and the persecution of ethnic [[Koreans in Japan]].

== Plot ==
A documentary-like opening introduces a death chamber where an execution is about to take place. Inexplicably, the man to be executed, an ethnic Korean known only as R, survives hanging but loses his memory. The officials who witness the hanging debate how to proceed, as the law could be interpreted as forbidding execution of an individual who does not recognize their crime and its punishment.  
They decide that they must persuade R to accept guilt by reminding him of his crimes{{snd}} at this point the film moves into a highly theatricalized film-within-a-film structure.

In scenes of absurd and perverse humor, the officials recreate R's first crime, the rape of a young woman.  This failing, they attempt to recreate his childhood by way of performing crude racist stereotypes of Koreans held by some Japanese. Exasperated, they resort to visiting the scene of R's other crime at an abandoned high school, but in an overzealous moment of reenactment, an official murders a girl. Back in the death chamber, a woman claiming to be R's "sister" appears one by one to the officials.  She tries to convince R that his crimes are justified by Korean nationalism against a Japanese enemy, but after failing to win him over, is herself hanged. At a drinking party to celebrate her hanging, the officials reveal their guilt-ridden, violent pasts, oblivious to R and his "sister" lying on the floor amongst them, themselves exploring R's psyche. The prosecutor invites R to leave a free man, but when he opens the door, he is driven back by an intense burst of light from outside, symbolizing the fact that as a Korean he will never be accepted by Japanese society. Finally, R admits to the crimes, but proclaims himself innocent{{snd}} stating that if the officers execute him, then they are murderers as well. In his second hanging, R's body disappears, leaving an empty noose hanging beneath the gallows.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Ian. "Nagisa Oshima." In Second Wave England: November Books, 1970. pp. 70–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The character R in ''Death by Hanging'' was based on [[Ri Chin'u]], an ethnic Korean who in 1958 murdered two Japanese school girls.  A precocious, talented young man, he not only confessed to his crimes, but wrote about them in great detail; his writings, collected as ''Crime, Death, and Love'' became nearly as famous as his crimes and persona.  Much of his book consisted of correspondence with [[Bok Junan]], a Korean journalist sympathetic to the [[communist]] North.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turim|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "sister" character was developed from this relationship, indicating the journalist's Korean nationalist interpretation of Ri's life and experiences.  Much of R and the "sister's" dialogue is taken from this correspondence.  Oshima held Ri Chin'u in high regard, despite his crimes.  Claiming him to be "the most intelligent and sensitive youth produced by postwar Japan", Oshima thought his prose "ought to be included in high school textbooks".  Oshima first wrote a script about him in 1963, but this was not the version that eventually was filmed.&lt;ref&gt;Oshima, Nagisa. "About Death By Hanging". pp. 166–169 in Cinema, Censorship, and the State: The Writings of Nagisa Oshima, 1956-1978, ed. Annette Michelson. Cambridge: The MIT Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to 1968, the idea was conceptually reworked, with Ri Chin'u negated as hero and replaced by R, a Korean subject more open to experimental treatment and analysis.  The resulting film is just as much concerned with the domestic repression of Koreans in Japan as with the death penalty, but remains cinematically important because of its theoretical and conceptual innovations.&lt;ref name="Turim1998"/&gt;

==Themes==
===Guilt and consciousness===
For all its dark absurdity, ''Death by Hanging'' addresses a number of themes{{snd}} guilt and consciousness, and also race and discrimination (all within a greater context of state violence){{snd}} with great gravity. The guiding juxtaposition is of the criminal consciousness with the state's license to commit violence without guilt.  If the state has internalized in its formation communal norms of "guilt" and "justice", thereby wielding violence legitimately (even if{{snd}} in this case{{snd}} wrapped in a context of ethnic bigotry), it must still prove guilt to transgressors, in this case, the character R.  Guilt is culturally learned, but R presents the difficulty of not being aware of guilt or acknowledgement of violating social boundaries in his crimes; he likewise remains unaware of his own ethnicity and cannot comprehend the link (as it is presented to him) between his ethnicity and his alleged criminality. Both the assorted officials (legal, scientific, and metaphysic representatives) and his "sister" (representative of nationalism) attempt, but fail to recreate R's consciousness. In fact, their own violent actions (simulated rape, murder, recollection of war crimes) and ignorance accentuate the contradiction of violence and guilt{{snd}} the state that has been sanctioned to kill is constituted by people just as guilty and worthy of punishment as R, the criminal. The implications extend far beyond a mere commentary on the [[death penalty]], but pose an open-ended series of questions about the relationship between the individual and the state, between violence and guilt (or an understood concept of guilt), and between ethnic discrimination and the various products of discrimination:  as Koreans were discriminated against and denied legitimacy by Japan, so R denies Japanese state authority. His body's refusal to die becomes an act of resistance against the state and its delineation of justified and unjustified violence.&lt;ref&gt;Standish, Isolde. A New History of Japanese Cinema New York: Continuum, 2005. pp. 244–250.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation resonates with Oshima's long-standing concern with the plight of the Korean minority, and with the painful history of the Japanese occupation of Korea and war-time atrocities.

===A Brechtian theater of the absurd===
Despite its documentary style, from the start, as voiceover and image give contradictory information, it is clear that ''Death by Hanging'' is not a presentation of "reality". This distancing is compounded by the seven intertitles that give an indication of the action about to occur (or in a psychoanalytic interpretation, displacing R as a defined subject). These techniques have established the film as Oshima's most [[Brechtian]]. Other ideas borrowed from [[Brecht]] include dark humor, the theme of justice, and an exploration of open-ended, unresolved contradictions. That a death chamber serves as this unlikely theater of the absurd underscores the film's dominant ironic tone. Rich in symbolism and visual allusions, Oshima's ''[[mise en scène]]'' contains a number of subtle, masterful touches, such as the newspapered walls in the reconstruction of R's youth referencing the intense media scrutiny of Ri Chin'u. Another theatrical element observed by Maureen Turim is the important role of dialogue: "much of the humor and irony is a matter of verbal repartee, presented in exquisite timing and visual framing."&lt;ref name="Turim1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Turim|1998|pages=61–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''Death by Hanging'' was released theatrically in Japan on March 9, 1968, where it was distributed by [[Toho]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=247}} This was the first Toho release in [[Vista Vision]] size format.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=247}} The film was released in the United States theatrically by [[New Yorker Films]] with English subtitles on December 8, 1971.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=247}}

== Reception ==
In Japan, the film won the ''[[Kinema Junpo]]'' Award for Best Screenplay.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=247}}

[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' found the film provocative and entertaining while it focused on capital punishment, but felt it reached a point of total confusion as it became more [[Godardian]] or Brechtian. He also called Oshima's directing "hugely concerned and committed to the sort of cinema that plays an active role in its society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Canby|first1=Vincent|title=Death By Hanging (1968)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A01E2D8133FEF34BC4D52DFB466838F669EDE|website=The New York Times|date=February 15, 1974|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Richie]] of the ''[[Japan Times]]'' felt that halfway through the film, when R's sister appears, the film's statement is "clear, direct, double-edged, and brilliantly delivered", but afterward it "unravels, getting more and more woolly-headed while the words come thicker and longer and faster". However, he still felt that at the end, the film raised important questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richie|first1=Donald|title=Donald Richie on 'Koshikei (Death by Hanging)'|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2013/01/17/films/film-reviews/donald-richie-on-koshikei-death-by-hanging/|website=The Japan Times|date=January 28, 1968|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital Blasphemy''' is a commercial website for [[computer wallpaper]]s designed and created by independent [[Computer-generated imagery]] artist Ryan Bliss, an English and [[Computer Science]] graduate from the [[University of Iowa]]. The name Digital Blasphemy was chosen because of the "Godlike" feeling Bliss experienced when creating worlds through artwork.&lt;ref name="name"&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://digitalblasphemy.com/faq.shtml#name|title= Digital Blasphemy FAQ | publisher= [[Ryan Bliss]] |accessdate= 2011-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is subscription-based, but a free gallery is available to non-members.  Images in the free gallery are rotated regularly with fresh images,&lt;ref name="removed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalblasphemy.com/faq.shtml#removed|title= Digital Blasphemy FAQ | publisher= [[Ryan Bliss]] |accessdate= 2011-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are presented in various [[Display resolution|screen resolutions]].&lt;ref name="resolutions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalblasphemy.com/faq.shtml#resolutions|title= Digital Blasphemy FAQ|publisher= [[Ryan Bliss]] |accessdate= 2011-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the free gallery provides multi-monitor samples and mobile device images for Android devices, as well as [[BlackBerry]], [[iPhone]], and [[Palm OS|Palm]].  The member gallery includes all available artwork numbering over 820, not including image alternate forms.&lt;ref name="membership"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secure.digitalblasphemy.com/signup.shtml|title= Digital Blasphemy Membership|publisher= [[Ryan Bliss]] |accessdate= 2014-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some images have additional forms and are in a section known as the "Picklejar". This provides, variously, the same images in different colors or presentations, or similar images with removed, added, or changed content or elements. At times, the original image ends up in the Picklejar section and the updated and improved image takes its place in the main gallery.&lt;ref name="picklejar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalblasphemy.com/pj/|title=Digital Blasphemy PickleJar|publisher= [[Ryan Bliss]] |accessdate= 2011-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A way to browse Pickle Jar images was added in June 2014.&lt;ref name="Picklejar List"&gt;http://digitalblasphemy.com/picklejar.shtml?i=pickles&amp;mode=list&lt;/ref&gt;

==Designs==
Typical designs include science fiction and fantasy, space imagery, planetscapes, landscapes, cityscapes, seascapes, underwater scenes, interiors, abstracts, fractals. There are also images depicting seasons and seasonal events, special occasions, and holidays such as Halloween, Christmas, the Fourth of July, Saint Patrick's Day, and Valentine's Day.

Wallpapers come in many display resolutions up to 7680 x 1600, including widescreen and [[multi-monitor]] formats to accommodate various monitor configurations. Only subscribers have access to the highest resolution wallpapers.  As of July 2007, many wallpapers were converted to display on mobile devices such as cell phones and tablets, and the first [[1080p]] animated wallpaper was created.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalblasphemy.com/dbhome.shtml Digital Blasphemy 3d Wallpaper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the paintings attributed to '''Giovanni da Rimini''' (''[[Floruit|fl]]''. 1292–1336) are two [[Panel painting|panels]] from a former '''[[diptych]]''', dated to 1300–1305, of which the left wing is in the collection of the [[National Gallery]], London, and the right that of the [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica]], [[Palazzo Barberini]], Rome.&lt;ref name="NG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barberini"/&gt;

==Giovanni da Rimini==
Giovanni, ''pictor'' (painter), later ''maestro'' (master), is known from legal documents to have lived in [[Rimini]] between 1292 and 1336. This Giovanni is thought to be the same as the artist of the inscribed [[crucifix]] ([[:it:Crocifisso di Mercatello sul Metauro|it]]) in San Francesco ([[:it:Museo di San Francesco|it]]), [[Mercatello sul Metauro]], inscribed IOH(ann)ES PICTOR FECIT HOC OPUS / FR(atri) TOBALDI, attesting to its creation by Giovanni the Painter, and dated 1309.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museodelmetauro.it/?q=it/node/17 |title=Crocifisso Giovanni da Rimini |trans-title=Crucifix by Giovanni da Rimini |publisher=[[:it:Museo di San Francesco|Museo del Metauro]] |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OUP"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FtlMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA7 |title=The Grove Encyclopedia of Medieval Art and Architecture, Volume 2 |editor=Hourihane, Colum |year=2012 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |pages=7–8 |isbn=978-0195395365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three or four other crucifixes are identified as being by the same artist, influenced by that ([[:it:Crocifisso di Rimini|it]]) of [[Giotto]]: the "Diotallevi” Crucifix ([[:it:Crocifisso (Giovanni da Rimini)|it]]), in the Museo della città, Rimini ([[:it:Museo della città di Rimini|it]]);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museicomunalirimini.it/musei/museo_citta/patrimonio_museo_citta/catalogo_mappa_museo_citta/-medievale_moderno_piano1/pagina18.html |title=La Scuola riminese e i dipinti del XIV secolo |trans-title=The Rimini School and paintings of the fourteenth century |language=Italian |publisher=[[Rimini|Comune di Rimini]] |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; another in San Lorenzo, [[Talamello]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comune.talamello.rn.it/index.php?id=14263 |title=Il Crocefisso di Giovanni da Rimini (1300) |trans-title=Crucifix by Giovanni da Rimini (1300) |language=Italian |publisher=[[Talamello|Comune di Talamello]] |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; another in San Francesco, [[Sassoferrato]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://catalogo.fondazionezeri.unibo.it/scheda.jsp?decorator=layout_S2&amp;apply=true&amp;tipo_scheda=OA&amp;id=7629 |title=Giovanni da Rimini, Cristo crocifisso |trans-title=Christ on the Cross, by Giovanni da Rimini |language=Italian |publisher=[[Federico Zeri|Fondazione Federico Zeri]], [[University of Bologna]] |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a fourth sold at [[Sotheby's]] in 2015.&lt;ref name="OUP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2015/so-moretti-n09306/lot.131.html |title=Giovanni da Rimini: Painted Crucifix |publisher=[[Sotheby's]] |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giovanni's panel paintings include what is probably half of a second diptych, ''The Virgin and Child with Five Saints'', in the Pinacoteca Comunale di Faenza ([[:it:Pinacoteca comunale di Faenza|it]]).&lt;ref name="OUP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pinacotecafaenza.racine.ra.it/ita/opere/op_626.htm |title=Giovanni da Rimini, Madonna col Bambino, due Angeli e i SS.

==''Scenes from the Lives of the Virgin and other Saints''==
The diptych's left wing, [[Provenance|once owned]] by the [[Barberini family]], and subsequently by Pietro and [[Vincenzo Camuccini]], was acquired as being by Giotto by [[Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland]] in 1853, for £100. At [[Alnwick Castle]] thereafter, the painting passed by descent to the [[Ralph Percy, 12th Duke of Northumberland|12th Duke of Northumberland]], before being sold at [[Sotheby's]] in 2014 for £5.7 million, including [[buyer's premium]].&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sotheby's"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2014/old-master-british-paintings-evening-l14033/lot.17.html |title=Giovanni da Rimini: Left wing of a diptych with episodes from the lives of the Virgin and other saints |publisher=[[Sotheby's]] |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art|temporary export bar]] was placed on the painting, on the grounds of it meeting "[[Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art#Waverley Criteria|Waverley Criteria]]" 2 and 3, being of "outstanding aesthetic [[Values (heritage)|value]]" and in excellent condition, and of "outstanding significance for the study of [[Trecento]] painting in Rimini".&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/last-chance-to-keep-rare-14th-century-italian-painting-in-the-uk |title=Last chance to keep rare 14th century Italian painting in the UK |publisher=[[Gov.uk]] |date=29 October 2014 |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the financial assistance of [[Ronald Lauder]], son of [[Estée Lauder (businesswoman)|Estée Lauder]], the painting was acquired by the [[National Gallery]] in 2015, under an agreement that would see it loaned back to the benefactor for the remainder of his lifetime, with triennial displays at the Gallery, the first in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/about-us/press-and-media/saved-for-the-nation |title=Saved for the nation |date=July 2015 |publisher=[[National Gallery]] |accessdate=4 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905202126/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/about-us/press-and-media/saved-for-the-nation |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/28/rare-painting-secured-for-uk-in-unique-deal-with-cosmetics-heir |title=Rare painting secured for UK in unique deal with cosmetics heir |author=Mark Brown |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=28 July 2015 |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "jewel-like"&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt; painting, showing the influence of [[Byzantine art]] and of [[Giotto]], comprises four scenes in an unusual [[iconographic]] combination that likely reflects the donor's wishes.&lt;ref name="NG"/&gt; Of the four scenes, the top two are of a double height, the bottom two separated by the edge of the throne in place of a decorative band. They depict, from left to right, top to bottom, the [[Apotheosis#Christianity|Apotheosis]] of [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], above a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] temple standing over the saint's empty tomb, the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], above a crowd of onlooking saints and angels, [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]] disputing with the philosophers before Emperor [[Maxentius]], and a pairing of the episodes of [[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis]] receiving the [[stigmata]] and [[John the Baptist|Saint John the Baptist]] in the wilderness, proclaiming the coming of the [[Messiah#Christianity|Messiah]], with a winged [[cherub]] in-between.&lt;ref name="NG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt; John the Baptist's scroll reads ECCE / [[Agnus Dei (liturgy)|AGN(us) / DEI]] / ECCE / Q(u)I TO(l) / LIT (peccata mundi) ''Behold the Lambe of God, which taketh away the sinne of the world'' ([[Gospel of John|John]] 1.29, [[KJV]]).

==''Scenes from the Life of Christ''==
The right wing of the diptych formed part of the Sciarra Collection until 1897 and is now in the [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica]], [[Palazzo Barberini]], Rome. Separated by decorative bands, the six zones of equal size depict, from left to right, top to bottom, the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]], with Christ's first bath in the foreground, the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]], the [[Burial of Jesus|Entombment]], the [[Harrowing of Hell|Descent into Limbo]], the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]], with the [[The Three Marys#The three Marys at the tomb|Three Marys at the Tomb]], and the [[Last Judgment]].&lt;ref name="Barberini"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt;

The '''''Feast of Herod with the Beheading of St John the Baptist''''' is an extremely large painting by the  German-[[Silesia]]n artist [[Bartholomeus Strobel]] the Younger (1591 &amp;ndash; about 1650) which is now displayed in the [[Museo del Prado]] in [[Madrid]].  In oils on canvas, it measures 2.80 x 9.52 metres, and is variously dated between about 1630 and 1643.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, 409; Harosimowicz; variant titles include:  "The Beheading of St John the Baptist", "Herod's Feast" (see Fresco), "The Banquet of Herod and the Decapitation of John the Baptist" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=I2tCAjijsKQC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90] etc. The Prado's Spanish title is ''' ''La Degollación de San Juan Bautista y el banquete de Herodes''''' and their English one (in the Prado Guide) is '''''The Beheading of St John the Baptist and the Banquet of Herod'''''&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting shows two scenes from the biblical account of the death of [[John the Baptist]].  The main part of the painting, on the left, shows the banquet of [[Herod Antipas]] at which his daughter [[Salome]] produced the head of John the Baptist.  The much smaller execution scene is shown on the right hand side, to the right of the column dividing the picture space.&lt;ref&gt;Ossowski, 13&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Beheading of John the Baptist]] had often been  combined with the [[Feast of Herod (disambiguation)|Feast of Herod]] in this way, with the execution relegated to a different space at the side of the image, a pattern Strobel takes to an extreme.

The figures include many portraits of leading figures of the [[Thirty Years' War]], and probably other less well known court figures, not all so far identified, or with agreed identifications.  It has been interpreted as an [[allegory|allegorical]] "appeal to the Christian world to save [Strobel's] doomed home country" of Silesia, which had suffered greatly from the wars.&lt;ref name="Harosimowicz"&gt;Harosimowicz&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Strobel-bautista.jpg|thumb|850px|''Feast of Herod with the Beheading of St John the Baptist'', [[Prado]], almost 10 metres wide, this enormous work is probably the masterpiece of Bartholomeus Strobel the Younger]]

==Allegory of Europe==
[[File:Strobel-bautista crop left.jpg|left|thumb|The military group at the left]]
The painting includes many portraits of leading political and military figures from around Europe, relying on prints for the likenesses of those not known to Strobel. It is probably central to the allegory that the coat of arms of Strobel's home city, now [[Wrocław]], Poland, which he would have known by its German name of Breslau, includes the image of the head of John the Baptist on a platter. Strobel was forced to leave Breslau by the Thirty Years' War in 1634, finally settling in Poland. Only Herod himself, dressed in oriental costume, reacts strongly to the head produced at the dining table; the other figures seem unconcerned, which may be the point of the allegory.&lt;ref&gt;Harosimowicz; Ossowski, 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

Identifications of the figures shown vary.&lt;ref&gt;Ossowski, 14–15; he avoids endorsing any identifications&lt;/ref&gt; One set, predicated on a date in the early 1640s for the work, is as follows: the figure holding a trumpet at the centre, looking out at the viewer, is the Dutch [[Admiral Tromp]], whose victory at the [[Battle of the Downs]] in 1639 had decisively ended Spanish naval power. To his left [[Henry IV of France]] (who had died in 1610) pulls at a cloth over a table laid with fruit (so presenting "the fruits of victory").  The group of men standing in the foreground on the left are the Imperial generalissimo [[Albrecht von Wallenstein|Wallenstein]], with the long staff, with behind him his subordinate generals Count [[Vilém Kinský]], Christian Freiherr von Ilow and Count Adam Erdmann Trcka von Lipa as well as one of their assassins in 1634, the Irish colonel of [[dragoon]]s [[Walter Butler of Roscrea]].&lt;ref name="Harosimowicz" /&gt;

Among the diners at the table are [[John George I, Elector of Saxony]], [[Charles I of England]], the [[Infanta]] and from 1637 Empress [[Maria Anna of Spain]] (wife of [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor]]), [[Marie de' Medici]], [[Dowager]] Queen of France, her favourite [[Concino Concini]] (d. 1617), [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]] ([[favourite]] of Charles I until assassinated in 1637), and [[Marie de Rohan]], duchesse de Chevreuse.&lt;ref name="Harosimowicz" /&gt;
[[File:Strobel-bautista crop ladies.jpg|thumb|Herod and the group of ladies]]

The head of John the Baptist on the platter has the features of Duke [[John Christian of Brieg]] (d. 1639), the staunch [[Calvinist]] champion of Silesian Protestantism.  Salome holds the plate, and since her elaborate dress still leaves her implausibly high breasts completely uncovered, she is unlikely to be a portrait of an important figure.&lt;ref name="Harosimowicz" /&gt;

To the right of Herod, the group of ladies includes: [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia]], Queen [[Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg]], widow of [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] (died 1632), with her daughter [[Christina, Queen of Sweden]] (only born in 1626) and sister [[Catherine of Brandenburg]], briefly ruler of [[Transylvania]] after her husband [[Gabriel Bethlen]], King of Hungary, died in 1629.  The boy with the torch in the foreground may be the exiled [[Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine]] (born 1617, son of Elizabeth Stuart), who inherited in 1632, and the somewhat lion-like dog in a sitting-up posture may be an illusion to the lions in the arms of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] as well as those of the [[Dutch Republic]].  The lady in the large turban in the row behind may be [[Amalia of Solms-Braunfels]], wife of [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange]], the Dutch [[stadtholder]], who gave the Palatine family refuge in exile.&lt;ref name="Harosimowicz" /&gt;

Alternative identifications find a portrait of [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor]], and identify the features of John the Baptist as those of Charles I of England, although he was not beheaded until 1649, which is probably well after Strobel painted the work.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Catalogo, 377&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
[[File:Strobel-bautista crop table.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the left end of the table. The depiction of the standing figures at front varies, and the two boys wear Polish styles of costume.]]
The style of the figures in the Prado painting varies between realistic portraiture, generalized and idealized faces, especially among the females, and expressive caricature, with the three types often mixed in a single group.  The costumes of many figures are painted in great detail and with precision, but the fashions shown vary from French styles of the 1630s to those of Poland, with some purely fanciful elements.  The two boys with candles in front of the left end of the table wear Polish styles, from the distinctive ''szkofia'' three-plumed hat badge of the right-hand one (held at his waist) to the boots of the one at left, who looks to be a portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Ossowski, 13–14, 17, 19; Prado Guide, 409&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wears a curved Polish or Hungarian type of ''[[szabla]]'' ([[sabre]]). Behind the two boys is a figure of uncertain gender wearing the modified Roman military uniform typically worn by goddesses and allegorical figures in Northern Mannerism; there is a similar figure at the front of the Munich ''Feast''.  

This mixture, both as to the depiction of faces and of clothing, is reminiscent of many northern religious paintings of the 15th and 16th centuries, especially those showing the [[Passion of Jesus]].  There are reminiscences of the fantastical style of the printmaker [[Jacques Bellange]], another artist whose homeland of Lorraine was to be ravaged by the war.  One critic finds the "blurred edges, eclecticism, mixed registers and parodic deflation of late Renaissance poetry are mirrored in [[Mannerist]] painting, from Jacques Bellange to Bartholomeus Strobel".&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Hoyt, ''The poetics of inconstancy: Etienne Durand and the end of Renaissance verse'', p. 221, 1998, University of North Carolina, {{ISBN|0807892602}}, 9780807892602&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite its late date, Strobel's work remains rooted in the Rudolfine [[Northern Mannerism]] of [[Prague]] which he had absorbed in his youth.&lt;ref&gt;Ossowski, 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The date of the painting and the circumstances of its commission remain unclear. To some extent these questions are tied to the identification of the portrait figures, in particular those of the boys or youths, as their appearances relate to a narrow time period. According to Harosimowicz, the source used for identifying the figures above, the painting "was probably created in Elbing under the patronage of Gerhard and Margaretha von Dönhoff in the period from 1640 to 1642". The [[Dönhoff]] family were wealthy German Protestant aristocrats in Silesia, who were also becoming integrated into the Polish nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Harosimowicz; for [[Gerhard Dönhoff]] (1590–1648), [[Pomerania during the Early Modern Age|Governor of Pomerania]] and administrator of [[Malbork|Marienburg]] for the Polish crown, see [[:pl:Gerard Denhoff (syn)]] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=68Y0pJRcTV4C&amp;pg=PA48 ''Schlesien in der Frühmoderne'', by Norbert Conrads].  He was the brother of [[Kasper Doenhoff]] and [[Ernst Magnus Dönhoff]], of a Baltic German family who had joined the Polish nobility.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1637 Dönhoff married Margaretha, the daughter of Duke John Christian of Brieg, whose features may be depicted on the head of John the Baptist.

Another suggestion for the patron (but with similar dating) is King [[Władysław IV Vasa]] of Poland (r. 1632–1649), who had appointed Strobel court artist in 1639.&lt;ref&gt;Jagiello&lt;/ref&gt;  The king's half-brother [[Karol Ferdynand Vasa]], [[Prince-Bishop of Wrocław]] (Breslau), whose court painter Strobel had previously been before he left Breslau in about 1633, has also been suggested, with an earlier dating to 1630–33, as used by the Prado (thus preceding Wallenstein's assassination).  Only the Prince-Bishop's coat of arms are shown in the painting, and it may have been at his palace at [[Nysa, Poland|Nysa]].&lt;ref&gt;Ossowski, 21; Prado biography; Prado Guide, 409&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bartholomaeus-strobel-dj-das-gastmahl-des-herodes-223579.jpg|thumb|The [[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Munich]] ''Feast of Herod'', now attributed to Strobel]]

By 1746 the painting was in the Spanish Royal Collection, belonging to [[Elisabeth Farnese]], Queen to [[Philip V of Spain]], and hung in "the room where their Majesties eat" in the [[Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso]], which Philip had built in the 1720s as a summer palace in the mountains near Madrid.  Philip had died that year, and his successor [[Ferdinand VI of Spain]] had granted the palace and its contents to his step-mother. In the year of her death in 1766 it was still inventoried at La Granja, but in 1794 and 1818 it was recorded at the newer [[Royal Palace of Aranjuez]].&lt;ref&gt;Prado page&lt;/ref&gt; Once in the Prado with the rest of the Spanish royal collection it was for long not on public display.  In the 2000s, with the remodelling around the construction of a new wing to the rear, gallery space was found for the painting, which now greets visitors who entered by the new wing as they emerge from the lifts on the main floor in the old building.&lt;ref&gt;The space (room 11b) is not numbered on the museum plan, but is between rooms 11 and 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was long vaguely attributed to an unknown Flemish artist, with suggestions that [[Joachim von Sandrart]], [[Hendrik Goltzius]] or [[Bartholomeus Spranger]] might be responsible, or an unknown artist from [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] or [[Augsburg]].  The first attribution to Strobel was made in 1970 by Jaromir Neumann, which was confirmed by Lode Seghers in 1987, on stylistic comparison with a ''David and [[Bathsheba]]'' signed by Strobel, now in Wallenstein's former castle at [[Mnichovo Hradiště]], [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Ossowski, 14–16; Prado Catalogo, 377; Fresco&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent comparisons with other documented works by Strobel have confirmed the attribution, which now seems generally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Ossowski, 16–19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Munich version==
On the basis of the Prado identification another ''Feast of Herod'' in the [[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Munich]], far smaller at 95 x 73&amp;nbsp;cm, was also attributed to Strobel, probably with an earlier date. This "extremely fascinating, involved and mysterious picture" shares many characteristics with the Prado's work, also containing portraits of political and military leaders, mixture of styles, and a complex picture space, with in this case the main feast in the upper background seen through columns.  It had previously been attributed to [[Jacques Bellange]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Alte Pinakotek, 523-524, 523 quoted; rather oddly Ossowski does not mention this work.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suggested subjects for portraits in the work include [[Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly]], who from 1610 until he died of his wounds in 1632 was the Imperial and [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic League]] field marshal before Wallenstein, and commander at the notorious [[Sack of Magdeburg]] in 1631.  He may be the figure to the left behind the balustrade.  The man reading to his right may also be a portrait.  The "richly attired man with a pointed beard" at the right hand side of the dining table above may be [[Gabor Bethlen]] (d 1629), the Calvinist [[Prince of Transylvania]] and Protestant claimant to be [[King of Hungary]], leader of the Hungarian anti-Habsburg forces in the war.  His widow [[Catherine of Brandenburg]] may be one of the ladies portrayed in the Prado version.&lt;ref&gt;Alte Pinakotek, 524&lt;/ref&gt;

Stroebel's ''Daniel and Cyrus before the Idol Bel'' (1636–1637) in the [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]], [[Warsaw]] is a similar composition, with the figures in eclectic and extravagant costumes, and a feast seen in progress at a lower level in the background.  It is still smaller at 39.5 × 30 cm (15.6 × 11.8 in), and in oil on copper.

'''Graffiti''' (both singular and plural; the singular ''graffito'' is very rare in English except in archeology)&lt;ref&gt; The Italian singular form "graffito" is so rare in English (except in specialist texts on archeology) that it is not even recorded or mentioned in some dictionaries, for example the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English and the Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oxd/&gt;&lt;ref name=ahd&gt;[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=graffiti American Heritage Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; is writing or drawings made on a wall or other surface, usually without permission and within public view.&lt;ref name=oxd/&gt;&lt;ref name=ahd/&gt; Graffiti ranges from simple written words to elaborate wall paintings, and it has existed [[Graffito (archaeology)|since ancient times]], with examples dating back to [[ancient Egypt]], [[ancient Greece]], and the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Graffito"/&gt;

In modern times, paint (particularly [[aerosol paint|spray paint]]) and [[marker pen]]s have become the most commonly used graffiti materials. In most countries, marking or painting property without the property owner's permission is considered defacement and [[vandalism]], which is a punishable crime.

Graffiti may also express underlying social and political messages and a whole genre of artistic expression is based upon spray paint graffiti styles. Within [[hip hop culture]], graffiti have evolved alongside [[hip hop music]], [[Breakdancing|b-boying]], and other elements.&lt;ref name=powder/&gt; Unrelated to hip-hop graffiti, gangs use their own form of graffiti to mark territory or to serve as an indicator of gang-related activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/get_informed/content_basic_view/23471|title=Why Gang Graffiti Is Dangerous - Los Angeles Police Department|website=www.lapdonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversies that surround graffiti continue to create disagreement amongst city officials, law enforcement, and writers who wish to display and appreciate work in public locations. There are many different types and styles of graffiti; it is a rapidly developing art form whose value is highly contested and reviled by many authorities while also subject to protection, sometimes within the same jurisdiction.

Both "graffiti" and its occasional singular form "graffito" are from the Italian word ''graffiato'' ("scratched"). "Graffiti" is applied in [[art history]] to works of art produced by scratching a design into a surface. A related term is "[[sgraffito]]",&lt;ref name=grant/&gt; which involves scratching through one layer of pigment to reveal another beneath it. This technique was primarily used by potters who would glaze their wares and then scratch a design into it. In ancient times graffiti were carved on walls with a sharp object, although sometimes [[chalk]] or [[coal]] were used. The word originates from Greek {{lang|el|γράφειν}}—''graphein''—meaning "to write".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/graffiti|title=graffiti {{!}} Origin and meaning of graffiti by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Graffitti, Castellania, Malta.jpeg|thumb|left|Figure graffito, similar to a relief, at the Castellania, in Valletta]] 
The term ''graffiti'' referred to the [[inscription]]s, figure drawings, and such, found on the walls of ancient [[sepulchre]]s or ruins, as in the [[Catacombs of Rome]] or at [[Pompeii]]. Use of the word has evolved to include any graphics applied to surfaces in a manner that constitutes [[vandalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Old Is Graffiti?|url=http://wonderopolis.org/wonder/how-old-is-graffiti/|website=Wonderopolis|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only known source of the [[Safaitic]] language, a form of proto-Arabic, is from graffiti: inscriptions scratched on to the surface of rocks and boulders in the predominantly basalt desert of southern [[Syria]], eastern [[Jordan]] and northern [[Saudi Arabia]]. Safaitic dates from the first century BC to the fourth century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://krc2.orient.ox.ac.uk/aalc/index.php/en/safaitic-database-online|title=Ancient Arabia: Languages and Cultures - Safaitic Database Online|last=dan|website=krc2.orient.ox.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://krc.orient.ox.ac.uk/ociana/index.php/safaitic|title=The Online Corpus of the Inscriptions of Ancient North Arabia - Safaitic|last=dan|website=krc.orient.ox.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern-style graffiti===
The first known example of "modern style"{{clarify|date=June 2018}} graffiti survives in the ancient Greek city of [[Ephesus]] (in modern-day [[Turkey]]). Local guides say it is an advertisement for [[prostitution]]. Located near a [[mosaic]] and stone walkway, the graffiti shows a handprint that vaguely resembles a heart, along with a footprint, a number, and a carved image of a woman's head. This is believed to indicate that a brothel was nearby, with the handprint symbolizing payment.&lt;ref name=joel/&gt;

The [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] carved graffiti on walls and monuments, examples of which also survive in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. Graffiti in the classical world had different connotations than they carry in today's society concerning content. Ancient graffiti displayed phrases of love declarations, political rhetoric, and simple words of thought, compared to today's popular messages of social and political ideals&lt;ref name=ancel/&gt;
The eruption of [[Vesuvius]] preserved graffiti in [[Pompeii]], which includes [[Latin]] curses, magic spells, declarations of love, alphabets, political slogans, and famous literary quotes, providing insight into ancient Roman street life. One inscription gives the address of a woman named Novellia Primigenia of Nuceria, a prostitute, apparently of great beauty, whose services were much in demand. Another shows a [[phallus]] accompanied by the text, ''mansueta tene'' ("handle with care").

Disappointed love also found its way onto walls in antiquity:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
''Quisquis amat. veniat. Veneri volo frangere costas''
''fustibus et lumbos debilitare deae.''
''Si potest illa mihi tenerum pertundere pectus''
''quit ego non possim caput illae frangere fuste?''

Whoever loves, go to hell. I want to break Venus's ribs
with a club and deform her hips.
If she can break my tender heart
why can't I hit her over the head?
&lt;/poem&gt;|''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' IV, 1824.&lt;ref&gt;CIL IV, 4200 shows a failed attempt to write this little poem, maybe because the writer forgot the verses: see F. A. Todd, "Three Pompeian Wall-Inscriptions, and Petronius" in ''The Classical Review'', Vol. 53, No. 1 (Feb., 1939), [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/706251?uid=2134&amp;uid=2476609927&amp;uid=3738296&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=3&amp;uid=2476609917&amp;uid=60&amp;sid=21104320244421 page 6 note 2] and ''Rediscovering Pompeii'', L'Erma di Bretschneider, Roma, 1990, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ciNtH6c9RDQC&amp;pg=PA39 page 39 note 85].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ancient tourists visiting the 5th-century citadel at [[Sigiriya]] in Sri Lanka scribbled over 1800 individual graffiti there between the 6th and 18th centuries. Etched on the surface of the Mirror Wall, they contain pieces of prose, poetry, and commentary. The majority of these visitors appear to have been from the elite of society: royalty, officials, professions, and clergy. There were also soldiers, archers, and even some metalworkers. The topics range from love to satire, curses, wit, and lament. Many demonstrate a very high level of literacy and a deep appreciation of art and poetry.&lt;ref name=ponnam/&gt; Most of the graffiti refer to the frescoes of semi-nude females found there. One reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Wet with cool dew drops
fragrant with perfume from the flowers
came the gentle breeze
jasmine and water lily
dance in the spring sunshine
side-long glances
of the golden-hued ladies
stab into my thoughts
heaven itself cannot take my mind
as it has been captivated by one lass
among the five hundred I have seen here.&lt;ref name=parana/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among the ancient political graffiti examples were [[Arab]] satirist poems. Yazid al-Himyari, an [[Umayyad]] [[Arab]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] poet, was most known for writing his political poetry on the walls between [[Sistan|Sajistan]] and [[Basra]], manifesting a strong hatred towards the [[Umayyad]] regime and its ''[[wali]]s'', and people used to read and circulate them very widely.&lt;ref&gt;حسين مروّة، '''تراثنا كيف نعرفه'''، مؤسسة الأبحاث العربية، بيروت، 1986{{clarify|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2014}}

===Literacy or illiteracy often revealed in graffiti===
Historic forms of graffiti have helped gain understanding into the lifestyles and languages of past cultures. Errors in spelling and grammar in these graffiti offer insight into the degree of literacy in Roman times and provide clues on the pronunciation of spoken Latin. Examples are ''CIL'' IV, 7838: ''Vettium Firmum / aed''[ilem] ''quactiliar''[ii] {{sic}} ''rog''[ant]. Here, "qu" is pronounced "co". The 83 pieces of graffiti found at ''CIL'' IV, 4706-85 are evidence of the ability to read and write at levels of society where literacy might not be expected. The graffiti appear on a [[peristyle]] which was being remodeled at the time of the eruption of Vesuvius by the architect [[Crescens]]. The graffiti were left by both the foreman and his workers. The brothel at ''CIL'' VII, 12, 18–20 contains more than 120 pieces of graffiti, some of which were the work of the prostitutes and their clients. The [[gladiator]]ial academy at ''CIL'' IV, 4397 was scrawled with graffiti left by the gladiator Celadus Crescens (''Suspirium puellarum Celadus thraex'': "Celadus the [[Thracians|Thracian]] makes the girls sigh.")

Another piece from Pompeii, written on a tavern wall about the owner of the establishment and his questionable wine:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Landlord, may your lies malign
Bring destruction on your head!
You yourself drink unmixed wine,
Water [do you] sell [to] your guests instead.&lt;ref name=olmert/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was not only the Greeks and Romans who produced graffiti: the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] site of [[Tikal]] in [[Guatemala]] contains examples of [[ancient Maya graffiti]]. [[Viking]] graffiti survive in Rome and at [[Newgrange|Newgrange Mound]] in Ireland, and a [[Varangian]] scratched his name (Halvdan) in [[Runic alphabet|rune]]s on a [[banister]] in the [[Hagia Sophia]] at [[Constantinople]]. These early forms of graffiti have contributed to the understanding of lifestyles and languages of past cultures.

Graffiti, known as Tacherons, were frequently scratched on Romanesque Scandinavian church walls.&lt;ref name=green/&gt;
When [[Renaissance]] artists such as [[Pinturicchio]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], or [[Filippino Lippi]] descended into the ruins of Nero's [[Domus Aurea]], they carved or painted their names and returned to initiate the ''[[grottesche]]'' style of decoration.&lt;ref name="archeology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="atlantic"/&gt;

There are also examples of graffiti occurring in American history, such as [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]], a national landmark along the [[Oregon Trail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Independence Rock - California National Historic Trail (National Park Service)|url=https://www.nps.gov/cali/planyourvisit/site5.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, French soldiers carved their names on monuments during the Napoleonic [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1798|campaign of Egypt]] in the 1790s.&lt;ref name=JinxArtCrimes/&gt; [[Lord Byron]]'s survives on one of the columns of the Temple of [[Poseidon]] at [[Cape Sounion]] in [[Attica]], Greece.&lt;ref name=shanks/&gt;

== Contemporary graffiti ==
Graffiti writing is often intertwined with [[hip hop culture]]&lt;ref name="genius-paul-edwards-hiphopbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/Paul-edwards-is-graffiti-really-an-element-of-hip-hop-book-excerpt-annotated|title=Is Graffiti Really An Element Of Hip-Hop?

However, there are many other instances of notable graffiti in the twentieth century. Graffiti have long appeared on building walls, in [[latrine]]s, railroad [[boxcar]]s, [[rapid transit|subways]], and bridges. The oldest known example of modern graffiti is found on traincars created by hobos and railworkers started more than eighty years ago, called Bozo Texino, documented by filmmaker [[Bill Daniel (filmmaker)|Bill Daniel]] in his 2005 film, ''Who is Bozo Texino?''.&lt;ref name="bozo-texino-walker"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://walkerart.org/calendar/2010/who-is-bozo-texino|title=Who Is Bozo Texino?|date=22 July 2010|accessdate=23 August 2018|first=Bill|last=Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bozo-texino-film"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billdaniel.net/who-is-bozo-texino/|title=Who Is Bozo Texino?|date=2005|work=Who Is Bozo Texino?

Some graffiti have their own poignancy. In [[World War II]], an inscription on a wall at the fortress of [[Verdun]] was seen as an illustration of the US response twice in a generation to the wrongs of the Old World:&lt;ref name=reagan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/14/opinion/words-from-a-war.html|title=Words From a War|date=14 August 1985|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Austin White – Chicago, Ill – 1918
Austin White – Chicago, Ill – 1945
This is the last time I want to write my name here.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During World War II and for decades after, the phrase "[[Kilroy was here]]" with an accompanying illustration was widespread throughout the world, due to its use by American troops and ultimately filtering into American popular culture. Shortly after the death of [[Charlie Parker]] (nicknamed "Yardbird" or "Bird"), graffiti began appearing around New York with the words "Bird Lives".&lt;ref name=russel/&gt; The student protests and general strike of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] saw Paris bedecked in revolutionary, anarchistic, and situationist slogans such as ''L'ennui est contre-révolutionnaire'' ("Boredom is counterrevolutionary") expressed in painted graffiti, [[poster]] art, and [[stencil]] art. At the time in the US, other political phrases (such as "Free Huey" about [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] [[Huey Newton]]) became briefly popular as graffiti in limited areas, only to be forgotten. A popular graffito of the early 1970s was "Dick [[Richard Milhous Nixon|Nixon]] Before He Dicks You", reflecting the hostility of the youth culture to that US president.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Advent of aerosol paint===
Rock and roll graffiti is a significant subgenre. A famous graffito of the twentieth century was the inscription in the London tube reading "Clapton is God" in a link to the guitarist [[Eric Clapton]]. The phrase was spray-painted by an admirer on a wall in an [[Islington]] station on the [[London Underground|Underground]] in the autumn of 1967. The graffito was captured in a photograph, in which a dog is [[Urine marking#Canidae|urinating on the wall]].

Graffiti also became associated with the anti-establishment [[punk rock]] movement beginning in the 1970s. Bands such as [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and [[Crass]] (and their followers) widely [[stencil]]ed their names and logos, while many punk night clubs, squats, and hangouts are famous for their graffiti. In the late 1980s the upside down Martini glass that was the tag for punk band [[Missing Foundation]] was the most ubiquitous graffito in lower Manhattan, and was copied by hard core punk fans throughout the US and West Germany.&lt;ref name=myspace/&gt;

Along similar lines was the legend "[[Frodo Lives!|Frodo Lives]]," referring to the protagonist of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Spread of hip hop culture===
In 1979, graffiti artist [[Lee Quinones]] and [[Fab Five Freddy|Fab 5 Freddy]] were given a gallery opening in Rome by art dealer Claudio Bruni. For many outside of New York, it was their first encounter with their art form. Fab 5 Freddy's friendship with [[Debbie Harry]] influenced [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s single "[[Rapture (Blondie song)|Rapture]]" ([[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]], 1981), the video of which featured [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], and offered many their first glimpse of a depiction of elements of graffiti in hip hop culture. JaJaJa toured Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, and Holland with a large graffiti canvas as a backdrop.&lt;ref name=chesh/&gt; Charlie Ahearn's independently released fiction film ''[[Wild Style]]'' (Wild Style, 1983), the early [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary ''[[Style Wars]]'' (1983), hit songs such as "[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]" and "[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]" and their accompanying [[music video]]s (both 1982) contributed to a growing interest outside New York in all aspects of hip hop.&lt;ref name="genius-paul-edwards-hiphopbook" /&gt;

''Style Wars'' depicted not only famous graffiti artists such as Skeme, [[DONDI|Dondi]], MinOne, and [[Zephyr (artist)|ZEPHYR]], but also reinforced graffiti's role within New York's emerging hip-hop culture by incorporating famous early break-dancing groups such as Rock Steady Crew into the film and featuring rap in the soundtrack. Although many officers of the New York City Police Department found this film to be controversial, Style Wars is still recognized as the most prolific film representation of what was going on within the young hip hop culture of the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=labonte/&gt; Fab 5 Freddy and Futura 2000 took hip hop graffiti to Paris and London as part of the New York City Rap Tour in 1983.&lt;ref name=hershk/&gt; Hollywood also paid attention, consulting writers such as [[PHASE 2]] as it depicted the culture and gave it international exposure in movies such as ''[[Beat Street]]'' ([[Orion Pictures|Orion]], 1984).

===Stencil graffiti emerges===
This period also saw the emergence of the new [[stencil graffiti]] genre. Some of the first examples were created in 1981 by graffiti artist [[Blek le Rat]] in Paris, in 1982 by [[Jef Aerosol]] in Tours (France);{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} by 1985 stencils had appeared in other cities including New York City, Sydney, and [[Melbourne]], where they were documented by American photographer Charles Gatewood and Australian photographer Rennie Ellis.&lt;ref name=ellis/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Graffiti as a memorial===
People often leave their traces in wet cement or concrete. This type of graffito often commemorates the mutual commitment of a couple, or simply records a person's presence at a particular moment. Often this type of graffito is dated and is left untouched for decades, offering a look into local historical minutiae.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Commercialization and entrance into mainstream pop culture===
{{Main|Commercial graffiti}}
With the popularity and legitimization of graffiti has come a level of commercialization. In 2001, computer giant [[IBM]] launched an advertising campaign in Chicago and San Francisco which involved people spray painting on sidewalks a [[peace symbol]], a [[Heart (symbol)|heart]], and a [[penguin]] ([[Linux]] [[mascot]]), to represent "Peace, Love, and Linux." Due to laws forbidding it, some of the "street artists" were arrested and charged with vandalism, and IBM was fined more than US$120,000 for punitive damages and clean-up costs.&lt;ref name=guerilla/&gt;&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;

In 2005, a similar ad campaign was launched by [[Sony]] and executed by [[TATS CRU]] in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Miami, to market its handheld [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] gaming system. In [[PlayStation Portable#Controversial advertising campaigns|this campaign]], taking notice of the legal problems of the IBM campaign, Sony paid building owners for the rights to paint on their buildings "a collection of dizzy-eyed urban kids playing with the PSP as if it were a skateboard, a paddle, or a rocking horse".&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;

===Gamer culture===
Along with the commercial growth has come the rise of [[video game]]s also depicting graffiti, usually in a positive aspect – for example, the ''[[Jet Set Radio]]'' series (2000–2003) tells the story of a group of teens fighting the oppression of a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] police force that attempts to limit the graffiti artists' [[freedom of speech]]. In plotlines mirroring the negative reaction of non-commercial artists to the commercialization of the art form by companies such as IBM (and, later, Sony itself) the ''[[Graffiti Kingdom|Rakugaki Ōkoku]]'' series (2003–2005) for Sony's [[PlayStation 2]] revolves around an anonymous hero and his magically imbued-with-life graffiti creations as they struggle against an evil king who only allows art to be produced which can benefit him. Following the original roots of modern graffiti as a political force came another game title, ''[[Marc Eckō's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure]]'' (2006), featuring a story line involving fighting against a corrupt city and its oppression of free speech, as in the ''Jet Set Radio'' series.

Other games which feature graffiti include ''[[Klark Kent|Bomb the World]]'' (2004), an online graffiti simulation created by graffiti artist [[Klark Kent]] where users can paint trains virtually at 20 locations worldwide, and ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' (2002), in which the hero, [[Mario]] must clean the city of graffiti left by the villain, [[Bowser Jr.]] in a plotline which evokes the successes of the Anti-Graffiti Task Force of New York's Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani|Rudolph Giuliani]] (a manifestation of the "[[Fixing Broken Windows|broken window theory]]") or those of the "[[Graffiti Blasters]]" of Chicago's Mayor [[Richard M. Daley]].

Numerous other non-graffiti-centric video games allow the player to produce graffiti (such as the [[Half-Life (series)|''Half-Life'' series]], the [[Tony Hawk's (series)|''Tony Hawk's'' series]], ''[[The Urbz: Sims in the City]]'', ''[[Rolling (video game)|Rolling]]'', and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]''). ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]'', which is a ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' mod, allows users to create their own graffiti tags to use in the game. Many other titles contain in-game depictions of graffiti, including ''[[The Darkness (video game)|The Darkness]]'', ''[[Double Dragon (series)#Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone|Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone]]'', ''[[NetHack]]'', ''[[Samurai Champloo: Sidetracked]]'', ''[[The World Ends with You]]'', ''[[The Warriors (video game)|The Warriors]]'', ''[[Just Cause (video game)|Just Cause]]'', ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'', and various examples of [[Virtual Graffiti#Gaming|Virtual Graffiti]]. There also exist games where the term "graffiti" is used as a synonym for "drawing" (such as ''[[Yahoo! Graffiti]]'', ''[[ImagiNation Network#SierraLand|Graffiti]]'', etc.).

===Advocates===
[[Marc Ecko]], an urban clothing designer, has been an advocate of graffiti as an art form during this period, stating that "Graffiti is without question the most powerful art movement in recent history and has been a driving inspiration throughout my career."&lt;ref name=sohh/&gt;

[[Henry Chalfant]] is one of the foremost advocates of modern graffiti, having produced the documentary film [[Style Wars]] and co-authored the books ''[[Subway Art]]'' and ''Spray Can Art''. His most recent work, ''Henry Chalfant's Graffiti Archive: New York City's Subway Art and Artists'' displays his over 800 photographs of New York City Subway Graffiti Art.&lt;ref name=chalf/&gt;

[[Keith Haring]] was another well-known graffiti artist who brought Pop Art and graffiti to the commercial mainstream. In the 1980s, Haring opened his first Pop Shop: a store that offered everyone access to his works, which until then could only be found spray-painted on city walls. Pop Shop offered commodities such as bags and t-shirts. Haring explained that "The Pop Shop makes my work accessible. It's about participation on a big level, the point was that we didn't want to produce things that would cheapen the art. In other words, this was still art as statement."&lt;ref name="haring-foundation-site"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haring.com/!/pop-shop|title=Pop Shop|date=2018|work=The Keith Haring Foundation Website|accessdate=23 August 2018|first=Keith|last=Haring}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graffiti have become a common stepping stone for many members of both the [[art and design]] communities in North America and abroad. Within the United States graffiti artists such as Mike Giant, Pursue, Rime, Noah, and countless others have made careers in skateboard, apparel, and shoe design for companies such as DC Shoes, Adidas, Rebel8, Osiris, or Circa&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Meanwhile, there are many others such as DZINE, Daze, Blade, and The Mac who have made the switch to being gallery artists, often not even using their initial medium, spray paint.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

But perhaps the greatest example of graffiti artists infiltrating mainstream pop culture is the French crew [[123Klan]].  Founded as a graffiti crew in 1989 by Scien and Klor, 123Klan has gradually turned their hands to illustration and design while still maintaining their graffiti practice and style. In doing so they have designed and produced logos and illustrations, shoes, and fashion for the likes of Nike, Adidas, Lamborghini, Coca Cola, Stussy, Sony, Nasdaq, and more.&lt;ref name=grafica/&gt;&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Yarnbus.jpg|thumb|This bus has been [[yarn bombing|yarn bombed]] by a team of knitters. {{Deletable image-caption|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;

===Global developments===

====South America====
There is a significant graffiti tradition in South America, especially in [[Brazil]]. Within Brazil, [[São Paulo]] is a significant centre of inspiration for many graffiti artists worldwide.&lt;ref name=manco/&gt;

Tristan Manco wrote that Brazil "boasts a unique and particularly rich, graffiti scene&amp;nbsp;... [earning] it an international reputation as the place to go for artistic inspiration." Graffiti "flourishes in every conceivable space in Brazil's cities." Artistic parallels "are often drawn between the energy of São Paulo today and 1970s New York." The "sprawling metropolis," of São Paulo has "become the new shrine to graffiti;" Manco alludes to "poverty and unemployment&amp;nbsp;... [and] the epic struggles and conditions of the country's marginalised peoples," and to "Brazil's chronic poverty," as the main engines that "have fuelled a vibrant graffiti culture." In world terms, Brazil has "one of the most uneven distributions of income. Laws and taxes change frequently." Such factors, Manco argues, contribute to a very fluid society, riven with those economic divisions and social tensions that underpin and feed the "folkloric vandalism and an urban sport for the disenfranchised," that is South American graffiti art.&lt;ref name=manco7/&gt;

Prominent Brazilian graffiti artists include [[Os Gêmeos]], Boleta, [[Francisco Rodrigues da Silva|Nunca]], Nina, Speto, Tikka, and T.Freak.&lt;ref name=globo/&gt; Their artistic success and involvement in commercial design ventures&lt;ref name=nicek/&gt; has highlighted divisions within the Brazilian graffiti community between adherents of the cruder transgressive form of ''pichação'' and the more conventionally artistic values of the practitioners of ''grafite''.&lt;ref name=revela/&gt;

====Middle East====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:IMG 6754 3.jpg|thumb|Poetry graffiti in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]]] --&gt;[[File:Graffiti in Tel Aviv, Israel.jpg|thumb|A graffiti piece found in Tel Aviv by the artist DeDe]]
Graffiti in the [[Middle East]] is emerging slowly, with pockets of taggers operating in the various 'Emirates' of the [[United Arab Emirates]], in [[Israel]], and in [[Iran]]. The major Iranian newspaper ''[[Hamshahri]]'' has published two articles on illegal writers in the city with photographic coverage of Iranian artist [[A1one]]'s works on Tehran walls. Tokyo-based design magazine, ''PingMag'', has interviewed A1one and featured photographs of his work.&lt;ref name=pinmag/&gt; The [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] has become a site for graffiti, reminiscent in this sense of the [[Berlin Wall]]. Many graffiti artists in Israel come from other places around the globe, such as JUIF from Los Angeles and DEVIONE from London. The religious reference  "נ נח נחמ נחמן מאומן" ("[[Na Nach Nachma Nachman Meuman]]") is commonly seen in graffiti around Israel.

====Southeast Asia====
There are also a large number of graffiti influences in [[Southeast Asia]]n countries that mostly come from modern [[Western culture]], such as Malaysia, where graffiti have long been a common sight in Malaysia's capital city, [[Kuala Lumpur]]. Since 2010, the country has begun hosting a street festival to encourage all generations and people from all walks of life to enjoy and encourage Malaysian street culture.&lt;ref name=kharbar/&gt;

== Characteristics of common graffiti ==
{{See also|Graffiti terminology|Graffiti in the United States}}

===Methods and production===
The modern-day graffiti artist can be found with an arsenal of various materials that allow for a successful production of a piece.&lt;ref name=nicolas/&gt; This includes such techniques as [[Scribing (graffiti)|scribing]]. However, [[spray paint]] in aerosol cans is the number one medium for graffiti. From this commodity comes different styles, technique, and abilities to form master works of graffiti. Spray paint can be found at hardware and art stores and comes in virtually every color.

[[Stencil graffiti]], originating in the early 1980s ([[Blek le Rat]], [[Jef Aerosol]], [[Speedy Graphito]], [[Miss Tic]] ... ) is created by cutting out shapes and designs in a stiff material (such as [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]] or subject [[File folder|folder]]s) to form an overall design or image.&lt;ref name=drupal/&gt; The stencil is then placed on the "canvas" gently and with quick, easy strokes of the aerosol can, the image begins to appear on the intended surface. This method of graffiti is popular amongst artists because of its swift technique that requires very little time. Time is always a factor with graffiti artists due to the constant threat of being caught by law enforcement.

[[File:Spiderweb Yarnbomb Installation by Stephen Duneier.JPG|thumbnail|Spiderweb Yarnbomb Installation by Stephen Duneier both hides and highlights previous graffiti.]]
Modern graffiti art often incorporates additional arts and technologies. For example, [[Graffiti Research Lab]] has encouraged the use of projected images and magnetic light-emitting diodes ([[LED art|throwies]]) as new media for graffiti artists. [[Yarnbombing]] is another recent form of graffiti. Yarnbombers occasionally target previous graffiti for modification, which had been avoided among the majority of graffiti artists.

===Tagging===

Some of the most common styles of graffiti have their own names. A '''tag''' is the most basic writing of an artist's name; it is simply a [[handstyle]]. A graffiti writer's tag is his or her personalized signature. Tagging is often the example given when opponents of graffiti refer to any acts of handstyle graffiti writing (it is by far the most common form of graffiti). Tags can contain subtle and sometimes cryptic messages, and may incorporate the artist's crew initials or other letters.

One form of tagging, known as '''pissing''', involves taking a refillable fire-extinguisher and replacing the contents with paint, allowing for tags as high as approximately {{convert|20|ft|m}}. Aiming and keeping a handstyle steady in this form of tagging is very difficult, usually coming out wavy and sloppy.

Another form is the '''throw-up''', also known as a '''bombing''', which is normally painted very quickly with two or three colors, sacrificing aesthetics for speed. Throw-ups can also be outlined on a surface with one color. A '''piece''' is a more elaborate representation of the artist's name, incorporating more stylized letters, usually incorporating a much larger range of colors. This is more time-consuming and increases the likelihood of the artist getting caught. A '''blockbuster''' or '''roller''' is a large piece, almost always done in a block-shaped style, done simply to cover a large area solidly with two contrasting colors, sometimes with the whole purpose of blocking other writers from painting on the same wall. These are usually accomplished with extended paint rollers and gallons of cheap exterior paint.

A more complex style is '''[[wildstyle]]''', a form of graffiti usually involving interlocking letters and connecting points. These pieces are often harder to read by non-graffiti artists as the letters merge into one another in an often-undecipherable manner.

Some artists also use self-adhesive '''stickers''' as a quick way to do catch ups. While certain critics from within graffiti culture consider this lazy, stickers can be quite detailed in their own right and often, are used in conjunction with other materials. Sticker tags are commonly executed on blank postage stickers, as these can easily be acquired with no cost on the writer's part.

Many graffiti artists believe that doing complex pieces involves too great an investment of time to justify the practice. Doing a piece can take (depending on experience and size) from 30 minutes to months on end, as was the case for [[Saber (artist)|Saber]] MSK while working on the world's largest graffiti piece on the LA river.

Another graffiti artist can go over a piece in a matter of minutes with a simple throw-up. This was exemplified by the writer "CAP" in the documentary ''[[Style Wars]]'', who, other writers complain, ruins pieces with his quick throw ups. This became known as '''capping''' and often is done when there is a "beef", or conflict between writers.

A number of recent examples of graffiti make use of [[hashtags]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.fitzrovia.org.uk/2015/07/23/hashtag-on-the-pavement-connects-with-fitzrovias-past/] "Hashtag on the pavement connects with Fitzrovia's past", Fitzrovia News, 23 July 2015, Retrieved 17 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://massappeal.com/riskrock-graffiti-in-san-francisco/] "#RISKROCK #GRAFFITI IN #SANFRANCISCO", Mass Appeal, Retrieved 17 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
Theories on the use of graffiti by [[avant-garde]] artists have a history dating back at least to the [[Scandinavian Institute of Comparative Vandalism]] in 1961.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Many contemporary analysts and even art critics have begun to see artistic value in some graffiti and to recognize it as a form of [[public art]]. According to many art researchers, particularly in the Netherlands and in Los Angeles, that type of public art is, in fact an effective tool of social [[political emancipation|emancipation]] or, in the achievement of a political goal.&lt;ref name=thimar/&gt;

The murals of [[Belfast]] and of Los Angeles offer another example of official recognition.&lt;ref name=rpmural/&gt; In times of conflict, such murals have offered a means of communication and self-expression for members of these socially, ethnically, or racially divided communities, and have proven themselves as effective tools in establishing dialog and thus, of addressing cleavages in the long run. The [[Berlin Wall]] was also extensively covered by graffiti reflecting social pressures relating to the oppressive [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule over the [[East Germany|GDR]].

Many artists involved with graffiti are also concerned with the similar activity of [[stenciling]]. Essentially, this entails stenciling a print of one or more colors using spray-paint. Recognized while [[Art exhibition|exhibiting]] and publishing several of her coloured stencils and paintings portraying the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] and [[Urban area|urban Britain]] in the early 2000s, graffiti artist [[M.I.A. (artist)|Mathangi Arulpragasam, aka M.I.A.]], has also become known for integrating her imagery of political violence into her [[music videos]] for singles "[[Galang (song)|Galang]]" and "[[Bucky Done Gun]]", and her cover art. Stickers of her artwork also often appear around places such as London in [[Brick Lane]], stuck to lamp posts and street signs, she having become a muse for other graffiti artists and painters worldwide in cities including [[Seville]].&lt;ref name=teleci/&gt; Graffiti artist [[John Fekner]], called "caption writer to the urban environment, adman for the opposition" by writer [[Lucy Lippard]],&lt;ref name=lippard/&gt; was involved in direct art interventions within New York City's [[Urban decay|decaying]] urban environment in the mid-1970s through the 1980s. Fekner is known for his word installations targeting social and political issues, stenciled on buildings throughout New York.

=== Personal expression ===
[[File:27 club Graffiti in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[27 Club Graffiti in Tel Aviv]] celebrating personal expression]]Graffiti artists constantly have the looming threat of facing consequences for displaying their graffiti. Many choose to protect their identities and reputation by remaining anonymous.

With the commercialization of graffiti (and [[hip hop]] in general), in most cases, even with legally painted "graffiti" art, graffiti artists tend to choose anonymity. This may be attributed to various reasons or a combination of reasons. Graffiti still remains the [[hip hop#Cultural pillars|one of four hip hop elements]] that is not considered "performance art" despite the image of the "singing and dancing star" that sells hip hop culture to the mainstream. Being a graphic form of art, it might also be said that many graffiti artists still fall in the category of the [[Extraversion and introversion#Introversion|introverted archetypal artist]].

[[Banksy]] is one of the world's most notorious and popular street artists who continues to remain faceless in today's society.&lt;ref name=banksy/&gt; He is known for his political, anti-war stencil art mainly in [[Bristol, England]], but his work may be seen anywhere from Los Angeles to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. In the UK, Banksy is the most recognizable icon for this cultural artistic movement and keeps his identity a secret to avoid arrest. Much of Banksy's artwork may be seen around the streets of London and surrounding suburbs, although he has painted pictures throughout the world, including the Middle East, where he has painted on Israel's controversial [[West Bank]] barrier with satirical images of life on the other side. One depicted a hole in the wall with an idyllic beach, while another shows a mountain landscape on the other side. A number of [[Art exhibition|exhibitions]] also have taken place since 2000, and recent works of art have fetched vast sums of money. Banksy's art is a prime example of the classic controversy: vandalism vs. art. Art supporters endorse his work distributed in urban areas as pieces of art and some councils, such as Bristol and Islington, have officially protected them, while officials of other areas have deemed his work to be vandalism and have removed it.

[[Pixnit]] is another artist who chooses to keep her identity from the general public.&lt;ref name=shaer/&gt; Her work focuses on beauty and design aspects of graffiti as opposed to Banksy's anti-government shock value. Her paintings are often of flower designs above shops and stores in her local urban area of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Some store owners endorse her work and encourage others to do similar work as well. "One of the pieces was left up above Steve's Kitchen, because it looks pretty awesome"- Erin Scott, the manager of [[New England Comics]] in [[Allston, Massachusetts]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

=== Radical and political ===
[[File:M2109 Iraq War Protest (Black Bloc Element).jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|[[Black bloc]] members spray graffiti on a wall during an [[Protests against the Iraq War#March 21, 2009|Iraq War Protest]] in Washington, D.C.]]
Graffiti often has a reputation as part of a subculture that rebels against authority, although the considerations of the practitioners often diverge and can relate to a wide range of attitudes. It can express a political practice and can form just one tool in an array of resistance techniques. One early example includes the [[anarcho-punk]] band [[Crass]], who conducted a campaign of stenciling [[anti-war]], [[anarchism|anarchist]], [[feminism|feminist]], and [[consumerism|anti-consumerist]] messages throughout the [[London Underground]] system during the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name=souther/&gt; In [[Amsterdam]] graffiti was a major part of the punk scene. The city was covered with names such as "De Zoot", "Vendex", and "Dr Rat".&lt;ref name=stockho/&gt; To document the graffiti a punk magazine was started that was called ''Gallery Anus''. So when hip hop came to Europe in the early 1980s there was already a vibrant graffiti culture.

The student protests and general strike of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] saw Paris bedecked in revolutionary, anarchistic, and situationist slogans such as ''L'ennui est contre-révolutionnaire'' ("Boredom is counterrevolutionary") and ''Lisez moins, vivez plus'' ("Read less, live more"). While not exhaustive, the graffiti gave a sense of the 'millenarian' and rebellious spirit, tempered with a good deal of verbal wit, of the strikers.

{{quote box|align=right|width=220px|quote=I think graffiti writing is a way of defining what our generation is like. Excuse the French, we're not a bunch of p---- artists. Traditionally artists have been considered soft and mellow people, a little bit kooky. Maybe we're a little bit more like pirates that way. We defend our territory, whatever space we steal to paint on, we defend it fiercely.|source=—Sandra "Lady Pink" Fabara&lt;ref name=chang/&gt;}}

The developments of graffiti art which took place in art galleries and colleges as well as "on the street" or "underground", contributed to the resurfacing in the 1990s of a far more overtly politicized art form in the [[subvertising]], [[culture jamming]], or tactical media movements. These movements or styles tend to classify the artists by their relationship to their social and economic contexts, since, in most countries, graffiti art remains illegal in many forms except when using non-permanent paint. Since the 1990s with the rise of [[Street Art]], a growing number of artists are switching to non-permanent paints and non-traditional forms of painting&lt;ref name="ziptopia-switch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zipcar.com/ziptopia/city-living/temporary-street-art-changing-the-graffiti-game|title=Temporary Street Art That's Changing The Graffiti Game|work=Ziptopia|first=STEVEN|last=HARRINGTON |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffpost-streetart"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/ron-english/street-art-its-not-meant-_b_5610496.html|title=Street Art: It's Not Meant to be Permanent|work=Huffington Post|first=Ron|last=English|date=6 Dec 2017|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a variety of reasons—but primarily because is it difficult for the police to apprehend them and for the courts to sentence or even convict a person for a protest that is as fleeting and less intrusive than marching in the streets. In some communities, such impermanent works survive longer than works created with permanent paints because the community views the work in the same vein as that of the civil protester who marches in the street—such protest are impermanent, but effective nevertheless.

In some areas where a number of artists share the impermanence ideal, an informal competition develops:  the length of time that a work escapes destruction is viewed as a measure of the respect the work garners in the community. A crude work that deserves little respect would be invariably removed immediately, while the most talented artists might have works last for days.

Contemporary practitioners, accordingly, have varied and often conflicting practices. Some individuals, such as [[Alexander Brener]], have used the medium to politicize other art forms, and have used the prison sentences enforced on them as a means of further protest.&lt;ref name="voice" /&gt;
The practices of anonymous groups and individuals also vary widely, and practitioners by no means always agree with each other's practices. For example, the anti-capitalist art group the [[Space Hijackers]] did a piece in 2004 about the contradiction between the capitalistic elements of Banksy and his use of political [[imagery]].&lt;ref name="tanyabaxter-Gallery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tanyabaxtercontemporary.com/banksy#!Banksy_Flying_Copper__screen_print_on_paper__100_x_70_cm|title= Banksy |work=Tanya Baxter Contemporary Gallery|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haynes-banksy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haynesfineart.com/artists/Banksy--|title= Banksy |work=Haynes Fine Art|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On top of the political aspect of graffiti as a [[Cultural movement|movement]], political groups and individuals may also use graffiti as a tool to spread their [[perspective (cognitive)|point of view]]. This practice, due to its illegality, has generally become favored by groups excluded from the political mainstream (e.g. [[far-left]] or [[far-right]] groups) who justify their activity by pointing out that they do not have the money – or sometimes the desire – to buy [[advertising]] to get their message across, and that a "[[ruling class]]" or "establishment" controls the mainstream press, systematically excluding the radical and alternative point of view. This type of graffiti can seem crude; for example [[Fascism|fascist]] supporters often scrawl [[swastika]]s and other [[Nazism|Nazi]] images.

One innovative form of graffiti that emerged in the UK in the 1970s was devised by the Money Liberation Front (MLF), essentially a loose affiliation of [[underground press]] writers such as the poet and playwright [[Heathcote Williams]] and magazine editor and playwright Jay Jeff Jones. They initiated the use of paper currency as a medium for [[counterculture]] propaganda, overprinting banknotes, usually with a [[John Bull]] printing set. Although short lived, the MLF was representative of London's [[Ladbroke Grove]] centered alternative and literary community of the period. The area was also a scene of considerable [[anti-establishment]] and humorous street graffiti, much of which is also produced by Williams.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; In 2009, following the elections in Iran, protesters (who regarded the electoral result as rigged) began to deface banknotes with slogans such as "Death to the dictator". In Colombia writing and drawing on banknotes has become increasingly popular, either to make political comments, for fun or as an artistic medium. The national government has run advertising campaigns in an attempt to discourage the practice. In the UK there have been signs of an MLF resurgence with a number of banknotes in circulation being over-marked with protest slogans such as "Banks=Robbers", relating to the perceived culpability of banks in the financial crisis.

Both sides of the conflict in [[Northern Ireland]] produce political graffiti. As well as slogans, Northern Irish political graffiti includes large wall paintings, referred to as ''[[Northern Irish murals|murals]]''. Along with the flying of flags and the painting of kerb stones, the murals serve a territorial purpose, often associated with gang use. Artists paint them mostly on house gables or on the ''[[Belfast Peace Lines|Peace Lines]]'', high walls that separate different communities.

The murals often develop over an extended period and tend to stylization, with a strong symbolic or [[iconographic]] content. [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist]] murals often refer to historical events dating from the war between [[James II of England|James II]] and [[William III of England|William III]] in the late seventeenth century, whereas [[Irish Republicanism|Republican]] murals usually refer to the more recent [[The Troubles|troubles]].

Territorial graffiti marks urban neighborhoods with tags and logos to differentiate certain groups from others. These images are meant to show outsiders a stern look at whose turf is whose. The subject matter of gang-related graffiti consists of cryptic [[symbols]] and [[initials]] strictly fashioned with unique [[calligraphies]]. Gang members use graffiti to designate membership throughout the gang, to differentiate rivals and associates and, most commonly, to mark borders which are both territorial and ideological.&lt;ref name=ley/&gt;

=== As advertising ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}
Graffiti has been used as a means of advertising both legally and illegally. [[The Bronx|Bronx]]-based [[TATS CRU]] has made a name for themselves doing legal advertising campaigns for companies such as [[Coca-Cola]], [[McDonald's]], [[Toyota]], and [[MTV]]. In the UK, Covent Garden's [[Boxfresh]] used stencil images of a [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] revolutionary in the hopes that cross referencing would promote their store.

Tech Giants Hewlett Packard used graffiti company [[Darren Cullen#Graffiti Kings|Graffiti Kings]] based in London to showcase the creative use for their Sprout computer by producing a video, during the video Hewlett Packard showed many pieces of graffiti art while the Graffiti Kings artist used the Sprout computer to draw digital graffiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11408538/HP-Sprout-is-this-the-future-of-desktop-computing.html|title=HP Sprout: is this the future of desktop computing?|newspaper= Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graffitikings.co.uk/hp-hewlett-packard-sprout-graffiti-kings/|title=
HP – Hewlett Packard Sprout &amp; Graffiti Kings|website= Graffitikings|date=2015-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smirnoff]] hired artists to use [[reverse graffiti]] (the use of high pressure hoses to clean dirty surfaces to leave a clean image in the surrounding dirt) to increase awareness of their product. [[Shepard Fairey]] rose to fame after his "Andre the Giant Has a Posse" sticker campaign, in which his art was plastered in cities throughout America.

Many graffiti artists see legal advertising as no more than "paid for and legalised graffiti", and have risen against mainstream ads. The [[Graffiti Research Lab]] crew have gone on to target several prominent ads in New York as a means of making a statement against this practice.

=== Offensive graffiti ===
[[File:Stop graffitti.jpg|thumb|Gang symbol markings on public property, [[Millwood, Washington]]]]
Graffiti may also be used as an offensive expression. This form of graffiti may be difficult to identify, as it is mostly removed by the local authority (as councils which have adopted strategies of criminalization also strive to remove graffiti quickly).&lt;ref name=halsey/&gt; Therefore, existing racist graffiti is mostly more subtle and at first sight, not easily recognized as "racist". It can then only be understood if one knows the relevant "local code" (social, historical, political, temporal, and spatial), which is seen as [[heteroglossia|heteroglot]] and thus a 'unique set of conditions' in a cultural context.&lt;ref name=holqu/&gt;
:A spatial code for example, could be that there is a certain youth group in an area that is engaging heavily in racist activities. So, for residents (knowing the local code), a graffiti containing only the name or abbreviation of this gang already is a racist expression, reminding the offended people of their gang activities. Also a graffiti is in most cases, the [[herald]] of more serious criminal activity to come.&lt;ref name=kelling/&gt; A person who does not know these gang activities would not be able to recognize the meaning of this graffiti. Also if a tag of this youth group or gang is placed on a building occupied by asylum seekers, for example, its racist character is even stronger.
Hence, the lack of obvious racist graffiti does not necessarily mean that there is none. By making the graffiti less explicit (as adapted to social and legal constraints),&lt;ref name=barker/&gt; these drawings are less likely to be removed, but do not lose their threatening and offensive character.&lt;ref name=lynn/&gt;

Elsewhere, activists in Russia have used painted [[caricature]]s of local officials with their mouths as [[pothole]]s, to show their anger about the poor state of the roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schreck |first=Carl |date=2015-06-19 |title=Russian politicians mocked with guerrilla pothole portraits |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/19/russia-pothole-portraits-activists-banksy |website= New East Network |access-date=2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Manchester, England]] a graffiti artist painted obscene images around potholes, which often resulted in their being repaired within 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2015-04-29 |title=Meet the man using penises to fill potholes |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/11570595/Meet-the-man-using-penises-to-fill-potholes.html |website= The Telegraph |access-date=2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 exhibition at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] displayed graffiti as an art form that began in New York's [[outer boroughs]] and reached great heights in the early 1980s with the work of Crash, Lee, Daze, [[Keith Haring]], and [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]]. It displayed 22 works by New York graffiti artists, including [[Crash (graffiti artist)|Crash]], Daze, and [[Lady Pink]]. In an article about the exhibition in the magazine ''Time Out'', curator Charlotta Kotik said that she hoped the exhibition would cause viewers to rethink their assumptions about graffiti. [[Terrance Lindall]], an artist and executive director of the Williamsburg Art and Historic Center, said regarding graffiti and the exhibition:&lt;ref name=tonyk/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Graffiti is revolutionary, in my opinion", he says, "and any revolution might be considered a crime. People who are oppressed or suppressed need an outlet, so they write on walls—it's free."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the 1970s onwards, [[Burhan Dogancay]] photographed urban walls all over the world; these he then archived for use as sources of inspiration for his painterly works. The project today known as "Walls of the World" grew beyond even his own expectations and comprises about 30,000 individual images. It spans a period of 40 years across five continents and 114 countries. In 1982, photographs from this project comprised a one-man exhibition titled "Les murs murmurent, ils crient, ils chantent..." (The walls whisper, shout and sing ... ) at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in [[Paris]].

In Australia, art historians have judged some local graffiti of sufficient creative merit to rank them firmly within the arts. [[Oxford University Press]]'s art history text ''Australian Painting 1788–2000'' concludes with a long discussion of graffiti's key place within contemporary [[visual culture]], including the work of several Australian practitioners.&lt;ref name=smithea/&gt;

Between March and April 2009, 150 artists exhibited 300 pieces of graffiti at the [[Grand Palais]] in Paris — a clear acceptance of the art form into the French [[art world]].&lt;ref name=rfi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rohter/&gt;

Many graffiti artists have used their design talents in other artistic endeavors. In 2009 graffiti artist "[[Scape (graffiti artist)|Scape]]" published ''GRAFF; the Art &amp; Technique of Graffiti'', the world's first book dedicated to displaying the full techniques of creating graffiti art. Other books that focus on graffiti include ''Faith of Graffiti'' by Norman Mailer, ''Trespass'' by Taschen press,&lt;ref name=urbana/&gt; and the comic book by [[Elite Gudz]], ''Concrete Immortalz'', which has a graffiti artist as its main character.

Figurines by [[KAWS (artist)|KAWS]], featuring icons of pop culture, often with crossed-out eyes, run in limited editions and sell for thousands of dollars.&lt;ref name=intmag/&gt; World-renowned street artist Banksy directed a film in 2010, ''[[Exit Through the Gift Shop]]'', which explored street art and commercialism.

==Environmental effects==
[[Spray paint]] has many negative environmental effects. The paint contains toxic chemicals, and the can uses [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s or volatile hydrocarbon gases to spray the paint unto a surface.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} As an alternative, [[moss graffiti]] is starting to catch on,&lt;ref name=envirog/&gt; which uses [[moss]] to create text or images. The moss is glued onto a surface by means of [[beer]], [[buttermilk]], or [[yogurt]] combined with [[sugar]].&lt;ref name=space/&gt;&lt;ref name=hetka/&gt;

== Government responses ==

=== Asia ===
In China, [[Mao Zedong]] in the 1920s used revolutionary slogans and paintings in public places to galvanise the country's communist revolution.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

In Hong Kong, [[Tsang Tsou Choi]] was known as the ''King of Kowloon'' for his [[calligraphy]] graffiti over many years, in which he claimed ownership of the area. Now some of his work is preserved officially.

In [[Taiwan]], the government has made some concessions to graffiti artists. Since 2005 they have been allowed to freely display their work along some sections of riverside retaining walls in designated "Graffiti Zones".&lt;ref name=taitimes/&gt; From 2007, Taipei's department of cultural affairs also began permitting graffiti on fences around major public construction sites. Department head Yong-ping Lee (李永萍) stated, "We will promote graffiti starting with the public sector, and then later in the private sector too. It's our goal to beautify the city with graffiti". The government later helped organize a graffiti contest in [[Ximending]], a popular shopping district. Graffiti artists caught working outside of these designated areas still face fines up to $6,000 TWD under a department of environmental protection regulation.&lt;ref name=taitimes2/&gt; However, Taiwanese authorities can be relatively lenient, one veteran police officer stating anonymously, "Unless someone complains about vandalism, we won't get involved. We don't go after it proactively."&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt;

In 1993, after several expensive cars in [[Singapore]] were spray-painted, the police arrested a student from the [[Singapore American School]], [[Michael P. Fay]], questioned him, and subsequently charged him with vandalism. Fay pleaded guilty to vandalizing a car in addition to stealing road signs. Under the 1966 [[Vandalism Act (Singapore)|Vandalism Act of Singapore]], originally passed to curb the spread of communist graffiti in Singapore, the court sentenced him to four months in jail, a fine of S$3,500 (US$2,233), and a [[caning]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran several editorials and op-eds that condemned the punishment and called on the American public to flood the Singaporean embassy with protests. Although the Singapore government received many calls for [[pardon|clemency]], Fay's caning took place in Singapore on 5 May 1994. Fay had originally received a sentence of six strokes of the cane, but the presiding [[president of Singapore]], [[Ong Teng Cheong]], agreed to reduce his caning sentence to four lashes.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

In [[Republic of Korea|South Korea]], Park Jung-soo was fined 2 million [[South Korean won]] by the [[Seoul]] Central District Court for spray-painting a rat on posters of the [[G-20]] Summit a few days before the event in November 2011. Park alleged that the initial in "G-20" sounds like the Korean word for "rat", but Korean government prosecutors alleged that Mr. Park was making a derogatory statement about the president of ROK, [[Lee Myung-bak]], the host of the summit. This case led to public outcry and debate on the lack of government tolerance and in support of freedom of expression. The court ruled that the painting, "an ominous creature like a rat" amounts to "an organized criminal activity" and upheld the fine while denying the prosecution's request for imprisonment for Park.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

=== Europe ===
[[File:Graffiti removal berlin.jpg|thumb|upright|Graffiti removal in Berlin]]
In Europe, community cleaning squads have responded to graffiti, in some cases with reckless abandon, as when in 1992 in France a local Scout group, attempting to remove modern graffiti, damaged [https://www.panoramio.com/photo/26895452 two prehistoric paintings] of [[bison]] in the [[Cave of Mayrière supérieure]] near the French village of [[Bruniquel]] in [[Tarn-et-Garonne]], earning them the 1992 [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in [[archeology]].&lt;ref name=improb/&gt;

In September 2006, the European Parliament directed the European Commission to create urban environment policies to prevent and eliminate dirt, litter, graffiti, animal excrement, and excessive noise from domestic and vehicular music systems in European cities, along with other concerns over urban life.&lt;ref name=europa/&gt;

The [[Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003]] became Britain's latest anti-graffiti legislation. In August 2004, the [[Keep Britain Tidy]] campaign issued a press release calling for [[zero tolerance]] of graffiti and supporting proposals such as issuing "on the spot" [[Fine (penalty)|fine]]s to graffiti offenders and banning the sale of aerosol paint to anyone under the age of 16.&lt;ref name=encams/&gt; The press release also condemned the use of graffiti images in advertising and in [[music video]]s, arguing that real-world experience of graffiti stood far removed from its often-portrayed 'cool' or 'edgy' image.

To back the campaign, 123 [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s (including then [[Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]]), signed a charter which stated: "Graffiti is not art, it's crime. On behalf of my constituents, I will do all I can to rid our community of this problem."&lt;ref name=wire/&gt; However, since the early 1990s, the British graffiti scene has been struck by self-titled "art terrorist" Banksy, who has revolutionized the style of UK graffiti (bringing to the forefront stencils to aid the speed of painting), as well as the content; making his work largely satirical of the sociological state of cities, or the political climate of war, often using monkeys and rats as motifs.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In the UK, city councils have the power to take action against the owner of any property that has been defaced under the [[Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003]] (as amended by the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2005/ukpga_20050016_en_1 Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005]) or, in certain cases, the Highways Act. This is often used against owners of property that are complacent in allowing protective boards to be defaced so long as the property is not damaged.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In July 2008, a [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] charge was used to convict graffiti artists for the first time. After a three-month police surveillance operation,&lt;ref name=bbc2/&gt; nine members of the DPM crew were convicted of conspiracy to commit [[criminal damage]] costing at least £1 million. Five of them received prison sentences, ranging from eighteen months to two years. The unprecedented scale of the investigation and the severity of the sentences rekindled public debate over whether graffiti should be considered art or crime.&lt;ref name=indep/&gt;

Some councils, like those of Stroud and Loerrach, provide approved areas in the town where graffiti artists can showcase their talents, including underpasses, car parks, and walls that might otherwise prove a target for the 'spray and run.'&lt;ref name=bbc3/&gt;

In [[Budapest]], Hungary both a city-backed movement called ''I Love Budapest'' and a special police division tackle the problem, including the provision of approved areas.&lt;ref name=index/&gt;

=== Australia ===
[[File:Graffiti tunnel 2009, University of Sydney.jpg|thumb|Graffiti Tunnel, University of Sydney at [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]] (2009)]]
In an effort to reduce vandalism, many cities in Australia have designated walls or areas exclusively for use by graffiti artists. One early example is the "Graffiti Tunnel" located at the [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]] Campus of the [[University of Sydney]], which is available for use by any student at the university to tag, advertise, poster, and create "art". Advocates of this idea suggest that this discourages petty vandalism yet encourages artists to take their time and produce great art, without worry of being caught or arrested for vandalism or [[trespassing]].&lt;ref name=warrin/&gt;&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; Others disagree with this approach, arguing that the presence of legal graffiti walls does not demonstrably reduce illegal graffiti elsewhere.&lt;ref name=towno/&gt; Some local government areas throughout Australia have introduced "anti-graffiti squads", who clean graffiti in the area, and such crews as BCW (Buffers Can't Win) have taken steps to keep one step ahead of local graffiti cleaners.

Many state governments have banned the sale or possession of spray paint to those under the age of 18 (age of majority). However, a number of local governments in Victoria have taken steps to recognize the cultural heritage value of some examples of graffiti, such as prominent political graffiti. Tough new graffiti laws have been introduced in Australia with fines of up to A$26,000 and two years in prison.

[[Melbourne]] is a prominent graffiti city of Australia with many of its lanes being tourist attractions, such as [[Hosier Lane, Melbourne|Hosier Lane]] in particular, a popular destination for photographers, wedding photography, and backdrops for corporate print advertising. The [[Lonely Planet]] travel guide cites Melbourne's street as a major attraction. All forms of graffiti, including [[sticker]] art, [[poster]], [[stencil]] art, and [[wheatpasting]], can be found in many places throughout the city. Prominent street art precincts include; [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]], [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], [[Northcote, Victoria|Northcote]], [[Brunswick, Victoria|Brunswick]], [[St Kilda, Victoria|St. Kilda]], and the CBD, where stencil and sticker art is prominent. As one moves farther away from the city, mostly along suburban train lines, graffiti tags become more prominent. Many international artists such as Banksy have left their work in Melbourne and in early 2008 a [[perspex]] screen was installed to prevent a Banksy stencil art piece from being destroyed, it has survived since 2003 through the respect of local street artists avoiding posting over it, although it has recently had paint tipped over it.&lt;ref name=wato/&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
[[File:Christchurch Stock Yards.jpg|thumb|Former Christchurch stock yards]]
In February 2008 [[Helen Clark]], the New Zealand prime minister at that time, announced a government crackdown on tagging and other forms of graffiti vandalism, describing it as a destructive crime representing an invasion of public and private property. New legislation subsequently adopted included a ban on the sale of paint spray cans to persons under 18 and increases in maximum fines for the offence from NZ$200 to NZ$2,000 or extended community service. The issue of tagging become a widely debated one following an incident in [[Auckland]] during January 2008 in which a middle-aged property owner stabbed one of two teenage taggers to death and was subsequently convicted of [[manslaughter]].

====Tracker databases====
Graffiti databases have increased in the past decade because they allow vandalism incidents to be fully documented against an offender and help the police and prosecution charge and prosecute offenders for multiple counts of vandalism. They also provide law enforcement the ability to rapidly search for an offender's moniker or tag in a simple, effective, and comprehensive way. These systems can also help track costs of damage to city to help allocate an anti-graffiti budget. The theory is that when an offender is caught putting up graffiti, they are not just charged with one count of vandalism; they can be held accountable for all of the other damage for which they are responsible. This has two main benefits for law enforcement. One, it sends a signal to the offenders that their vandalism is being tracked. Two, a city can seek restitution from offenders for all of the damage that they have committed, not merely a single incident. These systems give law enforcement personnel real-time, street-level intelligence that allows them to not only focus on the worst graffiti offenders and their damage, but also to monitor potential gang violence that is associated with the graffiti.&lt;ref name=crcp/&gt;

====Gang injunctions====
Many restrictions of civil gang injunctions are designed to help address and protect the physical environment and limit graffiti. Provisions of gang injunctions include things such as restricting the possession of marker pens, spray paint cans, or other sharp objects capable of defacing private or public property; spray painting, or marking with marker pens, scratching, applying stickers, or otherwise applying graffiti on any public or private property, including, but not limited to the street, alley, residences, block walls, and fences, vehicles and/or any other real or personal property. Some injunctions contain wording that restricts damaging or vandalizing the property of another, both public and private property, including, but limited to any vehicle, light fixture, door, fence, wall, gate, window, building, street sign, utility box, telephone box, trees, or power pole.&lt;ref name=crcp2 /&gt;

====Hotlines and reward programs====
To help address many of these issues, many local jurisdictions have set up graffiti abatement hotlines, where citizens can call in and report vandalism and have it removed. San Diego's hotline receives more than 5,000 calls per year, in addition to reporting the graffiti, callers can learn more about prevention. One of the complaints about these hotlines is the response time; there is often a lag time between a property owner calling about the graffiti and its removal. The length of delay should be a consideration for any jurisdiction planning on operating a hotline. Local jurisdictions must convince the callers that their complaint of vandalism will be a priority and cleaned off right away. If the jurisdiction does not have the resources to respond to complaints in a timely manner, the value of the hotline diminishes. Crews must be able to respond to individual service calls made to the graffiti hotline as well as focus on cleanup near schools, parks, and major intersections and transit routes to have the biggest impact. Some cities offer a reward for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of suspects for tagging or graffiti related vandalism. The amount of the reward is based on the information provided, and the action taken.&lt;ref name=lawtec/&gt;

====Search warrants====
When the police use search warrants in connection with a vandalism investigation they are often seeking judicial approval to look for items such as cans of spray paint and nozzles from other kinds of aerosol sprays, etching tools, or other sharp or pointed objects used to etch or scratch glass and other hard surfaces, such as permanent marking pens and markers or paint sticks; evidence of membership or affiliation with any gang or tagging crew, paraphernalia to include any reference to "(tagger's name)," and any drawings, writings, objects, or graffiti depicting taggers' names, initials, logos, monikers, slogans, or mention of tagging crew membership; any newspaper clippings relating details of or referring to any graffiti crime.&lt;ref name=paladin/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Haboku'''''|破墨|}} and {{nihongo|'''''Hatsuboku'''''|溌墨|}} are both a technique employed in ''[[suiboku]]'' (ink based), as seen in landscape paintings, involving an abstract simplification of forms and freedom of brushwork. The two terms are often confused with each other in ordinary use. Generally, ''haboku'' relies on a layered contrast black, gray and white, whereas ''hatsuboku'' utilizes "splashes" of ink, without leaving clear contours or outlines.&lt;ref name="haboku"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0804832609&amp;id=vROF2UAiLRUC&amp;pg=PA63|page=63|title=Japanese Ink-Painting: Lessons in Suiboku Techniques |author=Ryūkyū Saitō|isbn=0804832609}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, these styles of painting were firmly founded and spread by the Japanese painter [[Sesshū Tōyō]].

'''''Heimkommen''''' (Homecoming) and the related [[hashtag]] '''#heimkommen''' is a German commercial video for the supermarket corporation [[Edeka]] that [[viral video|went viral]] in November and December 2015.

In the commercial, [[Arthur Nightingale]] plays a German grandfather faking his own death to reunite his family on Christmas.&lt;ref name="Tagesspiegel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Welt" /&gt;

== Video ==
The 1:46-minute commercial shows a well-to-do grandfather receiving messages over the years from his successful children around the world, who call off family get-togethers at Christmas time. Each year he eats his Christmas dinner by himself. Eventually he fakes his own death, and his grieving children and grandchildren travel to his home, only to find him still alive. He tells them, "I had no other way to bring you together". After the family unites in a joyful Christmas dinner, the final shot shows the Edeka logo.&lt;ref name=clip/&gt;

[[File:Wilcox.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] (1863–1935)]]

An '''illustration''' is a decoration, interpretation or visual explanation of a text, concept or process,&lt;ref&gt;cf. the freely available international [http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/hi/gnt/dsi Database of Scientific Illustrators 1450-1950] with 20 search fields and nearly 7000 entries of illustrators in science, medicine &amp; technology active prior to 1950&lt;/ref&gt; designed for integration in published media, such as posters, flyers, magazines, books, teaching materials, animations, video games and films.

The origin of the word “illustration” is late Middle English (in the sense ‘illumination; spiritual or intellectual enlightenment’): via Old French from Latin ''illustratio(n- )'', from the verb ''illustrate''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/illustration|title=Oxford Dictionary|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 02.png|thumb|right|The [[White Rabbit]] from [[Alice in Wonderland]], illustrated by [[John Tenniel]] (1820–1914) ]]

Contemporary illustration uses a wide range of styles and techniques, including [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[printmaking]], [[collage]], [[Photomontage|montage]], [[digital design]], [[multimedia]], [[3D modelling]]. Most illustrators work on a freelance basis. 

Depending on the purpose, illustration may be expressive, stylised, realistic or highly technical.

[[Technical illustration|Technical]] and [[scientific illustration]] communicates information of a technical or scientific nature. This may include [[Exploded-view drawing|exploded view]]s, [[Cutaway drawing|cutaways]], fly-throughs, reconstructions, instructional images, component designs, [[diagrams]]. The aim is "to generate expressive images that effectively convey certain information via the visual channel to the human observer"&lt;ref name="ViGr05"&gt;Ivan Viola and Meister E. Gröller (2005).

In: ''Computational Aesthetics in Graphics, Visualization and Imaging''. L. Neumann et al. (Ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical and scientific illustration is generally designed to describe or explain subjects to a nontechnical audience, so must provide "an overall impression of what an object is or does, to enhance the viewer's interest and understanding".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.industriegrafik.com/TIE1.htm Industriegrafik.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814125052/http://www.industriegrafik.com/TIE1.htm |date=2009-08-14 }} website, Last modified: June 15, 2002. Accessed february 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary illustration practice, 2D and 3D software is often used to create accurate representations that can be updated easily, and reused in a variety of contexts.

== Illustration as fine art ==
[[File:Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing. William Blake. c.1786.jpg|thumb|''Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing'' by [[William Blake]] (1786) ]]

In the art world, illustration has at times been considered of less importance than [[graphic design]] and fine art.

Today, however, due in part to the growth of [[graphic novel]] and [[video game]] industries, as well as increased use of illustration in magazines and other publications, illustration is now becoming a valued art form, capable of engaging a global market.

Original illustration art has been known to attract high prices at auction. The US artist [[Norman Rockwell]]'s painting "Breaking Home Ties" sold in a 2006 [[Sotheby's]] auction for USD15.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyfinance.com/story/media/norman-rockwell-art-rises-in-value-and-his-museum-gets-priced-o/19366251/ Norman Rockwell's Rising Value Prices Out His Museum] Zac Bissonnette, AOL Daily Finance, 2-22-10&lt;/ref&gt; Many other illustration genres are equally valued, with pinup artists such as [[Gil Elvgren]] and [[Alberto Vargas]], for example, also attracting high prices.

[[File:Fire-setting.jpg|thumb|An engraving by [[Georgius Agricola]] or [[Georgius Agricola|Georg Bauer]] (1494–1555), illustrating the mining practice of [[fire-setting]] ]]

Historically, the art of illustration is closely linked to the industrial processes of [[printing]] and [[publishing]].

=== Early history ===

The illustrations of medieval [[codices]] were known as [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminations]], and were individually hand drawn and painted. With the invention of the [[printing press]] during the 15th century, [[books]] became more widely distributed, often illustrated with [[woodcuts]].

1600s Japan saw the origination of [[Ukiyo-e]], an influential illustration style characterised by expressive line, vivid colour and subtle tones, resulting from the ink-brushed [[woodblock printing in Japan|wood block printing]] technique. Subjects included traditional folk tales, popular figures and every day life. [[Hokusai]]’s ''The Great Wave of Kanazawa'' is a famous image of the time.

During the 16th and 17th centuries in Europe, the main reproduction processes for illustration were [[engraving]] and [[etching]]. In 18th Century England, a notable illustrator was [[William Blake]] (1757–827), who used [[relief etching]]. By the early 19th century, the introduction of [[lithography]] substantially improved reproduction quality.

=== 19th Century ===

In Europe, notable figures of the early 19th Century were [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], [[George Cruikshank]], [[Dickens]] illustrator [[Hablot Knight Browne]], and, in France, [[Honoré Daumier]]. All contributed to both satirical and “serious” publications. At this time, there was a great demand for [[caricature]] drawings encapsulating social mores, types and classes.

The British humorous magazine [[Punch (magazine)|Punch]] (1841–2002) built on the success of Cruikshank's [[Comic Almanac]] (1827–1840) and employed many well-regarded illustrators, including Sir [[John Tenniel]], the [[Dalziel Brothers]], and [[George du Maurier|Georges du Maurier]]. Although all fine art trained, their reputations were gained primarily as illustrators.

Historically, Punch was most influential in the 1840s and 1850s. The magazine was the first to use the term "[[cartoon]]" to describe a humorous illustration and its widespread use led to [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]] being known as the world's first "[[cartoonist]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Punch Magazine Changed Everything|url=http://illustrationchronicles.com/How-Punch-Magazine-Changed-Everything|website=Illustration Chronicles|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In common with similar magazines such as the Parisian [[Le Voleur]], Punch realised good illustration sold as well as good text. With publication continuing into the 21st Century, Punch chronicles a gradual shift in popular illustration, from reliance on caricature to sophisticated topical observation.

=== The "Golden Age" ===

From the early 1800s [[newspaper]]s, mass market [[magazine]]s, and illustrated books had become the dominant consumer media in Europe and the New World. By the 19th century, improvements in printing technology freed illustrators to experiment with color and rendering techniques. These developments in printing effected all areas of literature from cookbooks, photography and traveling guides, as well as children's books. Also, due to advances in printing, it became more affordable to produce color photographs within books and other materials. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Books: A Living History|last=Lyons|first=Martyn|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=2011|isbn=9780500291153|location=London|pages=193-196}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900, almost 100 percent of paper was machine-made, and while a person working by hand could produce 60-100lbs of paper per day, mechanization yielded around 1,000lbs per day.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Broadview Anthology of Victorian Prose: 1832- 1901|last=Leighton|first=Mary Elizabeth|last2=Surridge|first2=Lisa|publisher=Broadview Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Peterborough, ON|pages=14|chapter=Victorian Print Media and the Reading Public}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in the 50 year period between 1846 and 1916, book production increased 400% and the price of books was cut in half.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In [[America]], this led to a "golden age of illustration" from before the 1880s until the early 20th century. A small group of illustrators became highly successful, with the imagery they created considered a portrait of American aspirations of the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rafoxsociety.com/what-was-the-golden-age-of-illustration/ The R. Atkinson Fox Society: What Was the Golden Age of Illustration?]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the best known illustrators of that period were [[N. C. Wyeth|N.C. Wyeth]] and [[Howard Pyle]] of the [[Brandywine School]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], and [[James Montgomery Flagg]].

The '''''Jabach Altarpiece''''' is an [[oil painting|oil]] on lime tree panel painting by German Renaissance artist [[Albrecht Dürer]], executed around 1503–1504. Originally a [[triptych]], only the side panels are now preserved: the right picture, measuring 96×54&amp;nbsp;cm, is housed in the [[Wallraf-Richartz Museum]] of [[Cologne]]; the left picture, measuring 96×51&amp;nbsp;cm, is housed in the [[Städel]] of [[Frankfurt]].

==History==
The altarpiece was probably commissioned by [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]], for a chapel in his castle at [[Wittenberg]], perhaps in occasion of the end of the plague in 1503.

The reconstruction of the work is disputed. Some art historians identify the central panel with the [[Uffizi]] [[Adoration of the Magi (Dürer)|''Adoration of the Magi'']], while according to others there was instead a group of sculptures.&lt;ref name = "Porcu"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Costantino Porcu |title=Dürer|publisher=Rizzoli|location=Milan|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Apostles'' on gilded background now at the [[Alte Pinakothek]] of Munich have also been associated with the [[polyptych]]: in this view, the two known paintings would form a single image on the external shutters once closed; in fact, the two share a common background, and the dress of Job's wife continues to the right panel as well.&lt;ref name = "Porcu"/&gt;

It is named after one of its owners, [[Everhard Jabach]], in whose family chapel it was still hanging in the late 18th century, before being split up and scattered to different locations.

==Description==

The left panel depicts the prophet [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] seated, with a desperate expression on his face, after [[Satan]] has defied him to keep his allegiance to God even in the most tremendous afflictions. These include his flock getting scattered in the other panel, while his properties are on fire at the left edge. Further, his skin is covered by blisters, an appropriate element for a painting likely originated as an [[ex-voto]] for the end of plague. His wife, dressed in Renaissance garments, is pouring dirty water above him, while a small devil flees in the far background.&lt;ref name="Porcu"/&gt;

The right panel shows two standing musicians. The right one, with the drum, is perhaps a self-portrait. Their meaning has not been explained: they could be a further element of mockery against Job, or, instead, an attempt to console him through music.&lt;ref name="Porcu"/&gt;

'''''Janus''''' was a [[feminism|feminist]] [[science fiction]] [[science fiction fanzine|fanzine]] edited by [[Janice Bogstad]] and [[Jeanne Gomoll]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], and closely associated with that city's [[science fiction convention]], [[WisCon]] (Several early WisCon [[program book]]s doubled as special issues of ''Janus''.)&lt;ref&gt;"What is WisCon?:History of Wiscon"&lt;/ref&gt; It was repeatedly nominated for the [[Hugo Award for Best Fanzine]] (1978, 1979 and 1980);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/HugoNomList.html Hugo Nominee List] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920202744/http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/HugoNomList.html |date=2011-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this led to accusations that if ''Janus'' had not been feminist, it wouldn't have been nominated.&lt;ref&gt;Merrick, Helen.

The '''Jewish view on birth control''' currently varies between the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] branches of Judaism. Among Orthodox Judaism, use of birth control has been considered only acceptable for use in limited circumstances. Conservative Judaism, while generally encouraging its members to follow the traditional Jewish views on birth control has been more willing to allow greater exceptions regarding its use to fit better within modern society. Reform Judaism has generally been the most liberal with regard to birth control allowing individual followers to use their own judgment in what, if any, birth control methods they might wish to employ.

Regulations regarding contraception affect the traditional streams of Judaism (including the [[Haredi]] and [[Modern Orthodox]] varieties) more so than others because of their strict adherence to Halakhah, or Jewish law.  These regulations affect liberal strains of Judaism (including the Reform, Reconstructionist, and Conservative movements; particularly in Western society) much less, where the emphasis is on applying [[Halakhah]] to modern life rather than observing it strictly.  Many modern Jews feel that the benefits of contraception, be they female health, family stability, or disease prevention, uphold the commandment in Judaism to "choose life" much more strongly than they violate the commandment to "[[Cultural mandate|be fruitful and multiply]]".

==Orthodox Judaism==
Among traditional interpretations of the [[Torah]], active prevention of pregnancy is in violation of the commandment "be fruitful and multiply" ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|1:28|HE}}). Some [[Rabbi|Rabbinic authorities]]{{who|date=November 2012}} further consider the possibility (generally not accepted) that a union that by definition cannot lead to pregnancy would amount to "spilling seed", the sin of [[Onan]] ( {{bibleverse||Genesis|38:9-10|HE}}).  A woman’s obligation being overridden in Jewish law by the danger of childbirth which opens up the option of them taking steps toward preventing pregnancy.

The option of contraception is raised by the [[Talmud]] ([http://www.come-and-hear.com/yebamoth/yebamoth_12.html#PARTb tractate Yevamot 12b]), where the use of a [[Pessary#Occlusive pessaries|pessary]] is discussed for women who are too young to get pregnant, presently pregnant, or nursing. In each case, either the woman or her child is at risk for serious complications, and this is the basis for many [[rabbinic literature|rabbinic authorities]] permitting contraception in situations where pregnancy would seriously harm the woman. In those cases, the most "natural" method is preferred; as the use of a condom or pessary creates a physical barrier, "[[combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]]" (or an [[intrauterine device]]) is preferred by most authorities. [[Fertility awareness]] methods (modern improvements over the [[calendar-based methods|rhythm method]]) are difficult to use, because many infertile days coincide with the ritually impure days of [[niddah]].

Orthodox rabbis believe that the positive commandment of being fruitful and multiplying is a male obligation. Consequently, wives may choose abstinence as birth control, but husbands are not permitted to decline their wives if they are not in niddah.

Contraceptive measures that lead to male sterility, are not ever permitted for their interfering with a man's obligation, only ever being permitted in life-threatening circumstances for the man such as some forms of cancer.  For example, a crushed or mangled man may not be permitted to marry anyone but a convert under Jewish law, and halachic authorities see [[vasectomy]] as a form of maiming, even if already married to a non-convert becoming maimed intentionally or accidentally including an vasectomy does obligate divorce unless a successful repair surgery is performed and sperm flow is returned (based on [[Deuteronomy]] {{bibleverse-nb||Deuteronomy|23:2|HE}}).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aish.com/atr/Vasectomy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

When Orthodox Jewish couples contemplate the use of contraceptives, they generally consult a [[rabbi]] competent on this topic who evaluates the need for the intervention and which method is preferable from a ''[[halakha|halachic]]'' point of view.

The Midrash of Genesis speaks of the origins of oral contraceptives: "In the early time of creation, in the time of Lemech, a medicine was known, the taking of which prevented a woman's conception."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/mhl/mhl05.htm Genesis Rabba 23 p.56]&lt;/ref&gt;

Inasmuch as the strict letter of the law, as understood by classic authorities, does not obligate the fathering of limitless number of children beyond the requirement to produce at least one child of each gender or according to another opinion until two male offspring are born, there is wide latitude within halacha to limit family sizes, although usage of contraception varies from community to community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Contraception.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Modern Orthodox authorities are inclined to permit contraception for a broad array of reasons, with some arguing that a couple may decide to delay procreation even without specific rabbinic permission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yctorah.org/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_view/gid,1398/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hormonal contraception==
Generally, the introduction of [[hormonal contraception]] in the 1960s did not cause the stir within [[Judaism|Jewish]] circles that it caused in other religious groups. A number of [[responsa]] from rabbinic decisors (''[[posek|poskim]]'') outlined the proper approach to the new phenomenon.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} There has been little talk of the potential risk of increased [[promiscuity]] (''z'nut'').{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

An innovative use of the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] in Judaism is employed by some young brides. The laws of [[family purity]] prohibit sexual intercourse while a woman is menstruating (see ''[[niddah]]''). In order to decrease the chance of [[menstruation]] occurring just before (or on) the wedding night, some brides briefly regulate their periods in the months leading up to their [[wedding]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

'''Kay Smith''' is a historical artist, who specializes in using watercolors and depicting landscapes.

==Early life==
Smith grew up in [[Vandalia, Illinois]] and was the fourth of six children.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune1"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-03-01/news/ct-met-schmich-0301-20130301_1_birthday-party-last-call-kay-smith |title=At 90, artist Kay Smith follows her straight road|work=Chicago Tribune |date=2013-03-01 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

During [[World War II]], she moved to Chicago and attended classes at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref name="chicagotribune1"/&gt;  She worked as a commercial illustrator until the 1970s, when she turned to historical subjects.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune2005"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-04-17/features/0504170375_1_artist-laureate-art-and-history-art-institute |title=Art of the state|work=Chicago Tribune |date=2005-04-17 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She visited historical sites to depict them accurately and raise awareness about these sites importance to the national heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Edgell, page 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tale==
[[File:Little Red Riding Hood - Project Gutenberg etext 19993.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Little Red Riding Hood'', illustrated in a 1927 story anthology]]

The story revolves around a girl called Little Red Riding Hood. In [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Grimms']] and [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]]'s versions of the tale, she is named after her magical red [[hood (headgear)|hood]]ed [[cape]]/[[cloak]] that she wears. The girl walks through the woods to deliver food to her sickly grandmother (wine and cake depending on the translation). In the Grimms' version, her mother had ordered her to stay strictly on the path.

A Big Bad Wolf wants to eat the girl and the food in the basket. He secretly stalks her behind trees, bushes, shrubs, and patches of little and tall grass. He approaches Little Red Riding Hood, who naively tells him where she is going. He suggests the girl to pick some flowers, which she does. In the meantime, he goes to the grandmother's house and gains entry by pretending to be the girl. He swallows the grandmother wholly (in some stories, he locks her in the closet) and waits for the girl, disguised as the grandma.

[[File:GustaveDore She was astonished to see how her grandmother looked.jpg|thumb|[[Gustave Doré]]'s engraving of the scene: "She was astonished to see how her grandmother looked"]]

When the girl arrives, she notices that her grandmother looks very strange. Little Red then says, "What a deep voice you have!" ("The better to greet you with", responds the wolf), "Goodness, what big eyes you have!" ("The better to see you with", responds the wolf), "And what big hands you have!" ("The better to hug/grab you with", responds the wolf), and lastly, "What a big mouth you have" ("The better to eat you with!", responds the wolf), at which point the wolf jumps out of bed and eats her up too. Then he falls asleep. In Charles Perrault's version of the story (the first version to be published), the tale ends here. However, in later versions, the story continues generally as follows:

A [[lumberjack|woodcutter]] in the French version, but a [[Hunting|hunter]] in the Brothers Grimm and traditional German versions, comes to the rescue and with an axe, and cuts open the sleeping wolf. Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother emerge unharmed. Then they fill the wolf's body with heavy stones. The wolf awakens and attempts to flee, but the stones cause him to collapse and die. Sanitized versions of the story have the grandmother locked in the closet instead of being eaten and some have Little Red Riding Hood saved by the lumberjack as the wolf advances on her rather than after she gets eaten, where the woodcutter kills the wolf with his axe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spurgeon|first=Maureen|title=Red Riding Hood|year=1990|publisher=Brown Watson|location=England|isbn=0709706928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale makes the clearest contrast between the safe world of the village and the dangers of the [[enchanted forest|forest]], conventional [[Antithesis|antitheses]] that are essentially medieval, though no written versions are as old as that.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} It also warns about the dangers of not obeying one's mother (at least in the Grimms' version).{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Tale's history==
===Relationship to other tales===

The story displays many similarities to stories from classical Greece and Rome. Scholar Graham Anderson has compared the story to a local legend recounted by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in which, each year, a virgin girl was offered to a malevolent spirit dressed in the skin of a wolf, who raped the girl. Then, one year, the boxer Euthymos came along, slew the spirit, and married the girl who had been offered up as a sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the Ancient World |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|page= 94|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=Fairytale+in+the+ancient+world|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a number of different stories recounted by Greek authors involving a woman named Pyrrha (literally "Fire") and a man with some name meaning "wolf".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the Ancient World |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|pages =94–95|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=Fairytale+in+the+ancient+world|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman poet [[Horace]] alludes to a tale in which a male child is rescued alive from the belly of [[Lamia]], a female [[ogre]]ss in classical mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the Ancient World |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|pages =96–97|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=Fairytale+in+the+ancient+world|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dialogue between the Big Bad Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood has its analogies to the Norse ''[[Þrymskviða]]'' from the ''[[Elder Edda]]''; the giant [[Þrymr]] had stolen [[Mjölner]], [[Thor]]'s hammer, and demanded [[Freyja]] as his bride for its return. Instead, the gods dressed Thor as a bride and sent him. When the giants note Thor's unladylike eyes, eating, and drinking, [[Loki]] explains them as Freyja's not having slept, or eaten, or drunk, out of longing for the wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=[[Iona and Peter Opie|Opie, Iona &amp; Peter]]|title=The Classic Fairy Tales|pages= 93–4|isbn= 0-19-211559-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A parallel to another Norse myth, the chase and eventual murder of the [[Sól (sun)|sun goddess]] by the wolf [[Sköll]], has also been drawn.&lt;ref&gt;Dundes, Alan &amp; McGlathery, James M. (ed.). "Intrepreting Little Red Riding Hood Psychoanalytically". The Brothers Grimm and Folktale. pp. 26–7. {{ISBN|0-252-01549-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A very similar story also belongs to the North African tradition, namely in [[Kabylia]], where a number of versions are attested.&lt;ref&gt;The oldest source is the tale ''Rova'' in: [[Leo Frobenius]], ''Volksmärchen und Volksdichtungen Afrikas'' / Band III, Jena 1921: 126-129, fairy tale # 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of the little girl who visits her (grand-)dad in his cabin and is recognized by the sound of her bracelets constitutes the refrain of a well-known song by the modern singer [[Idir]], ''[[A Vava Inouva]]'':
{|
|
:
:‘I beseech you, open the door for me, father.
:Jingle your bracelets, oh my daughter Ghriba.
:I’m afraid of the monster in the forest, father.
:I, too, am afraid, oh my daughter Ghriba.’&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from: Jane E. Goodman, ''Berber Culture on the World Stage: From Village to Video'', Indiana University Press, 2005: 62.&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

The theme of the ravening wolf and of the creature released unharmed from its [[stomach|belly]] is also reflected in the Russian tale ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]''{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} and another Grimm tale ''[[The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids]]'',{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} but its general theme of restoration is at least as old as the biblical story, ''[[Book of Jonah|Jonah and the Whale]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The theme also appears in the story of the life of [[Margaret the Virgin|Saint Margaret]], wherein the saint emerges unharmed from the belly of a [[dragon]],{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} and in the epic "The Red Path" by [[Jim C. Hines]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

A Taiwanese story from the 16th Century, known as Grandaunt Tiger bears several striking similarities. When the girl's mother goes out, the tiger comes to the girl's house and pretends to be their aunt, asking to come in. The girl says that her voice does not sound right, so the tiger attempts to disguise her voice. Then, the girl says that her hands feel too coarse, so the tiger attempts to make them smoother. When finally, the tiger gains entry, she eats the girl's sister's hand. The girl comes up with a ruse to go outside and fetch some food for her aunt. Grandaunt Tiger, suspicious of the girl, ties a rope to her leg. The girl ties a bucket to the rope to fool her, but Grandaunt Tiger realises this and chases after her, whereupon she climbs into a tree. The girl tells the tiger that she will let her eat her, but first she would like to feed her some fruit from the tree. The tiger comes closer to eat the food, whereupon, the girl pours boiling hot oil down her throat, killing her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lontzen |first1=Dr Guntzen |title=The Earliest Version of the Chinese Red Riding Hood |jstor=41390379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earliest versions===
[[File:Walter Crane26.jpg|thumb|upright|"The better to see you with": woodcut by [[Walter Crane]]]]

The origins of the Little Red Riding Hood story can be traced to versions from various European countries and more than likely preceding the 17th century, of which several exist, some significantly different from the currently known, Grimms-inspired version. It was told by [[France|French]] peasants in the 10th century&lt;ref name="Jacques Berlioz 2007 p63"/&gt; and recorded by the cathedral schoolmaster Egbert of Liege.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Ziolkowski, "A fairy tale from before fairy tales: Egbert of Liege's ‘De puella a lupellis seruata’ and the medieval background of ‘Little Red Riding Hood’", ''Speculum'' 67 (1992): 549–575.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Italy]], the Little Red Riding Hood was told by peasants in the fourteenth century, where a number of versions exist, including ''La finta nonna'' (The False Grandmother), written among others by [[Italo Calvino]] in the ''[[Italian Folktales]]'' collection.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, In Hungarian folklore, the story is known as "Piroska" (Little Red), is still told in mostly the original version described above. ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 744, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been called "The Story of Grandmother". It is also possible that this early tale has roots in very similar East Asian tales (e.g. "Grandaunt Tiger").&lt;ref&gt;Alan Dundes, ''little ducking''&lt;/ref&gt;

These early variations of the tale, do differ from the currently known version in several ways. The antagonist is not always a wolf, but sometimes an [[ogre]], [[vampire]],&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, S. L. (2008). Little Red Riding Hood. In D. Haase, The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairytales: G-P (pp. 466-492). Greenwood Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt; or a 'bzou' ([[werewolf]]), making these tales relevant to the werewolf-trials (similar to witch trials) of the time (e.g. the trial of [[Peter Stumpp]]).&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Orenstein, ''Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked: Sex, Morality and the Evolution of a Fairy Tale'', pp 92-106, {{ISBN|0-465-04126-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wolf usually leaves the grandmother's blood and meat for the girl to eat, who then unwittingly [[cannibal]]izes her own grandmother. Furthermore, the wolf was also known to ask her to remove her clothing and toss it into the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zipes|first=Jack|title=The Trials and Tribulations of Little Red Riding Hood|year=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-90835-3|edition=2nd|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some versions, the wolf eats the girl after she gets into bed with him, and the story ends there.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last=Darnton|first=Robert|title=The Great Cat Massacre and Other Episodes in French Cultural History|year=1985|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0-394-72927-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In others, she sees through his disguise and tries to escape, complaining to her "grandmother" that she needs to defecate and would not wish to do so in the bed. The wolf reluctantly lets her go, tied to a piece of string so she does not get away. However, the girl slips the string over something else and runs off. In these stories she escapes with no help from any male or older female figure, instead using her own cunning, or in some versions the help of a younger boy who she happens to run into.&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, S. L. (2008). Little Red Riding Hood. In D. Haase, The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairytales: G-P (pp. 522-534). Greenwood Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, though more rarely, the red hood is even non-existent.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In other tellings of the story, the wolf chases after Little Red Riding Hood. She escapes with the help of some laundresses, who spread a sheet taut over a river so she may escape. When the wolf follows Red over the bridge of cloth, the sheet is released and the wolf drowns in the river.&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, S. L. (2008). Little Red Riding Hood. In D. Haase, The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairytales: G-P (pp. 583-588). Greenwood Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt; And in another version the wolf is pushed into the fire, while he is preparing the meat of the grandmother to be eaten by the girl.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Charles Perrault===
The earliest known printed version&lt;ref&gt;Iona and Peter Opie, ''The Classic Fairy Tales''. p. 93. {{ISBN|0-19-211559-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; was known as ''Le Petit [[Chaperon (headgear)|Chaperon]] Rouge'' and may have had its origins in 17th-century French [[folklore]]. It was included in the collection ''[[Histoires ou contes du temps passé|Tales and Stories of the Past with Morals. Tales of Mother Goose]]'' (''Histoires et contes du temps passé, avec des moralités. Contes de ma mère l'Oye''), in 1697, by [[Charles Perrault]]. As the title implies, this version&lt;ref&gt;Charles Perrault, "[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0333.html Le Petit Chaperon Rouge]"&lt;/ref&gt; is both more sinister and more overtly moralized than the later ones. The redness of the hood, which has been given symbolic significance in many interpretations of the tale, was a detail introduced by Perrault.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, p 17, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Little Red Riding Hood.jpg|thumb|left|French images,like this 19th-century painting, show the much shorter red [[chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]] being worn]]

The story had as its subject an "attractive, well-bred young lady", a village girl of the country being deceived into giving a wolf she encountered the information he needed to find her grandmother's house successfully and eat the old woman while at the same time avoiding being noticed by woodcutters working in the nearby forest. Then he proceeded to lay a trap for the Red Riding Hood. Little Red Riding Hood ends up being asked to climb into the bed before being eaten by the wolf, where the story ends. The wolf emerges the victor of the encounter and there is no happy ending.

Charles Perrault explained the 'moral' at the end of the tale:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/perrault02.html |title=Little Red Riding Hood Charles Perrault |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=21 September 2003 |website=Pitt.Edu |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |access-date=12 January 2016|quote=And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that no doubt is left to his intended meaning:

{{quote|From this story one learns that children, especially young lasses, pretty, courteous and well-bred, do very wrong to listen to strangers, And it is not an unheard thing if the Wolf is thereby provided with his dinner. I say Wolf, for all wolves are not of the same sort; there is [[Rake (character)|one kind]] with an amenable disposition – neither noisy, nor hateful, nor angry, but tame, obliging and gentle, following the young maids in the streets, even into their homes. Alas! Who does not know that these gentle wolves are of all such creatures the most dangerous!}}

This, the presumed original, version of the tale was written for late seventeenth-century French court of [[King Louis XIV]]. This audience, whom the King entertained with extravagant parties, presumably would take from the story the intended meaning.

===The Brothers Grimm===
[[File:Grimm.jpg|thumb|Wilhelm (left) and Jacob Grimm, from an 1855 painting by [[Elisabeth Jerichau-Baumann]]]]

In the 19th century two separate German versions were retold to [[Jacob Grimm]] and his younger brother [[Wilhelm Grimm]], known as the [[Brothers Grimm]], the first by Jeanette Hassenpflug (1791–1860) and the second by Marie Hassenpflug (1788–1856). The brothers turned the first version to the main body of the story and the second into a sequel of it. The story as ''Rotkäppchen'' was included in the first edition of their collection ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Kinder- und Hausmärchen]]'' (Children's and Household Tales (1812)).&lt;ref&gt;Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, "[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0333.html#grimm Little Red Cap]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The earlier parts of the tale agree so closely with Perrault's variant that it is almost certainly the source of the tale.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Velten, "The Influences of Charles Perrault's ''Contes de ma Mère L'oie'' on German Folklore", p 966, Jack Zipes, ed. ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they modified the ending; this version had the little girl and her grandmother saved by a huntsman who was after the wolf's skin; this ending is identical to that in the tale "[[The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids]]", which appears to be the source.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Velten, "The Influences of Charles Perrault's ''Contes de ma Mère L'oie'' on German Folklore", p 967, Jack Zipes, ed. ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second part featured the girl and her grandmother trapping and killing another wolf, this time anticipating his moves based on their experience with the previous one. The girl did not leave the path when the wolf spoke to her, her grandmother locked the door to keep it out, and when the wolf lurked, the grandmother had Little Red Riding Hood put a trough under the chimney and fill it with water that sausages had been cooked in; the smell lured the wolf down, and it drowned.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p 149 W. W. Norton &amp; company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brothers further revised the story in later editions and it reached the above-mentioned final and better-known version in the 1857 edition of their work.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, "[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm026.html Little Red Cap]"&lt;/ref&gt; It is notably tamer than the older stories which contained darker themes.

===After the Grimms===
[[File:Little Red Riding Hood and the Wolf (1858).jpg|thumb|left| An engraving from the ''Cyclopedia of Wit and Humor''.]]

Numerous authors have rewritten or adapted this tale.

[[Andrew Lang]] included a variant called "The True History of Little Goldenhood"&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lang, "[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/ridinghood/stories/golden.html The True History of Little Goldenhood]", ''The Red Fairy Book'' (1890)&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[The Red Fairy Book]]'' (1890). He derived it from the works of Charles Marelles,&lt;ref&gt;The proper name of this French author is ''Charles Marelle'' (1827-19..), there is a typo in Andrew Lang's ''Red Fairy Book''. See [http://data.bnf.fr/12364021/charles_marelle/ BNF note online].&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Contes of Charles Marelles''. This version explicitly states that the story had been mistold earlier. The girl is saved, but not by the huntsman; when the wolf tries to eat her, its mouth is burned by the golden hood she wears, which is enchanted.

[[James Nelson Barker|James N. Barker]] wrote a variation of Little Red Riding Hood in 1827 as an approximately 1000-word story. It was later reprinted in 1858 in a book of collected stories edited by William E Burton, called the ''Cyclopedia of Wit and Humor''. The reprint also features a wood engraving of a clothed wolf on bended knee holding Little Red Riding Hood's hand.

In the 20th century, the popularity of the tale appeared to snowball, with many new versions being written and produced, especially in the wake of Freudian analysis, [[deconstruction]] and [[feminist literary criticism|feminist critical theory]]. (See [[#Modern uses and adaptations|"Modern uses and adaptations" below]].) This trend has also led to a number of academic texts being written that focus on Little Red Riding Hood, including works by [[Alan Dundes]] and [[Jack Zipes]].

==Interpretations==
[[File:Dore ridinghood.jpg|thumb|upright|A depiction by [[Gustave Doré]], 1883.]]

Besides the overt warning about talking to strangers, there are many interpretations of the classic fairy tale, many of them sexual.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Yolen, ''Touch Magic'' p 25, {{ISBN|0-87483-591-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some are listed below.

===Natural cycles===
[[folkloristics|Folklorists]] and [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]], such as [[P. Saintyves]] and [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], saw "Little Red Riding Hood" in terms of solar myths and other naturally occurring cycles. Her red hood could represent the bright sun which is ultimately swallowed by the terrible night (the wolf), and the variations in which she is cut out of the wolf's belly represent the dawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tatar, Maria |page= 25|title=The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales|isbn= 0-393-05163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this interpretation, there is a connection between the wolf of this tale and [[Sköll]], the wolf in Norse mythology that will swallow [[Sól (sun)|the personified Sun]] at [[Ragnarök]], or [[Fenrir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dundes, Alan &amp; McGlathery, James M. (ed.) |title=Intrepreting Little Red Riding Hood Psychoanalytically|pages= 26–7|work=The Brothers Grimm and Folktale|isbn=0-252-01549-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the tale could be about the season of spring or the month of May, escaping the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dundes, Alan &amp; McGlathery, James M.

===Rite===
The tale has been interpreted as a [[puberty]] rite, stemming from a prehistoric origin (sometimes an origin stemming from a previous matriarchal era).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dundes, Alan &amp; McGlathery, James M. (ed.) |title=Intrepreting Little Red Riding Hood Psychoanalytically|pages= 27–9|work=The Brothers Grimm and Folktale|isbn=0-252-01549-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The girl, leaving home, enters a [[Liminality|liminal]] state and by going through the acts of the tale, is transformed into an adult woman by the act of coming out of the wolf's stomach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dundes, Alan &amp; McGlathery, James M. (ed.) |title=Intrepreting Little Red Riding Hood Psychoanalytically|pages= 27–8|work=The Brothers Grimm and Folktale|isbn=0-252-01549-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebirth===
[[Bruno Bettelheim]], in ''[[The Uses of Enchantment]]: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales'' (1976), recast the Little Red Riding Hood motif in terms of classic [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] analysis, that shows how fairy tales educate, support, and liberate children's emotions. The motif of the huntsman cutting open the wolf he interpreted as a "rebirth"; the girl who foolishly listened to the wolf has been reborn as a new person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tatar, Maria |title=The Annotated Brothers Grimm|page= 148 |isbn= 0-393-05848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norse myth===
The poem "[[Þrymskviða]]" from the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' mirrors some elements of Red Riding Hood. [[Loki]]'s explanations for the strange behavior of "[[Freyja]]" (actually [[Thor]] disguised as Freyja) mirror the wolf's explanations for his strange appearance. The red hood has often been given great importance in many interpretations, with a significance from the dawn to blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dundes, Alan &amp; McGlathery, James M. (ed.)|title=Intrepreting Little Red Riding Hood Psychoanalytically|page= 32|work=The Brothers Grimm and Folktale|isbn= 0-252-01549-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erotic, romantic, or rape connotations===
A sexual analysis of the tale may also include negative connotations in terms of rape or abduction. In ''Against Our Will'', [[Susan Brownmiller]] describes the fairy tale as a description of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Orenstein, Catherine |title=Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked: Sex, Morality, and the Evolution of a Fairy Tale|pages= 145|isbn= 0-465-04125-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, many revisionist retellings choose to focus on empowerment, and depict Little Red Riding Hood or the grandmother successfully defending herself against the wolf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Orenstein, Catherine |title=Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked: Sex, Morality, and the Evolution of a Fairy Tale|pages= 160–161|isbn= 0-465-04125-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such tellings bear some similarity to the "animal bridegroom" tales, such as ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' or ''[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]]'', but where the heroines of those tales transform the hero into a prince, these tellings of ''Little Red Riding Hood'' reveal to the heroine that she has a wild nature like the hero's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Orenstein, Catherine |title=Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked: Sex, Morality, and the Evolution of a Fairy Tale|pages= 172–173|isbn= 0-465-04125-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These interpretations refuse to characterize Little Red Riding Hood as a victim; these are tales of female empowerment.

* In Michelle Augello-Page's story "Wolf Moon",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Augello-Page, Michelle|work=Into the Woods|pages=59–66|title=Wolf Moon|isbn= 978-1-291-75208-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little Red is an adult who has been irrevocably changed by the events in her childhood, and it is the hunter who saves her "once upon a time, and again" in this tale of sexual awakening, [[bdsm]], relationships, female rites and rebirth.

'''''Notre-Dame, une fin d'après-midi''''' ("A Glimpse of Notre-Dame in the Late Afternoon") is a painting by [[Henri Matisse]] from 1902. Its somber coloration is typical of Matisse's works executed between the end of 1901 and the end of 1903, a period of personal difficulties for the artist. This episode has been called Matisse's Dark Period.&lt;ref name="Spurling33"&gt;Spurling, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is an oil painting on paper mounted on canvas and it measures 72.5 × 54.5&amp;nbsp;cm (28½ × 21½ in). It is in the [[Albright–Knox Art Gallery]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

==Background==
Between 1896 and 1901, Matisse's painting had progressed from the subdued tones of his earliest works to an intense colorism that prefigured the [[Fauvism]] to come. In 1896 and 1897 he had traveled to [[Brittany]], where the Australian painter [[John Peter Russell]] encouraged him to paint ''[[en plein air]]''. Through Russell he met [[Camille Pissarro]], whose influence was decisive in making a colorist of Matisse.&lt;ref&gt;UCLA Art Council 1966, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898 he traveled to [[London]], where he studied the works of [[J. M. W. Turner]]; then, after a year spent in [[Corsica]] and [[Toulouse]], he returned to Paris, where the startling boldness of his work was admired by  other young artists.&lt;ref name="UCLA10"&gt;UCLA Art Council 1966, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; His paintings found few buyers, however, and his wife, Amélie, had to open a dress shop to support their household.&lt;ref name="UCLA10"/&gt; 

In May 1902 a major financial scandal, the [[Thérèse Humbert|Humbert Affair]], unexpectedly ensnared Amélie's family. Her mother ( who was the Humbert family's housekeeper)  and father became scapegoats in the scandal; as a result, Matisse was forced to spend much of his time during the next year dealing with lawyers and journalists.&lt;ref name="Spurling33" /&gt; His studio was searched by detectives, and his wife's family was menaced by angry mobs of fraud victims.&lt;ref name="Spurling33" /&gt; According to art historian [[Hilary Spurling]], "their public exposure, followed by the arrest of his father-in-law, left Matisse as the sole breadwinner for an extended family of seven. This is why he switched to painting canvases that were at least potentially saleable".&lt;ref name="Spurling33" /&gt;

Inspired by [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] and [[Antoine-Louis Barye|Barye]], Matisse struggled to master volume in sculpture as well as in painting. He darkened his palette, with the results seen in the present work, and in such paintings as ''Carmelina'' (1903, in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]).&lt;ref name="UCLA10" /&gt;

'''''Occupational Hazards: My Time Governing in Iraq''''' or '''''The Prince of the Marshes: And other Occupational Hazards of a Year in Iraq''''' is a 2006 non-fiction book by the British writer and Member of Parliament [[Rory Stewart]].

== Content==
'''''Occupational Hazards''''' documents Stewart's experiences as [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] Deputy Governor of the Iraqi province of [[Maysan]] and Senior Advisor in the province of [[Dhi Qar]]. These provinces in the remote, impoverished marsh regions of [[southern Iraq]] were home to a diverse number of parties and peoples and Stewart spends much of his time mediating, negotiating hostage releases, holding elections, and trying to restore order to a society which seemed on the edge of civil war, following the [[Iraq War]]. Much of the book is concerned with Stewart's dealings with the Prince of the Marshes, a local warlord who had fought against [[Saddam Hussein]] and regarded Stewart's actions with suspicion. '''''Occupational Hazards''''' explores the hostility experienced by Coalition troops and administrators, mostly notably when, in May 2004, Stewart and his compound in [[Nasiriyah]] were besieged by [[Sadrist]] militia, an experience he recounted in his [[Desert Island Discs]] appearance of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008pdqp|title=BBC Radio 4 - Desert Island Discs, Rory Stewart|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
'''''Occupational Hazards''''' received positive reviews following its publication, with ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[William Grimes (journalist)|William Grimes]] describing it as "a rueful, richly detailed, often harrowing account...the real value of [which] is Mr. Stewart's sobering picture of the difficulties involved in creating a coherent Iraqi state based on the rule of law".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/28/books/28book.html|title=An Outsider Confronts the Tide in the Marshes of Iraq|last=Grimes|first=William|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Morphet]], writing in [[The Guardian]], described it as "an extraordinarily vivid tale with many exciting episodes" and Maya Jasanoff called it "an eye-opening and at times enthralling book" in [[London Review of Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/10/highereducation.news2|title=Review: Occupational Hazards by Rory Stewart|last=Morphet|first=David|date=2006-06-10|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n07/maya-jasanoff/one-enduring-trace-of-our-presence|title=One Enduring Trace of Our Presence|last=Jasanoff|first=Maya|date=2007-04-05|work=London Review of Books|access-date=2018-11-02|pages=11–12|issn=0260-9592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Barrett''' designed and provided the artwork for a set of [[Postage stamps and postal history of Great Britain|United Kingdom postage stamps]] depicting dogs in 1979. A commemorative [[First day of issue|first day cover]] was also brought out.

==Illustrations==

Peter Barrett's career as an illustrator took off after writing and illustrating a three book series for very young children, along with his wife Susan Barrett. Published by [[Ward Lock]], the books (The circle Sara drew, The square Ben drew, The line Sophie drew) became very popular. Barrett subsequently concentrated on animal art and illustrations, illustrating numerous children's non-fiction books, specializing in dogs, horses and dinosaurs. His illustrations for ''Birdwatcher's Diary'', by ''Roger Lovegrove'', in 1982 drew critical acclaim.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

A biographical perspective of his work was published in 1986 by his wife Susan Barrett titled "Travels with a wildlife artist: the living landscape of Greece". Peter Barrett illustrated the book and also contributed to the text. In the decades of the 1980s and 1990s, his stature as an animal artist and children's book illustrator has grown hand in hand. Peter Barrett illustrated reprints and collections of  famous animal centric stories and books by [[Gerald Durrell]], [[Desmond Morris]] and [[James Herriot]]. He illustrated a number of books under the highly popular [[Little Golden Books]] label for children. He has also illustrated the 1987 Random House edition of the children's classic [[The Wind in the Willows]], by [[Kenneth Grahame]].

'''"Remember about the Gas{{snd}} Do not buy Russian goods!"''' ({{lang-uk|Пам'ятай про газ{{snd}} не купуй російських товарів!}}) is a [[nonviolent resistance]] social [[boycott]] of [[Russia]]n goods in [[Ukraine]] that arose as a reaction to political pressure of the Russian Federation on Ukraine in the [[2005–06 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute|gas conflict of 2005–2006 years]]. The campaign had started in December 2005, probably with putting up flyers by unknown activists in [[Kirovohrad]]. After publicity this idea had been taken by other social and political organizations. Active actions were being continued in this campaign mainly in the gas conflict of 2005–2006 and [[2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute|2008–2009]] between Ukraine and the Russian Federation.

=== 2009 ===
On 1 January 2009, Russian Federation had stopped supplying natural gas to Ukraine's during the new [[2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute|Ukrainian-Russian gas conflict]]. Gas transit pipeline was completely blocked. That same evening, activists of the Alliance "Maidan" spread through the Internet call for a boycott of Russian goods, recalling the experience of the campaign in 2005-2006. Actions of the Russian authorities to Ukraine gas were called [[racketeering]]: "''Once more in the early days of the New Year [[Moscow]] and its "[[Gazprom]]" started gas racket against Ukraine. But every Ukrainian has also leverage on an aggressive neighbor, NOT CONSUME ITS OUTPUT!''"&lt;ref name="Maidan_01.01.2009"&gt;[http://maidanua.org/static/viol/1230840572.html Пам'ятай про газ!

In January 2009, the idea was picked up by several [[social media]]. In particular, it was called to a boycott of Russian goods during the action against Russia's policy towards Ukraine in [[Kiev]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://kbulkin.wordpress.com/2009/01/17/christmas-gas-cock-vertep-russian-embassy/ Різдвяний газово-вентильний вертеп перед посольством Росії / The Christmas Gas-Cock Vertep In Front of Russian Embassy].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Reactions ==
In December 2005, former Rada Chairman [[Volodymyr Lytvyn]] said he would not send his friends any [[SMS]] with the text "Remember about the Gas{{snd}} Do not buy Russian goods", because he believes that it will increase the ethnic strife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maidanua.org/static/news/1135889313.html Литвин не вміє писати смс і не знає про міжнаціональну ворожнечу] {{uk icon}}. Maidan. 29 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, scientists of the Institute of State and Law of the National Academy of Sciences Ukraine expressed that the campaign resulted in strengthening agitation [[Party of Regions]] and [[Viktor Yanukovych]] during the [[Political campaign|election campaign]] in [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2006|2006 parliamentary elections]] to the introduction of Russian as a second language in Ukraine, and for closer integration of Ukraine with Russia within the [[Common Economic Space (CIS)|Common Economic Space]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eli.org.ua/upload/iblock/d00/magazine_file_8.pdf Вибори та демократія] {{uk icon}}.

After putting up flyers in [[Kirovohrad]] by unknown activists, several grocery stores stopped to do orders of Russian chocolate and [[Baltika Breweries|beer "Baltika"]].&lt;ref name="Gazeta.ua_20.02.2006"/&gt;

According to activists in early 2006 Spiritual Directorate of Buddhists Ukraine "Ninhma in Ukraine" supported its decision to boycott Russian goods. On their [http://ningma.org.ua/ website] they allegedly hung a banner "Do not buy Russian goods!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://maidanua.org/static/news/1136604767.html Українські буддисти також за бойкот російських товарів] {{uk icon}}. Maidan. 7 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Estimations ==
According to historian Yaroslav Svatko he expressed in February 2006, the campaign was unexpected for the Russian government and led to unexpected consequences for her spontaneous, decentralized distribution in society the idea of separation of Ukrainian interests of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Yaroslav Svatko.

== Name ==
From the beginning of the campaign name came from the phrase "Remember about the gas" and "do not buy Russian goods" probably with leaflets those were handed by unknown activists in [[Kirovohrad]]. It was used by the activists of Alliance "Maidan" as "Remember the gas{{snd}}do not buy Russian goods!"&lt;ref name="Maidan_23.12.2005"/&gt; In that form phrase was most particularly through the media. But also phrase "Remember the gas{{snd}} do not buy Russian goods" (without the exclamation mark) was widely used. In 2009, the option "Remember the gas! Do not buy Russian goods!"&lt;ref name="Maidan_01.01.2009"/&gt; It was also used as well as other derivative forms.

== Successors ==
In August 2013, public campaign with similar name and concept was emerged in response to [[export blockade of Ukraine by Russia]]. It also got wide publicity and distribution in Ukraine, called "[[Do not buy Russian goods!]]" Later one more campaign was appeared{{snd}} "[[Boycott Russian Films]]".

The '''Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük''' (also '''Çatal Höyük''') is a baked-clay, nude female form, seated between feline-headed arm-rests. It is generally thought&lt;ref&gt;A typical assessment: "A terracotta statuette of a seated (mother) goddess giving birth with each hand on the head of a leopard or panther from Çatalhöyük (dated around 6000 B.C.E.)" (Sarolta A. Takács, "Cybele and Catullus' ''Attis''", in Eugene N. Lane, ''Cybele, Attis and related cults: essays in memory of M.J. Vermaseren'' 1996:376.&lt;/ref&gt; to depict a corpulent and fertile [[Mother Goddess]]&lt;ref&gt;So rendered in popularized accounts, such as ''The Oxford Companion to World Mythology'', 2005: ''s.v.'' "Hittite-Hurrian mythology": "...the goddess of Çatalhöyük,&lt;!--Hüyük in original--&gt; her Anatolian descendants were the great [[Phrygia]]n goddess Cybele, the mother of the sacrificed [[Attis]], and the many-breasted [[Temple of Artemis|Artemis of Ephesus]]."&lt;/ref&gt; in the process of giving birth while seated on her throne, which has two hand rests in the form of  feline (leopard or panther) heads. The statuette, one of several [[iconography|iconographically]] similar ones found at the site, is associated to other corpulent prehistoric goddess figures,&lt;ref&gt;Noted in Honour and Fleming 2005 "Ch.1: Before History"&lt;/ref&gt; of which the most famous is the [[Venus of Willendorf]].

It is a [[neolithic]] sculpture shaped by an unknown artist, and was completed sometime about 6000 BC. It was unearthed by [[archaeologist]] [[James Mellaart]] in 1961 at [[Çatalhöyük]], [[Turkey]]. When it was found, its head and hand rest of the right side were missing. The current head and the hand rest are modern replacements. The sculpture is at the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]] in [[Ankara]], Turkey.

Although self-portraits have been made since the earliest times, it is not until the [[Early Renaissance]] in the mid-15th century that artists can be frequently identified depicting themselves as either the main subject, or as important characters in their work.  With better and cheaper [[mirror]]s, and the advent of the [[panel painting|panel]] portrait, many painters, sculptors and printmakers tried some form of '''self-portraiture'''. ''[[Portrait of a Man in a Turban]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]] of 1433 may well be the earliest known panel self-portrait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Lorne|series=National Gallery Catalogues (new series)|title=The Fifteenth Century Netherlandish Paintings|pages=212–17|year=1998|isbn=1-85709-171-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He painted a separate portrait of his wife, and he belonged to the social group that had begun to commission portraits, already more common among wealthy Netherlanders than south of the Alps.  The genre is venerable, but not until the [[Renaissance]], with increased wealth and interest in the individual as a subject, did it become truly popular.&lt;ref name="research.umbc.edu"&gt;[http://www.research.umbc.edu/~ivy/selfportrait/back.html accessed online July 28, 2007 an online history of self-portraits, various excerpts from Edward Lucie-Smith and Sean Kelly, ''The Self Portrait: A Modern View'' (London: Sarema Press, 1987)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903144700/http://www.research.umbc.edu/~ivy/selfportrait/back.html |date=September 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A self-portrait may be a [[portrait]] of the artist, or a portrait included in a larger work, including a group portrait.  Many painters are said to have included depictions of specific individuals, including themselves, in painting figures in religious or other types of composition. Such paintings were not intended publicly to depict the actual persons as themselves, but the facts would have been known at the time to artist and [[Patron#Arts|patron]], creating a talking point as well as a public test of the artist's skill.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Lorne, ''Renaissance Portraits, European Portrait-Painting in the 14th, 15th and 16th Centuries'', pp. 3-4, 1990, Yale, {{ISBN|0-300-04675-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest surviving examples of medieval and [[Renaissance]] self-portraiture, historical or mythical scenes (from the [[Bible]] or [[classical literature]]) were depicted using a number of actual persons as models, often including the artist, giving the work a multiple function as portraiture, self-portraiture and history/myth painting. In these works, the artist usually appears as a face in the crowd or group, often towards the edges or corner of the work and behind the main participants. [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]'s ''The Four Philosophers'' (1611–12)&lt;ref name="Four Philosophers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Web Gallery of Art: Rubens, Pieter Pauwel – The Four Philosophers, 1611–12|url=http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/r/rubens/41portra/09philos.html | year=2010 | accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a good example. This culminated in the 17th century with the work of [[Jan de Bray]]. Many artistic media have been used; apart from paintings, drawings and [[old master print|prints]] have been especially important.

In the famous ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' (1434), [[Jan van Eyck]] is probably one of two figures glimpsed in a mirror – a surprisingly modern conceit. The Van Eyck painting may have inspired [[Diego Velázquez]] to depict himself in full view as the painter creating ''[[Las Meninas]]'' (1656), as the Van Eyck hung in the palace in Madrid where he worked. This was another modern flourish, given that he appears as the painter (previously unseen in official royal portraiture) and standing close to the King's family group who were the supposed main subjects of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Lorne; National Gallery Catalogues (new series): ''The Fifteenth Century Netherlandish Paintings'', pp 180, 1998, {{ISBN|1-85709-171-X}}, {{OL|392219M}}, {{OCLC|40732051}}, {{LCCN|98066510}}, (also titled ''The Fifteenth Century Netherlandish Schools''). The ''Arnolfini Portrait'' hung in the same palace in Madrid in which ''Las Meninas'' was painted&lt;/ref&gt;

In what may be one of the earliest childhood self-portraits now surviving, [[Albrecht Dürer]] depicts himself as in naturalistic style as a 13-year-old boy in 1484. In later years he appears variously as a merchant in the background of [[Biblical]] scenes and as [[Christ]].&lt;ref name="Durer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Albrecht Dürer and his Legacy: The graphic work of a Renaissance artist|url=http://www.studio-international.co.uk/painting/durer.asp | publisher=Studio International Magazine | date=March 2003 | accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] may have drawn a [[Self-portrait (Leonardo da Vinci)|picture of himself]] at the age of 60, in around 1512. The picture is often straightforwardly reproduced as Da Vinci's appearance, although this is not certain.

In the 17th century, [[Rembrandt]] painted a range of self-portraits. In ''[[The Prodigal Son in the Tavern]]'' (c1637), one of the earliest self-portraits with family, the painting probably includes Saskia, Rembrandt's wife, one of the earliest depictions of a family member by a famous artist. Family and professional group paintings, including the artist's depiction, became increasingly common from the 17th century on. From the later 20th century on, video plays an increasing part in self-portraiture, and adds the dimension of audio as well, allowing the person to speak to us in their own voice.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Women painters===
[[Women artists]] are notable producers of self-portraits; almost all significant women painters have left an example, from [[Caterina van Hemessen]] to the prolific [[Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun]], and [[Frida Kahlo]], as well as [[Alice Neel]], [[Paula Modersohn-Becker]] and [[Jenny Saville]] who painted themselves in the nude.  Vigée-Lebrun painted a total of 37 self-portraits, many of which were copies of earlier ones, painted for sale. Until the 20th century women were usually unable to train in drawing the nude, which made it difficult for them to paint large figure compositions, leading many artists to specialize in portrait work. Women artists have historically embodied a number of roles within their self-portraiture. Most common is the artist at work, showing themselves in the act of painting, or at least holding a brush and palette. Often, the viewer wonders if the clothes worn were those they normally painted in, as the elaborate nature of many ensembles was an artistic choice to show her skill at fine detail.

== Antiquity ==
Images of artists at work are encountered in [[Ancient Egypt]]ian painting, and sculpture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/egypt/amarna/akh_patron/akh_patron_page2.html|title=Pharaohs Of The Sun|date=19 June 2009|publisher=|accessdate=11 March 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619031921/http://www.mfa.org/egypt/amarna/akh_patron/akh_patron_page2.html|archivedate=19 June 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also on [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[vase]]s. One of the first self-portraits was made by the Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]]'s chief sculptor Bak in 1365 BC. [[Plutarch]] mentions that the Ancient Greek sculptor [[Phidias]] had included a likeness of himself in a number of characters in the "[[Amazonomachy|Battle of the Amazons]]" on the [[Parthenon]], and there are classical references to painted self-portraits, none of which have survived.

==Asia==
Portraits and self-portraits have a longer continuous history in Asian art than in Europe.  Many in the [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar gentleman]] tradition are quite small, depicting the artist in a large landscape, illustrating a poem in [[calligraphy]] on his experience of the scene.  Another tradition, associated with [[Zen Buddhism]], produced lively semi-caricatured self-portraits, whilst others remain closer to the conventions of the formal portrait.

[[Illuminated manuscripts]] contain a number of apparent self-portraits, notably those of Saint [[Dunstan]] and [[Matthew Paris]].  Most of these either show the artist at work, or presenting the finished book to either a donor or a sacred figure, or venerating such a figure.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathon Alexander; ''Medieval Illuminators and their Methods of Work''; p.8-34, Yale UP, 1992, {{ISBN|0-300-05689-3}} collects several examples&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Orcagna]] is believed to have painted himself as a figure in a [[fresco]] of 1359,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} which became, at least according to [[art historian]]s — [[Vasari]] records a number of such traditions — a common practice of artists.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} However, for earlier artists, with no other portrait to compare to, these descriptions are necessarily rather speculative. Among the earliest self-portraits are also two frescos by [[:File:Aquila Johannes – Self-portrait (1392).jpg|Johannes Aquila]], one in [[Velemér]] (1378), western Hungary, and one in [[Martjanci]] (1392), northeastern Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FtlMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA527 |title=The Grove Encyclopedia of Medieval Art and Architecture |first=Colum |last=Hourihane |chapter=Johannes Aquila de Rakerspurga |page=527 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-19-539536-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy [[Giotto di Bondone]] (1267–1337) included himself in the cycle of "eminent men" in the Castle of Naples, [[Masaccio]] (1401–1428) depicted himself as one of the [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]] in the painting of the [[Brancacci Chapel]], and [[Benozzo Gozzoli]] includes himself, with other portraits, in the [[Palazzo Medici]] ''Procession of the Magi'' (1459), with his name written on his hat. This is imitated a few years later by [[Sandro Botticelli]], as a spectator of ''the [[Adoration of the Magi of 1475 (Botticelli)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' (1475), who turns from the scene to look at us.
Fourteenth-century sculpted portrait busts of and by the [[Peter Parler|Parler family]] in [[Prague Cathedral]] include self-portraits, and are among the earliest such busts of non-royal figures. [[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]] included a small head of himself in his [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)#Baptistery doors|most famous work]].
Notably, the earliest self-portrait painted in England, other than in a [[manuscript]], is the miniature painted in oils on panel by the German artist [[Gerlach Flicke]], 1554.

===Albrecht Dürer, 1471–1528, the first prolific self-portraitist===

[[Albrecht Dürer]] was an artist highly conscious of his public image and reputation, whose main income came from his [[old master print]]s, all containing his famous monogram, which were sold throughout Europe.  He probably depicted himself more often than any artist before him, producing at least twelve images, including three oil portraits, and figures in four [[altarpiece]]s.  The earliest is a [[silverpoint]] drawing created when he was thirteen years old.  At twenty-two Dürer painted the ''Self-portrait with Carnation'' (1493, Louvre), probably to send to his new fiancée.  The Madrid self-portrait (1498, [[Museo del Prado|Prado]]) depicts Dürer as a dandy in fashionable Italian dress, reflecting the international success he had achieved by then.  In [[Self-Portrait (Dürer)|his last self-portrait]], sold or given to the city of [[Nuremberg]], and displayed publicly, which very few portraits then were, the artist depicted himself with an unmistakable resemblance to [[Jesus Christ]] (Munich, [[Alte Pinakothek]]).  He later re-used the face in a religious engraving of, revealingly, the [[Veil of Veronica]], Christ's own "self-portrait" (B.25).  A self-portrait in [[gouache]] he sent to [[Raphael]] has not survived. A woodcut of a bathhouse and a drawing show virtually nude self-portraits.&lt;ref&gt;For all this section, Giulia Bartrum, ''Albrecht Dürer and his Legacy'', p. 77–84 &amp; passim, British Museum Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-7141-2633-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance and Baroque===
The great Italian painters of the Renaissance made comparatively few formal painted self-portraits, but often included themselves in larger works. Most individual self-portraits they have left were straightforward depictions; Dürer's showmanship was rarely followed, although a controversially attributed ''Self-portrait as David'' by [[Giorgione]] would have something of the same spirit, if it is a self-portrait. There is a portrait by [[Pietro Perugino]] of about 1500 (Collegio del Cambio of [[Perugia]]), and one by the young [[Parmigianino]] showing the view in a convex mirror. There is also a drawing by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1512),&lt;ref&gt;This drawing in red chalk is widely (though not universally) accepted as an original self-portrait. The main reason for hesitation in accepting it as a portrait of Leonardo is that the subject is apparently of a greater age than Leonardo ever achieved. But it is possible that he drew this picture of himself deliberately aged, specifically for Raphael's portrait of him in the [[School of Athens]]. A case has also been made, originally by novelist [[Dmitry Merezhkovsky]], that Leonardo based his famous picture ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' on his own self-portrait.&lt;/ref&gt; and self-portraits in larger works by [[Michelangelo]], who gave his face to the skin of [[St. Bartholomew]] in the ''[[Last Judgement]]'' of the [[Sistine Chapel]] (1536–1541), and [[Raphael]] who is seen in the characters of ''[[School of Athens]]'' 1510, or with a friend who holds his shoulder (1518). Also notable are two [[Self-Portrait (Titian, Madrid)|portraits]] of [[Titian]] as an old man in the 1560s. [[Paolo Veronese]] appears as a violinist clothed in white in his ''[[Marriage at Cana]]'', accompanied by Titian on the [[bass viol]] (1562).  Northern artists continued to make more individual portraits, often looking very much like their other bourgeois sitters. [[Johan Gregor van der Schardt]] produced a painted [[terracotta]] bust of himself (c. 1573).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Johan Gregor van der Schardt and the Moment of Self-Portraiture in Sculpture |first=Frits |last=Scholten |pages=195–220 |journal=Simiolus: Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art |volume=33 |issue=4 |year=2008 |jstor=25608493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Titian]]'s ''[[Allegory of Prudence]]'' (c. 1565–70) is thought to depict Titian, his son Orazio, and a young cousin, Marco Vecellio.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Panofsky]] (and originally [[Fritz Saxl]]), ''Titian's "Allegory of Prudence", A Postscript'', in ''Meaning in the Visual Arts'', Doubleday/Penguin, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; Titian also painted a late self-portrait in 1567; apparently his first. Baroque artist [[Artemisia Gentileschi]]'s ''La Pittura (Self-portrait as the allegory of painting)'' presents herself embodying the classical allegorical representation of Painting, seen in the dramatic mask worn around Gentileschi's neck which Painting often carries. The artist's focus on her work, away from the viewer, highlights the drama of the Baroque period, and the changing role of the artist from craftsperson to singular innovator.&lt;ref name="Frances Borzello 1998"&gt;[[Frances Borzello]], ''Seeing Ourselves: Women's Self-Portraiture'', 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caravaggio]] painted himself in ''[[Bacchus (Caravaggio)|Bacchus]]'' at the beginning of his career, then appears in the [[staffage]] of some of his larger paintings. Finally, the head of [[Goliath]] held by [[David]] (1605–10, [[Galleria Borghese]]) is Caravaggio's own.

===Rembrandt and the 17th century in Northern Europe===
In the 17th century,  [[Flanders|Flemish]] and Dutch artists painted themselves far more often; by this date most successful artists had a position in society where a member of any trade would consider having their portrait painted. Many also include their families, again following the normal practice for the middle-classes. [[Mary Beale]], [[Anthony van Dyck]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens]] gave us numerous images of themselves, the latter also often painting his family. This practice was especially common for women artists, whose inclusion of their families was often a deliberate attempt to mitigate criticism of their profession causing distraction from their "natural role" as mothers.&lt;ref name="Frances Borzello 1998"/&gt;

[[Rembrandt]] was the most frequent self-portraitist, at least until the self-obsessed modern period, also often painting his wife, son and mistress. At one time about ninety paintings were counted as Rembrandt self-portraits, but it is now known that he had his students copy his own self-portraits as part of their training. Modern scholarship has reduced the autograph count to something over forty paintings, as well as a few drawings and thirty-one [[etching]]s, which include many of the most remarkable images of the group. Many show him posing in quasi-historical fancy dress, or pulling faces at himself. His oil paintings trace the progress from an uncertain young man to the dapper and very successful portrait-painter of the 1630s to the troubled but massively powerful portraits of his old age.&lt;ref&gt;For this section and the gallery, [[Ernst van de Wetering]] in ''Rembrandt by himself'', p.10 and passim, 1999, National Gallery, London/Mauritshuis, The Hague, {{ISBN|1-85709-270-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After Rembrandt===
[[File:VanGogh-self-portrait-with bandaged ear.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Self-Portrait of [[Van Gogh]] with head bandaged, after he (debatedly) cut off part of his ear.]]
In Spain, there were self-portraits of [[Bartolomé Estéban Murillo]] and [[Diego Velázquez]]. [[Francisco de Zurbarán]] represented himself in [[Luke the Evangelist]] at the feet of Christ on the cross (around 1635). In the 19th century, Goya painted himself numerous times. French self-portraits, at least after [[Nicolas Poussin]] tend to show the social status of the artist, although [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] and some other instead showed their real working costume very realistically.  This was a decision all 18th-century self-portraitists needed to make, although many painted themselves in both formal and informal costume in different paintings. Thereafter, one can say that most significant painters left us at least one self-portrait, even after the decline of the painted portrait with the arrival of photography. [[Gustave Courbet]] (see below) was perhaps the most creative self-portraitist of the 19th century, and ''The Artist's studio'' and ''Bonjour, Monsieur Courbet'' are perhaps the largest self-portraits ever painted. Both contain many figures, but are firmly centred on the heroic figure of the artist.

One of the most famous and most prolific of self-portraitists was [[Vincent van Gogh]], who drew and painted himself more than [[Self-portraits by Vincent van Gogh|43 times]] between 1886 and 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/painting/commentaire_id/portrait-de-lartiste-433.html?tx_commentaire_pi1%5BpidLi%5D=509&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1%5Bfrom%5D=841&amp;cHash=b052379f62|title=Musée d'Orsay: Vincent van Gogh Self-Portrait|website=www.musee-orsay.fr|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/genres/self-portraits.htm Encyclopedia of Irish and World Art, art of self-portrait] Retrieved June 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In all of these self-portraits one is struck that the gaze of the painter is seldom directed at us; even when it is a fixed gaze, he seems to look elsewhere. These paintings vary in intensity and color and some portray the artist with bandages; representing the episode in which he severed one of his ears.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TEgP2yBPb_sC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=national+gallery+of+art+on+van+gogh+self+portraits&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5ePtn0FWSA&amp;sig=sDtbzXn5lZIYXDOkLk-N91IfFjE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NQQVTM7RM4OClAemz4HgDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=national%20gallery%20of%20art%20on%20van%20gogh%20self%20portraits&amp;f=false  Andrea Bassil, ''Lives of the Artists, Vincent van Gogh'' pp.36-37] Retrieved June 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The many self-portraits of [[Egon Schiele]] set new standards of openness, or perhaps  [[exhibitionism]], representing him naked in many positions, sometimes masturbating or with an erection, as in ''Eros'' (1911).  [[Stanley Spencer]] was to follow somewhat in this vein.  [[Max Beckmann]] was a prolific painter of self-portraits &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gagosian.com/publications/1992_max-beckmann_the-self-portraits/ ''Max Beckmann, The Self Portraits''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029133400/http://www.gagosian.com/publications/1992_max-beckmann_the-self-portraits/ |date=2011-10-29 }} Retrieved October 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Edvard Munch]] who made great numbers of self-portrait paintings (70),  prints (20) and drawings or watercolours (over 100) throughout his life, many showing him being badly treated by life, and especially by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.munch.museum.no/exhibitions.aspx?id=35|title=Fant ikke siden – Munch|publisher=|accessdate=11 March 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927094502/http://www.munch.museum.no/exhibitions.aspx?id=35|archivedate=27 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Obsessively using the self-portrait as a personal and introspective artistic expression was [[Horst Janssen]], who produced hundreds of self-portraits depicting him a wide range of contexts most notably in relation to sickness, moodyness and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mahagoni-magazin.de/graphik/horst-janssen-selbstportraits-%E2%80%93-am-abgrund-des-spiegels|title=Horst Janssen: Selbstportraits – am Abgrund des Spiegels|publisher=|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2004 exhibition "Schiele, Janssen. Selbstinszenierung, Eros, Tod" (Schiele, Janssen: Self-dramatisation, Eros, Death) at the Leopold Museum in Vienna paralleled the works of [[Egon Schiele]] and [[Horst Janssen]], both heavily drawing on sujets of erotica and death in combination with relentless self-portraiture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/61447|title=basis wien - Schiele, Janssen. Selbstinszenierung, Eros, Tod|first=basis|last=wien|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frida Kahlo]], who following a terrible accident spent many years bedridden, with only herself for a model, was another painter whose self-portraits depict great pain, in her case physical as well as mental.  Her 55-odd self-portraits include many of herself from the waist up, and also some nightmarish representations which symbolize her physical sufferings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amybrown.net/women/frida.html ''Amazing women'' Frida Kahlo, ''I am not sick.

Throughout his long career, [[Pablo Picasso]] often used self-portraits to depict himself in the many different guises, disguises and incarnations of his autobiographical artistic persona. From the young unknown "Yo [[Picasso]]" period to the "[[Minotaur]] in the [[Labyrinth]]" period, to the "old [[Cavalier]]" and the "lecherous old artist and model" periods. Often Picasso's self-portraits depicted and revealed complicated psychological insights, both personal and profound about the inner state and well being of the artist. Another artist who painted personal and revealing self-portraits throughout his career was [[Pierre Bonnard]]. Bonnard also painted dozens of portraits of his wife Marthe throughout her life as well. [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Egon Schiele]] and [[Horst Janssen]] in particular made intense (at times disturbingly so) and self-revealing self-portraits throughout their careers.

===Classification===
Art critic Galina Vasilyeva-Shlyapina separates two basic forms of the self-portrait: "professional" portraits, in which the artist is depicted at work, and "personal" portraits, which reveal moral and psychological features. She also proposes a more detailed taxonomy: (1) the "insertable" self-portrait, where the artist inserts his or her own portrait into, for example, a group of characters related to some subject; (2) the "prestigious, or symbolic" self-portrait, where an artist depicts him- or herself in the guise of a historical person or religious hero; (3) the "group portrait" where artist is depicted with members of family or other real persons; (4) the "separate or natural" self-portrait, where the artist is depicted alone.  However it might be thought these classes are rather rigid; many portraits manage to combine several of them.&lt;ref&gt;Respectively, the ''"вставной"'',''"представительский, или символический"'', ''"групповой портрет"'', ''"отдельный или естественный"''&lt;/ref&gt;

With new media came a chance to create different kinds of self-portraits besides simply static painting or photographs. Many people, especially teens, use social networking sites to form their own personal identity on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;danah boyd. "Why Youth (Heart) Social Networking Sites: The Role of Networked Publics in Teenage Social Life." MacArthur Foundation Series on Digital Learning, Identity Volume. ed. David Buckingham.&lt;/ref&gt; Still others use blogs or create personal web pages to create a space for self-expression and self-portraiture.

===Mirrors and poses===

[[File:Las Meninas, by Diego Velázquez, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Las Meninas]]'', painted in 1656, shows [[Diego Velázquez]] working at the easel to the left.]]

The self-portrait supposes in theory the use of a [[mirror]]; glass mirrors became available in Europe in the 15th century.  The first mirrors used were convex, introducing deformations that the artist sometimes preserved. A painting by [[Parmigianino]] in 1524 ''Self-portrait in a mirror'', demonstrates the phenomenon.  Mirrors permit surprising compositions like the ''Triple self-portrait'' by [[Johannes Gumpp]] (1646), or more recently that of [[Salvador Dalí]] shown from the back painting his wife, [[Gala Dalí|Gala]] (1972–73).
This use of the mirror often results in right-handed painters representing themselves as left-handed (and vice versa). Usually the face painted is therefore a mirror image of that the rest of the world saw, unless two mirrors were used.  Most of Rembrandt's self-portraits before 1660 show only one hand – the painting hand is left unpainted.&lt;ref&gt;''Rembrandt by himself'', op cit, p.211&lt;/ref&gt;  He appears to have bought a larger mirror in about 1652, after which his self-portraits become larger. In 1658 a large mirror in a wood frame broke whilst being transported to his house; nonetheless, in this year he completed his Frick self-portrait, his largest.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The size of single-sheet mirrors was restricted until technical advances made in France in 1688 by [[Bernard Perrot]].  They also remained very fragile, and large ones were much more expensive pro-rata than small ones – the breakages were recut into small pieces.  About 80&amp;nbsp;cm, or two and a half feet, seems to have been the maximum size until then – roughly the size of the palace mirror in ''Las Meninas'' (the convex mirror in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' is considered by historians impractically large, one of Van Eyck's many cunning distortions of scale).&lt;ref&gt;''Rembrandt by himself'', op cit, pp 11-13; for the Arnolfini reference see: National Gallery Catalogues (new series): ''The Fifteenth Century Netherlandish Paintings'', Lorne Campbell, 1998, {{ISBN|1-85709-171-X}}, {{OL|392219M}}, {{OCLC|40732051}}, {{LCCN|98066510}}, (also titled ''The Fifteenth Century Netherlandish Schools'')&lt;/ref&gt; Largely for this reason, most early self-portraits show painters at no more than half-length.
 
Self-portraits of the artist at work were, as mentioned above, the commonest form of medieval self-portrait, and these have continued to be popular, with a specially large number from the 18th century on.  One particular type in the medieval and Renaissance periods was the artist shown as Saint [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] (patron saint of artists) painting the [[Virgin Mary]].  Many of these were presented to the local [[Guild of Saint Luke]], to be placed in their chapel.  A famous large view of the artist in his studio is ''[[The Artist's Studio]]'' by [[Gustave Courbet]] (1855), an immense "Allegory" of objects and characters amid which the painter sits.

The self-portraits of many [[Contemporary art]]ists and [[Modernist]]s often are characterized by a strong sense of [[narrative]], often but not strictly limited to vignettes from the artists life-story. Sometimes the narrative resembles fantasy, roleplaying and fiction. Besides [[Diego Velázquez]], (in his painting [[Las Meninas]]), [[Rembrandt Van Rijn]], [[Jan de Bray]], Gustave Courbet, [[Vincent van Gogh]], and [[Paul Gauguin]] other artists whose self-portraits reveal complex narratives include [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Alice Neel]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Lucas Samaras]], [[Jenny Saville]], [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Gilbert and George]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Self-promotion===
The self-portrait can be a very effective form of advertising for an artist, especially of course for a portrait painter.  Dürer was not really interested in portraits commercially, but made good use of his extraordinary self-portraits to advertise himself as an artist, something he was very sophisticated in doing. [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] painted intricate miniatures which served as advertisements for her skill as well as novelty items, considered such because the rarity of successful women painters provided them with an oddity quality.&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollack&lt;/ref&gt; Rembrandt made his living principally from portrait-painting during his most successful period, and like [[Van Dyck]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]], many of his portraits were certainly intended to advertise his skills.  With the advent of regular Academy shows, many artists tried to produce memorable self-portraits to make an impression on the artistic stage.  A recent exhibition at the National Gallery, London, ''Rebels and Martyrs'', did not shrink from the comic bathos that sometimes resulted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/rebels_martyrs/default.htm Rebels and Martyrs, National Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819201018/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/rebels_martyrs/default.htm |date=2007-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example from the 21st century is [[Arnaud Prinstet]], &lt;!-- notable? Bit of a self-promoter, I suspect this is vanity – Jmabel --&gt; an otherwise little-known contemporary artist who has generated good amounts of publicity by undertaking to paint his self-portrait every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=Arnaud+Prinstet&amp;hl=en&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2006-32,GGLG:en&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N|title=Arnaud Prinstet - Google Search|website=www.google.com|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some artists depicted themselves very much as they did other clients.

== Diagnosing the self-portrait ==
[[File:Egon Schiele 073.jpg|thumb|120px|Self-portrait of Egon Schiele 1911, depicting [[masturbation]].]]
Some artists who suffered neurological or physical diseases have left self-portraits of themselves that have allowed later physicians to attempt to analyze disruptions of mental processes; and many of these analyses have entered into the textbooks of [[neurology]].&lt;ref name="research.umbc.edu"/&gt;

The self-portraits of artists who suffered mental illnesses give a unique possibility to physicians for investigating self-perception in people with psychological, psychiatric or neurologic disturbances.

Russian sexologist [[Igor Kon]] in his article about [[masturbation]] notes that a habit of masturbating may be depicted in works of art, particularly paintings. So Austrian artist Egon Schiele depicted himself so occupied in one of his self-portraits. Kon observes that this painting does not portray [[pleasure]] from the masturbation, but a feeling of [[solitude]]. Creations of Schiele are analyzed by other researchers in terms of [[human sexual behavior|sexuality]], and particularly [[pedophilia]].

==Collections==
One of the most distinguished, and oldest, collections of self-portraits is in the [[Vasari Corridor]] of the [[Uffizi Gallery]] in [[Florence]]. It was originally the collection by the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Leopoldo de' Medici]] in the second part of the 17th century and has been maintained and expanded until the present time. It is mostly not on view for general visitors, although some paintings are shown in the main galleries.  Many famous artists have not been able to resist an invitation to donate a self-portrait to the collection.  It comprises more than 200 portraits, in particular those of [[Pietro da Cortona]], [[Charles Le Brun]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]], and [[Marc Chagall]]. Other important collections are housed at the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)]] in London (with various satellite outstations elsewhere), and the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] in Washington, D.C..

===Photo-portraits===
{{see also|Francesca Woodman|Cindy Sherman|George Chakravarthi|selfie|space selfie}}
Two methods of obtaining photographic self-portraits are widespread. One is photographing a reflection in the mirror, and the other photographing one's self with the camera in an outstretched hand. [[Eleazar Langman]] photographed his reflection on the surface of a nickel-plated teapot.

Another method involves setting the camera or capture device upon a tripod, or surface. One might then set the camera's timer, or use a remote controlled shutter release.

Finally, setting up the camera, entering the scene and having an assistant release the shutter (i.e., if the presence of a cable release is unwanted in the photo) can arguably be regarded as a photographic self-portrait, as well. The speed of creating photographic self-portraits allowed for a range of images with more of a "play" atmosphere than traditional methods. One such example is [[Frances Benjamin Johnston]]'s ''Self-Portrait, c. 1896'', an image which demonstrates the photo-portrait's ability to play with gender roles.&lt;ref name="Frances Borzello 1998"/&gt;

* Tielsch AH, Allen PJ (2005) ''Listen to them draw: screening children in primary care through the use of human figure drawings''. Pediatr Nurs 31(4): 320–327. &lt;span style="font-size:smaller;"&gt;This survey of literature is focused on the method of drawing people as the method of diagnostics. Children's figures can recognize mental disorders. The authors describe the use of self-portraits for diagnostics of emotional disorders in children from 6 to 12 years. Although this procedure does not make it possible to place final diagnosis, it is useful for the recognition of problems.&lt;/span&gt;

Int J Aging Hum Dev 56(1): 1-41. &lt;span style="font-size:smaller;"&gt;Patients with hemiplegia have diverse problems of self-perception, which are caused by neurological defeats of the idea of body, or by psychological problems with the perception their own self.&lt;/span&gt;

=== Psychology of self-perception ===

* Wegner DM (2003) The mind's self-portrait. Ann N Y Acad Sci 1001: 212–225.  &lt;span style="font-size:smaller;"&gt;Psychology and neuroscience approach understanding of reason and consciousness. Meanwhile, each human reason contains the self-portrait, which contains the self-appraisal of cognitive processes. This self-portrait assumes that the actions of man are governed by thoughts and, thus, the body is governed by consciousness. Self-portrait leads to the persuasion, that we consciously desire to make something. Studies show that self-portraiture is a caricature on the function of the brain, but at the same time it is the basis of the sensation of authorship and responsibility of one's own actions.&lt;/span&gt;

'''Sunpendulum''' is an art, science and technology project&lt;ref name="Report"/&gt;  devised by [[Austria]]n [[New media art|media artist]] Kurt Hofstetter.&lt;ref name="Basis Wien"/&gt;

==Concept==
;''Watching the sky&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; "Inplusion" phase''
Twelve [[video camera]]s called "time-eyes" are connected to the [[internet]] in twelve locations in twelve [[time zone]]s around the [[Earth]], observing the sky twenty four hours per day, continuously creating a hypothetical "sun clock" which spans the planet.&lt;ref name="Inplusion"/&gt;

;''Viewing the results&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; "Explosion" phase''
→ '' &lt;small&gt;'''Note:'''&lt;/small&gt; This section describes "pavilions" which have not been constructed or installed.''

[[Image:stationphi.jpg|thumb|right|Scale model pavilion.]]
At a location to be determined within each time zone, twelve screens are intended to be arranged in a circle within a [[pavilion]]&lt;ref name="Pavilion"/&gt;  meant to remain open for visitors twenty four hours per day.  The screens, connected online with the time-eyes, transmit the images from the twelve time zones.&lt;ref name="Explosion"/&gt;  As the earth rotates, the images transmitted by the time-eyes move within a pavilion's circle of screens where day and night may be vicariously experienced in parallel. 
 
Each pavilion, a circular structure of twenty four pairs of half cylinders, each pair of which resembles in horizontal cross section the [[Hopi]] symbol '''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;''' '''&lt;sub&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''' for universal brotherhood,&lt;ref name="Symbol"/&gt; is intended to allow twenty four points of entry for visitors while preventing local light from reaching the screens.  An arrangement of rooftop [[solar cell]]s is hypothesized to produce the necessary energy.&lt;ref name="Explosion"/&gt;

==Kernel team==
The kernel team consists of scientists (chiefly from the Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms at the [[Vienna University of Technology]]) and artists.  Its primary tasks are ongoing technical developments which maintain the integrity of the project and its hardware and software.

==Collaboration partners==
The collaboration partners are scientific and academic institutions which host the time-eye cameras, hardware and servers and participate in the project's international [[cross-cultural]] cooperation.

{{nihongo|'''''The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife'''''|蛸と海女|Tako to ama|''[[Octopus]](es) and [[ama diver|shell diver]]''}}, also known as '''''Girl Diver and Octopuses''''', '''''Diver and Two Octopuses''''', etc., is a [[Woodblock printing|woodblock-printed]] design by the [[Japan]]ese artist [[Hokusai]]. It is included in ''Kinoe no Komatsu'' ({{lang-en|Young Pines}}), a three-volume book of [[Shunga (art)|shunga]] erotica first published in 1814, and has become Hokusai's most famous shunga design. Playing with themes popular in Japanese art, it depicts a young [[ama diver]] entwined sexually with a pair of [[octopus]]es.

==History and description==
''The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife'' is the most famous image in ''Kinoe no Komatsu'', published in three volumes from 1814. The book is a work of [[Shunga (art)|shunga]] ([[erotic art]]) within the [[ukiyo-e]] genre.&lt;ref&gt;Uhlenbeck, p. 56; 161.&lt;/ref&gt; The image depicts a woman, evidently an ''[[ama diver|ama]]'' (a shell diver), enveloped in the [[cephalopod limb|limbs]] of two octopuses. The larger of the two mollusks performs [[cunnilingus]] on her, while the smaller one, his offspring, assists by fondling the woman's mouth and left nipple. In the text above the image the woman and the creatures express their mutual sexual pleasure from the encounter.&lt;ref name=Uhlenbeck&gt;Uhlenbeck, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

All designs in the publication are untitled; this design is generally known in Japanese as ''Tako to ama'', translated variously into English. [[Richard Douglas Lane]] calls it ''Girl Diver and Octopi'';&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Matthi Forrer calls it ''Pearl Diver and Two Octopi'';&lt;ref&gt;Forrer, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; and Danielle Talerico calls it ''Diver and Two Octopi''.&lt;ref name=Talerico&gt;Talerico 24-42.&lt;/ref&gt; The open book measures 6½" × 8&amp;frac34;" (16.51&amp;nbsp;cm × 22.23&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akantiek.nl/hokusai%20p1290.htm Famous Shunga Masterpiece Diving Girl With Octopus - Hokusai - c.1814]  AK Antiek.

Scholar Danielle Talerico notes that the image would have recalled to the minds of contemporary viewers the story of [[Tide jewels#Later references|Princess Tamatori]], highly popular in the [[Edo period]].&lt;ref name=Uhlenbeck/&gt; In this story, Tamatori is a modest shell diver who marries [[Fujiwara no Fuhito]] of the [[Fujiwara clan]], who is searching for a pearl stolen from his family by [[Ryūjin]], the dragon god of the sea. Vowing to help, Tamatori dives down to Ryūjin's undersea palace of [[Ryūgū-jō]], and is pursued by the god and his army of sea creatures, including octopuses. She cuts open her own breast and places the jewel inside; this allows her to swim faster and escape, but she dies from her wound soon after reaching the surface.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;Miller, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tamatori story was a popular subject in [[ukiyo-e]] art. The artist [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]] produced works based on it, which often include octopuses among the creatures being evaded by the bare-breasted diver.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; In the text above Hokusai's image, the big octopus says he will bring the girl to Ryūjin's undersea palace, strengthening the connection to the Tamatori legend.&lt;ref name=Talerico/&gt; ''The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife'' is not the only work of Edo-period art to depict erotic relations between a woman and an octopus. Some early [[netsuke]] carvings show cephalopods fondling nude women.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Symmes, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Hokusai's contemporary [[Yanagawa Shigenobu]] created an image of a woman receiving cunnilingus from an octopus very similar to Hokusai's in his collection ''Suetsumuhana'' of 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.stolaf.edu/people/kucera/YoshidaWebsite/evolution/essay_pages/anne_lenehan_white.htm|title= Shunga and Ukiyo-e: Spring Pictures and Pictures of the Floating World|last1= Lenehan-White|first1= Anne|work= |publisher= www.stolaf.edu|accessdate= 6 November 2010|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090204154824/http://stolaf.edu/people/kucera/YoshidaWebsite/evolution/essay_pages/anne_lenehan_white.htm|archivedate= 4 February 2009|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talerico notes that earlier Western critics such as [[Edmond de Goncourt]] and Jack Hillier interpreted the work as a [[rape]] scene. She notes that these scholars would have seen it apart from the ''Kinoe no Komatsu'' collection and without understanding the text and visual references, depriving it of its original context.&lt;ref name=Talerico/&gt; Goncourt did, however, know its original context, which he describes in a passage of his monograph on Hokusai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hokusai|last=Goncourt|first=Edmond de|publisher=Bibliothèque Charpentier|year=1896|isbn=|location=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k82459v|pages=174–175|via=Gallica}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chris Uhlenbeck and Margarita Winkel, "[t]his print is testimony to how our interpretation of an image can be distorted when seen in isolation and without understanding the text."&lt;ref name=Uhlenbeck/&gt;

==Influence==
The image is often cited as a forerunner of [[tentacle erotica]], a motif that has been common in modern Japanese animation and [[manga]] since the late 20th century, popularized by author [[Toshio Maeda]]. Modern tentacle erotica similarly depicts sex between women and tentacled beasts; the sex in modern depictions is typically [[rape|forced]], as opposed to Hokusai's mutually pleasurable interaction.&lt;ref name=Briel&gt;Briel, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist and critic Jerry S. Piven is skeptical that Hokusai's playful image could account for the violent depictions in modern media, arguing that these are instead a product of the turmoil experienced throughout Japanese society following [[World War II]], which was in turn reflective of existing, underlying currents of cultural trauma.&lt;ref&gt;Piven, p. 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Holger Briel argues that "only in a society that already has a predilection for monsters and is used to interacting with octopods such images might arise", citing Hokusai's print an early exemplar of such a tradition.&lt;ref name=Briel/&gt;

The work has influenced later artists such as [[Félicien Rops]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Louis Aucoc]], [[Fernand Khnopff]] and [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;Bru, pp. 55–77.&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso painted his own version in 1903 that has been shown next to Hokusai's original in exhibits on the influence of 19th-century Japanese art on Picasso's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Picasso's Japanese erotic inspiration on show in Barcelona|first= |last= |newspaper= [[The Independent]]|date= 6 November 2009 |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/picassos-japanese-erotic-inspiration-on-show-in-barcelona-1815988.html|accessdate=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, a derivative work by Australian painter David Laity,  titled ''The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife'', sparked a minor obscenity controversy when it was shown at a gallery in [[Melbourne]]; after receiving complaints Melbourne police investigated and  decided it did not break the city's anti-pornography laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Love is a many-tentacled thing... |first= |last= |newspaper= [[The New Zealand Herald]]|date= 21 October 2003 |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=3529966|agency=[[New Zealand Press Association]]|accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Melbourne row over art 'porn'|first= David|last= Fickling |newspaper= [[The Guardian]]|date= 22 October 2003 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/22/arts.australia|agency=|accessdate=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hokusai's print has had a wide influence on the modern Japanese-American artist [[Masami Teraoka]], who has created images of women, including a recurring "pearl diver" character, being pleasured by cephalopods as a symbol of female sexual power.&lt;ref&gt;Bing, pp. 44–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called ''aria della piovra'' ("Octopus aria") ''Un dì, ero piccina'' in [[Pietro Mascagni]]'s opera ''[[Iris (opera)|Iris]]'' (1898), on a libretto by [[Luigi Illica]], may have been inspired by this print. The main character Iris describes a screen she had seen in a Buddhist temple when she was a child, depicting an octopus coiling its limbs around a smiling young woman and killing her. She recalls a Buddhist priest explaining: "That octopus is Pleasure... That octopus is Death!"&lt;ref&gt;Mallach, p. 127 and note.&lt;/ref&gt;

The print is featured briefly in Park Chan Wook's ''[[The Handmaiden]]'' and is intended to illustrate the perverted nature of Uncle Kouzuki's oppression of Lady Hideko to Sook-Hee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thefilmstage.com/reviews/cannes-review-the-handmaiden/|title=[Cannes Review] The Handmaiden|date=14 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gets more air time in several episodes of the television series ''[[Mad Men]]'', first on the office wall of founding Sterling-Cooper partner Bert Cooper; the print is given to [[Peggy Olson]] by [[Roger Sterling|Roger Sterling, Jr.]] near the [[Person to Person (Mad Men)|series' end]]. Olson decides to hang the print in her office, part of the culmination of her storyline of becoming comfortable as an executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fusion.net/story/129910/what-you-need-to-know-about-that-octopus-erotica-on-mad-men-last-night/|title=What you need to know about that octopus erotica on 'Mad Men'|first=Molly|last=Fitzpatrick|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is of a graveyard, as night is coming on. Beyond the graveyard wall there is a low chapel with a bell. In the foreground of the scene, there are two nuns – the heads of the two nuns are level and symmetrical. There is no evidence that they are [[Roman Catholic]] nuns. Many of the pre Raphaelite brotherhood would have known of the growing Anglican sisterhoods, some of whose sisters joined Catholic Sisters with Florence Nightingale on her mission to the Crimea.  One of the nuns holds a [[rosary]], and one of the nuns is digging a grave. Her forearm and body strain under the weight of a shovelful of earth. The other, overseeing the work, turns with a look of apprehension and anguish.
 
Art critic Tom Lubbock said of the painting:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Millais Everett, Sir John: The Vale Of Rest (1858-9) |first=Tom |last=Lubbock |date=29 August 2008 |publisher=
[[The Independent on Sunday]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/great-works/millais-everett-sir-john-the-vale-of-rest-18589-911859.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Graves. Dusk. A walled enclosure. The spooky, looming trees. Nuns. Catholics (in England then, still an object of suspicion). Sexual segregation. Religiosity. Mistress and servant, a power relationship, maybe some deeper emotional bondage. Female labour. Something being buried or exhumed. Twin wreaths. The deep dark earth. Corpses, secrets, conspiracy, fear. It's a picture that pulls out all the stops."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The painting is one of those satirised in [[Florence Claxton]]'s watercolour ''The Choice of Paris – an idyll'' (1860). Claxton criticized "the perceived ugliness of early pre-Raphaelite paintings by exaggerating details from many of their works, including ''The Vale of Rest'', ''Claudio and Isabella'', and, lying in the grass, Alice Gray from ''Spring''"&lt;ref&gt; Suzanne Fagence Cooper, Pre Raphaelite Art in the V&amp;A, 2003, p.113 &lt;/ref&gt;

Underdrawing was used extensively by 15th century painters like [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Rogier van der Weyden]]. These artists "underdrew" with a brush, using hatching strokes for shading, using water-based black paint, before [[underpainting]] and [[overpainting]] with oils.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} [[Cennino D'Andrea Cennini]] (14th century most likely) describes a different type of underdrawing, made with graded tones rather than hatching, for [[egg tempera]].

In some cases, underdrawing can be clearly visualized using [[infrared]] reflectography because [[carbon black]] pigments absorb infrared light, whereas opaque pigments such as lead white are transparent with infrared light.  Underdrawing in many works, for example, the [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)]] or the [[Arnolfini Portrait]], reveals that artists made [[pentimento|alterations]], sometimes radical ones, to their compositions.

The '''Winter Palace''' ({{lang-rus|Зимний дворец|Zimnij dvorets|p=ˈzʲimnʲɪj dvɐˈrʲɛts}}) in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia, was, from 1732 to 1917, the official residence of the [[List of Russian rulers|Russian monarchs]]. Today, the restored palace forms part of a complex of buildings housing the [[Hermitage Museum]]. Situated between the [[Palace Embankment]] and the [[Palace Square]], adjacent to the site of [[Peter the Great]]'s original Winter Palace, the present and fourth Winter Palace was built and altered almost continuously between the late 1730s and 1837, when it was severely damaged by fire and immediately rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;The numbering of the Winter Palaces varies. Most referees used in the writing of this page refer to the present palace as the fourth. That is: Trezzini, 1711 (I);  Mattarnovy, 1721 (II); Trezzini, 1727 (III) and Rastrelli, 1732 (IV). Thus, to agree with the majority and because these four versions were "palaces" each differing from the last rather than recreations, this will be the numbering used here. However, other sources count the log cabin of Peter the Great as the first palace, while others discount Trezzini's 1727 rebuilding and others count the 1837 reconstruction as a 5th Winter palace. [https://web.archive.org/web/20071126025206/http://spbcity.info/eng/content/view/44/30/ One source] (not used here) numbers a temporary wooden structure erected to house the court during the building of the present palace.&lt;/ref&gt; The storming of the palace in 1917 as depicted in Soviet paintings and [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]]'s 1927 film ''October'' became an iconic symbol of the [[Russian Revolution]].

The palace was constructed on a monumental scale that was intended to reflect the might and power of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]]. From the palace, the [[Tsar]]&lt;ref&gt;In 1721, Tsar [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] received the title of Emperor from the [[Governing Senate]]. Scholars use the titles of "Tsar" and "Emperor" (and their feminine forms) interchangeably.&lt;/ref&gt; ruled over {{convert|22400000|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} (almost 1/6 of the Earth's landmass) and over 125&amp;nbsp;million subjects by the end of the 19th century. It was designed by many architects, most notably [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli|Bartolomeo Rastrelli]], in what came to be known as the [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabethan Baroque]] style. The green-and-white palace has the shape of an elongated rectangle, and its principal façade is {{convert|215|m|ft}} long and {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. The Winter Palace has been calculated to contain 1,786 doors, 1,945 windows, 1,500 rooms and 117 staircases. Following a serious fire, the palace's rebuilding of 1837 left the exterior unchanged, but large parts of the interior were redesigned in a variety of tastes and styles, leading the palace to be described as a "19th-century palace inspired by a model in [[Rococo]] style".&lt;ref name="Budberg, p.200"&gt;Budberg, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]] massacre occurred when demonstrators marched toward the Winter Palace, but by this time the Imperial Family had chosen to live in the more secure and secluded [[Alexander Palace]] at [[Tsarskoe Selo]], and returned to the Winter Palace only for formal and state occasions. Following the February Revolution of 1917, the palace was for a short time the seat of the [[Russian Provisional Government]], led by [[Alexander Kerensky]]. Later that same year, the palace was stormed by a detachment of [[Red Army]] soldiers and sailors—a defining moment in the birth of the Soviet state.

== Peter the Great's Winter Palace (1711–1753) ==
[[File:1st Winter Palace.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The first Winter Palace, designed in 1711 for Peter the Great, by [[Domenico Trezzini]] who, 16 years later, was to design the third Winter Palace.]]

Later returning from his [[Grand_Embassy_of_Peter_the_Great|Grand Embassy]] in 1698, [[Peter I of Russia]] embarked on a policy of [[Westernization]] and expansion that was to transform the [[Tsardom of Russia]] into the [[Russian Empire]] and a major European power.&lt;ref&gt;Massie 1981, pp. 234–243&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was manifested in bricks and mortar by the creation of a new city, Saint Petersburg, in 1703.&lt;ref&gt;Massie 1981, pp. 355–366&lt;/ref&gt; The culture and design of the new city was intended as a conscious rejection of traditional [[Byzantine]]-influenced [[Russian architecture]], such as the then-fashionable [[Naryshkin Baroque]], in favour of the classically inspired architecture prevailing in the great cities of Europe. The Tsar intended that his new city would be designed in a Flemish renaissance style, later known as [[Petrine Baroque]], and this was the style he selected for his new palace in the city. The first Royal residence on the site had been a humble log cabin then known as the [[Cabin of Peter the Great|Domik Petra I]], built in 1704, which faced the [[River Neva]]. In 1711 it was transported to the Petrovskaya Naberezhnaya&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saint-petersburg.com/embankments/peters-quay/ Peter's Quay on the St Petersburg Website]&lt;/ref&gt;, where it still stands.&lt;ref name="Petrakova"&gt;Petrakova&lt;/ref&gt;  With the site cleared, the Tsar then embarked on the building of a larger house between 1711 and 1712. This house, today referred to as the first Winter Palace, was designed by [[Domenico Trezzini]].&lt;ref&gt;Swiss Architecture on the Neva. Trezzini, catalogue of works. 1711&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th century was a period of great development in European royal architecture, as the need for a fortified residence gradually lessened. This process, which had begun in the late 16th century, accelerated and great classical palaces quickly replaced fortified castles throughout the more powerful European countries. One of the earliest and most notable examples was [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. Largely completed by 1710, Versailles—with its size and splendour—heightened rivalry amongst the sovereigns of Europe. Peter the Great of Russia, keen to promote all western concepts, wished to have a modern palace like his fellow sovereigns. However, unlike some of his successors, Peter I never aspired to rival Versailles.

[[File:PtheGspalace.jpg|thumb|400px|right|The third Winter Palace of 1727. Designed by [[Domenico Trezzini]] it incorporated the second Winter Palace of 1721 by [[Georg Mattarnovy]] as one of its terminating pavilions.]]

The first Winter Palace was a modest building of two main floors under a slate roof.&lt;ref&gt;Budberg, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that Peter soon tired of the first palace, for in 1721, the second version of the Winter Palace was built under the direction of architect [[Georg Johann Mattarnovy|Georg Mattarnovy]]. Mattarnovy's palace, though still very modest compared to royal palaces in other European capitals, was on two floors above a rusticated ground floor, with a central projection underneath a [[pediment]] supported by columns.&lt;ref&gt;Budberg, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that Peter the Great died in 1725.

The Winter Palace was not the only palace in the unfinished city, or even the most splendid, as Peter had ordered his nobles to construct residences and to spend half the year there.&lt;ref name="Cowles, p.49"&gt;Cowles, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; This was an unpopular command; Saint Petersburg was founded upon a swamp, with little sunlight, and it was said only cabbages and turnips would grow there. It was forbidden to fell trees for fuel, so hot water was permitted just once a week. Only Peter's second wife, Empress [[Catherine I of Russia|Catherine]], pretended to enjoy life in the new city.&lt;ref name="Cowles, p.49" /&gt;

As a result of pressed slave labour from all over the Empire,&lt;ref name="Cowles, p.58"&gt;Cowles, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; work on the city progressed quickly. It has been estimated that 200,000 people died in twenty years while building the city.&lt;ref name="Cowles, p.58" /&gt; A diplomat of the time, who described the city as "a heap of villages linked together, like some plantation in the West Indies", just a few years later called it "a wonder of the world, considering its magnificent palaces".&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these new palaces in Peter's beloved Flemish Baroque style, such as the [[:File:Kikin.jpg|Kikin Hall]] and the [[Menshikov Palace]], still stand.

==The palace 1725–1855==
[[File:Johrdan staircase.jpg|thumb|200px|left|upright|The principal or "[[Jordan Staircase of the Winter Palace|Jordan Staircase]]", ''(8 on the plan below)'' so-called because on the Feast of the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] the Tsar descended this [[Imperial staircase]] in state for the ceremony of the "Blessing of the Waters." It is one of the few parts of the palace retaining Rastrelli's 18th century rococo style. The massive grey granite columns were, however, added in the mid-19th century. Painting by [[Konstantin Ukhtomsky]].&lt;ref name="Budberg, p. 198"&gt;Budberg, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

On Peter the Great's death in 1725, the city of Saint Petersburg was still far from being the centre of western culture and civilization that he had envisioned. Many of the aristocrats who had been compelled by the Tsar to inhabit Saint Petersburg left. Wolves roamed the squares at night while bands of discontented pressed [[serf]]s, imported to build the Tsar's new city and [[Baltic fleet]], frequently rebelled.

Peter I was succeeded by his widow, Catherine I, who reigned until her death in 1727. She in turn was succeeded by Peter I's grandson [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]], who in 1727 had Mattarnovy's palace greatly enlarged by the architect [[Domenico Trezzini]].&lt;ref name="Petrakova" /&gt; Trezzini, who had designed the Summer Palace in 1711, was one of the greatest exponents of the [[Petrine Baroque]] style, now completely redesigned and expanded Mattarnovy's existing Winter Palace to such an extent that Mattarnovy's entire palace became merely one of the two terminating pavilions of the new, and third, Winter Palace.&lt;ref&gt;Budberg, p196&lt;/ref&gt; The third palace, like the second, was in the Petrine Baroque style.

In 1728, shortly after the third palace was completed, the Imperial Court left Saint Petersburg for Moscow, and the Winter Palace lost its status as the principal imperial residence. Moscow had once again been designated the capital city, a status which had been granted to Saint Petersburg in 1713. Following the death of Peter II in 1730, the throne passed to a niece of Peter I, [[Anna of Russia|Anna Ivanovna, Duchess of Courland]].

=== Anna (1730–1740) ===
The new Empress cared more for Saint Petersburg than her immediate predecessors; she re-established the Imperial court at the Winter Palace and, in 1732, Saint Petersburg again officially replaced Moscow as Russia's capital, a position it was to hold until 1918.

Ignoring the third Winter Palace, the Empress on her return to Saint Petersburg took up residence at the neighbouring Apraksin Palace.&lt;ref name="Petrakova" /&gt; In 1732, the Tsaritsa commissioned the architect [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] to completely rebuild and extend the Apraksin Palace, incorporating other neighbouring houses.&lt;ref&gt;Patrakova&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the core of the fourth and final Winter Palace is not the palace of Peter the Great, but the palace of Admiral General [[Fyodor Matveyevich Apraksin]].&lt;ref name="Petrakova" /&gt;

The Empress Anna, though unpopular and considered "dull, coarse, fat, harsh and spiteful",&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; was keen to introduce a more civilized and cultured air to her court. She designed new liveries for her servants and, on her orders, mead and vodka were replaced with champagne and Burgundy. She instructed the [[Boyars]] to replace their plain furniture with that of mahogany and ebony,&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; while her own tastes in interior decoration ran to a dressing table of solid gold and an "[[easing stool]]" of silver, studded with rubies. It was against such a backdrop of magnificence and extravagance that she gave her first ball in the newly completed gallery at the Winter Palace, which, in the middle of the Russian winter, resembled an orange grove.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt; This, the fourth version of the Winter Palace, was to be an ongoing project for the architect Rastrelli throughout the reign of the Empress Anna.

===Elizabeth (1741–1762)===
{{Winter Palace}}
The infant Tsar [[Ivan VI of Russia|Ivan VI]], succeeding Anna in 1740, was soon deposed in a bloodless coup d'état by [[Elizabeth of Russia|Grand Duchess Elizabeth]], a daughter of Peter the Great. Delegating almost all powers to her favourites, the new Empress Elizabeth assumed a life of pleasure which led the court at the Winter Palace to be described later by the Russian historian [[Vasily Klyuchevsky]] as a place of "gilded squalor".&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of Elizabeth, Rastrelli, still working to his original plan, devised an entirely new scheme in 1753, on a colossal scale—the present Winter Palace. The expedited completion of the palace became a matter of honour to the Empress, who regarded the palace as a symbol of national prestige. Work on the building continued throughout the year, even in the severest months of the winter. The deprivation to both the Russian people and the army caused by the ongoing [[Seven Years' War]] were not permitted to hinder the progress. 859,555 [[Russian ruble|rubles]] had been allocated to the project, a sum raised by a tax on state-owned taverns.&lt;ref name="Brumfield1983"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brumfield|first=William Craft|title=Gold in azure: one thousand years of Russian architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eBRQAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=13 April 2011|date=October 1983|publisher=D.R. Godine|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the labourers earned a monthly wage of just one ruble, the cost of the project exceeded the budget, so much so that work ceased due to lack of resources despite the Empress' obsessive desire for rapid completion. Ultimately, taxes were increased on salt and alcohol to fund the extra costs, although the Russian people were already burdened by taxes to pay for the war. The final cost was 2,500,000 rubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Orloff, Alexander |author2=Shvidkovsky, Dmitri |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Saint Petersburg: Architecture of the Tsars|publisher=Abbeville Press|location=New York|year=1996|isbn=0-7892-0217-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1759, shortly before Elizabeth's death, a Winter Palace truly worthy of the name was nearing completion.

===Catherine II (1762–1796)===
It was Empress Elizabeth who selected the German princess, Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst, as a bride for her nephew and successor, [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]]. The marriage was not a success, but it was this princess who, as [[Catherine the Great]], came to be chiefly associated with the Winter Palace. In 1762, following a coup d'état, in which her husband was murdered, Catherine paraded her seven-year-old son, [[Paul I of Russia|Paul]], on the Winter Palace's balcony to an excited crowd below.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; She was not presenting her son as the new and rightful ruler of Russia, however; that honour she was usurping herself.

Catherine's patronage of the architects [[Ivan Starov|Starov]] and [[Giacomo Quarenghi]] saw the palace further enlarged and transformed.&lt;ref name="Budberg, p.200" /&gt; At this time an opera house which had existed in the southwestern wing of the palace was swept away to provide apartments for members of Catherine's family. In 1790, Quarenghi redesigned five of Rastrelli's state rooms to create the three vast halls of the [[Neva Enfilade of the Winter Palace|Neva enfilade]]. Catherine was responsible for the three large adjoining palaces, known collectively as the Hermitage—the name by which the entire complex, including the Winter Palace, was to become known 150 years later.

Catherine had been impressed by the French architect [[Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe]], who designed the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] (also in Saint Petersburg) and commissioned him to add a new wing to the Winter Palace.&lt;ref name="AmeryCurran2006"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Amery|first1=Colin|last2=Curran|first2=Brian|title=St Petersburg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aV-BGNNDM2cC&amp;pg=PA56|accessdate=13 April 2011|year=2006|publisher=Frances Lincoln Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7112-2492-6|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was intended as a place of retreat from the formalities and ceremonies of the court. Catherine christened it the Hermitage ''(14)'', a name used by her predecessor Tsaritsa Elizabeth to describe her private rooms within the palace.

The interior of the Hermitage wing was intended to be a simple contrast to that of the Winter Palace. Indeed, it is said that the concept of the Hermitage as a retreat was suggested to Catherine by that advocate of the simple life, [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]].&lt;ref name=Budberg201&gt;Budberg, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, it was another large palace in itself, connected to the main palace by a series of covered walkways and heated courtyards in which flew rare exotic birds.&lt;ref name="Cowles, p.90"&gt;Cowles, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Noted for its fine portico and attention to details of a delicate nature,&lt;ref name="AmeryCurran2006"/&gt; it was richly furnished with an ever-growing art collection.

[[File:Frans Hals 058.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Frans Hals]]' ''Portrait of a Young Man Holding a Glove'', purchased for the Winter Palace in 1764]]
The palace's art collection was assembled haphazardly in an eclectic manner, often with an eye to quantity rather than quality. Many of the artworks purchased for the palaces arrived as parts of a job lot as the sovereign acquired whole ready-assembled collections. The Empress' ambassadors in Rome, Paris, Amsterdam and London were instructed to look out for and purchase thousands of priceless works of art on her behalf. Ironically, while Saint Petersburg high society and the extended Romanov family derided Russia's [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|last Empress]] for furnishing her palaces "mail order" from [[Sir John Blundell Maple, 1st Baronet|Maples]] of London, she was following the practices of Catherine the Great, who, if not exactly by "mail order", certainly bought "sight unseen."&lt;ref name="Cowles, p.90" /&gt;

In this way, between 1764 and 1781 Catherine the Great acquired six major collections: those of [[Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky]]; [[Heinrich von Brühl]]; [[Pierre Crozat]]; [[Horace Walpole]]; [[Sylvestre-Raphael Baudouin]]; and finally in 1787, the [[Lyde Browne (antiquary)|John Lyde-Brown]] collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_1_11.html|title= 1787: Purchase of the John Lyde-Brown collection, London |publisher=State Hermitage Museum|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These large assemblies of art included works by such masters as [[Rembrandt]], [[Rubens]], [[Titian]], [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]], [[Anthony van Dyck|van Dyck]] and [[Guido Reni|Reni]].&lt;ref name="Cowles, p.90" /&gt; The acquisition of 225 paintings forming the Gotzkowsky collection was a source of personal pride to Catherine. It had been put together by Gotzkowsky for Catherine's adversary, [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great of Prussia]] who, as a result of his wars with Russia, could not afford to pay for it. This collection included some great Flemish and Dutch works, most notably Frans Hals' "Portrait of a Young Man with a Glove."&lt;ref name="The State Hermitage Museum"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_4_1_3.html|title= The Great Hermitage |publisher=State Hermitage Museum|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1769, the Bruhl collection brought to the Winter Palace two further works by Rembrandt, ''Portrait of a Scholar'' and ''Portrait of an Old Man in Red''.

While some aspects of this manic collecting could have been a manifestation of Catherine's desire for a recognition of her intellectual concepts,&lt;ref name=Cowles93/&gt; there was also a more fundamental motivation: necessity. Just twenty years earlier, so scarce were the furnishings of the Imperial palaces that bedsteads, mirrors, tables and chairs had to be conveyed between Moscow and Saint Petersburg each time the court moved.&lt;ref&gt;Kluchevsky, vol IV, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the palace filled with art, it overflowed into the Hermitage. So large did Catherine's art collection eventually become that it became necessary to commission the German-trained architect Yury Velten to build a second and larger extension to the palace, which eventually became known as the Old Hermitage (''15''). Later, Catherine commissioned a third extension, the [[Hermitage Theatre]], designed by [[Giacomo Quarenghi]].&lt;ref&gt;Norman, pp. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; This construction necessitated the demolition of Peter the Great's by now crumbling third Winter palace.

[[File:Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn - A Scholar.JPG|thumb|200px|left|[[Rembrandt]]'s ''Portrait of a Scholar'' purchased in 1769. The painting is one of several by Rembrandt in the former Imperial Collection.]]
The Empress' life within the Hermitage, surrounded by her art and friends, was simpler than in the adjacent Winter Palace; there, the Empress gave small intimate suppers. Servants were excluded from these suppers and a sign on the wall read "Sit down where you choose, and when you please without it being repeated to you a thousand times."&lt;ref name="Cowles, p.90" /&gt;

Catherine was also responsible for introducing the lasting affection for all things French to the Russian court. While she personally disliked France, her distaste did not extend to its culture and manners.&lt;ref name=Cowles93&gt;Cowles, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; French became the language of the court; Russian was relegated for use only when speaking to servants and inferiors. The Russian aristocracy was encouraged to embrace the philosophies of [[Molière]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]] and [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]].&lt;ref name=Cowles93/&gt; The Winter Palace was to serve as a model for numerous Russian palaces belonging to Catherine's aristocracy, all of them, like the Winter Palace itself, built by the slave labour of Russian serfs. The sophistication and manners observed inside the Winter Palace were greatly at odds with the grim reality of life outside its externally gilded walls. In 1767, as the Winter Palace grew in richness and splendour, the Empress published an edict extending [[Russian serfdom]]. During her reign she further enslaved over a million peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Work continued on the Winter Palace right up until the time of the Empress' death in 1796.

===Paul I, Alexander I, and Nicholas I (1796–1855)===
[[File:Winter Palace Rotonda1834.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Rotunda of the Winter Palace|The Rotunda]] ''(26)''.

Painting by [[Yefim Tukharinov]]]]
Catherine the Great was succeeded by her son [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]]. In the first days of his reign, the new Tsar (reported by the British Ambassador to be "not in his senses"&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p.119.&lt;/ref&gt;) augmented the number of troops stationed at the Winter Palace, positioning sentry boxes every few metres around the building. Eventually, paranoid for his security and disliking anything connected with his mother,&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p.117.&lt;/ref&gt; he spurned the Winter Palace completely and built [[Saint Michael's Castle]] as his Saint Petersburg residence, on the site of his birthplace. The Tsar announced that he wished to die on the spot he was born. He was murdered there three weeks after taking up residence in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul I was succeeded by his 24-year-old son, [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], who ruled Russia during the chaotic period of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Following Napoleon's defeat in 1815, the contents of the Winter Palace were further enhanced when Alexander I purchased the art collection of the former French Empress, [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Joséphine]]. This collection, some of it plundered loot given to her by her ex-husband [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]], contained amongst its many old masters Rembrandt's "The Descent from the Cross" and four sculptures by [[Antonio Canova]].&lt;ref name="The State Hermitage Museum" /&gt;

Alexander I was succeeded in 1825 by his brother [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]. Tsar Nicholas was to be responsible for the palace's present appearance and layout. He not only effected many changes to the interior of the palace, but was responsible for its complete rebuilding following the fire of 1837.&lt;ref name="Crankshaw1976"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Crankshaw|first=Edward|title=The shadow of the winter palace: Russia's drift to revolution, 1825–1917|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h-qCAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=13 April 2011|year=1976|publisher=Viking Press|isbn=978-0-670-63782-9|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
As completed, the overriding exterior form of the Winter Palace's architecture, with its decoration in the form of statuary and opulent stucco work on the pediments above façades and windows, is Baroque. The exterior has remained as finished during the reign of [[Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elizabeth]]. The principal façades, those facing the Palace Square and the Neva river, have always been accessible and visible to the public. Only the lateral façades are hidden behind [[granite]] walls, concealing a garden created during the reign of [[Nicholas II]].&lt;ref&gt;Budberg, p. 200.; states the gardens were created by Nicholas I; the Hermitage Museum's own website state these walled gardens were the creation of Alexandra Feodorovna, wife of Nicholas II.&lt;/ref&gt; The building was conceived as a town palace, rather than a private palace within a park, such as that of the French kings at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].

[[File:Nicholas Hall (rectified).jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Nicholas Hall (''6 on plan'') is the principal reception room, at the centre of the [[Neva Enfilade of the Winter Palace|Neva enfilade]]. This room was the setting for court balls. Painting by Konstantin Ukhtomsky&lt;ref name=Budberg201/&gt;]]
The architectural theme continues throughout the interior of the palace. The first floor, being the [[piano nobile]], is distinguished by windows taller than those of the floors above and below. Each window is divided from its neighbour by a [[pilaster]]. The repetitive monotony of the long elevations is broken only by symmetrically placed slightly projecting bays, many with their own small [[portico]]. This theme has been constant during all subsequent rebuilding and alterations to the palace. The only external changes have been in colour: at various times in its history the palace has been painted different shades. In the eighteenth century, the palace was painted straw yellow with white and gilded ornament.  Under Nicholas I in 1837, it was painted a dull red, which it remained through the revolution and early Soviet period. Following the restoration work after World War II, it was painted green with the ornament depicted in white, the standard Soviet color scheme for Baroque buildings. (The [[Stroganov Palace]], for example, was also green and white in this period.){{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Internally, the palace appears as a combination of the Baroque and the Neoclassical. Little of Rastrelli's rococo interior design has survived; only the Jordan Staircase and the Grand Church remain in their original style. The changes to the interior were largely due to the influences of the architects employed by Catherine the Great in the last years of her life, [[Ivan Starov|Starov]] and [[Giacomo Quarenghi|Quarenghi]], who began to alter much of the interior of the palace as designed by Rastrelli. Catherine always wanted the latest fashions, and during her reign the more severe [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] architectural influences, fashionable in Western Europe from the late 1760s, slowly crept towards Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref name="Budberg, p.200" /&gt;  The neoclassical interiors were further emphasised and extended during the reign of Catherine's grandson, Nicholas I.

Quarenghi is credited with introducing the [[Neoclassical style]] to Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref name="Budberg, p.200" /&gt; His work, together with that of [[Karl Ivanovich Rossi]] and [[Auguste de Montferrand]], gradually transformed Saint Petersburg into an "Empire Town". Montferrand not only created some of the palace's greatest neoclassical interiors, but also was responsible for the erection of the [[Column of Alexander]] during the reign of Nicholas I in Rossi's newly designed [[Palace Square]].

For a long time the Winter Palace was the tallest edifice in the city. In 1844, Nicholas I gave the orders to the effect that private houses should be at least 1 sazhen (2.13 m) lower than the Winter Palace. This rule was effective until 1905.&lt;ref name="Winter Palace in St Petersburg Russia"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stpetersburgrussia.ru/palaces/winter_palace|title=Winter Palace|publisher=StPetersburgRussia.ru|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interior===
[[File:Small Throne Room of the Winter Palace.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The Small Throne Room ''(10 on plan)'' was created by [[Auguste de Montferrand]] in 1833. It has columns of [[jasper]]. Diplomats gathered here on New Year's Day to offer good wishes to the Emperor.&lt;ref name=Budberg201/&gt;]]
The Winter Palace is said to contain 1,500 rooms, 1,786 doors and 1,945 windows.&lt;ref&gt;Figures from King, page 169. These figures are widely quoted. However, while the figure of 1,783 windows is likely, a figure of 1,500 rooms would have to include windowless basement rooms, multiple servants rooms in the attics and closets etc. Compare the 2000 rooms in the [[Hofburg Palace|Vienna Hofburg]] and 1400 rooms of [[Schönbrunn Palace|Schönbrunn]], which is much smaller than the Winter Palace. Available plans given by the Hermitage Museum and the original 18th century plans do not show 1,057 rooms. Cowles, p88, claims the Winter Palace had 1,500 rooms, prior to the erection of the adjoining Hermitage.&lt;/ref&gt; The principal façade is {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} high.&lt;ref name="Budberg, p.200" /&gt; The ground floor contained mostly bureaucratic and domestic offices, while the second floor was given over to apartments for senior courtiers and high-ranking officials. The principal rooms and living quarters of the Imperial Family are on the first floor, the piano nobile.&lt;ref&gt;Images of many of the principal rooms can be obtained from the links beneath the plan&lt;/ref&gt; The great state rooms, used by the court, are arranged in two [[enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]]s, from the top of the Jordan Staircase. The original Baroque suite of the Tsaritsa Elizabeth running west, fronting the Neva, was completely redesigned in 1790–93 by Giacomo Quarenghi. He transformed the original enfilade of five state rooms into a suite of three vast halls, decorated with [[faux marble]] columns, [[bas-reliefs]] and statuary.&lt;ref name="Catherine II"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_7_7_1.html|title=Catherine II (1762–1796)|publisher=State Hermitage Museum|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Division of WinterPalace.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Plan showing the use and division of the principal floor, as occupied in the 1840s. 1 (red): State and most formal rooms; 2 (dark green): Apartments of the [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar]]; 3 (pink): Apartments of the [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)|Empress]]; 4: Apartments of the [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsarevich]], other times part of principal guest suite; 5: Apartments of the [[Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse)|Tsarevna]]; 6: Apartments reserved for guests of the highest rank and members of the Imperial Family; 7: Nurseries of [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1831–1891)|the 3rd]] and [[Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia|the 4th]] in line to the throne; 8: General private rooms of the Imperial Family; 9: Principal guest suite, used immediately after their marriage by [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1819-1876)|Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna]] and [[Maximilian, Duke of Leuchtenberg|her husband]]]]
A second suite of state rooms running south to the Great Church was created for Catherine II. Between 1787–95, Quarenghi added a new eastern wing to this suite which contained the great throne room, known as [[St George's Hall, and Apollo Hall of the Winter Palace|St George's Hall]] ''(13)'',&lt;ref name="Catherine II"/&gt; which linked the Winter Palace to Catherine's less formal palace, the Hermitage, next door. This suite was altered in the 1820s when the [[Military Gallery]] ''(11)'' was created from a series of small rooms, to celebrate the defeat of Napoleon. This gallery, which had been conceived by Alexander I, was designed by [[Carlo Rossi (architect)|Carlo Rossi]] and was built between June and November 1826 under Nicolas I; it was inaugurated on 25 October 1826.&lt;ref name="MobileReference"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Saint Petersburg Sights: a travel guide to the top 50 attractions in St. Petersburg, Russia (Mobi Sights)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W9nT8K1RucUC&amp;pg=PT84|accessdate=13 April 2011|publisher=MobileReference|isbn=978-1-60778-932-1|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the 1812 Gallery, the Tsar commissioned 332 portraits of the generals instrumental in the defeat of France. The artist was the Briton [[George Dawe]], who received assistance from [[Alexander Polyakov (artist)|Alexander Polyakov]] and [[Wilhelm August Golicke]].&lt;ref name="The State Hermitage Museum" /&gt;

Nicholas I was also responsible for the creation of the Battle Galleries ''(19)'', which occupy the central portion of the Palace Square façade. They were redesigned by [[Alexander Briullov]] to commemorate the Russian victories prior to 1812. Immediately adjacent to these galleries celebrating the French defeat, were rooms ''(18)'' where [[Maximilian, Duke of Leuchtenberg]], Napoleon's step-grandson and the Tsar's son-in-law, lived during the early days of his marriage.&lt;ref&gt;The website of The State Hermitage Museum records the Duke living in these rooms, soon after his marriage to the [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1819-1876)|Tsar's daughter]], in 1839. The Tsar built the Duke and Duchess of Leuchtenberg the [[Marinsky Palace]] (completed in 1844), thus enabling the Duke to escape to what must have been less humiliating surroundings.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fire of 1837===

{{Main|Fire in the Winter Palace}}
In 1833, de Montferrand was hired to redesign the eastern state rooms and create the Field Marshal's Hall and the Small Throne Room ''(9 &amp; 10)''. In 1837, a fire broke out. Its cause is unknown, but its spread is blamed on de Montferrand. The architect was being hurried by the Tsar for an early completion, so he used wooden materials where stone would have been better. Additionally, between the hurriedly built wooden partition walls disused fireplaces were concealed; their chimneys, coupled with the narrow ventilation shafts, acted as flues for the fire, allowing it to spread undetected between the walls from room to room until it was too late to extinguish.&lt;ref name="Norman, pp. 70–71"&gt;Norman, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Green HermitageFire.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Fire in the Winter Palace]]'' by Boris Green]]

Once detected, the fire continued to spread, but slowly enough that the palace guards and staff were able to rescue many of the contents, depositing them in the snow in Palace Square. This was no mean feat, as the treasures of the Winter Palace were always heavy furniture and fragile ornaments rather than lighter paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alexanderpalace.org/valse/parttwo.html|title= Valse des fleurs|publisher=Sitwell, Sacheveral | accessdate=27 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; To create a firebreak, the Tsar ordered the destruction of the three passages leading to the Hermitage, a fortunate act which saved the building and the huge art collection.&lt;ref name="Fire"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_4_2_1_2.html|title= The Fire of 1837 and Restoration of the Winter Palace |publisher=State Hermitage Museum|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian poet [[Vasily Zhukovsky]] witnessed the conflagration—"a vast bonfire with flames reaching the sky." The fire burned for several days, and destroyed most of the Winter Palace's interior.&lt;ref name="Norman, pp. 70–71" /&gt;

Seeming to ignore the size of the palace, the Tsar ordered that the rebuilding be completed within a year. The [[Marquis de Custine]] described the "unheard of efforts" that were necessary to facilitate this. "During the great frosts 6000 workmen were continually employed; of these a considerable number died daily, but the victims were instantly replaced by other champions brought forward to perish."&lt;ref&gt;de Custine, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was supervised by [[Pyotr Kleinmichel]], who had already gained a reputation for ruthlessness when serving in the [[military settlement]]s under [[Arakcheev]].&lt;ref name=Hayward&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayward|first=Richard Mowbray|title=Russia Enters the Railway Age, 1842-1855|year=1998|publisher=East European Monographs|location=Boulder|isbn=0-88033-390-1|pages=42–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebuilding of the palace took advantage of the latest construction techniques of the industrial age. The roof was supported by a metal framework, while the spans of ceilings in the great halls were supported by iron girders.&lt;ref name="Fire"/&gt; Following the fire, the exterior, most of the principal state suites, the Jordan staircase and the Grand Church were restored to their original design and decoration by the architect [[Vasily Stasov]]. Some of the rooms, such as the second largest room in the Winter Palace, the Armorial Hall, became far more ornate, however, with a heavy use of [[gilding|gilt]].&lt;ref name="Fire"/&gt; The smaller and more private rooms of the palace were altered and decorated in various 19th-century contemporary styles by [[Alexander Briullov]] according to whims and fashion of their intended occupants, ranging from Gothic to rococo.&lt;ref name="Fire"/&gt; The Tsarevna's crimson boudoir ''(23)'', in the [[Private Apartments of the Winter Palace|private Imperial apartments]], was a faithful reproduction of the rococo style, which Catherine II and her architects started to eliminate from the palace less than 50 years earlier. One of the palace's most notable rooms was created as a result of the fire when the Jasper Room, which had been destroyed, was rebuilt as the [[Malachite Room of the Winter Palace|Malachite Drawing Room]], the principal reception room of the Tsaritsa's suite. The Tsar himself, for all the grandeur he created in his palaces, loved the greatest simplicity. His bedroom at the Winter Palace was spartan, with no ornaments save for some maps and an [[icon]], and he slept on a camp bed with a straw mattress.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage of the palace==
[[File:Amorial Hall.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Armorial Hall, or Guard Room, ''(11 on plan)'' is decorated with vast [[stucco]] [[panoply|panoplies]].]]

While the state rooms occupied the northern and eastern wings of the palace and the private rooms of the Imperial Family occupied the western wing, the four corners of the building contained the smaller rooms, which were the apartments of lesser members of the Imperial Family, often being of two floors. This is one of the reasons that the palace can appear a confusing assortment of great halls or salons with no obvious purpose located in odd corners of the palace. The fact that the Malachite Drawing Room is separated from the equally large Gold Drawing Room by a series of bedrooms and small cabinets initially seems unusual. However, when considered in the context that the Malachite Drawing Room was the principal reception room of the Empress' apartment while the Gold Drawing Room was the principal reception room of the apartment of her daughter-in-law, the [[Tsarevna]], the arrangement of the rooms makes more sense. Similarly the vast White Hall, so far from the other grand halls, was in fact the principal hall of the [[Tsarevich]]'s and Tsarevna's apartments. Thus the Winter Palace can be viewed as a series of small palaces within one large palace, with the largest and grandest rooms being public while the residents lived in suites of varying sizes, allocated according to rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saint-petersburg.com/virtual-tour/hermitage.asp|title=The Winter Palace and museum|publisher=Saint-Petersburg.com|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the formal home of the Russian Tsars, the palace was the setting for profuse, frequent and lavish entertaining. The dining table could seat 1000 guests, while the state rooms could contain up to 10,000 people—all standing, as no chairs were provided.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to [[Queen Victoria]] from [[Charles Wynn-Carington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Lord Carrington]]. Quoted: Maylunas, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; These rooms, halls and galleries were heated to such a temperature that while it was sub-zero outside, exotic plants bloomed within, while the brilliant lighting gave the ambiance of a summer's day.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GrandChurch.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Grand Church of the Winter Palace|The Winter Palace's Grand Church]] today retains its original rococo decoration. The [[onion dome]] above it is one of the few concessions to an older Russian architecture allowed to be visible from the exterior. Painting by [[Eduard Hau]]]]
Guests on ceremonial and state occasions would follow a set processional route, arriving at the palace courtyard through the central arch of the south façade, and then entering the palace through the state entrance (sometimes called the ambassadors' entrance) ''(38)''. They would then proceed through the [[colonnade]]d Jordan Hall before mounting the gilded [[Imperial staircase]] ''(8)'', from where the two enfilades of state rooms spread out. The principal or Jordan Staircase, so-called because on the Feast of the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], the Tsar descended in state for the ceremony of the Blessing of the Waters, is one of the few parts of the palace to retain the original 18th century rococo style, although the massive grey granite columns were added in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name="Budberg, p. 198" /&gt;

One of the most important rooms was the [[Grand Church of the Winter Palace|Palace's Grand Church]] ''(16)''. Granted cathedral status, it was of greater religious significance than the chapels of most European royal palaces. It was here that Romanov weddings were usually celebrated with a rigid and unchanging tradition and protocol. Even the bride's dress, and the manner of donning it, was dictated by tradition. Dressed by the Empress, the bride and her procession would pass from the Malachite Drawing Room to the church through the state rooms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Wynn-Carington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Lord Carrington]]. Quoted: Maylunas, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imperial Family were not the only residents of the palace; below the metal framework in the attics lived an army of servants. So vast were the [[servants' quarters]] that a former servant and his family, unbeknownst to the palace authorities, moved into the roof of the palace. They were only discovered by the smell of the manure from the cow that they had also smuggled into the building with them to provide fresh milk.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems this cow was not the only bovine in the attics; other cows were kept next to the room occupied by the Maids of Honour, in order to provide fresh milk for the kitchens. This practice was discontinued after the 1837 fire.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial Hermitage Museum===
{{Main|State Hermitage Museum}}
[[File:New Hermitage.jpg|left|300px|thumb|The [[Atlas (architecture)|Atlantes]] portico to the extension of Catherine II's New Hermitage, Russia's first public art gallery.]]
After the death of Catherine the Great, the Hermitage had become a private treasure house of the Tsars, who continued collecting, albeit not on the scale of Catherine the Great. In 1850, the collection of [[Cristoforo Barbarigo]] was acquired. This collection from Venice brought into the Winter Palace further works by Titian, in addition to many 16th-century Renaissance works of art.

Nicholas I, conscious of the great art galleries in other European capitals, saw that Catherine the Great's Large Hermitage ''(15)'' was vastly expanded and transformed into a purpose-built public art gallery. In 1839, German architect [[Leo von Klenze]] drew up the plans and their execution was overseen by [[Vasily Stasov]], assisted by [[Alexander Briullov]] and [[Nikolai Yefimov]].&lt;ref name="Watkin2005"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Watkin|first=David|title=A history of Western architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39T1zElEBrQC&amp;pg=PA504|accessdate=13 April 2011|date=5 September 2005|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|isbn=978-1-85669-459-9|page=504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Persianova1979"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Persianova|first=Olʹga|title=The Hermitage: room-to-room guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B9UrAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=13 April 2011|year=1979|publisher=Aurora Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; With so many architects involved there were inevitably many conflicts over the design and its execution throughout the 1840s, with the Tsar having frequently to act as moderator.&lt;ref name="Museum construction"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_9_2.html|title=Construction of the Public Museum |publisher=State Hermitage Museum|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, after eleven years of building and architectural conflict, the first art museum in Russia, the Imperial Hermitage Museum, opened on 5 February 1852.&lt;ref name="The State Hermitage Museum" /&gt; The trebeated facades of the building were inspired by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel|Schinkelesque architecture]]. It was erected in grey marble round three courtyards and the complex is noted for the asymmetrical planning of its wings and floors.&lt;ref name="Watkin2005"/&gt; By order of the Tsar, visitors to the museum were required to wear [[Formal wear|evening dress]], even in the morning. The Tsar also decreed that grey top hats were "Jewish" and dress coats "revolutionary."&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;  Having negotiated the dress code, what the public saw was a huge array of art, but only a fraction of the Imperial collection, as the Winter Palace and other Imperial palaces remained closed to the viewing public.

==The last Tsars (1855–1905)==
[[File:Александр II.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] photographed in his study (24) at the Winter Palace]]
The Winter Palace was an official residence of the Russian sovereign from 1732 until 1917; however, it was their home for little more than 140 of those years. The last Tsar to truly reside in the palace was [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], who ruled from 1855 to 1881, when he was assassinated. During his reign there were more additions to the contents; acquisitions included the ancient and archaeological collection of the unfortunate [[Giampietro Campana|Marchese di Cavelli]] in 1861 and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s "Madonna and Child" in 1865; Leonardo's second work of that same name, the so-called "Benois Madonna", was later acquired in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_1_30.html|title=1914: Purchase of Leonardo da Vinci's Madonna with a Flower (Benois Madonna)|publisher=State Hermitage Museum|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander II was a constant target for assassination attempts, one of which occurred inside the Winter Palace itself. This attempt on the Tsar's life was organized by a group known as [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya (Will of the People)]] and led by an "unsmiling fanatic", [[Andrei Zhelyabov]], and his [[mistress (lover)|mistress]] [[Sophia Perovskaya]], who later became his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Perovskaya, the daughter of a former Governor of Saint Petersburg, was well placed to learn information concerning happenings within the palace and through her connections learnt of repairs being carried out in the palace's basement.&lt;ref name="Cowles209" /&gt; One of the group, a trained carpenter, was subsequently enrolled as one of the workmen. Every day he carried dynamite charges concealed amongst his tools, placing them beneath the private dining room. So great was the quantity of dynamite that the fact there was an intervening floor between the dining room and the basement was of no significance.&lt;ref name=Cowles209&gt;Cowles, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Plans were made to detonate the bomb on the evening of {{OldStyleDate|17 February|1880|5 February}}, assassinating the Tsar and Imperial family as they dined. Fortunately for the Romanovs, a guest arriving from Berlin was delayed, and for the first time in years dinner was delayed.&lt;ref name=Cowles209/&gt; As the family left the drawing room for the dining room the bomb exploded. So great was the explosion that it could be heard all over Saint Petersburg. The dining room was completely demolished and 11 members of the [[Finnish Guard]] in the Guard Room below were killed and a further 30 wounded.&lt;ref name=Cowles209/&gt; The incident represents one of the first uses of a [[time bomb]] for political purposes. The ''New York Times'' (March 4, 1880) reported "the dynamite used was inclosed in an iron box, and exploded by a system of clockwork used by the man [[Alexander Keith, Jr.|Thomas]] in Bremen some years ago."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite book|last=Larabee|first=Ann|title=The Dynamite Fiend: The Chilling Tale of a Confederate Spy, Con Artist, and Mass Murderer|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|date=2005|isbn=9781403967947}}, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881, the revolutionaries were finally successful and Alexander II was assassinated as his carriage drove through the streets of Saint Petersburg. The Winter Palace was never truly inhabited again. The new Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] was informed by his security advisers that it was impossible to make the Winter Palace secure.&lt;ref name=Cowles216&gt;Cowles, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; The Imperial Family then moved to the seclusion of the [[Palace of Gatchina]], some {{convert|40|mi|km}} from Saint Petersburg. By comparison with the Winter Palace, the 600 room, moated Gatchina Palace, set within forests, was a cosy family home.&lt;ref name=Cowles216/&gt; When in Saint Petersburg, the Imperial Family resided at the [[Anichkov Palace]], while the Winter Palace was used for official functions. Large economies were made in food and wine. The Tsar was highly interested in the running costs of the Palace, insisting that table linen was not to be changed daily, and that candles and soap were not replaced until completely spent. Even the number of eggs used in an omelette was reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Tsar economised on household expenses, he added to the Imperial art collection of both the palace and the Hermitage. Officially, the Hermitage Museum had an annual buying allowance of 5,000 rubles, but when this proved insufficient the Tsar would himself purchase items for the museum.&lt;ref name="The State Hermitage Museum" /&gt;

Empress [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)]], the wife of Alexander III, saw that a garden was laid out in the centre of the main courtyard in 1885, an area previously cobbled and lacking vegetation. Court architect [[Nikolai Gornostayev]] designed a garden surrounded by a granite plinth and a fountain, and planted trees in the courtyard, laying limestone pavements along the walls of the palace.&lt;ref name="The State Hermitage Museum Romanovs"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_7_3.html|title= The Last Romanovs |publisher=State Hermitage Museum|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, Alexander III was succeeded by his son [[Nicholas II]]. The last Tsar suspended court mourning for his father to marry his wife [[Alix of Hesse]] in a lavish ceremony at the Winter palace.&lt;ref&gt;Kurth, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the ceremony the newlywed couple retired to the Anichkov Palace, along with the Dowager Empress. There they began their married life in six small rooms.&lt;ref name="Massie1967,61"&gt;Massie 1967, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, Nicholas and Alexandra established themselves at the [[Alexander Palace]] at [[Tsarskoe Selo]]. This was to be their favoured home for the remainder of the reign. However, from December 1895 they did reside for periods during the winter at the Winter Palace. Architect [[Alexander Krasovsky]] was commissioned to redecorate a suite of rooms in the north-west corner of the palace, including the Gothic library.&lt;ref name="VarshavskiĭRest1985"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Varshavskiĭ|first1=Sergeĭ Petrovich|last2=Rest|first2=B.|title=The ordeal of the Hermitage: the siege of Leningrad, 1941–1944|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WsWfAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=13 April 2011|year=1985|publisher=Aurora Art Publishers|isbn=978-0-8109-1406-3|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896, the wife of Nicholas II was credited for the creation of another garden (35) on the former parade ground, beneath the windows of the Imperial Family's private apartments. She had found it disconcerting that the public could stare into her windows. The garden was created by [[landscape architect]] [[Georg Kuphaldt]], the director of the [[Riga]] city gardens and parks.&lt;ref name="kavere"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Kāvere| first = Anne| title =Rīgas dārzu arhitekts Georgs Kūfalts.| language = Latvian| publisher=Jumava| location = Riga| pages = 107–108| year = 2007| oclc = 191090541| isbn = 978-9984-38-349-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is only one of [[Gardens of the Winter Palace|two gardens]] which remain today at the palace.

During the reign of Nicholas II, court life was quieter than it had ever been, due to the Tsaritsa's retiring nature and mistrust of Saint Petersburg's high society.&lt;ref name="Cowles, p247"&gt;Cowles, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Empress' opinion: "Saint Petersburg is a rotten town, and not one atom Russian."&lt;ref&gt;Radziwill, pp 158–59&lt;/ref&gt; Under her influence, gradually the great court receptions and balls at the Winter Palace, which humoured and cultivated the powerful nobility, came to an end. They were briefly replaced by theatricals held in the Hermitage which "no one enjoyed",&lt;ref name="Cowles, p247" /&gt; then even the theatricals ceased.&lt;ref name="Cowles, p247" /&gt;

The final great Imperial gathering at the Winter Palace was a themed fancy dress ball celebrating the reign of [[Alexis I of Russia|Alexei I]], which took place on 11 and 13 February 1903 ([[1903 Ball in the Winter Palace]]). Grand Duke [[Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia|Alexander Mikhailovich]] recalled the occasion as "the last spectacular ball in the history of the empire...[but] a new and hostile Russia glared through the large windows of the palace...while we danced, the workers were striking and the clouds in the Far East were hanging dangerously low."&lt;ref&gt;Maylunas, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire Imperial family, the Tsar as Alexei I, the Empress as [[Maria Miloslavskaya]], all dressed in rich 17th century attire, posed in the Hermitage's theatre, many wearing priceless original items brought specially from the [[Kremlin]],&lt;ref&gt;Maylunas, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; for what was to be their final photograph together.&lt;ref&gt;Kurth, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, Russia was at [[Russo-Japanese War|war with Japan]], and the newborn [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Tsarevich]] was secretly ill; the Tsar and the Empress permanently abandoned Saint Petersburg, the Winter Palace, and high society (considered by the Empress to be decadent and immoral&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;) for the greater comfort, security and privacy of Tsarskoe Selo. Thus it was that the Winter Palace, designed and intended to impress, reflect and reinforce the Romanovs' power, lost its [[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]] over a decade before the fall of the dynasty it was intended to house and glorify.

===Fall of the House of Romanov (1905–1918)===

[[File:Nicholas II of Russia painted by Earnest Lipgart.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Nicholas II, last Tsar of all the Russias, in the [[Nicholas Hall of the Winter Palace|Nicholas Hall]]. Portrait by [[Earnest Lipgart]], early 1900s.]]
Following the Imperial Family's move to the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoe Selo,&lt;ref&gt;Kurth, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; the Winter Palace became little more than an administrative office block and a place of rare official entertaining. Throughout the year, the family moved from one palace to another: in March, to [[Livadia Palace|Livadia]]; in May to [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]] (not the great palace, but a 19th-century villa in its grounds); in June, they cruised upon the Imperial Yacht, [[Standart (yacht)|Standart]]; August was spent in Poland, at [[Spala]], September was spent back at Livadia, before a return to Tsarskoe Selo for the Winter.&lt;ref name=Massie1967,69&gt;Massie 1967, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tsar betrayed his private views of Saint Petersburg in 1912, while addressing a farewell party of dignitaries and family bidding him farewell, as the family left for warmer climes: "I am only sorry for you who have to remain in this bog."&lt;ref name=Massie1967,69/&gt; However, to the Tsar's ordinary subjects, the Winter Palace was seen not only as the home of the Tsars, but a symbol of Imperial power. In this role, it was to be at the centre of some of the most momentous happenings in Russia's early 20th century history. Three of these events stand out in Russia's history: The Bloody Sunday massacre of 1905; the opening of the first State Duma in 1906, which opened in St George's Hall (13); and finally the taking of the palace by revolutionaries in 1917.

The Bloody Sunday massacre was a result of the public ignorance of the Tsar's place of residence. It occurred on {{OldStyleDate|22 January|1905|9 January}} during a demonstration march by workers toward the Winter Palace.   The closest shootings of demonstrators occurred near St. Isaac's Cathedral at the entrance to the Aleksandr Gardens leading to the Palace Square in front of the Winter Palace. The massacre was sparked when a Russian Orthodox priest and popular working class leader, [[George Gapon|Father Gapon]], announced his intention to lead a peaceful protest of 100,000 unarmed striking workers to present a petition to the Tsar, to call for fundamental reforms and the founding of a constituent parliament.&lt;ref name=Kurth78&gt;Kurth, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters were unaware that the palace was little more than an uninhabited icon of Imperial power, and that the Tsar no longer resided there. The Tsar was not informed of the planned protest until the evening before, while no suggestion was made that the Tsar should meet a deputation or send representative to accept the petition.&lt;ref name=Kurth78/&gt; Instead, the Minister for the Interior drafted additional troops. As the strikers neared the palace bearing religious icons and singing the Imperial anthem, the Tsar's troops opened fire. While the number of casualties is disputed, moderate estimates average around 1,000 men, women and children killed or injured. The massacre, which came to be known as Bloody Sunday, was a serious blunder on the part of the [[Okhrana]] and was to have grave consequences for the Tsarist regime. It was also to be the catalyst for the [[Russian Revolution (1905)|1905 Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Kurth, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vorres, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Subsequently, little changed politically in Russia during this period, and the Winter Palace remained in darkness. In 1913 the Romanov dynasty celebrated its [[300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty|tercentenary]], but the crowds that flocked to see the processions were thin, the Empress appeared unhappy and the heir sick. The Tsar and Empress declined to hold a celebratory ball at the Winter Palace, instead holding two small receptions, both of which the Empress failed to attend.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, Russia was forced to go to [[World War I|war]] as a result of the [[Triple Entente|Triple Entente Alliance]]. The Tsar and Empress briefly returned to the Winter Palace to stand on their balcony to accept salutes and homage from the departing troops. Ironically, unlike the monarchs of Europe who stood on balconies adorned with velvet, flanked by their families, the Tsar and Empress stood, alone, in one corner of an unadorned balcony, appearing almost lost next to an oversized Imperial emblem, soon to be torn down by their own subjects. As the departing troops saluted their monarch in front of the palace, plans were being drawn up to store the palace's contents and convert the state rooms into a hospital to receive returning troops.
[[File:Romanovs on Balcony.jpg|thumb|250px|right|In 1914, the Tsar and Empress bless their troops from the balcony of the Winter Palace.]]
In the initial stages of the war, Russia endured heavy losses at the [[First Battle of the Masurian Lakes|Masurian Lakes]] and [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Tannenberg]] and it was to the Winter Palace that many of the wounded returned. Rechristened the Tsarevich Alexey Nikolayevich Hospital, from October 1915, the palace was a fully equipped hospital, its staterooms transformed into hospital wards. The Fieldmarshals' Hall became a dressing station, the Armorial Hall an operating theatre. The small throne room became a doctor's mess room, while more lowly staff were accommodated in the Nicholas Hall and the Anteroom. Nurses were housed in the more intimate apartments once reserved for members of the extended Romanov family. The 1812 Gallery became a store room, the vestibule of the Jordan staircase the hospital's canteen, and its landings offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_1_31.html |title=1914: Start of World War I.

[[File:Winterpalace1914hosp.jpg|thumb|250px|left|1915, the Nicholas Hall, transformed to a hospital ward.]]
As the war went badly for Russia, its catastrophes were reflected in Saint Petersburg. The Tsar had decided to lead from the front, leaving the Empress to effectively rule Russia from Tsarskoe Selo. It was an unpopular move with both the Tsar's subjects and the Romanov family, as the Empress hired and fired indiscriminately often, it was supposed, on the advice of her favourite, [[Rasputin]]. Following Rasputin's murder by the Tsar's nephew-in-law in December 1916, the Empress' decisions and appointments became more erratic and the situation worsened and Saint Petersburg fell into the full grip of revolution.

Forced to accept the hopelessness of both the war and the situation at home, on 15 March 1917, Nicholas II abdicated in favour of his brother, [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Mikhail Alexandrovich]]. The Grand Duke promptly refused to accept the throne without the support of the army and his people. A [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional Government]] was appointed and many members of the former Imperial family were arrested, including the former Tsar, the Empress and their children. No member of the Romanov family have lived in the Winter Palace since the abdication in 1917 and very rarely did after 1905. Nicholas II, his wife and children were all held in captivity until they were murdered at [[Yekaterinburg]] in 1918. Other members of the former Imperial Family either met similar fates or escaped into exile.

==The Seat of the Provisional Government (1917)==
{{Main|Russian Revolution}}
[[File:Zimní palác (3).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Rastrelli's Neva facade upon which ''[[Russian cruiser Aurora|Aurora]]'' trained her guns]]
It was this turbulent period of Russian history, known as the [[February Revolution]], which for a brief time saw the Winter Palace re-established as a seat of government and focal point of the former Russian Empire. In February 1917, the [[Russian Provisional Government]], led by [[Alexander Kerensky]], based itself in the north west corner of the palace with the [[Malachite Room of the Winter Palace|Malachite Room]] ''(4)'' being the chief council chamber. Most of the state rooms were, however, still occupied by the military hospital.

It was to be a short occupation of both palace and power. By 25 October 1917, the Provisional Government was failing and, realising the palace was a target for the more militant [[Bolshevik]]s, ordered its defence.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1917/dec/27/russia.fromthearchive |title=How the Bolsheviks took the Winter Palace|work=The Guardian |location=UK (eyewitness account of the storming of the Winter Palace)|accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All military personnel in the city pledged support to the Bolsheviks, who accused Kerensky's Government of wishing to "surrender Petrograd to the Germans so as to enable them to exterminate the revolutionary garrison."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

Thus the provisional government, assisted by a few remaining loyal servants, who had formerly served the Tsar, barricaded themselves in the palace.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; Many of the administrative staff fled, leaving the palace severely under-defended allegedly by some [[Cossack]]s, [[Cadet]]s, and 137 female soldiers from the [[Women's Battalion]]. Food ordered by the occupants of the palace was commandeered by the Bolsheviks, and, in a state of siege, the Winter Palace entered the most turbulent period in its history. According to Soviet history, five thousand sailors newly arrived from [[Kronstadt]] were deployed to attack the palace, while the cruiser ''[[Russian cruiser Aurora|Aurora]]''  positioned itself on the Neva, all its guns trained towards the Palace. Across the water, the Bolsheviks captured the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] and turned its [[artillery]] towards the besieged building. As the provisional Government, now impotent, hid in the private rooms of the former Imperial Family, nervously surveying the scenes outside,&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;  one by one the Government buildings in Palace Square surrendered to the Bolsheviks,&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; leaving the palace seemingly only hours from destruction.

At 7:00&amp;nbsp;pm, the Government held its last meeting in the Malachite Room, with the telephone and all contact with the outside world disconnected.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; A short debate determined that they would not leave the palace to attempt dialogue with the hostile crowds outside. With the palace completely surrounded and sealed, the Aurora began her bombardment of the great Neva façade as the Government refused an ultimatum to surrender. Further [[machine gun]] and light artillery fire were directed at the palace as the Bolsheviks gained entry via His Majesty's own Staircase ''(36)''. In the ensuing battle there were casualties on both sides until the Bolsheviks finally, by 2:00&amp;nbsp;am, had control of the palace. Leaving a trail of destruction, they searched room after room before arresting the Provisional Government in the [[Private Apartments of the Winter Palace|Small Dining Room]] of the private apartment ''(28)'', from where they were taken to imprisonment in the Fortress across the river. Kerensky managed to evade arrest and escape to [[Pskov]], where he rallied some loyal troops for an attempt to retake the capital. His troops managed to capture [[Tsarskoe Selo]], but were beaten the next day at [[Pulkovo Heights|Pulkovo]].

[[File:Malachite Room by Konstantin Ukhtomsky.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The [[Malachite Room of the Winter Palace|Malachite Room]], seat of the Provisional Government, who were arrested in the adjoining Private Dining Room. Painting by Konstantin Ukhtomsky]]
Following the Government's arrest, an alleged eye witness account by an unnamed source records that the Bolsheviks began rampaging:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "The Palace was pillaged and devastated from top to bottom by the Bolshevik[s]...Priceless pictures were ripped from their frames by bayonets. Packed boxes of rare plate and china...were broken open and the contents smashed or carried off. The library....was forced open and ransacked.....the Tsaritsa's salon, like all other rooms, was thrown into chaos. The colossal crystal lustre, with its artfully concealed music, was smashed to atoms. Desks, pictures, ornaments—everything was destroyed."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Winter Palace's wine cellars literally fuelled the weeks of looting and unrest in the city which followed. Arguably the largest and best stocked wine cellar in history,&lt;ref name="Figes1998"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Figes|first=Orlando|title=A people's tragedy: the Russian Revolution, 1891–1924|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CSsGW-NqYVgC|accessdate=13 April 2011|date=March 1998|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-024364-2|page=494}}&lt;/ref&gt; it contained the world's finest vintages, including the Tsar's favourite, and priceless, [[Chateau de Calme|Chateau d’Yquem 1847]].&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orlandofiges.co.uk/aPeoplesTragedybyorlandofiges.php|author=Figes, Orlando|title=Storming the Palace|publisher=Cambridge University, PBS|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; So keen were the mob to obtain the alcohol, that the Bolsheviks explored radical solutions to the problem, one of which involved piping the wine straight out into the Neva. This led to crowds clustering around the palace drains. Another proposal, deemed too risky, was exploding the cellars. Eventually, the problem was solved by the declaration of martial law. It has been said that Petrograd, "perhaps with the biggest hangover in history, finally woke up and got back to some order."&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;

The Winter Palace was now a redundant and damaged building symbolic of a despised regime, facing an uncertain future. ''[[The Storming of the Winter Palace]]'' was a [[historical reenactment]] organised by the Bolsheviks on the 3rd anniversary in 1920. With thousands of Red Guards led by Lenin, and witnessed by 100,000 spectators, the reenactment has become one of the "best known" events of the Russian Revolution.

Ironically, the Red Guard actually broke into the palace through a back door that was left open, guarded by wounded and disabled reserves. This gave rise to the occasion being described as the birth of the Soviet state.&lt;ref&gt;Explorations in Saint Petersburg.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikolai Podvoisky]], one of the original [[Troika (triumvirate)|troika]], which led the original storming, was so impressed by the re-enactment that he commissioned [[Sergei Eisenstein]] to make his film ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World|October]]''. Certain features, such as the banks of floodlights which appear in Eisenstein's film indicate that Eisenstein was more influenced by the re-enactment than the original event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.escholarship.org/editions/view?docId=ft467nb2w4&amp;chunk.id=d0e44&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress Bolshevik Festivals, 1917–1920] by James Von Geldern accessed 5 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Richard.

On 30 October 1917, the palace was declared to be part of the Hermitage public museums. This first exhibition to be held in the Winter Palace concerned the history of the revolution, and the public were able to view the private rooms of the Imperial Family.&lt;ref name="The State Hermitage Museum" /&gt; This must have been an interesting experience for the viewing public, for while Soviet authorities denied looting and damage to the palace during the Storming, the Russian art connoisseur [[Alexander Alexandrovich Polovtsov, junior|Alexander Alexandrovich Polovtsov]], who visited these rooms immediately before and after the event, described the [[Private Apartments of the Winter Palace|private apartments]] as the most badly damaged area of the palace.&lt;ref&gt;Faber, p158&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of the state rooms had been sent to Moscow for safety when the hospital was established, and the Hermitage Museum itself had not been damaged during the revolution.

Following the Revolution, there was a policy of removing all Imperial emblems from the palace, including those on the stonework, plaster-work and iron work.&lt;ref name="Brown1976"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brown|first=Douglas|title=Doomsday 1917: the destruction of Russia's ruling class|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w90ZAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=13 April 2011|year=1976|publisher=Putnam|isbn=978-0-399-11615-5|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Soviet era, many of the palace's remaining treasures were dispersed around the museums and galleries of the Soviet Union. Some were sold for hard currency while others were given away to visiting dignitaries. As the original contents disappeared and other items from sequestered collections began to be displayed in the palace, the distinctions between the rooms' original and later use have become blurred. While some rooms have retained their original names, and some even the trappings of Imperial Russia, such as the furnishings of the Small and Large Throne Rooms, many other rooms are known by the names of their new contents, such as The Room of German Art.

Following the 1941–1944 [[Siege of Leningrad]], when the palace was damaged, a restoration policy was enacted, which has fully restored the palace.&lt;ref name=Budberg201/&gt; Furthermore, as the Russian Government does not categorically shun remnants of the Imperial Era as was the case during Soviet rule, the palace has since had the emblems of the Romanovs restored. The gilded and crowned double headed eagles once more adorn the walls, balconies and gates. The Winter Palace is no longer the hub of a great empire, and the Romanovs no longer reside there, but the crowned Russian eagle serves as a reminder of the palace's Imperial history.

Today, as part of one of the world's best known museums, the palace attracts an annual 3.5&amp;nbsp;million visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stpetersburg2003.ch/about/index.php?lang=eng&amp;|title=St Petersburg: Swiss Architecture on the Neva (Domenico Trezzini 1727)|publisher=Presence Switzerland, Berne, Switzerland|accessdate=11 November 2008|page=4|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216150025/http://www.stpetersburg2003.ch/about/index.php?lang=eng&amp;|archive-date=16 December 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Women's Caucus for Art Lifetime Achievement Award''' was established under the presidency of Lee Ann Miller (1978–80). [[Joan Mondale]], artist and wife of vice-president [[Walter Mondale]], helped to secure approval for a national award honoring women's achievements in the arts, and [[Jimmy Carter]] presided over the first [[Women's Caucus for Art]] award ceremony in the Oval Office in 1980.&lt;ref name="Dickinson"&gt;Eleanor Dickinson, [http://www.nationalwca.org/wcadocs/TheHistory%20of%20the%20WCA.pdf The History of the Women's Caucus for Art].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4974">'''You can click, but you can't hide''' is a propaganda campaign run jointly by several international associations, most notably the [[Motion Picture Association|MPA]], the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]], and the [[Gesellschaft zur Verfolgung von Urheberrechtsverletzungen e.V.|GVU]], as part of the larger ''"Respect Copyrights"'' campaign against [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]] of [[motion pictures]]. The associations have long alleged that Internet file sharing, or maintaining a file sharing tracker, network or [[search engine]], constitutes [[copyright infringement]] because the practice hurts their profits.

The phrase is an adaptation of the phrase "You can run but you can't hide," a statement attributed to American boxer [[Joe Louis]]. The "Illegal Downloading: Inappropriate for all ages" campaign logo is based on the [[MPAA]] Rating System logos.

In addition to a print and [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] campaign, [[BitTorrent tracker]] websites closed between October 2004 and May 2005 due to legal action by the associations have replaced their front page with the campaign's logo and an accompanying message:

''There are websites that provide legal downloads. This is not one of them. This website has been permanently shut down by court order because it facilitates the illegal downloading of copyrighted motion pictures. The illegal downloading of motion pictures robs thousands of honest, hard-working people of their livelihood, and stifles creativity. Illegally downloading movies from sites such as these without proper authorization violates the law, is theft, and is not anonymous. Stealing movies leaves a trail. The only way not to get caught is to stop.''

==LokiTorrent controversy==
The associations have also obtained records from some closed tracker sites, which could be used to trace individual users. The administrator of one such site, [[LokiTorrent]], closed the site and turned over its logs, amidst controversy, as part of a settlement ending a 2005 copyright infringement lawsuit filed by MPAA studios against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4256449.stm |title=Movie body hits peer-to-peer nets |work=[[BBC News]] |date=11 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-[[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|"piracy"]] campaign's signature replaced the content of the website upon its shutting down.&lt;ref name="m"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lokitorrent.com/ |title=MPAA notice on LokiTorrent website |accessdate=February 10, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050210215106/http://www.lokitorrent.com/ |archivedate=February 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arresting nature of the graphics, and the use of scare tactics in this campaign is a marked difference from previous large-scale copyright-promotion campaigns such as [[Home Taping is Killing Music]] and [[Who Makes Movies?]], which appealed to the consumer's interest in the art form and the consumer's compassion for movie industry workers. John G. Malcolm, former Senior Vice President and Director of Worldwide Anti-Piracy for the MPAA, has been quoted saying that the goal of the campaign is to "make an example of" internet movie thieves and other pirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawdit.co.uk/reading_room/room/view_article.asp?name=../articles/MPAA%20you%20can%20click%20but%20you%20cant%20hide.htm|title=Motion Picture Association of America enforces its message 'you can click but you can't hide}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former MPAA chief Dan Glickman insisted in a statement to film [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] traders that the MPAA "will find you, and you will be held responsible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/68741|title=MPAA Sues Three|date=21 Oct 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Update on campaign==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
In 2010 they conducted survey and found out as the years progressed more and more people continued to find more ways and websites to download illegal music. Troels Møller from pro-[[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|"piracy"]] group [[:da:Piratgruppen|Piratgruppen]] stated, "The advertising campaigns used to prevent illegal downloads have been a waste of money and have in general been a cop-out from the record industry". He believes that these campaigns are useless and have no real major effect on the daily consumer of music. This scare tactic is not a significant factor and has little to no success for music listeners.
