      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3596">'''ArtWatch International''' was founded by [[James Beck (art historian)|James Beck]], [[professor]] of [[art history]] at [[Columbia University]], to monitor, and campaign for better practices in, the conservation of art works. The United Kingdom branch, '''ArtWatch UK''', is run by Michael Daley.

==Activities==

In 1991, Beck criticised the cleaning of [[Jacopo della Quercia]]'s sculpture, the tomb of Ilaria del Carretto in [[Lucca]] cathedral in [[Italy]].  As a result, the conservator sued him for "aggravated slander", which carries a possible three-year prison sentence. Beck won the case and subsequently co-founded ArtWatch.&lt;ref name=memoriam&gt;"In Memoriam", ''The Art Newspaper'', July/August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

ArtWatch has been critical of many conservation practices and projects, including the restoration of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|''The Last Supper'']] and the [[restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes]]. In 2004, it raised an unsuccessful petition to halt the restoration of [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', which has since been found to be developing cracks.

ArtWatch UK have included a commemorative issue on the late James Beck; a report on the damage to artworks in transit for blockbuster exhibitions; and articles critical of the results of restorations on modern painters like [[Gustav Klimt]]. The November 2008 ArtWatch UK journal contained 20 articles campaigning about developments in the UNESCO-protected city of [[Saint Petersburg]].

Beck was, and Daley is, frequently outspoken and their opinions on recent restorations have been covered regularly by the press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukic.org.uk/members/news.html ukic.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artwatchinternational.org/db_images/pdfs/RaphaelPinksTimes19Oct2004.mht artwatchinternational.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231025337/http://www.artwatchinternational.org/db_images/pdfs/RaphaelPinksTimes19Oct2004.mht |date=December 31, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they have been equally strongly opposed by those they criticise. The Surveyor of the Fabric of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]], who oversaw a 2004 cleaning of the cathedral that came under fire by Daley, retorted that "ArtWatch UK sounds very grand, but seems to be the view of one person."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-7-1139770,00.html ''The Times'']&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation of the  restoration campaign had been conducted and written by art historian, Florence Hallett.{{citation needed|date=November 2008}}

==Ludwig Burchard==
In April 2006 the ArtWatch UK Journal published research into Ludwig Burchard, a scholar who had made many attributions to [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]. This showed that Burchard had been prepared to make false attributions for commercial gain. It again called into question the authenticity of the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]]'s ''[[Samson and Delilah (Rubens)|Samson and Delilah]]''—and the integrity of the then director [[Neil MacGregor]]. The research was conducted by Dr. [[Kasia Pisarek]].

{{International opposition to Apartheid}}
'''Artists United Against Apartheid''' was a 1985 protest group founded by [[activism|activist]] and performer [[Steven Van Zandt]] and record producer [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]] to protest [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]].   The group produced the song "[[Sun City (song)|Sun City]]" and the album ''[[Sun City (album)|Sun City]]'' that year, which is considered a notable [[Music in the movement against apartheid|anti-apartheid song]].&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite web|author=Times LIVE |url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/entertainment/music/2014/04/28/seven-great-anti-apartheid-songs-videos |title=Seven great anti-apartheid songs: Videos |publisher=Times LIVE |date= |accessdate=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/dec/05/entertainment/la-et-ms-nelson-mandela-dies-music-ten-essential-antiapartheid-songs-20130627 |title=Nelson Mandela and music: Ten essential anti-Apartheid songs - latimes |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=December 5, 2013 |accessdate=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sun City==

[[Sun City, North West|Sun City]] was a place where the South African government allowed entertainment that was banned in most
of the country.  In protest of apartheid, an international boycott by performers continued for years, although some, such as [[Queen (band)|Queen]], ignored it.

==Writing and recording==
Van Zandt became interested in writing a song about Sun City to make parallels with the plight of Native Americans. [[Danny Schechter]], a journalist who was then working with [[ABC News]]' ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]'', suggested turning the song into a different  kind of "[[We Are the World]]", or as Schechter explains, "a song about change not charity, freedom not famine."{{ref}}

When Van Zandt was finished writing "[[Sun City (song)|Sun City]]", he, Schechter and producer Arthur Baker spent the next several months searching for artists to participate in the project. Van Zandt initially declined to invite Springsteen, not wanting to take advantage of their friendship, but Schechter had no problem asking and Springsteen accepted the invitation. Van Zandt was also shy about calling legendary jazz artist [[Miles Davis]]. Schechter initiated the contact and Davis also accepted. Eventually, Van Zandt, Baker and Schechter would gather an array of artists, described by rock critic [[Dave Marsh]] as "the most diverse line up of popular musicians ever assembled for a single session"&lt;ref&gt;[[Dave Marsh|Marsh, Dave]] &amp; Bernard, James (1994) New Book of Rock Lists Fireside 1230 Avenue of the Americas, New York NY 10020 {{ISBN|0-671-78700-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, including [[Kool DJ Herc]], [[Grandmaster Melle Mel]], [[Ruben Blades]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Pat Benatar]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Ringo Starr]] and his son [[Zak Starkey]],  [[Lou Reed]], [[Run–D.M.C.]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Bob Geldof]], [[Clarence Clemons]], [[David Ruffin]], [[Eddie Kendricks]], [[Darlene Love]], [[Bobby Womack]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]], [[Kurtis Blow]], [[The Fat Boys]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[Daryl Hannah]], [[Peter Wolf]], [[Bono]], [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Ronnie Wood]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Hall &amp; Oates]], [[Jimmy Cliff]], [[Big Youth]], [[Michael Monroe]], [[Stiv Bators]], [[Peter Garrett]], [[Ron Carter]], [[Ray Barretto]], [[Gil Scott-Heron]], [[Nona Hendryx]], [[Kashif]], [[Lotti Golden]],  [[Lakshminarayana Shankar]] and [[Joey Ramone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/sun-city-artists-united-against-apartheid-mw0000200232/credits|title=Sun City: Artists United Against Apartheid - Various Artists / Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate= September 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These artists also vowed never to perform at Sun City, because to do so would in their minds seem to be an acceptance of apartheid.

Schechter had also taken on the job of documenting the sessions on video and producing a behind-the-scenes documentary, working with 16&amp;nbsp;mm crews and independent production companies, directed by [[Jonathan Demme]].  Paul "Lucky" Goldberg, director, producer and cinematographer for ThunderVision Media Ltd and president of Hollywood New York International since 1993, worked with producer and partner Paul Allen of ThunderVision Media Ltd, based in New York at [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] to capture the action. Lucky and Paul introduced a new camera technology to work alongside the 16mm crews, the one-piece camera  - [[Panasonic]]'s Recam format for extensive handheld coverage of two days of the artists in the streets of Manhattan as well as a rendition of "Sun City" in [[Washington Square Park]].  Approximately 150 policemen surrounded the entire park on horseback and foot to secure the area for the performance, which included Van Zandt, [[Bono]], Springsteen, [[the Fat Boys]], [[Mötley Crüe]], Afrika Bambaataa, Nona Hendryx and many others.  One of the most notable shots was caught when Bono gave a huge kiss on the cheek to one of the Fat Boys, in his signature yellow satin jacket and red hat.  They went on to shoot Sun City II in [[Central Park]], capturing the politics and music of the spirit of Little Steven's award-winning "Sun City", including interviews with Peter Gabriel and Bono.

Schechter invited [[MTV]] to get involved and asked a friend, Hart Perry, to film the sessions. During the course of the film, Schechter asks the artists to explain their involvement in the project in their own words: "Sun City's become a symbol of a society which  is very oppressive and denies basic rights to the majority of its citizens," said Jackson Browne. "In a sense, Sun City is also a symbol of that society's 'right' to entertain itself in any way that it wants to, to basically try to buy us off and to buy off world opinion."  Recalls Schechter, "I was surprised that many of the best-known rock 'n rollers were so publicity shy. Most of them had publicists who staged their media appearances. They weren't used to cameras poking them in the face. Bruce Springsteen at first turned down my request for an interview, but just as I was walking away from him dejected, he ran after me and agreed to say a few words for the documentary.

"When Miles started improvising in the studio...Steven and [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur [Baker]]] insisted I not approach him with a camera. 'It's Miles, man," Baker said.  "He's erratic, idiosyncratic, explosive. Wild. Don't mess with him when he's playing...' I barged into the booth while Davis was setting up, introduced myself and asked if we could  videotape him. Through the glass I could see Steve and Arthur, heads in hands, convinced that I had blown it. Miles smiled. 'Bring it on,' he ordered, 'bring it on.' And we did, getting priceless footage in the bargain."

In addition to "Sun City," a number of other songs were recorded, making up the album ''[[Sun City (album)|Sun City]]''.

==Release==
For a time Van Zandt and Baker were making the record without a record company or any  outside financial support. Van Zandt financed much of it while producer [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]] (notable for his work with [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[New Order (band)|New Order]]) donated studio time. Manhattan Records, under Bruce Lundvall's direction, came on board, acquiring rights to the recording and enabling Van Zandt and Baker to pay some of the bills. A committed record company attorney, the late Rick Dutka, also donated his time, along with noted music industry attorney, the late Owen Epstein as well as Van Zandt's assistant, Zoë Yanakis. Also, some New York's top recording engineers, studio musicians and recording studios donated their time as well as the artists who participated in recording Sun City. As well as lead vocals provided by notable artists [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Bono]], [[Darlene Love]], [[Run DMC]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Eddie Kendricks]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Nona Hendryx]] and others, the signature background vocal sound was created by [[Lotti Golden]], B.J.Nelson and Tina B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Artists-United-Against-Apartheid-Sun-City/release/5991679|title=Artists United Against Apartheid - Sun City|website=[[Discogs]]|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Schechter's connections with ABC News posed some risks. "I couldn't tell ABC what I was doing on the side," recalls Schechter. "They  would not have approved. I knew I couldn't propose a story about Sun City either, because  I had stepped over the line and become part of the story. I tried and mostly succeeded in keeping my name out of the papers and my mug out of the video. I was terrified that [[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]] would dump me if they knew what I was doing, especially if my affiliation with ABC was dragged into it, even though the network had nothing to do with the project. I worked even harder at ABC, producing more stories than many of my colleagues, so I couldn't be accused of slacking off." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40759595|title=The more you watch, the less you know : news wars/(sub)merged hopes/media adventures|last=Danny |first=Schechter |date=1999|publisher=Seven Stories Press|isbn=1888363800|edition=Rev. and updated|location=New York|oclc=40759595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==

===Song===
The song "Sun City" was only a modest success in the US, reaching #38 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot 100 chart in December 1985. Only about half of American radio stations played "Sun City,"{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} with some objecting to the lyrics' explicit criticism of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s policy of "[[constructive engagement]]."

Meanwhile, "Sun City" was a major success in countries where there was little or no radio station resistance to the record or its messages, reaching [[Kent Music Report|#4]] in Australia, [[RPM (magazine)|#10]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&amp;file_num=nlc008388.0625&amp;volume=43&amp;issue=18&amp;issue_dt=January%2025%201986&amp;type=1&amp;interval=24&amp;PHPSESSID=c4ao5klg6bn7uptptp2uf0tvt2 | title=Top Singles | journal=[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] | year=January 25, 1986 | volume=43 | issue=18 | publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011092534/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&amp;file_num=nlc008388.0625&amp;volume=43&amp;issue=18&amp;issue_dt=January%2025%201986&amp;type=1&amp;interval=24&amp;PHPSESSID=c4ao5klg6bn7uptptp2uf0tvt2 | archivedate= October 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Canada and [[UK Singles Chart|#21]] in the UK.&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book

The song was banned in South Africa.

===Documentary===
Van Zandt and Schechter also struggled to get the documentary seen. [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) refused to broadcast the [[non-profit]] film [http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2zheo_lou-reed-little-stevie-making-of-su_travel "The Making of Sun City"] even though it won the [[International Documentary Association]]'s top honors in 1986; PBS claimed the featured artists were also involved in making the film and were therefore "self-promoting."{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} (In contrast, PBS chose to broadcast ''The Making of "[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]"'', which was made as a promotional exercise by the for-profit [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Lucasfilm|Lucasfilm Ltd.]]) In 1987, [[WNYC-TV]], the New York City-owned [[public television]] station, aired an updated version of the documentary, produced by filmmaker [[Bill Lichtenstein]] along with Schechter. The film included updates about the Sun City resort and apartheid as well as the success of the Sun City video. In addition to airing the documentary, WNYC-TV made the film available over the PBS system to public television stations across the country for broadcast.

===Overall impact===
The album and single raised more than a million U.S. dollars for anti-apartheid projects. It premiered at the [[United Nations]], thanks to the Special Committee Against Apartheid and UN officers such as [[Aracelly Santana]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

The record never achieved the financial success of "[[We Are the World]]," although [[Oliver Tambo]] and the ANC's school in [[Tanzania]] "was sure happy when we gave them a big check," according to Schechter.

In South Africa, "Sun City" would later inspire musician [[Johnny Clegg]] to create a local organization similar to Van Zandt's, and "Sun City" also became the catalyst for the ''South Africa Now'' TV series.

==Post-apartheid==
With the end of the apartheid regime in 1994 and the reintegration of Sun City and other former nominally-independent regions into the South African state, "Sun City" ceased to be a contemporary protest and became a historical document.

In 1997, the man who created Sun City, [[Sol Kerzner]], came to the United States to build the [[Mohegan Sun]], a Native American gambling casino.

'''Broad Universe''' is a [[United States]]-based, all volunteer organization with the primary goal of promoting [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], and [[horror fiction|horror]] written by women.  Writers, editors, publishers, reviewers, artists, and [[science fiction fandom|fans]] are invited to join them.  "Broad-minded" men are welcome to participate.  The organization originated in a panel discussion at [[WisCon]], the feminist [[science fiction convention]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], [[Wisconsin]], in 2000.  

Broad Universe created the Rapid Fire Reading with a small group of member authors who each read an excerpt from their work no more than 5 minutes long.  This has been very popular at conventions. It gives more authors an opportunity to read and it gives the audience a taste of fantastic fiction from several authors instead of just one.

Broad Universe buys dealer's tables at various conventions (genre related or publishers, librarians and other conventions of use to the members.)  One member benefit is the sale of their books at 0% commission by Broad Universe volunteers at conventions.

{{nihongo|'''Dai Heiwa Kinen Tō'''|[[:ja:大平和祈念塔|大平和祈念塔]]}}, lit. ''The Great Peace Prayer Tower'', is a [[cenotaph]] tower in [[Tondabayashi, Osaka]], [[Japan]].

== General ==
The official name of the cenotaph tower is literally {{nihongo|"non-denominational [lit.: above denominations] war victims great cenotaph tower to pray peace"|超宗派万国戦争犠牲者慰霊大平和祈念塔|Chōshūha Bankoku Sensō Giseisha irei dai heiwa kinen tō}}. The tower  is 180 m in height, white in color, and built by the [[PL Kyodan|Church of Perfect Liberty]] in August 1970.

The [[cenotaph]] is designated for the [[soul]]s of all war victims in [[history]], regardless of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[ethnic group]], [[sovereign state]], [[border]], [[region]], [[religion]], [[religious denomination]] and [[creed]]. The cenotaph is also used as a [[tomb]] for unidentified war victims.  A ceremony and memorial service, where participants pray for world peace, is held annually on 1 August.

'''Developing Lives''' is a photography program run for residents of the [[New York City Housing Authority]] or [[New York City Housing Authority|NYCHA]], a [[government agency]] that provides [[public housing]] for low and moderate residents throughout the [[Borough (New York City)|five boroughs]] of [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=Studio&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing Lives: Studio NYCHA|url=http://studionycha.org/developinglives/|publisher=NYCHA|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program provides workshops by NYCHA using privately donated film cameras and laptops along with discounted film development.&lt;ref name=Studio /&gt;  Private support of NYCHA programs is welcome given the agency experiencing huge shortfalls in operating and capital funding.&lt;ref name=Committee&gt;{{cite web|last=Committee on Public Housing|title=Testimony from NYCHA Chairman John B.

== History ==

Developing Lives began in the Housing Authority’s Manhattanville Development in fall 2010 with a handful of participants.&lt;ref name="Nguyen"/&gt; The program has by now included residents of 15 of the agency’s 334 developments. Meanwhile, over 10,000 viewers have seen the photographs online.&lt;ref name=Brochure&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing Lives Brochure|url=http://seeingforourselves.org/media/developing-lives-brochure.pdf|publisher=Seeing for Ourselves|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing Lives was brought to NYCHA by former [[New York City Transit Authority|MTA]] executive [[George Carrano]] of the non-profit [[Seeing For Ourselves]], which also arranged the private partnerships behind the program.&lt;ref name=Brochure /&gt;&lt;ref name=Team&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing Lives: Meet the Team|url=http://studionycha.org/developinglives/developing-lives-class-information/meet-the-team/|publisher=Studio NYCHA|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Carrano had served as curator of photography exhibits of war [[photojournalism]] and participatory photography that were lauded in the media as poignant&lt;ref name=Salamon&gt;{{cite news|last=Salamon|first=Julie|title=Child Photographers Show Lives of Hardship and Hope|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/10/arts/child-photographers-show-lives-of-hardship-and-hope.html|accessdate=20 August 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and not to be missed.&lt;ref name=Art&gt;{{cite news|last=The New York Time|title=Art Listings|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/30/arts/design/30art.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=20 August 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=September 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Chelsea Davis, founder of two participatory arts programs and with family roots in NYC public housing, directs the program. Lily Randall, former art instructor in St. Louis public housing, also helped run Developing Lives.&lt;ref name="Kodak Blog" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Team /&gt;

== Developing Lives as Photography ==

Developing Lives belongs to the school of participatory photography. This school turns the traditional photography paradigm on its head. Those whose normal role is limited to their function as objects of photography receive training to document their own lives. The movement originated in American efforts two decades ago to aid rural Chinese women, who had never used a camera, but now encompasses all efforts to take charge of one's own narrative using photography.&lt;ref name=Brochure /&gt;  Milestones include the NYC exhibit Unbroken by [[Photovoice|PhotoVoice]], a group dedicated to this school of photography.&lt;ref name=Brochure /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salamon"/&gt; George Carrano served as the show’s curator.&lt;ref name="Kodak Blog" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Team /&gt;

== The Program ==

Developing Lives includes weekly sessions in which instructors present a new [[Photography|photography technique]] (light, shadow, camera language, etc.) and introduce a well-known photographer whose work exemplifies that technical style. The program distributes single-use Kodak cameras at the start of every class which are returned the following week. The [[film]] is then processed and photographs reviewed and returned. Participants are asked to bear in mind the new photography technique when documenting their lives throughout the week.&lt;ref name=Class&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing Lives Class Information|url=http://studionycha.org/developinglives/developing-lives-class-information/|publisher=Studio NYCHA|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to teaching technical skills, Developing Lives also helps participants become [[Documentary film|documentary]] photographers. The classes discuss the art of [[storytelling]] through a photograph. All photographs are paired with handwritten captions from the photographer.&lt;ref name=Class /&gt;

The Developing Lives photographs were combined with a narrative explaining the challenges faced by residents, and published as [[Project Lives]] in April 2015.

[[File:Shrivatsa.JPG|thumb|More decorative]]
[[File:Endless knot Red lacquerware dish Ming Dynasty.jpg|thumb|More complex form seen on ca. 400-year-old Chinese lacquerware dish.]]

The '''endless knot''' or '''eternal knot''' ({{lang-sa|[[śrīvatsa]]}}; [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] དཔལ་བེའུ། ''dpal be'u''; [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] ''Ulzii'') is a symbolic [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] and one of the [[Ashtamangala|Eight Auspicious Symbols]]. It is an important cultural marker in places significantly influenced by [[Tibetan Buddhism]] such as [[Tibet]], [[Mongolia]], [[Tuva]], [[Kalmykia]], and [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryatia]]. It is also sometimes found in [[Chinese art]] and used in [[Chinese knotting|Chinese knots]].

== History ==
The endless knot symbol appears on clay tablets from the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (2500 BC),&lt;ref&gt;Robert Beer (2003),The Handbook of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols, Serindia Publications, {{ISBN|1-59030-100-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the same symbol also appears on an historic era inscription.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Danino (2010), Lost River: On The Trail of the Sarasvati,Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0143068644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations ==
The endless knot has been described as "an ancient symbol representing the interweaving of the [[spirtuality|Spiritual]] path, the flowing of [[Time]] and Movement within That Which is [[Eternity|Eternal]]. All existence, it says, is bound by time and [[Impermanence|change]], yet ultimately rests serenely within the [[Divinity|Divine]] and the Eternal."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Anna |first=Christina |title=Ancient Symbols |url=http://www.pinterest.com/explore/ancient-symbols/?p=1 |publisher=pinterest.com |year=2012 |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various interpretations of the symbol are:

* The eternal continuum of mind.
* The endless knot iconography symbolised [[Samsara]] ''i.e.'', the endless cycle of suffering or birth, death and rebirth within Tibetan Buddhism.
* The inter-twining of [[Wisdom in Buddhism|wisdom]] and [[metta|compassion]].
* Interplay and interaction of the opposing forces in the [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] world of manifestation, leading to their union, and ultimately to harmony in the universe.
* The [[mutual dependence]] of [[religious doctrine]] and [[secular]] affairs.
* The union of [[Wisdom in Buddhism|wisdom]] and [[Upasana|method]].
* The inseparability of [[emptiness]] ([[shunyata]]) and [[dependent origination]], the underlying [[reality]] of [[existence]].
* Symbolic of knot symbolism in linking [[ancestor]]s and [[omnipresence]] (refer etymology of [[Tantra]], [[Yoga]] and [[religion]]) (see [[Namkha]].)
* Since the knot has no beginning or end it also symbolizes the [[wisdom]] of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1961">'''Fondazione Roberto Longhi''' is an institute established by [[Italy|Italian]] scholar Roberto Longhi, located on Via Benedetto Fortini in [[Florence]], [[Tuscany]], Italy.

==History==
In [[Roberto Longhi]] 1971 left his [[library]], photograph collection, and [[art collection]] "for the benefit of future generations". 

The headquarters is the villa "Il Tasso" which Longhi acquired in 1939. This villa was the residence of Longhi and his wife Lucia Lopresti (the writer [[Anna Banti]]). The Foundation's preferred sphere of interest is [[art history|art historical]] research. It also focuses on artists and specific artistic themes, including [[contemporary art]] and artists. The [[museum]] (''pinacoteca'') of the Foundation is open only to scholars and by appointment.

==Activities==
The Foundation's activities include [[Art exhibition|art exhibit]]s, [[publication]]s, [[lesson]]s, [[:wikt:conference|conferences]], [[seminar]]s, and scholarly meetings. These meetings are organized on a periodic basis and are generally of an international and [[interdisciplinary]] nature.

Each year the Foundation grants a series of [[scholarship|fellowship]]s to young Italian and foreign scholars selected on the basis of a competition.   Since 1971, 300 young scholars have been granted a fellowship by the Longhi Foundation. Many of them now work in renowned [[museum]]s or are professors in important Italian and foreign [[university|universities]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8679">The '''Future Library project''' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''Framtidsbiblioteket'') is a public artwork that aims to collect an original work by a popular writer every year from 2014 to 2114 and to share them with the world only then. One thousand trees were specially planted for the project in the [[Nordmarka]] forest at its inception&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/10/future-library_n_7532012.html|title='Future Library' Reminds Us How Connected Books And The Environment Really Are|website=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the 100 books will be printed in limited-edition anthologies using paper made from the trees. ''[[The Guardian]]'' has referred to it as "the world's most secretive library".&lt;ref name="kang"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/31/han-kang-bury-book-100-years-norwegian-forest-future-library|title=Han Kang to bury next book for almost 100 years in Norwegian forest|first=Alison|last=Flood|publisher=The Guardian|date=2018-08-31|accessdate=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The project was conceived by [[Katie Paterson]] during the summer of 2014. It is managed by the Future Library Trust and supported by the [[Oslo|City of Oslo]], [[Norway]]. It was produced for the Slow Space public art program and commissioned by [[Bjørvika]], Oslo's former container port, and its development corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.futurelibrary.no/|title=Future Library – Framtidsbiblioteket - Katie Paterson|page=About|accessdate=2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscripts will be held in a specially designed room at the new [[Oslo Public Library|Deichman Library]] (Oslo Public Library) currently under construction in Bjørvika, Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Reader offer: buy a Katie Paterson Future Library limited-edition print|url = https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/nov/23/reader-offer-katie-paterson-print-future-library|newspaper = the Guardian|date=November 23, 2014 |first = Vanessa|last = Thorpe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = In English|url = http://blogg.deichman.no/nyedeichman/in-english/|accessdate = 2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Katie Paterson has been working with the architectural team to design this part of the new public library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nothingintherulebook.com/2018/05/23/creatives-in-profile-interview-with-katie-paterson/|title=Creatives in profile – interview with Katie Paterson|date=2018-05-23|work=nothingintherulebook|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collected works will be on display but the manuscripts will not be available for reading.

The Future Library Trust's committee of trustees will make a new selection annually based on the criteria "outstanding contributions to literature or poetry, and for their work's ability to capture the imagination of this and future generations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A library that won't be read for 100 years|url = http://www.mprnews.org/story/2015/05/29/books-thread-future-library|website = www.mprnews.org|accessdate = 2015-08-09|first = Tracy|last = Mumford}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Umberto Eco]] and [[Tomas Tranströmer]], both deceased as of 2016, were previously considered as potential contributors. All other authors approached by Paterson have accepted the invitation.&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/the-future-library-why-you-face-a-big-wait-to-read-any-of-the-books-20170113-gtqw6i.html|title=The Future Library: Why you face a big wait to read any of the books|first=Gaby|last=Wood|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=2017-01-13|accessdate=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One thousand certificates entitling the holder to the full anthology in 2114 are being sold by the artist's galleries:  Ingleby Gallery (Edinburgh), James Cohan Gallery (New York) and Parafin (London).

==Criticism==
The Future Library project has attracted criticism for its emphasis on preventing readership between 2014 and 2114.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maggietiede.com/2018/09/05/margaret-atwood-han-kang-and-more-will-bury-their-new-novels-for-100-years-what-do-you-think-about-the-future-library-project/|first=Maggie|last=Tiede|title=Margaret Atwood, Han Kang, and more will bury their new novels for 100 years.

[[File:Merry brothers 1887.jpg|thumb|right|350px|[[Uroš Predić]], ''Happy Brothers'', 1887, oil on canvas, {{convert|82|by|122|cm}}, [[National Museum of Serbia]]|alt=Four men walking through a village in an intoxicated state]]
'''''Happy Brothers, Their Poor Mother!'''''{{efn|{{lang-sr-Latn|Vesela braća, žalosna im majka!}} {{lang-sr-Cyrl|Весела браћа, жалосна им мајка!}}}} (often referred to simply as '''''Happy Brothers'''''){{efn|{{lang-sr-Latn|Vesela braća}}, {{lang-sr-Cyrl|Весела браћа}}}} is an 1887 [[oil painting]] by the Serbian artist [[Uroš Predić]]. It shows four intoxicated youths walking through their village whilst the mother of one shouts her disapproval from the distance. The painting is said to have been inspired by a frequent sight in Predić's home village of [[Orlovat]]—that of drunken youths returning from the pub at dawn. Predić painted the composition hoping it would persuade the villagers to change their ways. He was disappointed that it not only failed to decrease the incidence of drunkenness in Orlovat, but was well received by the villagers themselves, who were happy merely to have been depicted.

One [[art history|art historian]] suggests the painting was influenced by the works of [[Rosa Bonheur]] and [[Gustave Courbet]], while another believes it was informed by those of the satirists [[William Hogarth]] and [[Honoré Daumier]]. The painting's humorous content contributed to its popularity among critics, collectors and the public at large, which led to Predić painting two replicas in 1918 and 1922. By 1890, the original was owned by the [[National Museum of Serbia]], in whose possession it remains.

==Background==
[[Uroš Predić]] (1857–1953) was one of the most successful 19th- and 20th-century Serbian [[Realism (arts)|realists]].{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=31}} A native of [[Orlovat]], a village in the [[Banat]] region of [[Austria-Hungary]], Predić drew scenes of life in the village throughout his career.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=35}} One of the more frequent sights during his stays there was of intoxicated young men returning from the pub at dawn and waking up the whole village.&lt;ref name="Pivnica"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Pivnica.net|title=Vesela braća, žalosna im majka|trans-title=Happy Brothers, Their Poor Mother!|language=Croatian|url=http://www.pivnica.net/vesela-braca-zalosna-im-majka/2126/|date=17 July 2012|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In painting the composition, Predić was not only attempting to realistically depict contemporary village life but also to convey a message. "I observed this every day", he explained. "I said to myself there must be some way of telling these people to what an unhappy level they have descended and have a moral impact on them, capturing all the bad habits of my compatriots."{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=35}} Predić had expressed disapproval of the villagers' behavior in an earlier work, ''Clients in Front of a Lawyer's Door'' (1886).{{sfn|Jovanović|2009|p=89}}

==Painting==
===Description===
''Happy Brothers, Their Poor Mother!'', often referred to simply as ''Happy Brothers'', is an [[oil painting]] that measures {{convert|82|by|122|cm}}.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=36}} "It is a glimpse into village life in early fall", Predić explained. "The harvest has been gathered and the pigs slaughtered. The fires have been lit, the spits turned, the drinks dispensed and the celebrations fully under way. The air is filled with the aroma of&amp;nbsp;... cooking meat&amp;nbsp;... and the sounds of music and drunken song that disturb the village's peace."{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=35}}

[[File:Uroš Predić 1982 Yugoslavia stamp.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Predić's self-portrait on a 1982 Yugoslav postage stamp]]

According to Predić, the painting shows four intoxicated youths who have been drinking all night walking rowdily through their village around dawn and waking all their neighbours. They trudge down the middle of the [[dirt road]], keeping their distance from the surrounding houses so as to avoid crashing against a wall and hurting themselves. The ''[[gaida|gajda]]'' (bagpipe) player, the most sober of the four, walks slightly ahead of his friends. The one to the left, the youngest of the group, walks barefoot through the mud and props one of his friends up against his shoulder. The man he is propping up, who is the most intoxicated, paid for the previous night's drinks and bounces between shoulders for support. The man to his right has just realized that he is walking by his own dilapidated home. His mother, alerted by the young men's laughter and song, emerges from the house and recognizes her son.{{efn|Filipovitch-Robinson writes that the woman is the mother of all four.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2007|pp=131–132}}}} She begins to shout at him and threatens to spank him once he returns, but the young man simply laughs and sends her an acknowledging wave with his hat. A young girl peaks out the bottom pane of the left window of the house to the far right, wondering if her boyfriend is part of the group. A sign above her reads ''Szeszfőzde'' ("distillery" in Hungarian). Predić's initials in [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], ''У.П.'', can be found in the bottom-right corner.&lt;ref name="Vienac"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Klaić|first1=Vjekoslav|authorlink1=Vjekoslav Klaić|last2=Maravić|first2=M.|title=K slikam|trans-title=On art|language=Croatian|volume=20|number=43|publisher=Vienac|location=Zagreb|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ENwxAQAAIAAJ|p=687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his notes, Predić identified the individuals depicted in the painting as "Maks" (the ''gajda'' player), Nikola Bojić (the man waving his hat) and Nikola Madžarov (the man bobbing between friends). Predić described the person to Madžarov's right as simply "a young man from Orlovat".{{sfn|Vukmanović|Živanović|2005|pp=105–106}}

===Analysis===
The [[art history|art historian]] Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson posits that the painting is informed by the progressive style of French realists such as [[Rosa Bonheur]] and [[Gustave Courbet]]. She concedes that there is no documentary evidence to suggest Predić was influenced by Courbet's depictions of peasant life, but notes that the latter's work was in the public domain at the time ''Happy Brothers'' was created and was quite popular throughout Europe. Filipovitch-Robinson believes that Predić rejected the precision and [[Perspective (graphical)|linearism]] of both [[Academic art|Academic]] and [[Biedermeier]] art, and, as Courbet would have done, used heavily textured brushstrokes to define the roughness of the muddy road. She also draws parallels between the painting and Courbet's ''[[Peasants of Flagey]]'', which was shown at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1850–51 alongside ''[[The Stone Breakers]]'' and ''[[A Burial At Ornans]]''.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=35}}

The art historian [[Dejan Medaković]] once suggested that Predić was imitating the style of satirists [[William Hogarth]] and [[Honoré Daumier]]. Filipovitch-Robinson writes that if this were so, Predić's attempt at emulation was almost certainly unsuccessful. "Perhaps this was due to the inherent limitations of his subject", she writes, "the fact that the figures are not caricatured and that the painting is devoid of biting or mocking humor".{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2007|pp=131–132}} According to Filipovitch-Robinson, Predić's treatment of Balkan rural life differs in a number of ways from that of his contemporary [[Paja Jovanović]], who was known for painting similar subjects. Jovanović's paintings were based on careful ethnographic studies of rural costumes and everyday objects, whereas Predić's works lack Jovanović's precision, owing to the artist's tendency not to produce detailed studies of his subjects beforehand. "The images", Filipovitch-Robinson writes, "are more gestural because of the combination of generous brush strokes and minimal linear definition. This painting also brings Predić much closer to the more daring experimentations of the [[Munich School]] not only because of the textural play of the mud-laden soil against rough peasant garb but in his convincing presentation of the atmosphere of the quiet predawn hours."{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2007|pp=131–132}}

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:Milan Rešetar 1904 Mayerhofer.png|thumb|right|220px|Critic [[Milan Rešetar]] considered the painting one of Predić's best works]]
Upon seeing reproductions of the painting, the villagers did not interpret it as a call to change their ways. Instead, they were flattered by Predić's decision to depict them.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=35}} "To local audiences in particular", Filipovitch-Robinson writes, "such lighthearted didacticism entwined with a familiar and beloved world was immensely satisfying".{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2002|p=366}} It is said that on one of his visits home, Predić went to the local pub and encountered the patrons examining a calendar with a reproduction of his painting inside it. A number of patrons—some of whom were included in the composition—tapped him on the shoulder in drunken stupor and commended him on how accurately he had captured them.&lt;ref name="Pivnica"/&gt; What Filipovitch-Robinson calls Predić's "well-meaning and subtle moralizing" had thus been rendered ineffectual.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=35}}

Writing for the [[Novi Sad]]-based publication ''Javor'' in 1890, the critic [[Milan Rešetar]] ranked the painting among Predić's finest works up to that point.&lt;ref name="Javor"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Rešetar|first=Milan|authorlink=Milan Rešetar|date=16 September 1890|title=Уметност|trans-title=Art|language=Serbian|volume=17|number=37|publisher=Javor|location=Novi Sad|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ftYDAAAAYAAJ|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Croatian magazine ''Vienac'' offered a positive review of the work, saying it offered a sad look at conditions in the Banat. The magazine praised Predić as "a true artist&amp;nbsp;... one who isn't afraid to use his talent to educate people and nurture the nobler aspects of human nature".&lt;ref name="Vienac"/&gt; Critics were satisfied with ''Happy Brothers'' because it not only offered an instructive narrative but also demonstrated the artist's technical abilities.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2002|p=366}} Such vignettes of village life contributed greatly to Predić's popularity among collectors from the emerging Serbian [[middle class]]. Reproductions of the painting met with commercial success, further contributing to its popularity. This led Predić to paint two replicas, one in 1918 and the other in 1922.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=35}} By 1890, the original was owned by the [[National Museum of Serbia]],&lt;ref name="Javor"/&gt; in whose possession it remains.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=319}}

[[File:Harvard Classics.jpg|thumb|320px|right|The first 10 volumes of ''The Harvard Classics''.]]

[[Image:Charles William Eliot.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Charles William Eliot, compiler and editor of ''The Harvard Classics'' anthology.]]

The '''''Harvard Universal Classics,''''' originally known as '''Dr. Eliot's Five Foot Shelf,''' is a 51-volume [[anthology]] of classic works from world literature, compiled and edited by [[Harvard University]] president [[Charles W. Eliot]] and first published in 1909.&lt;ref name=kirsch&gt;Adam Kirsch, [http://harvardmagazine.com/2001/11/the-five-foot-shelf-reco.html The "Five-foot Shelf" Reconsidered], ''Harvard Magazine'', Volume 103, Number 2. November–December 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliot had stated in speeches that the elements of a [[liberal education]] could be obtained by spending 15 minutes a day reading from a collection of books that could fit on a five-foot shelf. (Originally he had said a three-foot shelf.)  The publisher [[Peter Fenelon Collier|P. F. Collier and Son]] saw an opportunity and challenged Eliot to make good on this statement by selecting an appropriate collection of works, and the ''Harvard Classics'' was the result.

Eliot worked for one year with [[William Allen Neilson|William A. Neilson]], a professor of English; Eliot determined the works to be included and Neilson selected the specific editions and wrote introductory notes.&lt;ref name=kirsch/&gt; Each volume had 400–450 pages, and the included texts are "so far as possible, entire works or complete segments of the world's written legacies."&lt;ref name="findarticles"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3708/is_200604/ai_n17178495 Dr. Eliot's Five-Foot Shelf of Books: Toward a Centennial of The Harvard Classics, ''Papers on Language and Literature'' - Find Articles]&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection was widely advertised by Collier and Son, in ''[[Collier's Magazine|Collier's]]'' and elsewhere, with great success.

==Enduring success==
As [[Adam Kirsch]], writing for [[Harvard Magazine|''Harvard'' magazine]] in 2001, notes, "It is surprisingly easy, even today, to find a complete set of the Harvard Classics in good condition. At least one is usually for sale on eBay, the Internet auction site, for $300 or so, a bargain at $6 a book. The supply, from attics or private libraries around the country, seems endless &amp;mdash; a tribute to the success of the publisher, P.F.

'''''Hölderlin's Hymn "The Ister"''''' ({{lang-de|Hölderlins Hymne »Der Ister«}}) is the title given to a lecture course delivered by German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] at the [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg|University of Freiburg]] in 1942. It was first published in 1984 as volume 53 of Heidegger's [[Gesamtausgabe (Heidegger)|''Gesamtausgabe'']]. The translation by [[William McNeill (philosopher)|William McNeill]] and Julia Davis was published in 1996 by [[Indiana University Press]]. ''[[Der Ister (poem)|Der Ister]]'' is a poem by [[Friedrich Hölderlin]], the title of which refers to an ancient name for a part of the [[Danube River]].

==Overview==
In 1942, in the darkest depths of [[World War II]] and the [[National Socialism|National Socialist]] period, Heidegger chose to deliver a lecture course on a single poem by Friedrich Hölderlin: "''Der Ister''," about the river Danube. The course explored the meaning of poetry, the nature of technology, the relationship between [[ancient Greece]] and modern Germany, the essence of politics, and human dwelling. The central third of the lecture course is a reading of [[Sophocles|Sophocles']] [[Antigone (Sophocles)|''Antigone'']]. Heidegger undertakes this reading of ''Antigone'' ostensibly because of the importance of this text for grasping the meaning of Hölderlin's poetry, but in doing so he repeats and extends a reading he had conducted in a different context in 1935. In terms of Heidegger's ''oeuvre'', the 1942 lecture course is significant in that it is Heidegger's most sustained discussion of the essence of politics. Heidegger was only able to deliver two-thirds of the written text of the lecture course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theister.com/keyfigures.html ''The Ister'': A film by David Barison and Daniel Ross] and [[Gesamtausgabe (Heidegger)|Gesamtausgabe]] 53, editor's epilogue.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lecture course is divided into three parts.

*'''Part one''' introduces the way in which Heidegger believes it is necessary to approach [[Friedrich Hölderlin|Hölderlin's]] poetry, arguing against the "metaphysical interpretation of art." He further argues that Hölderlin's poetry must be understood in terms of its essential kinship with the work of Sophocles.
*'''Part two''' retraces the interpretation of Sophocles' ''Antigone'' which Heidegger conducted in the 1935 lecture course, ''An Introduction to Metaphysics''. He extends this reading, modifying it in subtle ways.
*'''Part three''', which was in fact never delivered, returns to Hölderlin's poetry, arguing that the figure of the river in the poem is in fact the poet, and vice versa.

== Part one: Poetising the essence of the rivers ==

===The Ister hymn===
The lecture course opens with a reflection on the Greek origin of the word "[[hymn]]," meaning song of praise, specifically in praise of the gods, the heroes, or contest victors, in preparation of the festival. Heidegger cites a line from Sophocles' ''Antigone'' connecting the noun and verb forms of the word, and then indicates that the sense in which Hölderlin's works are hymns must initially remain an open question.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger turns his attention to the first line of "''Der Ister''"—"Now come, fire!" What could this mean, if "fire" here indicates the sun or the dawn? What could it mean to call, or to have the vocation for such a calling, given that the dawn will come whether it is called or not? And what is meant by "Now," by naming the time of such a calling? From these questions Heidegger is drawn to ask what it means to "poetise," answering that poetising is always inaugurating something, that genuine poetising is always poetising "anew." Thus the "Now" of the first line speaks not only of the present, but toward the future.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 6–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger next focuses on the fact that it is clear that "the rivers come to language" in Hölderlin's poetry. On the one hand, the rivers are detached from human being, having their own "spirit"; on the other hand, the rivers are a locale at which human beings find their dwelling place. The question is thus that of the poetic essence of the river.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The metaphysical interpretation of art===
Rather than delving immediately into this question, Heidegger makes a detour, elaborating the "metaphysical interpretation of art." He argues that metaphysical interpretations are incapable of comprehending Hölderlin's poetry.

According to the metaphysical interpretation, art presents objects in nature such as rivers, but this presentation is at the service of something else, of their "meaning" in the artwork. Heidegger speaks in this regard of the etymology of the words "[[allegory]]" and "[[metaphor]]." The metaphysical interpretation of art relies on the distinction between the sensuous and the non-sensuous, the aesthetic and the noetic, the sensible and the intelligible. And according to this interpretation the artwork exists not for itself, not ''as'' a sensuous object, but ''for'' the nonsensuous and suprasensuous, which is also named "spirit." In this way the superior and the true come to be identified with the spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 16–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Against the metaphysical interpretation of art, Heidegger asserts that the rivers in Hölderlin's poetry are in no way symbolic images of a higher or deeper content. He draws attention to the final lines of the poem—"Yet what that one does, that river, / No one knows"—in order to indicate that, whatever the rivers are, or whatever the river does, remains an enigma. Even the poet knows only that the river flows, but not what is ''decided'' in that flowing.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Locality and journeying===
Heidegger then turns to a consideration of the river as the dwelling place of human beings. As such, the river is what brings human beings into their own and maintains them there. Yet what is their own often remains foreign to human beings for a long time, and can be abandoned by them because it threatens to overwhelm them. It is not something that produces itself, but must come to be appropriate, and needs to be appropriated. The river is of assistance in the becoming-homely of human beings, but this "assistance" is not an occasional support but a steadfast standing by.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand what this means, Heidegger considers some lines from another Hölderlin poem, "Voice of the People," in which the rivers are referred to as "vanishing" and as "full of intimation." That the rivers are vanishing means that they abandon the human landscape, without thereby being unfaithful toward that landscape. Yet as full of intimation, the rivers proceed into what is coming. Thus Heidegger sees Hölderlin as concerned with the temporality of the river in relation to the human, yet also with its spatiality—thus "the river is the journeying." The river is, he says, the journeying of becoming homely or, rather, the very locality attained in and through the journeying.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 27–31.&lt;/ref&gt; His claim is that the river is the locality of the dwelling of human beings as historical upon the earth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Rätsel''===
The river is an enigma (''[[:de:Rätsel|Rätsel]]''). But Heidegger relates this to ''Raten'', giving counsel, and to ''Rat'', counsel, but also "care." To give counsel means to take into care. That the river is an enigma does not mean it is a puzzle we should wish to "solve." Rather, it means it is something we should bring closer to us ''as'' an enigma.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; We must understand this poetry, therefore, in something other than a calculative, technical way.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space and time===
Locality and journeying: this sounds like "space and time." Succession takes its course in time, as a sequence of moments, as a "flowing." But this is in fact only an understanding of space and time as an ordered, calculable, relationality. Whatever is subject to order must be posited in advance in such a way that it becomes accessible for order and control. Hence, for example, the reduction to co-ordinates. Yet for calculative observation, something is what it is only through what it performs. All modern thinking thinks in terms of order and performance. Human activity is thought as labour, equated with mechanical energy, and assessed according to the performative principle. Through such thinking space and time come to be considered so obvious as not to require any further thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 40–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern technology===
Such modern thinking about space and time is essentially technological. Modern technology is different from every tool. Whereas the tool is a means, what is distinctive about modern technology is that this is no longer the case, and that it is instead unfolding a domination of its own. It demands its own kind of discipline and conquest. Thus, for example, the staged accomplishment of factories built for the purpose of fabricating machine tools for other factories. Modern machine technology is a specific kind of "truth." We may believe that technology, as the control of space and time, is never undertaken without purpose, and is therefore no end in itself. This, however, is a misunderstanding grounded in a failure to grasp the essence of modern technology. And this results from failing to question that which underpins it—the order and unity of "space and time."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger then deconstructs the concepts of space and time, arguing firstly that these cannot be merely "objects," as though they were some gigantic containers in which everything is accommodated. Yet neither can we conclude that they are merely subjective. Is space, over which wars erupt, merely imaginary? And is time, which tears us along and tears us away, merely subjective? Such metaphysical interpretations of space and time will be of no help in understanding the locality and journeying at the heart of Hölderlin's non-metaphysical poetising. Space and time comprise the framework for our calculative domination and ordering of the "world" through technology. But it remains undecided whether this process is turning human beings into mere planetary adventurers, or whether it is the beginning of another tendency, toward new forms of settlement and resettlement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 45–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialogue===
According to Heidegger, that poetry of Hölderlin's taking the form of the "hymn" has taken into its care this becoming homely in one's own. He asserts that "one's own" is in this case the German fatherland, but immediately adds that "coming to be at home is thus a passage through the foreign." This is why this poetry necessarily takes the form of a dialogue with foreign poets, specifically, [[Pindar]] and Sophocles. What must be carefully listened to in the hymnal poetry of Hölderlin is this "resonance" of Greek poetry, on which basis Heidegger turns to the interpretation of ''Antigone''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 48–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Part two: The Greek interpretation of human beings in Sophocles' ''Antigone'' ==

===The choral ode===
The choral ode from the ''Antigone'' of Sophocles is according to Heidegger the singular work radiating throughout the poetry of Hölderlin.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger had previously interpreted this ode in his 1935 lecture course, ''An Introduction to Metaphysics'', and in 1942 he both recapitulates and extends this interpretation.

Like "''Der Ister''," the ode begins with a call to the dawning sun, yet it is clear the ode is equally concerned with darkness. Although the ode is concerned with the light and darkness of human being, this should not be interpreted to mean that the two main figures, Creon and Antigone, form an opposition. Each of these figures proceed from out of the unity of essence and nonessence, but differently in each case.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Deinon''===
The decisive word, according to Heidegger, occurs at the beginning of the ode: ''deinon''. Heidegger translates this as ''das Unheimliche'', the uncanny. Heidegger emphasises what he calls the "counterturning" character of the term. ''Deinon'', he says, means the fearful, the powerful, and the inhabitual. But none of these definitional elements is one-dimensional. As the fearful, the ''deinon'' is also that which, as worthy of honour, can awaken awe. As the powerful, it may be that which looms over us, or that which is merely violent. As the inhabitual, the extraordinary, the extraordinariness of skill, it exceeds the ordinary, but it can do so as that which governs the ordinary and the habitual. As ''das Unheimliche'', ''deinon'' names the unity of all these meanings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 61–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ode names the human being as ''deinon'' in manifold ways, indeed as the ''most'' uncanny being, ''das Unheimlichste''. Heidegger ties this to his prior argument that human beings as poetised by Hölderlin are "unhomely" ("''unheimisch''"), that is, on the way toward becoming homely. The extraordinariness of human being is this being un-homely that is also a becoming homely. Heidegger makes clear that this being unhomely does not mean simply homelessness, wandering around, adventurousness, or lack of rootedness. Rather, it means that the sea and the land are those realms that human beings transform through skillfulness and use. The homely is that which is striven for in the violent activity of passing through the inhabitual. Yet even so, the homely is not attained in this activity: as the ode says, man "comes to nothing."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 68–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Poros''===
Human being is thus the being which finds passage through everything, yet always comes up short, expressed in the couple ''pantoporos aporos'', where ''poros'' means that irruption of power that finds its way through. Infinitely skillful and artful, human beings nevertheless can never circumvent death. This is something known by human beings, but mostly in the form of evading this knowledge. Human beings are in fact those beings which comport themselves to beings as such, and because they understand being, human beings alone can also forget being. The uncanniness of human beings is that they alone are capable of "catastrophe," in the sense of a reversal turning them away from their own essence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 74–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Polis''===
Heidegger next turns to the couple ''hypsipolis apolis'', "towering high above the site," and "forfeiting the site." This couple is based in the word ''[[polis]]'', and Heidegger notes that, if this is the ''origin'' of the word "political," then it is a mistake to understand the former on the basis of the latter—the ''polis'' is precisely not a political concept. The "political" is conventionally understood in terms of consciousness, in a "technical" manner, as the way in which history is accomplished. It is thus marked by a failure to question itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 79–80, 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger asks whether the ''polis'' might not be the name of that realm which constantly becomes questionable anew and remains worthy of question. Perhaps the ''polis'' is that around which everything question-worthy and uncanny turns in an exceptional way. Heidegger uses the word ''Wirbel'', swirl, in this context, and speaks of the ''polis'' as essentially "polar." The pre-political essence of the ''polis'', that which makes possible everything which we call political, is the open site from out of which all human relations toward beings are determined.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 80–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human being===
It is thus the essence of human being to both ascend within their site and to be without site. Human being bears within it this potential for reversal, a potential essentially grounded in the possibility of being mistaken, of taking nonbeings for beings and beings for nonbeings. Thus human beings are creatures of risk. They seek to become homely within a site, place everything at stake in this, and encounter the fact that the homely refuses itself to them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 87–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the uncanniness of human being, and this is why ''deinon'' does not mean simply power and violence. Human beings do not themselves make themselves the most uncanny thing; it is not a matter of self-consciousness here. Only because human beings can say "it is," Heidegger says, can they say "I am." And only because they have a relation to being can they "say" at all, that is, can they be [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] ''zoon logon echon''. It is the distinction of human beings, in other words, to "see" the open.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antigone===
The closing words of the ode speak of the expulsion of the most uncanny from the hearth. If we were to interpret this as a rejection of Creon, according to Heidegger, then the choral ode would not be a "high song of culture" so much as a song in praise of mediocrity, of hatred toward the exception. To interpret otherwise than this means asking where Antigone herself stands in relation to the ''deinon''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 92–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the introductory dialogue between Antigone and Ismene, Ismene tries to dissuade her sister from her resolution to bury their brother. Antigone's "pursuit" is, she says, concerned with that against which nothing can avail. Antigone, in other words, takes the impossible as her point of departure. She says herself that she wishes to suffer or bear the uncanny. In this she is removed from all human possibilities, and is the supreme uncanny.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 98–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The hearth===
What, then, of the hearth? The chorus speaks not only of expulsion, but of "not sharing their delusion with my knowing." All knowledge of the ''deinon'' is sustained and guided by that knowing which knows the hearth. The content of this knowing is not stated directly, but it is, however, referred to as a ''phronein'', a meditating from the heart. If this knowledge takes the form of intimation, it is not mere opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 105–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

If mythology is not simply an "immature" invention, then thinking stands in an essential relation to poetising. Thinking is not the sediment left after the demythologising of myth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 111–112.&lt;/ref&gt; Such reflections are intended by Heidegger to assist in the following gesture: the assertion that the hearth, named by the chorus, is being. "Being is the hearth."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; He then cites Plato on [[Hestia]], the goddess named for the hearth. The expulsion referred to in the closing words of the choral ode is not a rejection of the unhomely, as much as an impulsion to be attentive to the homely, to risk belonging to it. Being unhomely is a not yet awakened, not yet decided, potential for being homely. This is Antigone's supreme action.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 113–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The purest poem===
In Heidegger's translation, what determines this action is stated by Antigone as being beyond both the upper and lower gods, beyond [[Zeus]] and [[Dike (mythology)|Dike]], but neither can it be any human ordinance. Hence at stake in her action is the most uncanny risk. The closing words of the ode call in the direction of a knowledge of the proper essence of the unhomely one. In this most enigmatic part of his interpretation, Heidegger speaks of "the risk of distinguishing and deciding between that being unhomely proper to human beings and a being unhomely that is inappropriate." To be this risk is Antigone's essence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 116–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus Heidegger concludes that to understand the truth of ''Antigone'', it is necessary to think beyond the cult of the dead or the cult of blood-relatedness, which seem at first glance to be the motors of the tragedy. Antigone, he says, is herself the purest poem.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Poetising is neither finding nor inventing, but a telling finding of being, revealing that which is always already revealed, the nearest of all that is near. The human potential for being, and the unhomely being homely of human beings upon the earth, is poetic. What is spoken in the choral ode remains indeterminate, but neither vague nor arbitrary. The indeterminate is, on the contrary, that which is undecided yet first to be decided. If this is the case, then the tragedy poetises that which is in the highest sense worthy of poetising. And this may be why this ode came to speak ever anew to the poet Hölderlin.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 119–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Part three: Hölderlin's poetising of the essence of the poet as demigod==

===One's own and the foreign===
Sophocles' ode and Hölderlin's river hymns poetise the Same, yet they are not identical. To understand this, Heidegger turns to Hölderlin's famous letter to [[:de:Casimir Ulrich Boehlendorff|Casimir Boehlendorff]], which thematises the relations between Germany and Greece. According to Heidegger's reading, what for the Greeks is their own is what is foreign to the Germans, and what is foreign to the Germans is what is proper to the Greeks. Hölderlin is the first to experience poetically that becoming homely means being unhomely, thus to understand the need of being unhomely, which he does by venturing into an encounter with the (Greek) foreign.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 123–125.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spirit===
Heidegger then cites Hölderlin: "namely at home is spirit / not at the commencement, not at the source." He asks: who is "spirit"? Despite the influence of German metaphysics, Heidegger argues that Hölderlin's use of this word was singular, as that which is alongside itself in thinking itself, and always as "communal" spirit. What spirit thinks is that which is fittingly destined for human beings, yet this is always that which is futural, never something that has been decided; it is something "non-actual" that is already "acting." Poetising is the telling of the thoughts of spirit.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 125–128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spirit is never "at home" in the beginning. At the beginning of the history of a people, their destiny is assigned, but what has been assigned is in coming; it is still veiled and equivocal. In the beginning, the ability to fit oneself to one's destiny is as yet disordered, unpracticed. Thus in spirit there prevails the longing for its own essence. But "spirit loves colony," that is, in the foreign it wills the mother who is difficult to attain. And it loves "bold forgetting," where forgetting means the readiness to learn from the foreign for the sake of what is one's own, so as to defer what is one's own until it is time. It is in this way that the law of being unhomely is the law of becoming homely.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 129–133.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greeks and Germans===
The Greeks, too, had to pass through the foreign. What was proper to the Greeks was "the fire from the heavens"; what was foreign was the "clarity of presentation." Through what was foreign to them they were able to build at the essential ground of the ''polis''. For the Germans, on the other hand, the clarity of presentation is natural—the formation of projects, frameworks, etc. What is foreign is the fire from heaven, and thus they must learn to be struck by this fire, and thereby impelled to the correct appropriation of their gift for presentation. Otherwise they shall be exposed to the weakness of suppressing every fire, of pursuing [[delimitation]] and institution only for the sake of it. Hölderlin is the one who has been struck by this fire, yet why must this be said poetically?&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 135–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poem, river, demigod===
Heidegger cites Hölderlin in order to seek an answer to this question. "Full of merit, yet poetically / Humans dwell upon the earth." "Full of merit" refers, according to Heidegger, to all that humans achieve through the arts, through ''tekhne'', but all that is achieved this way amounts merely to culture. It can be achieved only on the basis of a "dwelling" which can be seized upon through making or achieving within the realm of the actual. Dwelling, the becoming homely of a being unhomely, is grounded in the poetic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt;

But what is poetry? There must be a poet who poetises in advance the essence of poetry. This will be the poet who ventures into the foreign, to let the fire come toward him. This is what occurs in Hölderlin's hymnal poetry. This river poetry never forgets the source, in its issuing and flowing from the source. What it says is the holy, which, ''beyond'' the gods, determines the gods. The poet stands between human beings and gods. The poet, and the river, are demigods.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 138–139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger speaks of the lines of the hymn concerning the invitation to [[Hercules]]. We can know nothing of the Ister or the hymn if we do not understand who this guest is. The appropriation of one's own ''is'' only as the encounter and guest-like dialogue with the foreign. The river must remain in the realm of its source in such a way that it flows toward it from out of the foreign, which is why it "appears, however, almost / To go backwards." Heidegger again uses the word ''Wirbeln'' to indicate this swirling near the source.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 140–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical, ahistorical, unhistorical===
This relation to the foreign is never an affirmation of the "natural" or the "organic." These are foreign to the law of history. This law places historical humankind on the difficult path toward its essence. If humankind abandons the law of history, it falls into the unhistorical. Nature is ahistorical, but being ''un''historical, as a ''rupture'' with the historical, is a particular kind of catastrophe. Heidegger's example of the unhistorical is [[Americanism (ideology)|Americanism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ister remains enigmatic but historical, in the strange way it flows but also remains close to the source. It is the river in which the foreign is already present as a guest at its source, the river in whose flowing there constantly speaks the dialogue between one's own and the foreign.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 144–146.&lt;/ref&gt; The rivers are the poets who found the poetic, upon whose ground human beings dwell. Thus the poetic spirit of the river makes arable the land—it prepares the ground for the hearth of the house of history, opening the time-space within which a belonging to the hearth is possible.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 146–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

===A sign is needed===
"A sign is needed": Hölderlin speaks of the sign as having a mind (''Gemüt''), where mind is the ground of all mindful courage (''Mut''). It is the poet who is named here as the sign. What is needed is the poet's word. Heidegger cites the poem "''Andenken''": "Yet what remains, the poets found." Heidegger relates the sign's showing to pain, to that knowing proper to being distinct.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 148–153.&lt;/ref&gt; The sign, the demigod, the river, the poet: all these name poetically the singular ground of the becoming homely of human beings as historical, and the founding of this ground by the poet. At stake is a "partaking in feeling" with the gods, bearing the sun and moon, sharing the holy. This is for the benefit not only of human beings, but of the gods themselves, who are otherwise without feeling, without unity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 154–156.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The stairs upon which the heavenly descend===
Through the sign, through the rivers, the heavenly find their unity with one another, a unity which does not diminish their singularity. The rivers are their "joy." Hölderlin speaks of staircases on which the heavenly can descend. Where there are staircases, a dwelling place is also opened up poetically for humans. Poetising founding builds the stairs for this descent of the heavenly. The rivers are the children of the heavens, signs that bear sun and moon in mind, but at the same time the sons of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 157–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hymn ends on an enigmatic note: "Yet what that one does, that river, / No one knows." What the vocation of the Ister is, it well knows, but the [[Rhine]], which does not linger at its source but departs sideways, is altogether concealed. Yet the Ister hymn too breaks off—it shows, it makes manifest, yet it also conceals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 163–165.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Is there a measure on earth?===
Heidegger appends a concluding remark to his reading of the poem. His remarks on the hymn were intended to make us attentive to the poetising of the rivers. But because this is the poetising of the essence of poetry, concealed relations prevail. Such poetry cannot at all be referred to the poet's ego, or to "subjectivity." The poet is the river, and vice versa. The unity of locality and journeying here cannot be conceived in terms of "space" and "time," for these are themselves the offspring of the realm that lets their openness spring forth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 165–166.&lt;/ref&gt;

This poetry demands a transformation in our ways of thinking and experiencing, and we must think beyond representations, symbols, and images. But if we must find a new measure, it must be asked whether we are capable of it. Hölderlin asks about this measure, and concludes there is no such measure on earth. This sounds like despair. Yet what Hölderlin means is that we must dwell poetically upon this earth, bearing and suffering it rather than forcing and seizing it. If we are strong enough to think, it may be sufficient for us to ponder from afar the truth of this poetry and what it poetises, so that we may suddenly be struck by it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidegger|Heidegger (1996)]], pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger ends with a quotation from yet another Hölderlin hymn, "The Journey":

{{cquote|A dream it becomes for him who would&lt;br /&gt;Approach it by stealth, and punishes him&lt;br /&gt;Who would equal it with force.&lt;br /&gt;Often it surprises one&lt;br /&gt;Who indeed has scarcely thought it.}}

'''''I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang!''''' is a book written by [[Robert Elliott Burns]] in 1932 and published by Grosset &amp; Dunlap. 

The book tells the story of Burns' imprisonment on a [[chain gang]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the 1920s, his subsequent escape, and the furor that developed. The story was first published in January 1932, serialized  in ''True Detective Mysteries'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-793 |title=New Georgia Encyclopedia: I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang! |publisher=The New Georgia Encyclopedia|accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Burns' story was made into the motion picture ''[[I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang]]'', starring [[Paul Muni]]. The book and movie were both credited with helping to reform deplorable conditions on Deep South chain gangs under Governor [[Ellis Arnall]] in 1943. 

A sequel, ''Out of These Chains'', was written by Burns' brother, [[Vincent Godfrey Burns]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian priest]], in 1942.

'''Isuma''' ([[Inuktitut syllabics]], '''ᐃᓱᒪ'''; [[Inuktituk]] for "to think") is [[Canada]]'s first [[Inuit]] (75%) [[production company]] co-founded by [[Zacharias Kunuk]], [[Paul Apak Angilirq]] and [[Norman Cohn (film producer)|Norman Cohn]] in [[Igloolik]], [[Nunavut]] in 1990. The company focuses on bringing people of multiple age ranges, cultural backgrounds, and belief systems together to support and promote [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Canada's indigenous community]] through television, the Internet and films. Isuma's mission is to produce independent community-based media aimed to preserve and enhance [[Inuit culture]] and language; to create jobs and economic development in Igloolik and Nunavut; and to tell authentic Inuit stories to Inuit and non-Inuit audiences worldwide. Isuma is related to [[Arnait Video Productions]].

In 2011, Isuma filed for [[receivership]], citing $750,000 in debts, including $500,000 to Atuqtuarvik Corp. of [[Rankin Inlet]]. A Montreal-based receiver, [[RSM Richter]], is putting company’s assets—most notably its film library—up for sale.&lt;ref name=Dixon&gt;{{cite news|last=Dixon|first=Guy|title=Out in the cold: the struggle of Inuit film|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/movies/out-in-the-cold-the-struggle-of-inuit-film/article2287215/|accessdate=2 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=year-end&gt;{{cite news|title=Nunavut: a timeline for the year that was|url=http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/stories/article/65674nunavut_a_timeline_for_the_year_that_was/|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=[[Nunatsiaq News]]|date=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1999, the company filmed and produced the supernatural historical thriller ''[[Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner]]'',.  It was a box office success around the world, and won the [[Caméra d'Or]] for Best First Feature Film at the 2001 [[Cannes Film Festival]], six [[Genie Award]]s (including Best Picture), and several other international film awards. The film had its Canadian premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in 2001.

The massive critical success of ''Atanarjuat'' led to funding from [[Telefilm Canada]], enabling Isuma to begin development on multiple scripts. One of these, ''[[The Journals of Knud Rasmussen]]'', about the switch from [[shamanism]] to [[Christianity]] in Igloolik in the early 1920s, received the offer to open the Toronto International Film Festival in 2006.

Since Isuma means "to have a thought", the collaborators of Igloolik Isuma Productions encourage alternative and multimedia processes designed to make the world at large think not only about the Inuit and their current plight, but about indigenous peoples in general, and the future of the role of community in society. Much of the [[New World]]’s wealth today was extracted from its Aboriginal citizens, who by every measure now are the most destitute populations in these countries. If the Inuit of ''Fast Runner'' ended up in 1922 in church, the Inuit of ''The Journals'' ended up in today’s newspapers stories, living in [[Third World]] ghettos scattered across the wealthiest [[First World]] nations.

Historically, how a country treats its indigenous people is an excellent gauge of its social and political views on humanism in general; what happens to the indigenous peoples of any given country is a sign of what will eventually happen to the dominant culture in time. Even today the law, education, religion and media continue to efface living memories of Aboriginal cultural history. As Norman Cohn says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Save the seals and Save the bears seems more attractive than Save the people, but unless the rights of humans to live in their habitat are more widely recognized and protected it's a little fatuous to even dream about saving birds and animals.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Isuma aims to increase awareness and focus about and for indigenous peoples of all cultures, not just [[Northern Canada]], through encouraging multimedia approaches. Their goal is to ensure that these rights are not compartmentalized, but rather include the awareness of [[human rights]] in a larger cultural and holistic context: through exploration of spirituality, globalization, environmentalism, cinema, world media, and Native awareness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5367">'''Józef Sandel''' (Yiddish: יוסף סאנדעל; German: Josef Sandel; 29 September 1894, Kolomyia &amp;ndash; 1 December 1962, Warsaw)&lt;ref name="Elis"&gt;Elis, Binyamin (1965). "Sandel, Yosef." ''Leksikon fun der nayer yiddisher literatur''. New York: Congress for Jewish Culture. vol. 6, columns 300-301.&lt;/ref&gt; was a Polish-Jewish art historian and critic, an art dealer and collector, and an advocate on behalf of Jewish artists in postwar [[Poland]].

==Biography==
Sandel was born in Kolomea ([[Kolomyia]], Ukraine), then in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. The son of a cap maker, he attended the [[Maurice de Hirsch|Baron Hirsch]] school and then [[Gymnasium (Germany)|gymnasium]].&lt;ref name="Elis"/&gt;

Around 1920, he moved to [[Dresden]], Germany, where, in 1925, he co-published a short-lived German-language literary and art magazine, ''Mob: Zeitschrift der Jungen'' (Mob: Journal of youths).&lt;ref name="Elis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dietzel, Thomas, and Hans-Otto Hügel (1988). "[https://books.google.com/books?id=3_-Qc8E4FysC&amp;pg=PA807 Mob]." ''Deutsche literarische Zeitschriften, 1880-1945: Ein Repertorium.'' Munich: Saur. vol. 3, p. 807.&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently lived in France, Switzerland, and Austria, before returning to Dresden.&lt;ref name="Elis"/&gt;

From 1929 to 1933, he operated an art gallery in [[Dresden]], called ''Galerie junge Kunst'' (Gallery of young art).&lt;ref name="Piatkowska78-79"&gt;Piątkowska, Renata (2008). "[https://books.google.com/books?id=M1TSi_QnJOIC&amp;pg=PA78 Jewish Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts / Di yidishe gezelshaft tsu farshpreytn kunst: An Attempt at the Continuation of Jewish Artistic Life in Postwar Poland, 1946-1949]." In: Elvira Grözinger and Magdalena Ruta (Eds.), ''Under the Red Banner: Yiddish Culture in the Communist Countries in the Postwar Era''. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag. p. 77-96; here p. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt; After the rise of the [[Nazism|National Socialist]] regime in Germany, he moved to [[Belgrade]] (then in [[Yugoslavia]]), where he opened another gallery and mounted exhibitions, in 1933-1934.&lt;ref name="Elis"/&gt;

In 1935, he moved to Poland; he spent time in [[Vilnius|Vilna]] (Vilnius) and Warsaw, and published articles on art in [[Yiddish | Yiddish-language]] periodicals, including ''Literarishe bleter''.&lt;ref name="Elis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piątkowska (2008), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; At the outbreak of the Second World War he fled to the Soviet Union, and survived the war in [[Kazakhstan]], where he taught German in a middle school.&lt;ref name="Elis"/&gt;

After the war, he returned to Poland and settled in [[Warsaw]], in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Piątkowska (2008), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; There he became the leader of the Jewish Society for the Promotion of Fine Arts (Polish: Żydowskie Towarzystwo Krzewienia Sztuk Pięknych; Yiddish: Yidishe gezelshaft tsu farshpreytn kunst), or ZTKSP, a revival of an organization that had been active in Poland before the war.&lt;ref&gt;Piątkowska (2008), p. 77-78.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society provided material assistance to Jewish artists, helped to promote their work, and fostered art education for Jewish youth.&lt;ref&gt;Piątkowska (2008), p. 79-83.&lt;/ref&gt; It mounted some 98 exhibitions in Warsaw, and four exhibitions that were presented throughout Poland&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; two devoted to the work of individual artists, [[Rafael Mandelzweig]], in 1946, and [[Lea Grundig]], in 1949; and two, in 1948, in honor of the fifth anniversary of the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], featuring works of Jewish artists who were killed in the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;Piątkowska (2008), p. 77, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the dissolution of the ZTKSP, in September 1949, the art works that Sandel and his colleagues had assembled were integrated into the collections of the [[Jewish Historical Institute]], Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;Piątkowska (2008), p. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1950 to 1953 the institute operated a Gallery of Jewish Art, with Sandel serving as director.&lt;ref&gt;Piątkowska (2008), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandel subsequently devoted himself to the writing of several art historical works concerning Jewish artists in Poland. Among his works, all written in Yiddish, is a two-volume biographical reference work on Jewish artists who perished in the Holocaust, ''Umgekumene yidishe kinstler in Poylen'' (Jewish artists in Poland who perished; Warsaw, 1957).&lt;ref name="Elis"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Sandel married Ernestyna Podhorizer (1903-1984), who was also originally from Galicia and worked for a time as the secretary of the ZTKSP. Sandel-Podhorizer was born in Dembits ([[Dębica]]), and before the war had been a biology teacher in Lemberg ([[Lviv]]); she was later a curator at the museum of the Jewish Historical Institute, and also worked at the Biology Institute in Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;Elis, Binyamin (1965).

The '''Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts''' ({{lang-pl|Towarzystwo Przyjaciół Sztuk Pięknych w Krakowie}}, TPSP), is a [[society|social group]] of artists, artisans and their supporters founded in [[Kraków]] in 1854, under the [[Austrian Partition]] of [[Partitions of Poland|Poland]]. Today, the Society operates from the [[Art Nouveau]] Palace of Art erected by its own members in 1901 at the Szczepański Square in [[Kraków Old Town]]. After major renovations of the Palace in 1996,&lt;ref name="art.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poland-art.com/index.php/wystawy/krakow/palac-sztuki-tpsp |title=Pałac Sztuki TPSP w Krakowie |publisher=Poland-art.com |work=Sztuka i kultura w Polsce. Wystawy i wernisaże |accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Society organizes local and international art exhibits and numerous other art initiatives.&lt;ref name="culture.pl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://culture.pl/pl/miejsce/palac-sztuki |title=Pałac Sztuki (The Palace of Art) |publisher=[[Instytut Adama Mickiewicza]] |work=Culture.pl |year=2014 |accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Palace of Art, 4,Szczepanski square,secession building, Krakow Old Town.jpg|thumb|left|Palace of Art, headquarters of the Society, view from pl. Szczepański Square, [[Krakow Old Town]] ]]

The nonprofit Society of Friends of Fine Arts was established in Kraków for the purpose of promoting [[Polish culture|Polish art and culture]],&lt;ref name="art.com"/&gt; against the foreign rulership of Austria-Hungary. The Society had a gallery at the Larisch'a Palace, and later in [[Sukiennice]], exhibiting [[Jan Matejko]] among others. Four decades after its original founding, using public donations and funds acquired from the sale of [[Artur Grottger]], on 26 June 1899 the Society began construction of its own Palace of Art along the popular [[Planty Park]], based on design by [[Franciszek Mączyński]].&lt;ref name="culture.pl"/&gt; 

After two years of meticulous construction, the gallery was ceremonially inaugurated on 11 May 1901 by the Mayor of Kraków, Count [[Edward Aleksander Raczyński]].&lt;ref name="art.com"/&gt; It was the first Art Nouveau building in the city, inspired by the [[Ancient Greek temple]]s, with [[Apollo]]'s sculpted head above its entrance, and [[Modernism|Modernist]] reliefs on outside walls designed by Professor [[Jacek Malczewski]] from the [[Academy of Fine Arts in Kraków]].&lt;ref name="krakow-info"&gt;Marek Strzala, [http://www.krakow-info.com/ArtPalac.htm  Kraków's Arts Palace] Kraków Info (homepage).&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Pałac Sztuki.JPG|thumb|120px|right|[[Apollo]]’s entrance]]

In early 20th century, the Palace run by the Society became one of the main exhibition venues of the [[Young Poland]] movement.&lt;ref name="art.com"/&gt; Today, the reborn Society composed of members of the [[Rotary International]] upholds its original mission of promoting contemporary art, both Polish and international. It organizes art auctions on site, sponsors its own Institute of Research and artwork Documentation (''Instytut Badań i Dokumentacji'') and publishes art catalogues about [[painting]], [[graphic arts]], [[drawing]] and [[sculpture]].&lt;ref name="culture.pl"/&gt;{{clear-left}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9722">The '''Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art''', operated by the Leslie-Lohman Gay Art Foundation, is a visual [[art museum]] in [[SoHo]], [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. It mainly collects, preserves and exhibits [[visual arts]] created by [[LGBTQ]] artists or art about LGBTQ themes, issues, and people.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, "Arts and Education," in ''The [[Harvey Milk Institute]] Guide to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Internet Research,'' 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum offers exhibitions year-round in numerous locations and owns more than 22,000 objects, including, paintings, drawings, photography, prints and sculpture. It has been recognized as one of the oldest arts groups engaged in the collection and preservation of gay art.&lt;ref&gt;Cotter, "Gay Pride (and Anguish) Around the Galleries," ''New York Times,'' June 24, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, the Foundation was awarded Museum status by the New York State Board of Regents.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/read/the-leslie-lohman-museum-of-gay-and-lesbian-art&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum is a member of the [[American Alliance of Museums]] and operates pursuant to their guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.leslielohman.org/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum maintains a Permanent Collection into which more than 1,300 objects have been accessioned.  The Permanent Collection contains works by a number of well-known gay artists such as [[Berenice Abbott]], [[David Hockney]], [[Ingo Swann]], [[Catherine Opie]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Tom of Finland]], [[Delmas Howe]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[David Wojnarowicz]], [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], [[George Platt Lynes]], [[Horst P. Horst|Horst]], [[Duncan Grant]], [[James Bidgood (filmmaker)|James Bidgood]], [[Duane Michals]], [[Charles Demuth]], [[Don Bachardy]], [[Attila Richard Lukacs]], [[Jim French (photographer)|Jim French]], [[Del LaGrace Volcano]], [[Paul Thek]], [[Peter Hujar]], [[Arthur Tress]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wmagazine.com/culture/not-a-fashion-photo/2014/08/gay-and-lesbian-art/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/arts/design/permanency-displays-gay-and-lesbian-art.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Genre"&gt;Sanchez, "Leslie-Lohman Gallery: The Ultimate Gay Portfolio," ''Genre Magazine,'' September 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
To exhibit and preserve art that speaks directly to the many aspects of the LGBTQ experience, and foster the artists who create it. We embrace the rich creative history of this community by educating, informing, inspiring, entertaining, and challenging all who enter our doors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.leslielohman.org/about.html|title= Leslie Lohman Missions Statement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Leslie-Lohman Gay Art Foundation was founded by J. Frederic "Fritz" Lohman and Charles W. Leslie.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;Robinson, "Future Events From Art to Zippers," ''The New York Times,'' April 25, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; The two men had been collecting art for several years, and mounted their first exhibition of gay art in their loft on Prince Street in New York City in 1969. They opened a commercial [[art museum|art gallery]] shortly thereafter, but this venue closed in the early 1980s at the advent of the [[AIDS]] [[pandemic]].&lt;ref name="Genre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeStefano"&gt;De Stefano, "Artistic Outlaws: Leslie and Lohman Have Fought to Preserve Gay Art for Three Decades," ''New York Blade,'' March 20, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the two men applied for nonprofit status as a precursor to establishing a foundation to preserve their collection of gay art and continue exhibition efforts. The [[Internal Revenue Service]] objected to the word "gay" in the title of the foundation and held up the nonprofit application for several years. The Foundation was granted nonprofit status in 1990.&lt;ref name="DeStefano" /&gt;

The Leslie-Lohman Gay Art Foundation's first location was in a basement at 127B Prince Street in New York City.&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeStefano" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, "The Week Ahead: Jan. 22 - Jan. 28," ''The New York Times,'' January 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Foundation moved into a ground floor gallery at 26 Wooster Street in historic SoHo; gallery space will be expanding in size in 2016-2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://artforum.com/news/id=54894&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
The Museum offers several principle programs, including the maintenance of its Permanent and Study Collections, 6-8 annual exhibitions at 26 Wooster Street, 4-6 annual exhibitions in the Wooster Street Windows Gallery, and multiple weekend exhibitions and drawing workshops at its Prince Street Project Space at 127b Prince Street in [[SoHo]]. The Museum's exhibitions are organized by Guest Curators who submit proposals which are reviewed by the Museum Director and Exhibition Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.leslielohman.org/get-involved/Guidelines_for_Proposing_an%20Exhibition_to_Leslie-Lohman%20Museum_of_Gay_and_Lesbian_Art.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726041157/https://www.leslielohman.org/get-involved/Guidelines_for_Proposing_an%20Exhibition_to_Leslie-Lohman%20Museum_of_Gay_and_Lesbian_Art.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Museum offers a complete year-round schedule of educational programing, including talks, lectures ([[Slava Mogutin]], [[Duane Michals]], [[Catherine Opie]], [[Jonathan David Katz]], etc.), films and books signings.&lt;ref name="Genre" /&gt; The LLGAF also publishes [https://web.archive.org/web/20101226071007/http://www.leslielohman.org/MainPgs/Journal1.html ''The Archive''] made available to its membership that includes information on the Leslie-Lohman collection, new acquisitions, events, and articles on artists and exhibitions. The Museum has a library with more than 2,500 volumes on gay art and maintains files on more than 2,000 individual artists. The Museum has begun to travel its exhibitions as its 2013 ''[[Sascha Schneider]]'' exhibition traveled to the [[Schwules Museum]] in Berlin. The Museum's ''Classical Nude: The Making of Queer History'' was on preview at the [[ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives]] gallery in West Hollywood in the summer of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://one.usc.edu/the-classical-nude/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum makes objects in its collection available for loan to qualified organizations and in recent years has borrowed works from other institutions, including the [[Library of Congress]], [[Smithsonian Institution]]. [[New York Public Library]], [[The Andy Warhol Museum]], and other organizations.

==Governance and Finances==
The Leslie-Lohman Museum is governed by an independent Board of Directors. The Foundation employs a full-time staff, and relies on the assistance of volunteers to implement its programs.&lt;ref name="Genre" /&gt; The Museum also runs a Fellowship Program.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.leslielohman.org/get-involved/participate.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is financed by its endowment, contributions from private donors and foundations as well as a membership program. The Foundation expands its collection primarily by donations from artists and collectors. It files an IRS 990 tax return each year.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

This is a list of notable [[implementation]]s of the [[Fizz Buzz]] game.
The task to come up with an implementation for this game is hardly a challenge for routined programmers and therefore often used as [[resume screening|screening]] test in interview situations.

== Fizz Buzz implementations by programming language ==

=== C ===
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c"&gt;
void fizzbuzz()
{
	int i;

	for (i = 1; i &lt;= 100; i++) {
		if (i % 3 &amp;&amp; i % 5)
			printf("%d", i);
		if (i % 3 == 0)
			printf("Fizz");
		if (i % 5 == 0)
			printf("Buzz");
		putchar(' ');
	}
	putchar('\n');
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A shorter and faster version:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c"&gt;
static const char *vals[] = {
	"%d ", "%d ", "Fizz ", "%d ", "Buzz ", "Fizz ", "%d ", "%d ",
	"Fizz ", "Buzz ", "%d ", "Fizz ", "%d ", "%d ", "FizzBuzz "
};

void fizzbuzz()
{
	for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++)
		printf(vals[i % 15], i+1);
	putchar('\n');
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== JavaScript ===
A details version using [[JavaScript]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="javascript"&gt;
// Initialize a string variable for the output
var output = '';

// Count to 100 using i as the counter
for (var i = 1; i &lt;= 100; i++) {

    // If i is not divisible by 3 or 5, append the number itself.
    // Note: In JavaScript, non-zero integers are considered as
    // truthy values, therefore if there's a remainder on both,
    // we append the number instead.
    if (i % 5 &amp;&amp; i % 3) {
        output += i + ' ';
    }

    // If i is divisible by 3 with no remainder, append Fizz
    if (i % 3 === 0) {
        output += 'Fizz ';
    }

    // If i is divisible by 5 with no remainder, append Buzz
    if (i % 5 === 0) {
        output += 'Buzz ';
    }
}

// Print the output to the console
console.log(output);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A shorter version:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="javascript"&gt;
var o='';
for (var i=1; i&lt;=100; i++) {
    i%3 || (o+='Fizz ');
    i%5 || (o+='Buzz ');
    !(i%3 &amp;&amp; i%5) || (o+=(i+' ')); 
}
console.log(o);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===C#===
An implementation in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="C#"&gt;
class Program
{
    public void FizzBuzzGo()
    {
        Boolean Fizz = false;
        Boolean Buzz = false;
        for (int count = 1; count &lt;= 100; count++)
        {
            Fizz = count % 3 == 0;
            Buzz = count % 5 == 0;
            if (Fizz &amp;&amp; Buzz)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Fizz Buzz");
            }
            else if (Fizz)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Fizz");
            }
            else if (Buzz)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Buzz");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine(count);
            }
        }
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Elixir===
An implementation in [[Elixir (programming language)]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="Elixir"&gt;
defmodule FizzBuzz do
  defp fizbuzz(0,0,_), do: "FizzBuzz"
  defp fizbuzz(0,_,_), do: "Fizz"    
  defp fizbuzz(_,0,_), do: "Buzz"    
  defp fizbuzz(_,_,n), do: n
  def fizbuzz(n), do: f1(rem(n,3), rem(n,5), n)
end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===F#===
An implementation in [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]]
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="javascript"&gt;
let to_string i = match i%3, i%5 with
    | 0,0 -&gt; "FizzBuzz"
    | 0,_ -&gt; "Fizz"
    | _,0 -&gt; "Buzz"
    | _ -&gt; string i

for i in 1..100 do
    printfn "%s" (to_string i)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===C++===
Using template metaprogramming in [[C++]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="C++"&gt;
// Helper macros to make compiler output a bit more readable, but keep the
// source readable too.
#define List _
#define Integer __

template &lt;int Condition, typename A, typename B&gt;
struct If;

template &lt;typename A, typename B&gt;
struct If&lt;true, A, B&gt; {
  typedef A result;
};

template &lt;typename A, typename B&gt;
struct If&lt;false, A, B&gt; {
  typedef B result;
};

struct Nil {};
struct Fizz {};
struct Buzz {};
struct FizzBuzz {};
template &lt;int N&gt;
struct Integer {
  static const int value = N;
};

template &lt;typename Head, typename Rest&gt;
struct List {
  typedef Head head;
  typedef Rest rest;
};

template &lt;typename Container, typename Value&gt;
struct PushFront {
  typedef List&lt;Value, Container&gt; result;
};

template &lt;int N&gt;
struct IntToFizzBuzz {
  typedef typename If&lt;
      N % 15 == 0, FizzBuzz,
      typename If&lt;N % 3 == 0, Fizz, typename If&lt;N % 5 == 0, Buzz, Integer&lt;N&gt;&gt;::
                                        result&gt;::result&gt;::result result;
};

template &lt;int N&gt;
struct DoFizzBuzz {
  typedef typename PushFront&lt;typename IntToFizzBuzz&lt;N&gt;::result,
                             typename DoFizzBuzz&lt;N - 1&gt;::result&gt;::result result;
};

template &lt;&gt;
struct DoFizzBuzz&lt;0&gt; {
  typedef Nil result;
};

template &lt;typename T&gt;
struct Print;

===Perl 6===
A FizzBuzzWoof implementation in [[Perl 6]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="perl6"&gt;
my @numbers = (0..1000);
for @numbers -&gt; $x {
    given $x {
        when $x %% 105 {
            say "FizzBuzzWoof"
        }
        when $x %% 15 {
            say "FizzBuzz"
        }
        when $x %% 21 {
            say "FizzWoof"
        }
        when $x %% 35 {
            say "BuzzWoof"
        }
        when $x %% 3 {
            say "Fizz"
        }
        when $x %% 5 {
            say "Buzz"
        }
        when $x %% 7 {
            say "Woof"
        }
        default {
            say $x
        }
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Python===
As a [[One-liner program|one-liner]] in [[Python (programming language)|Python 2]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="python"&gt;
print ['Fizz' * (i%3 &lt; 1) + 'Buzz' * (i%5 &lt; 1) or i for i in range(1,101)]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The one-liner needs to be slightly modified for [[Python (programming language)|Python 3]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="python"&gt;
print(['Fizz' * (i%3 &lt; 1) + 'Buzz' * (i%5 &lt; 1) or i for i in range(1, 101)])
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Kotlin===
An implementation in [[Kotlin (programming language)|Kotlin]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="kotlin"&gt;
fun fizzBuzz() {
    for(i in 1..100) {
        val fizz = i % 3 == 0
        val buzz = i % 5 == 0
        
    	println(when {
            fizz &amp;&amp; buzz -&gt; "FizzBuzz"
            fizz         -&gt; "Fizz"
            buzz         -&gt; "Buzz"
            else         -&gt; i
        })
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A more general version, which allows user defined conditions:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="kotlin"&gt;
fun generalFizzBuzz(end: Int, vararg conditions: Pair&lt;Int, String&gt;) {
    for(i in 1..end) {
        val words = conditions.filter { i % it.first == 0 }
        			    	  .joinToString("") { it.second }
        
        println(when(words) {
            ""   -&gt; i
            else -&gt; words
        })
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Elm===
An implementation in [[Elm (programming language)|Elm]] that produces HTML output:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="elm"&gt;
fizzBuzzHelper : Int -&gt; String
fizzBuzzHelper x =
    let
        byThree = modBy 3 x == 0
        byFive  = modBy 5 x == 0
    in
        if      byThree &amp;&amp; byFive then "FizzBuzz"
        else if byThree           then "Fizz"
        else if byFive            then "Buzz"
        else                           String.fromInt x

            
fizzBuzz : Html Msg
fizzBuzz = div []
           &lt;| List.concatMap (\s -&gt; [ text s, Html.br [] [] ])
           &lt;| List.map fizzBuzzHelper (List.range 0 256)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''Live Arts Week'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liveartsweek.it Live Arts Week]&lt;/ref&gt; is a project by Xing, born in 2012 out the fusion of the experiences of the two Bologna festivals (2000&gt;2011): [[Netmage]] - International Live Media Festival and [[F.I.S.Co.]] - Festival Internazionale sullo Spettacolo Contemporaneo.
Live Arts Week takes place in [[Bologna]], Italy, once a year, and it is developed throughout one week in different locations and settings in town.

==Mission==

Event dedicated to live arts, it hosts a blend of artworks and productions that revolve around the presence, performance and perceptual experience of sounds and visions, with a program of live works (performances, environments, concerts, live media, expanded cinema) presented by important personalities in the international and contemporary research scene. The set-up suggests a citywide event, involving several spaces, organizations and institutions active in the field of contemporary arts in Bologna.

'''Nora Barnacle''' (21 March 1884 – 10 April 1951) was the [[Artistic inspiration|muse]] and wife of Irish author [[James Joyce]].

Barnacle and Joyce had their first romantic assignment on a date celebrated worldwide as the ‘Bloomsday’ of his modernist novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', a book that she did not, however, enjoy. Their sexually explicit letters have aroused much curiosity, especially as Joyce normally disapproved of coarse language, and they fetch high prices at auction. 

Barnacle was played by [[Susan Lynch]] in the 1999 bio-pic ''[[Nora (2000 film)|Nora]]''.

==Early life==
{{redirect|Michael Bodkin|the GAA referee|Michael Bodkin (referee)}}
Barnacle was born in [[Galway]] [[workhouse]] on 21 March 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://civilrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/images/birth_returns/births_1884/02698/1993624.pdf|title=General Registrar's Office|website=IrishGenealogy.ie|access-date=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her entry in the birth register, which gives her first name as "Norah", is dated 22 March. Her father, Thomas Barnacle, a baker in [[Connemara]], was an illiterate man who was 38 years old when she was born. Her mother, Annie Honoria Healy, was 28 and worked as a dressmaker.

Between 1886 and 1889, Barnacle's parents sent her to live with her maternal grandmother, Catherine Mortimer Healy. During these years, she began studies at a convent, eventually graduating from a national school in 1891. In 1896, Barnacle completed her schooling and began to work as a porteress and laundress. In the same year, her mother threw her father out for drinking and the couple separated. Barnacle went to live with her mother and her uncle, Tom Healy, at 4 Bowling Green, Galway.

In 1896, at age 12, Barnacle fell in love with a teenager named [[Michael Feeney (schoolteacher)|Michael Feeney]], who died soon after of [[typhoid]] and [[pneumonia]]. In a dramatic coincidence, another boy she loved, Michael Bodkin, died in 1900 – causing some of her friends to call her "man-killer." Joyce later based the final short story in ''[[Dubliners]]'', "[[The Dead (short story)|The Dead]]", on these incidents. It was rumoured that she sought comfort from her friend, budding English theatre starlet, Laura London, who introduced her to a Protestant named [[Willie Mulvagh]]. In 1903, she left Galway after her uncle learned of the affair and friendship, and went to [[Dublin]] where she worked as a [[maid|chambermaid]] at Finn's Hotel (later the name of the hotel was used as the title for a posthumously-published collection of ten short narrative pieces written by Joyce, ''[[Finn's Hotel]]'', in 2013).&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/14/james-joyce-collection-published James Joyce's 'last undiscovered' collection to be published | Books | theguardian.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with Joyce==
Barnacle met Joyce on 10 June 1904 while still in Dublin and they had their first romantic liaison on 16 June. Joyce later chose 16 June 1904 as the date for the setting for his novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' and the date has come to be known and celebrated around the world as [[Bloomsday]]. The 1904 rendezvous began a long relationship that eventually led to marriage in 1931&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=James (Augustine Aloysius) Joyce Biography (1882–1941) | url =https://www.biography.com/people/james-joyce-9358676 | accessdate = 8 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued until Joyce's death.

Barnacle's and Joyce's relationship was complex. They had different personalities, tastes and cultural interests. Of their first meeting, she recalled: "I mistook him for a Swedish sailor – His electric blue eyes, yachting cap and [[Plimsoll shoe|plimsolls]]. But when he spoke, well then, I knew him at once for just another Dublin [[jackeen]] chatting up a country girl."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Joyce: a graphic guide|last1=Norris |first1=David |last2=Flint |first2=Carl |publisher=Icon Books Ltd|year=1994|isbn=978-184831-351-4|location=London|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numerous erotic letters they exchanged suggest they loved each other passionately.&lt;ref name="Maddox - Guardian 2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jul/09/books.booksnews|title=Ah yes – but what ever happened to Nora's side of the correspondence?|last=Maddox|first=Brenda|date=8 July 2004|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are also of interest because of Joyce’s lifelong dislike of swearing and crude language.&lt;ref&gt;://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3877209.stm&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce seems to have admired and trusted her, and Barnacle clearly loved Joyce and trusted him enough to agree to leave Ireland with him for the Continent. In anticipation of the move to Paris, she began studying French and Barnacle cooked English puddings at Joyce's request during their travels.

In 1904, Barnacle and Joyce left Ireland for continental Europe and the following year set up house in [[Trieste]] (at that time in [[Austria-Hungary]]). On 27 June 1905, Nora Barnacle gave birth to a son, Giorgio and later to a daughter, [[Lucia Joyce|Lucia]], on 26 July 1907. A miscarriage in 1908 coincided with the beginning of a difficult time for both. Though she remained by his side, and the couple were legally married in London in 1931, she complained to her sister both about his personal qualities and his writings.

In these letters to her sister, she said he drank too much and wasted too much money. As for his literary activity, she lamented that his writings were obscure and lacking in sense. She was always fiercely proud of him, although she occasionally expressed impatience at his meetings with other artists and admitted she would have preferred him had he been a musician—in his youth, he was a talented singer—rather than a writer.

Lucia's mental illness, which became acute in the early 1930s, posed another challenge to the couple's relationship. Nora believed the condition required hospitalisation, which Joyce opposed. They brought in many specialists, and Lucia was for a time the patient of [[Carl Jung]]. She was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]] and admitted to a clinic in 1936. Her father visited her there often, but not her mother. As Nora's biographer Brenda Maddox recorded, 'Lucia was rarely out of Nora's mind. Because she had aroused Lucia's most florid schizophrenic reactions, Nora was not allowed to accompany Joyce on his ritual Sunday afternoon visits to Ivry. Not only did this exclude her from any contact with her daughter, it also required her to spend much of each week arranging for someone to accompany Joyce, who could not easily go alone... Joyce liked to portray himself as safe from Lucia's violence, as if he was the only other permitted inhabitant of her private world. Yet once when Giorgio went with his father, Lucia saw them and cried, 'Che bello! Che bello!' then lunged and tried to strangle them.' As Maddox also noted, 'There is no record that Nora ever saw her daughter again.'{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Later life and death==

After Joyce's death in [[Zurich]] in 1941, Nora decided to remain there. She died in Zurich of [[acute renal failure]] in 1951, at age 67.

==Maddox biography==
{{main|Nora (2000 film)}}

In 1988, Nora Barnacle was the subject of a biography by [[Brenda Maddox]], ''Nora: A Biography of Nora Joyce''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Brenda|last= Maddox|title=Nora: Biography of Nora Joyce|publisher= Hamish Hamilton |year=1988|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QtRaAAAAMAAJ|isbn=9780241123850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This in turn was made into a film in 1999, directed by Pat Murphy and starring [[Susan Lynch]] and [[Ewan McGregor]].

==Auction of letter from Joyce to Nora==
In 2004, an erotic letter from Joyce to Barnacle sold at [[Sotheby's]] for £240,800, a record amount for a modern-day letter at auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Joyce letter smashes sale record | date=8 July 2004 | publisher =BBC News | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3877209.stm | accessdate = 17 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of musical CDs have been created for the media franchise built around [[Eiichirō Oda]]'s [[manga]] ''[[One Piece]]''. Various [[theme music|theme songs]] and [[character song]]s were released on a total of 49 [[Single (music)|singles]]. Many of them were also released in collected form on the eight [[compilation album]]s or the 16 [[soundtrack]] CDs, along with background music from the anime television series, the series' feature films, and video games.

The anime television series currently consists of 36 pieces of theme music; eighteen opening themes and eighteen ending themes. As of episode 279, ending themes were omitted and, starting from episode 326 onwards, opening themes were extended from 110 seconds long to 150 seconds long. In episodes 1-206 of [[Funimation]]'s English-language release of the series, the opening and ending themes were dubbed into English by various voice actors, before reverting to the Japanese versions from episodes 207 onwards.

The sub-lists on compilation albums and singles list the releases peak position in [[Oricon]]'s weekly charts as well as the length of the release's chart run in weeks.

[[File:Materia Medica (Arabic translation, leaf).jpg|thumb|''Physician Preparing an Elixir'']]
The '''''Physician Preparing an Elixir''''' is a miniature on a folio from an illustrated manuscript copy, now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York of ''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De Materia Medica]]'', a large [[herbal]] or work on the (mostly) medical uses of plants originally written by the ancient Greco-Roman physician, [[Pedanius Dioscorides]], in the first century AD. This page of the manuscript, dated 1224 AD, is made from paper, sized 24.8&amp;nbsp;cm wide and 33.2&amp;nbsp;cm long, and is decorated by opaque watercolor, ink, and gold detailing. It is visually split into three horizontal portions from the top of the page to the bottom; the top of the page is dominated by two lines of Arabic script, followed by the image and then five more lines of text in Arabic. The writing below the image is predominantly black with the exception of one line, which is written in red ink and is therefore highlighted to the viewer. The page is usually not on display.

Experts believe that the image was made in Iraq, Northern Jazira or Baghdad. Its Middle Eastern origin is corroborated with the physician’s appearance. In the image, he is wearing a headscarf, his clothing is quite colorful and it is detailed with gold decorations. Additionally, the Arabic text is a further indication that this specific page was formed in a Middle Eastern context.  In this digital representation, the page looks to be in great condition and has minimal wear and tear.

==Brief History of the Materia Medica==

The term Materia Medica refers to both a specific text and a genre of texts, a complication illustrated by the diverse history of the original book. Pedanius Dioscorides was a Greek physician, the word here used in the medieval sense, born in 40 A.D. who spent multiple years traveling with the Roman Emperor Nero’s army. During these travels, Dioscorides gathered herbal samples and collected knowledge on the practical health uses of plants, amassing notes on over one thousand medicinal substances.  In 70 A.D., Dioscorides published De Materia Medica or “On Medicinal Substances” in his native language, Greek. The Materia Medica detailed “plant names, synonyms and illustrations; plant habitat and botanical descriptions; properties, actions and uses of the drug; negative side effects, if any; administration and dosage recommendations; directions on harvesting, preparation and storage of herbs or drugs; possible adulterations and how they're detected; and the veterinary uses of the drug or herb, if any.”   The text was published in five volumes and was eventually translated into multiple languages, including Latin and Arabic. This text went on to serve as a central source for knowledge on herbs and similar medical substances. As it traveled to new areas and was handed down through different leaders and dynasties, it was modified, rearranged and added to with the knowledge of those places. Therefore, this page in this Materia Medica is not identical to the original by Dioscoride or other surviving copies.

==History of the specific object==
[[File:Pedanius Dioscorides - Folio from an Arabic translation of the Materia Medica by Dioscorides - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|A man bitten by a [[rabies|rabid]] dog, another page from the same manuscript]]
In 1913, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, New York received the folio came to the MMA after a history of European ownership. As far as the records show, this page of the manuscript was first collected by F. R. Martin of Stockholm in 1910. F.R. Martin also originally possessed additional folios that came from other copies of Dioscorides’ Materia Medica such as the image titled “Men Stepping on Grapes” which is now also at the MMA.  The central folio page, “Physician Preparing an Elixir,” was then moved to the care of Georges. J. Demotte in Paris until 1913 when it was officially acquired by the museum. Demotte was a Belgian-born Parisian art dealer of the late 19th to early 20th century who also gave many different art and archaeological finds to the Metropolitan Museum. Demotte has become known for his acquisition of the Islamic “Book of Kings” or the Shahnameh, which he sold page by page to different interested parties.

The fact that this page is from a highly translated text, De Materia Medica, may distort some of our analysis due to the great changes a literary work undergoes during translation.  As the Materia Medica became widely spread and translated into multiple languages, this page and others may have traveled with physicians or along trade routes to reach new destinations and communities. Therefore, this text, as illustrated by its aesthetic and geographical origins in the Middle East, could display a very different side of the Materia Medica genre. It is possible that this page was an addition, performed by Middle Eastern physicians, in the 13th century and did not exist as a part of the early Materia Medica’s during the time of Dioscoride. Additionally, though the original five-volume text was an assemblage of information, perhaps for the aim of practical instruction, this page seems to diverge from that initial focus. It is esthetically pleasing, apparently quite valuable as shown by the gold detailing, and overall, seems to have been a precious object as shown by the minimal wear and tear depicted on its page on the MMA website. Therefore, one can assume that at least this page was not a highly circulated text within the Middle Eastern community. Perhaps this text was kept among scholars and through this seclusion in academic society, remained in good condition.

==Context==
The physician is surrounded by multiple different tools, perhaps signifying the importance of such inventions during the time this manuscript page was created. The physician is sitting on a stool and is making an elixir in a medium-sized pot using a mixing tool. He is seated in front of a medieval contraption that could have been used for filtering or other processes. To the far left of the image, on the other side of the potential filtering tool, there is a large blue jug. The prominence of these tools, perhaps important to the physician’s preparation of the elixir, are highlighted by their placement and coloring on the page.

Additionally, the depiction of the physician in this text could illustrate the place of physicians in society in the Middle East during this time period. As previously explained, this text could have been an object of Middle Eastern academic society. Physicians in the 13th century were highly respected members of society as they were viewed as learned men. They were taught in the intricacies of humoral theory and were charged with the health of many communities. The physician in this image, demonstrated by the elaborate coloring of his shirt and its implications for his high social class, could be the depiction of an ideal. This man could be a representation of the  “ideal Middle Eastern 13th century physician,” a man of ingenuity with his tools, knowledge of plants and herbs, and high social status. Yet, internal to this interpretation is a contradiction as the high society physician would also not be found working in such an outdoor environment. This physician would instead be found in a more scholarly/academic environment for this time period as the physicians of the 13th century were more invested in humoral theory than in herbs and plants. Therefore, the "physician" in this text could represent the work of an herbalist of this time period as opposed to a physician.  In this way, the page “Physician Preparing an Elixir” may display not only the great herbal and medical knowledge dating back to Dioscoride’s trips with [[Nero]], but also the changing depiction of medical and societal ideals, all found within the same, diverse manuscript.

'''Postmodern Marketing''' is a term derived from [[postmodern]] philosophical movements where there are cultural tendencies of inherent suspicion towards a global cultural narrative or meta-narrative.  Postmodern marketing takes this same philosophical perspective and applies it to the way [[advertising]] initiatives are handled in the current post-World War II era.  Postmodern marketing is approaching or has passed through a new era in [[advertising]], [[Brand management|branding]], and strategic [[brand]] thinking.&lt;ref name="dmarson-pg226"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Black Well Encyclopedia of Management |last=Marson |first=David J. |year=2011 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |location=Malden, Mass. |isbn= 978-0-631-23317-6 |page=226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodern marketing is inherently focused on customized experiences where broad market generalizations are no-longer applied or implemented on behalf of branded communications.&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg19"&gt;{{Cite book|title="Postmodern Marketing?",|last=Brown |first=Steven |year=1993 |publisher=European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 27 Iss: 4|pages=19–34 |issn=0309-0566 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the technique requires marketers to remove "new aged adlandia" trends and developments to focus on how the consumer prefers to be messaged to.

As a result, the ad aged "art and science" debate around [[creativity|creative]], [[Advertising#Media|media]], [[marketing]] and [[Brand management|branding]] are put to an end.  With a postmodern marketing approach a one-to-one communication is created between real humans, controlling real mouses, real computers, real keyboards and real [[mobile telephones]].

== Origins ==
The development of postmodern marketing is built on the foundations of modern marketing (with analysis, planning, implementation and control deeply rooted in its process).&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg19"/&gt;   Postmodern marketing however, acts more of a collection of approaches in the need to stay nimble, reactive and able to engage and shift with consumers from a non-definitive point of view.  Postmodern marketing saw great acceptance in the early 1990s with the emerging developments of the [[Splinternet]] and marketers realization that "traditional" strategic practices like Porters five forces, the Wheel of Retailing, and the Boston Matrix had become outdated and not able to keep up with or report on consumer media habits, creative tone, and umbrella [[Brand management|branding]] techniques.&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg19"/&gt;   As a result, postmodern marketing was born.

== Three Categories of Postmodern Marketing ==
Although the exact origins of the term is unknown, scholarly reports date the defining of the movement to the early 1990s by the "European Journal of Marketing" author Stephen Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/fast-company-staff/fast-company-blog/post-modern-marketing |title=Post-Modern Marketing |publisher=FastCompany.com |date=2006-09-19 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his findings, postmodern marketing is made up of three distinct categories (1) the idea of change, new, and complex, (2) sub-discipline of consumer research, and (3) marketing practices and research methodologies.   Furthermore, as Brown implies, one who approaches marketing from postmodern style should in many ways reject attempts to impost order and working in silos.  Instead markers should work collectively from with "artistic" attributes of intuition, creativity, spontaneity, speculation, emotion and involvement.&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg19"/&gt;

=== The Idea of Change, New and Complex ===

The idea of change is a deeply rooted philosophy when studying postmodern marketing.  When planning and strategizing within the "new now" or the "new new now" of media, technical services and creative styling a practitioner within the space must be comfortable with new and more complex systems and created worlds, platform and messaging structures.  Fundamentally grounded on dramatic political and economic pressures the changing landscape illustrated the need to be nimble, direct and personalized communication and a high concern for [[personally identifiable information]].&lt;ref name="styler"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Unspeakable: Discourse, Dialogue, and Rhetoric in the Postmodern World (Rhetoric of Human Sciences) |last=Tyler |first=Stephen J. |year=1987 |publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Pr |location= Madison, Wisconsin |isbn=978-0-299-11274-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sub-discipline of Consumer Research ===

To adjust with shifts in consumer consumption habits, postmodern [[marketing]] has created new disciplines to better sample, survey and poll target [[consumer group]] to better align with habit, preference and beliefs.  Many call this shift a "naturalistic" or interpretive" approach,  which mainly emerged from the control of non-renewable resources.

=== Marketing Practices and Research Methodologies ===

Outcomes of redefined consumer research studies are newly defined approaches to marketing and media disciplines.  Although some of these disciplines may be out dated, they illustrate core differences between postmodern marketing and modern marketing methodologies.&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg19"/&gt;

These approaches to marketing suggest that the role of a [[brand manager]], digital agency, creative, [[media planner]], account director, etc. is only defined by the [[company culture|company's culture]] that they in.  Hence, a postmodern marketer is one who approaches marketing and advertising campaigns with a "thinker marker" mentality.  Where they pull in and emphasize the need for creative relevance, companion [[Advertising#Media|media]], collateral activation, social engagement, and most importantly have the means to pull it all together.  Many believe that a postmodern marketing approach creates greater efficiencies, order, opportunity and a chance to gain real world insights from the perspective of the consumer.  As a result, postmodern [[marketing]] like postmodernality stands as a transitory phase in 21st centuryvertising and has ushered in an era of styles and nimble techniques.

== Myths ==
Postmodern marketing is not the same as "non-traditional" or [[digital marketing]]. It is instead made up only of new aged media engagements brought about by the developments like that of the iPad.

Social media belongs to the young.  According to Sean Carton writer of ClickZ, the idea of social media belonging to only the young is, "Baloney".  With the accelerated growth of account activation amongst the 55+ age cohort according to leading marketing research firms like [[Forrester Research|Forrester]], [[eMarketer]], [[comScore]] and [[Nielsen Company|Nielsen]], the idea of social media belonging to only the young Republicans is an inaccurate statement of fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/1709224/-post-modern-marketing-myths-busted |title=Postmodern Marketing Myths: Busted |publisher=ClickZ.com |date=2010-06-07 |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conditions ==
According to many scholastic journals, postmodern marketing hinges on and has aided to the development of many changes to the current marketing model.  Some of the more renowned conditions that postmodern marketing is known to influence and disrupt are :&lt;ref name="ffuat-pg40"&gt;{{Cite book|title="Marketing In  Postmodern World",|last=Fuat |first=Firat |year=1993 |publisher=European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 29 Iss: 1|pages=40–56 |issn=0309-0566 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Hyper reality:''' Relating to simulations or simulated experiences.  Tourist attractions, amusement parks and "subculture" vacation destinations are known for their ability in creating hyper-real "immersive worlds".
* '''Fragmentation:''' Adheres to many marketing disciplines.  These being media space, consumer attention, consumption habits, and communication/messaging strategies.
* '''Reversals of production and consumption:''' A condition that occurs when the roles of consumer and marketer change.  This is when consumers become "brand ambassadors" for a company and voice concern, opinion and align their beliefs with that of the brand through a number of traditional and non-traditional media channels.
* '''Decentering of the subject:''' Occurs when a brand personifies the product or service being marketed.  As a result, the promoted item become a "Hero" or a new-age savior.
* '''Paradoxical juxtaposition:''' The ultimate state of postmodern marketing.  This condition allows consumers and brand managers to act in the moment and adjust to changing landscapes, tone, pressure, and emotional cues.  As a result, they are able to represent a different self-image and avoid moments of conformity to single, set brand guidelines, perceived reputations and roles.
* '''Loss of commitment:'''  An outcome of many postmodern marketing experiences can result in loss of commitment amongst brand ambassadors and loyalists.  This is usually driven from the inability for brand managers to adhere to or recreate the level of consumer engagement needed retain the same level of consumer interest and interaction.

In 2000, [[Billy Childish]] and [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]], founders of the [[stuckism]] art movement instigated remodernism,&lt;ref name=packer/&gt; with a manifesto, ''Remodernism'' in an attempt to introduce a period of new spirituality into art, culture and society to replace postmodernism, which they said was cynical and spiritually bankrupt. In 2002, a remodernism art show in [[Albuquerque]] was accompanied by an essay from [[University of California, Berkeley]] art professor, Kevin Radley, who said there was a renewal of artists working without the limitation of irony and cynicism, and that there was a renewal of the sense of beauty.

In 2006, the [[Stedelijk Museum]] and the [[University of Amsterdam]] held a talk on remodernism with Daniel Birnbaum and Alison Gingeras; the introduction to this talked of the revival of painting as a possible return to traditional modernist values, such as [[Authenticity in art|authenticity]], self-expression and autonomy, as opposed to multimedia practice.
&lt;ref name=amsterdam/&gt; In 2008, London ''[[Evening Standard]]'' critic, Ben Lewis, applied the term to three [[Turner Prize]] nominees and saw them amongst a movement which was reviving the formalism of the early 20th century; he advocated values of an aesthetic informed by modesty, generosity and genuine emotion.&lt;ref name=lewis-turner/&gt;

==History==
[[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]] and [[Billy Childish]], the founders of the [[stuckism]] art movement, inaugurated the period of remodernism.&lt;ref name=packer&gt;Packer, William. "Childish artists coming unstuck", p.13, and "Young pretenders of art have much to learn", p. 20, ''[[Financial Times]]'', March 13, 2001. The text from different editions is the same: "Childish and his co-founder, Charles Thomson, ushered in remodernism, 'a period of art . . . to reclaim the vision and spiritual values of the early Modernists and replace the ennui of Post-Modernism'."&lt;/ref&gt; Their ''Remodernism'' manifesto was published on March 1, 2000 to promote vision, authenticity and self-expression, with an emphasis on painting, and subtitled "towards a new spirituality in art." Its premise is that the potential of the [[Modernism|modernist]] vision has not been fulfilled, that its development has been in the wrong direction and that this vision needs to be reclaimed, redefined and redeveloped. It advocates the search for truth, knowledge and meaning, and challenges [[formalism (art)|formalism]].

|colspan="2"|&lt;small&gt;In 1999, Childish and Thomson wrote a remodernism manifesto, calling for a period of new spirituality in art, culture and society to replace [[postmodernism]].&lt;/small&gt;
|}

It has a short introduction, summing up: "Modernism has progressively lost its way, until finally toppling into the bottomless pit of Postmodern balderdash." This is followed by 14 numbered points, stressing bravery, individuality, inclusiveness, communication, humanity and the perennial against nihilism, scientific materialism and the "brainless destruction of convention." Point 7 states:
{{quote|Spirituality is the journey of the soul on earth. Its first principle is a declaration of intent to face the truth. Truth is what it is, regardless of what we want it to be. Being a spiritual artist means addressing unflinchingly our projections, good and bad, the attractive and the grotesque, our strengths as well as our delusions, in order to know ourselves and thereby our true relationship with others and our connection to the divine.}}
Point 9 states: "Spiritual art is not religion. Spirituality is humanity's quest to understand itself and finds its symbology through the clarity and integrity of its artists." Point 12 links its use of the word "God" to enthusiasm&amp;mdash;from the Greek root ''en theos'' (to be possessed by God).

The summary at the end starts, "It is quite clear to anyone of an uncluttered mental disposition that what is now put forward, quite seriously, as art by the ruling elite, is proof that a seemingly rational development of a body of ideas has gone seriously awry," and finds the solution is a spiritual renaissance because "there is nowhere else for art to go. Stuckism's mandate is to initiate that spiritual renaissance now."&lt;ref&gt;Childish, Billy, and Thomson, Charles. [http://www.stuckism.com/remod.html "Remodernism"], stuckism.com, March 1, 2000.

Childish and Thomson sent their remodernism manifesto to [[Nicholas Serota|Sir Nicholas Serota]], Director of the [[Tate Gallery]], who replied, "You will not be surprised to learn that I have no comment to make on your letter, or your manifesto ''Remodernism''."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021221052217/http://www.hatii.arts.gla.ac.uk/MultimediaStudentProjects/00-01/9704524l/MM%20Project/Html/stuck2.htm "Stuck on the Turner Prize: Send in the clowns"], [[University of Glasgow]].

In March 2000 the [[Stuckism|Stuckists]] declared themselves to be the first remodernist art group at a show ''The Resignation of Sir Nicholas Serota''. In April, remodernism was quoted in ''The Gulf News'' ([[UAE]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lethbridge, Lucy (2000)[&lt;!--http://www.gulf-news.co.ae/18042000/FRIDAY/fri6.htm DEAD LINK REPLACED WITH INTERNET ARCHIVE CACHE --&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20010222155937/http://www.gulf-news.co.ae/18042000/FRIDAY/fri6.htm "Letter from London"] ''The Gulf News'', May 14, 2000. Accessed April 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In May ''The Observer'' newspaper announced a stuckist show: "As the founding group of a self-named art movement called Remodernism, they stand on an art ticket that's against clever conceptualism and in favour of a more emotional and spiritual integrity in art via figurative painting."&lt;ref&gt;Sumpter, Helen (2000)[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/life/story/0,,220529,00.html "Go see... the Stuckists"] ''The Observer'', May 14, 2000. Accessed April 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, Thomson and Childish gave a talk on stuckism and remodernism at the Salon des Arts, Kensington, promoted by the [[Institute of Ideas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Vine1/Salon.html "Stella Vine meets (and joins) the Stuckists"] stuckism.com. Accessed April 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The same month the "Students for Stuckism" also gave "a Remodernist show and talk." The Institute of Remodernism was founded by Dr Khatereh Ahmadi.

In 2001, Thomson stood in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|UK general election]], stating, "The Stuckist Party aims to bring the ideas of Stuckism and Remodernism into the political arena."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/e01/man/StuckManifesto2.pdf "The Stuckist Party: Manifesto 2001"] pdf accessed from Keele University website, April 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...there seems to be a re-emergence of confidence in the artist's singular voice&amp;mdash;a renewal of the belief that an artist can explore their own natures without the restraints of the ironic, the cynical or the didactic.

The show curator, Yoshimi Hayashi, said:
{{quote|ReMo incorporates ideas from Modernism, Avantegardism, and Post Modernism; thus synthesizing an alternative and real time contemporary approach to art. In ReMo, issues such as multiculturalism, irony, the sublime, and identity are considered; however, they do not become the art itself. The reconsideration and redefinition of the traditions are sought not by mere deconstructionism, but rather by connecting new nodes of ideas. Therefore, by definition, ReMo is fundamentally cellular and its roots stem from provincial art settings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020207064328/http://www.magnifico.org/exh_pgm/ReMo_2002.html "Magnífico presents ReMo"], Magnifico, 2002.

American film makers/photographers [[Jesse Richards]] and [[Harris Smith (filmmaker)|Harris Smith]] co-founded a new group [[remodernist film]] and photography with an emphasis on emotional meaning and characterised by elements of new-wave, no-wave, expressionist and transcendental film-making.

Stuckist artist [[Bill Lewis]], interviewed by the [[BBC]] at the 2004 [[Liverpool Biennial]], said that remodernism was "not a movement as such,"&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt; but a return to the start of modernism in order to move forward with an art for a new paradigm.&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt; To "remodernise" is to go "back to the root again, starting with painting ... and see where it goes."&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt; He said that this had been called reactionary, but it was radical "in the true sense of the word."&lt;ref name=lewis&gt;[[Bill Lewis|Lewis, Bill]].

In August 2006, an online group called "The Remodernists of Deviantart" was founded by Clay Martin. The group is composed of artists who are active on the website deviantart.com. 

In 2006, artist Matt Bray said, "I do not wish to be considered a Stuckist, as I find some of there (sic) antics unnecessary. The Stuckists are however the first and most famous Remodernist group, so for that, and for bringing this particular manifesto to my attention; I thank them."&lt;ref&gt;Bray, Matt (2006)[http://www.artnowuk.com/ "Art Portal: Matt Bray 2006"] artnow.uk.com.

{{quote|The Japanese ideas of [[wabi-sabi]] (the beauty of imperfection) and [[mono no aware]] (the awareness of the transience of things and the bittersweet feelings that accompany their passing), have the ability to show the truth of existence, and should always be considered when making the remodernist film.&lt;ref name="When The Trees Were Still Real"&gt;[http://jesse-richards.blogspot.com/2008/08/remodernist-film-manifesto.html "Remodernist Film Manifesto", When The Trees Were Still Real, August 27, 2008] Retrieved September 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;}} Later, in 2009, in an essay on remodernist film for ''[[MungBeing]]'' magazine, Richards discussed Remodernism in relation to craft:
{{quote|Remodernism in general embraces the bravery of the amateur, so craft is a strange thing to think about. Craft is usually about something striving for perfection, without flaws, to be "professional". I don't like that. However if you consider craft something that can be developed and grown, I like that. I like the idea of filmmakers teaching themselves to paint pictures, to try acting in their own movies and those of others (especially if they are shy), to be nude models for other artists, to meditate, worship if they are religious, to do things that affect their levels of consciousness, try things that make them nervous or uncomfortable, to go out and be involved in life, to find adventure, to jump in the ocean. I think that is the exploration of craft.&lt;ref name=MungBeing&gt;[http://www.mungbeing.com/issue_28.html?page=32&amp;sub_id=1565#1565 "Remodernist Film", MungBeing, October 4, 2009] Retrieved October 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''stone ship''' or '''ship setting''' was an early burial custom in [[Scandinavia]], [[Northern Germany]] and the [[Baltic states]]. The grave or cremation burial was surrounded by slabs or stones in the shape of a ship. The ships vary in size and were erected from c. 1000 BC to 1000 AD.

== History ==
Stone ship were an early burial custom, characteristically Scandinavian but also found in Northern Germany and the Baltic states. The grave or cremation burial was surrounded by tightly or loosely fit slabs or stones in the outline of a ship. They are often found in [[grave field]]s, but are sometimes far from any other archaeological remains.

Ship settings are of varying sizes, some of monumental proportions. The largest known is the mostly destroyed [[Jelling stone ship]] in Denmark, which was at least {{convert|170|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. In Sweden, the size varies from {{convert|67|m|ft|abbr=on}} ([[Ale's Stones]]) to only a few metres. The orientation also varies. Inside, they can be cobbled or filled with stones, or have raised stones in the positions of masts. The illusion of being ships has often been reinforced by larger stones at the ends. Some have an oblique stern.

Scattered examples are found in Northern Germany and along the coast of the Baltic States. Excavations have shown that they are usually from the latter part of the [[Nordic Bronze Age]], c. 1000 BC – 500 BC (e.g. [[Gotland]]) or from the [[Germanic Iron Age]], the [[Vendel Period]] and the [[Viking Age]] (e.g. [[Blekinge]] and [[Scania]]).

Scholars have suggested both that the stone ship developed out of the desire to equip the dead with everything he had in life, and alternatively that it was specifically associated with the journey to [[Hel (location)|Hel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilda Ellis Davidson|Hilda Roderick Ellis]], ''The Road to Hel: A Study of the Conception of the Dead in Old Norse Literature'', Cambridge University, 1943, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aLA8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA111 pp. 28–29].&lt;/ref&gt; One puzzling feature is that they sometimes occur at the base of a barrow, enclosing a flat area presumably intended for public ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aLA8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA111 p. 111].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a paper published in 2012, Joseph S. Hopkins and Haukur Þorgeirsson propose a connection between stone ships and the image of a 'ship in a field' that the goddess [[Freyja]]'s afterlife locations [[Fólkvangr]] and [[Sessrúmnir]] considered together produce. According to Hopkins and Haukur, "'A ship in the field' in the mythical realm may have been conceived as a reflection of actual burial customs and vice versa. It is possible that the symbolic ship was thought of as providing some sort of beneficial property to the land, such as good seasons and peace brought on by Freyr’s mound burial in ''Ynglinga saga''."&lt;ref name="SHIP-IN-THE-FIELD"&gt;Hopkins, Joseph S. and Haukur Þorgeirsson (2012).

A '''stripped book''' is a [[mass market paperback]] that has been stripped of its cover in order to be [[Pulping|pulped]] and [[Paper recycling|recycled]] as a result of lack of sales. The covers are returned to the publisher as evidence that the books have been destroyed and the books are discarded or recycled into paper or cardboard products. However, some stripped books end up back on the marketplace, and are sold at places like [[flea markets]].

{{Politics of Mexico}}

The '''National Supreme Court of Justice''' ({{lang-es|Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación}} ('''SCJN''') is the Mexican institution serving as the country's federal [[high court]] and the spearhead organisation for the judiciary of the Mexican Federal Government. It consists of eleven [[magistrates]], known as ''ministers of the court'', one of whom is designated the court's ''president''.

Judges of the SCJN are appointed for 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;Article 94 Mexican Constitution&lt;/ref&gt; They are ratified through affirmation by the [[Mexican Senate|Senate]] from a list proposed by the [[President of Mexico|President of the Republic]]. The ministers chosen will select from among themselves who shall be the President of the Court to serve a four-year period; any given minister may serve out more than one term as president, but may not do so consecutively. 

==Requirements for holding a seat on the National Supreme Court of Justice==
* Be a natural born citizen of Mexico.
* Be at least 35 years old at the time of one's appointment
* Have held a Law degree for at least 10 years.
* To have a good reputation and have not have been convicted of theft, fraud, forgery, breach of trust, or any other offense which could imply a punishment of more than one year in prison.
* Not have been Director for Domestic Affairs, Chief of an Administrative Department, Attorney General of the Republic or Federal District Attorney, Senator, Member of Parliament, Governor of any State, or Chief Executive of the Federal District during the year prior to his or her appointment.

The Constitution requires that the appointment of ministers of the court should fall to those persons who have served ably, effectively and honourably in the administration of justice, or to those who have distinguished themselves by their honor, competence and professional background in the exercise of their duties.

Ministers may take leave of their posts for three reasons:
* The end of their terms
* Relinquishment, which is only allowed in serious cases, all of which must be affirmed by the President and accepted or discarded by the Senate.
* Voluntary retirement: Proceeds when the interested party requests their retirement, as long as they meet the conditions of age and seniority.

==Supreme Court building==

The court itself is located just off the [[Zocalo|main plaza]] of [[Mexico City]] on the corners of Pino Suarez and Carranza Streets. It was built between 1935 and 1941 by Antonio Muñoz Garcia. Prior to the [[Conquest of Mexico|Conquest]], this site was reserved for the ritual known as "[[Danza de los Voladores de Papantla|Dance of the Flyers]]" which is still practiced today in [[Papantla]]. [[Hernán Cortés]] claimed the property after the Conquest and its ownership was in dispute during much of the colonial period with Cortes' heirs, the city government, and the [[Royal and Pontifical University]] all claiming rights. It was also the site of a very large market known as El Volador.&lt;ref name="historic"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mexico City Historic Center |last= Galindo |first=Carmen |authorlink= |author2=Magdalena Galindo   |year=2002 |publisher=Ediciones Nueva Guia |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-5437-29-7 |url= |page=60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the building, there are four flanks painted in 1941 by [[José Clemente Orozco]], two of which are named ''The Social Labor Movement'' and ''Commonwealth''. There is also a mural done by American artist [[George Biddle]] entitled "War and Peace" at the entrance to the law library.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; The building also contains a mural by [[Rafael Cauduro]], which "graphically illustrates the Gran Guignol of Mexican torture",&lt;ref name=ross/&gt; and includes a depiction of the 1968 [[Tlatelolco massacre]] as well as "a cut-away of a prison, perhaps the infamous Lecumberri Black Palace where student leaders who escaped death were jailed."&lt;ref name=ross&gt;John Ross, ''[[CounterPunch]]'', 16 July 2010, [http://www.counterpunch.org/jross07162010.html In the Basement of Mexican Justice, No One is Innocent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719120301/http://www.counterpunch.org/jross07162010.html |date=19 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8059">The '''''Symphonia: sum fluxae pretium spei''''' is an [[orchestra]]l [[triptych]] by the American composer [[Elliott Carter]].  Its three [[Movement (music)|movements]] were composed between 1993 and 1995.  The complete work was first performed on April 25, 1998 at [[Bridgewater Hall]], [[Manchester]] by the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] under the conductor [[Oliver Knussen]].&lt;ref name="Score1"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Carter |first=Elliott |authorlink=Elliott Carter |year=1996 |title=Symphonia: sum fluxae pretium spei |publisher=[[Boosey &amp; Hawkes]] |url=http://www.boosey.com/cr/music/Elliott-Carter-Symphonia-sum-fluxae-pretium-spei/850 |accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second movement "Adagio tenebroso" was a finalist for the 1996 [[Pulitzer Prize for Music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Suzuki |first=Dean |title=View from the West: New Hope for the Pulitzer |work=[[NewMusicBox]] |date=August 1, 2003 |url=http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/view-from-the-west-new-hope-for-the-pulitzer/ |accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The ''Symphonia: sum fluxae pretium spei'' has a total duration of roughly 47 minutes, though its movements can be performed separately.  The title comes from the [[Latin]] poem "Bulla" by the English poet [[Richard Crashaw]] and translates into [[English language|English]] as "I am the prize of flowing hope."&lt;ref name="Score2"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Carter |first=Elliott |year=1993 |title=Symphonia: Partita |publisher=[[Boosey &amp; Hawkes]] |url=http://www.boosey.com/cr/music/Elliott-Carter-Symphonia-Partita/7364 |accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partita===
The first movement "Partita" was commissioned by the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]], which premiered the work under the conductor [[Daniel Barenboim]] at [[Symphony Center]], [[Chicago]] on February 17, 1994.  "Partita" has a duration of approximately 17 minutes.  The title refers to the modern [[Italian language]] word for "game" rather than the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] dance suite.&lt;ref name="Score2" /&gt;

===Adagio tenebroso===
The second movement "Adagio tenebroso" was commissioned by the [[BBC]] to celebrate the 100th anniversary of [[The Proms]].  It was composed in 1994 and was first performed at the [[Royal Albert Hall]], [[London]] on September 13, 1995, by the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] under the conductor [[Andrew Davis (conductor)|Andrew Davis]].  The piece is dedicated to the Proms and to Amira and [[Alexander Goehr]].  "Adagio tenebroso" has a duration of approximately 20 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Carter |first=Elliott |year=1994 |title=Symphonia: Adagio tenebroso |publisher=[[Boosey &amp; Hawkes]] |url=http://www.boosey.com/cr/music/Elliott-Carter-Symphonia-Adagio-tenebroso/2381 |accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegro scorrevole===
The third movement "Allegro scorrevole" was commissioned by the [[Cleveland Orchestra]].  It was composed over the summer of 1995 and was first performed at [[Severance Hall]], [[Cleveland]] on May 22, 1997, by the Cleveland Orchestra under the conductor [[Christoph von Dohnányi]].  The piece is dedicated to the orchestra and Oliver Knussen.  "Allegro scorrevole" has a duration of approximately 11 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Carter |first=Elliott |year=1996 |title=Symphonia: Allegro scorrevole |publisher=[[Boosey &amp; Hawkes]] |url=http://www.boosey.com/cr/music/Elliott-Carter-Allegro-scorrevole/6115 |accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation==
The ''Symphonia'' is scored for a large orchestra comprising three [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (2nd and 3rd doubling [[piccolo]]), two [[oboe]]s, [[cor anglais]], two [[clarinet]]s (2nd doubling [[E-flat clarinet]]), [[bass clarinet]], two [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], four [[French horn|horns]], three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], four percussionists, [[Pedal harp|harp]], [[piano]], and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="Score1" /&gt;

==Reception==
The composition has been praised by critics and musicians alike.  Reviewing the world premiere of "Partita," John von Rhein of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' highly praised the first movement, writing:{{quote|Partita [...] vividly conveys that sense of flying over an ever-changing landscape. Carter's web of sounds and silences continuously shifts as one kind of music breaks in upon another, moves to the fore and then is pushed aside by another. As with many of his recent works, you feel time itself is moving forward at many different rates. But so refined is his workmanship that, despite the density of musical information at any given moment, everything sounds, everything tells.

For most listeners it will require several hearings to be able to clear a path of understanding through this music, but Carter has made the effort rewarding. Partita attests to the extraordinary creative vitality of America's most famous living composer. In time, no doubt, his technical demands will be so second nature that the Chicago musicians will make more of the score's sportive qualities. But no one could fault their dedicated virtuosity, or the skill with which Barenboim put this musical [[Rubik's Cube|Rubik's cube]] together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rhein |first=John von |title=Carter's Partita Soars In The Night:Blackout Doesn't Dim Premiere |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=February 18, 1994 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-02-18/news/9402180251_1_elliott-carter-mr-carter-daniel-barenboim |accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The complete ''Symphonia'' has been similarly lauded by critics and has been regarded as one of Carter's best works.  The cellist [[Fred Sherry]] (who performed the first recording of Carter's [[Cello Concerto (Carter)|Cello Concerto]]) described the ''Symphonia: sum fluxae pretium spei'' as one of three Carter pieces he would "recommend to every music lover," including his [[Concerto for Orchestra (Carter)|Concerto for Orchestra]] and ''[[A Symphony of Three Orchestras]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Huizenga |first=Tom |title=Musicians Remember Elliott Carter |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=December 11, 2012 |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/deceptivecadence/2012/12/07/166761348/musicians-remember-elliott-carter |accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The music critic [[Paul Griffiths (writer)|Paul Griffiths]], who wrote the libretto for Carter's opera ''[[What Next? (opera)|What Next?]]'', declared the piece "a symphony beyond symphonies".&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web |last=Service |first=Tom |title=Symphony guide: Elliott Carter's Symphonia |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=9 April 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2014/apr/09/elliott-carter-symphonia-bubbles-colours-energy |accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tom Service of ''[[The Guardian]]'' included the ''Symphonia'' among his list of the fifty greatest symphonies, writing:{{quote|What makes Symphonia so special is that the piece is pitched in a place "beyond" the conventional confines of the symphony, because of the scale and scope of what it's attempting, poetically, musically and structurally. It's music that winds up reconfiguring what a symphony might be at the end of the 20th century, by which time the form had been battered, bruised and contorted out of all recognition to its heroic phase in the late 19th century; and which does so, paradoxically, because it defies, ignores, or flat-out contradicts the conventions of symphonic discourse. That's an astonishing achievement for any composer to attempt, let alone one in the middle of their ninth decade.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;}}

A '''technical director''' ('''TD''') is usually a senior technical person within e.g. a [[software]] company, [[engineering]] firm, [[film]] studio, [[Theatre|theatrical]] company or [[television studio]].  This person usually possesses the highest level of [[skill]] within a specific technical field.

== Software ==
In [[software development]], a technical director is typically responsible for the successful creation and delivery of the company's product to the marketplace by managing technical risks and opportunities; making key [[software design]] and implementation decisions with the development teams, scheduling of tasks including tracking dependencies, managing [[change request]]s, and guaranteeing quality of deliveries and educating the team on technical [[best practice]]s.

Typical responsibilities:
* Defines the technological strategy in conjunction with the development team of each project: pipeline, tools, and key development procedures
* Assesses technical risk and mitigation plan
* Establishes standards and procedures to track and measure project's progression
* Evaluates development teams, identifying strengths, problem areas, and developing plans for improving performance
* Evaluates interview candidates for technical positions
* Scouts for and evaluates new technology and tools as opportunities for innovation and development excellence
* Oversees technical design documentation process for correctness and timeliness
* Provides input to the other disciplines on the practicality of initial design goals and impact to the overall project timeline
* Evaluates software implementation on design and task thoroughness
* Helps to identify high risk areas for the project director
* Identifies weak software systems that need code improvement and schedules corrective action, when possible
* Creates automated test process for system features, where possible, and contributes to the build system
* Aids in all stages of post-production including during finalizing

== Film and games ==
In visual effects (VFX) ([[Industrial Light and Magic]], [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]]), feature animation ([[Pixar]], [[Dreamworks Animation]]) and game development ([[Naughty Dog]]), a technical director's responsibilities vary from studio to studio and as such, the term is not very well defined.

Typically, a TD is a combination of an artist and a programmer, responsible for the more technical aspects of film production, such as programming [[shader]]s, developing [[Skeletal animation|character rigs]] and animation setups, performing complex simulation tasks and setting up the pipeline (how the data is passed from one stage in the film production to the next). In contrast to a programmer, a TD would normally not work on large programming projects, but rather make heavy use of [[scripting language]]s such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Maya Embedded Language|MEL]], [[MAXScript]], or [[shell script]]ing.{{clarify|date=August 2013}} Another responsibility of a TD is to look after any technical problems the regular artists encounter and to develop custom tools to improve the artists' workflow.

In these industries, "technical artist", "technical animator" and "generalist TD" are sometimes used as synonyms.

===Categorization of technical directors in film and games===
Frequently, the role of a TD is more precisely defined. Various areas of computer graphics require a high degree of specialized technical/scientific knowledge and therefore merit more precise categorization. As an example, a skilled Character TD has a strong understanding of human/animal anatomy, movement, and mechanics, whereas a skilled Lighting TD might have a detailed understanding of the physical properties of light and surfaces.

Those categories include (but are not limited to) the following.
* Effects TD
* Lighting TD
* Modeling TD 
* Pipeline TD
* Layout TD
* [[Character TD|Creature TD or Character TD]]
* Hair TD 
* Cloth TD 
* Matchmove TD

=== Education ===
Technical directors usually have a background in computer science, though such education often lacks expertise in practical film and media production. [[Film Academy Baden-Württemberg|Filmakademie Baden-Württemberg]] offers a unique, 30-month postgraduate course for technical directing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://td.animationsinstitut.de Technical Directing]&lt;/ref&gt; The course is open to applicants worldwide (English language skills required). Aside from working on film, animation, vfx and game projects, the students also engage in research.

== Theatre ==
It is a technical director's job to make sure the technical equipment in the theater is functional, maintained and safe. The technical director, along with the production manager, is responsible for the overall organization of the technical production process. Duties included are generating necessary working drawings for construction (in conjunction with a draftsperson, if there is one); budget estimations and maintaining of accounts; materials research and purchasing; scheduling and supervising build crews; coordinating load-ins; handling conflicts that arise between different departments; and organizing the strike and clean-up for the production. Often times the Technical Director can serve as the head of the scenic department, supervising the master carpenter, carpenters, charge artists and leading them in the realiziation of the scenic designer's vision. 

"Technical director" can also refer to the in-house chief designer or master carpenter for a smaller theater company.

In venues that host touring productions, the TD may also be responsible for advancing the technical rider, hiring local crew, renting equipment and liaisoning between the tour manager and the local crew.

== Television ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cut (film)]] --&gt;
The technical director works in a [[production control room]] of a [[television studio]] and operates the [[Vision mixer|video switcher]] and associated devices as well as serving as the chief of the [[television crew]].  For a [[remote broadcast]] outside of the [[television studio|studio]], the TD will perform the same duties in a mobile [[production truck]]. It is the TD's job to ensure all positions are manned and all equipment and facilities are checked out and ready before the recording session or live broadcast begins. They typically will switch video sources, perform live digital effects and transitions, and insert pre-recorded material, graphics and titles as instructed by the [[Television director|director]]. In larger productions, the director does not actually operate the production equipment, allowing him/her to coordinate the production and make rapid decisions without worrying about how to mechanically execute the effect or camera move being called for. The technical director may provide training to more inexperienced members of the technical crew when needed. In consultation with the director, the TD may have more or less input into the creative side of the production, depending on the situation.  He/she may provide the director with guidance on crew assignments, camera shots and the most efficient way to accomplish any given effect. The TD is usually responsible for the technical quality of the signal being recorded or broadcast and will use various measuring devices and displays to ensure quality control.

Technical directors commonly work on productions that are either broadcast live or recorded on [[video tape]] or [[video server]]s. Television productions shot on film generally do not use TDs, as the camera cuts and effects are realized in [[post production]] after the shooting is completed.

The terminology in the [[UK]] differs in some respects from the above description: The production control room is called a "gallery", a mobile production truck is called an "[[Outside broadcasting|OB van]]" or a "scanner" (a [[BBC]] term).  In UK television practice, the technical director is the senior technical person in the gallery and supervises the technical team, but does not operate the "[[vision mixer]]".  The TD is responsible for ensuring that the gallery is technically fit for purpose, the routing of internal and external sources, as well as liaison with other technical areas such as [[master control]] rooms and transmission suites. They may additionally perform vision control duties, matching the exposure and colour balance of the cameras ("racking").

'''Teresa Elizabeth Furtado'''  (1845 – 9 August 1877) was a well-known actress at London's  [[Adelphi Theatre]] where she played leading [[melodrama]]tic roles for nine seasons.

She was the daughter of Charles Furtado, professor of music in London and composer of ballads. Her appearances at the Adelphi included ''No Thoroughfare'' by [[Wilkie Collins]] and [[Charles Dickens]] (1868) and Esmeralda in ''Notre-Dame or, The Gipsy Girl of Paris'', a dramatized version of [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1875). She also appeared in the premieres of two early works by [[W.S. Gilbert]] – as Pocahontas in his 1867 [[burlesque]], ''Robinson Crusoe'' at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] and as Jenny Wren in his 1867 [[pantomime]], ''[[Harlequin Cock Robin and Jenny Wren]]'' at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Stedman (1996) p. 40 and p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873 she married the English actor, John Clarke. Her premature death at the age of 32 led to his breakdown and he died less than two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen (1888) p. 435&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Fall of the Rebel Angels'''''  is an oil-on-panel by [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|the Netherlandish Renaissance]] artist [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], painted in 1562. It is currently held and exhibited at the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] in [[Brussels]].

==Description==
Painted in 1562, Bruegel's depiction of this subject is taken from a passage from the [[Book of Revelation]] (12, 2-9)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+12&amp;version=KJV King James Version, 12, 2-9]&lt;/ref&gt; and reveals the artist's profound debt to [[Hieronymous Bosch]], especially in the grotesque figures of the fallen angels, shown as half-human, half-animal monsters. Together with ''[[Dull Gret|Dulle Griet]]'' and ''[[The Triumph of Death]]'', which have similar dimensions, it was probably painted for the same collector and destined to become part of a series.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Pietro Allegretti. ''Brueghel''. Milan:Skira, 2003. {{ISBN|0-00-001088-X}} {{it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition with a central figure placed among many smaller figures was favoured by Bruegel at this time, not only in other paintings such as ''Dulle Griet'', but also in the series of engravings of the Vices and the Virtues which he had just completed for the [[Antwerp]] publisher [[Hieronymous Cock]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare Bruegel's engravings ''[[:Commons:File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Superbia (Pride) - WGA3539.jpg|Pride]]'' and ''[[:Commons:File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Gula (Gluttony) - WGA3541.jpg|Gluttony]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[archangel]] [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and his angels are shown by Bruegel in the act of driving the rebel angels from Heaven. [[Pride]] was the sin which caused the fall of [[Lucifer]] and his companions, and the conflict of good and evil, vice and virtue, is a theme which recurs constantly in Bruegel's work.&lt;ref&gt;Max Seidel, Roger H. Marijnissen. ''Bruegel''. Pt.2, Random House, 1985.

'''''The Gulf Stream''''' is an 1899 oil painting by [[Winslow Homer]]. It shows a man in a small dismasted rudderless fishing boat struggling against the waves of the sea, and was the artist's last statement on a theme that had interested him for more than a decade.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/11122|title=Winslow Homer - The Gulf Stream - The Met|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homer vacationed often in Florida, Cuba, and the Caribbean.

==Background==
Homer crossed the [[Gulf Stream]] numerous times; his first trip to the Caribbean in 1885 seems to have inspired several related works dated from the same year, including a pencil drawing of a dismasted boat, a large watercolor ''The Derelict (Sharks)'', and a larger watercolor of the forward part of the boat, ''Study for "The Gulfstream"''.&lt;ref name="C"&gt;Cikovsky, 382&lt;/ref&gt; A later watercolor study was ''The Gulfstream'' of 1889, in which the disabled boat now includes a sailor and flailing shark. Additionally, there are other related watercolors; the shark in ''Shark Fishing'' of 1885 was later appropriated for ''The Gulfstream'' of 1889,&lt;ref name="CO1"&gt;Cooper, 143&lt;/ref&gt; and a watercolor of 1899 entitled ''After the Hurricane'', in which a figure lies unconscious beside his beached boat, represents the finale of the watercolor narrative of man against nature.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 215-216&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Winslow Homer - After the Hurricane, Bahamas.jpg|thumb|left|''After the Hurricane'', painted by Homer in 1899, depicts a man washed up on a beach after a storm.]]

Another possible inspiration for the series of watercolors and ''The Gulf Stream'' itself was ''McCabe's Curse'', a Bahamian tale about a British Captain McCabe who in 1814 was robbed by thieves, hired a small boat in hopes of reaching a nearby island, but was caught in a storm and later died in Nassau of yellow fever; Homer saved an account of the story and pasted it into a travel guide.&lt;ref name="CO1"/&gt;

A visit to Nassau and Florida between December 1898 and February 1899 immediately preceded the final painting.&lt;ref name="C3"&gt;Cikovsky, 369&lt;/ref&gt; Homer began work on the painting by September 1899, at which time he wrote: "I painted in water colors three months last winter at Nassau, &amp; have now just commenced arranging a picture from some of the studies."&lt;ref&gt;Spassky, 35-37&lt;/ref&gt; Chronologically the first of a series of major works painted by Homer in the last decade of his life, ''The Gulf Stream'' was painted in the penultimate year of the century, the year after the death of his father, and has been seen as revealing his sense of abandonment or vulnerability.&lt;ref name="C3"/&gt;

==Exhibition and reaction==
In 1900 Homer sent ''The Gulf Stream'' to Philadelphia to be exhibited at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]], and after it was returned later that year he wrote "I have painted on the picture since it was in Philadelphia and improved it very much (more of the Deep Sea water than before)."&lt;ref name="S"&gt;Spassky, 37&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, comparison with an early photograph of the painting shows that Homer not only reworked the ocean, but changed the starboard gunwale by breaking it, added the sail and the red dash of color near the waterline, made the boat's name (''Anna – Key West'') clearly legible, and painted in the ship at the upper left horizon&lt;ref name="S"/&gt;—possibly to mitigate the sense of desolation in the work.&lt;!--read this somewhere, can't find ref right now--&gt; He then showed the painting at the [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Institute]] in Pittsburgh, and asked $4,000 for it.&lt;ref name="S"/&gt;

In 1906 ''The Gulf Stream'' was exhibited at the [[National Academy of Design]], and all the members of the academy's jury petitioned the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] to purchase the painting.&lt;ref name="S2"&gt;Spassky, 39&lt;/ref&gt; Newspaper reviews of the work were mixed;&lt;ref name="S2"/&gt; it was seen as more melodramatic than Homer's usual work. A reviewer in Philadelphia noted that viewers had laughed at the painting, which he referred to as "Smiling Sharks", describing the scene as "a naked negro lying in a boat while a school of sharks [are] waltzing around him in the most ludicrous manner". Another contemporary critic wrote that ''The Gulf Stream'' "displays a certain diffusion of interest seldom seen in the canvases of [Homer's] best manner".&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Randall C. ''Homer, Eakins &amp; Anshutz: the search for American identity in the gilded age'', p. 103. Penn State Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-271-02329-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum bought the painting the same year.

==Interpretation and influences==
[[File:Watsonandtheshark-original.jpg|thumb|[[John Singleton Copley]], ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'', 1778]]

Homer's intentions for ''The Gulf Stream'' are opaque. The painting has been described as "a particularly enigmatic and tantalizing episode, a marine puzzle that floats forever in a region of unsolved mysteries."&lt;ref name="G"&gt;Gardner, 211&lt;/ref&gt; Bryson Burroughs, a onetime curator at the Metropolitan Museum, noted that it "assumes the proportion of a great allegory if one chooses".&lt;ref name="S3"&gt;Spassky, 41&lt;/ref&gt; Its drama is of a romantic and heroic vein, the man stoically resigned to fate, surrounded by anecdotal detail reminiscent of Homer's early illustrative works.&lt;ref name="S"/&gt;

When a viewer requested an explanation for the narrative, Homer fairly bristled in response:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I regret very much that I have painted a picture that requires any description....I have crossed the Gulf Stream ''ten times'' &amp; I should know something about it. The boat &amp; sharks are outside matters of very little consequence. ''They have been blown out to sea by a hurricane.'' You can tell these ladies that the unfortunate negro who now is so dazed &amp; parboiled, will be rescued &amp; returned to his friends and home, &amp; ever after live happily.&lt;ref&gt;Spassky, 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mCSZzevvwpwC&amp;pg=PA307&amp;lpg=PA307&amp;dq=unfortunate%20negro%20who%20now%20is%20so%20dazed%20&amp;%20parboiled,%20will%20be%20rescued%20&amp;%20returned%20to%20his%20friends%20and%20home,%20&amp;%20ever%20after%20live%20happily.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Q-EHtw7B1e&amp;sig=UySqpDni-sMapAF6mLxB3eDyuPc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gQF5TIPSAYL-8AaD_MXuBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=unfortunate%20negro%20who%20now%20is%20so%20dazed%20&amp;%20parboiled,%20will%20be%20rescued%20&amp;%20returned%20to%20his%20friends%20and%20home,%20&amp;%20ever%20after%20live%20happily.&amp;f=false|title=Winslow Homer|first1=Nicolai|last1=Cikovsky|first2=Franklin|last2=Kelly|first3=Winslow|last3=Homer|first4=National Gallery of Art|last4=(U.S.)|first5=Museum of Fine Arts|last5=Boston|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Yale University Press|via=Google Books|page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The painting alludes to [[John Singleton Copley]]'s 1778 composition, ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'', as well as a handful of dramatic marine paintings of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="C3"/&gt; In ''American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America'', [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] contrasts Homer's picture with Copley's. While Copley's shark jaw is alien in form and most likely drawn from second-hand accounts, Homer's— owing to the artist's familiarity with the subject— correctly captures the shark's anatomy. Secondly, in Copley's version, a rescue is imminent: the horizon is near and light in tone, and many boats, within the harbor and probably docked, are seen in the background. Homer's version, with its circling sharks, broken mast, lone figure, looming water spout, and open sea give a sense of abandonment. The ship at far left is so distant as to suggest that society, while present, is completely unattainable; it presents the viewer with a so-close-yet-so-far situation. These two paintings contrast in their immediacy as well.  In ''Watson and the Shark'' there is constant movement:  the boat moving forward, the downward thrust of the spear, the two men reaching down for the victim, and finally the shark which extends off the canvas.  In Homer's painting, the scene is more static:  the sharks seem to swim slowly around the boat which lolls in a trough between waves.

[[File:Delacroix barque of dante 1822 louvre 189cmx246cm 950px.jpg|thumb|left|The looming sharks of ''The Gulf Stream'' have been compared to the damned souls that besiege ''[[The Barque of Dante]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]].&lt;ref name="C5"&gt;Cikovsky, 370&lt;/ref&gt;]]

References to other 19th-century paintings, including ''[[The Barque of Dante]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]], ''[[The Slave Ship]]'' by [[J. M. W. Turner]], and ''[[The Voyage of Life]]'' by [[Thomas Cole]] have been noted as well.&lt;ref name="C3"/&gt; These three paintings (in the case of the Delacroix, a preliminary study) were in one of the finest public art collections in America in the mid 19th century, that of [[John Taylor Johnston]] of New York, and it is likely that Homer was familiar with the paintings; one of his own works, ''[[Prisoners from the Front]]'', was in the same collection.&lt;ref name="C4"&gt;Cikovsky, 369-370&lt;/ref&gt; For art historian Nicolai Cikovsky, Jr., ''The Gulf Stream'' is more richly informed by these artistic predecessors than by Homer's direct experiences at sea, with the circling sharks derived from the tortured souls of ''The Barque of Dante'', the dramatic sea and sky inspired by ''The Slave Ship'', and the "mode of pictorial utterance" akin to ''The Voyage of Life''.&lt;ref name="C5"/&gt;

Elements in the painting have been interpreted as possessing funereal references: in addition to the black cross in the boat's bow, the open hatch (representing a tomb), ropes (for lowering the body), broken mast and torn sail (shroud) have been cited for symbolic meanings.&lt;ref name="C2"&gt;Cikovsky, 383&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the boat in Homer's painting ''[[Breezing Up (A Fair Wind)]]'' of 1876 featured an anchor in its bow, symbolic of hope.&lt;ref name="C2"/&gt;
The sailor in ''The Gulf Stream'' ignores these allusions, as he pays no heed to the sharks, waterspout, nor the ship in the distance, and inverts the optimism of the romantic masterpiece ''[[Raft of the Medusa]]'' painted earlier in the century by [[Théodore Géricault]].&lt;ref name="C2"/&gt;

Homer biographer Albert Ten Eyck Gardner believed ''The Gulf Stream'' was the artist's greatest painting, and art critic [[Sadakichi Hartmann]] called it "one of the greatest pictures ever painted in America".&lt;ref name="G"/&gt; Later assessments have been more critical of the "almost excessive pathos of the drama."&lt;ref name="S"/&gt; [[John Updike]] thought the painting "famous but on the edge of the absurd, with its overkill of sharks and waterspout".&lt;ref&gt;Updike, John. ''Still Looking: Essays on American Art'', p. 67. Alfred A. Knopf, New York: 1997. {{ISBN|1-4000-4418-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Sidney Kaplan, a scholar on black American culture, ''The Gulf Stream'' is the "masterpiece of the black image— the deathless Negro waiting stoically, Homerically for his end between waterspout and white-bellied shark."&lt;ref name="S3"/&gt;  Peter H. Wood has written a book interpreting the painting as an allegory of the situation of blacks in America during the slave trade and afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Peter H. ''Weathering the Storm: Inside Winslow Homer's Gulf Stream (Mercer University Lamar Memorial Lectures)'', University of Georgia Press (July 7, 2004). {{ISBN|0820326259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is referenced in [[Derek Walcott]]'s ''[[Omeros]]'', where the poem's narrator encounters the work on a visit to an unnamed museum and identifies the man in the painting with his character, Achille, referring to the painter as 'another Homer'.&lt;ref&gt;Walcott, Derek. ''Omeros'', XXXVI, ii.&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting is also referenced in the film [[Good Will Hunting]] when the protagonist, Will Hunting (played by [[Matt Damon]]), identifies a painting in his therapist's office as a "Winslow Homer rip-off, except you got whitey rowing the boat there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSfxl1KI6y8|title=Good Will Hunting (3/12) Movie CLIP - The Painting (1997) HD|first=|last=Movieclips|date=28 September 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Last Judgment''''' is a [[triptych]] by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], created after 1482.

The triptych currently resides at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna|Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. The outside of the shutters panel are painted in [[grisaille]] on panel, while the inside shutters and the center panel are painted in oil. The left and right panels measure 167.7 x 60&amp;nbsp;cm and the center panel measures 164 x 127&amp;nbsp;cm. It is not to be confused with either a fragmented piece of art by Bosch [[The Last Judgment (Bosch triptych fragment)|under the same title]] (now at [[Munich]]), or another [[The Last Judgment (Bosch triptych), Bruges|full painting by Bosch]], possibly by a painter in his workshop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.hu/art/b/bosch/7triptyc/8lastjud.jpg WGA.hu]&lt;/ref&gt;

The left panel shows the [[Garden of Eden]], at the top God is shown seated in Heaven while the [[Fallen angel|Rebel Angels]] are cast out of Heaven and transformed into insects. At the foot of the panel, God creates [[Eve]] from the rib of [[Adam]]. In the midground Eve is tempted by the Serpent, while the couple are finally seen being chased by the Angel into the dark forest, in the central panel where Jesus judges the souls while surrounded by the Saints. The right panel shows a hellscape, where the wicked are punished.

==Provenance==

The oldest mention of the painting is in a 1659 inventory of [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria]]'s collection, as by   "Hieronimo Bosz". In the late 18th century, the work was acquired by count  Lambert-Spritzenstein, from whom it later went to the current location. In the 17th-18th centuries, the triptych has been widely repainted and has lost part of the colors{{cn|date=September 2013}}.

Some art historians&lt;ref name="Varallo"&gt;{{cite book|first=Franca |last=Varallo|title=Bosch|publisher=Skira|location= Milan|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified this work as that acquired by [[Philip I of Castile]] in 1504, while others deny this. [[dendrochronology|Dendrochronologic]] analysis proved that the painting was executed not before 1482&lt;ref name="Varallo"/&gt; There is copy of the work, attributed to [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], in the  [[Gemäldegalerie]] of  [[Berlin]].

==Description==

The painting's composition has similarities with the ''[[Haywain Triptych]]'' or the ''[[Garden of Earthly Delights]]'': both also show the Garden of Eden in the left panel and the Hell at right. The central panel depicts a [[Last Judgement]], in a more obscure atmosphere than the Hell one.

===Shutters===
Like in other contemporary [[Flemish art|Flemish]] triptychs, the shutters are externally painted in [[grisaille]], depicting two saints. At left is [[St. James, son of Zebedee|St. James]] in pilgrimage within a wicked land with a hung man (perhaps a reference to some episode in the [[Golden Legend]]) ; at right is instead [[St. Bavo]], the patron of Flanders, donating to the poor with his hawk on his left wrist.

One of the characters in the latter panel, the old woman with a child, appears in a drawing attributed to Bosch, now in a [[San Francisco]] private collection.&lt;ref name="Varallo"/&gt;

[[File:Bosch Last Judgement Detail.jpg|thumb|240px|Detail of the left panel.]]

===Left panel===
The left panel depicts the [[Garden of Eden]] of the biblical history, as a green landscape in the lower three-quarters. In the upper section Bosch portrayed God sitting on his throne, surrounded by a luminous halo.&lt;ref name="Varallo"/&gt; Around him is a cloudy sky, with angels fighting rebellious angels who are turning into devils as they fall.

Below are, reading from the bottom, God creating Eve from Adam's rib, with Adam sleeping at her feet; the Serpent tempting Eve and the [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]]; and, finally, Adam and Eve expelled from the Garden by an angel, who holds a sword, into a dark forest.&lt;ref name="Varallo"/&gt;

===Central panel===
The central painting depicts a [[Last Judgement]], basing on John's [[Book of Revelation]]. Above is Christ as a judge, surrounded by the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], [[John the Evangelist]] and the apostles. The celestial zone, painted in a bright blue, contrasts with the rest of the panel, which is occupied by a dark brownish punishment of the Damned, while the Blessed occupy only a small portion. 
[[File:Hieronymus Bosch, The Last Judgment.JPG|240px|thumb|The central ''Last Judgement''.]]
The punishments come from monstrous creatures of Hell: the damned are burned, speared, impaled, hung from butcher hooks, forced to eat impure food (the Gluttonous), or subjects to cogs of bizarre machines. This scene has strong similarities with the right panel in Bosch's ''Garden'' at the [[Museo del Prado]].

===Right panel===
Thematically, the hell at right is not different from the Last Judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Eileen |last=Romano|title=Bosco|publisher=Unidad Editorial|year=2005|isbn=84-89780-69-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Satan]], in the center, receives the damned souls. The torture scenes continue in this panel, within a dark landscape dominated by flames and devilish figures.

'''''The Shadow''''' ({{lang-da|Skyggen}}) is a [[fairy tale]] by Danish poet and author [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. The tale was first published in 1847.

== Plot summary ==

Once a learned man from the northern regions of Europe went on a voyage south. One night, he sat on his terrace, while the fire behind him cast his shadow on the opposite balcony. As he was sitting there, resting, the man was amused to observe how the [[shadow]] followed his every movement, as if he really did sit upon the opposing balcony. When he finally grew tired and went to sleep, he imagined the shadow would likewise retire in the house across the street.
The next morning however, the man found to his surprise that he in fact had lost his shadow overnight. As a new shadow slowly grew back from the tip of his toes, the man did not give the incident another thought, returned to northern Europe, and took up writing again. Several years passed by until one night there was a knock at his door. To his surprise, it was his shadow, the one he lost years before in Africa, and now stood upon his doorstep, almost completely human in appearance. Astonished by his sudden reappearance, the learned man invited him into his house, and soon the two sat by the [[fireplace]], as the shadow related how he had come to be a man.

The learned man was calm and gentle by nature. His main object of interest lay with the good, the beautiful and the true, a subject of which he wrote often but was of no interest to anyone else. The shadow said his master did not understand the world, that he had seen it as truly was, and how [[evil]] some men really were.

The shadow then grew richer and fatter over the years, while the writer grew poorer and paler. Finally he had become so ill that his former shadow proposed a trip to a health resort offering to foot the bill as well, but on condition that he could act as the master now, and the writer would pretend to be his shadow. As absurd as this suggestion sounded, the learned man eventually agreed and together they took the trip, the shadow now as his master. At the resort, the shadow met with a beautiful princess, and as they danced and talked with each other each night, the princess fell in love with him.

When they were about to be married, the shadow offered his former master a luxurious position at the palace, on condition that he now became his own shadow permanently. The writer immediately refused and threatened to tell the princess everything, but the shadow had him arrested. Feigning distress, the shadow met with the princess and told her:
{|
|
:"I have gone through the most terrible affair that could possibly happen; only imagine, my shadow has gone mad; I suppose such a poor, shallow brain, could not bear much; he fancies that he has become a real man, and that I am his shadow."
:"How very terrible,” cried the princess; "is he locked up?"
:"Oh yes, certainly; for I fear he will never recover."
:"Poor shadow!" said the princess; "it is very unfortunate for him; it would really be a good deed to free him from his frail existence; and, indeed, when I think how often people take the part of the lower class against the higher, in these days, it would be policy to put him out of the way quietly."
|
:''"Jeg har oplevet det Grueligste, der kan opleves!" sagde Skyggen, "tænk Dig – ja, saadan en stakkels Skyggehjerne kan ikke holde meget ud! – Tænk Dig, min Skygge er blevet gal, han troer at han er Mennesket og at jeg – tænk dig bare, – at jeg er hans Skygge!"''
:''"Det er frygteligt!" sagde Prinsessen, "han er dog spærret inde?"''
:''"Det er han! Jeg er bange han kommer sig aldrig."''
:''"Stakkels Skygge!" sagde Prinsessen, "han er meget ulykkelig; det er en sand Velgjerning at frie ham fra den Smule Liv han har, og naar jeg rigtig tænker over det, saa troer jeg det bliver nødvendigt at det bliver gjort af med ham i al Stilhed!"''
|}
When the shadow wed the princess later that night, he learned that the man was already executed.

== Analysis ==
{{original research|section|date=August 2012}}{{review|section|date=August 2012}}
''The Shadow'' is an exemplary story in Andersen's darker fairy tales. Throughout the tale, the writer is portrayed as a moral person, concerned with the good and true in the world. But as it says, the people around him are not much interested in his feelings on the subject. Indeed, his shadow says he does not see the world as it truly is.

The shadow claims to have seen all that is in the world, but does not own a soul himself. He strongly desires to own a shadow of himself, and later asks his former master to reverse the roles on their trip. When the learned man finally realises how far his shadow has degraded, it is already too late.

The ending is especially bleak for a fairy tale, as Andersen suggests that it is not always good that triumphs, and that evil does indeed have a powerful grip over the good and just.

Some critics have suggested that Andersen wrote the story as a form of indirect revenge against Edvard Collin, his patron's son, who had rejected him.&lt;ref name=Victorian&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/genre/childlit/fairytales4.html Jacqueline Banerjee, The Impact of Hans Christian Andersen on Victorian Fiction], The Victorian Web, 12 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication ==

"The Shadow" was first published 6 April 1847 as a part of ''New Fairy Tales. Second Volume. First Collection. 1847.'' (''Nye Eventyr. Andet Bind. Første Samling. 1847.''). The work was re-published December 1847 as a part of ''A Christmas Greeting to my English Friends'', and again 18 December 1849 as a part of ''Fairy Tales. 1850.'' (''Eventyr. 1850.''). The tale was re-published 30 March 1863 as a part of ''Fairy Tales and Stories. Second Volume. 1863.'' (''Eventyr og Historier. Andet Bind. 1863.'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/register/info_e.html?vid=85 Hans Christian Andersen Center]: Hans Christian Andersen: The Shadow&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precedent ==
In 1814, three decades before the publication of "The Shadow", [[Adelbert von Chamisso]] had published "[[Peter Schlemihl|Peter Schlemihl's Miraculous Story]]", a story about a man who sells his shadow to the [[devil]] in exchange for a bottomless wallet. Andersen's story was prompted by Chamisso's, and he refers to it in "The Shadow":&lt;ref name=Victorian/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He was very annoyed, not so much because the shadow had disappeared, but because he knew there was a story; well-known to everybody at home in the cold countries, about a man without a shadow; and if he went back now and told them his own story, they would be sure to say that he was just an imitator, and that was the last thing he wanted.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Andersen's story in turn appears to have influenced [[Oscar Wilde]]'s "[[The Fisherman and His Soul]]".&lt;ref name=Victorian/&gt;

== Adaptations ==

''The Shadow'' became the first text of some considerable length to be published in [[Esperanto]]. It was contained in the 1888 ''[[Dua Libro]]'' (''Second Book'') by the creator of that language, [[L. L. Zamenhof]] (the first book had contained only single bible verses, short poems and the like).

[[Evgeny Shvarts]] has explicitly based his ''Tyen'' (''The Shadow'') play on Andersen's tale, introducing additional characters and plot lines and a different ending.

In 1945 the story was adapted as an episode of the syndicated radio program ''[[The Weird Circle]]''.

In 1994 [[Frederik Magle]], [[Thomas Eje]], [[Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen]] and others released the album ''The Song Is a Fairytale'' with songs based on Hans Christian Andersen's fairytales. "The Shadow" is one of the songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magle.dk/english/cd-info/fairytale.html|title=The Song is a Fairytale|publisher=magle.dk|accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Skuggaleikur'' (''Shadow Play'') is an opera by Icelandic composer Karólína Eiríksdóttir with libretto by [[Sjón]]. Premiered in November 2006.

In 2003, the [[Carolina Ballet]] premiered a ballet version of ''The Shadow'' with choreography by artistic director [[Robert Weiss (choreographer)|Robert Weiss]], set to the music of Khachaturian, Kabalevsky, Gyorgy Ligeti, Fauré and Rachmaninoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Lawrence | last=Van Gelder | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Arts Briefing | date=29 May 2003 | publisher= | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/29/arts/arts-briefing.html | work =The New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2009-06-20 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ballet features an eerie{{opinion|date=August 2012}} sequence in which the poet contemplates his shadow in the mirror. The image, which at first copies his movements in complete synchrony, seamlessly emerges from the mirror frame (through effective{{opinion|date=August 2012}} changes in lighting) as another dancer in a gray full body stocking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvnc.org/reviews/2003/may/CarolinaBalletFairyTales.html |title=Carolina Ballet: The Fairy Tales of Hans Christian Andersen |accessdate=2009-06-20 |last=Dobbs Ariail |first=Kate |date=May 2003 |work=Classical Voice of North Carolina }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Spear''''' is a painting by [[Cape Town]]-based South African artist, [[Brett Murray]].  It depicts South African President [[Jacob Zuma]] in a pose reminiscent of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], with his genitals exposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Govender|first=Peroshni|title=Presidential penis portrait riles S. Africa's ANC|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE84H07820120518|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting triggered a defamation lawsuit by Zuma's party, the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), and was vandalised on 22 May 2012.

== Exhibition ==
Prior to its being vandalised, ''The Spear'' was shown at the Goodman Gallery in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa.  The painting featured as one of the pieces of artist Brett Murray's ''Hail to the Thief II'' exhibition, which commenced on 10 May 2012.&lt;ref name=Goodman/&gt; Inspiration is understood to have been drawn from the [[Viktor Semyonovich Ivanov]]'s poster ''Lenin Lived, Lenin is Alive, Lenin Will Live''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The painting of President Zuma|url=http://inside-politics.org/2012/05/17/the-painting-of-president-zuma/|work=www.inside-politics.org|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition features various pieces that are critical of South Africa's ruling party, the ANC, showcasing sculptures and images that suggest [[corruption]] and bad governance.&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;{{cite web|title=Goodman Gallery - Hail to the Thief II|url=http://www.goodman-gallery.com/exhibitions/265|publisher=Goodman Gallery|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray's works in the exhibition also include modifying ANC liberation struggle posters and flyers from the [[Apartheid]] era, some displaying the text "Amandla, we demand Chivas, BMWs and bribes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iol.co.za/saturday-star/it-s-staying-up-1.1302261 |title=It’s staying up! |author=Sameer Naik and Kashiefa Ajam |date=22 May 2012 |work=The Saturday Star |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public perception of Jacob Zuma ==
Zuma has often been the centre of scandal and ridicule, due to his polygamous lifestyle with many wives and girlfriends,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jacob Zuma - "Polygamy is part of my culture"|url=http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/jacob-zuma-polygamy-part-my-culture|publisher=Radio Netherlands Worldwide|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a comment he made during his 2006 [[Jacob Zuma rape trial|rape trial]] that showering after sex would minimise the risk of contracting [[HIV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SA's Zuma 'showered to avoid HIV'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4879822.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His lifestyle has made him the target of well-known cartoonist [[Zapiro]], who frequently depicts Zuma with a shower on his head, ridiculing the statements he made during his trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nicolaides|first=Gia|title=Zapiro revives showerhead|url=http://news.iafrica.com/sa/574737.html|publisher=iafrica.com|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zapiro was also sued for defamation by the ANC, with a hearing expected in October 2012.&lt;ref name=BBC185 /&gt; These public perceptions of Zuma provided part of the basis for Brett Murray's painting.&lt;ref name=BBC185&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18115724 |title=Jacob Zuma painting: ANC to sue South Africa's Brett Murray |date=18 May 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapiro added fuel to the fire by doing his own version of the painting, replacing the genitals with a showerhead.&lt;ref name=Zapiro185&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zapiro.com/cartoon/890737-120520st |title=Published in Sunday Times on 20 May 2012 |date=20 May 2012 |publisher=Zapiro |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another appeared two days later, ridiculing Zuma.&lt;ref name=Zapiro186&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zapiro.com/cartoon/892612-120522tt |title=120522tt - President Zuma outraged at Brett Murray's Painting - Spear of the Nation |date=22 May 2012 |publisher=Zapiro |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ANC response ==

Owner and director of the Goodman Gallery, Liza Essers, said that she received a telephone call on Sunday, 13 May 2012 from special advisor to the minister of arts and culture Mduduzi Mbata seeking to clarify her thoughts on the exhibition, after it had been reviewed in the newspaper [[City Press (South Africa)|''City Press'']], along with a photograph of ''The Spear''. During the brief conversation she invited him to visit the gallery the following Tuesday, but he never kept the appointment.&lt;ref name=AiA&gt;{{cite web|last=Dubin|first=Steven|title=Liza Essers, Gallery Owner, on the Show that Scandalized South Africa|url=http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-opinion/conversations/2012-06-05/liza-essers-brent-murray-goodman-gallery/|work=Art in America|publisher=Art in America|accessdate=7 June 2012|date=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ANC issued a press release on 17 May 2012 expressing outrage about the painting and their intention to apply to the High Court to have it removed, this being reiterated by attorneys representing the ANC and Jacob Zuma in an email sent to Essers the same day.&lt;ref name=AiA/&gt; The painting drew strong condemnation from ANC rulers and various religious groups, who found the painting 'obscene' and 'vulgar'.&lt;ref name="mosomane1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mosomane|first=Phuti|title=Zuma painting against Ubuntu, African morality, culture|url=http://www.thenewage.co.za/Detail.aspx?news_id=51152&amp;cat_id=1007|publisher=The New Age|accessdate=19 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526184457/http://www.thenewage.co.za/Detail.aspx?news_id=51152&amp;cat_id=1007|archivedate=26 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A leader of the Nazareth Baptist Church called for the artist to be stoned to death.&lt;ref name=AiA/&gt; The ANC also demanded that the image be taken down from the [[City Press (South Africa)|''City Press'']]' website.  ANC spokesperson Jackson Mthembu said of the painting, "The African National Congress is extremely disturbed and outraged by the distasteful and indecent manner in which Brett Murray and the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg is displaying the person of comrade President Jacob Zuma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ANC to go to court over Zuma painting|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/ANC-to-go-to-court-over-Zuma-painting-20120517|publisher=News24.com|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zuma responded to the artwork by saying that it painted him as "a philanderer and a womaniser".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Painting makes me a womaniser - Zuma|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/painting-makes-me-a-womaniser-zuma-1.1300191|accessdate=20 May 2012|newspaper=IOL.co.za|date=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In response to the impending legal action, gallery spokesperson Lara Koseff said its lawyers had responded that it would stay until the show was over, citing censorship concerns as central to the decision to allow the exhibition to continue.&lt;ref name="mosomane1"/&gt;  The [[African National Congress Women's League|ANC Women's League]] has also demanded that the exhibition be halted, and all instances of the image be removed from the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Painting violates president's integrity, says ANCWL|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2012/05/19/painting-violates-president-s-integrity-says-ancwl|accessdate=19 May 2012|newspaper=Times Live|date=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stephen|first=Grootes|title=Zuma portrait saga goes to court|url=http://www.ewn.co.za/en/2012/05/19/Zuma%20portrait%20saga%20goes%20to%20court.aspx|accessdate=19 May 2012|newspaper=Eyewitness News|date=19 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602173211/http://ewn.co.za/en/2012/05/19/Zuma%20portrait%20saga%20goes%20to%20court.aspx|archivedate=2 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brett Murray said that his painting had not been intended maliciously, but as "an attempt at humorous satire of political power and patriarchy within the context of other artworks in the exhibition and within the broader context of South African discourse".&lt;ref name=N24Defaced /&gt;

In the first day of legal proceedings, the representative for the ANC, Gcina Malindi, began sobbing and was unable to proceed, causing the process to be adjorned and postponed and the television coverage of the event was suppressed.

=== Consequences ===
The ANC's public condemnation of the painting brought widespread local and international attention to the painting, where otherwise it may have remained a relatively obscure piece of work.  For this reason, the action and subsequent fall-out has been characterised as an example of the [[Streisand effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Just Hanging Out|url=http://6000.co.za/just-hanging-out/|publisher=6000 Miles from Civilization|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mahere|first=Fadzayi|title=Why Zuma's Spear should stay up|url=http://www.newzimbabwe.com/opinion-8058-Why+Zumas+Spear+should+stay+up/opinion.aspx|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=New Zimbabwe|date=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, ''The Spear'' has been featured in editorials and news features in all forms of traditional and digital media.

Former ANC leader [[Oliver Tambo]]’s daughter Tselane Tambo was of the opinion that Zuma deserved Murray’s portrayal of him. She wrote on a social networking site, “Do the poor enjoy poverty? Do the unemployed enjoy hopelessness? Do those who can’t get housing enjoy homelessness? He must get over it. No one is having a good time. He should inspire the reverence he craves. This portrait is what he inspired. Shame neh!”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Video: Zuma’s Spear painting sabotage|url=http://www.thesouthafrican.com/news/spear-today-gone-tomorrow.htm|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=The South African .com|date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The media boycott of ''City Press'' by the ANC and various public figures led to the newspaper eventually removing the painting from its website on 28 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=de Waal|first=Mandy|title=City Press buckles to ANC demands - and threats|url=http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-05-28-city-press-buckles-to-anc-demands-and-threats|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=Daily Maverick|date=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The paper's editor-in-chief Ferial Haffajee cited several reasons for this decision, including violent threats made to her team by those supporting the boycott.{{or|date=July 2012}}

=== Media boycott ===
After ''City Press'' repeatedly refused to remove an image of the painting off their website, the ANC called upon its members and sympathisers to boycott placing advertising in, and buying of, the weekly paper.  A statement released by the ANC said: "Their refusal to remove this portrait from their website and their controlled social media is a clear indication that this newspaper does not belong to our shared democratic dispensation and values."  Responding to the boycott, ''City Press'' editor-in-chief [[Ferial Haffajee]] described Nzimande's call for a boycott of the paper as "deeply disturbing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boycott 'immoral' ''City Press'', ANC urges|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/Boycott-City-Press-the-paragon-of-immorality-ANC-20120524-2|accessdate=25 May 2012|newspaper=News24.co.za|date=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ANC was criticised by the South African National Editors' Forum (SANEF),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=David|title=Zuma genitals row escalates as ANC calls for boycott of newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/25/zuma-genitals-row-anc-newspaper-boycott|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which said "While we recognise the right of the ANC to advise members on how to exercise their consumer decisions, the call for a boycott of a newspaper is tantamount to intimidation and abuse of power ...

== Defacement ==
On the morning of 22 May 2012, two men entered the gallery during visiting hours, and defaced the painting - first by painting a red cross over the depiction of Zuma's face and genitals, and then by smearing black paint over the canvas.  The two men — Barend la Grange and Lowie Mabokela&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2012/05/painting-south-african-presidents-penis-defaced/52698/ |title=Painting of South African President's Penis Defaced |author=Adam Martin |date=23 May 2012 |work=The Atlantic |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; — were arrested by security officials.

==Comparisons==
''The Spear'' portrait has invited comparison to other satirical pieces, including fellow South African artist [[Ayanda Mabulu|Ayanda Mabulu's]] work, ''{{lang|zu|Ngcono ihlwempu kunesibhanxo sesityebi}}'' (Zulu: "Better poor than a rich puppet"), which depicts various regional and international political figures - including Jacob Zuma - in the nude.  The painting received additional attention following the media focus on controversial satirical artworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Butana|first=Kwanele|title=Cape artist despairs for ‘illiterate’ ANC|url=http://www.iol.co.za/the-star/cape-artist-despairs-for-illiterate-anc-1.1302504|publisher=iol.co.za|accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Spirit of Life''''' is a sculpture by American sculptor [[Daniel Chester French]].

==Overview==
''The Spirit of Life'' began as a commission for a memorial to the famous Wall Street financier [[Spencer Trask]] (1844–1909). Trask was a summer resident in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]] and a founder of the committee which was charged with renewing the city's reputation as a health resort.  The commission for the monument came from [[George Foster Peabody]] who was a friend of Trask's. [[Henry Bacon]], who collaborated with French on the [[Lincoln Memorial]], designed the setting for French's statue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yeodoug.com/resources/dc_french/spirit_of_life/dcfrench_spirit_of_life.html Daniel Chester French: ''The Spirit of Life''&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Audrey Munson]] was the model for the statue.

The statue stands in the heart of [[Canfield Casino and Congress Park|Congress Park]] in Saratoga Springs, New York, on a shallow niche of white marble with a balustraded terrace above and an oblong lagoon, set in marble and surrounded with verdant shrubbery, green lawns, and a wealth of flowers below.  The statue is a figure of a winged woman, hands poised high above her head.  The figure represents [[Hygieia]], the giver of health, who usually appeared in Greek and Roman art accompanying her father, [[Asklepios]], the god of medicine. She is often shown offering nourishment to a serpent entwined on the staff Asklepios carries. In French's conception, Hygieia holds a shallow bowl aloft and in the other hand clasps a pine bough, a reference to the towering pines on the grounds of the Trasks' estate. The goddess is poised lightly on a rock, and a stream of water pours from its cleft.  The pedestal is a sculptured reproduction of the tufaceous deposits seen about the orifice of many of Saratoga's famous springs.&lt;ref&gt;Saratoga's Tribut to Spencer Trask; Unveiling of "The Spirit of Life," Completing the Memorial to Him, ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 27, 1915&lt;/ref&gt;  Inscription on the statue reads "To do good and serve my fellow man."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saratogafoodgroup.com/spirit.htm ''The Spirit of Life''&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Spirit of Life'' is one of French's finest "active" statues. The flow of the angel's robe and the position of her right foot gives a great deal of motion. Several smaller castings of the statue were made and authorized by French; six were made between 1923 and 1931.

It is considered a [[contributing property|contributing object]] to the [[National Historic Landmark District]] that includes the park and Canfield Casino.

[[File:Johan_Christian_Dahl_-_Stugunøset_at_Filefjell_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg|thumb|300px]]
'''''The Stugunøset in the Filefjeld''''' (Norwegian - ''Stugunøset på Filefjeld'', ''Stugunøset på Fillefjell'' or ''Stugunøset på Filefjell'') is an 1851 painting by [[JC Dahl]], now in the [[National Gallery of Norway]]. It shows the Støgonøse mountain in the [[Filefjell]] area in the [[Valdres]] district and was painted just after the artist's last trip to Valdres in 1850, aged 62. He based it on a sketch he had made on the high mountain ridge north of Utrøvatnet.

In 1852 it was sold to the [[Oslo Kunstforening|Christiania Art Society]], which sold it the following year to [[Wilhelm Adelsten Maribo]], who left it to its current owner in 1901.
