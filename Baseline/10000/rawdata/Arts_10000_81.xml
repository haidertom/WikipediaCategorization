'''130–136 Piccotts End''' is a medieval [[timber framed]] building in [[Piccotts End]] in [[Hertfordshire]], England. Originally a [[hall house]],&lt;ref name="pep"&gt;{{cite web|title=About 132 Piccotts End|url=https://www.piccottsendpaintings.uk/about-the-cottage/|website=Piccotts End Paintings|accessdate=14 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114105125/https://www.piccottsendpaintings.uk/about-the-cottage/|archivedate=14 November 2017|language=en|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the structure has been divided into a row of cottages. Two of the cottages are of interest for the art work they contain.&lt;ref name="NHLE"&gt;{{NHLE|num=1342208|desc=130–136 Piccotts End|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Important murals were discovered at No 132 in the 1950s and the entire building was [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed Grade I]].

==Location==
[[Piccotts End]] is a village near [[Hemel Hempstead]]. The original function of the building is not known. It has been suggested that the building was connected with [[Ashridge Priory]], which was in existence from the thirteenth to the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=mural&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dacorumheritage.org.uk/article/the-secret-religious-code-of-mystery-medieval-murals/|title=The secret religious code of mystery medieval murals|publisher=Dacorum Heritage Trust|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murals==
Inside the house at number 132 are a number of fifteenth-century religious [[Mural|wall painting]]s, which are of particular interest to historians as a rare example of pre-Reformation English Catholic art. The paintings are thought to originate from around 1470-1500. Following the [[English Reformation]], religious art came to be regarded as a form of [[idolatry]] and many works were obliterated or destroyed; for this reason, some of the faces in the Piccotts End murals were mutilated and the paintings subsequently covered over by whitewash. They remained hidden for over 400 years until they were uncovered in 1953 by a resident.&lt;ref name="pep" /&gt;

The origins of the paintings is unknown. Historians surmise that the Piccotts End house may have served as a [[hospice]] for pilgrims, as it was located close to a [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrim trail]] which went via the nearby [[Ashridge Priory|Monastery of the Bonhommes at Ashridge]]. At Ashridge, pilgrims could venerate a phial of the [[Blood of Christ]] before proceeding to [[St Albans Abbey]] to venerate the holy [[relic]]s of [[Saint Alban]]. The art historian [[E. Clive Rouse]] has noted that the murals exhibit a technique of [[woodcut]] illustration dating from the late 15th and early 16th centuries, suggesting the influence of the artistic style of the [[Habsburg Netherlands|Low Countries]].&lt;ref name="pep" /&gt;&lt;ref name=mural/&gt;

The wall paintings consist of five panels, arranged in a type of [[iconostasis]], resembling a large screen covered with icons, set in tiers. In the centre panel is [[Christ in Majesty]], with the [[Christogram#IHS|"IHS" Sacred Monogram]] in the [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]].  In the right panel is depicted the  [[Baptism of Jesus]] by [[Saint John the Baptist]]; in the background an [[archangel]] holds Christ’s robes. On the extreme right is a badly damaged image of [[Pope Clement I|Saint Clement]], the third Pope with a symbolic anchor on each shoulder and the [[Papal cross]]. The left panel contains a [[Pietà]] (the Virgin Mary holding the dead Christ), and on the far left is a representation of [[Saint Peter]] wearing the [[Papal Tiara]], with a Papal cross and the [[Keys of Heaven]]. In the two lower panels are paintings of figures of [[St Catherine of Alexandria]] (with her Catherine wheel)  and [[Margaret the Virgin|Saint Margaret of Antioch]] emerging from the belly of a dragon. Many figures are depicted wearing typical [[1400–1500 in European fashion|Tudor dress]]. They are decorated with orange-red, grey and blue and white foliation with yellow fruit and flowers. A blank space in the lower wall suggests the former presence of an altar.&lt;ref name="pep" /&gt;

It has been suggested that some of the symbolism contained in the wall paintings indicate connections with the doctrines of [[Catharism]], a sect considered [[Heresy in Christianity|heretical]] by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="pep"/&gt;

==Hospital==
In the 1820s the building was converted for use as a [[cottage hospital]] by the anatomist and surgeon Sir [[Astley Cooper]].&lt;ref name="Telegr"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/4811661/Inside-story-Piccotts-End.html |title=Inside story |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the early 1830s the number of patients increased because of injuries to workers constructing the [[London and Birmingham Railway|London to Birmingham railway]]. Accordingly the hospital moved to larger premises at [[Hemel Hempstead Hospital|Cheere House]] in [[Hemel Hempstead]] in 1832.&lt;ref name=archives&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/hospitalrecords/details.asp?id=412|title=Hemel Hempstead General Hospital (West Herts Wing), Hemel Hempstead|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BET Jams''' is an [[United States|American]] [[pay television]] [[television network|network]] controlled by [[BET Networks]] and owned by [[Viacom Media Networks]]. The channel features [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[urban contemporary]] [[music video]]s. The network, formerly known as '''MTV Jams''', was rebranded under the [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] banner on October 5, 2015.

==History==
===MTV Jams (2002–15)===
[[File:Mtv jams.svg|thumb|right|150px|The network's logo from the launch of MTV Jams in 2002 until April 13, 2012; often the logo took on different coloring. The logo was modified in February 2010 to remove the ''Music Television'' tag, though the publicity department of MTV Networks never released a version of that logo.]]
[[File:MTV Jams Logo.png|thumb|right|150px|Second logo as MTV Jams, used from April 13, 2012 until October 5, 2015]] 
The channel debuted in 2002, replacing [[MTVX]], a network that focused on [[hard rock music|hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] which debuted on August 1, 1998. The replacement of MTVX by MTV Jams was explained by the network as being based on demographic trends and industry data that there was a lower demand for a channel devoted to hard rock and heavy metal than there was for hip-hop, rap and R&amp;B; as a result, Viacom management made the decision to launch a new music video network over MTVX's channel space. The network's name was taken from a two-hour daily program block on [[MTV]], called ''MTV Jams'', which ran from 1992 to 2000 and was also the general branding for urban music broadcast on the flagship channel.

After its launch, MTV Jams' playlist became predictable and less random than it originally seemed. The new videos that were in heavy rotation were usually played once per hour or once per every two hours. MTV Jams was the last remaining MTV network in the United States to use MTV's original [[Kabel (typeface)|Kabel]] font for its music video credit tags, which the main MTV network discontinued in October 2007. MTV Jams switched to the font style used by MTV Hits and rarely by MTV itself in May 2011.

The network's logo had a minor readjustment in February 2010 to remove the ''Music Television'' tagline and a small quarter of the logo in line with the official rebranding of all MTV networks. The network had its first full-fledged change in imaging on April 13, 2012, in line with the March 26 re-imaging of [[NickMusic|MTV Hits]]. A new logo and imaging was introduced on that date, featuring all text in bold [[Helvetica]], including a minimal-style logo with the 2010 MTV logomark next to the word "Jams".

===BET Jams (2015–present)===
The network was rebranded as BET Jams on October 5, 2015, to better align with BET. The channel continues to play hip-hop and urban contemporary videos as MTV's mainline networks, including MTV itself and [[MTV2]], draw down their dependence on them. With the rebrand, [[MTV Live (TV network)|MTV Live]] (formerly Palladia) along with [[MTVU]] remain as the only MTV-branded 24/7 video formatted networks with a music focus. When MTV Jams was replaced with BET Jams, MTV Live started a MTV Jams block which airs late at night, with reruns airing during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hiphopsince1987.com/2015/news/bet-jams-replaced-mtv-jams/|title=BET Jams Replaced MTV Jams|last=Wyche|first=Brandon|date=5 October 2015|publisher=HipHopSince1987.com|accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programming ==
The channel runs on an [[automation|automated]] eight-hour wheel schedule that repeats three times a day which starts at 6 a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]], with resets at 2 and 10 p.m. ET. Traditional direct response and promotional advertising and other interstitial programming is also carried on the network, along with various theme programming to promote album releases or other happenings in the music world. Beginning in the summer of 2004, MTV Jams added some variety to its programming. Along with [[NickMusic|MTV Hits]], MTV Jams began to play more obscure videos, as well as a larger selection of older videos, than it had previously played. The automated wheel remained with the changeover to BET, though segments connected to MTV or MTV.com are expected to be discontinued.

Currently, the breadth of BET Jams' playlist surpasses that of [[BET Soul]], with several hundred more videos played on a regular basis. Most of the urban music videos that have ever aired on BET, MTV and [[VH1]] are seen on MTV Jams, as well as many more obscure urban videos that cannot be seen on any other Viacom-owned network, though usually the channel does not air music preceding the 1989 premiere of ''[[Yo! MTV Raps]]'', except for a few small cases. The relaunch as BET Jams was tied to the [[2015 BET Hip Hop Awards]] held nine days later, along with promotion for nominated artists and songs.

The network has a weekly "Jam of the Week" which is announced on Sundays, with the video chosen receiving extended plays throughout the week.

===Former programming===
MTV Jams aired a frequent live game show, ''Hood Fab'', hosted by Buttahman; in which two contestants (normally one popular [[hip-hop]] artist and one random contestant off of the street, although there have been games where two artists went against each other) are asked questions about hip-hop. The contests take place in various cities. The one who answers the most questions correctly gets a bonus question, to which a prize is awarded to that contestant. The artist normally just receives bragging rights and the "Official Hood Fab [[socks|tube socks]]" while the random contestant will receive a prize of higher value as well as the tube socks.

The channel also periodically aired a short-form program called ''The Parker Report'', hosted by Erik Parker; in each episode, Parker featured hip-hop artists, normally under a theme (for instance, one episode featured the [[Grand Hustle]] team of [[T.I.]], [[Alfamega]], and [[Big Kuntry King]]) to talk about issues in hip-hop. In the aforementioned episode, the four discussed the [[autotune]] "[[T-Pain]]" effect and about how he rediscovered it. The panel came to a conclusion about the issue discussed; for instance, the guests and host came to the conclusion to, when using the autotune, either "shout out" to T-Pain or feature him on the record. 

The network also aired the [[Ozone Awards]] for several years under a [[brokered programming]] arrangement.

=== Marathons ===
Occasionally, the network has aired air special, unannounced alphabetical marathons of music videos by artist name, usually around holiday periods, or videos themed around lists such as most popular of the year, nominated for certain awards or that of an artist around the release of a new album.

=== Themed blocks ===
From time to time, the network is also known to include special themed blocks of programming, for example, an hour of a specific artist or label's videos, an hour block of 1990s gangsta rap, or a string of [[reggae]]-style videos. These are always unannounced and spontaneous for viewers, in the vein of [[MTV2]]'s original format.

In the fall of 2004, MTV Jams presented a week of shows titled "Takeover", where artists were invited to host a day of programming. Artists included [[Usher Raymond|Usher]], [[Kanye West]], [[Lil Jon]], [[Nelly]], and [[Fat Joe]] (a format eventually picked up by competitor [[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]] as the network drastically reduced their original programming due to budget issues). Each artist played their favorite videos and their own videos. Additionally, MTV specials such as ''Diary'' and live performance footage was played that related to the artists. This may have marked the first time the channel has ever aired any non-music video programming. In March 2005, MTV Jams invited [[50 Cent]] to its studios to introduce his and his posse's music videos, as well as to play some of his favorite old school videos. He also spoke briefly between videos about his newest album and about his musical inspirations. At the time, these two specials were the closest to a [[VJ (media personality)|VJ]]-presented program to ever appear on the channel.

=== ''Fab 5 of Summer '05'' ===
During the summer of 2005, MTV Jams debuted a new, larger logo in order to promote special programming called "The Fab 5 of Summer '05" that was running on the channel for the duration of that season. The "Fab 5" were five up-and-coming hip-hop artists that the channel placed a heavy emphasis on during the entire summer; these artists were [[Juelz Santana]], [[Da Back Wudz]], [[Young Jeezy]], [[Tony Yayo]], and [[Paul Wall]]. Da Back Wudz, Young Jeezy, Tony Yayo, and Paul Wall came into the MTV Jams studio to speak about their careers and to play blocks of their favorite videos. These blocks were rotated pretty heavily, sometimes several times a day, as such the summer of 2005 had arguably became the period of MTV Jams' history that has seen the most redundant and least varied playlist to date.

That same summer, MTV Jams moved one step closer toward its high-budget, show-based sister networks MTV and VH1 when it briefly aired documentary style programs on the hip-hop themed and MTV-produced movie ''[[Hustle and Flow]]''.

== Availability ==
BET Jams is available on the high-tier packages of most pay television providers, but was not available on [[Dish Network]] until 2016 (it remains unavailable on [[DirecTV]]). This is an artifact of the network's former editorial and operational control under [[Viacom Media Networks|MTV/Viacom Media Networks]], where the channel was part of the [[digital cable]]-exclusive MTV/Nickelodeon Digital Suite.

[[Time Warner Cable]] previously did not carry the network except on systems it owned that were formerly operated by the now-defunct [[Adelphia Communications]], systems where previous contracts with MTV Networks are required to be honored, and [[Bright House Networks]], of which Time Warner Cable formerly had a stake in. This resulted in the network being unavailable in [[New York City]] outside of areas serviced by [[Cablevision]]; TWC is the major cable provider for [[Manhattan]], [[Staten Island]], [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]]. MTV Jams and its sister networks were added in the summer of 2012 as part of a wider agreement between Viacom and Time Warner Cable to allow access to its networks over TWC's tablet applications, along with its mobile apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118054142|title=Viacom, Time Warner Cable settle app flap; Viacom channels to be available on iPad viewing service|last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|date=16 May 2012|work=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network is also carried on some pay-television providers in [[Latin America]].

'''Benjamin Jonson''' (''c''. 11 June 1572 – ''c''. 16 August 1637&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bland|first=Mark|date=2004|title=Ben Jonson and the Legacies of the Past|jstor=10.1525/hlq.2004.67.3.371|journal=Huntington Library Quarterly|volume=67|pages=371–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an English playwright, poet, actor, and literary critic, whose artistry exerted a lasting impact upon English poetry and stage comedy. He popularised the [[comedy of humours]]. He is best known for the [[satire|satirical]] plays ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]''&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Jonson, Ben |volume=15 |pages=502–507 |first=Adolphus William |last=Ward}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1598), ''[[Volpone|Volpone, or The Fox]]'' (c. 1606), ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' (1610) and ''[[Bartholomew Fair (play)|Bartholomew Fair]]'' (1614) and for his [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] and [[epigram]]matic poetry; he is generally regarded as the second most important English playwright during the reign of [[James VI and I]] after [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|306058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonson was a [[Classics|classically educated]], well-read and cultured man of the [[English Renaissance]] with an appetite for controversy (personal and political, artistic and intellectual) whose cultural influence was of unparalleled breadth upon the playwrights and the poets of the [[Jacobean era]] (1603–1625) and of the [[Caroline era]] (1625–1642).&lt;ref name="autogenerated388"&gt;"Ben Jonson", ''Grolier Encyclopedia of Knowledge'', volume 10, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StewartHarp2000"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Evans |first=Robert C |year=2000 |editor=Harp, Richard |editor2=Stewart, Stanley |title=The Cambridge companion to Ben Jonson |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |isbn=0-521-64678-2 |pages=189–202 |chapter=Jonson's critical heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:William Camden by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Westminster School]] master [[William Camden]] cultivated the artistic genius of Ben Jonson.]]

[[File:Attributed to Abraham van Blijenberch - William Drummond of Hawthornden, 1585 - 1649. Poet - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Scottish poet [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]] was friend and confidant to Jonson.]]
In midlife, Jonson claimed that his paternal grandfather, who 'served King Henry 8 and was a gentleman',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-15116&lt;/ref&gt; was a member of the extended Johnston family of [[Annandale]] in the [[Dumfries and Galloway|Dumfries and Galloway]], a genealogy that is attested by the three spindles ([[rhombus|rhombi]]) in the Jonson family [[coat of arms]]: one spindle is a diamond-shaped [[Heraldry|heraldic]] device used by the Johnston family. 

Jonson's father lost his property, was imprisoned, and suffered [[forfeiture (law)|forfeiture]] under [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]]; having become a clergyman upon his release, he died a month before his son's birth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-15116&lt;/ref&gt; Jonson's mother married a master [[bricklayer]] two years later.&lt;ref name="Robert Chambers, Book of Days"&gt;Robert Chambers, Book of Days&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Ben Jonson", Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th Edition, pp. 611&lt;/ref&gt; Jonson attended school in [[St Martin's Lane]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Later, a family friend paid for his studies at [[Westminster School]], where the [[antiquarian]], historian, [[topographer]] and [[officer of arms]], [[William Camden]] (1551–1623) was one of his masters. In the event, the pupil and the master became friends, and the intellectual influence of Camden's broad-ranging scholarship upon Jonson's art and [[style (fiction)|literary style]] remained notable, until Camden's death in 1623.

On leaving Westminster School, Jonson was to have attended the [[University of Cambridge]], to continue his book learning but did not, because of his unwilled apprenticeship to his bricklayer stepfather.&lt;ref name="autogenerated388"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert Chambers, Book of Days"/&gt; According to the churchman and historian [[Thomas Fuller]] (1608–61), Jonson at this time built a garden wall in [[Lincoln's Inn]]. After having been an apprentice bricklayer, Ben Jonson went to the [[Netherlands]] and volunteered to soldier with the English regiments of [[Francis Vere]] (1560–1609) in [[Flanders]].

The ''Hawthornden Manuscripts'' (1619), of the conversations between Ben Jonson and the poet [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; (1585–1649), report that, when in Flanders, Jonson engaged, fought and killed an enemy soldier in [[single combat]], and took for trophies the weapons of the vanquished soldier.&lt;ref name=Hawthornden&gt;{{Cite book |last=Drummond |first=William |year=1619 |title=Heads of a Conversation betwixt the Famous Poet Ben Johnson and William Drummond of Hawthornden, January 1619 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubHPBcMk2OMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22William+Drummond%22+jonson&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=S0PASPT7GY-2iwGjjPTsDQ&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA43,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his military activity on the Continent, Jonson returned to England and worked as an actor and as a playwright. As an actor, Jonson was the protagonist “Hieronimo” (Geronimo) in the play ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' (ca. 1586), by [[Thomas Kyd]] (1558–94), the first [[revenge tragedy]] in English literature. Moreover, by 1597, he was a working playwright employed by [[Philip Henslowe]], the leading producer for the English public theatre; by the next year, the production of ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' (1598) had established Jonson's reputation as a dramatist.&lt;ref&gt;"Ben Jonson", Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th Edition, p. 611&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Thomas Kyd", ''Grolier Encyclopedia of Knowledge'', volume 11, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding his marriage Jonson described his wife to William Drummond as "a shrew, yet honest". The identity of Jonson's wife has always been obscure, yet she sometimes is identified as "Ann Lewis", the woman who married a Benjamin Jonson in 1594, at the church of [[St Magnus-the-Martyr]], near [[London Bridge]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated612"&gt;"Ben Jonson", Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th Edition, p. 612.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the family of Anne Lewis and Ben Jonson, the St. Martin's Church registers indicate that Mary Jonson, their eldest daughter, died in November 1593, at six months of age. Then a decade later, in 1603, Benjamin Jonson, their eldest son, died of [[Bubonic plague]] when he was seven years old; to lament and honour the dead boy, Benjamin Jonson ''père'' wrote the elegiac ''[[On My First Sonne]]'' (1603). Moreover, 32 years later, a second son, also named Benjamin Jonson, died in 1635. In that period, Ann Lewis and Ben Jonson lived separate lives for five years; their matrimonial arrangement cast Ann Lewis as the housewife Jonson, and Ben Jonson as the artist who enjoyed the residential hospitality of his patrons, Sir Robert Townshend and Lord Aubigny, [[Esme Stuart, 3rd Duke of Lennox]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated612"/&gt;

==Career==
By summer 1597, Jonson had a fixed engagement in the [[Admiral's Men]], then performing under [[Philip Henslowe]]'s management at [[The Rose (theatre)|The Rose]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; [[John Aubrey]] reports, on uncertain authority, that Jonson was not successful as an actor; whatever his skills as an actor, he was evidently more valuable to the company as a writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowers|first1=Fredson T.|title=Ben Jonson the Actor|journal=Studies in Philology|date=July 1937|volume=34|issue=3|pages=392–406|jstor=4172372|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time Jonson had begun to write original plays for the Admiral's Men; in 1598 he was mentioned by [[Francis Meres]] in his ''Palladis Tamia'' as one of "the best for tragedy."&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; None of his early tragedies survive, however. An undated comedy, ''[[The Case is Altered]]'', may be his earliest surviving play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miola|first=Robert S.|year=2012|title=The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Ben Jonson|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|chapter=The Case Is Altered, Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1597 a play which he co-wrote with [[Thomas Nashe]], ''[[The Isle of Dogs (play)|The Isle of Dogs]]'', was suppressed after causing great offence. Arrest warrants for Jonson and Nashe were issued by Queen [[Elizabeth I]]'s so-called interrogator, [[Richard Topcliffe]]. Jonson was jailed in [[Marshalsea Prison]] and charged with "Leude and mutynous behaviour", while Nashe managed to escape to [[Great Yarmouth]]. Two of the actors, [[Gabriel Spenser]] and Robert Shaw, were also imprisoned. A year later, Jonson was again briefly imprisoned, this time in [[Newgate Prison]], for killing Gabriel Spenser in a [[duel]] on 22 September 1598 in Hogsden Fields&lt;ref name=Hawthornden/&gt; (today part of [[Hoxton]]). Tried on a charge of [[manslaughter]], Jonson pleaded guilty but was released by [[benefit of clergy]],&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; a legal ploy through which he gained leniency by reciting a brief bible verse (the [[neck-verse]]), forfeiting his 'goods and chattels' and being branded on his left thumb.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; While in jail Jonson converted to Catholicism, possibly through the influence of fellow-prisoner Father [[Thomas Wright (writer)|Thomas Wright]], a [[Jesuit]] priest.&lt;ref name="ID2008"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Donaldson |first=Ian |year=2008 |title=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, England |chapter=Benjamin Jonson (1572–1637) |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/15116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1598 Jonson produced his first great success, ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'', capitalising on the vogue for humorous plays which [[George Chapman]] had begun with ''[[An Humorous Day's Mirth]]''. [[William Shakespeare]] was among the first actors to be cast. Jonson followed this in 1599 with ''[[Every Man out of His Humour]]'', a pedantic attempt to imitate [[Aristophanes]]. It is not known whether this was a success on stage, but when published it proved popular and went through several editions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Jonson's other work for the theatre in the last years of [[Elizabeth I]]'s reign was marked by fighting and controversy. ''[[Cynthia's Revels]]'' was produced by the [[Children of the Chapel]] Royal at [[Blackfriars Theatre]] in 1600. It satirised both [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]], who Jonson believed had accused him of lustfulness in ''[[Histriomastix (play)|Histriomastix]]'', and [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]]. Jonson attacked the two poets again in ''[[Poetaster (play)|Poetaster]]'' (1601). Dekker responded with ''[[Satiromastix]]'', subtitled "the untrussing of the humorous poet".&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The final scene of this play, whilst certainly not to be taken at face value as a portrait of Jonson, offers a caricature that is recognisable from Drummond's report – boasting about himself and condemning other poets, criticising performances of his plays and calling attention to himself in any available way.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

This "[[War of the Theatres]]" appears to have ended with reconciliation on all sides. Jonson collaborated with Dekker on a [[procession|pageant]] welcoming [[James I of England|James I]] to England in 1603 although Drummond reports that Jonson called Dekker a rogue. Marston dedicated ''The Malcontent'' to Jonson and the two collaborated with Chapman on ''[[Eastward Ho]]'', a 1605 play whose anti-Scottish sentiment briefly landed both Jonson and Chapman in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gossett|first1=Suzanne|title=Marston, Collaboration, and "Eastward Ho!"|journal=Renaissance Drama|date=2004|volume=33|pages=181–200|jstor=41917391|accessdate=|series=New series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal patronage==
At the beginning of the English reign of [[James VI and I]] in 1603 Jonson joined other poets and playwrights in welcoming the new king. Jonson quickly adapted himself to the additional demand for [[masque]]s and entertainments introduced with the new reign and fostered by both the king and his consort&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; [[Anne of Denmark]]. In addition to his popularity on the public stage and in the royal hall, he enjoyed the patronage of aristocrats such as [[Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland|Elizabeth Sidney]] (daughter of [[Philip Sidney|Sir Philip Sidney]]) and [[Lady Mary Wroth]]. This connection with the Sidney family provided the impetus for one of Jonson's most famous lyrics, the [[country house poems|country house poem]] ''To [[Penshurst Place|Penshurst]]''.

In February 1603 [[John Manningham]] reported that Jonson was living on Robert Townsend, son of [[Roger Townshend (died 1590)|Sir Roger Townshend]], and "scorns the world."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Harvnb|Donaldson|2011|p=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps this explains why his trouble with English authorities continued. That same year he was questioned by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] about ''[[Sejanus His Fall|Sejanus]]'', a politically themed play about corruption in the Roman Empire. He was again in trouble for topical allusions in a play, now lost, in which he took part. Shortly after his release from a brief spell of imprisonment imposed to mark the authorities' displeasure at the work, in the second week of October 1605, he was present at a supper party attended by most of the [[Gunpowder Plot]] conspirators. After the plot's discovery he appears to have avoided further imprisonment; he volunteered what he knew of the affair to the investigator [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]] and the [[Privy Council]]. Father Thomas Wright, who heard Fawkes's confession, was known to Jonson from prison in 1598 and Cecil may have directed him to bring the priest before the council, as a witness.&lt;ref name="ID2008"/&gt; (Teague, 249).
[[File:Jonson 1616 folio Workes title page.jpg|200px|thumb|Title page of ''The Workes of Beniamin Ionson'' (1616), the first [[Folio (printing)|folio]] publication that included stage plays]]
At the same time, Jonson pursued a more prestigious career, writing masques for James's court. ''[[The Entertainment at Althorp|The Satyr]]'' (1603) and ''[[The Masque of Blackness]]'' (1605) are two of about two dozen masques which Jonson wrote for James or for Queen Anne, some of them performed at [[Apethorpe Palace]] when the King was in residence. ''The Masque of Blackness'' was praised by [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] as the consummate example of this now-extinct genre, which mingled speech, dancing and spectacle.

On many of these projects he collaborated, not always peacefully, with designer [[Inigo Jones]]. For example, Jones designed the scenery for Jonson's masque ''[[Oberon, the Faery Prince]]'' performed at [[Whitehall]] on 1 January 1611 in which [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]], eldest son of James I, appeared in the title role. Perhaps partly as a result of this new career, Jonson gave up writing plays for the public theatres for a decade. He later told Drummond that he had made less than two hundred pounds on all his plays together.

In 1616 Jonson received a yearly pension of 100 [[Mark (money)|marks]] (about £60), leading some to identify him as England's first [[Poet Laureate]]. This sign of royal favour may have encouraged him to publish the first volume of the folio collected edition of his works that year.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Other volumes followed in 1640–41 and 1692. (See: [[Ben Jonson folios]])

On 8 July 1618 Jonson set out from Bishopsgate in London to walk to Edinburgh, arriving in Scotland's capital on 17 September. For the most part he followed the great north road, and was treated to lavish and enthusiastic welcomes in both towns and country houses.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/884139272|title=Ben Jonson's walk to Scotland : an annotated edition of the 'foot voyage'|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Loxley, James, 1968-, Groundwater, Anna,, Sanders, Julie, 1968-|year=|isbn=9781107003330|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=94, 96|oclc=884139272}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his arrival he lodged initially with John Stuart, a cousin of King James, in Leith, and was made an honorary burgess of Edinburgh at a dinner laid on by the city on 26 September.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He stayed in Scotland until late January 1619, and the best-remembered hospitality he enjoyed was that of the Scottish poet, [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]],&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; sited on the [[River Esk, Lothian|River Esk]]. Drummond undertook to record as much of Jonson's conversation as he could in his diary, and thus recorded aspects of Jonson's personality that would otherwise have been less clearly seen. Jonson delivers his opinions, in Drummond's terse reporting, in an expansive and even magisterial mood. Drummond noted he was "a great lover and praiser of himself, a contemner and scorner of others".&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

On returning to England, he was awarded an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] [[academic degree|degree]] from Oxford University.

The period between 1605 and 1620 may be viewed as Jonson's heyday. By 1616 he had produced all the plays on which his present reputation as a dramatist is based, including the tragedy ''[[Catiline His Conspiracy|Catiline]]'' (acted and printed 1611), which achieved limited success&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; and the comedies ''[[Volpone]]'' (acted 1605 and printed in 1607), ''[[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman]]'' (1609), ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' (1610), ''[[Bartholomew Fayre: A Comedy|Bartholomew Fair]]'' (1614) and ''[[The Devil is an Ass]]'' (1616).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; ''The Alchemist'' and ''Volpone'' were immediately successful. Of ''Epicoene'', Jonson told Drummond of a satirical verse which reported that the play's subtitle was appropriate, since its audience had refused to applaud the play (i.e., remained silent). Yet ''Epicoene'', along with ''Bartholomew Fair'' and (to a lesser extent) ''The Devil is an Ass'' have in modern times achieved a certain degree of recognition. While his life during this period was apparently more settled than it had been in the 1590s, his financial security was still not assured.

==Religion==
Jonson recounted that his father had been a prosperous [[Protestant]] landowner until the reign of "[[Mary I of England|Bloody Mary]]" and had suffered imprisonment and the forfeiture of his wealth during that monarch's attempt to restore England to Catholicism. On [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s accession he was freed and was able to travel to London to become a clergyman.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson (2011: 56)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riggs (1989: 9)&lt;/ref&gt; (All that's known of Jonson's father, who died a month before his son was born, comes from the poet's own narrative.) Jonson's elementary education was in a small church school attached to [[St Martin-in-the-Fields#Medieval and Tudor|St Martin-in-the-Fields]] parish, and at the age of about seven he secured a place at [[Westminster School]], then part of [[Westminster Abbey]].

Notwithstanding this emphatically Protestant grounding, Jonson maintained an interest in Catholic doctrine throughout his adult life and, at a particularly perilous time while a religious war with Spain was widely expected and persecution of Catholics was intensifying, he converted to the faith.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson (2011: 176)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=R51&gt;Riggs (1989: 51–52)&lt;/ref&gt; This took place in October 1598, while Jonson was on remand in [[Newgate Prison|Newgate Gaol]] charged with manslaughter. Jonson's biographer Ian Donaldson is among those who suggest that the conversion was instigated by Father Thomas Wright, a [[Jesuit]] priest who had resigned from the order over his acceptance of Queen Elizabeth's right to rule in England.&lt;ref name=D134&gt;Donaldson (2011: 134–140)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harp; Stewart (2000: xiv)&lt;/ref&gt; Wright, although placed under [[house arrest]] on the orders of [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]], was permitted to minister to the inmates of London prisons.&lt;ref name="D134" /&gt; It may have been that Jonson, fearing that his trial would go against him, was seeking the unequivocal [[Absolution#Roman Catholic Church|
absolution]] that Catholicism could offer if he were sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="R51" /&gt; Alternatively, he could have been looking to personal advantage from accepting conversion since Father Wright's protector, the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], was among those who might hope to rise to influence after the succession of a new monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson (2011: 143)&lt;/ref&gt; Jonson's conversion came at a weighty time in affairs of state; the royal succession, from the childless Elizabeth, had not been settled and Essex's Catholic allies were hopeful that a sympathetic ruler might attain the throne.

Conviction, and certainly not expedience alone, sustained Jonson's faith during the troublesome twelve years he remained a Catholic. His stance received attention beyond the low-level intolerance to which most followers of that faith were exposed.

==Decline and death==
Jonson's productivity began to decline in the 1620s, but he remained well known.  In that time, rose to the prominence the [[Sons of Ben (literary group)|Sons of Ben]] or the "[[Tribe of Ben]]" - those younger poets such as [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]], [[Richard Lovelace]], and [[John Suckling (poet)|Sir John Suckling]] who took their bearing in verse from Jonson. However, a series of setbacks drained his strength and damaged his reputation. He resumed writing regular plays in the 1620s, but these are not considered among his best. They are of significant interest, however, for their portrayal of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s England. ''[[The Staple of News]]'', for example, offers a remarkable look at the earliest stage of English journalism. The lukewarm reception given that play was, however, nothing compared to the dismal failure of ''[[The New Inn]]''; the cold reception given this play prompted Jonson to write a poem condemning his audience (the ''Ode to Myself''), which in turn prompted [[Thomas Carew]], one of the "Tribe of Ben," to respond in a poem that asks Jonson to recognise his own decline.&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal factor in Jonson's partial eclipse was, however, the death of James and the accession of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] in 1625. Jonson felt neglected by the new court. A decisive quarrel with Jones harmed his career as a writer of court masques, although he continued to entertain the court on an irregular basis. For his part, Charles displayed a certain degree of care for the great poet of his father's day: he increased Jonson's annual pension to £100 and included a [[English units of wine casks#Tierce|tierce]] of wine and beer.

Despite the strokes that he suffered in the 1620s, Jonson continued to write. At his death in 1637 he seems to have been working on another play, ''The Sad Shepherd''. Though only two acts are extant, this represents a remarkable new direction for Jonson: a move into [[pastoral]] drama. During the early 1630s he also conducted a correspondence with [[James Howell]], who warned him about disfavour at court in the wake of his dispute with Jones.

Jonson died on or around 16 August 1637, and his funeral was held the next day. It was attended by 'all or the greatest part of the nobility then in town'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He is buried in the north aisle of the nave in [[Westminster Abbey]], with the inscription "O Rare Ben Johnson ''[sic]''" set in the slab over his grave.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref name=DCWA&gt;{{cite web |title=Monuments &amp; Gravestones: Ben Jonson |work=Westminster Abbey 1065 to today |publisher=Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey |url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/history-research/monuments-gravestones/people/12177 |accessdate=26 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107172342/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/history-research/monuments-gravestones/people/12177 |archivedate=7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Aubrey]], in a more meticulous record than usual, notes that a passer-by, John Young of [[Great Milton]], [[Oxfordshire]], saw the bare grave marker and on impulse paid a workman eighteen pence to make the inscription. Another theory suggests that the tribute came from [[William Davenant]], Jonson's successor as Poet Laureate (and card-playing companion of Young), as the same phrase appears on Davenant's nearby gravestone, but essayist [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]] contends that Davenant's wording represented no more than Young's coinage, cheaply re-used.&lt;ref name=DCWA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hunt |first=Leigh |date=9 April 1828 |title=Life of Sir William Davenant, with specimens of his poetry |series=The Companion |volume=XIV |page=187 |chapter=His epitaph, and Ben Jonson's |oclc=2853686}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Jonson was buried in an upright position was an indication of his reduced circumstances at the time of his death,&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Quincy Adams|Adams, J. Q.]] ''The Jonson Allusion Book''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1922. pp. 195–6&lt;/ref&gt; although it has also been written that he asked for a grave exactly 18&amp;nbsp;inches square from the monarch and received an upright grave to fit in the requested space.&lt;ref name="world and its people"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dunton |first=Larkin |year=1896 |title=The World and Its People |publisher=Silver, Burdett |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson (2011:1)&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed that the inscription could be read "Orare Ben Jonson" (pray for Ben Jonson), possibly in an allusion to Jonson's acceptance of [[Roman Catholic theology|Catholic doctrine]] during his lifetime (although he had returned to the Church of England) but the carving shows a distinct space between  "O" and "rare".&lt;ref name="ID2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Stubbs |first=John |date=24 February 2011 |title=Reprobates |publisher=Viking Penguin |location=London |isbn=978-0-670-91753-2 |page=182 |quote=…a plea for the passerby's prayers (the Latin imperative ''orare'')…}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fletcher |first=Angus |year=2007 |title=Time, space, and motion in the age of Shakespeare |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=978-0-674-02308-6 |page=95 |chapter=Structure of an epitaph |quote=At first sight the words seem clear enough…but some…have believed that the words intended to say, in Latin, "Pray for Ben Jonson"…}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A monument to Jonson was erected in about 1723 by the Earl of Oxford and is in the eastern aisle of Westminster Abbey's [[Poets' Corner]]. It includes a portrait medallion and the same inscription as on the gravestone. It seems Jonson was to have had a monument erected by subscription soon after his death but the [[English Civil War]] intervened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/ben-jonson |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083717/http://westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/ben-jonson |archivedate=19 August 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==His work==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2017}}&lt;!--only one citation in two sections--&gt;

===Drama===
Apart from two tragedies, ''[[Sejanus (play)|Sejanus]]'' and ''[[Catiline: His Conspiracy|Catiline]]'', that largely failed to impress Renaissance audiences, Jonson's work for the public theatres was in comedy. These plays vary in some respects. The minor early plays, particularly those written for [[boy player]]s, present somewhat looser plots and less-developed characters than those written later, for adult companies. Already in the plays which were his salvos in the Poet's War, he displays the keen eye for absurdity and hypocrisy that marks his best-known plays; in these early efforts, however, plot mostly takes second place to variety of incident and comic set-pieces. They are, also, notably ill-tempered. [[Thomas Davies (bookseller)|Thomas Davies]] called ''Poetaster'' "a contemptible mixture of the serio-comic, where the names of [[Augustus Caesar]], [[Maecenas]], [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], [[Ovid]] and [[Tibullus]], are all sacrificed upon the altar of private resentment." Another early comedy in a different vein, ''[[The Case is Altered]]'', is markedly similar to Shakespeare's romantic comedies in its foreign setting, emphasis on genial wit and love-plot. Henslowe's diary indicates that Jonson had a hand in numerous other plays, including many in genres such as English history with which he is not otherwise associated.

The comedies of his middle career, from ''[[Eastward Ho]]'' to ''[[The Devil is an Ass]]'' are for the most part [[city comedy]], with a London setting, themes of trickery and money, and a distinct moral ambiguity, despite Jonson's professed aim in the Prologue to ''[[Volpone]]'' to "mix profit with your pleasure". His late plays or "[[dotages]]", particularly ''[[The Magnetic Lady]]'' and ''The Sad Shepherd'', exhibit signs of an accommodation with the romantic tendencies of [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan comedy]].

Within this general progression, however, Jonson's comic style remained constant and easily recognisable. He announces his programme in the prologue to the [[folio (printing)|folio]] version of ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'': he promises to represent "deeds, and language, such as men do use." He planned to write comedies that revived the classical premises of Elizabethan dramatic theory—or rather, since all but the loosest English comedies could claim some descent from [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]], he intended to apply those premises with rigour.&lt;ref&gt;Doran, 120ff&lt;/ref&gt; This commitment entailed negations: after ''The Case is Altered'', Jonson eschewed distant locations, noble characters, romantic plots and other staples of Elizabethan comedy, focusing instead on the satiric and realistic inheritance of [[new comedy]]. He set his plays in contemporary settings, peopled them with recognisable types, and set them to actions that, if not strictly realistic, involved everyday motives such as greed and [[jealousy]]. In accordance with the temper of his age, he was often so broad in his characterisation that many of his most famous scenes border on the [[farce|farcical]] (as [[William Congreve]], for example, judged ''Epicoene''.) He was more diligent in adhering to the [[classical unities]] than many of his peers—although as [[Margaret Cavendish]] noted, the unity of action in the major comedies was rather compromised by Jonson's abundance of incident. To this classical model Jonson applied the two features of his style which save his classical imitations from mere pedantry: the vividness with which he depicted the lives of his characters, and the intricacy of his plots. Coleridge, for instance, claimed that ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' had one of the three most perfect plots in literature.

===Poetry===
[[File:Houghton MS Lowell Autograph File 185, Jonson.jpg|thumb|"Epitaph for Cecilia Bulstrode" manuscript, 1609]]
Jonson's poetry, like his drama, is informed by his classical learning. Some of his better-known poems are close translations of Greek or Roman models; all display the careful attention to form and style that often came naturally to those trained in classics in the [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] manner. Jonson largely avoided the debates about rhyme and meter that had consumed Elizabethan classicists such as [[Thomas Campion]] and [[Gabriel Harvey]]. Accepting both rhyme and stress, Jonson used them to mimic the classical qualities of simplicity, restraint and precision.

"Epigrams" (published in the 1616 folio) is an entry in a genre that was popular among late-Elizabethan and Jacobean audiences, although Jonson was perhaps the only poet of his time to work in its full classical range. The epigrams explore various attitudes, most from the satiric stock of the day: complaints against women, courtiers and spies abound. The condemnatory poems are short and anonymous; Jonson’s epigrams of praise, including a famous poem to Camden and lines to Lucy Harington, are longer and are mostly addressed to specific individuals. Although it is included among the epigrams, "[[On My First Sonne]]" is neither satirical nor very short; the poem, intensely personal and deeply felt, typifies a genre that would come to be called "lyric poetry." It is possible that the spelling of 'son' as 'Sonne' is meant to allude to the [[sonnet]] form, with which it shares some features. A few other so-called epigrams share this quality. Jonson's poems of "The Forest" also appeared in the first folio. Most of the fifteen poems are addressed to Jonson's aristocratic supporters, but the most famous are his country-house poem “[[To Penshurst]]” and the poem “[[To Celia]]” ("Come, my Celia, let us prove") that appears also in ''[[Volpone]]''.

''Underwood'', published in the expanded folio of 1640, is a larger and more heterogeneous group of poems. It contains ''[[A Celebration of Charis]]'', Jonson's most extended effort at love poetry; various religious pieces; [[Encomium|encomiastic poems]] including the poem to Shakespeare and a sonnet on [[Mary Wroth]]; the ''[[Execration against Vulcan]]'' and others. The 1640 volume also contains three elegies which have often been ascribed to Donne (one of them appeared in Donne's posthumous collected poems).

==Relationship with Shakespeare==
[[File:Shakespeare and Jonson at the Mermaid Tavern.jpg|thumb|A 19th century engraving illustrating [[Thomas Fuller]]'s story of [[Shakespeare]] and Jonson debating at the "[[Mermaid Tavern]]".]]

There are many legends about Jonson's rivalry with [[Shakespeare]], some of which may be true.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} Drummond reports that during their conversation, Jonson scoffed at two apparent absurdities in Shakespeare's plays: a nonsensical line in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', and the setting of ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' on the non-existent seacoast of Bohemia. Drummond also reported Jonson as saying that Shakespeare "wanted art" (i.e., lacked skill). Whether Drummond is viewed as accurate or not, the comments fit well with Jonson's well-known theories about literature.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In [[s:On Shakespeare|"De Shakespeare Nostrat"]] in ''Timber'', which was published posthumously and reflects his lifetime of practical experience, Jonson offers a fuller and more conciliatory comment. He recalls being told by certain actors that Shakespeare never blotted (i.e., crossed out) a line when he wrote. His own claimed response was "Would he had blotted a thousand!"{{efn|Jonson's claim is interesting, since early printings of Shakespeare's work suggest that he tended to start a scene before giving up and trying again. His failure to cross the original attempts out left his printers unsure what needed to be deleted, though also allowed an insight into his creative process.}} However, Jonson explains, "He was, indeed, honest and of an open and free nature, had an excellent phantasy, brave notions and gentle expressions, wherein he flowed with that facility that sometimes it was necessary he should be stopped".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/dscv10h.htm#footnote11 Gutenberg.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Jonson concludes that "there was ever more in him to be praised than to be pardoned." Also when Shakespeare died, he said, "He was not of an age, but for all time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pogue |first1=Kate Emery |year=2006 |title=Shakespeare's Friends |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oy29eyCMNycC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=%22praised+than+to+be+pardoned%22+%22age+but+for+all+time%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22praised%20than%20to%20be%20pardoned%22%20%22age%20but%20for%20all%20time%22&amp;f=false |location=London |publisher=Praeger |page=99 |isbn=0275989569 |access-date=25 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Fuller]] relates stories of Jonson and Shakespeare engaging in debates in the [[Mermaid Tavern]]; Fuller imagines conversations in which Shakespeare would run rings around the more learned but more ponderous Jonson. That the two men knew each other personally is beyond doubt, not only because of the tone of Jonson's references to him but because Shakespeare's company produced a number of Jonson's plays, at least two of which (''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' and ''[[Sejanus His Fall]]'') Shakespeare certainly acted in. However, it is now impossible to tell how much personal communication they had, and tales of their friendship cannot be substantiated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Jonson's most influential and revealing commentary on Shakespeare is the second of the two poems that he contributed to the prefatory verse that opens Shakespeare's [[First Folio]]. This poem, [[s:To the Memory of My Beloved the Author, Mr. William Shakespeare and What He Hath Left Us|"To the Memory of My Beloved the Author, Mr. William Shakespeare and What He Hath Left Us"]], did a good deal to create the traditional view of Shakespeare as a poet who, despite "small Latine, and lesse Greeke",&lt;ref&gt;W.T. Baldwin [https://web.archive.org/web/20060904145150/http://durer.press.uiuc.edu/baldwin/vol.1/html/2.html 's ''William Shakspere's Smalle Latine and Lesse Greeke'', 1944]&lt;/ref&gt; had a natural genius. The poem has traditionally been thought to exemplify the contrast which Jonson perceived between himself, the disciplined and erudite classicist, scornful of ignorance and sceptical of the masses, and Shakespeare, represented in the poem as a kind of natural wonder whose genius was not subject to any rules except those of the audiences for which he wrote. But the poem itself qualifies this view:
:Yet must I not give Nature all: Thy Art,
:My gentle Shakespeare, must enjoy a part.

Some view this elegy as a conventional exercise, but others see it as a heartfelt tribute to the "Sweet Swan of Avon", the "Soul of the Age!" It has been argued that Jonson helped to edit the [[First Folio]], and he may have been inspired to write this poem by reading his fellow playwright's works, a number of which had been previously either unpublished or available in less satisfactory versions, in a relatively complete form.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Reception and influence==
Jonson was a towering literary figure, and his influence was enormous for he has been described as 'One of the most vigorous minds that ever added to the strength of English literature'.&lt;ref&gt;Morley, Henry, Introduction to ''Discoveries Made Upon Men and Matter and Some Poems'' 1892 kindle ebook 2011 ASIN B004TOT8FQ&lt;/ref&gt; Before the English Civil War, the "Tribe of Ben" touted his importance, and during the Restoration Jonson's satirical comedies and his theory and practice of "humour characters" (which are often misunderstood; see William Congreve's letters for clarification) was extremely influential, providing the blueprint for many Restoration comedies. [[John Aubrey]] wrote of Jonson in "[[Brief Lives]]." By 1700 Jonson's status began to decline. In the Romantic era, Jonson suffered the fate of being unfairly compared and contrasted to Shakespeare, as the taste for Jonson's type of satirical comedy decreased. Jonson was at times greatly appreciated by the Romantics, but overall he was denigrated for not writing in a Shakespearean vein.

In 2012, after more than two decades of research, [[Cambridge University Press]] published the first new edition of Jonson's complete works for 60 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/9423214/Why-should-William-Shakespeare-have-the-last-word-over-Ben-Jonson.html|title=Why should William Shakespeare have the last word over Ben Jonson?|date=24 July 2012|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drama===
As G. E. Bentley notes in ''Shakespeare and Jonson: Their Reputations in the Seventeenth Century Compared'', Jonson's reputation was in some respects equal to Shakespeare's in the 17th century. After the English theatres were reopened on the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], Jonson's work, along with Shakespeare's and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher]]'s, formed the initial core of the Restoration repertory. It was not until after 1710 that Shakespeare's plays (ordinarily in heavily revised forms) were more frequently performed than those of his Renaissance contemporaries. Many critics since the 18th century have ranked Jonson below only Shakespeare among [[English Renaissance theatre|English Renaissance dramatists]]. Critical judgment has tended to emphasise the very qualities that Jonson himself lauds in his prefaces, in ''Timber'', and in his scattered prefaces and dedications: the realism and propriety of his language, the bite of his satire, and the care with which he plotted his comedies.

For some critics, the temptation to contrast Jonson (representing art or craft) with Shakespeare (representing nature, or untutored genius) has seemed natural; Jonson himself may be said to have initiated this interpretation in the second folio, and [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]] drew the same comparison in his [[commonplace book]] later in the century.

At the Restoration, this sensed difference became a kind of critical dogma. [[Charles de Saint-Évremond]] placed Jonson's comedies above all else in English drama, and [[Charles Gildon]] called Jonson the father of English comedy. [[John Dryden]] offered a more common assessment in the "Essay of Dramatic Poesie," in which his [[Avatar]] Neander compares Shakespeare to [[Homer]] and Jonson to [[Virgil]]: the former represented profound creativity, the latter polished artifice. But "artifice" was in the 17th century almost synonymous with "art"; Jonson, for instance, used "artificer" as a synonym for "artist" (''Discoveries,'' 33). For [[Lewis Theobald]], too, Jonson "ow[ed] all his Excellence to his Art,” in contrast to Shakespeare, the natural genius. [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]], to whom may be traced the legend that Jonson owed the production of ''Every Man in his Humour'' to Shakespeare's intercession, likewise attributed Jonson's excellence to learning, which did not raise him quite to the level of genius. A consensus formed: Jonson was the first English poet to understand classical precepts with any accuracy, and he was the first to apply those precepts successfully to contemporary life. But there were also more negative spins on Jonson's learned art; for instance, in the 1750s, [[Edward Young]] casually remarked on the way in which Jonson's learning worked, like Samson's strength, to his own detriment. Earlier, [[Aphra Behn]], writing in defence of female playwrights, had pointed to Jonson as a writer whose learning did not make him popular; unsurprisingly, she compares him unfavourably to Shakespeare. Particularly in the tragedies, with their lengthy speeches abstracted from [[Sallust]] and [[Cicero]], [[Augustan literature|Augustan]] critics saw a writer whose learning had swamped his [[aesthetic]] judgment.

In this period, [[Alexander Pope]] is exceptional in that he noted the tendency to exaggeration in these competing critical portraits: "It is ever the nature of Parties to be in extremes; and nothing is so probable, as that because Ben Johnson had much the most learning, it was said on the one hand that Shakespear had none at all; and because Shakespear had much the most wit and fancy, it was retorted on the other, that Johnson wanted both."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Pope, ed. ''Works of Shakespeare'' (London, 1725), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; For the most part, the 18th century consensus remained committed to the division that Pope doubted; as late as the 1750s, [[Sarah Fielding]] could put a brief recapitulation of this analysis in the mouth of a "man of sense" encountered by David Simple.

Though his stature declined during the 18th century, Jonson was still read and commented on throughout the century, generally in the kind of comparative and dismissive terms just described. [[Heinrich Wilhelm von Gerstenberg]] translated parts of [[Peter Whalley (clergyman)|Peter Whalley]]'s edition into German in 1765. Shortly before the Romantic revolution, [[Edward Capell]] offered an almost unqualified rejection of Jonson as a dramatic poet, who (he writes) "has very poor pretensions to the high place he holds among the English Bards, as there is no original manner to distinguish him and the tedious sameness visible in his plots indicates a defect of Genius."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Craig, D. H., ed. ''Jonson: The Critical Heritage'' (London: Routledge, 1995). p. 499&lt;/ref&gt; The disastrous failures of productions of ''Volpone'' and ''Epicoene'' in the early 1770s no doubt bolstered a widespread sense that Jonson had at last grown too antiquated for the contemporary public; if he still attracted enthusiasts such as [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Earl Camden]] and [[William Gifford]], he all but disappeared from the stage in the last quarter of the century.

The [[Romanticism|romantic]] revolution in criticism brought about an overall decline in the critical estimation of Jonson. Hazlitt refers dismissively to Jonson's "laborious caution." Coleridge, while more respectful, describes Jonson as psychologically superficial: “He was a very accurately observing man; but he cared only to observe what was open to, and likely to impress, the senses.” Coleridge placed Jonson second only to Shakespeare; other romantic critics were less approving. The early 19th century was the great age for recovering Renaissance drama. Jonson, whose reputation had survived, appears to have been less interesting to some readers than writers such as [[Thomas Middleton]] or [[John Heywood]], who were in some senses "discoveries" of the 19th century. Moreover, the emphasis which the romantic writers placed on imagination, and their concomitant tendency to distrust studied art, lowered Jonson's status, if it also sharpened their awareness of the difference traditionally noted between Jonson and Shakespeare. This trend was by no means universal, however; [[William Gifford]], Jonson's first editor of the 19th century, did a great deal to defend Jonson's reputation during this period of general decline. In the next era, [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburne]], who was more interested in Jonson than most [[Victorians]], wrote, "The flowers of his growing have every quality but one which belongs to the rarest and finest among flowers: they have colour, form, variety, fertility, vigour: the one thing they want is fragrance” – by “fragrance,” Swinburne means spontaneity.

In the 20th century, Jonson’s body of work has been subject to a more varied set of analyses, broadly consistent with the interests and programmes of modern literary criticism. In an essay printed in ''The Sacred Wood'', [[T. S. Eliot]] attempted to repudiate the charge that Jonson was an arid classicist by analysing the role of imagination in his dialogue. Eliot was appreciative of Jonson's overall conception and his "surface", a view consonant with the modernist reaction against Romantic criticism, which tended to denigrate playwrights who did not concentrate on representations of psychological depth. Around mid-century, a number of critics and scholars followed Eliot's lead, producing detailed studies of Jonson's verbal style. At the same time, study of Elizabethan themes and conventions, such as those by [[E. E. Stoll]] and [[M. C. Bradbrook]], provided a more vivid sense of how Jonson's work was shaped by the expectations of his time.

The proliferation of new critical perspectives after mid-century touched on Jonson inconsistently. Jonas Barish was the leading figure among critics who appreciated Jonson's artistry. On the other hand, Jonson received less attention from the new critics than did some other playwrights and his work was not of programmatic interest to psychoanalytic critics. But Jonson's career eventually made him a focal point for the revived [[New Historicism|sociopolitical criticism]]. Jonson's works, particularly his masques and pageants, offer significant information regarding the relations of literary production and political power, as do his contacts with and poems for aristocratic patrons; moreover, his career at the centre of London's emerging literary world has been seen as exemplifying the development of a fully commodified literary culture. In this respect he is seen as a transitional figure, an author whose skills and ambition led him to a leading role both in the declining culture of [[patronage]] and in the rising culture of mass consumption.

===Poetry===
Jonson has been called 'the first poet laureate'.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Michael, ''Lives of the Poets'', Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson 1998 {{ISBN|9780753807453}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Jonson's reputation as a playwright has traditionally been linked to Shakespeare, his reputation as a poet has, since the early 20th century, been linked to that of [[John Donne]]. In this comparison, Jonson represents the [[Cavalier poet|cavalier]] strain of poetry, emphasising grace and clarity of expression; Donne, by contrast, epitomised the [[Metaphysical poets|metaphysical]] school of poetry, with its reliance on strained, [[baroque]] metaphors and often vague phrasing. Since the critics who made this comparison ([[Herbert Grierson]] for example), were to varying extents rediscovering Donne, this comparison often worked to the detriment of Jonson's reputation.

In his time Jonson was at least as influential as Donne. In 1623, historian [[Edmund Bolton]] named him the best and most polished English poet. That this judgment was widely shared is indicated by the admitted influence he had on younger poets. The grounds for describing Jonson as the "father" of cavalier poets are clear: many of the cavalier poets described themselves as his "sons" or his "tribe". For some of this tribe, the connection was as much social as poetic; [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Herrick]] described meetings at "the Sun, the Dog, the Triple Tunne".&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; All of them, including those like Herrick whose accomplishments in verse are generally regarded as superior to Jonson's, took inspiration from Jonson's revival of classical forms and themes, his subtle melodies, and his disciplined use of [[wit]]. In these respects Jonson may be regarded as among the most important figures in the prehistory of English [[Augustan literature|neoclassicism]].

The best of Jonson's lyrics have remained current since his time; periodically, they experience a brief vogue, as after the publication of Peter Whalley's edition of 1756. Jonson's poetry continues to interest scholars for the light which it sheds on English literary history, such as politics, systems of patronage and intellectual attitudes. For the general reader, Jonson's reputation rests on a few lyrics that, though brief, are surpassed for grace and precision by very few Renaissance poems: "[[On My First Sonne]]"; "[[To Celia]]"; "[[To Penshurst]]"; and the [[epitaph]] on Salomon Pavy, a [[boy player]]  abducted from his parents who acted in Jonson's plays.

*''On My First Sonne'' (1616), [[elegy]]
*''A Discourse of Love'' (1618)
*[[John Barclay (poet)|Barclay]]'s ''[[Argenis]]'', translated by Jonson (1623)
*''The Execration against Vulcan'' (1640)
*[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|''Horace's Art of Poetry'']], translated by Jonson (1640), with a [[commendatory verse]] by [[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury|Edward Herbert]]
*''Underwood'' (1640)
* ''English Grammar'' (1640)
*''Timber, or Discoveries made upon men and matter, as they have flowed out of his daily readings, or had their reflux to his peculiar notion of the times,'' a commonplace book
*''[[To Celia]]'' ''(Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes)'', poem

It is in Jonson's ''Timber, or Discoveries...'' that he famously quipped on the manner in which language became a measure of the speaker or writer:

{{quote|Language most shows a man: Speak, that I may see thee. It springs out of the most retired and inmost parts of us, and is the image of the parent of it, the mind. No glass renders a man’s form or likeness so true as his speech. Nay, it is likened to a man; and as we consider feature and composition in a man, so words in language; in the greatness, aptness, sound structure, and harmony of it.|Ben Jonson, 1640 (posthumous)&lt;ref&gt;Jonson, B., "Discoveries and Some Poems," Cassell &amp; Company, 1892.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As with other English Renaissance dramatists, a portion of Ben Jonson's literary output has not survived. In addition to ''[[The Isle of Dogs (play)|The Isle of Dogs]]'' (1597), the records suggest these lost plays as wholly or partially Jonson's work: ''Richard Crookback'' (1602); ''Hot Anger Soon Cold'' (1598), with Porter and [[Henry Chettle]]; ''Page of Plymouth'' (1599), with Dekker; and ''Robert II, King of Scots'' (1599), with Chettle and Dekker. Several of Jonson's masques and entertainments also are not extant: ''The Entertainment at Merchant Taylors'' (1607); ''The Entertainment at Salisbury House for James I'' (1608); and ''The May Lord'' (1613–19).

Finally, there are questionable or borderline attributions. Jonson may have had a hand in ''[[Rollo Duke of Normandy|Rollo, Duke of Normandy, or The Bloody Brother]]'', a play in the canon of John Fletcher and his collaborators. The comedy ''[[The Widow (play)|The Widow]]'' was printed in 1652 as the work of [[Thomas Middleton]], Fletcher and Jonson, though scholars have been intensely sceptical about Jonson's presence in the play. A few attributions of anonymous plays, such as ''[[The London Prodigal]]'', have been ventured by individual researchers, but have met with cool responses.&lt;ref&gt;Logan and Smith, pp. 82–92&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance''', also referred to as '''BAAD!''', is a New York performing and visual art workshop space and performance venue located in [[The Bronx]].&lt;ref name="spacefinder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nyc.spacefinder.org/organizations/4107|title=BAAD ! the Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance - SpaceFinder NYC|publisher=nyc.spacefinder.org|accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy is home to the Arthur Aviles Typical Theatre and The Bronx Dance Coalition.

== History ==
The Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance was co-founded in 1998 by [[Arthur Aviles]], dancer and choreographer who performed with the [[Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company]], and Charles Rice-Gonzales, a writer, activist, and publicist.&lt;ref name="nycartscoalition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nycartscoalition.org/|title=NYC Arts Coalition|publisher=nycartscoalition.org|accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nydailynews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/dominican-dance-traditions-alive-special-performance-hostos-community-college-article-1.952236|title=Hostos features Dominican traditional dance - NY Daily News|publisher=nydailynews.com|accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy was first located in a community center before renting space in the historic [[American Bank Note Company Printing Plant]] in the [[Hunts Point, Bronx|Hunts Point]] neighborhood of the [[South Bronx]] and was home to the Arthur Aviles Typical Theatre, a contemporary dance company focusing on works exploring the margins of Latino and LGBTQ cultures.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/28/nyregion/in-new-home-bronx-dance-academy-seeks-to-step-up-its-presence.html?_r=2&lt;/ref&gt; The programs at BAAD! were made up of dancers, LGBTQ visual artists, women, and artists of color.&lt;ref name="baadbronx"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baadbronx.org/about.html|title=About|publisher=baadbronx.org|accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists began presenting work in the space and hosting annual arts festivals such as ''BAAD! Ass Women'', ''Out Like That!'', ''The BlakTino Performance Series'', ''The Boogie Down Dance Series'', and the holiday play ''Los Nutcrackers: A Christmas Carajo''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/arts-festival-hunts-point-celebrates-women-film-dance-poetry-theater-self-defense-workshop-article-1.1037673&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 a film event series, titled ''Get Tough! Get BAAD!'' focusing on gay-bashings in New York City, was added.&lt;ref name="baadbronx"/&gt; ''Out Like That!'' is the Bronx's only festival celebrating works by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender artists.&lt;ref name="nyc-arts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc-arts.org/organizations/2181/bronx-academy-of-arts-and-dance|title=Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance - NYC-ARTS|publisher=nyc-arts.org|accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the Bronx Dance Coalition, which supports professional Bronx dance and published the ''Bronx Dance Magazine'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pepatian.org/public_html/pdf/back_issue_05.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was formed at the Academy. Later the Muse/Artist in Residency Project was started.

After 14 years in the American Bank Note Company Building, the Academy was forced to leave due to increasing rent. In October 2013, the Academy relocated to a gothic revivalist chapel in the cemetery on the grounds of the historic [[St. Peter's Church, Chapel and Cemetery Complex|St. Peter's Episcopal Church]] in [[Westchester Square, Bronx|Westchester Square]].&lt;ref name="cuny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brie.hunter.cuny.edu/hpe/2013/10/28/legendary-dance-group-gone-from-banknote/|title=Hunts Point Express &amp;#8211; Legendary dance group gone from BankNote|publisher=brie.hunter.cuny.edu|accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapel that houses the Academy was made a [[List of New York City Designated Landmarks in The Bronx|New York City Landmark]] in 1976 and was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;http://npgallery.nps.gov/nrhp/Download?path=/natreg/docs/All_Data.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 [[The New York Times]] crowned BAAD! "a funky and welcoming performance space" and Theater Journal said, "they have created a space for art in an environment that seems antithetical to that act. The Academy received the Mayor's Art and Culture Award.&lt;ref name="harlemonestop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harlemonestop.com/organization/1385/bronx-academy-of-arts-dance-baad|title=Bronx Academy of Arts &amp; Dance (BAAD!), Other - Harlem One Stop|publisher=harlemonestop.com|accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 they were one of 12 grantees to receive a grant from the Lincoln Center Cultural Innovation Fund and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] in order to &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lincolncenterculturalinnovationfund.org/|title=Lincoln Center Cultural Innovation Fund|website=Lincoln Center Cultural Innovation Fund|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; "increase arts access and participation in the diverse neighborhoods of the [[South Bronx]] and [[Central Brooklyn]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thebronxchronicle.com/2017/06/28/recipients-from-central-brooklyn-and-south-bronx-receive-support-for-innovative-community-based-cultural-programs/|title=Recipients From Central Brooklyn and South Bronx Receive Support For Innovative Community-Based Cultural Programs - The Bronx Chronicle|date=2017-06-28|work=The Bronx Chronicle|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 60K grant will be used for the Transvisionaries:Live Performance Series, a monthly free performance series featuring trans and [[gender non-conforming]] artists or color, hosted at local cafes in the South Bronx. The goal being to increase access to performance outside the theater while bringing visibility to [[Transgender|trans people]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Calcutta Film Society''' was  [[India]]’s second [[film society]] in the city of [[Kolkata]] (then Calcutta), [[West Bengal]], [[India]]. It was founded in 1947, just after independence, by [[Satyajit Ray]], [[Chidananda Dasgupta]], RP Gupta, [[Bansi Chandragupta]] and others. The 1925 silent film directed by [[Sergei Eisenstein]], ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' was the first film screened at the film society,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satyajitray.org/bio/film_society.htm Calcutta Film Society] [[Satyajit Ray]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; which over the years developed the reputation of having the "most cine-literate audiences in the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/the-film-fan-frat/406877/|title=The film fan frat|date=4 September 2010|work=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1080525/jsp/calcutta/story_9316488.jsp|title=The End|date=25 May 2008|first=Malini|last=Banerjee|newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today it is seen as an important harbinger of New Wave cinema in India, as it allowed first hand access to world cinema to local viewers and in time started the film society movement in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armes|first=Roy |title=Third World film making and the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFDnqIwdr8EC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=Calcutta+Film+Society&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=Calcutta%20Film%20Society&amp;f=false|year=1987|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-05690-6|pages=118, 123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Although a film society was formed by documentary filmmakers in Bombay in 1942, this was the first film society dedicated to feature films. Satyajit Ray then a young aspiring film maker provided film books and magazines, while [[Chidananda Dasgupta]] offer a room in his home for the meetings. And despite tough censorship policies, under the "Indian Cinematograph Act 1918" of the [[British Raj]], which still in enforced censorship rule to all gathering for cinema viewing, they survived low membership during the first five years viewing mainly Russian and European films. The society also started a bulletin designed by Ray, and several of his article were later published in the book, ''[[Our Films, Their Films]]'' (1972). Noted film personalities were invited to speak at the society which they did on several occasions, including Russian actor, [[Nikolay Konstantinovich Cherkasov|Nikolay Cherkasov]], directors [[Jean Renoir]], [[John Huston]]. Ray later recounted his meeting with Renoir as an important turning point in shaping his cinematic vision of his first film, ''[[Pather Panchali]]'' which he explained to Renoir when he was visiting India to look for locations for his film ''[[The River (1951 film)|The River]]'', in which Ray assisted Renoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Andrew |title=Satyajit Ray: the inner eye|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TnkcLvYRNfMC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=Calcutta+Film+Society&amp;cd=10#v=onepage&amp;q=Calcutta%20Film%20Society&amp;f=false|year=1989|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-06946-3|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years, when the first [[International Film Festival of India]] was organized in 1952, the society was extensively consulted for the films to be invited to the festival. The festival according to film historian, [[Jerzy Toeplitz]] became a turning point in the history of [[Indian cinema]] as it was first time, Indian audience had access to [[Italian neorealism]] as well as new Japanese cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Binford|first=Mira Reym |title=Media policy as a catalyst to creativity: the role of government in the development of India's new cinema|year=1983|publisher=University of Wisconsin--Madison|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27199">{{Main article|Characteristics of Harold Pinter's work#"Comedy of menace"}}
'''Comedy of menace''' is the body of plays written by [[David Campton]], [[Nigel Dennis]], [[N. F. Simpson]], and [[Harold Pinter]].  The term was coined by drama critic [[Irving Wardle]], who borrowed it from the subtitle of Campton's play ''[[The Lunatic View: A Comedy of Menace]]'', in reviewing Pinter's and Campton's plays in ''[[Encore (magazine)|Encore]]'' in 1958.  (Campton's subtitle ''Comedy of Menace'' is a jocular play-on-words derived from ''[[comedy of manners]]''—''menace'' being ''manners'' pronounced with somewhat of a Judeo-English accent.)&lt;ref name=Merritt&gt;See Merritt 5, 9–10, 225–28, 240, 310, and 326, citing articles by Wardle, Gussow's ''Conversations with Pinter'', and various performance reviews by Wardle, Gussow, and others.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Citing Wardle's original publications in ''Encore'' magazine (1958), Susan Hollis Merritt points out that in "Comedy of Menace" Wardle "first applies this label to Pinter's work … describ[ing] Pinter as one of 'several playwrights who have been tentatively lumped together as the "non-naturalists" or "abstractionists"&amp;nbsp;' (28)" (Merritt 225).  His article "Comedy of Menace," Merritt continues,
&lt;blockquote&gt;centers on ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'' because it is the only play of Pinter's that Wardle had seen [and reviewed] at the time, yet he speculates on the basis of "descriptions of [Pinter's] other plays, '[[The Room (play)|The Room]]' and '[[The Dumb Waiter]]', [that Pinter] is a writer dogged by one image—the womb" (33).  Mentioning the acknowledged "literary influences" on Pinter's work—"Beckett, Kafka and American gangster films"—Wardle argues that "&amp;nbsp;'The Birthday Party' exemplifies the type of comic menace which gave rise to this article." (225)&lt;ref&gt;[[Cf.]] Billington 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In "Comedy of Menace", as Merritt observes, on the basis of his experience of ''The Birthday Party'' and others' accounts of the other two plays, Wardle proposes that "Comedy enables the committed agents and victims of destruction to come on and off duty; to joke about the situation while oiling a revolver; to display absurd or endearing features behind their masks of implacable resolution; to meet … in paper hats for a game of blind man's buff"; he suggests how "menace" in Pinter's plays "stands for something more substantial: destiny," and that destiny, "handled in this way—not as an austere exercise in classicism, but as an incurable disease which one forgets about most of the time and whose lethal reminders may take the form of a joke—is an apt dramatic motif for an age of conditioned behaviour in which orthodox man is a willing collaborator in his own destruction" (Wardle, "Comedy of Menace" 33; rpt. in ''The Encore Reader'' 91).

"Just two years later" (1960), however, Wardle retracted "Comedy of Menace" in his review of ''[[The Caretaker]]'', stating: "On the strength of 'The Birthday Party' and the pair of one-acters, I rashly applied the phrase 'comedy of menace' to Pinter's writing.  I now take it back" ("There's Music" 130, as qtd. in Merritt 225–26).

After Wardle's retraction of ''comedy of menace'' as he had applied it to Pinter's writing, Pinter himself also occasionally disavowed it and questioned its relevance to his work (as he  also did with his own offhand but apt statement that his plays are about "the weasel under the cocktail cabinet").  For example, in December 1971, in his interview with Pinter about ''[[Old Times]]'', [[Mel Gussow]] recalled that "After ''[[The Homecoming]]'' [Pinter] said that [he] 'couldn't any longer stay in the room with this bunch of people who opened doors and came in and went out.  ''[[Landscape]]'' and ''[[Silence]]'' [the two short poetic memory plays that were written between ''The Homecoming'' and ''Old Times''] are in a very different form.  There isn't any menace at all.'&amp;nbsp;"  Later, when Gussow asked Pinter to expand on his view that he had "tired" of "menace", Pinter added: "when I said that I was tired of menace, I was using a word that I didn't coin.  I never thought of menace myself.  It was called 'comedy of menace' quite a long time ago [1958].  I never stuck categories on myself, or on any of us [playwrights].  But if what I understand the word menace to mean is certain elements that I have employed in the past in the shape of a particular play, then I don't think it's worthy of much more exploration" (Gussow, ''Conversations with Pinter'' 18, 24).

Despite Wardle's retraction of ''comedy of menace'' (and Pinter's later qualifications), ''Comedy of menace'' and ''comedies of menace'' caught on and have been prevalent since the late 1950s in advertisements and in critical accounts, notices, and reviews to describe Pinter's early plays and some of his later work as well.&lt;ref name=Merritt/&gt;  As Merritt points out, among other examples of critics' usage of this and similar categories of Pinter's work, after Gussow's 1971 "conversation" with Pinter, "Though he echoes Wardle's concept, Gussow seems to avoid using ''comedy of menace'' when reviewing the CSC Repertory Theatre's 1988 production of ''The Birthday Party''.  While still emphasizing Pinter's 'terrors' and the 'shiver beneath the laughter,' Gussow describes the play as 'a play of intrigue, with an underlying motif of betrayal' … [and] [Bernard F.] Dukore calls the play 'a comedy (of menace or otherwise)' … (Merritt 10).

&lt;!--See Wikified links to articles on the plays for further details and interpretations of their elements of comedy and menace and critical references.--&gt;
;''The Birthday Party'' (1958)

In discussing the first production of Pinter's first full-length play, ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'' (1958), which followed his first play, ''[[The Room (play)|The Room]]'' (1957), his authorised official biographer [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] points out that Wardle "once excellently" described its setting (paraphrasing Wardle), as "a banal living-room [which] opens up to the horrors of modern history" (Billington 86).

;''The Dumb Waiter'' (1960)

In his second one-act play, ''[[The Dumb Waiter]]'' (1960), as accentuated through the 2008 film by [[Martin McDonagh]] closely resembling and markedly influenced by it, ''[[In Bruges]]'', "Pinter conveys the idea of political terror through the staccato rhythms of [[music hall|music-hall]] cross-talk and the urban thriller: [[Hackney Empire]] cross-fertilises with [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Killers (Hemingway short story)|The Killers]]'' [1927]" (Billington 90), one of Pinter's own acknowledged early influences, along with [[Franz Kafka]] (348–49); Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists, such as [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Webster]], and [[Cyril Tourneur]], whose work his schoolmaster Joseph Brearley had introduced to him; [[Samuel Beckett]] (mostly his novels [43]); and black-and-white American movies of the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref name=WardleinMerritt&gt;See Wardle, "Comedy of Menace" 33, as qtd. in Merritt 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

"A near-perfect play about the testiness of a collapsing partnership and the divide-and-rule tactics of authority," according to Billington, ''The Dumb Waiter'' focuses on two characters, Gus and Ben; Gus is "the man who questions the agreed system and who is ultimately destroyed by his quest for meaning"; Ben, "the man who blindly obeys orders and thereby places himself at risk.  (If the system can arbitrarily dispose of his partner, why not of him?)" (92).  As Pinter's ''The Dumb Waiter'' has been categorised as a "comedy of menace," so may be  McDonagh's ''In Bruges'', as it closely resembles it; yet, despite the comedy and the sense of threat growing out of the menace, these works of Pinter and McDonagh are, in Pinter's words to Billington, also "doing something which can be described as political" (92).  At the same time, [Pinter] had – and still [in 1996 through to the time of his death in 2008] has – an acute sense of the fragility of earthly happiness and of the terrors that haunt us even from infancy" (92).

The "punning title" of ''The Dumb Waiter'', Billington observes, "carries several layers of meaning": "It obviously refers to the antique serving-hatch that despatches [sic] ever more grotesque orders for food to these bickering gunmen"—the [[dumbwaiter (elevator)|dumbwaiter]]; "But it also applies to Gus, who, troubled by the nature of the mission [their next job as hitmen] to realise he is its chosen target; or, indeed to Ben, who, by his total obedience to a higher authority that forces him to eliminate his partner, exposes his own vulnerability" (89).  As Gus "dumbly" awaits his fate, he may be a subservient partner who awaits orders from the "senior partner" Ben, but Ben too is subservient to [[The powers that be (phrase)|The Powers That Be]], a contemporary variation on [[Deus ex machina]], manipulating both the mechanical dumbwaiter and them through its increasingly extravagant and thus comically inconvenient "orders" for increasingly exotic dishes, unnerving both of them.

Billington adds:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This being Pinter, the play has a metaphorical openness.  You can interpret it as an [[Theatre of the absurd|Absurdist comedy]] – a kind of ''[[Waiting for Godot|Godot]]'' in [[Birmingham]] – about two men passing the time in a universe without meaning or purpose.  You can see it as a cry of protest against a whimsically cruel God who treats man as His plaything – even the twelve matches that are mysteriously pushed under the door have been invested with religious significance [by critics].  But it makes much more sense if seen as a play about the dynamics of power and the nature of partnership.  Ben and Gus are both victims of some unseen authority ''and'' a surrogate married couple quarrelling, testing, [[talking past each other]] and raking over old times. (90)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The comedy in this "comedy of menace" often derives from such arguments between Gus and Ben, especially the one that occurs when "Ben tells Gus to go and light the kettle," a "semantic nit-picking that is a standard part of music-hall comedy": "All the great stage and film double acts – [[Jimmy Jewel|Jewel]] and [[Ben Warriss|Warriss]], [[Abbott and Costello]] – fall into this kind of verbal worrying in which the bullying 'male' straight man issues instructions which are questioned by the more literal-minded 'female' partner" —
&lt;blockquote&gt;
GUS: Light what?&lt;br&gt;
BEN: The kettle.&lt;br&gt;
GUS: You mean the gas.&lt;br&gt;
BEN: Who does?&lt;br&gt;
GUS: You do.&lt;br&gt;
BEN: (''his eyes narrowing''): What do you mean, I mean the gas?&lt;br&gt;
GUS: Well, that's what you mean, don't you? The gas.&lt;br&gt;
BEN: (''Powerfully''): If I say go and light the kettle I mean go and light the kettle.&lt;br&gt;
GUS: How can you light a kettle?&lt;br&gt;
BEN: It's a figure of speech! Light the kettle.  It's a figure of speech! (Qtd. in Billington 90–91)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Billington observes further,
&lt;blockquote&gt;This kind of comic pedantry has precise echoes of the great [[Sid Field]] – ironically [since the city is the setting of this play] a Birmingham comic – who had a famous sketch in which he played a virgin of the greens being hectored by [[Jerry Desmonde]]'s golf pro who would cry, in exasperation, 'When I say "Slowly Back" I don't mean "Slowly Back", I mean "Slowly Back."&amp;nbsp;' At another moment, the bullying pro would tell the hapless Sid to get behind the ball and he would vainly protest 'But it's behind all round it'. But, where in a music-hall sketch this kind of semantic by-play was its own justification, in Pinter it becomes a crucial part of the power-structure.  … The pay-off comes when Gus, having dogmatically insisted that the accurate phrase is 'put on the kettle', suddenly finds an irritated Ben adopting the right usage. (91)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Everything" in ''The Dumb Waiter'', Billington observes, "contributes towards a necessary end"; for, "the image, as Pete says in [Pinter's only novel] ''[[The Dwarfs (novel)|The Dwarfs]]'', stands in exact correspondence and relation to the idea" (91).  In this example, the central image and central metaphor, the dumbwaiter, while "despatching ever more unlikely orders," serves as "both a visual gag and a metaphor for manipulative authority" (91), and therein lies its menace.  When Ben instructs Gus verbally, while practicing their "routine" for killing their next victim, he leaves out the most important line, which instructs Gus to "take out" his "gun" (Pinter, ''The Dumb Waiter'' 114–15):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"BEN ''frowns and presses his forehead''.&lt;br&gt;
GUS.  You've missed something out.&lt;br&gt;
BEN.  I know.  What?&lt;br&gt;
GUS.  I haven't taken my gun out, according to you.&lt;br&gt;
BEN.  You take your gun out—&lt;br&gt;
GUS.  After I've closed the door.&lt;br&gt;
BEN.  After you've closed the door.&lt;br&gt;
GUS.  You've never missed that out before, you know that?&lt;br&gt;
(Pinter, ''The Dumb Waiter'' 116)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The crucial significance of the omission becomes clear only at the very end of the play, when "Gus enters through the door stage-right – the one marked for the intended victim – stripped of his gun and holster"; it becomes clear that ''he'' is going to be "Ben's target" (Billington 92), as Ben's "''revolver [is] levelled at the door''", though the play ends ''before'' Ben fires any shot (Pinter, ''The Dumb Waiter'' 121).

;''The Caretaker'' (1960)

In an entry on Pinter for the 1969 edition of ''[[The Encyclopedia of World Drama]]'' cited by Merritt, Wardle repeats and updates some of his first perspective on ''comedy of menace'' as he had applied it initially to Pinter's writing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Early in his writing career Pinter admitted to three influences: [[Franz Kafka]], American gangster films, and [[Samuel Beckett]]. . . . At that time his plays, more than those of any other plawright's {{sic}}, were responsible for the newly coined term 'comedy of menace.'  This phrase certainly makes sense when applied to ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'' . . . or to ''[[The Dumb Waiter]]''. . . . But 'menace' is hardly the word for ''[[The Caretaker]]'', and still less for subsequent plays in which Pinter increasingly exchanged his derelict settings and down-and-out characters for environments of moneyed elegance (657–58).  (Qtd. in Merritt 240)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite those more-recent caveats regarding applying the phrase that he himself initially coined for Pinter's writing to ''The Caretaker''—only the second of Pinter's full-length plays produced by then and the one that launched his career as a successful playwright in 1960 (Merritt 9, 226) —and to Pinter's later plays, scenes in both acts of ''The Caretaker'' in which Mick confronts an unsuspecting Davies and scares him almost speechless (Pinter, ''The Caretaker'' 129, 146) also epitomise how comedy and menace still co-exist in Pinter's text and on Pinter's stage.

The comic aspects of this play multiply, reaching a crescendo in Mick's monologue in Act Two describing his "deepest wishes" for decorating the attic room (161, 173) and falling with Davies, a tramp taken in out of the cold by his brother, suggesting that "if" he can "just get down to Sidcup" to get his "papers" and "sort" himself "out" (113–16, 164), his refrain and excuse for everything (153, 175–79), he might just be able to accomplish Mick's hyperbolic pipe dream and "decorate the attic room out for [Mick]" (164), leading Mick to accuse Davies of misrepresenting himself as "an experienced first-class professional interior and exterior decorator" (172–74), an absurd conclusion, given the tangible evidence of the down-and-out Davies before Mick (and the audience).

Pinter's friend the late film and stage director [[David Jones (director)|David Jones]], who directed the play for the [[Roundabout Theatre]], in [[New York City]], in 2003 (having previously directed Pinter's 1983 film of ''[[Betrayal (1983 film)|Betrayal]]'', as well as other works by or featuring him), reminds his audience that Pinter himself said, in a widely quoted statement, that ''The Caretaker'' is only "funny, up to a point" and that "beyond that point" is why he wrote it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is always mischief lurking in the darkest corners. The world of The Caretaker is a bleak one, its characters damaged and lonely. But they are all going to survive. And in their dance to that end they show a frenetic vitality and a wry sense of the ridiculous that balance heartache and laughter. Funny, but not too funny. As Pinter wrote, back in 1960: "As far as I am concerned The Caretaker IS funny, up to a point. Beyond that point, it ceases to be funny, and it is because of that point that I wrote it." (Jones)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
"Beyond the point" of the comedy (the "funny") lies the scary territory that threatens one's very existence (Billington 92), which Wardle and others commonly have "labeled" or "pigeonholed" (depending on one's perspective) as "menace" (Merritt 9–10).

;Pinter's later plays

Though "comedy of menace" is generally applied to Pinter's early work of the late 1950s through the middle of the 1960s, including ''[[The Collection (play)|The Collection]]'' (1961), ''[[The Lover (play)|The Lover]]'' (1963), ''[[Tea Party (play)|Tea Party]]'' (1965, 1968), and ''[[The Homecoming]]'' (1965), even Pinter's late plays, like ''[[Ashes to Ashes (play)|Ashes to Ashes]]'' (1996) and ''[[Celebration (play)|Celebration]]'' (2000), his last two full-length stage plays, exhibit his characteristic amalgam of the comic and the menacing, a sense of threat or impending doom; there is less comedy and more menace in ''Ashes to Ashes'', in which heavy echoes of the [[Holocaust]] predominate; a more comedy than menace in ''Celebration'', where heightened comic dialogue outweighs the frightening undercurrents of terror, the terrifying, or the terrible.

;''Celebration'' (2000)

While reviewers and other audience members describe ''[[Celebration (play)|Celebration]]'' as hilarious ("one of Pinter's funniest plays", according to Billington [404]), the nature of the relationships of two sets of diners (three couples) having dinner in an upscale restaurant (which some critics assume that Pinter modeled on [[The Ivy]], in London's [[West End (London)|West End]]) – "this is the best and most expensive restaurant in the whole of Europe" (Pinter, ''Celebration'' 364) – remains characteristically ambiguous; Billington describes one set of couples as "a strangely rootless bunch with a depleted sense of family" (405).

One set (the two couples seated at Table One) consists of brothers Lambert and Matt and their wives, Prue and Julie, who are sisters; the second set of diners (the couple seated at Table Two) consists of a banker and his young wife, Suki, who comically turns out to have had an affair with Lambert when she was 18 (Billington 104).

As the "''maître d'hôtel''" emits platitudes geared to elevate the nouveaux riches in their own imagined esteem ("I believe the concept of this restaurant rests in that [[public house]] of my childhood" [Pinter, ''Celebration'' 371]), the "''maîtress d'hôtel''" appears to dwell on a peculiar past family and sex life (373–74), while the Waiter engages in "interjections" spinning fantasied impossible memories of a grandfather who knew writers, other artists, and various other public figures of multiple decades and geographical locations too far apart to have been experienced personally in one man's lifetime (367, 375).

Lambert and Matt reveal themselves to be rather uncouth bullies ("[[Teddy boys]]", according to some London reviews)—
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Lambert's [[mobile phone]] rings''.&lt;br&gt;
LAMBERT  Who the fuck's this?&lt;br&gt;
''He switches it on''.&lt;br&gt;
LAMBERT (''cont''.)  Yes? What? (''He listens briefly''.)  I said no calls! It's my fucking wedding anniversary!&lt;br&gt;
''He switches it off''.&lt;br&gt;
LAMBERT (''cont''.) Cunt.&lt;br&gt;  (Pinter, ''Celebration'' 364)—&lt;/blockquote&gt;
who describe themselves as "consultants … Strategy consultants. … It means we don't carry guns.  … We don't have to! … We're peaceful strategy consultants. … Worldwide.  Keeping the peace (379). ''Strategy consultant'' could be a [[euphemism|euphemistic]] catchall for  warmonger, manager of [[terrorism]], purveyor of [[counter-terrorism]], or orderer of [[covert operations]].

As the banker Russell interprets their explanation, ''peaceful strategy consultants'' seems vaguely menacing: "We need more people like you.  Taking responsibility.  Taking charge.  Keeping the peace.  Enforcing the peace.  Enforcing peace.  We need more like you" (379).  This speech stressing "force" (in the repetitions of ''Enforcing'') occurs after Russell has already revealed his own ilk:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Look at me.  I'm basically a totally disordered personality; some people would describe me as a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]].  (''to Suki'') Am I right?&lt;br&gt;
SUKI  Yes.&lt;br&gt;
RUSSELL  But when I'm sitting in this restaurant I suddenly find I have no psychopathic tendencies at all.  I don't feel like killing everyone in sight, I don't feel like putting a bomb under everyone's arse.  I feel something quite different, I have a sense of equilibrium, of harmony, I love my fellow diners.  Now this is very unusual for me.  Normally I feel—as I've just said—absoute malice and hatred towards everyone within spitting distance—but here I feel love. How do you explain it?&lt;br&gt;
SUKI  It's the ambience. (370–71)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lambert and Matt are distantly reminiscent of Gus and Ben from ''The Dumb Waiter''; but distinctly less polite while living much higher on the hog.  One imagines such characters 
"strategically" plotting the "peaceful" rendition of others without any qualms while sipping [[Perrier]] and simultaneously planning their next wedding-anniversary dinner celebration (perhaps with a different set of wives) on their [[Mobile phone|mobiles]].

As the Waiter says in his apparently penultimate "interjection", in which one might detect intimations of mortality:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
My grandfather introduced me to the mystery of life and I'm still in the middle of it.  I can't find the door to get out.  My grandfather got out of it.  He left it behind him and he didn't look back.&lt;br&gt;
He got that absolutely right.&lt;br&gt;
And I'd like to make one further interjection.&lt;br&gt;
''He stands still''.&lt;br /&gt;
''Slow fade''.&lt;br&gt;
(385)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;"Apart From That" (Sketch) (2006)

Pinter mocks [[mobile phone]]s comically in an ostensibly-trivial wireless conversation, while still suggesting a residual bit of menace in the unsaid, developed as his last revue sketch ''[[Apart From That (sketch)|Apart From That]]'' (2006).  As Billington observes, this dramatic sketch inspired by Pinter's strong aversion to mobile phones is "very funny", but "as two people trade banalities over their mobile phones[,] there is a hint of something ominous and unspoken behind the clichéd chat" (429), as illustrated in the following excerpt:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Two people on mobile phones''.&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
How are you?&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
Very well.  And you? Are you well?&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
I'm terribly well.  How about you?&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
Really well.  I'm really well.&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
I'm so glad.&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
Apart from ... oh you know ...&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
I know.&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
Apart from ... oh you know ...&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
I do know. But apart from that ...?&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
How about you?&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
Oh you know ... all things considered ...&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
I know.  But apart from that ...?&lt;br /&gt;
''Silence''.&lt;br /&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
Sorry. I've lost you.&lt;br&gt;
[....]

The '''Cusco School''' ('''''Escuela Cuzqueña''''') or '''Cuzco School''', was a [[Roman Catholic]] artistic tradition based in [[Cusco]], [[Peru]] (the former capital of the [[Inca Empire]]) during the Colonial period, in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. It was not limited to Cuzco only, but spread to other cities in the [[Andes]], as well as to present day [[Ecuador]] and [[Bolivia]].&lt;ref name="museu"/&gt;

There are high amount of Cusco School's paintings preserved, currently most of them are located at Cusco, but also currently there are in the rest of Peru and in museums of Brazil, England and United States.

==History==
The tradition originated after the 1534 [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire]],&lt;ref name="museu"&gt;[http://www.museuhistoriconacional.com.br/ingles/mh-e-104.htm "The 'Cusquenha' Art."] National Historical Museum of Brazil.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is considered the first artistic center that systematically taught European artistic techniques in the [[Americas]].&lt;ref name="museu"/&gt; The [[Spain|Spanish]] contribution, and in general [[Europe|European]], to the Cusco School of painting, is given from very early time, when the [[construction]] of the [[Cathedral of Cusco]] begins. However, It is the arrival of the [[Italy|Italian]] painter [[Bernardo Bitti]] in 1583, the one that marks a first moment of the development of Cuzqueño art. This [[Company of Jesus|Jesuit]] introduces in Cusco one of the fashionable currents in [[Europe]] of then, the [[Mannerism]], whose main characteristics were the treatment of figures in a somewhat elongated way, with the [[light]] focused on them.

During his two stays in Cusco, Bitti was commissioned to make the main altarpiece of the church of his Order, replaced by another after the [[earthquake]], and painted some masterpieces, as ''The Coronation of the Virgin'', currently in the museum of the [[Templo de la Merced, Cusco|church of La Merced]], and the ''Virgen del pajarito'', in the cathedral.

[[File:Cuzqueña3.jpg|thumb|250px|''The Annunciation of the Virgin'', painting by [[Luis de Riaño]] of 1632. Disciple in [[Lima]] of the [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Angelino Medoro]], Riaño was installed at [[Cusco]] to 1630, where his techniques and themes were very influential. Painting located at Museo Pedro de Osma de Barranco, Lima]]
Another of the great exponents of Cusqueño mannerism is the painter [[Luis de Riaño]], born in [[Lima]] and a disciple of Italian [[Angelino Medoro]]. In the words of the Bolivians historians José de Mesa and [[Teresa Gisbert Carbonell|Teresa Gisbert]], authors of the most complete history of Cuzqueño Art, Riaño lords in the local artistic environment between 1618 and 1640, leaving, among other works, the murals of the church of [[Andahuaylillas]]. Also it emphasizes in these first decades of 17th century, the muralist [[Diego Cusihuamán (painter)|Diego Cusihuamán]], with works in the churches of [[Chinchero District|Chinchero]] and [[Urcos District|Urcos]].

The [[Baroque]] in the Cuzqueña painting is mainly the result of the influence of the [[Tenebrism|Tenebrism trending]] through the work of [[Francisco de Zurbarán]] and of the use as a source of inspiration of the engravings with [[Flanders|Felmish]] art from [[Antwerp]]. [[Marcos Ribera]], born in [[Cusco]] in 1830, is the maximum exponent of this tendency. Five of apostles of him can be seen in the [[Iglesia de San Pedro, Cusco|church of San Pedro]], two in the altarpiece and another in a side reredos. The [[Monastery of Santa Catalina de Siena, Arequipa|monastery of Santa Catalina of Arequipa]] keeps ''La Piedad'', and that of St. Francis, some of the canvases that illustrate the life of the founder of the Order, belonging to various authors.

The increasing activity of Indian-Quechua and mestizo painters towards the end of 17th century, makes the term of Cusco School conform more strictly to this artistic production. This painting is "Cuzqueña", otherwise, not only because it comes from the hands of local artists, but mainly because it moves away from the influence of the predominant trending in European art and follows its own path.

This new Cuzqueño art is characterized, in the thematic, by the interest in [[Costumbrismo|Costumbrista]] subjects as, for example, the procession of Corpus Christi, and by the presence, for the first time, of [[Andes|Andean]] [[flora]] and [[fauna]]. A series of portraits of Indian caciques and [[genealogical]] and [[heraldic]] paintings also appear. As for the technical treatment, there is a misunderstanding of the perspective added to a fragmentation of the space in several concurrent spaces or compartmentalized scenes. New chromatic solutions, with a predilection for the intense colors, they are another typical feature of the nascent pictorial style.

An event occurred at the end-17th century, was decisive for the direction taken by Cuzqueña painting. In 1688, after permanent conflicts, there is a rupture in the corporation  of painters that ends with the removal of the Indian-Quechua and Mestizo painters due, according to them, to the exploitation they were subjected by their Spanish colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Fane, pp. 39-40&lt;/ref&gt; From this moment, free of the impositions of the corporation, the Indian and mestizo artists are guided by their own sensibility and transfer to the canvas their mentality and their way of conceiving the world.

The most famous series of the Cuzco School is undoubtedly that of the sixteen paintings of the Corpus Christi series, which originally were in the [[Iglesia de Santa Ana, Cusco|church of Santa Ana]] and are now in the [[Museum of Religious Art of the Archbishopric of Cusco]], except for three that are in [[Chile]]. From an anonymous painter of the late-17th century (some researchers attribute them to the workshops of Diego Quispe Tito and Pumacallao), these canvases are considered true masterpieces because of the richness of their color, the quality of the drawing and how well they achieved the portraits of the main characters of each scene. The series has enormous historical and [[ethnographic]] value, because it shows in detail the various social strata of Colonial Cusco, as well as a large number of other elements of a ferstival that already then it was central in the life of the city.

The most original and important Indian painter is [[Diego Quispe Tito]], born in the parish of [[San Sebastián District, Cusco|San Sebastián]], near to Cusco, in 1611 and active almost until end the century. It is in the work of Diego Quispe Tito that some of the characteristics of Cuzqueña painting will be prefigured, as a certain freedom in the handling of perspective, a previously unknown role of the landscape and the abundance of birds in the leafy trees that are part of the same. The motive of the birds, especially the Amazon forest's parrot, is interpreted by some researchers as it refers to the Inca nobility.

The most valuable part of Quispe Tito's work is located in the church of his native town, [[San Sebastián, Cusco|San Sebastián]]. Highlights the series of twelve compositions on the life of St. John the Baptist, in the main nave of the church. Of great mastery are also the two enormous canvases dedicated to [[Saint Sebastian]], that of the ''asaetamiento'' and that of the death of the saint. Famous is, finally, the series of the [[Zodiac]] that the artist paints for the Cathedral of Cuzco towards 1680.

[[File:The Virgin of Bethlehem in the city of Cusco. 17th century.jpg|thumb|260px|The Virgin of Bethlehem of the city of Cusco, 17th century. Currently painting located in Cusco]]
Another outstanding painter of Cusco School is [[Basilio Santa Cruz Pumacallao]], of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] ancestry like Quispe Tito, but unlike him, much more attached to the canons of Western painting within the Baroque current. Active in the second half of the 17th century, Santa Cruz leaves the best of his work in the Cathedral of Cusco, as he is commissioned to decorate the [[Load-bearing wall|walls]] on the side of the choir and the arms of the transept. In the picture of the ''Virgin of Bethelem'', located in the choir, there is a portrait of the bishop and patron [[Manuel de Mollinedo y Angulo]] that help quite to the developing of the Cusco Painting School and the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://revistas.pucp.edu.pe/index.php/boletinira/article/viewFile/9553/9957|title=LOS MOLLINEDO y EL ARTE DEL CUZCO COLONIAL|author=Horacio Villanueva Urteaga |magazine=Portal de Revistas PUCP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such is the fame reached by the Cusqueña painting of the 17th century, which during the following century produces a singular phenomenon that, curiously, left its mark not only in art but in the local [[economy]]. We refer to the industrial workshops that make canvases in large quantities by order of merchants who sell these works in cities such as [[Trujillo, Peru| Trujillo]], [[Ayacucho]], [[Arequipa]] and [[Lima]], or even in much more distant places, in the current [[Argentina]], [[Chile]] and [[Bolivia]]. The painter [[Mauricio García (painter)|Mauricio García]], active towards the mid-18th century, signs, for example, a contract to deliver about five hundred canvases in seven months. Of course it was what was known as "ordinary" painting to differentiate it from the painting of fine ''brocateado'', with a much more elaborate and colorful design.

The most important artist of the 18th century is [[Marcos Zapata]]. His pictorial output, which spans more than 200 paintings, ranges between 1748 and 1764. The best are the fifty large canvases that cover the high arches of the Cathedral of Cusco and that are characterized by the abundance of flora and fauna as a decorative element.

==Authors==
The Cuzqueña paintings were a form of [[Christian art|religious art]] whose main purpose was didactic.&lt;ref name="museu"/&gt; The Spanish, who aimed to convert the Incas to Catholicism, sent a group of religious artists to Cusco.&lt;ref name="museu"/&gt; These artists formed a school for [[Quechua people]] and mestizos, teaching them [[drawing]] and [[oil painting]].&lt;ref name="museu"/&gt; The designation "Cusqueña," however, is not limited to the city of Cusco or to indigenous artists, as Spanish creoles participated in the tradition as well.

A major patron of the Cuzco artists was Bishop Manuel de Mollinedo y Angulo, who collected European art and made his collection available to Peruvian artists. He promoted and financially assisted such Cusqueña artists such as [[Basilio Santa Cruz Pumacallao]], Antonio Sinchi Roca Inka, and Marcos Rivera.&lt;ref name=f38&gt;Fane, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Cusco School paintings were made by mestizos, Quecha-Indians and Whites-creoles.

==Style==
The defining characteristics of the Cusqueña style are believed to have originated in the art of Quechua painter [[Diego Quispe Tito]].&lt;ref&gt;Bethell, p. 742&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bakewell, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

Cusqueña paintings are characterized by their use of exclusively religious subjects, their lack of [[perspective (art)|perspective]], and the predominance of red, yellow and earth colors.&lt;ref name="museu"/&gt; They are also remarkable for their lavish use of gold leaf,&lt;ref&gt;Fane, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; especially with images of the [[Virgin Mary]]. Though the Cusqueño painters were familiar with prints of [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]], [[Flemish art|Flemish]] and [[Italian Renaissance art]], their works were freer than those of their European tutors; they used bright colors and distorted, dramatic images. They often adapted the topics to depict their native flora and fauna as a backdrop in their works.&lt;ref name="museu"/&gt;

[[Ángel arcabucero|Warrior angels]] became a popular motif in Cusqueña paintings.&lt;ref name=f38/&gt;

Most Cusqueña paintings were created anonymously because of Pre-Columbian traditions that define art as communal.&lt;ref name="museu"/&gt; An exception is one of the last members of the Cuzco School, [[Marcos Zapata]] (c. 1710-1773). Other known artists of the Cuzco School include Diego Cusihuamán, Gregorio Gamarra, [[Basilio Santa Cruz Pumacallao]] (1635-1710), and [[Antonio Sinchi Roca Inka]]. Related to the school is the [[Master of Calamarca]], in 18th century, Bolivia.

==Collections==
The largest collection of paintings from the Cuzco school is in the [[Cathedral of Santo Domingo (Cusco)]]. The Lima Art Museum and the Inca Museum also house important collections.

A large number of works were destroyed in the 18th century so there is a limited supply of Cuzco school paintings. In recent years there has been a significant increase in demand from both Latin American art collectors and certain museums for paintings from the Cusco school period. In 2010, the American government [[Art repatriation|repatriated]] two Cusco and Lima style paintings to Peru that had been illegally brought into the United States in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Restoring Cultural Heritage: 18th-Century Paintings Returned to Peru|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2010/april/peru_040810/restoring-cultural-heritage-18th-century-paintings-returned-to-peru|accessdate=8 October 2013|newspaper=FBI "Stories"|date=04/08/10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern interpretations==
There is a known project to national level called "Vírgenes Urbanas" in which the paintings of the Cusco school are recreated replacing the bodies by Indigenous people, as well as Indigenous angels, Virgin Marys and saints like Rose of Lima with new Indigenous faces in order to represent the current Peruvian population. In addition to the paintings, they also do Indigenous photo montages on recreations of the paintings. According to them, the Cusco School is a symbol of the power of the colonizer "representing images with Caucasian features, imposing ideas, religion and Western stereotypes" and the project re-poses them with new signs that refer directly to the descendants of the former victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.virgenesurbanas.com/presentacin/|title=VIRGENES URBANAS}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

These new paintings are also exhibited in many museums throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://virgenesurbanas.wordpress.com/|website=virgenesurbanas.wordpress.com|title=Vírgenes Urbanas.

The '''Dacian bracelets''' are [[bracelets]] associated with the ancient people known as the [[Dacians]], a distinct branch of the [[Thracians]]. These bracelets were used as ornaments, [[currency]], high rank insignia and [[votive offerings]]&lt;ref&gt;&lt;ol class="references"&gt;

* For the North Thracians see McHenry Encyclopædia Britannica (1993) p.602
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Their ornamentations consist of many elaborate regionally distinct styles.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=212}} Bracelets of various types were worn by Dacians, but the most characteristic piece of their jewelry was the large multi-spiral bracelets; engraved with [[palmette]]s towards the ends and terminating in the shape of an animal head, usually that of a snake.{{sfn|Popescu|1971|p=45}}

== Dacians background ==
[[File:Muzeuldeistorienaturalavienaaurdacic7.JPG|thumb|right|Spiral motif with gold bracelet found in Romania (dated to Bronze IV = Hallstatt A){{sfn|Pârvan|Vulpe|1928|p=57}}) repository [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]]{{sfn|Burda |1979|p=17}}]]

The [[Dacians]] lived in a very large territory, stretching from the [[Balkans]] to the northern [[Carpathians]] and from the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Nistru|Tyras River (Nistru)]] to the [[Tisza|Tisa]] plain, and at times as far as the [[Middle Danube]].{{sfn|MacKenzie|1986|p=25}}

[[Dacian civilization]] went through several stages of development, from the [[Thracian]] stage in the [[Bronze Age]] to the [[Geto-Dacian stage]] in the classical period that lasted from the 1st century BC to the 1st century AD.{{sfn|Giurescu|Nestorescu|1981|p=47}} The Thracian stage is associated with the emergence of Thracian populations from the fusion of the local [[Eneolithic|Chalcolithic]] stock with the incoming peoples of the transitional Indo-Europeanization Period.{{sfn|Dumitrescu|Boardman|1982|p=53}}{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=52}} By the time of [[Bronze Age]], and during the transitional period to the [[Iron Age]], the cultures of this Carpathian area may be attributed to proto-Thracian and even Thracian populations—ancestors of the peoples known to Herodotus as the Agathyrsae and the Getae, and to the Romans as the [[Dacians]] (by Iron Age II).{{sfn|Cunliffe|1987|p=59}}{{sfn|Dumitrescu|1972|p=259}} The culture of these nuclear groups were typified by military aristocracies.{{sfn|McHenry|Encyclopædia Britannica | 1993|p=602}}

In these early times the most specific motifs of the bracelets are the spiral and the horn, used to provide the warrior with both physical and deistic protection.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=57}}
* The ''spiral motif'' (i.e. bracelets from [[Sacosu Mare]], [[Şagu|Firighiaz (now Firiteaz)]], [[Săcueni]]) is associated with solar cults.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=53}}{{sfn|Burda|1979|p=17}} It might have been an inheritance of the local Chalcolithic culture,{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=57}} or an accentuated [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] influence to the north of the Danube.{{sfn|Dumitrescu|1972|p=258}}
* The ''horn motifs'' (i.e. bracelets from [[Pipea]], [[Şona|Biia (Şona)]], [[Şeica Mare|Boarta (Şeica Mare)]]) might have been brought by the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|intrusive stockbreeders (Proto-Indo-Europeans)]].{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=57}}

The 5th century BC is associated with the Dacian stage of art{{sfn|Megaw| 1970| p=32}}{{sfn|Sandars| 1976|p=51}} and it is the time of the [[La Tène]] period (Iron Age II) when Dacian culture flourished, especially in Transylvanian citadels.{{sfn|McKendrick|1975|p=19}} The Dacian art of Iron Age II has all the characteristics of a mixed style, with its roots in the [[Hallstatt culture]] (1200–500 BC).{{sfn|Halbertsma|1994|p=26}}{{sfn|McKendrick|1975|p=19}} It is characterized by an accentuated geometry, a curvilinear style and plant-based motifs.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=212}} At this time, besides their older local types, Dacians made all kind of bracelets that were common in the [[Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Glodariu|1997|p=25}} But, there was a constant preference of Dacians for decorating the silver spiral bracelets with animals [[protome]] such as snakes and wolves.{{sfn|Sîrbu|Florea|2000|p=69}}

The period of time between the 2nd century BC and 1st century AD is termed "Classic Dacian".{{sfn|Oltean|2007|p=63}} At this time the Dacians developed the art of silverworking, and a style which may be described specifically as the Dacian style. It consists of older traditional local elements, dating back to Iron Age I, but also of elements of Celtic, Scythian, Thracian, and especially Greek origins.{{sfn|Popescu|1959|p=22}}{{sfn|Halbertsma|1994|p=26}} The bracelets of this art-form include silver arm rings, with ends in the shape of stylized heads of animals, and heavy spiral-shaped armlets with gilded ends adorned with palm-leaves, and ending in animal-heads.{{sfn|Popescu|1959|p=22}}

The Classic Dacian period ends when parts of the [[Dacian State]] were reduced to a Roman province by the [[Roman Empire]] under [[Trajan]], partly in order to seize its [[gold mines]]. After the [[Second Dacian War]] (105–106 AD) Romans claimed they had looted 165 tonnes of gold and 300 tonnes of silver in a single [[wikt:haul|haul]], as estimated by modern historians. Its existence in only one spot (at Sarmizegethusa), suggests that there was a central control of precious metal circulation.{{sfn|Taylor|1994|p=406}} According to the majority of historians this sort of monopoly of precious metals, and the Roman's forcible collection of Dacian gold objects, explains the scarcity of archaeological discoveries consisting of golden ornaments for the period between the 3rd century BC and the 1st century AD;{{sfn|Seculici|2008|p=67}}{{sfn|Manaila|1976|p=90}} however, the existence of the "[[Treasures of Dacian kings]]" has been confirmed by the latest archaeological finds of large gold spiral-shaped bracelets from [[Sarmizegetusa Regia|Sarmizegetusa]]. It seems that the Romans did not find the entire royal treasure.{{sfn|Constantinescu|Bugoi|Cojocaru|Niculescu|2007|p=32}}{{sfn|Glodariu|Sima|Iaroslavschi|Gheorghiu|2008|p=146}}

== Bracelets in the transition period North Thracian and proto-Dacian ==
===Types of bracelets in the Bronze Age and First Iron Age===
Numerous bracelets were made of bronze and gold and many of them have been found in Transylvania, near the sources of the ores used in their manufacture.{{sfn|Coles|Harding|1979 |p=94}} They include the following types:
* unequally spiraled armlet made of bronze, worn on the forearm that is also called "arm guard" i.e. those found at Apa ([[Satu Mare County]]){{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=68}}
* equally spiraled bracelet, used frequently in the early Hallstatt i.e. [[Pecica]].{{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=68}}
* open bracelet with widened ends, made of double gold wire i.e. [[Ostrovu Mare|Ostrovu Mare (Gogoşu)]].{{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=68}}
* bracelet with spiralled or volutes endings i.e. [[Şagu|Firighiaz/Firiteaz]],{{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=68}} [[Darova|Sacoșu Mare]].{{sfn|Leahu|2004|p=1}}
* open bracelet decorated with incisions, with each end coiled in double opposed volutes i.e. [[Darova|Sacoșu Mare]] and Hodiş ([[Bihor County]]).{{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=68}}
* overlapped ends, rhombic cross section i.e. [[Darova|Sacoșu Mare]] and [[Şmig]].{{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=68}} The treasures from Şmig [[Sibiu County]] and from [[Boroşneu Mare|Ţufalău (Boroşneu Mare)]] contained also raw gold, thus suggesting the bracelets had been locally made.{{sfn| Popescu | 1956|p= 227}}

Some bronze bracelet types of the Bronze Age (i.e. incised solid bracelets) continue throughout all the Late Bronze Age and Hallstatt phases.{{sfn|Coles|Harding|1979|p=409}}

==== Various bracelets ====
[[File:Dacian Gold Bracelet at the National Museum of Romanian History 2011 - 3.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Hinova]]'s gold bracelet, Bronze Age{{sfn|Leahu|2003|p=134}} or early Hallstatt {{sfn|Laszlo|2001|p=350}}]]
Archaeological finds include two gold cylindrical muffs, a characteristic type of the middle and late Bronze Age and widespread throughout Central Europe. Two bronze specimens, both similar to the gold ones, have been discovered at [[Cehal|Cehăluţ]].{{sfn| MacKenzie|1986|p=93}} The open cuff found at [[Hinova]], and dated to the 12th century BC, is one of the largest gold bracelets of the proto-Dacians found to date. It is made of large gold sheet of 580&amp;nbsp;grams (1.27 pounds) in weight and decorated with ten buttons fixed into holes, five on each end.{{sfn| Hagioglu|Gheorghies|2010|p=117}}{{sfn| Leahu|2003|p=1 poz. 134}}

Bracelets from [[Băleni, Galaţi]] (Late Romanian Bronze Age, Noua Culture) are particularly interesting because of their geometric décor, bands of right or oblique lines. They all have a green patina ranging from dark green to dull green, bluish green, bluish gloss.{{sfn|Vauthey|Vauthey|1968|p=345}}

The fragmentary iron bracelet from the cremation cemetery found at [[Bobda]] is among the few unequivocally dated iron objects equivalent to [[Hallstatt|Hallstatt A 1–2]] in this region.{{sfn| Stoia|1989|p=77}}{{sfn| Pleiner|1982|p=168}}

A bracelet with snake-shape endings had been found at the [[Hallstatt Culture|Hallstattian]] necropolis in [[Ferigile]] ([[Vâlcea County]]).{{sfn| Vulpe | 1967|p=73}}

==== Spălnaca (Hopârta) ====
The bracelets from [[Hopârta|Spălnaca (Hopârta)]] are dated to Bronze Age IV (Iron Age I){{sfn|Coles|Harding|1979|p=409}} and have decorations of geometric characters. Although not directly influenced by the Hallstatt styles, the objects from Spalnaca pre-date the later tendencies for geometric surface decoration of chiseled or engraved lines.{{sfn|Pârvan|Vulpe|1928|p=12}} Such discoveries at Spalnaca, Guterita and Dipsa show that bronze craftsmanship still flourished in the North Thracians from the Carpathian-Black Sea and Danube areas at the beginning of the Iron Age.{{sfn|Popescu|1971|p=37}}{{sfn|Petrescu-Dâmbovita|1996|p=597}}

==== Multi-spiral types ====
[[File:ThumbTezaurMNIR.JPG|thumb|right|Multi-spirals type gold bracelet from Hinova, Late Bronze Age{{sfn|Leahu|2003|p=136}} or Early Hallstatt{{sfn|Laszlo|2001|p=350}}]]
This type of Dacian bracelet originated in the Bronze Age.{{sfn| MacKenzie|1986|p=93}} The hoard found in 1980 at [[Hinova]] includes two such bracelets.{{sfn| MacKenzie|1986|p=93}} Multi-spiral types can be dated to the early Hallstatt periodand comprises also open and closed-end bracelets.{{sfn|Laszlo|2001|p=350}} One of the spiral bracelets from Hinova weighed 261.55&amp;nbsp;grams and the other 497.13&amp;nbsp;grams.{{sfn| MacKenzie|1986|p=93}} The former, made of a thinner and narrower gold leaf, had a decoration consisting of two furrows cut along the edges and separated by a median crest.{{sfn| MacKenzie|1986|p=93}} A similar decoration, of a furrow along the median line, decorates a metal bracelet from the deposit found at [[Sânnicolau Român]], dated to the second period of the Bronze Age.{{sfn| MacKenzie|1986|p=93}}

Finds from Dacia include spiral bracelets made of double gold wire, the largest of which weighed nearly a hundred grams. Gold spiral bracelets of this type have been discovered in Transylvania and [[Banat]], spanning a long period which begins with the very late phase of the Bronze Age and ends with the middle Hallstatt. Similar pieces made of bronze were discovered in the deposit of bronze objects at [[Slătioara, Vâlcea|Sacot-Slatioara]].{{sfn| MacKenzie|1986|p=94}}

The multi-spiral bracelet type spans a long period of time that includes all Hallstattian stages.{{sfn|Popa|Berciu|1965|p=63}}

=== Spiral motif ===
[[File:Muzeuldeistorienaturalavienaaurdacic9 quandrangular and crenelated.jpg|thumb|Quadrangular bracelets ([[Sighetu Marmaţiei]]?) The small ones may have been used as currency.{{sfn| Popescu | 1956|p= 212}}]]
The traditional ornamental motifs of bracelets, the meander and the "whirling" spiral (i.e. Oradea, Firiteaz and Sacosul mare), are thought to follow the spread of a cult of the sun, their decorations suggesting the rotation of the sun on the heavenly vault.{{sfn|Dragut |Florea|1984|p=31}} This motif is recognized as one of the parallels between the artifact decorations of this North Thracian group and the ornamentations from the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] [[Shaft Graves]]. It is found in both the [[Aegean Islands|Aegean]] and east-central Europe from the Neolithic onwards.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=53}}

Scholars opinions are divided on the source of these comparable traits. One opinion states that the North Thracian spiral motifs originate from the local [[Eneolithic|Eneolithic (Chalcolithic)]] antecedents rather than from any imported influence.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=57}} There are specific forms widespread in northern Thrace that are unlikely inspired by the Mycenaeans.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=57}} It is also argued that these motifs apparently did not appear in the intervening territory of South Thrace.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=53}} With North Thracians, the spiral motif appears prominently in the form of massive armguard (armlet) terminals, offering physical as well as [[apotropaic]] protection.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=53}} Hoddinott states that the twin spiral terminals, as on the bowl from [[Şona|Biia]], would have been a natural development; either from a local single armlet type or from an [[Unetice culture|Unetice]] spectacle pendant.{{sfn| Hoddinott |1989|p=53}}

The other opinion attributes the spiral motif to a northward spread of Mycenaean influence.{{sfn|Dumitrescu|1972|p=258}} It is argued that the spiral of the Neolithic period disappeared during the transitional period towards the Bronze Age, and even during the Early Bronze Age; therefore, starting from the Middle Bronze Age the spiral would occur because of a Mycenaean sway to the north of the Danube.{{sfn|Dumitrescu|1972|p=258}} These comparable features might have occurred because of commercial relations between the Mycenaeans and Dacians relating to the gold mines of Transylvania.{{sfn|Samsaris|1989|p=169}}

==== Spiral ending types ====
===== Sacoşu Mare =====
Whatever may have been the origin of the spiral motif, the craftsmen of the late [[Bronze Age|Carpatho-Danubian Bronze Age IV]] and [[Hallstatt|Hallstatt A]] had a marked preference for bracelets with a spiral ending, as found at [[Sacosu Mare]].{{sfn| MacKenzie|1986|p=94}} The same décor featuring the coiled disk endings of the single- or double-spiral bracelets is found on contemporary ceramics.{{sfn|Burda|1979|p=17}} There is also a striking resemblance between the gold bracelets from Sacoșu Mare, from [[Şagu|Firighiaz (or Firiteaz)]], and from other locations in Transylvania that suggest a spiritual affinity in the proto-Dacian world.{{sfn|Burda|1979|p=17}}

The hoard from Sacoşu Mare consists of bracelets and jewelry dated to the 13th to 12th centuries BC (Late Bronze Age and Hallstatt I).{{sfn| Leahu|2004|p=1}} The golden bracelets, around 74.15&amp;nbsp;grams (2.6 ounces), have open ends of approximately 6.6&amp;nbsp;cm (2.6&amp;nbsp;inches) in diameter. Some terminate with convex volute ends,{{sfn| Leahu|2004|p=1}} while others have double convex volute ends.{{sfn| Leahu|2011|p=1}} The bracelet's bar is decorated with engraved rows of diamonds flanked by dotted lines.{{sfn| Leahu|2011|p=1}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===== Firighiaz (Firiteaz) =====
The finds from [[Şagu|Firighiaz (Firiteaz)]], [[Arad County]], on left bank of the Lower [[Mureş River]], are representative of the spiral motif bracelets of this period.{{sfn|Pârvan|Vulpe|1928|p=57}} {{sfn|Dumitrescu H|1941|p=141}} The Firiteaz's treasure contains twenty-three bracelets made of gold bar, each weighing 0.2&amp;nbsp;kg (0.44 pounds), and the hoard is housed in the Vienna Museum.{{sfn|Burda |1979|p=17}} Bracelets made of bronze, similar to the Firiteaz ones made of gold, had been found in Transylvanian deposits dated to the Early Iron Age.{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=215}}

The Firighiaz treasure comprises three types of bracelets:
* made of quadrangular cross-section bar; they are tapered at both ends (Type 1, dated to Late Bronze Age){{sfn|Hortensia H|1941|p=136}}
* made of quadrangular cross-section bar; inverted spirals ends (Type 2){{sfn|Dumitrescu H|1941|p=141}}
* made of semi-round cross section bar; these terminate with double volute spirals at each end (Type 3, dated to the 8th to 7th centuries BC){{sfn|Dumitrescu H|1941|p=141}}

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The earliest type one bracelets did not have ornamentations, while the later ones are engraved with groups of lines and angles or group of lines that alternate with lozenges (i.e. those from Sălaj).{{sfn|Hortensia H|1941|p=133}} This type is also common to the sites in: [[Domanesti]] ([[Sălaj County]]), [[Tăuteni]] ([[Bihor County]]) and [[Şpălnaca]] ([[Alba County]]).{{sfn|Hortensia H|1941|p=136}} Bracelets with quadrangular cross-section had previously been made of bronze, such as those at the beginning of the Hallstatt period. The gold ones are numerous, but are mostly of small dimensions; these smaller ones are considered to have been used as currency.{{sfn| Popescu | 1956|p= 212}}

The type two bracelets coil into spiral discs at only one end (terminal). At a later time, between the 8th and 7th centuries BC, they coiled at both terminals similar to the type three bracelets.{{sfn|Dumitrescu H|1941|p=141}}

The designs in type 3 bracelets, double-coiled (one at each of the two terminals), have also been found in bracelets from [[Şona|Biia]] ([[Alba County]] Romania), [[Fokoru]] (Heves, Hungary) and [[Bilje]] (Croatia).{{sfn|Dumitrescu H|1941|p=141}}

Spiral types similar to the Firighiaz type two have been found in a large area of Central and North-Western Europe: [[Bohemia]], North-East Hungary, [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Poznań]], West Poland, [[Pomerania]], [[Lithuania]], North [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], Germany ([[Bavaria]], [[Wurttemberg]], [[Turing]], [[Mecklenburg]]) and [[Romania]]. Their prototypes may have been provided by the [[Lusatian Culture]].{{sfn|Hortensia H|1941|p=140}} Some scholars believe that these bracelets were a kind of defensive weapon. This view is supported by the fact that this type was found usually on weapons deposits in Germany,{{sfn|Hortensia H|1941|p=137}} and that they appear to have been worn on the upper arm, as the traces of wear indicate.{{sfn|Childe|1930|p=120}}{{sfn|Hortensia H|1941|p=137}}

These locally-made bracelets from Firighiaz (Firiteaz), and from other [[Transylvanian]] finds, are half the size of the armlets of the similar style found in Germany and they could not be worn. It seems they were simple ornamental objects, a common trait to many similar items found in [[Romania]].{{sfn|Hortensia H|1941|p=137}} Transylvanian bracelets of this type are described as nearly circular with 57 and 63&amp;nbsp;mm diameter. Their rods are of a circular cross-section (max. 10&amp;nbsp;mm thickness) gradually tapering towards the ends, where the cross-section becomes quadrangular and begins to curl in a spiral. The diameter of the spiral discs is 30–35&amp;nbsp;mm. Each of these discs are made from four spirals.{{sfn|Hortensia H|1941|p=137}}

===== [[Acâş]] and [[Săcueni]] =====
According to Pârvan (1928), the style of Firighiaz artifacts evolved over a considerable period of time into the later form styles of the Dacian [[Hallstatt]]ian bracelets as found at [[Săcueni]] ([[Bihor County]]), [[Pipea]] ([[Mureș County]]) and [[Şona|Biia]] ([[Alba County]]).{{sfn|Pârvan|Vulpe|1928|p=57}}

Bracelets with double-volute ends like with Firighiaz type two, but with a different style, have been found at [[Acâş]] and [[Săcueni]].{{sfn| Popescu | 1956|p= 215}} These are made of lozenge bar with a décor made of relief globule (similar to bracelets found at [[Saint-Babel]]) with double-coiled terminals.{{sfn|Eluère|1982|p=163}} The gold bracelets from [[Săcueni]], as well as those from [[Acâş]] ([[Satu Mare County]]) and [[Hajdúszoboszló]] (Hungary) are typical Dacian bracelets of the Hallstatt period.{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=330}}

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Bronze bracelets of this type had previously been found in deposits belonging to the first Hallstatt period. Their ornamentation and groups of motifs is similar to the Firighiaz (Firiteaz) type. Analogous bracelets had also been found at [[Oradea]].{{sfn| Popescu | 1956|p= 215}} Two bracelets with spiral ends, dated to the Iron Age, have also been found in Dacian tombs of the Lower Danube.{{sfn|Linas|1887|p=288}}

=== "Horn motif" from Pipea, Biia and Boarta ===
[[File:Dacian goblet from Biia.jpg|thumb|right|The golden goblet from Biia with twin spiral terminals of the handles.{{sfn| Hoddinott |1989|p=53}}]]
Bracelets from [[Şona|Biia]] and [[Pipea]], found in the 19th century, have an unclear chronology.{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=239}} This series comprises a find from [[Abrud]] and another from an unknown [[Transylvania]]n location.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=59}} Some archaeologists are reporting them as dating to the Hallstatt,{{sfn|Şandric|2003|p=2}}{{sfn|Şandric|2008|p=2}} though Márton (1933) dated them to the early La Tene period.{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=222}} Popescu (1956) estimates these can be dated to the Hallstat phase B (1000–800 BC), but no later than C (800–650 BC).{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=239}} whereas Mozsolics (1970) dates them to 1,500 BC.{{sfn|Mozsolics|1970|p=143}} The so-called Biia bracelet was found with the Biia gold "[[kantharos]]" that can be dated between 1,500 and 1,000 BC.{{sfn|Eluère|1991|p=7o}} The handles of this goblet are also coiled into a double-spiral motif similar to other types of bracelets from the Carpathian area (i.e. Firigiaz 3, or Acas-Sacueni).{{sfn|Bouzek |1985|p=52}}

There, specimens are made of bronze and are prototypes of the Pipea–Biia–Boarta series of bracelets; therefore, scholars agree these bracelets had been made locally, in the Transylvanian goldsmith workshops. This opinion is supported by metal analysis.{{sfn|Kovacs|2001|p=48}}

These types of bracelets are possibly [[votive offering]]s, reminiscent of the [[Bull (mythology)|cult of the bull]].{{sfn|Eluère|1987|p=76}} Their common trait is the stylized motif of "horns". All of them have large C-shaped "horns" as terminals.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=59}}  As with the spiral, Hoddinott purports that the east-central European bronzesmiths used this horn symbol to provide the warrior with both physical and deistic protection.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=58}} In the Aegean Shaft Graves it occurs only on a stele, a gold bowl and three pairs of gold earrings, which Hoddinott considers to be possibly of central European origin.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=59}} This thematic motif of the Carpathian peoples is confirmed by other archaeological finds from Transylvania that include three large rings weighing between 0.20 kilograms (0.44 pounds) and 0.60 kilograms (1.32 pounds). Their terminals are animal heads facing each other, depicting the heads of horses in two cases and bulls-heads in the third.{{sfn|Eluère|1987|p=58}} Eluere (1987) identifies the endings of the Pipea-Biia bracelets with the cultic and religious powerful horns of the bull, and estimates that this myth was perpetuated for centuries.{{sfn|Eluère|1987|p=58}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

According to Hoddinott (1989), [[Horned deity|the horned animal cults]] that are attested with these horns motifs were brought by the transitional Indo-Europeanization period immigrants who adopted these stylized motifs as their main apotropaic symbol;{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=57}} however, the symbols of the horned animal replaced the local ones but were later associated with the sun-fire symbols of the earlier culture.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1981|p=165}}

The bracelet from [[Bilje]] (Croatia) belongs to the same Biia-Pipea type.{{sfn|Eluère|1987|p=76}}  Hartmann noted that the percentage of silver and tin in the bracelets from Belly (Croatia) and Pipea (Romania) is almost identical. This suggests both bracelets had been made in the same region.{{sfn|Kovacs|2001|p=48}} According to Marton, the armlets with semi-moon ends are part of an evolutionary series that terminates with the later silver snake-headed bracelets of the Classical Dacian times.{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=222}}

==== Boarta type ====
The bracelet from [[Şeica Mare|Boarta (Şeica Mare-Sibiu County)]] was discovered in 1891 and is dated to 600 BC. It might be an example of the last phases in the evolution of the Biia-Pipea gold artifacts (For the photo of Boarta bracelet see the gallery of links {{sfn|Wittenberger|2010|p=1}}) A very similar copy of the Boarta type has been found with the treasure from [[Dalj]], [[Slavonia]].{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=217}}

Unlike the Biia-Pipe type bracelets, the Boarta bracelet is flat, band-shaped, and has three raised ribs resembling the body of two other bracelets from [[Oradea]]. Its semi moon-shape terminals are smaller than the Biia-Pipea terminals;{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=217}} thus, some scholars derive the type of the Boarta bracelet to be from some earlier bronze bracelets whose ends widen and whose bodies have more ridges.{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=221}}

It seems that some other bracelets found at [[Bihor County|Bihor]], Oradea, [[Targu Mures]] and [[Timiș County|Făget]] could possibly belong to the Boarta type, and not to the Biia-Pipea type.{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=217}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Mosna, Sibiu County ====
The terminal adornments of this gold bracelet look like animals' heads, but the zoomorphic motif almost disappeared because of the geometric stylization (see picture ''Mosna 1'' above). It is dated to the Hallstatt period. This is not an isolated item, since it is stylistically connected to the geometric and zoomorphism of a collar and two bracelets from [[Veliki Gaj]] (Hungarian Nagygáj, Romanian Gaiu Mare) in Serbia.{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=345}}

== Zoomorphic bracelets ==
[[File:Muzeuldeistorienaturalavienaaurdacic4brasov.JPG|thumb|right|Gold bracelet with horse heads from [[Vad-Făgăraș]], [[Brașov County]] at [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], Vienna.{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=221}}{{sfn|Coles|Harding|1979|p=366}}]]
In the past, on the basis of a relatively small selection of archaeological finds, some scholars considered that the art of Geto-Dacians was geometrical and non-iconic. This led to the zoomorphic representations of Dacian bracelets being seen as an expression of the art of the steppes people, and Scythian art in particular. The majority of archaeological finds to date show that the main aspect of Geto-Dacian [[toreutics]] is in fact a zoomorphic motif style of its own.{{sfn|Gramatopol |1992|p=1}} This Dacian style of animal art occurs at the time when various ancient historical sources begin to record the Geto-Dacians as an ethnic entity of the larger Thracian family; therefore, this artistic expression might be considered as specific to the Dacian society of the last centuries BC.{{sfn|Gramatopol |1992|p=1}}

Some scholars sustain that the zoomorphic motifs of that particular time do not represent any kind of zoolatry of the Geto-Dacians. These would be iconographic motifs highlighting and multiplying certain attributes of the deities or of the kings.{{sfn| Sarbu| Florea |2000|p=152}}

=== Ox-headed bracelets (Târgu Mureş, Apoldu de Sus, Vad) ===
The tendency towards the apotropaic zoomorphism that crystallized at the end of the Iron Age I (i.e. bracelets from Biia, Pipea, Boarta etc.) is clearly manifested with the bracelets possessing ornamented ox heads of the Iron Age II (La Tene) from [[Târgu Mureş]] (Mureş County), [[Apoldu de Sus]] (Sibiu County), [[Şercaia|Vad]] (Braşov County) and one from an unknown Transylvanian find.{{sfn|Sanie|1995|p=24}} The bracelet from Apoldu de Sus seems to have an ox head at one terminus and a ram's head at the other end.{{sfn| Popescu | 1956|p= 218}}

The ox-head bracelets have been associated with the clay Hallstatian's [[Moon idol]], with which they  undoubtedly share a similarity.{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=221}}

The wires of these series of bracelets are thick, and decorated with ornamental protrusions.{{sfn| Popescu | 1956|p= 218}} Their characteristic decor consists of [[relief]] or incised circles, while there are also those with cuts or incisions that form a fir-tree motif.{{sfn|Sanie|1995|p=24}}

A bracelet with ox-heads discovered in the 19th century at Târgu Mureş (see [http://www.lessing-photo.com/dispimg.asp?i=07020269+&amp;cr=44&amp;cl=1 picture]) had been dated by some scholars to La Tene.{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=546}} Others such as Popescu (1956) dated this particular one to the last period of the Hallstatt, since it might have been deposited together with a semi-moon type bracelet of that period.{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=239}} As for the technique, it is noted that the bracelet from Targu Mures show a control of three-dimensional modeling,{{sfn|Sherratt|1984|pp=22, 23}} with silver inlays.{{sfn|Popescu|1950|p=28}} There are two other bracelets of a similar type in the Transylvania Museum, though they are known to be discovered in Transylvania the original site is unknown.{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=217}}

The religious meaning of the sacred horn had been lost over time, the circlets keeping this shape can only be described as decorative ornamentation.{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=221}} The bracelet found in 1817 at Vad–Fagaras (Brasov County) terminating with horse heads depicted as wearing a bridle, is part of the general trend of bracelets replacing the sacred horn as a motif.{{sfn|Popescu|1956|p=221}}{{sfn|Macrea|1978|p=197}}

}}
In 1959 two bracelets terminating with "horned-horses", were found at [[Cucuteni|Băiceni (Cucuteni)]].{{sfn|Sanie|1995|p=151}} They are dated to the end of the Iron Age I{{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=68}} and are found in the context of a hidden treasure of a Dacian nobleman.{{sfn|Makkay|1995|p=341}} The treasure comprised 2 kilograms of gold ornaments; a helmet, necklace, appliqués, harness, and buttons for vestments. They were ceremonial ensemble for kings or noblemen and their horses.{{sfn|Sîrbu|2004|pp=46, 47}} The bracelets and necklace terminate with [[protome]]s of horse heads and exhibit strong Thracian roots.{{sfn|Sîrbu|2004|p=47}}

The heads have also been interpreted as goat-heads ([[ibex]]).{{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=68}} Each head is very made of embossed gold foil with a filigree composition,{{sfn|Burda|1979|p=30}} and had sun-symbols on the middle of the forehead. They also have what may be seen as ram's- or goats-horns (see picture "''Head 1''" on the right).{{sfn|Sanie|1995|p=151}} These Băiceni gold artworks of the 4th century BC are viewed as one of the links transferring the Thracian and North Thracian Art forms and motifs across to the Dacian silversmiths.{{sfn|Florescu|Miclea|1979|p=27}}

== Iron Age II (La Tene) ==
Dacians replaced gold, the popular Transylvanian metal during the Iron Age I period, with silver during Iron Age II.{{sfn|Popescu|1941|p=187}} The types of ornaments also changed, perhaps due to new social structures and hierarchy or due to changes of the preferences of the populous and [[sacerdotal]] aristocracy.{{sfn|Sîrbu|2004|p=54}}

Dacians absorbed influences from the western Celts and eastern Scythians, but also proved their artistic originality.{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=540}} The bracelet style of the former is more individual, as they synthesized the older local elements originating from the Bronze Age into a new combination adapted to include the contemporary decorative forms and motifs.{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=540}}

Objects specific to warriors (armors, harnesses etc.) became preponderant from the 5th century BC onwards, in contrast to the decorative objects (bracelets, torques and pendants) that predominated in the Bronze Age, and in the transition period leading up to the Iron Age.{{sfn| Gramatopol | 1992|p= 1}} In the 2nd and 1st centuries BC gold and silver military objects are replaced so that the treasures of the late Dacian La Tene comprise ceremonial ensembles of silver ornaments and clothing accessories, bracelets along with some [[Typology of Greek vase shapes|mastos or footed cup]] vases .{{sfn|Sîrbu| 2007| p= 864}}{{sfn|Sîrbu| 2004| p=54}}

The geometrical and spiral motif ornamentation of earlier bracelets is more often replaced with zoomorphic and vegetal representations.{{sfn| Gramatopol | 1992|p= 1}} The decorations of bracelets that have been found, across the whole territory inhabited by Dacians, consist of lines cut into fir-tree shapes, dots, circlets, [[palmette]]s, waves, and bead motifs.{{sfn|Daicoviciu|1971|p=63}}

=== Toteşti bracelet ===
[[File:Gold snake-head bracelet Totesti-Hateg.jpg|thumb|left|Snake-headed Dacian bracelet from [[Totesti]]. Transitional Hallstatt-La Tene period{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=546}}]]
Various single-spiral bracelets made of solid quadrangular (rhombic) gold bars, whose overlapping ends represent the head of a snake, were found in 1889 at [[Toteşti]] in [[Hunedoara County]].{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=545}}{{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=339}} The head is geometrically stylized but clearly defined by decorative details. This artifact belongs to the so-called "Classic Dacian" period{{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=339}} and described as a "primitive work done by a not skilful hand".{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} It was noted that the snake head is realistically depicted by the representation of the eyes, ears and other elements of the [[vipera ammodytes]] that is so commonly found in the area. The same scholars related these gold circlets to the later silver multi-spirals snake [[protome]] and palmette bracelets from [[Romos|Vaidei-Romos]], [[Bălăuşeri|Senereuş]], [[Hetur]], [[Marca, Sălaj|Marca]] and [[Oradea Mare]].{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=545}} Other scholars consider that [[Toteşti]] snake-headed ornaments should be interpreted on the basis of an abstract contemporary stylistic type, and not as an imitation of reality. In this interpretation [[Toteşti]] bracelets are not connected with the snakes from the region of Deva, but they are a tradition that began in Hallstatt times with the "Scythian rings" and continued into the La Tène period.{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=546}}

In the [[Scythian tombs]] of Northern Hungary that are related to the Scythian invasions from around 700 BC, as well as in those of central Romania, spiral-shaped rings known as the "Scythian rings" have been found; with one end forming a fantastic animal, such as a dragon or serpent. These apotropaic creatures, themselves [[Turano-Siberian]] varieties of old [[Mesopotamian monsters]], might have provided the model for the Dacian protome bracelet from [[Toteşti]]{{sfn|Pârvan|Vulpe|1928|p=58}}—but neither the Scythian animals nor the Greek decorations appear to have had great success in Dacia, since the native geometric style continued to predominate.{{sfn|Henry|1928|p=288}}

Analogies to the Totesti bracelets can be found not only to the multi-spiral bracelets, but also in the overlapping-end bracelets whose ends  sometimes terminate with stylized animal heads.{{sfn| Popescu | 1956|p= 227}}

The archaeological findings dated to this period of time comprise the following  types:
* One-spiral bracelet made of bar with engraved ends (mostly [[Hatching]] and [[Zigzag]]){{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=542-543}}
* Bracelets with non-joined ends. It originates from Bronze Age i.e. from [[Spalnaca]] type {{sfn|Popescu|1948|p=54}} {{sfn|Turcu|1979|p=153}}
* Bracelet made of bar having a plastic decoration of a Celtic type "S", i.e. [[Gyoma]]{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=542-543}}
* Bracelets with overlapped ends (i.e. [[Slimnic]] (Sibiu County) and [[Sâncrăieni]] (Harghita County).{{sfn|Popescu|1948|p=54}} {{sfn|Turcu|1979|p=153}} These are artifacts of local Hallstattian tradition originating from the first period of the Iron Age, and preserved until the late La Tene period.{{sfn| Szekely | 1965|p=57}}{{sfn|Turcu| 1979|p=153}} Analogous models dated to the late Hallstatt period have been found at [[Gogoşu, Mehedinţi|Balta Verde]] and [[Gogoşu, Mehedinţi|Gogosu]] (both in Mehedinti County).{{sfn| Szekely | 1965|p=57}}
* Bracelets with slightly widened or thickened ends.{{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=68}}
* Multi-spirals bracelet found with [[Slimnic]] treasure.{{sfn|Vauthey|Vauthey|1968|p=345}} This is a re-adaptation of the older Carpathian spiral bracelet, earlier forms of it have been found in Bronze Age deposits at [[Gogoşu, Mehedinţi|Balta Verde]] and [[Gogoşu, Mehedinţi|Gogoşu]] (Mehedinti County).{{sfn|Turcu|1979|p=153}} This type could be considered as being just a simple form of the multi-spiral with protomes and palmettes.{{sfn|Szekely|1965|p=57}}

== Bracelets in the "Classical Dacian" period of the Dacian State ==
The Dacian silver bracelet is one of the characteristic artworks of this period, and the most representative ornament on them is the snake protome.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1986|p=87}}{{sfn|Popescu|1959|p=22}} Dacian bracelets have mainly been thought of as women's adornments but it can not be excluded that some types of bracelets, especially the multi-spirals ones, represented insignia of politico-military and [[sacerdotal]] functions and therefore worn by men.{{sfn | Berindei | Candea | 2001|p=749}}

Bracelets became part of the objects that Dacians selected as votive offerings deposited outside settlements. Such offerings have been found in a fountain at [[Ciolanestii din Deal]], Teleorman County, where silver bracelets and vases dated to 2nd or 1st century BC were found, and finds beside a lake in a forest at [[Contesti, Argeş|Contesti]], Argeş County, where bracelets, pearls, and a [[drachma]] were found.{{sfn|Sârbu|2007|p=862}}

Types of the La Tene II  period (150 BC – 100 AD) include:
* Bracelets with the ends curled back around the bracelet's wire i.e. [[Cerbal]] (Hunedoara County) and Remetea (Timis County){{sfn|Popescu|1948|p=54}} {{sfn|Turcu|1979|p=153}}
* Bracelets made of multiple twisted wires i.e. at [[Cerbăl]]{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=542-543}} In the La Tène Age, this type appears to have been developed from the twisted types of the Bronze Age IV from Spalnaca.{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=550}}
* Bracelets with double torsade i.e. [[Cerbăl]]{{sfn| Spanu | 2003|p=11}}
* Bracelets made of decorated band with circles and dotted lines i.e. [[Cerbăl]]{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=542-543}}
* Bracelets made of ribbed bar{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=542-543}}
* Bracelets with single- or multi-spirals terminating with snake heads{{sfn|MacKenzie|1986|p=87}}

=== Regional finds ===
According to Horedt (1973), silver Dacian treasure finds can be typologically categorized into north and south groups, divided by the [[Târnava River]]. In the contact zone between them the artifacts are common to both zones.{{sfn|Rustoiu|2002|p=97}} In this classification the silver multi-spiral bracelets that are ornamented with palmettes and snake protomes would belong to the southern group.{{sfn|Rustoiu|2002|p=97}}

==== East of the Carpathian Mountains ====
The Dacian bracelets that have been found East of the Carpathians can be categorized into two main types:
* Non-joined ends i.e. those found at [[Poiana, Galaţi|Poiana]] (Galati County) and Gradistea ([[Brăila County]]). Numerous specimens are made of bronze, such as those found at Brad, Racatau and Poiana.{{sfn|Rustoiu|2002|p=102}}{{sfn|Condraticova|2010|p=117}}
* Overlapped ends that are coiled onto the wire itself.{{sfn|Rustoiu|2002|p=102}} {{sfn|Condraticova|2010|p=117}} This type has ornamentation consisting of geometrical motifs and sometimes of snake protomes.{{sfn|Condraticova|2010|p=117}}

The characteristic metals used for bracelets found in the area of the [[Siret River]] valley are bronze and iron,{{sfn|Rustoiu|2002|p=102}} though silver was also probably used; a silver bracelet was found with a treasure of coins buried after 119–122 AD.{{sfn|Rustoiu|2002|p=97}}

In the Prut-Dniester region sub-types have been  identified such as:
* Bronze bracelets such as those found at [[Trebujeni]], [[Maşcăuţi]] and [[Hansca]]
* Non-joined ends, bar with vegetal décor such as those from [[Tudora, Ştefan Vodă|Palanca-Tudora]]
* Bracelets made of 3–6 twisted bronze wires with flattened ornaments in the middle.{{sfn|Condraticova|2010|p=118}}
* Multi-spiral types, such as the bracelets from the treasure found at [[Mateuţi]] ([[Rezina District]]) dated to the 4th century BC. This treasure includes two silver bracelets, one with five spirals and one with three.{{sfn| Arnăut|Naniu|1996| p= 44}}

==== Moesia Superior ====
Dacian bracelets have been found in deposits from [[Tekija (Kladovo)|Tekija]], [[Bare (Požarevac)|Bare]],{{sfn|Popović|2004|p=41}} [[Veliko Središte]]{{sfn| Mărghitan | 1979|p= 164}} and [[Paraćin]].{{sfn|Kolaric|1970|p=22}}

The style and type of the bracelets from Tekija and Bare are similar to the Dacian silver types; i.e. bracelets made of twisted wire and bracelets with overlapped ends that are coiled around the wire itself.{{sfn|Popović|2004|p=41}} Even though the origins of this type should not necessarily be located in Dacia itself, since bracelets of this type are scattered throughout the entire Balkan-Danube area, the earliest dated bracelets from Tekija and Bare are very large, as were those typical of the Dacian cultural complex.{{sfn|Popović|2004|p=42}} Bracelets with ends shaped as a head of, or tail of, a serpent are well represented in the Dacian deposits that are found at the Bare.{{sfn|Popović|2004|p=42}}

The Dacian bracelets that are decorated with spiral end-pieces, i.e. Belgrad—[[Guberevac (Leskovac)]], along with thin Dacian silver necklaces found in East Serbia, characterize the presence of a Dacian La Tene culture at [[Paraćin]] in Serbia.{{sfn|Kolaric|1970|p=22}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Bracelets with cord ornaments ===
An important category of the jewelry in the Daco-Getic environment are bronze bracelets with cord ornaments, whose typology consists of three types held in the Blaj Museum and in Simleul Silvaniei. Such [[circlet]]s had been discovered at Ardeu, Cuciulata (Brasov), Costesti (Hunedoara), Ocnita (Valcea), Pecica (Arad), Simleul Silvaniei (Sălaj), Tilisca (Sibiu) and in the Orăstie Mountains.{{sfn| Plantos | 2005|p=77}} These ornaments do not seem to be specific to pre-Roman Dacia, as they were widely spread in contemporary Germany, Poland, Czech, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia—all during the La Tene period.{{sfn| Plantos | 2005|p=78}} Since their diameter is around 10&amp;nbsp;cm, apart from those found in Simleul Silvaniei and Orăstie which are 6&amp;nbsp;cm and 7.5&amp;nbsp;cm, they were probably worn on the arm or as anklets.{{sfn| Plantos | 2005|p=79}} They have been found mainly in fortresses or important centers of pre-Roman Dacia, and appear to have been prestige items of the local aristocracy.{{sfn| Plantos | 2005|p=79}}

=== Bracelets with a double torsade ===
This type have been found with treasures from Cerbăl (Hunedoara County), Bistrita (Bistriţa-Năsăud County), [[Drăgeşti]] (Bihor County), [[Oradea-Sere]] (Bihor County), [[Saracsău]] (Alba County), and [[Tilişca]] (Sibiu County). The bracelets are made of wire turned two or three times to form a semicircular terminal. The three-turns style is seen only with a single bracelet from Cerbăl. These terminals are always decorated with stamped-dotted lines and are dated to the 1st century BC.{{sfn| Spanu | 2003|p=11}}

This type was designed and preferred by the intra-Carpathian regions. Only one presence occurs in the Danube area, at Iron Gates.{{sfn| Spanu | 2003|p=12}} Since this bracelet appears to have been a prestige ornament, its presence south of the Carpathians is seen as a component of the relationships between the elites of the two neighboring regions.{{sfn| Spanu | 2003|p=12}}

=== The material of bracelets ===
[[File:KunsthistorischesMuseumDacianGold3.jpg|thumb|right| Dacian silver ornaments ([[Kunsthistorisches Museum]])]]
[[File:KunsthistorischesMuseumDacianGold6.jpg|thumb|right|Silver Dacian treasures (dated to La Tene) found in Transylvania Romania (Kunsthistorisches Museum)]]

In the Bronze Age IV and Hallstatt periods Dacia was characterized by gold treasures and by a particular gold art, whereas archaeological finds dated to the La Tene period are mostly made of silver.{{sfn| Popescu | 1956|p= 244}}{{sfn|Glodariu|Sima|Iaroslavschi|Gheorghiu|2008|p=146}} This is a common characteristic of the Illyrian and Eastern Alps regions of the time, and not limited to the Dacian area.{{sfn| Popescu | 1956|p= 244}} Some scholars, such as Glodariu, explain the scarcity of gold ornaments and bracelets in Dacian treasures by a custom of the Dacians, Celts, Germans and Romans in reserving golden ornaments for the king alone.{{sfn|Glodariu|Sima|Iaroslavschi|Gheorghiu|2008|p=146}} Other scholars, such as Florescu, put forth the hypothesis of religious restrictions regarding the use of gold in the period of the Dacian state.{{sfn|Florescu|1970|p=135}}

The golden Dacian bracelets, and indeed most of the jewelry, that has been found so far are made of unrefined gold from the [[Apuseni Mountains]].{{sfn|Oberländer-Târnoveanu|Gheorghe|Migdonia|Tudor|2010|p=9}}

The silver of the Dacian bracelets and other ornaments of the time always contain between 0.63 and 6.35% gold.{{sfn|Seculici|2008|p=69}} In some scholars opinions, such as Oberländer-Târnoveanu, it was obtained by melting Greek and Roman coins as well as importing from Balkan sources.{{sfn|Oberländer-Târnoveanu|Gheorghe|Migdonia|Tudor|2010|p=9}} Others, Popescu for example, support the thesis of a local extraction of silver from the Apuseni Mountains.{{sfn|Popescu|1941|p=197}}

The work and typology of the silver multi-spirals snake-headed bracelets suggests the existence of a large manufacturing center, located most probably near the Dacian sites of the [[Orastie Mountains]].{{sfn|Popescu|1941|p=188}} From there silver artifacts spread throughout the entire area of modern-day Transylvania; and, as archaeological finds prove, these art works become later known in areas that encompass the modern regions of [[Moldavia]], [[Muntenia]] and [[Oltenia]].{{sfn|Popescu|1941|p=188}}

In the second phase of La Tène, reasoned on the basis of finds, Dacia appears to have experienced a temporary "silver crisis", probably related to an increase in the minting of silver [[denarii]]; therefore, bracelets dated to that time had been made of mild alloy and only plated with a silver layer about 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm (0.004&amp;nbsp;inch) thick. The layer was so well welded that the welding can not be identified by the naked eye, even in cross sections.{{sfn|Glodariu|1997|p=25}} Specimens of the group include finds from [[Sarmasag]] (Salaj County) and [[Dersca]] (Botosani County). There were also similar finds at [[Slimnic]] (Sibiu County) and Herastrau Bucuresti.{{sfn|Rustoiu|1996|p=47}}
[[File:KunsthistorischesMuseumDacianGold1.jpg|thumb|left|A gilded silver belt fragment Cioara – Alba County dated [[La Tene]] depicts warriors wearing bracelets{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=532}}]]

=== Representations depicting the wearing of Dacian bracelets ===
The Dacian phalera from [[Cergău|Lupu-Cergău, Alba County]], depicts a feminine divinity wearing some circlets on her arms. Some scholars identified these with a representation of the Dacian bracelet types.{{sfn|Spânu|1998|p=49}}{{sfn|Crișan|1993|p=45}}

In 1820 at [[Săliştea|Cioara (today Săliştea)]] a fragmentary gilded silver plaque was discovered, dated to La Tène III, and primitively decorated ''[[au repousse]]'' ("by embossing"), with representations of two human characters, probably warriors.{{sfn|Oltean|2007|p=106}} Hatched bands are visible on the arms and wrists  that resemble regular bracelets.{{sfn|Florescu|Miclea|1979|p=16}} Even though the motifs of the plaque do not seem to be local, since it differs in some respects from those depicted on [[Trajan's Column]], the silver-work itself seems to be Dacian. Other than the Dacians, no-one was working in this style at that time. The silversmith who made it is probably the same one who made the well known Dacian snake-headed bracelets from Hunedoara County.{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=534}}

A fragment from the Forum of Roman Emperor Trajan (2nd century AD) in Rome has a relief of a seated female, probably a Dacian (''Dacia Capta'' – "the conquered Dacia"). She is depicted wearing a bracelet on each arm below the shoulder.{{sfn|Packer|Sarring |1997|p=377}}

===Bracelets with a snake-motif===
This motif is found with both the multi-spiral bracelets and also with the simple bracelets.{{sfn|Pârvan|Vulpe|1928|p=641}}
[[File:Dacian bracelet type Slimnic1.jpg|thumb|left|Dacian bracelet from Transylvania; [[Slimnic]] type (La Tene Age){{sfn|Popescu|1948|p=54}}]]

* Multi-spiral silver bracelets terminating with portions of [[palmette]]s and snake [[protome]] terminals at each end, i.e. those found at [[Cojocna]], [[Mărunţei|Bălăneşti (Mărunţei)]], [[Rociu]], [[Coada Malului]]{{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=68}}{{sfn| Spanu |Cojocaru|2009|p=99}} [[Caţa|Drauseni (Caţa)]] (destroyed by 1941),{{sfn|Popescu|1941|p=198}} [[Feldioara]] and [[Orastie]].{{sfn|Popescu|1941|p=196}} The endings of some of the bracelets were gilded: i.e. [[Coada Malului]] {{sfn|Vauthey|Vauthey|1968|p=346}} and [[Orastie]].{{sfn|Popescu|1941|p=196}}
* Multi-spiral bracelets with snake-heads at each terminal, but whose terminals do not have the palmettes, that are plaques decorated with large scales, i.e. those from [[Herastrau|Herastrau (Bucuresti)]] dated to the 1st century BC.{{sfn| Spanu |Cojocaru|2009|p=99}} A bracelet from [[Buneşti-Avereşti|Bunesti]] ([[Vaslui County]]) is similar to the one from Herastrau, but it is dated earlier than the 1st century BC.{{sfn| Bazarciuc |1983|p= 264}}
* Simple bracelets, where stylized snake heads terminate the ends.{{sfn|Florescu|Daicoviciu|Roşu|1980|p=68}} The ends are either in the shape of an animal's head summarily but adroitly stylized, as in the case of the [[Slimnic]] bracelets, or in other cases the animal's head is suggested by a few engraved lines, and the decorated ends were gilded.{{sfn|Popescu|1971|p=45}} Finds include those from: [[Ocnita]] (Valcea County),{{sfn|Rustoiu|1996|p=46}} [[Poiana, Galaţi|Poiana]] (Tecuci),{{sfn|Popescu|1941|p=201}} Săcălăsău Nou (Bihor County),{{sfn|Gorun|Doina|Sever|Lucia|1988|p=116}} in Romania; and also from [[Jakabszállás]] in Hungary.{{sfn|Toma|2007|p=66}}
* Bronze bracelets cast and incised with snake [[protome]]s, i.e. those found in [[Râşnov]], [[Braşov County]], and dated to the 2nd or 1st century AD.{{sfn|Costea|2008|p=1}}

==== Description of the silver multi-spiral bracelets with palmettes and protomes at both terminals ====
There are about 27 known Dacian silver or silver-gilt multi-spiral bracelets terminating with rectangular plaques and snake head [[protome]]s. They are exhibited or kept in repositories and museums in Bucharest (Romania), Budapest (Hungary) and Belgrade (Serbia).{{sfn|Constantinescu|2009|p=1031}} Additionally the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] holds Dacian silver bracelets such as the one found at [[Orastie]] (Hunedoara County){{sfn| Candea| 2010|p= 52}} and the one from Feldioara (Brasov County).{{sfn| Candea| 2010|p= 52}}{{sfn|Florescu|Miclea|1979|p=21}}
[[File:Dacian Silver Bracelet at the National Museum of Romanian History 2011.jpg|thumb|left| Silver bracelet from [[Rociu]] ([[Arges County]])]]

All of these silver works are characterized by their large size. For example, the one found at [[Bălăuşeri|Senereuş]], now in the [[Brukenthal Museum]] weights aropund 0.4 kilograms (0.88 pounds). The wire used is 206&amp;nbsp;cm (6 feet 9&amp;nbsp;inches) long and 0.4&amp;nbsp;cm (0.157&amp;nbsp;inches) thick, while the heads are 21&amp;nbsp;cm each (8.26&amp;nbsp;inches). The inside diameter of the coils is 12.5&amp;nbsp;cm (4.92&amp;nbsp;inches) with an outside diameter of 13.3&amp;nbsp;cm (5.2&amp;nbsp;inches). These large diameters and the heavy weight of these armlets would suggest wearing them on the upper arm or on the leg.{{sfn|Pârvan|Vulpe|1928|p=548}}{{sfn|Oberländer-Târnoveanu|2011|RAN ID=115691.01}} The coils of the specimen from [[Cluj Napoca]] have an even bigger outside diameter at 16&amp;nbsp;cm (6.3&amp;nbsp;inches);{{sfn|Popescu|1941|p=196}} therefore, it is supposed that it was worn on the thigh or forearm over clothes{{sfn|Popescu|1971|p=45}}

The specimen from the Transylvanian Museum at Cluj weighs 0.358 kilograms (0.79 pounds). It has been made by hammering a silver bar of a circular cross-section. It has 4 spirals and the ends are flattened, decorated with seven palmettes made by punching. The surfaces of the palmettes, and their extremities, are decorated with the "fir-tree" motif and incised circles.{{sfn|Pupaza|2010|p=1}}

The multi-spiral from Belgrad Museum has an interesting particularity in that the impression of the palmette motif has two [[puncheon (barrel)|puncheon]]s of different dimensions. This might have been done in order to avoid the stereotypy of models.{{sfn| Mărghitan | 1979|p= 164}}

===== Origins =====
Snakes are depicted in Dacian toreutics from the 6th and 5th centuries BC, and also in the later period.{{sfn | Sanie| 1995|p=145}} Both types of bracelets with snake protomes, those of simple and multiple spirals, show an ancient Thracian tradition from the Hallstatt period (the Geto-Thracian period) of Geto-Dacian art evolution.{{sfn|Berciu|1974|p=217}} Snake-shaped bracelets, and other ornaments of the same kind, speak not only of the spread of the decorative motif but also of a symbol and significance of this motif in the Dacian period.{{sfn|Ispas|1980|p=279}}

Some scholars suppose that the Scythians provided the model of the snake décor found in the Classical Dacian bracelets, on the basis that the semi-spiraled Scythian snake type rings, were common in Dacia after the Hallstatt period. Those rings might have been continuously used until the La Tène period, or perhaps until the Roman era, as can be seen with a necropolis from [[Roşia, Sibiu|Caşolţ]], Sibiu County.{{sfn|Pârvan|Vulpe|1928|p=641}}{{sfn| Banateanu| 1971|p=38}} If this was the case, Shchukin suggests it was a matter of transferred ideas rather than of imports.{{sfn| Shchukin| 1989|p=89}}

These bracelets types can be explained by the typology of the local tradition of the Hallstattian period; and there were similar bracelets in the Thracian world of today's Romania and Bulgaria.{{sfn|Berciu|1974|p=217}}{{sfn|Florescu|Miclea|1979|p=27}} Such examples include a mid-3rd-century BC spiral dragon-headed ring; a spiral snake-headed ring from [[Nesebar|Nesebar (Messembria)]]; 4th century BC spiraled bracelets from [[Aitos]]; and a 3rd-century BC snake-headed ring of unknown origin in the British Museum.{{sfn|Florescu|Miclea|1979|p=27}}

The manufacture of the spirals, by wrapping the silver wire several times, belongs to the traditions of the Bronze Age;{{sfn|Henry|1928|p=290}} but those with their ends flattened, and decorated on the outside with [[intaglio (jewellery)|intaglio]] palmettes, belong to a more modern style according to Popescu.{{sfn|Popescu|1941|p=193}} The way in which these dragon patterned bracelets were developed by the Dacians was new, while its resemblance to the workmanship and style of other countries are so few, that these bracelets might very well be considered as specifically Dacian. It can be distinguished as a Dacian style since they remained faithful to their own geometric representations,{{sfn|Pârvan|Vulpe|1928|p=141}} and the palmette motif is not found in the neighboring areas.{{sfn | Mărghitan | 1979|p=164}}

==== The dragon and snake-head motif ====
Within the multi-spiral  group of bracelets with palmette scales, two sub-groups can be stylistically identified – one represented by the Feldioara find and the other by the Orastie find. These sub-groups show that the snake and dragon types were not absolutely immutable in the imagination of the Dacian silversmiths. Two variants were introduced: mammal head – snake head and crest – mane,{{sfn|Florescu|Miclea|1979|p=27}} as well as some transitional versions.{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=22}}

[[File:Dacian bracelet-ends snake-heads.jpg|thumb|left|Details of the "dragon" head of both ends; Silver bracelets from [[Hetur]], [[Romos|Vaidei (Romos)]] and [[Darlos]] Romania{{sfn|Hampel|1888|p=278}}]]

The bracelet discovered around 1856 at [[Orăștie]] consists of a single silver wire, with a circular cross-section, coiled into eight equal spirals terminating in a dragon head at both ends. It is analogous to the bracelet from Feldioara but its head is different in that the head is almost triangular.{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=25}} It has been made in a richer figurative manner than others.{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=14}}

The multi-spiral bracelet with zoomorphic (snake?) ends, found in 1859 with a treasure from [[Feldioara]], is different because of the widened muzzle of the [[protome]] terminals. In the middle of the snake head the Dacian silversmith engraved braids, by the use of puncheons, consisting of two rows of small, oblique, divergent traits. The snake's eyes are depicted as two circles. A strong profile separates the head from a relatively rectangular plaque with rounded corners, and slightly arched edges representing the mane of the [[Dacian Draco|Dacian dragon]]. The profiled relief edges of the bracelet's rectangular plaque and its decoration with two rows of divergent slashes are suggestive of the mane of a dragon or wolf.{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=87}}

The bracelets from the Museum of Transylvania found in Cluj, Hetiur ([[Mureș County]]) and [[Ghelința]] are characterized by a more [[wikt:trenchant|trenchant]] cutting and a more prominent relief for modeling the head. These traits are unlikely to represent a specific ophidian form and the longitudinal axis is marked by a stylistically different means.{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=22}}

The zoomorphic motif of the bracelets depicts a fantastic animal with the head and body of a serpent but the muzzle of a mammal, pointed or square, with a thick mane flowing on its back prolonged by a poly-lobed (multiple palmettes) body. {{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=87}}{{sfn|Pârvan|Vulpe|1928|p=141}} The analysis of these Dacian symbols, performed by scholars—such as Florescu (1979), Pârvan (1926), and Bichir (1984)—conclude that the symbol of the snake or dragon appears on the Geto-Dacian La Tene bracelets and on the [[Dacian Draco|Dacian standard (flag)]] that can be seen on [[Trajan's Column]].{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=87}}{{sfn|Pârvan|Vulpe|1928|p=141}}{{sfn|Bichir|1984|p=54}} The Dacians dragon probably combines two meanings: the agility and redoubtable ferocity of the wolf with the protective role of the snake.{{sfn|Sârbu|2000|p=170}} It was supposed to encourage the [[Getae]] and to scare their enemies.{{sfn| Sirbu | 1997|p= 89}} It also appeared to have been the only one known representation of the religious character of the Dacians of the time.{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=641}} Scholastic interpretations vary between considering this a representation of a "flying dragon", related to a [[Sky God]],{{sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=520}} or a [[chthonic]] symbol.{{sfn|Tutilă|2004|p=5}}

Some bracelets from south of the Carpathians, such as those from [[Coada Malului]], [[Dâmbovița County|Bălăneşti]] and [[Rociu]]; and some from north of the Carpathians such as those from [[Dârlos]] and [[Romos|Vaidei (Romos)]]) do not have decorative elements to mark the median line on the rectangular plaque (the wider and flat portion coming next to the head). They instead have wavy lines, finely engraved, suggesting a mane or ridge.{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=26}} A similar style is seen in specimens from [[Bălăuşeri|Senereuş]], [[Dupuş]] (Sibiu County) and from the unknown Transylvanian site, the fragment of which is kept at the Budapest Museum. On the latter, the beam of wavy lines has been replaced by horizontal, short and dense, finely engraved lines.{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=26}}

The rectangular portion of the bracelets from Bălăneşti and Transylvania show a tendency to split into two teardrop-shaped lobes.{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=26}} On the subgroup of bracelets from [[Coada Malului]], the fir-tree is depicted only schematically.{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=26}}

It was also noted that the snakes from the Agighiol artifacts of the 4th century BC, especially the depicted heads of snakes, have a stylization similar to that of the Dacian bracelet protomes; they have the same triangular form, and the same distribution of the decorations that mark the eye of the snake.{{sfn|Berciu|1974|p=217}}

====The leaf motifs of the multi-spiral bracelets====
[[File:Palmettes of Dacian silver bracelet.jpg|thumb|left|Detail: the fir-tree motif and the rectangular portion of the silver bracelet (1st century BC) repository [[Cluj-Napoca]] Museum{{sfn| Pupeză |2010|p=1}}]]
[[File:Palmettes of Dacian bracelets Kunsthistorisches.jpg|thumb|left|Detail, palmette motif of the bracelet from Orastie (1st century BC)]]
[[File:Peretu Helmet side view Muzeul National de Istorie al Romaniei.jpg|thumb|right|Palmettes on 4th-century BC helmet (some bracelets have similar palmette as the Agighiol helmet{{sfn|Berciu|1974|p=210}})]]

The flattened bands of the bracelets are decorated externally with a chain of geometrized palmettes that have been struck in much the same way as coins.{{sfn|Pârvan|Vulpe|1928|p=141}} It seems that the leaf-like ornaments have been made by impression, using ready-made moulds, as used in the manufacture of Dacian cups from the La Tène [[Balaciu|Crasani (com. Balaciu)]] site. Scholars, such as Popescu, related the chain of successive palmettes of the Dacian bracelets to the decoration of the borders on the Scythian Melgunov dagger sheath from the 6th century BC.{{sfn|Popescu|1941|p=193}} Others consider that several multi-spiral bracelets, i.e. from [[Mărunţei|Balanesti]] (Olt), have the same palmette motif as the typical decorations of the 4th-century BC Thracian-Getic helmet from [[Valea Nucarilor|Agighiol (com. Valea Nucarilor)]], [[Tulcea]].{{sfn|Berciu|1974|p=210}} In the opinion of Berciu, the palmette motif was adopted from the Greeks of the Black Sea coast during the Geto-Thracian Art period.{{sfn|Berciu|1974|p=217}}

Dacian bracelets exhibit four decorative types of leaf-like triangular lobes: first is the most complex is of oval or triangular palmettes; the second is interpreted as representing fern leaves (e.g. the Orastie bracelet); the third is the fir-tree motif, where the rounded lobes become straight lines resembling a fir-tree branch; and the fourth whose shape preserves only the medial [[Leaf#Veins|vein]] and the circles, suggesting the spiral arching of the lobes (e.g. the Feldioara bracelet).{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=87}}

The palmettes are more precisely outlined and more faithfully preserve the original lobes and palmette character, with several bracelets such as those from the Cluj Museum, Hetiur and Ghelinta. They are farthest away from a schematic fir-tree motif.{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=22}} A stylized ivy leaf-like style is common to the group of bracelets from Coada Malului, Rociu and Bălăneşti ([[Arges County]]), and Dupuş. It is formed using carved lines doubled with a fine series of dots.{{sfn|Florescu |Miclea |1979|p=27}}

===== The same motif seen in other ornaments =====
The decorative snake style has been adopted in other types of ornaments, such as earrings from [[Blandiana|Răcătău]] and spiral rings from [[Sprâncenata]] and [[Mihăileşti|Popeşti-Novaci]].{{sfn|Sîrbu|Florea| 2000|p=169}}

The silver ring from [[Măgura, Teleorman]] has four-and-a-half multi-spirals with snake-head terminals and a chain of five palmettes.{{sfn|Mirea|2008|p=1}} It belongs to a small silver treasure—comprising three [[denarii]] that could be dated between 148–106 BC, and one ornament (the ring) —fortuitously discovered in 2005 and 2006 in a spot 330&amp;nbsp;m from Măgura village.{{sfn|Mirea|2009|p=99}} The ring is considered by some, e.g. Mirea (2009), to be a miniaturized representation of the typical multi-spiral bracelets terminating with palmettes and snake protomes.{{sfn|Mirea|2009|p=100}} There are particular analogies with the bracelets from Bălăneşti–Olt and Rociu–Argeş; as well as analogies with the spiral rings from Sprâncenata and Popeşti.{{sfn|Mirea|2009|p=100}} The decorations are similar to a motif of the gold multi-spiral bracelets discovered in 1999–2001 at [[Sarmizegetusa Regia]].{{sfn|Mirea|2009|p=100}}

[[File:Transylvanian silver snake-headed bracelet (Ancient Dacia).JPG|thumb|left|Silver snake-headed multi-spirals bracelet 1st century BC to 1st century AD (Transylvania, Romania).{{sfn|Hampel|1888|p=278}}]]

The multi-spiral bracelets made of plates with zoomorphic extremities, all of them made of silver and sometimes gilded, are characteristic of the north-Danubian Dacian elite, in particular ones from Transylvania.{{sfn|Arsenescu|Sirbu|2006|p=170}} Also, according to Medelet (1976), one Dacian silver bracelet from [[Malak Porovets]] ([[Isperih Municipality]] Bulgaria) and one Dacian silver bracelet from [[Velika Vrbica]] (Serbia), belong to the same typology.{{sfn|Spânu|Cojocaru|2009|p=111}} Some of this type of bracelets, such as the one in the [[Cluj-Napoca Transilvanias History Museum]] and the two others in the National Museum Budapest (Hungary), are from unknown Transylvanian sites.{{sfn|Florescu|Miclea|1979|p=27}}

It is possible the big silver multi-spirals were used with clothes worn for special celebrations,{{sfn|Sîrbu|Florea| 2000|p=169}} though they do not seem to have a simply decorative use.{{sfn|Crișan|1986|p=26}} {{sfn| Sârbu |2007|p=864}} The context of burying these prestige aristocratic insignia suggests that the treasures they compound were rather votive deposits than funeral offerings ([[cenotaph]]?).{{sfn|Spânu|1998|p=52}}

The silver snake-headed multi-spiral bracelets are found in the context of the so-called Dacian silver treasures.{{sfn| Sârbu| Florea|1997|p=32}} A significant fact regarding these treasures is the specificity of the time frame, from around 125 BC – 25 AD (one century).{{sfn|Spânu|1998|p=46}} In historical terms, they are contemporary to the reigns of [[Burebista]], [[Deceneus]] and [[Comosicus]]. It is probable that the hoards of silver bracelets and ornaments of the late Geto-Dacian began to be produced just prior to the reign of [[Burebista]], a possible example being the one from Sâncrăieni. The manufacturing of silver ornaments continued during his reign, although to a lesser extent (perhaps due to his authoritarian, despotic and purist nature), and mostly after his suppression of the manufacture (44 BC – 46 AD); therefore the silver hoard production lasted almost a century.{{sfn|Gramatopol|2008|p=1}} The burying of these Dacian silver jewelry items and bracelets (those made between 44 BC and 46 AD) occurred in the same period of time that was characterized by a scarcity of silver due to the turbulent situation in Dacia.{{sfn|Gramatopol|2008|p=1}}

This particular type of design has a unitary typology and a highly standardized character. It does not contain goods that had been accumulated over years, but only sets of certain objects.{{sfn|Spânu|1998|p=46}} Also, they have not been found in the context of settlements but outside them, on carefully prepared deposits.{{sfn|Spânu|1998|p=47}} These objects had not been temporarily concealed or hidden, because of some exposure to dangerous situations, but they were rather supposed to preserve the symbolic attributes of the social status in the afterlife.{{sfn|Spânu|1998|p=49}}

Several Dacian bracelets reached the collections of the Kunsthistorisches Vienna Museum through various channels: administrative, auctions, purchases, and donations. Though they were found in Transylvania, and belong to the similar archaeological context of the other Dacian silver treasures, they are rather accidental discoveries from the west and south of the Transylvanian plateau—both in the areas of the greatest concentration of Dacian culture in the [[Orăştie Mountains|Orăştie]] and [[Apuseni Mountains]], where precious metal mineral deposits were, and are, to be found.{{sfn|Florescu|Miclea|1979|p=85}}

[[File:Dacian Bracelet IMG 7402.JPG|thumb|left|Dacians gold bracelet from Sarmizegetusa Regia]]

Gold artifacts in general, and gold bracelets in particular, have been scarce archaeological finds during excavations. An explanation could be that the Romans collected all gold objects by force after conquering Dacia.{{sfn|Manaila|1976|p=90}} Some, including Manaila, explained the scarcity of these kinds of archaeological finds as due to Dacian religious reasons, all gold being collected by the priests and given to the Dacian king.{{sfn|Manaila|1976|p=90}} Numerous researchers, including Rustoiu, argued the existence of a royal monopoly of the gold and silver exploitation in Dacia;{{sfn|Rustoiu|1996|p=51}} and that after the Roman conquest, this monopoly passed to the Roman Emperor.{{sfn|Popescu|1971|p=44}}

=== Description ===
These gold bracelets, adorned with leaves and snake heads, weigh around 2.2 pounds (1 kilogram) each.{{sfn|Watson|2011|p=1}} There are remarkable analogies between the gold armlets and those made of silver from [[Măgurele, Prahova|Coada Malului]] (Prahova County), Senereuş (Hunedoara County), [[Orăştie]] (Hunedoara County) and [[Herăstrău]]-[[Bucureşti]].{{sfn|Constantinescu|Bugoi|Cojocaru|Niculescu|2007|p=12}} Most of them exhibit similar design and artistic themes, but there are no two identical bracelets.{{sfn|Constantinescu|2008|p=1}}
The decorations on these bracelets is similar to the style of the ring from Magura ([[Teleorman County]]).{{sfn|Mirea|2009|p=100}}

One such bracelet recovered in 2007 has both terminals depicting a stylized animal head, which represents a snake with a long muzzle, and is decorated with arched lines. The rectangular plaque's surface is decorated with transverse rows of arched incisions, grouped in four and a half [[Metope (architecture)|metopes]]. The body is composed of seven palmettes, consisting of a fir tree-shape, and a dotted line in the middle, while the terminals oppose each other.{{sfn|Trohani |2007|p=1}}

The number of spirals varies from six to eight. When uncoiled, some bracelets measure 2.30 m and others 2.80 m. The outside diameters range from 91 to 123&amp;nbsp;mm. The spirals consist of flat rectangular strips with richly incised decorations and stylized palmettes. In most of them, seven palmettes decorate both ends of the bracelets.{{sfn|Constantinescu|2009|p=1031}} The bracelets terminate with a decorative [[protoma]], a beast-head motif which looks like the head of an animal (a wolf, a snake or a dog).{{sfn|Constantinescu|2008|p=1}} The [[goldsmith]] technique, used for manufacturing all of these gold armlets, was the cold hammering of a rectangular-shaped gold ingot, followed by punching and engraving for their decorations. This was a typical method used by Dacians from the 4th century BC to 1st century AD.{{sfn|Constantinescu|2009|p=1031}}

A bracelet recovered in 2009 has ten spirals. The terminals depict a stylized snake protome. The long muzzle is straight cut and the eyes and eyebrows are represented by curved lines. The head continues onto a rectangular plaque of 3.4&amp;nbsp;cm in length whose relief edges are decorated with incised oblique lines in a "V" shape, separated by a medial line. This is followed by a series of six triangular-oval palmettes, made by three puncheons, and with a length of 14.3&amp;nbsp;cm. The first puncheon made the first two palmettes, the second made the next two palmettes, and the third was used for the last—which is also the smallest palmette. The palmettes have a foliage design and their edges are raised and decorated with small incised oblique lines.{{sfn|Trohani |2009|p=1}}

=== Context ===
[[File:Sarmizegetusa temples.jpg|thumb|right| Ruins of temple of the ancient [[Dacian language|Dacian]] fortress of Sarmizegetusa (Hunedoara County – Romania)]]
Some two dozen of the gold multi-spiral zoomorphic-headed bracelets were discovered by archaeological looting in different spots in the area of Sarmisegetusa Regia, in the Orăștie Mountains.{{sfn|Constantinescu|2009|p=1028}} By 2011, twelve out of the twenty-four looted gold bracelets had been recovered and are housed at the Romanian National History Museum in Bucharest.{{sfn|Watson|2011|p=1}}

An archaeological context has been reconstituted on the basis of a forensic science approach, technical description, and archaeological interpretation. The multi-spiral bracelets had been uncovered from pits near to the "Sacred area" of the Dacian capital at [[Sarmizegetusa Regia]] (Hunedoara County), around 600&amp;nbsp;m from the sacred enclosure. The pits are located on the steep rocky slopes outside the ancient settlements, in a narrow valley.{{sfn|Ciuta|Rustoiu|2007|p=109}} The bracelets site is located on a very steep and rocky area that involves a difficult climb and hinders "classical" archaeological approaches and research.{{sfn|Ciuta|Rustoiu|2007|p=109}}

The treasure hunters discovered a spot where they found ten golden bracelets in a pit dug into natural rock on a 70° slope.{{sfn|Glodariu|Sima|Iaroslavschi|Gheorghiu|2008|p=146}}  The pit had two distinct overlapped cavities of triangular shape made of slabs, one containing six  gold multi-spiral bracelets and the other four, that had each been deposited in pairs; the smaller bracelets were inserted into the larger ones.{{sfn|Ciuta|Rustoiu|2007|p=99}} The finding of bracelets on such steep sloping cliffs, and at the outer limits (eastern) of the settlements, provides a new perspective regarding the ancient sites used for depositing artifacts with special religious significance.{{sfn|Ciuta|Rustoiu|2007|p=109}} These deposits are composed of the same type of ornaments that have identical function and significance.{{sfn|Ciuta|Rustoiu|2007|p=109}}

The general circumstances of the placement of these bracelets, deposited by the ancient populous, in these specially constructed pits and covered with uncut slabs imply that these artifacts were components of votive offerings.{{sfn|Ciuta|Rustoiu|2007|p=110}}{{sfn|Constantinescu|Bugoi|Cojocaru|Niculescu|2010|p=1040}} It seems as if these bracelets were used during initiations, or occult ceremonies, restricted to a certain category of people that had very important positions in the state: the king; the leaders of cities; the nobles from the royal entourage; and the priests.{{sfn|Ciuta|Rustoiu|2007|p=110}} This explains the existence of similar pieces made of silver for the leading nobles and rulers of the cities, and the lack of similar specimens made of bronze, iron or other metals. It also explains why these types of bracelet do not appear in written sources, nor the figurative representations of the time.{{sfn|Ciuta|Rustoiu|2007|p=110}}

=== Chronology and authentication ===
Based on typological analogy and stylistic analysis, historians believe that these bracelets are authentic Dacian artifacts.{{sfn|Constantinescu|Bugoi|Cojocaru|Niculescu|2007|p=11}} Some chronological evidence is provided by dark blotches that indicate a long period of time underground, and also by the ancient coins that were found along with bracelets. These coins point to the late 2nd century BC and the first decades of the 1st century BC. It appears that the bracelets were buried, if not necessarily crafted, during a time frame between 100 – 70 BC.{{sfn|Constantinescu|Bugoi|Cojocaru|Niculescu|2010|p=1040}}

The chronology of these bracelets corresponds to the emergence of the building of religious sanctuaries, digging and arranging pits with a religious purpose where deposits of offerings to the [[chthonic|chthonian]] gods had been made.{{sfn|Ciuta|Rustoiu|2010|p=110}}

In 2007 a compositional analysis of these gold objects was performed using a non-destructive method, [[particle-induced X-ray emission]] (micro-PIXE measurements) and synchrotron [[X-Ray fluorescence]] (SR-XRF) analysis.{{sfn|Constantinescu|Bugoi|Cojocaru|Niculescu|2007|p=26}} More studies were performed in 2008 and 2009 by a team consisting of members from the National Institute for Nuclear Physics and Engineering, Romania, the National History Museum of Romania, and the BAM Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing, Germany. Researchers compared the gold composition, examining the trace [[platinum group]] elements, [[Tin]], [[Tellurium]], [[Antimony]], [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]], and [[Lead]] and comparing them with the corresponding elements of natural gold from [[Transylvania]]. This was done since these trace-elements are more significant for provenancing archaeological metallic-artifacts than the main element components.{{sfn|Constantinescu|2008|p=1}} For these studies, several small fragments of natural Transylvanian gold – placer and primary – were analyzed using: the micro-PIXE technique at the Legnaro National Laboratory AN2000 micro-beam facility, Italy, and at the AGLAE accelerator, C2RMF, Paris, France; and by using micro-synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (micro-SR-XRF) at the BESSY synchrotron, Berlin, Germany.{{sfn|Constantinescu|2008|p=1}} The studies of the teams concluded that the gold multi-spiral bracelets found between 1999–2001 at Sarmizegethusa had been made of native Transylvanian gold and not refined gold.{{sfn|Constantinescu|Bugoi|Cojocaru|Niculescu|2007|p=26}}{{sfn|Constantinescu|Bugoi|Cojocaru|Niculescu|2010|p=1041}}

Because of the adverse conditions surrounding the hoard's discovery, their origins may never be authenticated to the full satisfaction of archaeologists and scientists.{{sfn|Watson|2011|p=1}} Sceptics suggest that the bracelets could have been produced in modern times from metal obtained by melting ancient gold coins, Dacian coins of the KOSON type or Greek Lysimachus coins; however, the analyses performed so far do not confirm the use of gold from these coins in the bracelets' manufacture.{{sfn|Constantinescu|Bugoi|Cojocaru|Niculescu|2010|p=1038}}

It is most likely that no other group of ancient goldwork has been more thoroughly examined by scientists, technologists and scholars in various countries and various institutions than the Dacian gold spirals with dragon terminals found between 1999–2001 at Sarmizegethusa. In each case-study, and completely independent from each other, their examinations led to the same conclusion.{{sfn|Deppert-Lippitz|2008|p=1}}

The word '''diorama''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|aɪ|ə|ˈ|r|ɑː|m|ə}} can either refer to a 19th-century mobile theatre device, or, in modern usage, a three-dimensional full-size or miniature model, sometimes enclosed in a glass showcase for a museum. Dioramas are often built by hobbyists as part of related hobbies such as [[Model military vehicle|military vehicle modeling]], [[Model figure|miniature figure modeling]], or [[Model airplane|aircraft modeling]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

== Etymology ==
The word "diorama" originated in 1823 as a type of picture-viewing device, from the French in 1822. The word literally means "through that which is seen", from the [[greek language|Greek]] di- "through" + orama "that which is seen, a sight". The diorama was invented by [[Louis Daguerre]] and [[Charles Marie Bouton]], first exhibited in [[Paris]] in July 1822 and in [[London]] on September 29, 1823.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Daguerre#Diorama theatres|Diorama Theatres - Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{fact|date=January 2017}} The meaning "small-scale replica of a scene, etc." is from 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/etymology/diorama Diorama - Word Origin &amp; History] - Online Etymology Dictionary - ''Dictionary.com''. Retrieved 1 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daguerre's and Bouton's diorama consisted of a piece of material painted on both sides. When illuminated from the front, the scene would be shown in one state and by switching to illumination from behind another phase or aspect would be seen. Scenes in daylight changed to moonlight, a train travelling on a track would crash, or an earthquake would be shown in before and after pictures.

[[File:Cooling tower construction diorama.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cooling tower]] construction diorama]]
The current, popular understanding of the term "diorama" denotes a partially three-dimensional, full-size replica or [[scale model]] of a landscape typically showing historical events, nature scenes or cityscapes, for purposes of education or entertainment.

One of the first uses of dioramas in a museum was in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], where the [[Biological museum (Stockholm)|Biological Museum]] opened in 1893. It had several dioramas, over three floors. They were also implemented by the National Museum Grigore Antipa from Bucharest Romania and constituted a source of inspiration for many important museums in the world (such as the Museum of Natural History of New York and the Great Oceanographic Museum in Berlin) [reference below]. 

===Miniatures===
Miniature dioramas are typically much smaller, and use scale models and landscaping to create historical or fictional scenes. Such a scale model-based diorama is used, for example, in [[Chicago]]'s [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] to display [[Rail transport|railroading]]. This diorama employs a common [[Rail transport modelling|model railroading]] scale of 1:87 ([[HO scale]]). Hobbyist dioramas often use scales such as 1:35 or 1:48.

An early, and exceptionally large example was created between 1830 and 1838 by a British Army officer. [[William Siborne]], and represents the [[Battle of Waterloo]] at about 7.45 pm, on 18 June, 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nam.ac.uk/online-collection/detail.php?acc=1975-05-56-1 |title=Model of the field of Waterloo with troops positioned as at 19.45 hours, 18 June 1815. |publisher=National Army Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diorama measures {{convert|8.33|by|6|m}} and used around 70,000 model soldiers in its construction. It is now part of the collection of the [[National Army Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://waterloo200.org/200-object/captain-sibornes-model-of-waterloo/ |title=Captain Siborne’s Model of Waterloo |website=Waterloo 200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sheperd Paine]], a prominent hobbyist, popularized the modern miniature diorama beginning in the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

=== Full size dioramas ===

Modern museum dioramas may be seen in most major natural history museums. Typically, these displays use a tilted plane to represent what would otherwise be a level surface, incorporate a painted background of distant objects, and often employ false perspective, carefully modifying the scale of objects placed on the plane to reinforce the [[illusion]] through [[depth perception]] in which objects of identical real-world size placed farther from the observer appear smaller than those closer. Often the distant painted background or sky will be painted upon a continuous curved surface so that the viewer is not distracted by corners, seams, or edges. All of these techniques are means of presenting a realistic view of a large scene in a compact space. A photograph or single-eye view of such a diorama can be especially convincing since in this case there is no distraction by the [[binocular disparity|binocular perception]] of depth.

=== Uses ===

Miniature dioramas may be used to represent scenes from historic events. A typical example of this type are the dioramas to be seen at [[Norway's Resistance Museum]] in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]].

Landscapes built around model railways can also be considered dioramas, even though they often have to compromise scale accuracy for better operating characteristics.

Hobbyists also build dioramas of historical or quasi-historical events using a variety of materials, including [[plastic model]]s of military vehicles, ships or other equipment, along with scale figures and landscaping.

In the 19th and beginning 20th century, building dioramas of sailing ships had been a popular handcraft of mariners. Building a diorama instead of a normal model had the advantage that in the diorama, the model was protected inside the framework and could easily be stowed below the bunk or behind the sea chest. Nowadays, such antique sailing ship dioramas are valuable collectors' items.

One of the largest dioramas ever created{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} was a model of the entire State of [[California]] built for the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition]] of 1915 and that for a long time was installed in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]'s [[San Francisco Ferry Building|Ferry Building]].

Dioramas are widely used in the [[American educational system]], mostly in elementary and middle schools. They are often made to represent historical events, ecological [[biomes]], cultural scenes, or to visually depict literature. They are usually made from a shoebox and contain a [[trompe-l'œil]] in the background contrasted with two or three-dimensional models in the foreground.

==Historic dioramas==
===The Daguerre and Bouton Dioramas===
[[File:Diorama diagram.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Ground-plan of the Diorama Building, London 1823, by A. Pugin and J. Morgan (illustration reproduced from Gernsheim 1968, p 21)]]
The Diorama was a popular entertainment that originated in Paris in 1822. An alternative to the also popular "[[Panorama]]" ([[panoramic painting]]), the Diorama was a theatrical experience viewed by an audience in a highly specialized theatre. As many as 350 patrons would file in to view a landscape painting that would change its appearance both subtly and dramatically. Most would stand, though limited seating was provided. The show lasted 10 to 15 minutes, after which time the entire audience (on a massive turntable) would rotate to view a second painting. Later models of the Diorama theater even held a third painting.

The size of the [[proscenium]] was {{convert|24|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|21|ft|m}} high (7.3 meters x 6.4 meters). Each scene was hand-painted on linen, which was made transparent in selected areas. A series of these multi-layered, linen panels were arranged in a deep, truncated tunnel, then illuminated by sunlight re-directed via skylights, screens, shutters, and colored blinds. Depending on the direction and intensity of the skillfully manipulated light, the scene would appear to change. The effect was so subtle and finely rendered that both critics and the public were astounded, believing they were looking at a natural scene.

The inventors and proprietors of the Diorama were [[Charles Marie Bouton|Charles-Marie Bouton]] (1781– 1853), a Troubador painter who also worked at the Panorama under Pierre Prévost, and [[Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre]] (1787–1851), formerly a decorator, manufacturer of mirrors, painter of Panoramas, and designer and painter of theatrical stage illusions. Daguerre would later co-invent the [[daguerreotype]], the first widely used method of [[photography]].

A second Diorama building in [[Regent's Park]] in London was opened by an association of Englishmen (having a contract to purchase Daguerre's tableaux) in 1823, a year after the debut of Daguerre's Paris original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midley.co.uk/diorama/Diorama_Wood_1_1.htm|title=The Diorama in Great Britain by R.

The show was a popular sensation, and spawned immediate imitations. British artists like [[Clarkson Stanfield]] and [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] produced ever-more elaborate (moving) dioramas through the 1830s; sound effects and even living performers were added. Some "typical diorama effects included moonlit nights, winter snow turning into a summer meadow, rainbows after a storm, illuminated fountains," waterfalls, thunder and lightning, and ringing bells.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Lambourne, ''Victorian Painting'', London, Phaidon Press, 1999; p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; A diorama painted by Daguerre is currently housed in the church of the French town [[Bry-sur-Marne]], where he lived and died.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.bry94.fr/sites/bry/fichier/diaporama_diorama.pdf All about Daguerre's diorama in Bry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.bry94.fr/bry/2308.htm About the diorama on Bry's official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Gottstein Dioramas ===
Until 1968, Britain boasted a large collection of dioramas. These collections were originally housed in the [[Royal United Services Institute]] Museum, (formerly the [[Banqueting House]]), in [[Whitehall]]. However, when the museum closed, the various exhibits and their 15 known dioramas were distributed to smaller museums throughout [[England]], some ending up in [[Canada]] and elsewhere. These dioramas were the brainchild of the wealthy furrier Otto Gottstein (1892–1951) of [[Leipzig]], a Jewish immigrant from [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's Germany]], who was an avid collector and designer of flat model figures called flats. In 1930, Gottstein's influence is first seen at the Leipzig International Exhibition, along with the dioramas of Hahnemann of [[Kiel]], Biebel of [[Berlin]] and Muller of [[Erfurt]], all displaying their own figures, and those commissioned from such as Ludwig Frank in large diorama form. In 1933, Gottstein left Germany, and in 1935 founded the British Model Soldier Society. Gottstein persuaded designer and painter friends in both [[Germany]] and [[France]] to help in the construction of dioramas depicting notable events in English history. But due to the war, many of the figures arrived in England incomplete. The task of turning Gottstein's ideas into reality fell to his English friends and those friends who had managed to escape from the Continent. Dennis (Denny) C. Stokes, a talented painter and diorama maker in his own right, was responsible for the painting of the backgrounds of all the dioramas, creating a unity seen throughout the whole series. Denny Stokes was given the overall supervision of the fifteen dioramas.

# The Landing of the Romans under [[Julius Caesar]] in 55 B.C.
# The [[Battle of Hastings]].
# The Storming of [[Siege of Acre (1189–91) | Acre]]. (Figures by Muller.)
# The [[Battle of Crecy]]. (Figures by Muller.)
# The [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]].
# The [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] reviewing her troops at [[Tilbury]].
# The [[Battle of Marston Moor]].
# The [[Battle of Blenheim]]. (Painted by Douchkine.)
# The [[Battle of Plessey]].
# The [[Battle of Quebec (1759)|Battle of Quebec]]. (Engraved by Krunert of Vienna.)
# The [[Old Guard (France)|Old Guard]] at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]].
# The [[Charge of the Light Brigade]].
# The [[Battle of Ulundi]]. (figures by Ochel, and Petrocochino - ''pseudonym of Paul Armont''.)
# The Battle of Fleurs.
# The [[D-Day landings]].

Krunert, Schirmer, Frank, Frauendorf, Maier, Franz Rieche, and Oesterrich were also involved in the manufacture and design of figures for the various dioramas. Krunert (a Viennese), like Gottstein an exile in London, was given the job of engraving for ''‘The Battle of Quebec’''. Unfortunately, the ''‘death of Wolfe’'' was found to be inaccurate and had to be re-designed. The names of the vast majority of painters employed by Gottstein are mostly unknown, most lived and worked on the continent, among them Gustave Kenmow, Leopold Rieche, L. Dunekate, M. Alexandre, A. Ochel, Honey Ray, and, perhaps Gottstein's top painter, Vladimir Douchkine (a Russian émigré who lived in Paris). Douchkine was responsible for painting two figures of the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] on horseback for ''‘The Blenheim Diorama’'', one of which was used, the other, Gottstein being the true collector, was never released.

Denny Stokes painted all the backgrounds of all the dioramas, Herbert Norris, the Historical Costume Designer, whom Dr. J. F. Lovel-Barnes introduced to Gottstein, was responsible for the costume design of the [[Ancient Britons]], the [[Normans]] and [[Saxons]], some of the figures of ''‘The Field of the Cloth of Gold’'' and the [[Elizabethan]] figures for ''‘Queen Elizabeth at Tilbury’''. Dr. J.F. Lovel-Barnes was himself responsible for the ''‘Battle of Blenheim’'' diorama, selecting the figures, and arrangement of the scene. Due to World War II, when flat figures became unavailable, Gottstein completed his ideas by using Greenwood and Ball's 20&amp;nbsp;mm figures. In time, a fifteenth diorama was added, using these 20&amp;nbsp;mm figures, this diorama representing the ''‘D-Day landings’''. When all the dioramas were completed, they were displayed along one wall in the [[Royal United Services Institute]] Museum. When the museum was closed the fifteen dioramas were distributed to various museums and institutions. The greatest number are to be found at the [[Glenbow Museum]], (130-9th Avenue, S. E. Calgary, Alberta, Canada): RE: '''The Landing of the Romans under Julius Caesar in 55 BC', 'The Battle Of Crecy', 'The Battle of Blenheim', 'The Old Guard at Waterloo', 'The Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava'.''
 
The state of these dioramas is one of debate; John Garratt (''The World of Model Soldiers'') claimed in 1968, that the dioramas "appear to have been partially broken up and individual figures have been sold to collectors". According to the Glenbow Institute (Barry Agnew, Curator) "the figures are still in reasonable condition, but the plaster groundwork has suffered considerable deterioration". Unfortunately, there are no photographs available of the dioramas. ''‘The Battle of Hastings’'' diorama was to be found in the Old Town Museum, [[Hastings]], and is still in reasonable condition. It shows the Norman cavalry charging up [[Senlac Hill]] towards the Saxon lines. 
'‘The Storming of Acre’'' is in the Museum of Artillery at the Rotunda, [[Woolwich]]. John Garratt, in the "Encyclopedia of Model Soldiers", states that ''‘The Field of the Cloth of Gold’'' was in the possession of the [[Royal Military School of Music]], [[Kneller Hall]]; however, according to the Curator, the diorama had not been in his possession since 1980, nor is it listed in their Accession Book, so the whereabouts of this diorama is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the British Flat Figure Society'': Issue One – April 1986.

===The Frank Wong dioramas===

[[San Francisco, California]] artist '''Frank Wong''' (born 22 September 1932) created [[Dioramas|miniature dioramas]] that depict the [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco Chinatown]] of his youth during the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name = sfchron&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guthrie|first1=Julian|title=Frank Wong recalls life in Chinatown through miniature dioramas|url=http://www.sfgate.com/art/article/Frank-Wong-recalls-life-in-Chinatown-through-5706947.php|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other dioramas ===
[[File:Battle of Midway.jpg|thumb|This photorealistic diorama of the [[Battle of Midway]] was created during World War II on the basis of information then available.]]
Painters of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] era like [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] and [[Francis Danby]] were influenced to create large and highly dramatic pictures by the sensational dioramas and panoramas of their day. In one case, the connection between life and diorama art became intensely circular. On 1 February 1829, John Martin's brother Jonathan, known as "Mad Martin," set fire to the roof of [[York Minster]]. Clarkson Stanfield created a diorama re-enactment of the event, which premiered on 20 April of the same year; it employed a "safe fire" via chemical reaction as a special effect. On 27 May, the "safe" fire proved to be less safe than planned: it set a real fire in the painted cloths of the imitation fire, which burned down the theater and all of its dioramas.&lt;ref&gt;Lambourne, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, dioramas remained popular in England, Scotland, and Ireland through most of the 19th century, lasting until 1880.

A small scale version of the diorama called the [[Polyrama Panoptique]] could display images in the home and was marketed from the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10302430&amp;wwwflag=2&amp;imagepos=1 Science &amp; Society Picture Library: the collections of the Science Museum, the National Railway Museum and the National Museum of Photography, Film &amp; Television]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural history dioramas==
Natural history dioramas seek to imitate nature and, since their conception in the late 19th century, aim to "nurture a reverence for nature [with its] beauty and grandeur".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006; p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been described as a means to visually preserve nature as different environments change due to human involvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-v1.amnh.org/exhibitions/dioramas/ Diorama Exhibition at the American Natural History Museum] – Retrieved 4 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; They were extremely popular during the first half of the 20th century, both in the USA and UK, later on giving way to television, film, and new perspectives on science.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006; p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carla Yanni, Nature’s Museums: Victorian Science and the Architecture of Display, Princeton Architectural Press, New York, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like historical dioramas, natural history dioramas are a mix of two- and three-dimensional elements. What sets natural history dioramas apart from other categories is the use of taxidermy in addition to the foreground replicas and painted background. The use of taxidermy means that natural history dioramas derive not only from Daguerre's work, but also from that of taxidermists, who were used to preparing specimens for either science or spectacle. It was only with the dioramas' precursors (and, later on, dioramas) that both these objectives merged. Popular diorama precursors were produced by [[Charles Willson Peale]], an artist with an interest in taxidermy, during the early 19th century. To present his specimens, Peale "painted skies and landscapes on the back of cases displaying his taxidermy specimens".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006; p. 13-4&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 19th century, the [[British Museum]] held an exhibition featuring taxidermy birds set on models of plants.

The first habitat diorama created for a museum was constructed by taxidermist [[Carl Akeley]] for the [[Milwaukee Public Museum]] in 1889,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006; p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; where it is still held. Akeley set taxidermy muskrats in a three-dimensional re-creation of their wetland habitat with a realistic painted background. With the support of curator [[Frank M. Chapman]], Akeley designed the popular habitat dioramas featured at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. Combining art with science, these exhibitions were intended to educate the public about the growing need for [[habitat conservation]]. The modern [[AMNH Exhibitions Lab]] is charged with the creation of all dioramas and otherwise immersive environments in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York,. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A predecessor of Akeley, naturalist and taxidermist [[Martha Maxwell]], created a famous habitat diorama for the [[Centennial Exposition|first World's Fair]] in 1876. The complex diorama featured taxidermied animals in realistic action poses, running water, and live prairie dogs.&lt;ref name="Taxidermy Art"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Marbury|title=Taxidermy Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CoJLBAAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Artisan|isbn=978-1-57965-558-7|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculated this display was the first of its kind [outside of a museum].&lt;ref name="Taxidermy Art"/&gt; Maxwell's pioneering diorama work is said to have influenced major figures in taxidermy history who entered the field later, such as   Akeley and [[William Temple Hornaday]].&lt;ref name="Taxidermy Art"/&gt; 

Soon, the concern for accuracy came. Groups of scientists, taxidermists, and artists would go on expeditions to ensure accurate backgrounds and collect specimens,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; though some would be donated by game hunters.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Hanson, Animal Attractions: Nature on Display in American Zoos, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural history dioramas reached the peak of their grandeur with the opening of the [[American Museum of Natural History#African Mammal Hall|Akeley Hall of African Mammals]] in 1936,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; which featured large animals, such as elephants, surrounded by even larger scenery.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, various institutions lay different claims to notable dioramas. The Milwaukee Public Museum still displays the world's first diorama, created by Akeley; the [[American Museum of Natural History]], in New York, has what might be the world's largest diorama: a life-size replica of a blue whale; the [[Powell-Cotton Museum]], in Kent, UK, is known for having the world's oldest, unchanged, room-sized diorama, built in 1896.

===Constructing a diorama===

Natural history dioramas consist of 3 parts:

#The painted background
#The foreground
#Taxidermy specimens

Preparations for the background begin on the field, where an artist takes photographs and sketches references pieces. Once back at the museum, the artist has to depict the scenery with as much realism as possible. The challenge lies in the fact that the wall used is curved: this allows the background to surround the display without seams joining different panels. At times the wall also curves upward to meet the light above and form a sky. By having a curved wall, whatever the artist paints will be distorted by perspective; it is the artist's job to paint in such a way that minimises this distortion.

The foreground is created to mimic the ground, plants and other accessories to scenery. The ground, hills, rocks, and large trees are created with wood, wire mesh, and plaster. Smaller trees are either used in their entirety or replicated using casts. Grasses and shrubs can be preserved in solution or dried to then be added to the diorama. Ground debris, such as leaf litter, is collected on site and soaked in wallpaper paste for preservation and presentation in the diorama. Water is simulated using glass or plexiglass with ripples carved on the surface. For a diorama to be successful, the foreground and background must merge, so both artists have to work together.

Taxidermy specimens are usually the centrepiece of dioramas. Since they must entertain, as well as educate, specimens are set in lifelike poses, so as to convey a narrative of an animal's life. Smaller animals are usually made with rubber moulds and painted. Larger animals are prepared by first making a clay sculpture of the animal. This sculpture is made over the actual, posed skeleton of the animal, with reference to moulds and measurements taken on the field. A papier-mâché mannequin is prepared from the clay sculpture and the animal's tanned skin is sewn onto the mannequin. Glass eyes substitute the real ones.

If an animal is large enough, the scaffolding that holds the specimen needs to be incorporated into the foreground design and construction.

In [[literary criticism]], the term '''fabulation''' was popularized by [[Robert Scholes]], in his work ''The Fabulators'', to describe the large and growing class of mostly 20th century [[novel]]s that are in a style similar to [[magical realism]], and do not fit into the traditional categories of [[Literary realism|realism]] or (novelistic) [[romance novel|romance]]. They violate, in a variety of ways, standard novelistic expectations by drastic—and sometimes highly successful—experiments with subject matter, form, style, temporal sequence, and fusions of the everyday, fantastic, mythical, and nightmarish, in renderings that blur traditional distinctions between what is serious or trivial, horrible or ludicrous, tragic or comic. To a large extent, fabulism and [[postmodernism]] coincide; [[John Barth]], for example, was labeled a fabulist until the term "postmodernism" was coined{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}.

'''Fine press''' [[printing]] and [[publishing]] comprises historical and contemporary printers and publishers publishing [[book]]s and other printed matter of exceptional intrinsic quality and artistic taste, including both commercial and [[private press]]es.  Their dedication to fine printing distinguishes them from other [[small press]]es.  Fine press publications are often published in [[limited edition]]s, that are swiftly bought up by [[Book collecting|book collectors]] and libraries.

==History of fine press==

As part of the [[Art Nouveau]] movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Englishman [[William Morris]] wanted to hearken back to a golden age of printing, printmaking, and publishing.  One of the books they published was the [[Kelmscott Chaucer]].  Soon, fine presses began to spring up in the United States as well.  The most prominent was the [[Roycroft Press]].  Los Angeles was a center of the fine press movement, particularly centered on the Ward Ritchie press

{{History of Greek art}}

'''Greco-Buddhist art''' is the artistic manifestation of [[Greco-Buddhism]], a cultural [[syncretism]] between the [[Ancient Greece|Classical Greek]] culture and [[Buddhism]], which developed over a period of close to 1,000 years in [[Central Asia]], between the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] in the 4th century BC, and the [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Islamic conquests]] of the 7th century AD. Greco-Buddhist art is characterized by the strong idealistic realism and sensuous description of [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic art]] and the first representations of the Buddha in human form, which have helped define the artistic (and particularly, sculptural) canon for Buddhist art throughout the Asian continent up to the present. It is also a strong example of cultural [[syncretism]] between eastern and western traditions.

The origins of Greco-Buddhist art are to be found in the Hellenistic [[Greco-Bactrian kingdom]] (250–130 BC), located in today’s [[Afghanistan]], from which Hellenistic culture radiated into the [[Indian subcontinent]] with the establishment of the [[Indo-Greek kingdom]] (180–10 BC). Under the [[Indo-Greeks]] and then the [[Kushan]]s, the interaction of Greek and Buddhist culture flourished in the area of [[Gandhara]], in today’s northern [[Pakistan]], before spreading further into India, influencing the art of [[Mathura art|Mathura]], and then the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] art of the [[Gupta empire]], which was to extend to the rest of South-East Asia. The influence of Greco-Buddhist art also spread northward towards [[Central Asia]], strongly affecting the art of the [[Tarim Basin]], and ultimately the arts of China, [[Korea]], and Japan.

==Hellenistic art in southern Asia==
{{main|Hellenistic influence on Indian art}}
[[File:DemetriusCoin.jpg|thumb|300px|left|alt=Silver coin depicting Demetrius I of Bactria (200-180 BC) wearing an elephant scalp, symbol of his conquest of India, and reverse Herakles, holding a lion skin and a club|Silver coin depicting the [[Greco-Bactrian]] king [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius I]] (200–180 BC) wearing an elephant scalp, symbol of his conquest of India.  '''Back:''' [[Herakles]], holding a lion skin and a club resting over the arm. The text reads: ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΔΗΜΗΤΡΙΟΥ – ''BASILÉŌS DĒMĒTRÍOU'' "of King Demetrius".]]
Powerful Hellenistic states were established in the areas of [[Bactria]] and [[Sogdiana]], and later northern India for three centuries following the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] around 330 BC, the [[Seleucid]] empire until 250 BC, followed by the [[Greco-Bactrian kingdom]] until 130 BC, and the [[Indo-Greek kingdom]] from 180 BC to around 10 BC.

The clearest examples of Hellenistic art are found in the coins of the [[Greco-Bactrian]] kings of the period, such as [[Demetrius I of Bactria]]. Many coins of the Greco-Bactrian kings have been unearthed, including the largest silver and gold coins ever minted in the Hellenistic world, ranking among the best in artistic and technical sophistication: they "show a degree of individuality never matched by the often more bland descriptions of their royal contemporaries further West". ("Greece and the Hellenistic world").

[[File:Indo-GreekBanquet.JPG|thumb|250px|alt=stone relief carving Wine-drinking and music from Chakhil-i-Ghoundi stupa, Hadda, Afghanistan|Wine-drinking and music (Detail from [[Chakhil-i-Ghoundi stupa]], [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], 1st–2nd century AD).]]
These Hellenistic kingdoms established cities on the Greek model, such as in [[Ai-Khanoum]] in [[Bactria]], displaying purely Hellenistic architectural features, Hellenistic statuary, and remains of [[Aristotle|Aristotelician]] papyrus prints and coin hoards.

These Greek elements penetrated India quite early as shown by the Hellenistic [[Pataliputra capital]] (3rd century BC), but the influence became especially strong, particularly in northwestern India, following the invasion of the [[Greco-Bactrians]] in 180 BC, when they established the [[Indo-Greek kingdom]] in India. Fortified Greek cities, such as [[Sirkap]] in northern Pakistan, were established. Architectural styles used Hellenistic decorative motifs such as fruit garland and scrolls. Stone palettes for aromatic oils representing purely Hellenistic themes such as a [[Nereid]] riding a [[Ketos]] sea monster are found.

In [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], Hellenistic deities, such as [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] are found. Wind gods are depicted, which will affect the representation of wind deities as far as Japan. Dionysiac scenes represent people in Classical style drinking wine from amphoras and playing instruments.

==Early Gandhara creations: stone palettes (2nd century BCE – 1st century CE)==
{{main|Stone palettes}}
The Greeks in Asia are well known archaeologically for their [[stone palettes]], also called "toilet trays", round trays commonly found in the areas of [[Bactria]] and [[Gandhara]], which usually represent [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] scenes. The earliest of them are attributed to the [[Indo-Greek]] period in the 2nd and 1st century [[BCE]] (a few were retrieved from the Indo-Greek stratum No.5 at [[Sirkap]]).&lt;ref&gt;Greek Gods in the East, Stančo, Ladislav, Charles University in Prague, Karolinum Press, 2012 [https://books.google.com/books?id=lKJyCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA167 p.167]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Gandhara palette: The so-called palettes or 'toilet trays' of the late second century BC and the first century AD depicting Classical scenes" in The Monuments of Afghanistan: History, Archaeology and Architecture, Warwick Ball, I. B. Tauris, 2008, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;  Production continued until the time of the [[Indo-Parthians]], but they practically disappeared after the 1st century.

==Interaction==
As soon as the Greeks invaded Northwestern South Asia to form the [[Indo-Greek kingdom]], a fusion of Hellenistic and Buddhist elements started to appear, encouraged by the benevolence of the Greek kings towards Buddhism. This artistic trend then developed for several centuries and seemed to flourish further during the [[Kushan Empire]] from the 1st century AD.

===Early contributions of Gandharan artists to Buddhist art (2nd-1st century BC)===
According to some authors, Hellenistic sculptors had some connection with the creation of Buddhist art at [[Sanchi]] and [[Bharhut]].&lt;ref&gt;"There is evidence of Hellensitic sculptors being in touch with Sanchi and Bharhut" in The Buddha Image: Its Origin and Development, Yuvraj Krishan, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1996, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kDyJh--iaL0C&amp;pg=PA9 p.9]&lt;/ref&gt; The structure as a whole as well as various elements point to Hellenistic and other foreign influence, such as the fluted bell, addorsed capital of the [[Persepolitan]] order, and the abundant use of the Hellenistic [[flame palmette]] or [[honeysuckle]] motif.&lt;ref name="Krishan"&gt;The Buddha Image: Its Origin and Development, Yuvraj Krishan, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1996, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kDyJh--iaL0C&amp;pg=PA17 p.17-18 Note 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sanchi====
Around 115 BC, the embassy of [[Heliodurus|Heliodorus]] from king [[Antialkidas]] to the court of the [[Sungas]] king [[Bhagabhadra]] in [[Vidisha]] is recorded. In the Sunga capital, Heliodorus established the [[Heliodorus pillar]] in a dedication to [[Vāsudeva]]. This would indicate that relations between the Indo-Greeks and the Sungas had improved by that time, that people traveled between the two realms, and also that the Indo-Greeks readily followed Indian religions.&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Indian History and Civilization, Sailendra Nath Sen, New Age International, 1999 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wk4_ICH_g1EC&amp;pg=PA170 p.170]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also around the same time, circa 115 BC, it is known that architectural decorations such as decorative reliefs started to be introduced at nearby [[Sanchi]], 6&amp;nbsp;km away from Vidisha, by craftsmen from the area of [[Gandhara]], a central Indo-Greek region.&lt;ref name="AG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HP"/&gt; Typically, the earliest medallions at [[Sanchi Stupa No.2]] are dated to 115 BC, while the more extensive pillar carvings are dated to 80 BC.&lt;ref name="Shaw 90"&gt;''Buddhist Landscapes in Central India: Sanchi Hill and Archaeologies of Religious and Social Change, C. Third Century BC to Fifth Century AD'', by Julia Shaw, Left Coast Press, 2013 [https://books.google.com/books?id=jzkyBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90 p.90]&lt;/ref&gt; These early decorative reliefs were apparently the work of craftsmen from the northwest (around the area of [[Gandhara]]), since they left mason's marks in [[Kharoshthi]], as opposed to the local [[Brahmi]] script.&lt;ref name="AG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HP"&gt;Buddhist Architecture Huu Phuoc Le Grafikol, 2010 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA161 p.161]&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to imply that these foreign workers were responsible for some of the earliest motifs and figures that can be found on the railings of the stupa.&lt;ref name="AG"&gt;An Encyclopaedia of Indian Archaeology, by [[Amalananda Ghosh]], BRILL [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wba-EZhZcfgC&amp;pg=PA295 p.295]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HP"/&gt;

====Bharhut====
[[File:Bharhut Eastern gateway.jpg|thumb|left|upright|At [[Bharhut]], the gateways were made by northern (probably [[Gandharan]]) masons using [[Kharosthi]] marks, while the railings were made by masons exclusively using marks in the local [[Brahmi]] script.&lt;ref name="Boardman 115"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AC"/&gt; 150-100 BC.]]
Craftsmen from the [[Gandhara]] area, a central region of the [[Indo-Greek]] realm, are known to have been involved in the construction of the gateways at [[Bharhut]], which are dated to 100-75 BC:&lt;ref name="HPL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ashoka: The Search for India's Lost Emperor'', Charles Allen, Hachette UK, 2012 [https://books.google.com/books?id=K4vHjbUtf_4C&amp;pg=PT122 p.122]&lt;/ref&gt; this is because [[Stonemasonry|mason]]'s marks in [[Kharosthi]] have been found on several elements of the Bharhut remains, indicating that some of the builders at least came from the north, particularly from [[Gandhara]] where the Kharoshti script was in use.&lt;ref name="Boardman 115"&gt;The Diffusion of Classical Art in Antiquity, John Boardman, Princeton University Press, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krishan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Architecture by Huu Phuoc Le [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA161 p.161]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bharhut torana statues.jpg|thumb|Statues on the architraves of the torana gateway, associated with Kharosthi marks. 100-75 BC.]]
Cunningham explained that [[:File:Bharhut ballustrades with Kharoshti mason marks.jpg|the Kharosthi letters were found on the ballusters]] between the architraves of the gateway, but none on the railings which all had Indian markings, summarizing that the gateways, which are artistically more refined, must have been made by artists from the North, whereas the railings were made by local artists.&lt;ref name="AC"&gt;"These little balusters are of considerable interest, as their sculptured statues are much superior in artistic design and execution to those of the railing pillars. They are further remarkable in having Arian letters engraved on their bases or capitals, a peculiarity which points unmistakably to the employment of Western artists, and which fully accounts for the superiority of their execution. The letters found are p, s, a, and b, of which the first three occur twice. Now, if the same sculptors had been employed on the railings, we might confidently expect to find the same alphabetical letters used as private marks. But the fact is just the reverse, for the whole of the 27 marks found on any portions of the railing are Indian letters. The only conclusion that I can come to from these facts is that the foreign artists who were employed on the sculptures of the gateways were certainly not engaged on any part of the railing. I conclude, therefore, that the Raja of [[Sungas]], the donor of the gateways, must have sent his own party of workmen to make them, while the smaller gifts of pillars and rails were executed by the local artists." in The stūpa of Bharhut: a Buddhist monument ornamented with numerous sculptures illustrative of Buddhist legend and history in the third century B. C, by Alexander Cunningham [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924016181111 p. 8] (Public Domain)&lt;/ref&gt; The Bharhut gateway is dated to 100-75 BC (most probably 75 BC based on artistic analysis).&lt;ref name="HPL"&gt;Buddhist Architecture, Huu Phuoc Le, Grafikol, 2010 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA149 p.149ff]&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure as a whole as well as various elements point to Hellenistic and other foreign influence, such as the fluted bell, addorsed capital of the [[Persepolitan]] order, and the abundant use of the Hellenistic [[flame palmette]] or [[honeysuckle]] motif.&lt;ref name="Krishan"/&gt;

[[File:IndoGreeksTrojanHorse.jpg|thumb|The story of the [[Trojan horse]] was depicted in the art of [[Gandhara]]. [[British Museum]].]]
Later, Greco-Buddhist art depicts the life of the Buddha in a visual manner, probably by incorporating the real-life models and concepts which were available to the artists of the period.

The [[Bodhisattva]]s are depicted as bare-chested and jewelled Indian princes, and the [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] as Greek kings wearing the light [[toga]]-like himation. The buildings in which they are depicted incorporate Greek style, with the ubiquitous [[Indo-Corinthian capital]]s and Greek decorative scrolls. Surrounding deities form a pantheon of Greek ([[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], [[Herakles]]) and Indian gods ([[Indra]]).

=== Material ===
Stucco as well as stone was widely used by sculptors in Gandhara for the decoration of monastic and cult buildings. Stucco provided the artist with a medium of great plasticity, enabling a high degree of expressiveness to be given to the sculpture. Sculpting in stucco was popular wherever Buddhism spread from Gandhara - India, Afghanistan, Central Asia and China.

===Stylistic evolution===
Stylistically, Greco-Buddhist art started by being extremely fine and realistic, as apparent on the standing Buddhas, with "a realistic treatment of the folds and on some even a hint of modelled volume that characterizes the best Greek work" (Boardman). It then lost this sophisticated realism, becoming progressively more symbolic and decorative over the centuries.

===Architecture===
[[File:GandharanAtlas.JPG|thumb|left|200px|alt=he Titan Atlas supporting a Buddhist monument, from Hadda, Afghanistan|The Titan [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], supporting a Buddhist monument, [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]].]]

The presence of [[stupa]]s at the Greek city of [[Sirkap]], which was built by [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]] around 180 BC, already indicates a strong syncretism between Hellenism and the [[Buddhism|Buddhist faith]], together with other religions such as [[Hinduism]] and [[Zoroastrianism]]. The style is Greek, adorned with [[Corinthian column]]s in excellent Hellenistic execution.

Later in [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], the Greek divinity [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] is represented holding Buddhist monuments with decorated Greek columns. The motif was adopted extensively throughout the Indian sub-continent, Atlas being substituted for the Indian [[Yaksha|Yaksa]] in the monuments of the [[Shunga Empire]] around the 2nd century BC.

===Buddha===

[[File:SFAAMBuddha.jpg|thumb|upright|The Seated Buddha, dating from 300 to 500 CE, was found near [[Jamal Garhi]], [[Pakistan]], and is now on display at the [[Asian Art Museum (San Francisco)|Asian Art Museum]] in [[San Francisco]].]]
Sometime between the 2nd century BC and the 1st century AD, the first anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha were developed. These were absent from earlier strata of Buddhist art, which preferred to represent the Buddha with symbols such as the stupa, the Bodhi tree, the empty seat, the wheel, or the footprints. But the innovative anthropomorphic Buddha image immediately reached a very high level of sculptural sophistication, naturally inspired by the sculptural styles of Hellenistic Greece.

Many of the stylistic elements in the representations of the Buddha point to Greek influence: the Greek [[himation]] (a light [[toga]]-like wavy robe covering both shoulders: Buddhist characters are always represented with a [[dhoti]] [[loincloth]] before this innovation), the [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], the [[contrapposto]] stance of the upright figures, the stylized [[Mediterranean]] curly hair and top-knot apparently derived from the style of the [[Apollo Belvedere|Belvedere Apollo]] (330 BC), and the measured quality of the faces, all rendered with strong artistic [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] (See: [[Greek art]]). Some of the standing Buddhas (as the one pictured) were sculpted using the specific Greek technique of making the hands and sometimes the feet in marble to increase the realistic effect, and the rest of the body in another material.

Foucher especially considered Hellenistic free-standing Buddhas as "the most beautiful, and probably the most ancient of the Buddhas", assigning them to the 1st century BC, and making them the starting point of the anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha ("The Buddhist art of Gandhara", Marshall, p101).

====Development====
[[File:PilarImage4.jpg|200px|thumb|left|alt=An Indo-Corinthian capital from the Butkara Stupa from the Turin City Museum of Ancient Art|An [[Indo-Corinthian capital]] from the [[Butkara Stupa]] under which a coin of [[Azes II]] was found. Dated to 20 BC or earlier ([[Turin City Museum of Ancient Art]]).]]
[[File:BimaranCasket2.JPG|thumb|180px|alt=gold relief vessel The Bimaran casket, representing the Buddha, dated from 30–10 BC. from the British Museum|The [[Bimaran casket]], representing the Buddha, is dated to around 30–10 BC. [[British Museum]].]]
There is some debate regarding the exact date for the development of the anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha, and this has a bearing on whether the innovation came directly from the [[Indo-Greeks]], or was a later development by the [[Indo-Scythians]], the [[Indo-Parthians]] or the [[Kushan]]s under Hellenistic artistic influence. Most of the early images of the Buddha (especially those of the standing Buddha) are anepigraphic, which makes it difficult to have a definite dating. The earliest known image of the Buddha with approximate indications on date is the [[Bimaran casket]], which has been found buried with coins of the Indo-Scythian king [[Azes II]] (or possibly [[Azes I]]), indicating a 30–10 BC date, although this date is not undisputed.

Such datation, as well as the general Hellenistic style and attitude of the Buddha on the Bimaran casket ([[himation]] dress, [[contrapposto]] attitude, general depiction) would make it a possible Indo-Greek work, used in dedications by Indo-Scythians soon after the end of Indo-Greek rule in the area of [[Gandhara]]. Since it already displays quite a sophisticated iconography ([[Brahma (Buddhism)|Brahma]] and [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra]] as attendants, [[Bodhisattva]]s) in an advanced style, it would suggest much earlier representations of the Buddha were already current by that time, going back to the rule of the Indo-Greeks ([[Alfred A. Foucher]] and others).
[[File:HanWudiBuddhas.jpg|thumb|170px|left|alt=Fresco describing Emperor Han Wudi (156–87 BC) worshipping two statues of the Buddha|Fresco describing Emperor [[Han Wudi]] (156–87 BC) worshipping two statues of the Buddha, [[Mogao Caves]], [[Dunhuang]], c. 8th century AD]]
The next Greco-Buddhist findings to be strictly datable are rather late, such as the c. AD 120 [[Kanishka casket]] and [[Kanishka]]'s Buddhist coins. These works at least indicate though that the anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha was already extant in the 1st century AD.

From another direction, Chinese historical sources and mural paintings in the [[Tarim Basin]] city of [[Dunhuang]] accurately describe the travels of the explorer and ambassador [[Zhang Qian]] to [[Central Asia]] as far as [[Bactria]] around 130 BC, and the same murals describe the Emperor [[Han Wudi]] (156–87 BC) worshipping Buddhist statues, explaining them as ''"golden men brought in 120 BC by a great Han general in his campaigns against the nomads."'' Although there is no other mention of Han Wudi worshipping the Buddha in Chinese historical literature, the murals would suggest that statues of the Buddha were already in existence during the 2nd century BC, connecting them directly to the time of the Indo-Greeks.

Later, the Chinese historical chronicle [[Hou Hanshu]] describes the enquiry about Buddhism made around AD 67 by the emperor [[Emperor Ming of Han China|Emperor Ming]] (AD 58–75). He sent an envoy to the [[Yuezhi]] in northwestern India, who brought back paintings and statues of the Buddha, confirming their existence before that date:

:''"The Emperor, to discover the true doctrine, sent an envoy to [[Names of India#Tianzhu|Tianzhu]] (天竺, Northwestern India) (Northwestern India) to inquire about the Buddha’s doctrine, after which paintings and statues [of the Buddha] appeared in the Middle Kingdom."'' (Hou Hanshu, trans. John Hill)

An Indo-Chinese tradition also explains that [[Nagasena]], also known as [[Menander I|Menander]]'s Buddhist teacher, created in 43 BC in the city of [[Pataliputra]] a statue of the Buddha, the [[Emerald Buddha]], which was later brought to [[Thailand]].

====Artistic model====

[[File:The Buddha and nude Vajrapani at Jamal Garhi.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Buddha]] and a naked [[Vajrapani]] in a frieze at [[Jamal Garhi]], [[Gandhara]].]]
In Gandharan art, the Buddha is often shown under the protection of the Greek god [[Herakles]], standing with his club (and later a diamond rod) resting over his arm.&lt;ref&gt;Vajrapani-Herakles:[http://www.exoticindiaart.com/artimages/BuddhaImage/greece_sm.jpg Image]&lt;/ref&gt; This unusual representation of Herakles is the same as the one on the back of Demetrius' coins, and it is exclusively associated to him (and his son [[Euthydemus II]]), seen only on the back of his coins.

Soon, the figure of the Buddha was incorporated within architectural designs, such as Corinthian pillars and friezes. Scenes of the life of the Buddha are typically depicted in a Greek architectural environment, with protagonist wearing Greek clothes.

===Gods and Bodhisattvas===
[[File:KushanMaitreya.JPG|thumb|left|120px|alt=bronze figure The Bodhisattva Maitreya, 2nd century, Gandhara|The [[Bodhisattva]] [[Maitreya]], 2nd century, [[Gandhara]].]]

Deities from the Greek mythological pantheon also tend to be incorporated in Buddhist representations, displaying a strong syncretism. In particular, [[Herakles]] (of the type of the Demetrius coins, with club resting on the arm) has been used abundantly as the representation of [[Vajrapani]], the protector of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;"''The origin of the image of Vajrapani should be explained. This deity is the protector and guide of the Buddha Sakyamuni. His image was modelled after that of Hercules. (...) The Gandharan Vajrapani was transformed in Central Asia and China and afterwards transmitted to Japan, where it exerted stylistic influences on the wrestler-like statues of the Guardian Deities (Nio).''" (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p23)&lt;/ref&gt; Other Greek deities abundantly used in Greco-Buddhist art are representation of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], and the Greek wind god [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]]. Atlas in particular tends to be involved as a sustaining elements in Buddhist architectural elements. Boreas became the Japanese wind god [[Fūjin|Fujin]] through the Greco-Buddhist [[Wardo]]. The mother deity [[Hariti]] was inspired by [[Tyche]].

Particularly under the Kushans, there are also numerous representations of richly adorned, princely [[Bodhisattva]]s all in a very realistic Greco-Buddhist style. The [[Bodhisattvas]], characteristic of the [[Mahayana]] form of Buddhism, are represented under the traits of Kushan princes, completed with their canonical accessories.

===Cupids===
[[File:CupidsAndGarlands.JPG|thumb|300px|left|alt=stone fragment Cupids and garlands. Gandhara. 1st-2nd century|Cupids and garlands. Gandhara. 1st-2nd century. [[Musée Guimet]].]]

Winged cupids are another popular motif in Greco-Buddhist art. They usually fly in pair, holding a [[wreath]], the Greek symbol of victory and kingship, over the Buddha.
[[File:CupidsAndBuddha.JPG|thumb|350px|alt=Winged Cupids holding a wreath over the Buddha from Hadda, Afghanistan|Winged [[Cupid]]s holding a wreath over the Buddha (left:detail), [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], 3rd century. [[Musée Guimet]].]]
These figures, also known as "[[apsaras]]es" were extensively adopted in Buddhist art, especially throughout Eastern Asia, in forms derivative to the Greco-Buddhist representation. The progressive evolution of the style can be seen in the art of [[Qizil, Iran|Qizil]] and [[Dunhuang]]. It is unclear however if the concept of the flying cupids was brought to India from the West, of if it had an independent Indian origin, although Boardman considers it a Classical contribution: "Another Classical motif we found in India is the pair of hovering winged figures, generally called apsaras." (Boardman)

Scenes of cupids holding rich [[Garland (decoration)|garlands]], sometimes adorned with fruits, is another very popular Gandharan motif, directly inspired from Greek art. It is sometimes argued that the only concession to Indian art appears in the anklets worn by the cupids. These scenes had a very broad influence, as far as [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] on the eastern coast of India, where the cupids are replaced by [[yaksha|yakṣas]].

===Devotees===
[[File:GandharaDonorFrieze2.JPG|thumb|400px|alt=Gandhara frieze with devotees, holding Plantain leaves 1st-2nd century AD.|Gandhara frieze with devotees, holding [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] leaves, in purely Hellenistic style, inside [[Corinthian column]]s, 1st-2nd century AD. [[Buner]], [[Swat (Pakistan)|Swat]], [[Pakistan]]. [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].]]
Some Greco-Buddhist friezes represent groups of donors or devotees, giving interesting insights into the cultural identity of those who participated in the Buddhist cult.

Some groups, often described as the "[[Buner reliefs]]," usually dated to the 1st century AD, depict Greeks in perfect Hellenistic style, either in posture, rendering, or clothing (wearing the Greek [[chiton (costume)|chiton]] and [[himation]]). It is sometimes even difficult to perceive an actual religious message behind the scenes. (The devotee scene on the right might, with doubt, depict of the presentation of Prince [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta]] to his bride. It may also just be a festive scene.)

About a century later, friezes also depict Kushan devotees, usually with the Buddha as the central figure.

===Fantastic animals===
[[File:Ichthyo-Centaur.jpg|thumb|200px|left|alt=stone fragment An Ichthyo-Centaur, 2nd century Gandhara|An Ichthyo-Centaur, 2nd century Gandhara, [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].]]
Various fantastic animal deities of Hellenic origin were used as decorative elements in Buddhist temples, often triangular friezes in staircases or in front of Buddhist altars. The origin of these motifs can be found in Greece in the 5th century BC, and later in the designs of Greco-Bactrian perfume trays as those discovered in [[Sirkap]]. Among the most popular fantastic animals are [[triton (mythology)|tritons]], ichthyo-[[centaurs]] and [[ketos]] [[sea-monster]]s. It should be noted that similar fantastic animals are found in ancient Egyptian reliefs, and might therefore have been passed on to Bactria and India independently of Greek imperialism.

As fantastic animals of the sea, they were, in early Buddhism, supposed to safely bring the souls of dead people to Paradise beyond the waters. These motifs were later adopted in Indian art, where they influenced the depiction of the Indian monster [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]], [[Varuna]]'s mount.

The later part of Greco-Buddhist art in northwestern India is usually associated with the [[Kushan Empire]]. The Kushans were nomadic people who started migrating from the [[Tarim Basin]] in [[Central Asia]] from around 170 BC and ended up founding an empire in northwestern India from the 2nd century BC. After conquering the lands once inhabited by Greco-Bactrians and Indo-Greeks, the Kushan Empire adopted Greco-Buddhist art.

==Southern influences==

===Art of the Shunga===
[[File:SungaAtalante.JPG|thumb|upright|left|alt=Balustrade-holding Yaksh with Corinthian columns, from Madhya Pradesh|Balustrade-holding [[Yaksha|Yaksa]] with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns, [[Madhya Pradesh]] (?), [[Shunga Empire|Shunga period]] (2nd-1st century BC). [[Musee Guimet]].]]

Examples of the influence of Hellenistic or Greco-Buddhist art on the art of the [[Shunga Empire]] (183-73 BC) are usually faint. The main religion, at least at the beginning, seems to have been [[Brahmanic Hinduism]], although some late Buddhist realizations in [[Madhya Pradesh]] as also known, such as some architectural expansions that were done at the [[stupa]]s of [[Sanchi]] and [[Bharhut]], originally started under King [[Ashoka]].

===Art of Mathura===
{{main|Mathura art}}
[[File:MathuraBodhisattvaSide.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=The Bodhisattva Maitreya, 2nd century,|The [[Bodhisattva]] [[Maitreya]], 2nd century, [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]].]]
[[File:MathuraBuddha.JPG|thumb|150px|left|alt=stone fragment A Bodhisattva, 2nd century, Mathura|A Bodhisattva, 2nd century, Mathura]]

The representations of the Buddha in [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], in central northern India, are generally dated slightly later than those of Gandhara, although not without debate, and are also much less numerous. Up to that point, Indian Buddhist art had essentially been aniconic, avoiding representation of the Buddha, except for his symbols, such as the wheel or the [[Bodhi tree]], although some archaic Mathuran  sculptural representation of [[Yaksha|Yaksas]] (earth divinities) have been dated to the 1st century BC. Even these Yaksas indicate some Hellenistic influence, possibly dating back to the occupation of Mathura by the Indo-Greeks during the 2nd century BC.

In terms of artistic predispositions for the first representations of the Buddha, Greek art provided a very natural and centuries-old background for an anthropomorphic representation of a divinity, while on the contrary "there was nothing in earlier Indian statuary to suggest such a treatment of form or dress, and the Hindu pantheon provided no adequate model for an aristocratic and wholly human deity" (Boardman).

[[File:AmaravatiScroll.JPG|thumb|300px|alt=Greek scroll supported by Indian Yaksas|Greek scroll supported by Indian Yaksas, [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]], 3rd century AD]]
The Mathura sculptures incorporate many Hellenistic elements, such as the general idealistic realism, and key design elements such as the curly hair, and folded garment. Specific Mathuran adaptations tend to reflect warmer climatic conditions, as they consist in a higher fluidity of the clothing, which progressively tend to cover only one shoulder instead of both. Also, facial types also tend to become more Indianized. Banerjee in ''Hellenism in ancient India'' describes "the mixed character of the Mathura School in which we find on the one hand, a direct continuation of the old Indian art of [[Bharhut]] and [[Sanchi]] and on the other hand, the classical influence derived from Gandhara".

The influence of Greek art can be felt beyond Mathura, as far as [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] on the East coast of India, as shown by the usage of Greek scrolls in combination with Indian deities. Other motifs such as Greek chariots pulled by four horses can also be found in the same area.

Incidentally, [[Hindu art]] started to develop from the 1st to the 2nd century AD and found its first inspiration in the Buddhist art of Mathura. It progressively incorporated a profusion of original Hindu stylistic and symbolic elements however, in contrast with the general balance and simplicity of Buddhist art.

The art of Mathura features frequent sexual imagery. Female images with bare breasts, nude below the waist, displaying labia and female genitalia are common. These images are more sexually explicit than those of earlier or later periods.

===Arts of Western India===
[[File:Head of Buddha Shakyamuni LACMA M.79.8.jpg|thumb|left|A terracotta head of Buddha Shakyamuni, inspired by Greco-Buddhist art, [[Devnimori]], [[Gujarat]] (375-400 CE).]]

It has been suggested that the art of [[Devnimori]] in [[Gujarat]], dated to the 4th century CE, represented a Western Indian artistic tradition, based on the influence of the Greco-Buddhist art of [[Gandhara]], that was anterior to the rise of [[Gupta Empire]] art, and that it may have influenced it, and have influenced the art of the [[Ajanta Caves]], [[Sarnath]] and other places from the 5th century onward.&lt;ref name="Schastok 28"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schastok|first1=Sara L.|title=The Śāmalājī Sculptures and 6th Century Art in Western India|date=1985|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004069410|pages=28–31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jh1fF8HvJmMC&amp;pg=PA24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devnimori may also have received some influence from [[Mathura art]].&lt;ref name="Schastok 28"/&gt; At Ajanta, some connections with the art of Gandhara can be noted, and there is evidence of a shared artistic idiom.&lt;ref name="BRILL"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brancaccio|first1=Pia|title=The Buddhist Caves at Aurangabad: Transformations in Art and Religion|date=2010|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004185259|page=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_4pXm7dD78C&amp;pg=PA107|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site of Devnimori included numerous terracotta  Buddhist sculptures (but no stone sculptures), which are among the earliest sculptures that can be found in [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name="Schastok"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schastok|first1=Sara L.|title=The Śāmalājī Sculptures and 6th Century Art in Western India|date=1985|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004069410|pages=24–27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jh1fF8HvJmMC&amp;pg=PA24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style is clearly influenced by the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara.&lt;ref name="JIABS"&gt;The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Volume 4 1981 Number I [https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/viewFile/8536/2443 An Exceptional Group of Painted Buddha Figures at Ajanṭā, p.97 and Note 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Indo-Scythian]] [[Western Satraps]] (1st century CE-405 CE) may have played a role in the transmission of the art of Gandhara to the western [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] region, as may also have the southern expansion of the [[Alchon Huns]] in the 6th-7th century.&lt;ref name="BRILL"/&gt;

===Art of the Gupta===
[[File:GuptaBuddha.jpg|thumb|150px|left|alt=Buddha of the Gupta Empire|Buddha of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] period, 5th century, Mathura.]]
[[File:MathuraBuddhaHead.JPG|thumb|200px|right|alt=large stone Head of a Buddha, Gupta period, 6th century.|Head of a Buddha, Gupta period, 6th century.]]
The art of Mathura acquired progressively more Indian elements and reached a very high sophistication during the [[Gupta Empire]], between the 4th and the 6th century AD. The art of the Gupta is considered as the pinnacle of Indian Buddhist art.

Hellenistic elements are still clearly visible in the purity of the statuary and the folds of the clothing, but are improved upon with a very delicate rendering of the draping and a sort of radiance reinforced by the usage of pink sandstone.
Artistic details tend to be less realistic, as seen in the symbolic shell-like curls used to render the hairstyle of the Buddha.{{clear}}

==Expansion in Central Asia==
Greco-Buddhist artistic influences naturally followed Buddhism in its expansion to Central and Eastern Asia from the 1st century BC.

===Bactria===
[[File:GBA1(trimmed).jpg|thumb|200px|alt=stone Statue from a Buddhist monastery 700 AD, Afghanistan|Statue from a Buddhist monastery 700 AD, Afghanistan]]
[[Bactria]] was under direct Greek control for more than two centuries from the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] in 332 BC to the end of the [[Greco-Bactrian]] kingdom around 125 BC. The art of Bactria was almost perfectly Hellenistic as shown by the archaeological remains of [[Greco-Bactrian]] cities such as [[Alexandria on the Oxus]] ([[Ai-Khanoum]]), or the numismatic art of the Greco-Bactrian kings, often considered as the best of the Hellenistic world, and including the largest silver and gold coins ever minted by the Greeks.

When Buddhism expanded in Central Asia from the 1st century AD, Bactria saw the results of the [[Greco-Buddhist]] syncretism arrive on its territory from India, and a new blend of sculptural representation remained until the Islamic invasions.

The most striking of these realizations are the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]]. They tend to vary between the 5th and the 9th century AD. Their style is strongly inspired by Hellenistic culture.

In another area of Bactria called [[Fondukistan]], some Greco-Buddhist art survived until the 7th century in Buddhist monasteries, displaying a strong Hellenistic influence combined with Indian decorativeness and mannerism, and some influence by the [[Sasanid]] Persians.

Most of the remaining art of Bactria was destroyed from the 5th century onward: the Buddhists were often blamed for [[idolatry]] and tended to be persecuted by the [[iconoclastic]] Muslims. Destructions continued during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan War]], and especially by the [[Taliban]] regime in 2001. The most famous case is that of the destruction of the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]]. Ironically, most of the remaining art from Afghanistan still extant was removed from the country during the Colonial period. In particular, a rich collection exists at the [[Musee Guimet]] in France.

===Tarim Basin===
[[File:SerindiaHead.JPG|thumb|150px|left|alt=terracotta Head of a Bodhisattva, 6th-7th century Tumshuq|Head of a Bodhisattva, 6th-7th century [[terracotta]], Tumshuq (Xinjiang).]]

The art of the [[Tarim Basin]], also called [[Serindian art]], is the art that developed from the 2nd through the 11th century AD in [[Serindia]] or [[Xinjiang]], the western region of China that forms part of [[Central Asia]]. It derives from the art of the [[Gandhara]] and clearly combines Indian traditions with Greek and Roman influences.

Buddhist missionaries travelling on the [[Silk Road]] introduced this art, along with [[Buddhism]] itself, into Serindia, where it mixed with Chinese and Persian influences.

==Influences in Eastern Asia==
The arts of China, Korea and Japan adopted Greco-Buddhist artistic influences, but tended to add many local elements as well. What remains most readily identifiable from Greco-Buddhist art are:
* The general idealistic realism of the figures reminiscent of Greek art.
* Clothing elements with elaborate Greek-style folds.
* The curly hairstyle characteristic of the Mediterranean.
* In some Buddhist representations, hovering winged figures holding a wreath.
* Greek sculptural elements such as vines and floral scrolls.

===China===

Greco-Buddhist artistic elements can be traced in Chinese Buddhist art, with several local and temporal variations depending on the character of the various dynasties that adopted the Buddhist faith. Some of the earliest known Buddhist artifacts found in China are small statues on "money trees", dated circa AD 200, in typical Gandharan style: "That the imported images accompanying the newly arrived doctrine came from Gandhara is strongly suggested by such early Gandhara characteristics on this "money tree" Buddha as the high ushnisha, vertical arrangement of the hair, moustache, symmetrically looped robe and parallel incisions for the folds of the arms."&lt;ref&gt;"Crossroads of Asia" p209&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Northern Wei Dynasty|Northern Wei]] statues can be quite reminiscent of Gandharan standing Buddha, although in a slightly more symbolic style. The general attitude and rendering of the dress however remain. Other, like [[Northern Qi Dynasty]] statues also maintain the general Greco-Buddhist style, but with less realism and stronger symbolic elements.

Some [[Eastern Wei]] statues display Buddhas with elaborate Greek-style robe foldings, and surmounted by flying figures holding a wreath.

In Japan, Buddhist art started to develop as the country converted to Buddhism in AD 548. Some tiles from the [[Asuka period]], the first period following the conversion of the country to Buddhism, display a strikingly classical style, with ample Hellenistic dress and realistically rendered body shape characteristic of Greco-Buddhist art.

Other works of art incorporated a variety of Chinese and Korean influences, so that Japanese Buddhist became extremely varied in its expression. Many elements of Greco-Buddhist art remain to this day however, such as the [[Hercules]] inspiration behind the [[Nio]] guardian deities in front of Japanese Buddhist temples, or representations of the Buddha reminiscent of Greek art such as the Buddha in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]].&lt;ref&gt;"Needless to say, the influence of Greek art on Japanese Buddhist art, via the Buddhist art of Gandhara and India, was already partly known in, for example, the comparison of the wavy drapery of the Buddha images, in what was, originally, a typical Greek style" (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p19)&lt;/ref&gt;

Right: Japanese wind god [[Fūjin|Fujin]], 17th century.]]
Various other Greco-Buddhist artistic influences can be found in the Japanese Buddhist pantheon, the most striking of which being that of the Japanese wind god [[Fūjin|Fujin]]. In consistency with Greek iconography for the wind god [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]], the Japanese wind god holds above his head with his two hands a draping or "wind bag" in the same general attitude.&lt;ref&gt;"The Japanese wind god images do not belong to a separate tradition apart from that of their Western counter-parts but share the same origins. (...) One of the characteristics of these Far Eastern wind god images is the wind bag held by this god with both hands, the origin of which can be traced back to the shawl or mantle worn by [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]]/ Oado." (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p21)&lt;/ref&gt; The abundance of hair have been kept in the Japanese rendering, as well as exaggerated facial features.

4) [[Shukongoshin|Shukongōshin]], manifestation of [[Vajrapani]], as protector deity of Buddhist temples in Japan.]]
Another Buddhist deity, named [[Shukongoshin]], one of the wrath-filled protector deities of Buddhist temples in Japan, is also an interesting case of transmission of the image of the famous Greek god [[Herakles]] to the Far-East along the [[Silk Road]]. [[Herakles]] was used in Greco-Buddhist art to represent [[Vajrapani]], the protector of the Buddha, and his representation was then used in China and Japan to depict the protector gods of Buddhist temples.&lt;ref&gt;"The origin of the image of Vajrapani should be explained. This deity is the protector and guide of the Buddha Sakyamuni. His image was modelled after that of Hercules. (...) The Gandharan Vajrapani was transformed in Central Asia and China and afterwards transmitted to Japan, where it exerted stylistic influences on the wrestler-like statues of the Guardian Deities ([[Nio]])." (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p23)&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the artistic inspiration from Greek floral scrolls is found quite literally in the decoration of Japanese roof tiles, one of the only remaining elements of wooden architecture to have survived the centuries. The clearest ones are from 7th century [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] temple building tiles, some of them exactly depicting vines and grapes. These motifs have evolved towards more symbolic representations, but essentially remain to this day in many Japanese traditional buildings.&lt;ref&gt;The transmission of the floral scroll pattern from West to East is presented in the regular exhibition of Ancient Japanese Art, at the [[Tokyo National Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences on South-East Asian art==
[[File:Bodhisattva Lokesvara statue.jpg|thumb|left|180px|alt=Bodhisattva Lokesvara, Cambodia|Bodhisattva [[Avalokitesvara|Lokesvara]], [[Cambodia]] 12th century.]]
[[File:Avalokitesvara Plaosan.jpg|thumb|right|150px|alt=Avalokiteshvara on the wall of Plaosan temple, Java|Avalokiteshvara on the wall of [[Plaosan]] temple, Javanese [[Sailendra]]n art, 9th century.]]
The Indian civilization proved very influential on the cultures of [[South-East Asia]]. Most countries adopted Indian writing and culture, together with [[Hinduism]] and [[Mahayana]] and [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]].

The influence of Greco-Buddhist art is still visible in most of the representation of the Buddha in South-East Asia, through their idealism, realism and details of dress, although they tend to intermix with Indian Hindu art, and they progressively acquire more local elements.
{{clear}}

==Cultural significance==
Beyond stylistic elements which spread throughout Asia for close to a millennium, the main contribution of Greco-Buddhist art to the Buddhist faith may be in the Greek-inspired idealistic realism which helped describe in a visual and immediately understandable manner the state of personal bliss and enlightenment proposed by Buddhism. The communication of deeply human approach of the Buddhist faith, and its accessibility to all have probably benefited from the Greco-Buddhist artistic syncretism.{{says who?|date=July 2018}}

}}The '''Group of Six Artists''' ({{lang-hr|Grupa šestorice autora}}) was an [[artist collective]] founded in 1975 by the Croatian artists [[Mladen Stilinović|Mladen]], Sven Stilinović, Fedor Vučemilović, [[Boris Demur]], [[Vlado Martek]] and [[Željko Jerman]] in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;Stipančić, Branka: Vlado Martek – Poezija u akciji / Poetry in Action, Zagreb 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In defiance of restrictions set by local art institutions, they performed their pieces in open air spaces using objects such as sun loungers and urban projectors (projecting images onto buildings). They also exhibited in city squares.&lt;ref name="monoskop"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://monoskop.org/Group_of_Six_Artists |title=Group of Six Artists | work=monoskop.org | accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "exhibition-actions" were shown in Croatia and abroad, including the municipal bath on the [[Sava|Sava River]] in the Upper Town Zagreb centre, in Sopot in New Zagreb in the main square in Zagreb (1975), on the beach in Mošćenička Draga (1976), in Venice (1978) and in Belgrade (1976-1978).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mladenstilinovic.com/bio/|title=BIOGRAPHY|date=4 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="monoskop" /&gt; 

These exhibitions would usually last a day and were often meant to provoke.&lt;ref name="monoskop" /&gt; Between 1975 and 1979, the Group of Six Artists performed and documented more than 20 pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryinternationalweb.net/pi/site/poet/item/21773/17/Vlado-Martek|title=Vlado Martek (poet) - Croatia - Poetry International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Group of Six Artists were influenced by their predecessors, the [[Gorgona Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avantgarde-museum.com/en/museum/collection/4511-GORGONA/influence-to-3897-VLADO-MARTEK/|title=GORGONA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, their aim was to provide a different perspective on life and art, expressing themselves freely.&lt;ref name="monoskop" /&gt;

In addition to their exhibition-actions, the Group of Six Artists launched the self-published magazine ''MAJ/75'', printed in the studio of Vlasta Delimar and [[Željko Jerman]]. Eighteen issues of the magazine were printed between 1978 and 1984, and the publication became an additional alternative exhibition space for the Group of Six Artists and other eastern European creatives, including Vlasta Delimar, Tomislav Gotovac, Sanja Iveković, [[Dimitrije Bašičević|Mangelos]], Balint Szombathy, Raša Todosijević and Goran Trbuljak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2011/ScenesFromZagreb/|title=Scenes from Zagreb|work=moma.org|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=[[Museum of Modern Art]]|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hector Pieterson''' (19 August 1963 – 16 June 1976) was a [[South Africa]]n schoolboy who was shot and killed during the [[Soweto uprising]], when police opened fire on students protesting the enforcement of teaching in [[Afrikaans]]. A news photograph by [[Sam Nzima]] of the mortally wounded Pieterson being carried by another Soweto resident while his sister ran next to them was published around the world. The anniversary of his death is designated [[Youth Day#South Africa|Youth Day]], when South Africans honour young people and bring attention to their needs.

On 16 June 1976, school children protested the implementation of [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] and English as dual medium of instruction in secondary schools in a 50:50 basis. This was implemented throughout South Africa regardless of the locally-spoken language and some exams were also written in Afrikaans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://africanhistory.about.com/library/bl/blsaJune16decree.htm|title=The Afrikaans Medium Decree that Led to the Soweto Uprising|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students gathered to peacefully demonstrate, but the crowd soon became intimidated when the police arrived, they then started to throw stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A group of 30 students gathered outside the Phefeni Junior Secondary School singing the traditional Sotho anthem 'Morena Boloka Sechaba Sa Heso'. The police arrived  and  fired [[tear gas]] into the crowd in order to disperse them.  
There are conflicting accounts of who gave the first command to shoot, but soon children were turning and running in all directions, leaving some children lying wounded on the road.

Although the media often named Hector as the first child to die that fateful day, another boy, [[Hastings Ndlovu]], was actually the first child to be shot.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} But in the case of Hastings, there were no photographers on the scene, and his name was not immediately known.

When Hector was shot, he fell on the corner of Moema and Vilakazi Streets, he was picked up by [[Mbuyisa Makhubo]] who together with Hector's sister, Antoinette (then 17 years old), ran towards Sam Nzima's car. They bundled him in, and the journalist Sophie Tema&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 9 August 2002 U.S. lawyer [[Ed Fagan]] led a $50bn{{clarify|usd?|date=May 2018}} class action suit by apartheid-era victims against international firms and banks who profited from dealings with the Apartheid regime.

==Memorial and museum==
On 16 June 2002 the [[Hector Pieterson Museum|Hector Pieterson Memorial and Museum]] was opened near the place he was shot in Orlando West, Soweto to honour Hector and those who died around the country in the 1976 uprising. Funded by the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (R16 million) and the Johannesburg City Council (R7,2 million), it has become a major tourist attraction. The start of the museum begins with pictures of Hector Pierterson's death. The museum fuses memorabilia with modern technology and cultural history. As of 2010, Hector's sister Antoinette, who is seen in the famous photograph, works at the museum as a tour guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Interlochen Center for the Arts''' is a tax exempt, 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation, operating an arts education institution in northwest [[Michigan]]. The center is situated on a {{convert|1,200|acre|ha|adj=on}} campus in [[Interlochen, Michigan]], roughly {{convert|15|mi|km}} southwest of [[Traverse City, Michigan|Traverse City]]. Interlochen draws young people from around the world to study music, theater, dance, visual arts, creative writing, motion picture arts, and comparative arts.  Interlochen Center for the Arts is the umbrella organization for Interlochen Arts Camp (formerly the National Music Camp, founded 1928), Interlochen Arts Academy boarding high school (founded 1962), Interlochen Public Radio (founded 1963), Interlochen College of Creative Arts (founded 2004), and the "Interlochen Presents" performing arts series.

==Organization==

==Interlochen Arts Academy==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
The '''Interlochen Arts Academy''' (IAA), the highest profile pre-professional arts boarding school worldwide, was founded in 1962 by Joseph E. Maddy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.interlochen.org/content/founding|title=Our Founding|website=www.interlochen.org|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2016}}, it had 350 faculty and staff, and approximately 500 students. Admission is by audition only. While more than half the students major are in Music Performance, IAA offers majors in Comparative Arts, Creative Writing, Dance, Theatre (Performance; Design and Production), Motion Picture Arts, and Visual Arts. Newer majors include Motion Picture Arts beginning in 2005,and Comparative Arts in 2011) The vast majority of students at Interlochen Arts Academy are boarding students, including many international students; some are day students who live in the vicinity.

Prior to directional changes led by President Kimpton and beginning in 2009-2010, only 8% of students attended Interlochen Arts Academy for a freshman year, followed by 20% of students for a sophomore year.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} This was due to the school's boarding feature and competitive entrance auditions. With the addition of new majors, IAA has attempted to increase the number of students attending all four years.

IAA also offers a postgraduate year for further pre-professional study.

Upon graduation, most IAA graduates continue to universities or conservatories for further study in the arts or academics. Conservatories that often admit Interlochen students include [[Juilliard]], [[Eastman School of Music|Eastman]], [[Cleveland Institute of Music]] (CIM), [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], [[Curtis Institute of Music|Curtis]], [[New England Conservatory]] (NEC), [[Oberlin Conservatory]], [[Manhattan School of Music]], [[Boston Conservatory]], [[Peabody Institute]], and [[CalArts]]. Interlochen Arts Academy graduates also matriculate at colleges and universities that do not have a primary focus on the arts.

Due to its reputation and secluded location, Interlochen Arts Academy has attracted many celebrity offspring, including children of [[Robin Williams]], [[Hugh Hefner]], [[Bruce Willis]], [[Demi Moore]], and [[Alan Menken]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mynorth.com/2017/07/from-interlochen-to-the-world-famous-alums |title= From Interlochen to the World, Famous Alums Reflect }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Interlochen ca1940s LC 8d07694v.jpg|thumb|Interlochen in the 1940s]]
From the State of Michigan historical marker on Interlochen's Osterlin Mall:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michmarkers.com/Pages/S0225.htm |title=Michigan Historical Marker: Interlochen |work=MichMarkers.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Ottawa (tribe)|Ottawa Indians]] once lived in the pine forest between lakes Wahbekaness and Wahbekanetta. In the late 1800s white men came and cut the pines, leaving only a small forest between the lakes. This virgin pine was purchased in 1917 by the state and became part of one of the first state parks. When the lumber era ended, the Wylie Cooperage mill occupied the Indian village site, making barrels until the hardwood ran out. Willis Pennington's summer hotel, opened in 1909, was popular with fishermen until automobiles and better roads drew them elsewhere. Then in 1918, '''Camp Interlochen''', one of Michigan's first girls' recreation camps, was opened, followed in 1922 by '''Camp Penn Loch''' for boys. In 1928, by arrangement with Willis Pennington, [[Joseph E. Maddy]] and Thaddeus P. Giddings established the '''National High School Orchestra Camp'''. It grew rapidly in scope, size, and reputation, becoming the '''National Music Camp''' in 1931, and affiliating with the [[University of Michigan]] in 1942. '''Interlochen Arts Academy''' was chartered in 1960 to provide year-round training in the creative arts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the book ''Interlochen, The First 25 Years'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1926, Joe Maddy was asked to organize and conduct the First National High School Orchestra for the Music Supervisors' National Conference (now known as the [[MENC: The National Association for Music Education|Music Educators National Conference]]) in [[Detroit]]. Its resounding success led to an invitation to duplicate the experience at the [[Dallas, Texas]] convention of the [[National Education Association]]'s Department of Superintendence in 1927. The exuberant young musicians pled for the chance to work and play together longer than the few days the convention appearance afforded. Joe Maddy promised them a music camp! In June, 1928, at Interlochen, Michigan, in the midst of a magnificent stand of virgin pine trees between two lovely lakes, The National High School Orchestra Camp opened its doors. On leased land, with the old Hotel Pennington, several cottages, 29 new camper cabins, a hospital, water and sewer system, the new Interlochen Bowl, and $40,000 debt, this brave experiment was launched.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Interlochen was the inspiration for the 1941 Paramount motion picture ''There's Magic in Music'' (AKA "The Hard Boiled Canary").&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034275/ ''There's Magic in Music''] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]&lt;/ref&gt; Interlochen also provided inspiration, along with [[Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp]], for [[Alyson Hannigan]]'s character in [[American Pie (film series)|American Pie]].

In 2006, [[Katalyst Media]] filmed a reality TV pilot for [[MTV]] at [[Interlochen Arts Academy]]. Afraid that an MTV show would ruin Interlochen's distinguished reputation, a large group of students resorted to protesting and [[trolling]] the [[Katalyst Media]] film crew in order to prevent [[Katalyst Media]] from filming viable footage. Student efforts were successful, and the pilot never aired.

==Pathfinder School Controversy==
From 2000 to 2007, Interlochen Center for the Arts owned and operated the K-8 Interlochen Pathfinder School&lt;!--do not link as it redirects to the U.S. Army Pathfinder School--&gt; in [[Traverse City]], MI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.record-eagle.com/2007/feb/01pathfinder.htm |title=Interlochen to close Pathfinder School in June |work=Archives.record-eagle.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pathfinder had approached Interlochen about a potential link-up in the late 1990s after Pathfinder encountered financial and operational difficulty.  Believing that operational and creative synergies between Interlochen and Pathfinder might benefit both schools, Interlochen ran Pathfinder School for 7 years.

After Jeffrey S. Kimpton became president of Interlochen Center for the Arts in 2004, Kimpton sought to close Pathfinder School. According to a Traverse City Record-Eagle article, Interlochen initially agreed to invest $250,000 in improvements and pay off $173,000 in debts after taking ownership of the property in 2000 for one dollar. Kimpton's plan was to close the school, sell the property and land (worth millions), and invest the full real estate proceeds into Interlochen Arts Academy. Interlochen only reversed its decision after Pathfinder parents offered Kimpton $3 million in exchange for keeping the school open. Pathfinder, founded in 1972, continues to successfully operate separately from Interlochen Center for the Arts.

==Interlochen Public Radio==
Interlochen Center for the Arts is home to [[Interlochen Public Radio]], a [[National Public Radio]] member station with studios on the Interlochen campus and multiple broadcast locations that allow the station's signal to reach most of Northern Michigan as well as parts of eastern [[Wisconsin]].

When it was founded in 1963, WIAA (note the similarity between the station call letters and the "IAA" abbreviation for Interlochen Arts Academy) was envisioned as a logical extension of the long-running "Music From Interlochen" program that had been heard for many years on the [[NBC]] radio network, and which helped to spread word about the activities at the then-named National Music Camp and the then-fledgling Interlochen Arts Academy.  The station performed so poorly in its early years that there was talk of shutting down the operation.  Today, however, Interlochen Public Radio thrives and includes both a music service and a news service.

Despite being one of the smallest NPR members, IPR boasts one of the highest rates of per capita contributions of any public radio station in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interlochen.org/about/time_line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225091445/http://www.interlochen.org/about/time_line|date=December 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The station's classical service is broadcast from 88.7 FM in [[Interlochen]], 88.5 FM in [[Mackinaw City]], and 100.9 FM in [[East Jordan]]/[[Charlevoix, Michigan|Charlevoix]].  In 2000, it began offering a separate news service on 91.5 FM in [[Traverse City]].  Interlochen is currently investigating acquisition of additional licenses so that IPR can reach larger, more geographically-diverse audiences.

==Interlochen Presents==
'''Interlochen Presents''' has a summer festival running from June through August (schedule announced in April) and a performing arts series from September through May coinciding with the Academy school year (schedule announced in August).  It features concerts, plays, art exhibits, readings, film screenings and dance productions presented by students, faculty, and staff, as well as both well-known and obscure guest artists.  Interlochen Presents events are held in numerous venues around campus.  The list of recent guest artists includes [[Steely Dan]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Joshua Bell]], [[Jason Mraz]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Olga Kern]], [[Sara Bareilles]], [[Dierks Bentley]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Martha Graham Dance Company]], [[Ra Ra Riot]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]], [[Carol Jantsch]], [[Josh Groban]], [[Paula Poundstone]], [[Nathan Gunn]], [[Chris Thile]], and [[Bela Fleck]].  Interlochen Presents and Interlochen Public Radio serve as the primary channels by which Interlochen Center for the Arts connects with the northern Michigan region.

==Interlochen College of Creative Arts==
Interlochen College of Creative Arts was founded in 2004, and offers non-degree arts programs for adults 18 years and over. Most programs are 3–7 days long, and are housed in the Mallory-Towsley Center for Arts Leadership building on Interlochen's campus. The Mallory-Towsley building was completed in summer 2011.

==Awards and accolades==
*'''National Medal of Arts''':  In 2006, Interlochen Center for the Arts was named recipient of the [[National Medal of Arts]], one of the highest honors bestowed by the [[President of the United States]] and [[National Endowment for the Arts]] on individuals or institutions that have contributed substantially to the growth and advancement of the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html |title=Lifetime Honors: National Medal of Arts |work=nea.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304001626/http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html#00 |archivedate=2010-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Interlochen president Jeff Kimpton received the award on behalf of Interlochen Center for the Arts from President [[George W.

Alumni [[Josh Groban]] has also appeared on the series as a mentor.

'''The Jazz Foundation of America''' (JFA) is a non-profit organization based in [[Manhattan]], New York founded in 1989. The JFA's programs seek to help [[jazz]] and [[blues]] musicians in need of emergency funds and connect them with performance opportunities in schools and the community.  The organization works to bridge the gap between social and medical resources and the jazz legends whose careers did not ensure this kind of support.

The Jazz Musicians' Emergency Fund and Housing Fund, established with corporate help, specifically helps freelance musicians who don't have standard benefits, a pension plan or health insurance to cover one-time expenses.  Often, the musicians grow older and due to life tragedies or health problems, can no longer work steadily and find themselves unable to make ends meet.  Musicians can apply to JFA social workers for assistance with rent, housing, mortgage payments, healthcare, and more.  The Jazz Foundation of America has also created a volunteer network of other professionals (and caring jazz enthusiasts) throughout the United States who endeavor to provide free legal, dental, and other health services when needed.

The JFA's Jazz in the Schools program extends through eight states and operates as both a tool for educational outreach and as an employment service.  Jazz in the Schools offers free hour-long performances by recognized musicians, incorporating lessons about instrumentation and jazz music history.  In return, the musicians are paid fair wages by the JFA. The Varis/Jazz in Schools program employs over 120 musicians throughout New York City and hundreds throughout the south, reaching dozens of public schools and hospital schools each month and touching the daily lives of hundreds of school children.

==History==
The organization began with founder Herb Storfer and friends Ann Ruckert, Phoebe Jacobs and [[Billy Taylor]] in 1989. Storfer housed the Foundation in his Manhattan Loft, and funds to support it were raised through tickets to jam sessions in the loft.  Shortly after incorporation in 1990, the newly titled Jazz Foundation of America held a fundraising event at Town Hall, raising over sixty thousand dollars to establish the Jazz Emergency Fund. Shortly after, two established jazz musicians, Jamil Nassar and Jimmy Owens, became the organization's outreach network, connecting musicians in need of rent money or medical payments to the organization's founder.  The committee of founders began to network with other service organizations who shared similar objectives—the Actor's Fund and [[MusiCares]] provided part-time social workers for the JFA's substance abuse programs.

From 1997 to 2000, a new executive director, Susan Cipollone, worked up one or two assessments a day and helped about 35 musicians in a year.  The JFA offered substance abuse programs and began their Monday night jam sessions as a way of recruiting musicians in need.

When the Jazz Foundation became official in 1990, they recruited a 26-member board of directors and associates made up of friends and supportive acquaintances who offered in-kind services, gave advice and volunteered time.  When jazz trumpeter [[Dizzy Gillespie]] died in 1993, one of his last requests was that any jazz musician in need of medical care be treated free of charge at [[Englewood Hospital and Medical Center]]. His initial request was that doctors would provide free treatment to one musician per year.  This evolved into a pro bono network of physicians at Englewood Hospital &amp; Health Center to treat a growing number of musicians. Physicians Frank Forte and Bob Litwick headed up the Dizzy Gillespie Memorial Fund, and the JFA referred clients to the hospital for treatment.  The organization eventually provided uninsured veteran jazz musicians with $300,000 a year in pro bono medical care and operations.

The organization moved into an office in the Local 802 branch of the [[American Federation of Musicians]]. In 2000 [[Wendy Oxenhorn]] became Executive Director and increased the number of musicians assisted from 35 a year to over 150. Oxenhorn set up a fundraising gala at the [[Apollo Theater]] in Harlem, "A Great Night in Harlem" 13 days before September 11, 2001 and, with backing from E-Trade COO Jarrett Lilien, who later became the board president and created its first Emergency Housing fund and built its first board committees. The concert raised $350,000. "A Great Night in Harlem" became an annual spring event at the Apollo Theater. Oxenhorn began to create a supportive network to help prevent musicians from becoming destitute, rather than offering them last-resort funds.

After the terrorist attacks on [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001]], many musicians found it increasingly difficult to find work in the afflicted economy.  The JFA assisted musicians in the New York community, helping to pay mortgages and utilities and finding new venues of employment for the artists.  Oxenhorn's organization was awarded $100,000 from the Music Performance Trust Fund with the help of the Local 802 Union and created school gigs for over 400 musicians in financial difficulties because their gigs and tours had been canceled. The JFA's case load expanded from 35 cases in a year to over 500.

After [[Hurricane Katrina]], Oxenhorn met Dr. [[Agnes Varis]] at a JFA event that [[Richard Parsons (businessman)|Dick Parsons]] was hosting, and told her about the need to help the musicians in New Orleans as she had helped the musicians in New York after 9/11. Varis agreed to give $250,000 to create a Jazz in the Schools program in which musicians were paid fair fees to play one-hour educational performances in local schools.  In this mutually beneficial relationship, students receive a live musical education at no cost to the school, and the musicians are able to earn a living.

Over 20 million dollars were raised since the first concert and over 6,000 emergency assists were possible each year. The Agnes Varis Jazz in the Schools Program grew, and helped hundreds of musicians in crisis, paying them to play jazz and blues music to over 80,000 public school children across America.

==A Great Night in Harlem==
Besides major donors Agnes Varis, E-Trade Financial and [[Time Warner]], the JFA derives much of its funding from its annual fundraiser, "[[A Great Night in Harlem]]," held each May for the past seven years.  This gala event features a sponsor dinner and all-star concert at the [[Apollo Theater]], and has been hosted by celebrities such as [[Danny Glover]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Gil Noble]], and [[Danny Aiello]].  Past performers include [[Odetta]], [[Dr. John]], [[Little Jimmy Scott]], [[Henry Butler]], [[Michael White (clarinetist)|Dr. Michael White]], [[Regina Carter]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Arturo O'Farrill]], [[Candido Camero]], [[Sweet Georgia Brown]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Chevy Chase]], [[Joe Piscopo]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Hank Jones]], [[Dave Brubeck]], [[Jimmy Heath]], [[Paul Shaffer]], [[Jimmy Norman]] and more.

"'''{{Lang|de|Liebestod|italic=no}}'''" ({{IPA-de|ˈliːbəsˌtoːt|}} German for "love death") is the title of the final, dramatic music from the 1859 [[opera]] ''{{Lang|de|[[Tristan und Isolde]]}}'' by [[Richard Wagner]]. 
It is the [[Climax (narrative)|climactic]] end of the opera, as Isolde sings over Tristan's dead body.

When used as a literary term, ''{{Lang|de|Liebestod}}'' (from German ''{{Lang|de|[[Wikt:Liebe|Liebe]]}}'', love and ''{{Lang|de|[[Wikt:Tod|Tod]]}}'', death) refers to the [[Theme (narrative)|theme]] of erotic death or "love death", meaning the two lovers' [[consummation]] of their love in death or after death. Other two-sided examples include ''[[Pyramus and Thisbe]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', and to some degree ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''. One-sided examples are ''[[Porphyria's Lover]]'' and ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]''. The joint suicide of [[Heinrich von Kleist]] and lover [[Henriette Vogel]] is often associated with the ''{{Lang|de|Liebestod}}'' theme.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==In popular culture==
*Liebestod is used as soundtrack to several scenes in the [[surrealism|surrealist]] short film ''[[Un chien andalou]]'' (1929), directed by [[Luis Buñuel]].
*Liebestod is the song playing during the drowning scene in the film ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946), directed by [[Jean Negulesco]] and starring [[Joan Crawford]] and [[John Garfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=vsbonvenutotrilhas|title=Acordes do Coração (Tradução) 1946 Parte 2|date=2012-12-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL7EVfQ97m4&amp;t=27s|accessdate=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Liebestod, Liebestod, Liebestod" is the choral refrain of the song "Love, You Came to Me"{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} from the 1969 [[Off-Broadway]] [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[The Last Sweet Days of Isaac]]'', by [[Gretchen Cryer]] and Nancy Ford. The song is sung by a man and woman stuck in an elevator, as they prepare to make love, believing that they will soon die.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gretchen Cryer|Cryer, Gretchen]] (book and lyrics) and Ford, Nancy (music). ''The Last Sweet Days of Isaac''. New York; Samuel French, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Mild und leise'' is also the title of an 18-minute synthesized composition by [[Paul Lansky]], made in 1973 on an [[IBM 360]] mainframe and based on [[Inverted chord|harmonic inversions]] of the [[Tristan chord]], which was made famous by Wagner's opera. Parts of it became the foundation for [[Radiohead]]'s song "[[Idioteque]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Lansky|url=http://paul.mycpanel.princeton.edu/radiohead.ml.html|title=My Radiohead Adventure|website=Princeton University|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Liebestod" is one of the scenes in the 1987 film ''[[Aria (film)|Aria]]'', featuring a young man (James Mathers) and woman ([[Bridget Fonda]] in her first credited film role) who drive to Las Vegas to have sex and then commit suicide together.
*In "Demimonde," episode 4 of season 1 of Showtime's ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]'', [[Dorian Gray (character)|Dorian Gray]] plays this on a [[Phonograph|gramophone]] for his guest Ethan Chandler, telling him that it is the only cylinder in his collection that he is not yet bored with.
*In Baz Luhrmann's 1996 Shakespeare adaptation, ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'', the opera version of Isolde's Liebestod is the background music played shortly after the death of Juliet (Claire Danes), who shoots herself in the head with Romeo's ([[Leonardo DiCaprio]]) handgun after watching him ingest poison and die; it continues to play during a flashback montage of their relationship during the film, as the camera pans away from the bodies of the dead lovers who are left in each other's arms.
* In Season 19, Episode 2 of [[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 19) |Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]], the episode entitled "Mood", as part of a serial rapist signature, a ritual not necessarily required to commit the crime, the suspect played the song in order to commit the act.
* In the 1944 film [[Christmas_Holiday |Christmas Holiday]], "Liebestod" features prominently not only as soundtrack but as part of the storyline. The doomed lovers meet at a performance of Tristan und Isolde, and in the climactic scene, the female lead holds her dying husband as the music crescendos (4:15 in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeXuhybUac clip from Christmas Holiday (1944)]), obviously recapitulating the action of the opera (although the husband is far from a heroic figure).

'''mTropolis''' (pronounced "metropolis") was an [[open-architecture]] multimedia programming application aimed at enabling rapid development of [[multimedia]] titles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000823023742/http://www.cbd-hq.com/articles/2000/000501gh_mtropolis.asp mTropolis, the Greatest CBD Tool that Never Was] by Glen Hunter, Mojo Productions Inc. (2000, archived)&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by mFactory (pronounced "em-factory") and introduced in 1995. It introduced [[object-oriented]] concepts such as reusable objects, modifiers and behaviors into the multimedia authoring space dominated by [[Macromedia]]'s Director software. mTropolis was bought in 1997 by [[Quark, Inc.|Quark]], which moved development from [[Burlingame, California]] to [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] and then [[End-of-life (product)|cancelled the product]] one year later. Despite efforts by its fervent users to attempt to save their investment and beloved tool, negotiations and even a possible purchase offer never came to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindsay |first=Greg |title=The software that refused to die |url=http://salon.com/21st/feature/1998/06/10feature.html |accessdate=2016-06-27 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000503164742/http://salon.com/21st/feature/1998/06/10feature.html |archivedate=May 3, 2000|publisher=[[salon.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

mTropolis (pronounced "metropolis") competed in the [[Interactive media|interactive]] multimedia product space dominated in the 1990s by [[Adobe Director|Macromedia Director]]. The software's maker, mFactory (pronounced "em-factory"), founded in 1992, variously positioned mTropolis as an alternative and as an adjunct to Director.

mTropolis was bought by [[Quark, Inc.|Quark]] in 1997. The use of behaviors in mTropolis spurred [[Macromedia]] on to introduce behaviors in Director 6.0.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I was there when Seery, Shepherd, meself and probably Greggy went over to the Mtrop user meetings.  We straight out stole [behaviors] from  
them.

- ''Alex Zavatone (ex Macromedia) on the Direct-L Mailing List, Tue, 9 Sep 2008''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While multimedia CD-ROM authoring has largely been rendered irrelevant by online content distribution, mTropolis remains an interesting study in application design, and held a loyal following for many years.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==Paradigm==

The development environment was very different from the other tools around at the time - [[Apple Computer]]'s [[HyperCard]] and others had a card based metaphor, and [[Macromedia Director]] had a film metaphor (the content area is called The Stage, the time line The Score, an assets library named The Cast, etc.). In mTropolis there were sections, subsections, and scenes. Assets would be placed onto the scene, and then combinations of behaviors and modifiers would be dragged onto the assets.

Powerful interaction and animation could be created by making different modifiers send messages to each other, allowing a user to create something impressive fairly quickly, without any typing. There was a simple programming language, accessed via a Miniscript modifier, but most of the programming was achieved by attaching standard behaviors and modifiers, and making selections within the modifier pop-up menus.

==Technical Issues==

According to [[Starship Titanic]] author [[Douglas Adams]], his team had originally selected mTropolis 1.0 for its development platform but it had to be abandoned for unspecified technical insufficiencies in favor of an in-house tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Adams | first = Douglas | title = Why isn't Starship Titanic on the Macintosh? | url=http://www.starshiptitanic.com/game/mac.html | accessdate = 2008-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miniscript Limitations===

One criticism of the tool was that the integrated programming language, Miniscript, was lacking key features necessary for common tasks. Because mTropolis was conceived around a [[visual programming language|visual programming]] metaphor, mFactory engineers intentionally omitted [[control flow|control constructs]] such as [[conditional loop]]s. To remedy such limitations, the third-party developer AX Logic produced the commercially-available Alien Studio modifier as a drop-in replacement for Miniscript.

===File Format===

The advent in version 1.1 of the mTropolis browser plug-in for [[Netscape Navigator]], dubbed ''mPire,'' exposed a core architectural shortcoming. The binary file format was not cross-platform; in order to make a mTropolis element available for embedding on a web page, the author was required to save a Macintosh version and a separate Windows version. Hence the web server had to store redundant copies of the same content, consuming disk space and necessitating the use of loader pages to serve the file appropriate for the end user's operating system.

===Macintosh-Only Authoring===

While playback engines existed for both the Macintosh and Windows platforms, the mTropolis authoring system itself only ran on the Mac.

==Release history==
===mTropolis 1.0===

January 1995: Released at [[Macworld Conference &amp; Expo|MacWorld San Francisco]]. Retail price $4,495.

===mTropolis 1.1===

May 1996: Added support for [[QuickTime VR]] 1.0. Retail price $1,195.

October 1996: mFactory releases beta 1 of the mPire browser plug-in.

===mTropolis 2.0===

March 1997: mFactory announces pre-order sales availability for version 2.0, due to ship in "the second half of May." Retail price $995.

May 1997: Quark, Inc. purchases mFactory.

March 1998: Quark announces that v2.0 would be furnished free-of-charge to registered mTropolis v1 customers, but that the product will not be made available for general purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Landwehr | first = Rebecca | title = mFactory shut down by Quark | url=http://denver.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/1998/03/30/story5.html | accessdate = 2008-06-01 | date=1998-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Titles Created with mTropolis==

Due to the way the mTropolis Player was separate from developer content, by viewing the files, it is easy to tell if a title was developed with mTropolis. A few [[CD-ROM]]s were created using mTropolis, including the [[BAFTA]] award winning [[MindGym]], [[Scott Kim]]'s [[Obsidian (1997 video game)|Obsidian]], A Sharp's [[King of Dragon Pass]], the [[Muppets]] Treasure Island, Voyager's Fun With Architecture and The Magic World of [[Beatrix Potter]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3220">'''Makonde art''' is the [[art]] of the [[Makonde people]].

Makonde art can be subdivided into different areas. The Makonde traditionally carve household objects, figures and masks. After the 1930s, the Portuguese colonizers and other missionaries arrived at the [[Makonde plateau]]. They immediately showed great interest and fascination for the Makonde wood carvings and began to order different pieces, from religious to political “eminences.” The Makonde sculptors, after noticing such interest, decided to carve the new pieces using pau-preto (ebony wood, Diospyros ebenum) and pau-rosa (Swartzia spp.) instead of the soft and non long-lasting wood they had used before. This first contact with the Western culture can be considered to be the first introduction of the classical European style into the traditional Makonde style.Since the 1950s years the socalled Modern Makonde Art has been developed. An essential step was the turning to abstract figures, mostly spirits, [[Shetani]], that play a special role. This shetani style originated in the early 1950s by master carver [[Samaki Likankoa]], whose patron [[Mohamed Peera]], an art curator in Tanzania played an instrumental and decisive role in influencing the modern makonde art movement. Some Makonde sculptors, the best known of whom is [[George Lugwani]], have embraced fully abstract style of carving without discernible figures. Makonde are also part of the important contemporary artists of Africa today. The most internationally acknowledged such artist was [[George Lilanga]].

The ex libris of ritual Makonde art are the unique Mapiko masks (singular: Lipiko), which have been used in coming-of-age rituals since before contact was made with missionaries, in the 19th century. These masks are painstakingly carved from a single block of light wood (usually 'sumaumeira brava') and may represent spirits ('shetani'), ancestors, or living characters (real or idealized). The dancer wears them so that he sees through the mask's mouth and the mask faces straight when he bends forward. Examples of such masks are provided in the second row of pictures below.

'''Mehmed Shevki Efendi''' ({{lang-ota| '''محمد شوقي افندي'''}}, [[Turkish language|Modern Turkish]]: ''Mehmed Şevki Efendi'') (1829 Kastamonu&amp;ndash;1887 Istanbul) (alternative names: Muhammed Shawqi, Şevki Efendi), was a prominent [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[calligrapher]]. He is known for his [[Thuluth]]-[[Naskh (script)|Naskh]] works, and his style developed into the ''Shevki Mektebi'' school, which many contemporary calligraphers in the style take as a reference.&lt;ref&gt;Mehmed Şevkı Efendi'nin Sülüs-Nesih Hat Meşkleri, IRCICA, İstanbul, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Life and career==
Born in [[Kastamonu]], a town near the Black Sea, in 1887, Mehmed Shevki Efendi was the son of Ahmad Agha from Tajc.&lt;ref&gt;"Calligrapher Mehmed Şevki Efendi", [http://www.kastamonur.com/hattat-mehmed-sevki-efendi/ Online:](translated from Turkish); ''Turkish Biographical Index'', Walter de Gruyter, 2011, p. 678&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent to Istanbul at a young age, where he was raised by his uncle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/11/arts/art-review-the-power-of-the-word-in-darting-flames-of-gold.html?pagewanted=3&amp;src=pm|title=The Power of the Word In Darting Flames of Gold|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=11 September 1998|work=The New York Times|page=39|accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

He received his earliest formal training from his uncle, Mehmed Hulûsi Efendi (d. 1894) and obtained a Diploma at the age of fourteen. He was trained in the ''thuluth'' and the ''naskh'' scripts. Later, his uncle wanted him to study with a more experienced master, and sought to apprentice him to [[Kazasker Mustafa Izzet Efendi]]. However, the boy refused to study with any master, other than his uncle. Ultimately, he taught himself advanced techniques from calligraphic works of [[Hâfiz Osman]] and other great calligraphers. By remaining with his uncle, rather than joining a different school, Mehmed Şevkî had the freedom to develop his own style.&lt;ref&gt;M. Uğur Derman, ''Letters in Gold: Ottoman Calligraphy from the Sakıp Sabancı Collection,'' N.Y., Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1998, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; This style became known as ''û Şevki mektebi eb''.&lt;ref&gt;"Mehmed Şevkî Efendi" [Biographical Notes], ''Islam Encyclopedia Online'' [http://www.islamansiklopedisi.info/dia/ayrmetin.php?idno=280533 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; He certified a number of calligraphers, who went on to enjoy exceptional careers including [[Mohammad Hosni]].

Şevkî Efendi was the last in a long line of calligraphers, beginning with [[Sheikh Hamdullah|Seyh Hamdullah]] in the 15th-century, who refined and improved the ''[[thuluth|sülüs]]'' and ''[[Naskh (script)|naskh]]'' scripts. He achieved a "height of perfection never attained previously, nor surpassed since." &lt;ref&gt;M. Uğur Derman, ''Letters in Gold: Ottoman Calligraphy from the Sakıp Sabancı Collection,'' N.Y., Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1998, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  

He taught penmanship in the Ministry of War, where he trained military scribes and also worked in several schools.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S. (eds), ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture'', Volume 1, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 475&lt;/ref&gt; He also taught calligraphy to the sons of [[Abdul Hamid II|Sultan Abdulhamid II]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Uğur Derman, ''Letters in Gold: Ottoman Calligraphy from the Sakıp Sabancı Collection,'' N.Y., Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1998, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;  

He died on 7 May, 1887 following a stroke and was buried next to his uncle, Hulûsi Efendi, in the Merkezefendi Cemetery. He was survived by three daughters and a son.&lt;ref&gt;"Mehmed Şevkî Efendi" [Biographical Notes], ''Islam Encyclopedia Online'' [http://www.islamansiklopedisi.info/dia/ayrmetin.php?idno=280533 Online:]; "Calligrapher Mehmed Şevki Efendi", [http://www.kastamonur.com/hattat-mehmed-sevki-efendi/ Online:] (translated from Turkish)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Metalcut''' was a [[relief print]]making technique, belonging to the category of [[old master print]]s. It was almost entirely restricted to the period from about 1450 to 1540, and mostly to the region around the [[Rhine]] in Northern Europe, the [[Low Countries]], [[Germany]], [[France]] and [[Switzerland]]; the technique perhaps originated in the area around [[Cologne]].

==Technique==
[[File:Kreuzigung (Schrotblatt).jpg|thumb|German "dotted manner" print, partly with added colours, 15th century]]
There were two different techniques for making metalcut prints, with very different results.

The first technique is essentially that of [[woodcut]] but using a thin metal plate rather than a wooden block. The areas not to print are cut away, or hammered back with punches. These prints look very much like normal woodcuts of the period, and it can sometimes be hard for experts to tell them apart.[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/wifb/hod_31.62.9.htm]  The subject matter is almost entirely religious in the early period, which mostly consists of single prints for display or collecting, and mostly ornamental in the 16th century revival, which mostly consists of illustrations and borders for books.  There was a late flowering of the original method around 1500 in France, with a series of lavish [[Book of Hours|Books of Hours]].  In the sixteenth century the technique continued to be used for elaborate borders and initial letters in books, [http://rubens.anu.edu.au/htdocs/bytype/prints/ornament/bytype/display00014.html] notably by [[Jacob Faber]], who often used designs by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]].

The second technique, was introduced in the second half of the 15th century and worked from ''black to white'', meaning that the print showed white lines on a black background, rather than the other way round as in the first technique.  Again prints were nearly always on religious subjects.  Usually the main lines of the figures and landscape were done in [[engraving]]. Then using [[metalwork]] [[Punch (tool)|punches]], the rest of the image is composed of repeated use of the same pattern of punch in a particular area. These might be dots, circles, lozenges, stars, letters making text inscriptions, or more complicated shapes for the borders. Usually very little space is left undecorated; and this technique is easy to recognise.[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090714113905/http://bode.diee.unica.it/%7Egiua/SEBASTIAN/PICS/anon-german.1470.jpg]  These prints ceased to be produced about 1500.&lt;ref&gt;Field&lt;/ref&gt; The plates themselves may have been treated as works of art in plaque form, with printed impressions a useful by-product; in some cases inscriptions print in reverse, though others do not.&lt;ref&gt;Hind, I, 176-179; Field&lt;/ref&gt; Some copper plates survive, often with nail-holes at the corners.
 
As with the other contemporary print techniques, very few metal cut prints have survived. Prints made by the second technique are sometimes called prints in the '''dotted manner''', or ''dotted prints'', ''Schrotblatt'' in German and ''Manière criblée'' in French.&lt;ref&gt;Field&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also possible to combine the techniques on the same plate, with figures using black lines, and backgrounds with punched white dots on a black background. French printed [[books of hours]] from the end of the century often use such combinations.

==Practitioners==
Despite the limitations of the technique, many of the artists who used the second technique were very talented, and the best prints have considerable power.[http://www.nga.gov/cgi-bin/pimage?8323+0+0] Compared to contemporary  [[engraving]]s and [[woodcut]]s, they were usually large, as the technique needed space on the plate. No names are known of the artists; presumably most of them were trained as [[goldsmith]]s, as the punch shapes used were typical ones from goldsmithing.

'''Modern Allegorism''' is a school of [[fine art]] in which the artist uses contemporary elements in an [[allegory|allegorical]] style to communicate a positive and uplifting message to the viewer.

The term was first used in print in a book published in 2007 titled ''Tarnowski: Modern Allegories'' &lt;!-- Published by Masterpiece Publishing, Inc. ISBN #975-0-9790727-0-3 --&gt;about the work of artist [[Glen Tarnowski]]. Tarnowski coined the term to describe artwork that communicated to a modern world in the same way that [[Renaissance]] artists communicated values, ethics and morality to the largely illiterate population of the time.

The three subgenres of Modern Allegorism include whimsical, inspirational/spiritual, and [[paradox]]ical. These subgenres describe the mechanism through which the artist conveys the message. Whimsical modern allegories use humor in a non-critical fashion to encourage the viewer to question their own perspectives and behavior. Inspirational/spiritual modern allegories attempt to inspire the viewer to believe in their own abilities and trust their innate gifts. Paradoxical modern allegories position common elements in ways that are contrary to the viewer's expectation in order to encourage the viewer to evaluate the commonplace and see their own preconceptions in a new light.

A '''movement director''' arranges actors' movements in a variety of production settings that include [[theatre]], [[television]], [[film]], [[opera]] and [[animation]]. Movement directors usually work closely with the [[theatre director|director]] and the [[performer]]s, collaborating with the creative team to realise the physical life of a work. They propose a physical language to performers and directors, and devise training methods or teach skills that will help facilitate a specific physical style. The movement director may create, or research and pass on, embodied information about [[etiquette]], [[ethnicities]] (including [[proxemics]], [[gestural]] language, social codes, etc.), a character’s condition (related to medical conditions within their  historical context, and factors such as inebriation, pregnancy, etc.) and personal journey (ageing, etc.), as well as specialist movement (e.g. period dances, dexterity in falling, lifts and [[acrobatics]], animal work, [[Cross-gender acting|cross-gendered performance]]) or chorus work.

Although [[choreography]] is part of a movement directors’ skill-set, this does not mean that every choreographer is also a movement director. There are also important differences between the movement director and the [[fight director]], where although the movement director will engage with the effect of the relevant weapons on posture, movement and emotional state, the [[stage combat|fight choreography]] itself is directed by the specifically qualified fight director. 
Specialist movement consultants may focus on other specific areas (e.g. as in the work on primate movement by the [[puppeteer]] Peter Elliot in ''[[Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes]]'').

==History==

===Movement directors in Britain===

The role described by the title of Movement director today has been in existence since at least the start of the 20th century, although rarely mentioned in programmes or credits. Movement directors often work at a crossover point, shifting between teaching and directing movement for actors, and have also been termed as Movement coach, Theatre choreographer, or Movement support. 
[[Royal National Theatre|The National Theatre]] created the role Head of Movement that was held by Jane Gibson for a period of ten years. [[Glynn MacDonald]] has been the long-standing Master of Movement at [[The Globe Theatre]], underpinning the work of each season and collaborating with visiting movement directors and choreographers. 
2009 saw an important development in the appointment of [[Struan Leslie]] as Head of Movement at the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]. This was  the only official Head of Movement position within a British theatre company at the time.
Many contemporary Movement directors have established long running relationships with certain companies, with whom they have created a shared body of work and working methodology. These are for example Jane Gibson with [[Cheek by Jowl]], [[Kate Flatt]] and [[Struan Leslie]] with [[Katie Mitchell]] at the National Theatre and [[English National Opera]], and [[Liz Ranken]] with [[Shared Experience]]. 
Other contemporary Movement directors include Michael Ashcroft, [[Peter Darling]], [[Lucy Cullingford]], [[Vanessa Ewan]], [[Lea Hausmann]], Steven Hogget and Scott Graham ([[Frantic Assembly]]), [[Georgina Lamb]], [[Sue Lefton]], [[Ita O'Brien]], [[Liz Ranken]], [[Dennis Sayers]], [[Toby Sedgwick]], [[Ayse Tashkiran]], Sian Williams, Anne Yee, Imogen Knight, Paul Harris, Diane Mitchell, Anna Morrissey, Paul Sadot.

Movement directors today emerge from a rich heritage of movement pedagogues and practitioners. French Director and practitioner [[Jacques Lecoq]], and movement theorist and pedagogue [[Rudolf Laban]] offer important influences. Many of their students and contemporaries became influential teachers of movement and Movement directors in British theatre, often influenced by and interweaving with the lineage of contemporary dance as influenced by Laban, and the heritage of social and cultural dances.
[[Claude Chagrin]], who trained with Jacques Lecoq, was the ‘movement person’ with the National Theatre Company before and while it became permanently resident in Denys Lasdun’s National Theatre Building in 1976.  She was also the first person to be credited for movement, on a production of ''The Royal Hunt of the Sun'' (Dir. Peter Shaffer, 1964).  
[[Michel Saint-Denis]] taught movement in London and was an influential associate director alongside [[Peter Brook]] at the Royal Shakespeare Company from 1962–1966, introducing influences from his work in Paris with his uncle Jacques Copeau.  
Other notable teachers who have shaped British movement work today through a heritage that is passed on from body to body, are [[Trish Arnold]], [[Geraldine Stephenson]], [[Jean Newlove]], [[Litz Pisk]], [[Yat Malmgren]] and [[Belinda Quirey]]. Their work underpins the practice and understanding of contemporary movement practitioners and gives physical life to actors’ performances at Drama Schools and in productions across Britain.

===Contemporary developments===
Movement Directors have sought to be named, in recognition of the existence of their profession, for many decades, and are increasingly gathering recognition. Relevant training for practitioners is now offered through recognized Higher Education degrees focusing on Movement in theatre, such as the MA in Movement studies at The Royal [[Central School of Speech and Drama]], founded by Vanessa Ewan and  Debbie Green in 2004, and now jointly led by Ayse Tashkiran and Vanessa Ewan re titled MA/MFA Movement: Directing and Teaching and the MA in Training Actors Movement, led by [[Wendy Allnutt]] at [[The Guildhall School of Music and Drama]].  Manchester Metropolitan University also offers an MA in Movement Practice for Theatre.  
Movement director and MA/MFA Movement: Directing and Teaching course leader at The Central School of Speech and Drama (CSSD), Ayse Tashkiran, is researching a comprehensive history of movement direction and creating a platform where movement practitioners are able to share their work and facilitate an understanding of their profession by a wider audience.
Industry initiatives to draw out the work of movement directors include the [[Young Vic]] and the [[Royal Shakespeare Company|RSC]] with a variety of workshops, apprenticeships and placements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9189">'''Museum folklore''' is a domain of scholarship and professional practice within the field of folklore studies ([[folkloristics]]).

{{Portal|Folklore}} 

== Characteristics ==
Some museum folklorists work full-time in museums of [[ethnography]], [[ethnology]], [[cultural history]], or [[folk art]], often as educators, [[curators]], and directors. Others work in other settings, such as in [[public folklore]] programs, academic departments, community-based organizations, and consultancies. Such folklorists either partner with museums in the development of scholarly and public programs or study the history and impact of such work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewhurst|first1=C. Kurt|title=Folklife and Museum Practice: An Intertwined History and Emerging Convergences|journal=Journal of American Folklore|date=2014|volume=127|issue=505|pages=247–263|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key themes in museum folklore include policies and practices relating to tangible and intangible [[cultural heritage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China-US Folklore and Intangible Cultural Heritage Project|url=http://www.afsnet.org/?page=FICH|website=American Folklore Society|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intangible Cultural Heritage and Ethnographic Museum Practice|url=http://www.afsnet.org/?page=FICH2|website=American Folklore Society|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; museums as [[sites of conscience]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of International Folk Art (USA)|url=http://www.sitesofconscience.org/members/museum-of-international-folk-art/|website=International Coalition of Sites of Conscience|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; museums and cultural tourism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirshenblatt-Gimblett|first1=Barbara|title=Destination Culture: Tourism, Museums, and Heritage|date=1998|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520209664}}&lt;/ref&gt; and museums as sites of innovation relative to the digital preservation, presentation, and access to cultural heritage collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bol|first1=Marsha|last2=Dewhurst|first2=C.

There is significant interaction and overlap between museum folklore and the neighboring field of [[museum anthropology]], as well as the interdisciplinary field of [[material culture]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berlinger|first1=Gabrielle A.|title=Ethnography as a Strategy in Museum Preservation|journal=Practicing Anthropology|date=2015|volume=37|issue=3|pages=34-34|doi=10.17730/0888-4552-37.3.34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewhurst|first1=C.

Sharpe|location=Armonk, NY|isbn=9780765680525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations ==

An organizational home for the sub-field in the United States and Canada is the [http://www.afsnet.org/?page=MuseumSection Folklore and Museums section] of the [[American Folklore Society]]. Among folklorists, this section is cognate to the [[Council for Museum Anthropology]] among museum anthropologists.

'''Ottawa Festivals''', a not-for-profit member-based organization, is the Festival Network Office located in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]] Canada. Established in 1996, the network consists of 53 festivals in the Ottawa region.

==History==
In the summer of 1994, four new festivals evolved with the objective of showcasing different cultures, arts, and entertainment to the local community. Distinct, yet sharing a common objective, these organizations, namely, Ottawa Bluesfest, CKCU Ottawa Folk Festival, Ottawa Chamber Music Festival, and Fete Caribe, saw a unique opportunity to exchange ideas and experiences and to lend support in each other’s development and growth.

In the fall of 1994, a meeting was called by the president of Ottawa Tourism Commission Authority (OTCA) in response to many public inquiries relating to these new festivals. The goal was to create a communication flow between the festivals and OTCA. During this meeting, there was a consensus that most of the festivals had many common interests and that there was a need to form some ongoing group that could not only coordinate tourism information, but also share ideas to improve their individual events.
After many meetings and brainstorming sessions, the Ottawa Festival Network was formed with an initial board which included prominent personalities like Mark Monahan (Ottawa Bluesfest), Michel Gauthier (Canadian Tulip Festival), Gene Swimmer (Ottawa Folk Festival) and Christine Broughton (OTCA). It was from this initial group that the network flourished and eventually, was successful in liaising with several organizations, such as, Canadian Tourism Commission, City of Ottawa, and Human Resource Development Canada, to name a few.
In April, 1996 the Ottawa Festival Network became an incorporated entity with a group of diverse not-for-profit member festivals representing different cultures, arts, and entertainment.
April 2006 brought a landmark when the Ottawa Festival Network celebrated its 10th Anniversary with the “Launch of the Festival Season”. This event brought celebrated Ottawa’s multi-million dollar festival industry and the decade-long involvement of the Ottawa Festival Network in showcasing and promoting art, culture and entertainment in Canada’s National Capital Region. This event presented the unveiling of the new official name (Ottawa Festivals d’Ottawa), the logo, the 10th anniversary brochure, and the new and revised official Web site. The launch highlighted the growth of the festival industry over the past decade and how it has contributed to the local tourism and economy.

'''''Photoplay''''' was one of the first American [[film]] [[fan magazine]]s. It was founded in 1911 in [[Chicago]], the same year that [[J. Stuart Blackton]] founded ''[[Motion Picture Magazine|Motion Picture Story]],'' a magazine also directed at fans. For most of its run, ''Photoplay'' was published by [[Macfadden Publications]]. In 1921 ''Photoplay'' established what is considered the first significant annual movie award. The magazine ceased publication in 1980.

==History==
''Photoplay'' began as a short-fiction magazine concerned mostly with the plots and characters of films at the time and was used as a promotional tool for those films. In 1915, Julian Johnson and [[James R. Quirk]] became the editors (though Quirk had been vice president of the magazine since its inception), and together they created a format which would set a precedent for almost all celebrity magazines that followed. By 1918 the circulation exceeded 200,000, with the popularity of the magazine fueled by the public's increasing interest in the private lives of celebrities.

''Photoplay'' reached its apex in the 1920s and 1930s and was considered quite influential within the motion picture industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Pamela Hutchinson |title=Photoplay magazine: the birth of celebrity culture |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/jan/26/photoplay-magazine-hollywood-film-studios-stars-celebrity-culture |accessdate=2018-09-13 |work=The Guardian |date=January 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was renowned for its artwork portraits of film stars on the cover by such artists as Earl Christy and Charles Sheldon. Macfadden Publications purchased the magazine in 1934. With the advancement of color photography, the magazine began using photographs of the stars instead by 1937.

''Photoplay'' published the writings of [[Hedda Hopper]], [[Walter Winchell]], [[Hazel MacDonald]], [[Adela Rogers St. Johns]], [[Sheilah Graham]], [[Dorothy Kilgallen]], [[Rob Wagner]], later editor and publisher of [[Rob Wagner's Script]], and [[Louella Parsons]], among others. The magazine was edited by Quirk until 1932; later editors include Kathyrn Dougherty, Ruth Waterbury, and Adele Whiteley Fletcher. It also featured the health and beauty advice of [[Sylvia of Hollywood]], arguably the first fitness guru to the stars.

[[Sidney Skolsky]], a nationally syndicated [[gossip columnist]] for the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' and later the ''[[New York Daily Mirror]]'' had a regular column in ''Photoplay'' called "From A Stool At Schwab’s", the [[Schwab's Pharmacy|Hollywood drugstore]] he made famous, such was the magazine's popularity.&lt;ref name="Sidney Skolsky"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sidney Skolsky|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9034|publisher=Find a Grave|accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lana Turner at Schwab's"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilkerson|first=W.R. 3rd|title=Writing the End to a True-to-Life Cinderella Story : Remembrance: The facts of Lana Turner's discovery at a soda fountain have changed through the years, but the legend remains.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-01/entertainment/ca-19119_1_lana-turner|accessdate=24 September 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1 July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Photoplay Magazine Medal==
[[File:Photoplay-Medal.jpg|thumb|Front of the first Photoplay Magazine Medal of Honor, created in gold by [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]] and presented in 1921 to [[Cosmopolitan Productions]] for the film ''[[Humoresque (1920 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1920)]]
In 1921 ''Photoplay'' established what is considered the first significant annual movie award, the Photoplay Magazine Medal of Honor.&lt;ref name="Photoplay Awards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Photoplay Awards|url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000537/overview|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An actual medallion produced by [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]], it was voted on by the readers of the magazine and given to the producer of the year's best film, chosen with an emphasis on (according to Quirk) "the ideals and motives governing its production... the worth of its dramatic message." Though ''Photoplay'' only gave the single award for best film, its intentions and standards were influential on the [[Academy Awards]] founded later in the decade, and they overlap on [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] choices to some extent, though increasingly in the 1930s ''Photoplay'''s choices reflected its primarily female audience. By 1939 the Medal of Honor had declined in importance and the award was discontinued that year.

From 1944 to 1968, ''Photoplay'' awarded a Gold Medal for film of the year based on polling done by [[George Gallup]]'s Audience Research Inc. through the 1950s, and then voted on by the magazine's readers. It also awarded Most Popular Male Star and Most Popular Female Star based on an actor and actress' popularity, not their performance. The awards were based on polling through the 1950s, and then on a vote by the readers, similar to the Gold Medal.&lt;ref name="Photoplay Awards" /&gt; [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Greer Garson]] were frequently named the most popular film stars during the 1940s and later winners of the title included [[James Stewart]], [[Jane Wyman]], [[Alan Ladd]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Rock Hudson]] and [[Kim Novak]]. Most popular television stars were also named in the 1960s. In 1948, the ''Photoplay Awards'' were broadcast on network television as part of ''[[The Steve Allen Show|The Steve Allen Plymouth Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Steve Allen Plymouth Show|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0864188/combined|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Merger==
''Photoplay'' merged with another fan magazine, ''Movie Mirror'', in 1941; and with ''TV-Radio Mirror'' in 1977, when the name became ''Photoplay and TV Mirror''. The magazine ceased publication in 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5hDG6auRCJ4C&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=Photoplay|title=Inside the Hollywood Fan Magazine: A History of Star Makers, Fabricators, and Gossip Mongers|first=Anthony|last=Slide|date=26 February 2010|publisher=Univ.

Callahan, president of Macfadden, which he had acquired five years earlier, said that the decision to cease publication was made “very reluctantly."}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its staff was moved to ''[[Us Weekly|Us]]'' magazine.

A British version of ''Photoplay'' debuted in 1950, featuring an equal mix of American and British films and stars, and ceased publication in 1989.

{{Refimprove|date=June 2011}}
'''Playwrights Guild of Canada''' (PGC) is a registered national arts service association mandated to advance the creative rights and interests of professional Canadian [[playwright]]s, promote Canadian plays nationally and internationally, and foster an active, evolving community of writers for the stage.&lt;ref name="PGC"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.playwrightscanada.com |title= Playwrights Guild of Canada |publisher= Playwrights Guild of Canada|accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1972 as the Playwrights Co-op.&lt;ref name="CdnEncyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/playwrights-guild-of-canada/ |title= Playwrights Guild of Canada, The |publisher= [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main purpose was to publish and distribute scripts to encourage more productions of Canadian plays. Since then, it has grown and now provides programs and services for playwrights across the country, and now includes more than 900 playwrights. PGC provides promotional and advocacy programs and services for the creative rights of [[Canada|Canadian]] playwrights.

Through its independently run subsidiary, [[Playwrights Canada Press]], which was established in 2002, PGC is a primary source for unpublished Canadian plays, as well as information regarding [[performance right]]s.&lt;ref name="PGC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CdnEncyclopedia"/&gt;

To help support and advance Canadian playwriting, PGC offers the following services to its members:
* Publication of ''CanScene'', PGC's monthly newsletter, which includes calls for submissions, jobs and other opportunities;
* Promotion of Canadian playwrights via print publications, the PGC website, social media networks, and other means;
* Advertising, selling, and distributing published and unpublished plays;
* Administering amateur production rights;
* Facilitating the [[Canada Council]] Readings Program, which creates opportunities for organizations such as universities, libraries and community groups to invite Canadian playwrights to read in public venues by paying the playwright's reading fees and subsidizing their travel expenses;
* Professional development workshops;
* And overseeing member enrollment in the [https://www.afbs.ca/ AFBS] RRSP Investment Plan and the Writer's Coalition Insurance Program.

PGC also publishes ''CanRevue'', an electronic catalogue of Canadian Copyscript plays, on a monthly timetable. ''CanRevue'' promotes new Canadian plays and is sometimes released as a special edition pertaining to genre or geographical region. In 2011, PGC added a section within ''CanRevue'' entitled "Stage Ready". This is intended to narrow the gap between a written work and a production, and allows members to send PGC plays that have not yet been produced, but are ready to be promoted for the stage. ''CanRevue'' is sent out to over two hundred theatres (both professional and amateur) and to schools across Canada.

==History==
PGC had its origins in a meeting held in 1971 by the Canada Council's theatre officer, David Gardner, with [[Carol Bolt]], [[Tom Hendry]], and [[Len Peterson]] to discuss issues affecting [[English Canadian]] playwrights.&lt;ref name="CdnEncyclopedia"/&gt; Those present at the meeting determined that there was a need for a publishing house for Canadian plays. Following the meeting, Bolt, Hendry and Peterson established the Toronto Playwrights Circle to obtain funding for the project.&lt;ref name="CdnEncyclopedia"/&gt; This led to the founding of the Playwrights Co-op of Canada in the following year, for the purpose of publishing and distributing plays written by Canadian playwrights.&lt;ref name="CdnEncyclopedia"/&gt; In 1979, the Playwrights Co-op changed its name to Playwrights Canada, Inc.

In 1977, the Guild of Canadian Playwrights formed to advocate on behalf of playwrights and to lobby for suitable working conditions for Canadian playwrights. In 1982, the Guild of Canadian Playwrights and Playwrights Canada, Inc. merged to form the Playwrights Union of Canada. In 2002, the organization changed its name to the Playwrights Guild of Canada.&lt;ref name="CdnEncyclopedia"/&gt; That same year, it established its publishing arm, the Playwrights Canada Press.&lt;ref name="CdnEncyclopedia"/&gt;

The Playwrights Guild of Canada is a registered [[Charitable organziations (Canada)|charitable organization]]. In 1986, PGC created the Canadian Drama Foundation (formerly known as the Foundation for Recognition of Excellence in Drama)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canadahelps.org/CharityProfilePage.aspx?CharityID=s67275&lt;/ref&gt; as its charitable arm. Part of its funding comes from the [[Canada Council]], the [[Ontario Arts Council]], Ontario Ministry of Culture, and the City of [[Toronto]] through the Toronto Arts Council.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The Guild has a Women's Caucus, which awards the "Bra D'Or" ("Golden Bra") for supporting the work of female playwrights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.straight.com/article-330069/vancouver/touchstone-theatres-katrina-dunn-feted-being-femalefriendly |title=Touchstone Theatre's Katrina Dunn feted for being female-friendly |date=2010-06-21 |publisher=The Georgia Straight |accessdate=2011-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PGC celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2012 with a series of special events, such as a week-long play reading series in May that included Maja Ardal, Drew Hayden Taylor, Hannah Moscovitch, Brad Fraser, and Marcia Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://quillandquire.com/book-news/2012/05/01/playwrights-guild-of-canada-celebrates-40-years-with-reading-series/|title=Playwrights Guild of Canada celebrates 40 years with reading series {{!}} Quill and Quire|date=2012-05-01|work=Quill and Quire|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, PGC opened the Canadian Play Outlet (CPO) at 401 Richmond Street West, a physical bookstore with a selection of over 2000 published and unpublished plays by Canadian playwrights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canadianplayoutlet.com/|title=Canadian Play Outlet|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Canadian Play Outlet|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

PGC has an annual awards competition with several categories: Lifetime Membership, Honorary Membership, Post-Secondary Competition, the Bra D'Or Award, Carol Bolt Award for Playwrights, Stage West Pechet Family Comedy Award, and [[Stage West Pechet Family Musical Award]]. The awards were recently named the Tom Hendry Awards after Tom Hendry, a founding member of PGC who died in 2012. The awards carry generous cash prizes and winners are recognized in a ceremony occurring in the fall each year. Deadlines for the awards are April 30 and May 31.

As in previous years, in the future the awards ceremony will continue to forge relationships with other arts organizations and corporate sponsors, celebrating excellence in Canadian playwriting.

}}'''''Pornocrates''''', '''''Pornokratès''''', '''''La dame au cochon''''', or '''''The Lady with the Pig''''' is a work by the Belgian artist [[Félicien Rops]], created in 1878. It is part of the collection of the Musée provincial Félicien Rops in [[Namur]], Belgium.

The work in Namur is 75&amp;nbsp;cm high and 48&amp;nbsp;cm wide, executed in [[gouache]] and [[Watercolor painting|watercolor paint]] heightened with [[pastel]] on paper. Reproductions of the work ([[soft-ground etching]]s, [[Photogravure|heliogravures]] and [[aquatint]]s, sometimes colored) are also present in other museum collections, such as the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|LACMA]], the [[National Museum of Western Art]] and the [[Rijksmuseum|Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]].

== Description ==
''Pornocrates'' is considered the best-known work by Rops.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museerops.be/oeuvre/2006042001/|title=Pornocratès, 1878|last=Leblanc|first=Véronique|date=20 April 2006|website=Musée provincial Félicien Rops Namur|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was realized at a time when Rops was 45 years old and lived in Paris together with the sisters Léontine and Aurélie Duluc, who both were his [[Mistress (lover)|mistresses]] and became mothers to his children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lesoir.be/1135786/article/soirmag/soirmag-histoire/2016-02-29/felicien-rops-pornokrates|title=Félicien Rops: Pornokratès|last=Smets|first=Joëlle|date=3 March 2016|website=lesoir.be|publisher=Le Soir|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the work can be translated as "the ruler of [[fornication]]". According to his own correspondence, Rops produced this painting "in an overheated apartment, full of different smells, where the [[Opopanax (plant)|opopanax]] and [[cyclamen]] gave me a slight fever conductive towards production or even towards reproduction".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Letter from Félicien Rops to H. Liesse, 1879.&lt;/ref&gt; The work depicts a woman, holding a [[Domestic pig|swine]] on a leash, viewed from the left side. The woman, said to be a [[courtesan]], is almost naked, with the exception of long black silk gloves, a [[blindfold]], a plumed hat, black shoes and stockings, and a band of gold and blue silk – accessories which only emphasize her nakedness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAsiQA7msZE Felicien Rops Pornocrates] – YouTube video with interpretation of the work&lt;/ref&gt; Above the pig with golden tail, three winged [[Putto|putti]] fly away in what looks like shock or horror. Rops refers to them as "Three loves – ancient loves – vanish in tears".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Meaning of the work ==
Various interpretations for the work exist. The woman can be seen as a powerful female, led by the hog, which can be seen as an image of man, in a bestial, submissive and ignorant state, kept in check by the woman. The pig with golden tail can also be seen as an [[allegory]] for [[Luxury goods|luxury]], or even as an animal of the [[devil]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; a symbol of fornication, steering the woman in [[Visual impairment|blindness]]. In any case the work represents Rops' vision of the woman of his time: a ''[[femme fatale]]'' who was increasingly [[Assertiveness|assertive]], ruthless and [[Seduction|seductive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rijksmuseumamsterdam.blogspot.nl/2013/02/felicien-rops-pornocrates-1878-musee.html|title=Félicien Rops: Pornocrates (1878); Musée Félicien Rops, Namur|last=Dorhout|first=Pauline|date=10 February 2013|website=The World According to Art|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; "She was the human animal viciously depicted by Félicien Rops as "Pornokrates", ruler of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon's]] "Pornocracy", a creature blindly guided by a hog, the symbol of [[Circe]], the bestial representative of all sexual evil".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Idols of Perversity.

[[File:Félicien Rops - Pornokratès - 1878 - Frieze with the Arts.jpg|left|thumb|500x500px|Frieze with the Arts]]
The woman and pig are walking on top of a [[marble]] stage,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museerops.be/tech/drawing/pornokrates.html|title=Drawing – Pornokratès|last=|first=|date=|website=Musée Félicien Rops|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a frieze depicting four allegories of the arts: sculpture, music, literature and painting. The fine arts are depicted as grey, [[Classics|classical]] male figures, looking desperate. This might be interpreted as the victory of sensuousness and eroticism of the art that Rops and his contemporaries of the [[Decadent movement]] created, in contrast with the boredom of the [[academic art]] of that era.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The title may also refer to the concept of [[Saeculum obscurum|pornocracy]], a period in the [[History of the papacy]] during the first half of the 10th Century where the Popes were strongy influenced by a corrupt aristocratic family, the [[Counts of Tusculum|Theophylacti]]. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon published his [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]] tract ''La Pornocratie ou les femmes dans les temps modernes'' in 1875, three years before Rops worked on his ''Pornocrates''.

An early owner of the work was the Belgian jurist and art collector [[Edmond Picard]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; ''Pornocrates'' was received with indignation and scandal during the 1886 exhibition of the [[Les XX|Cercle des XX]], an art group to which Rops belonged.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.numeriques.be/index.php?id=6&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_portailnumeriques_pi1%5Bview%5D=item_detail&amp;tx_portailnumeriques_pi1%5Bid%5D=peps%3AMAR-ROPS-APC193&amp;tx_portailnumeriques_pi1%5Bnum%5D=3|title=Pornokratès ou La Femme au cochon|last=|first=|date=|website=numeriques.be|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Buscando la luz IV'' by Eduardo Chillida==
Qatar Museums unveils Public Art commission by the Basque artist [[Eduardo Chillida]] at [[Qatar University]], Doha, [[Qatar]]. ''Buscando la luz IV'' (Searching for Light IV) is the last among a series of sculptures of monumental scale produced by Chillida throughout his final creative period. The abstract piece integrates in itself the fundamental concepts inside the artist’s labor. The dialogue between matter and space; the creation of sites; the organic nature of forms; and a strong ethical content are all notions that conform Chillida’s body of work. The three asymmetrical steel plates that compose the sculpture are linked to each other through a complex riveting system, which delimitates in its interior a place for human encounters. The artist plays with the scale and invites us to enter the interior space of the work. Once inside, its undulant forms appear to acquire movement, raising up in search of the light.

'''Readgeek''' is an online book [[recommendations engine]] and [[social cataloging]] service launched in December 2010. The website allows users to search for books matching their individual taste making use of several [[algorithm]]s. Taking ratings and [[metadata]] of prior read books into account, those algorithms help the site to learn about a users preferences. The service suggests books other users with similar tastes have enjoyed, rather than offering up books similar to the ones a user already ranked.&lt;ref name=bu&gt;{{Cite news| author=

'''Reverse chronology''' is a method of story-telling whereby the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] is revealed in reverse order.

In a story employing this technique, the first [[Scene (fiction)|scene]] shown is actually the conclusion to the plot. Once that scene ends, the penultimate scene is shown, and so on, so that the final scene the viewer sees is the first chronologically.

Many stories employ [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], showing prior events, but whereas the scene order of most conventional films is A-B-C-etc., a film in reverse chronology goes Z-Y-X-etc.

As a hypothetical example, if the [[fairy tale]] ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' was told using reverse chronology, the opening scene would depict Jack chopping the beanstalk down and killing the giant. The next scene would feature Jack being discovered by the giant and climbing down the beanstalk in fear of his life. Later, we would see Jack running into the man with the infamous magic beans, then, at the end of the film, being sent off by his mother to sell the cow.

== Purpose ==
The unusual nature of this method means it is only used in stories of a specific nature. For example, ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' features a man with [[anterograde amnesia]], meaning he is unable to form new memories. The film parallels the protagonist's perspective by unfolding in reverse chronological order, leaving the audience as ignorant of the events that occurred prior to each scene (which, played in reverse chronological order, will not be revealed until later) as the protagonist is.

In the film ''[[Irréversible]],'' an act of [[homicide|homicidal]] violence takes place at the start of the movie (i. e., it is the final event to take place). During the remainder of the film we learn not only that the violence is an act of vengeance, but what exactly is being avenged. The film was highly controversial for its graphic nature; had the scenes been shown in chronological order, this violent content would make it a simple, and pointlessly brutal, revenge movie. However, as it is, told in reverse, the audience is made to consider the exact consequences of each action, and there is often "more than meets the eye."

== Examples of use ==

=== Literature ===
The epic poem ''[[Aeneid]]'', written by [[Virgil]] in the 1st century BC, uses reverse chronology within scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht, Michael von; &amp; Schmeling, Gareth L. (1997). '' History of Roman Literature: From Livius Andronicus to Boethius, Vol. 1''. Brill. p. 681. {{ISBN|90-04-09630-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[The Three Apples]]", a [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]] in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', the middle part of the story shows a flashback of events leading up to the discovery of a dead body at the beginning of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=86–94|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action of [[W. R. Burnett]]'s novel, ''Goodbye to the Past'' (1934), moves continually from 1929 to 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Bordwell, David (April 2006). ''The Way Hollywood Tells It: Story and Style in Modern Movies''. [[University of California Press]]. p. 91. {{ISBN|0-520-24622-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Long View'' (1956) by [[Elizabeth Jane Howard]] describes a marriage in reverse chronology from 1950s London back to its beginning in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/30/hilary-mantel-elizabeth-jane-howard-novelist Hilary Mantel in The Guardian, 30 January 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Lewis Wallant]] uses flashbacks in reverse chronology in ''The Human Season'' (1960).&lt;ref&gt;Serafin, Steven; &amp; Bendixen, Alfred (2003). ''The Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature''. [[Continuum International Publishing Group]].  p. 1189. {{ISBN|0-8264-1517-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel ''Christopher Homm'' (1965), by [[C. H. Sisson]], is also told in reverse chronology.&lt;ref&gt;Head, Dominic (2006). ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English''. [[Cambridge University Press]]. p. 1036. {{ISBN|0-521-83179-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip K. Dick]], in his 1967 novel ''[[Counter-Clock World]]'', describes a future in which time has started to move in reverse, resulting in the dead reviving in their own graves ("old-birth"), living their lives in reverse, eventually ending in returning to the womb, and splitting into an egg and a sperm during copulation between a recipient woman and a man. The novel was expanded from Dick's short story "Your Appointment Will Be Yesterday", first published in the August 1966 edition of [[Amazing Stories]].

[[Martin Amis]]'s 1991 novel ''[[Time's Arrow (novel)|Time's Arrow]]'' tells the story of a man who, it seems, brings dead people to life. Eventually it is revealed that the story is being seen backwards, and he was a doctor at [[Auschwitz]] who brought death to live people. He escaped to the United States, and the novel starts with his death and ends with his birth. Amis writes in the Afterword that he had a "certain paragraph" from [[Kurt Vonnegut|Kurt Vonnegut's]] ''[[Slaughterhouse Five]]'' (1969) in mind.  As he waits to be taken by aliens to the planet Tralfamadore, the protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, watches a war movie backwards. American planes full of holes fly backwards as German planes suck bullets from them; bombers take their bombs back to base where they are returned to the States, reduced to ore and buried. The American fliers became high school kids again, and, Billy guesses, Hitler ultimately returns to babyhood.

[[Iain M. Banks|Iain Banks]]'s novel ''[[Use of Weapons]]'' interweaves two parallel stories, one told in standard chronology and one in reverse, both concluding at a critical moment in the main character's life.

[[Julia Alvarez]]'s novel ''[[How the García Girls Lost Their Accents]]'' opens in 1989 with one of the characters returning to her native Dominican Republic. The story of why the family left and their attempts to succeed in New York are told in reverse chronological order, with the last events happening in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arls.org/2011/11/arls-teen-book-review-how-the-garcia-girls-lost-their-accents/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theatre ===
A number of [[Play (theatre)|plays]] have employed this technique. [[George S. Kaufman]] and [[Moss Hart|Moss Hart's]] 1934 play, ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (play)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'', is told in reverse order, as is the [[Harold Pinter]] play ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' (1978). Kaufman and Hart's play was adapted as [[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|a musical comedy by Stephen Sondheim]] in 1981, and Pinter's play was made into [[Betrayal (1983 film)|a film]] in 1983.

=== Film ===
In 1927, [[Jean Epstein]]'s ''La glace à trois faces'' (''The Three Sided Mirror'') features a sequence where the events happen in reverse, beginning with the protagonist's exit from a room until the viewer sees the entrance. The Czech comedy ''[[Happy End (1966 film)|Happy End]]'' (1966) is a farce which starts with a guillotined man finding his head popped back on his shoulders and ends with him as a new-born being pushed back into his mother's womb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,841358,00.html | work=Time | title=Cinema: Happy End | date=1968-06-28 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atom Egoyan]], influenced by Pinter's plays, tells the story of ''[[The Sweet Hereafter (film)|The Sweet Hereafter]]'' (1997) in reverse chronology, with the first scene of the film set in 1977 and the last in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;MacDermott, Felim; &amp; McGrath, Declan (2003). ''Screenwriting''. [[Focal Press]]. p. 172. {{ISBN|0-240-80512-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The technique was later employed in ''[[Peppermint Candy]]'' (2000), by [[South Korea]]n director [[Lee Chang-dong]]; in ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' (2000), a mystery directed by [[Christopher Nolan]] about short term memory loss; and in [[Jean-Luc Godard|Jean-Luc Godard's]] short film ''De l'origine du XXIe siècle pour moi'' (2000).&lt;ref name="Gateward"&gt;Gateward, Frances K. (2007). ''Seoul Searching: Culture and Identity in Contemporary Korean Cinema''. [[SUNY Press]]. p. 136. {{ISBN|0-7914-7225-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Irréversible]]'' (2002), the technique is used so thoroughly that the [[Closing credits|end credits]] are not only shown at the beginning of the movie, but they roll ''down'' the screen, rather than upwards as is familiar.

The first several scenes in 2003's film ''[[Identity (film)|Identity]]'', starring [[John Cusack]], occur in reverse order.

The 2004 film ''[[5x2]]'', directed by [[François Ozon]], tells the story of a relationship between two people in five episodes using reverse chronology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=313595 | work=The New York Times | first=A. O. | last=Scott | accessdate=2010-05-22 | title=We're Sorry | date=2005-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'' (2004), a main substory is told in reverse.

''Coup de Sang'', a French film by Jean Marboeuf (2006), uses limited reverse chronology. The film begins with the revelation that the main character will commit a murder one week from the next scene, although it is not revealed who will be killed or why.

In the 2007 movie ''[[P.S. I Love You (film)|P.S. I Love You]]'', the scenes in which Gerry Kennedy ([[Gerard Butler]]) meets and courts Holly ([[Hilary Swank]]) are shown in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/P-S-I-Love-You-2797.html |author= Calamari, Alexandra |date= 2007 |title= ''P.S. I Love You'' |publisher= Cinema Blend |accessdate= July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 Tamil movie, ''[[Manmadan Ambu (film)|Manmadan Ambu]]'', the song "Neela Vaanam" (visuals inspired by [[Coldplay]]'s "[[The Scientist (song)|The Scientist]]") is shown in a reverse sequence.

=== Television ===
{{See also|The Backwards Episode}}

The made-for-television drama ''[[Two Friends (1986 film)|''Two Friends'']]'' (1986), by [[Jane Campion]], and the 1997 episode, "[[The Betrayal]]", of the hit sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'', employs the technique. The ''Seinfeld'' episode is a take-off of the Harold Pinter play ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' and has a character named "Pinter."&lt;ref name="Gateward"/&gt;  [[Redrum (The X-Files)|"Redrum"]], a 2000 episode of ''[[The X-Files]],'' uses the technique in focusing on a character experiencing the events in reverse along with the audience. The 2002 ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' episode "Hindsight" uses reverse chronology to illustrate the events leading to traumatic car accident. A 1997 [[Star Trek: Voyager|''Star Trek: Voyager'']] episode, "[[Before and After (Star Trek: Voyager)|Before and After]]", which writer Kenneth Biller claimed was based on a [[Martin Amis]] novel [[Time's Arrow (novel)|''Time's Arrow'']], also features a character experiencing the events in reverse along with the audience. The [[Sealab 2021|''Sealab 2021'']] episode "Shrabster" is also in reverse order. For a few seasons, the revived [[Doctor Who|''Doctor Who'']] had an extensive storyline focusing on a relationship between the Doctor and his companions' daughter (River Song) from the future based on "opposite timelines" (i.e., as the Doctor was travelling through time on one path, River was travelling on an opposite path) causing them to interact in opposite chronological order. In 2017, the British tv mini-series ''Rellik'' (Killer backwards) tells a story about a serial killer in backwards order. In 2018, the episode "[[Once Removed]]", from the series [[Inside No. 9|''Inside No. 9'']] uses reverse chronology to tell a dark story about a family who is moving house, and the murder that subsequently begins. Also from 2018, the second installment of the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] anthology series ''[[American Crime Story]]'' focuses on [[The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story|the assassination of designer Gianni Versace]], employing reverse chronology through the course of several episodes to explore the background of Versace's killer Andrew Cunanan.

=== Comics ===
The story "The Time Eater" from issue 40 of the comic "[[Vampirella]]", scripted by Jack Butterworth and published in 1975, included the concept of human lives running backwards. People were shown to be exhumed, reunited with families, separated from their spouses in order to attend school, and finally returned to the womb. Dialogue was reversed also. [[Alan Moore]]'s 1983 short story "The Reversible Man" from issue 308 of the comic "[[2000 AD (comics)|2000AD]]" told an ordinary man's life backwards, using the same concept as Butterworth but recasting it as a first-person narrative. [[Brian K. Vaughan]] wrote an issue of the ongoing [[Midnighter]] series told in reverse chronology.  The issue explored the fact that the character Midnighter has the ability to calculate millions of possible scenarios for any given situation.  The issue does not have the scenes in reverse order, but rather the individual pages run backwards.

Issue 43 of Bongo's "[[Simpsons Comics]]" is told in reverse order: the story opens with a depiction of a crane lifting a crashed car out of a lake; each subsequent scene (which lasts for one page) carries a caption informing the reader that it took place, for instance, "20 minutes earlier". The penultimate page jumps back thirty years and shows [[Homer Simpson]] as a child

=== Anime ===
The 2007 anime television series ''[[Touka Gettan]]'' employed entirely this narrative method. All 26 episodes were aired in chronologically reverse order, with the first episode being the ending of the story while the last episode being the beginning.

=== Music ===
The lyrics to "[[All Along the Watchtower#Background|All Along the Watchtower]]", written by [[Bob Dylan]], are, he says, "in a rather reverse order"; indeed, the final verse begins with the words "All along the watchtower", and if reversed, the [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]s would tell the story in the correct order.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The lyrics to "Apparition. Apparitions." by [[Trophy Scars]] describe the events leading up to a woman's suicide in reverse order, beginning with her death and ending with her initial romance with her boyfriend.

The song "One Thing Leads to Another" by the [[Pet Shop Boys]] (on a limited release of their 1993 album ''[[Very (Pet Shop Boys album)|Very]]'') describes the events leading up to a man's death in reverse order.

Multiple music videos, including [[Coldplay]]'s "[[The Scientist (song)|The Scientist]]" use reverse chronology in which a scene plays backwards while someone sings normally. This is done by filming the video chronologically but getting the actor to sing the lyrics backwards. The music video for Enigma's "Return to Innocence" uses reverse chronology showing a man's life, beginning with his death as an old man and ending with his baptism as an infant. The music video for [[Linkin Park]]'s "Bleed It Out" also uses the same method, whereas the band performs normally, but everything else is reversed. In 2016, Malaysian Singer-Songwriter Yuna uses reverse chronology in her music video "Lanes".

The events of the song "Reverse" by [[SomeKindaWonderful]], as said in the title itself, are told in reverse chronology.

The lyrics in "Rewind" by NaS also tell a story in reverse chronology, with some of the dialogue even being in reverse order.

"Good Mistake" Album by [[Bahram Nouraei]] is the first Iranian concept album ever made inspired by reverse chronology as the storytelling method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahramnouraei.com/about#/|title=Bahram Nouraei&amp;nbsp;— Official Website|website=bahramnouraei.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been several discussions as to how the picturisation of Neela Vaanam "Manmadan Ambu" (sung by Kamal Haasan himself) has been slightly inspired from official video of Coldplay's The Scientist. The whole song has been depicted in such a way so as to highlight the events that led to the death of Mannar's (Kamal's character) French wife Juliet, in reverse.

=== Video game ===
The [[Dead Island announcement trailer|announcement trailer]] of 2011 video game, ''[[Dead Island]]'', also present in reverse chronological order with flash of chronological action edited into the whole video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZqrG1bdGtg|title=Dead Island: Official Announcement Trailer|website=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Société Libre des Beaux-Arts''' ("Free Society of Fine Arts") was an organization formed in 1868 by Belgian artists to react against [[Academic art|academicism]] and to advance [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] painting and artistic freedom. Based in [[Brussels]], the society was active until 1876, by which time the aesthetic values it espoused had infiltrated the official Salon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arto.be/CONTENT/FR/01_HISTORIEK/02_HISTORIEK.cfm?VER=85 Arto: Aperçus historiques] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217222929/http://www.arto.be/CONTENT/FR/01_HISTORIEK/02_HISTORIEK.cfm?VER=85 |date=2009-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It played a formative role in establishing [[avant-gardism]] in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Kaplan, entry on "Société Libre des Beaux-Arts," in ''The Grove Dictionary of Art. From Renaissance to Impressionism: Styles and Movements in Western Art, 1400–1900'' (St. Martin's Press, 2000), p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first exhibition of the Free Society was held in 1868&lt;ref&gt;Arto: Aperçus historiques.&lt;/ref&gt; to provide an alternative art space beyond the Salon. Three exhibitions were held in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;''Grove'', p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; The society's [[manifesto]] was written by {{Interlanguage link multi|Camille van Camp|nl}} and published 31 January 1869. It promoted the "free and individual interpretation of nature" characteristic of Realist art, along with avant-garde concepts such as "struggle, change, freedom, progress, originality and tolerance."&lt;ref&gt;''Grove'', p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society published the periodicals ''L'Art Libre'', a bi-monthly review (1871–72), and ''L'Art Universel'' (1873–76). In the first issue of ''L'Art Libre'', they collectively asserted:

{{cquote|Artistic independence must be spawned by force. It is our desire that art be free. The art of our time must return to man and nature.&lt;ref&gt;''Avec force l'indépendance artistique doit éclore. Nous voulons que l'art soit libre. L'art de notre époque doit retourner à l'homme et la nature.''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The goals of the Free Society were influenced by aesthetic ideals set forth by [[Gustave Courbet]] and the [[Barbizon school|Barbizon artists]] and by the poet [[Charles Baudelaire]]. "Modernity" and "sincerity" were keywords.&lt;ref&gt;Arto: Aperçus historiques.&lt;/ref&gt; Official cultural critics were at first openly hostile. Two early champions, however, were the critics [[Camille Lemonnier]], a member, who urged that they should "be of their own time," and Théo Hannon (1851-1916), who saw them as rebels against artificiality.&lt;ref&gt;''Grove'', p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

A group portrait by society member Edmond Lambrichs shows the 16 artists of the original organizing committee.&lt;ref&gt;''Grove'', p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; The society attracted in particular landscape painters working at the [[Atelier (art)|Atelier]] Saint-Luc of Brussels, also known as the Académie de Saint-Luc (''ca.'' 1846–1864).&lt;ref&gt;Arto: Aperçus historiques.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Dubois (painter)|Louis Dubois]], [[Félicien Rops]], [[Constantin Meunier]] and [[Louis Artan de Saint-Martin]] are considered leading members.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Robert-Jones, ''The history of Painting in Belgium'' (Renaissance du Livre, 1995), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the society's members had also belonged to the Artistic and Literary Circle of Brussels and the Royal Belgian Society of Watercolorists.&lt;ref&gt;''Cercle artistique et littéraire de Bruxelles'' and ''Société royale belge des Aquarellistes.''&lt;/ref&gt; After the society dissolved, several members joined groups such as ''La Chrysalide'' and ''[[Les XX]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Arto: Aperçus historiques.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Still Life with Candlestick''''' (French: '''''Nature morte aux chandeliers''''', '''''Nature morte, chandeliers''''', '''''Nature morte au chandelier''''', '''''Le chandelier''''') is an oil painting created in 1922 by the French artist [[Fernand Léger]].

This painting was stolen to order on 20 May 2010 from the [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]]. The museum reported the overnight theft of five paintings from its collection, valued at {{Nowrap|€100 million}} (&amp;nbsp;{{Nowrap|$123 million USD}}), though this may be conservative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/articles/gallery-lost-art-theft-of-five-paintings Jennifer Mundy, ''Lost Art: Theft of Five Paintings'', Tate], 22 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sky"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hewage |first=Tim |title=Thief Steals Paintings In Paris Art Heist |url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Thief-Steals-Paintings-In-Paris-Art-Heist-Valued-at-Five-Million-Euros-From-Modern-Art-Museum/Article/201005315635454?lpos=World_News_First_World_News_Article_Teaser_Region_0&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15635454_Thief_Steals_Paintings_In_Paris_Art_Heist_Valued_at_Five_Million_Euros_From_Modern_Art_Museum |accessdate=20 May 2010 |newspaper=Sky News |date=20 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826021142/http://news.sky.com:80/skynews/Home/World-News/Thief-Steals-Paintings-In-Paris-Art-Heist-Valued-at-Five-Million-Euros-From-Modern-Art-Museum/Article/201005315635454?lpos=World_News_First_World_News_Article_Teaser_Region_0&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15635454_Thief_Steals_Paintings_In_Paris_Art_Heist_Valued_at_Five_Million_Euros_From_Modern_Art_Museum |archivedate=26 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Sam|title=Picasso and Matisse masterpieces stolen from Paris museum|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/may/20/picasso-matisse-stolen-paris-museum|accessdate=20 May 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thief and his sponsor were found one year after the heist, and the latter declared that he was seized by panic after a police raid and a phone call by the police. For fear that investigators were closing in, accomplices apparently destroyed the paintings.&lt;ref name="Fincham" /&gt; "I threw them into the trash," cried Yonathan Birn, one of three people on trial in the case, "I made the worst mistake of my existence." However, neither the judge or other defendants believe Birn is telling the truth. Authorities believe all of the paintings were removed from France. Birn's co-defendants testified he was "too smart" to destroy €100 million worth of artwork.&lt;ref name="theguardian" /&gt;

'''The Good Fruit of the Earth''' is a painting created by the [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] painter [[Loukia Nicolaidou]] between the years 1933 - 1936.

== Description ==
The painting, oil on canvas, has dimensions of 188&amp;nbsp;cm. X 140&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyprusdigitallibrary.org.cy/items/show/614|title=Nicolaidou, Loukia (1909-1994), “The Good Fruit of the Earth - Αγαθοί Καρποί της Γης”|last=|first=|date=|website=cyprusdigitallibrary.org.cy|publisher=Ψηφιακή Πλατφόρμα Κυπριακής Βιβλιοθήκης|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is exhibited at the State Gallery of Contemporary Cypriot Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyprusdigitallibrary.org.cy/items/show/614|title=Nicolaidou, Loukia (1909-1994), “The Good Fruit of the Earth - Αγαθοί Καρποί της Γης”|last=|first=|date=|website=cyprusdigitallibrary.org.cy|publisher=Ψηφιακή Πλατφόρμα Κυπριακής Βιβλιοθήκης|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The painting was made by Lucia Nicolaidou-Vasiliou, the first woman from Cyprus to study painting abroad,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sigmalive.com/archive/simerini/news/social/403696|title=Οχτώ Κύπριες άνοιξαν το δρόμο στις υπόλοιπες|last=Σωφρονίου|first=Ελευθερία|date=23 July 2011|website=sigmalive.com|publisher=Sigma Live|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in France. 
In this canvas she demonstrates the obvious influence of [[Paul Gauguin]] as shown in the areas of the forms, the theme and the symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyprusdigitallibrary.org.cy/items/show/614|title=Nicolaidou, Loukia (1909-1994), “The Good Fruit of the Earth - Αγαθοί Καρποί της Γης”|last=|first=|date=|website=cyprusdigitallibrary.org.cy|publisher=Ψηφιακή Πλατφόρμα Κυπριακής Βιβλιοθήκης}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The painting stands out for its large color surfaces and for the female figures mother and daughter, symbolizing the quest for innocence,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyprusdigitallibrary.org.cy/items/show/614|title=Nicolaidou, Loukia (1909-1994), “The Good Fruit of the Earth - Αγαθοί Καρποί της Γης”|last=|first=|date=|website=cyprusdigitallibrary.org.cy|publisher=Ψηφιακή Πλατφόρμα Κυπριακής Βιβλιοθήκης|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while exuding a sense of sensuality absent from the corresponding women depicted in the works of other Cypriot artists of that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Η ανθρώπινη μορφή στη νεότερη Κυπριακή τέχνη: οι πρώτες γενιές|last=Δανός|first=Αντώνης|publisher=Ίδρυμα Ευαγόρα Λανίτη &amp; Κάθλην Λανίτη, Υπουργείο Παιδείας και Πολιτισμού.|year=2006|isbn=|location=Κύπρος|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Lacemaker''''' (circa 1656) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Nicolaes Maes]]. It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is part of the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

This painting is typical of many paintings of women in interiors painted by Maes in the 1650s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=jtnQ7PIT8mcC&amp;pg=PA439 Catalog nr. 110]  in ''Dutch Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art'' Volume I, by [[Walter Liedtke]], Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The woman is making [[bobbin lace]] using a [[lace pillow]] that can be seen in other Maes paintings of lacemakers:

File:Nicolaes Maes 009.jpg|''[[The Old Lacemaker]]'', circa 1655
File:Nicolaes Maes, Lacemaker.JPG|''The Lacemaker'', 1655
&lt;/gallery&gt;


The child in a highchair was a popular subject for many Dutch genre painters, and this painting shows how it was used as a safe place to play as well as for eating. The empty bowl of porridge is on the floor along with some other items the boy has let fall. He is wearing a red ''[[valhoed]]'' or falling cap, which seems to indicate that confinement in the chair is necessary if any lacemaking is going to get done.
Some other 17th-century examples of paintings of children with their high chairs:
&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Govert Flinck 010.jpg|''Girl with her High Chair'', 1640, by [[Govert Flinck]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1914, who wrote; "75. A Young Lace-Maker. [[John Smith (art historian)|Sm. Suppl.]] 13. She wears a red dress and white apron, and sits at a window which lights the room. Beside her, her little child, in a yellow frock, plays in a wooden chair. 
To the right is a table with a red cover, on which is an earthenware pot. 
Signed in full in large antique letters ; canvas, 17 1/2 inches by 20 inches 
according to Sm. and [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen|Waagen]], but 33 1/2 inches by 30 1/2 inches according to the Manchester Catalogue. 
Exhibited in Manchester, 1857, No. 1050. 
In the collection of [[Henry Labouchere, 1st Baron Taunton|H. Labouchere]], London, 1842 (Sm.) and 1854 
(Waagen, ii. 421)."&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AHofstede_de_Groot_catalogue_raisonn%C3%A9%2C_Volume_6%2C_1914.djvu&amp;page=514 75. A Young Lace-Maker]" in Hofstede de Groot, 1914 {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916 Labouchere's heir sold it for $25,000 to [[F. Kleinberger]] who in turn sold it on for $27,500 to [[Michael Friedsam]]. Friedsam bequeathed it to the museum in 1931.

'''''The Lorax''''' is a [[children's literature|children's book]] written by [[Dr. Seuss]] and first published in 1971.&lt;ref name=SLJPicture2012/&gt; It chronicles the plight of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] and the Lorax, who speaks for the trees against the Once-ler. As in most Dr. Seuss works, most of the creatures mentioned are original to the book.

The book is commonly recognized as a [[fable]] concerning the danger corporate greed poses to nature, using the literary element of [[anthropomorphism|personification]] to give life to industry as the Once-ler and the environment as the Lorax.

''The Lorax'' was Dr. Seuss's personal favorite of his books. He was able to create a story addressing economic and [[environmental issue|environmental]] issues without it being dull. "''The Lorax''," he once explained, "came out of me being angry. In ''The Lorax'' I was out to attack what I think are evil things and let the chips fall where they might."&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Lebduska. "Rethinking Human Need: Seuss's ''The Lorax''." Children's Literature Association Quarterly 19.4 (1994): 170-176. Project MUSE. Web. October 20, 2014. &lt;http://muse.jhu.edu/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
A boy living in a polluted area visits a strange isolated man called the Once-ler on the Street of the Lifted Lorax. The boy pays the Once-ler fifteen cents, a nail, and the shell of a great-great-great grandfather snail to hear the legend of how the Lorax was lifted and taken away.

The Once-ler tells the boy of his arrival in a beautiful valley containing a forest of Truffula trees and a range of animals. The Once-ler, having long searched for such a tree as the Truffula, chops one down and uses its silk-like foliage to knit a Thneed, an impossibly versatile garment. The Lorax, who "speaks for the trees" as they have no tongues, emerges from the stump of the Truffula and voices his disapproval both of the sacrifice of the tree and of the Thneed itself. However, the first other person to happen by purchases the Thneed for $3.98, so the Once-ler is encouraged and starts a business making and selling Thneeds.

The Once-ler's small shop soon grows into a factory. The Once-ler's relatives all come to work for him and new vehicles and equipment are brought in to log the Truffula forest and ship out Thneeds. The Lorax appears again to report that the small bear-like Bar-ba-loots, who eat Truffula fruits, are short of food and must be sent away to find more. The Lorax later returns to complain that the factory has polluted the air and the water, forcing the Swanee-Swans and Humming-Fish to migrate as well. The Once-ler is unrepentant and defiantly tells the Lorax that he will keep on "biggering" his business, but at that moment one of his machines fells the very last Truffula tree.

Without raw materials, the factory shuts down and the Once-ler's relatives leave. The Lorax says nothing but with one sad backward glance lifts himself into the air "by the seat of his pants" and disappears behind the smoggy clouds. Where he last stood is a small monument engraved with a single word: "UNLESS".  The Once-ler ponders the message for years, in solitude and self-imposed exile.

In the present, his buildings falling apart around him, the Once-ler at last realizes out loud what the Lorax meant: "Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not." He then gives the boy the last Truffula seed and urges him to grow a forest from it, saying that, if the trees can be protected from logging, then the Lorax and all of his friends may come back.

==Reception==
Based on a 2007 online poll, the [[National Education Association]] named ''The Lorax'' one of its "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children".&lt;ref name=NEA2007&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nea.org/grants/13154.htm/ |title= Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children |author= National Education Association |year= 2007|accessdate=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it was ranked number 33 among the "Top 100 Picture Books" in a survey published by ''[[School Library Journal]]'' – the second of five Dr. Seuss books on the list.&lt;ref name=SLJPicture2012&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.schoollibraryjournal.com/afuse8production/2012/07/06/top-100-picture-books-poll-results |title= Top 100 Picture Books Poll Results |author= Bird, Elizabeth |publisher= ''A Fuse No. 8 Production''. Blog. [[School Library Journal]] (blog.schoollibraryjournal.com) |date= July 6, 2012 |accessdate=August 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a retrospective critique written in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2011 upon the 40th anniversary of the book's publication, [[Emma Marris]] described the Lorax character as a "parody of a [[misanthropic]] ecologist". She called the book "gloomy" and expressed skepticism that its message would resonate with small children in the manner intended. Nevertheless, she praised the book as effective in conveying the consequences of ecological destruction in a way that young children will understand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v476/n7359/full/476148a.html In retrospect: The Lorax]. Marris, E. 2011. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. 476: 147–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In 1988, a small school district in California kept the book on a reading list for second graders, though some in the town claimed the book was unfair to the logging industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958654,00.html?iid=chix-sphere "California: Chopping Down Dr. Seuss"]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.

Terri Birkett, a member of a family-owned hardwood flooring factory, authored ''The Truax'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714145354/http://www.myteacherpages.com/webpages/NDow/files/TRUAX1.pdf "Truax"]. Terri Birkett. National Oak Flooring Manufacturers' Association (NOFMA) Environmental Committee. (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt; offering a logging-friendly perspective to an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] tree known as the ''Guardbark''.  This book was published by the National Oak Flooring Manufacturers' Association (NOFMA).  Just as in ''The Lorax'', the book consists of a disagreement between two people.  The logging industry representative states that they have efficiency and re-seeding efforts. The Guardbark, a personification of the [[environmentalist]] movement much as the Once-ler is for big business, refuses to listen and lashes out.  But in the end, he is convinced by the logger's arguments. However, this story was criticized for what were viewed as skewed arguments and clear self-interest, particularly a "casual attitude toward endangered species" that answered the Guardbark's concern for them. In addition, the book's approach as a more blatant argument, rather than one worked into a storyline, was also noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcdf.org/meadows/truax.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020509134328/http://www.pcdf.org/meadows/truax.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 9, 2002|title=The People-Centered Development Forum - Living Economies Forum|publisher=|accessdate=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aadl.org/node/9624|title=What's A Truax?

The line "I hear things are just as bad up in [[Lake Erie]]" was removed more than fourteen years after the story was published, after two research associates from the Ohio Sea Grant Program wrote to Seuss about the clean-up of Lake Erie.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6rnHjVaTKMMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA276&amp;lpg=RA1-PA276&amp;dq=lorax+lake+erie+line+removed&amp;source=web&amp;ots=In0YHjRebf&amp;sig=WkYwbVQXEzCTQP78cekSaexw1kQ&amp;hl=en "Dr. Seuss &amp; Mr. Geisel : a biography"]. Judith &amp; Neil Morgan. Random House. 1995. {{ISBN|978-0-679-41686-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The line remains in the home video releases of the television special and in the audiobook read by [[Rik Mayall]].

==Adaptations==

===1972 television special===
{{Main article|The Lorax (1972 film)}}
The book was adapted as an animated musical television special produced by [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]], directed by [[Hawley Pratt]] and starring the voices of [[Eddie Albert]] and [[Bob Holt (actor)|Bob Holt]]. It was first aired by [[CBS]] on February 14, 1972. A reference to pollution of [[Lake Erie]] was spoken by one of the Humming-Fish as they depart; it remains in DVD releases of the show, although later removed from the book. The special also shows the Once-ler arguing with himself, and asking the Lorax whether shutting down his factory (thus putting hundreds of people out of work) is practical. An abridged version of the special is used in the 1994 TV movie ''[[In Search of Dr. Seuss]]'', with [[Kathy Najimy]]'s reporter character hearing the Once-ler's story.

===2012 feature film===
{{Main article|The Lorax (film)}}
On March 2, 2012, [[Universal Studios]] and [[Illumination Entertainment]] released a [[3D film|3-D]] [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] film based upon the book. The release coincided with the 108th birthday of Seuss, who died at 87 in 1991. The cast includes [[Danny DeVito]] as the Lorax, [[Zac Efron]] as Ted (the boy in the book), and [[Ed Helms]] as the Once-ler. The film includes several new characters: [[Rob Riggle]] as villain Aloysius O'Hare, [[Betty White]] as Ted's Grammy Norma, [[Jenny Slate]] as Ted's neurotic mother Mrs. Wiggins, and [[Taylor Swift]] as Audrey, Ted's romantic interest. The film debuted in the No. 1 spot at the box office, making $70&amp;nbsp;million, though it received mixed reviews. The film eventually grossed a domestic total of $214,030,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{mojo title|lorax|The Lorax}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audio books===
Two audio readings have been released on CD, one narrated by [[Ted Danson]] in the United States (Listening Library, {{ISBN|978-0-8072-1873-0}}) and one narrated by [[Rik Mayall]] in the United Kingdom (HarperCollins, {{ISBN|978-0-00-715705-1}}).

===Musical===
A musical adaptation of ''The Lorax'' was originally included in script for the Broadway musical ''[[Seussical]]'', but was cut before the show opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Kenneth|title=Ahrens &amp; Flaherty Double Bill of Musicals Pairs Lorax and Emperor's New Clothes|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/ahrens-flaherty-double-bill-of-musicals-pairs-lorax-and-emperors-new-clothe-141201|publisher=Playbill|accessdate=December 26, 2014|date=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From December 2, 2015, to January 16, 2016, a musical version of the book ran at the [[Old Vic]] theatre in London. With former [[Noah and the Whale]] frontman, [[Charlie Fink]], who wrote the music for the production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldvictheatre.com/whats-on/2015/dr.-seusss-the-lorax/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702104801/http://www.oldvictheatre.com/whats-on/2015/dr.-seusss-the-lorax/ |archivedate=July 2, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Three Spinners'''" is a German [[fairy tale]] [[Grimm's Fairy Tales|collected]] by the [[Brothers Grimm]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, ''Grimm's Fairy Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/rumpelstiltskin/stories/3spinners.html "The Three Spinners"]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is tale no 14 and [[Aarne–Thompson]] type 501.  It is widespread throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'' p 716 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has obvious parallels to [[Rumpelstiltskin]] and [[Frau Holle]], and obvious differences, so that they are often compared.

[[Giambattista Basile]] includes an Italian literary fairy tale, '''The Seven Little Pork Rinds''', in his 1634 work, the [[Pentamerone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 585, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of ''Grimm's Fairy Tales'' contained a much shorter variant, '''Hateful Flax Spinning''', but it is "The Three Spinners" that became well-known.

==Synopsis==
Once there was a beautiful-but-lazy girl who would not spin. While her mother beats her for it, the Queen, passing by, overhears and asks the reason for the punishment. Ashamed to admit that her daughter is lazy, the woman replies that the girl spins so much that her mother cannot afford to buy enough [[flax]] to keep her occupied.  The Queen, impressed by such industry, offers to take the girl with her.

Once at the castle, the queen takes the girl to a room filled with flax. If she spins it all within three days, she'll be rewarded with marriage to the queen's oldest son.  Two days later, the queen returns and is amazed to find the flax untouched.  The girl pleads that homesickness has kept her from spinning, but she realizes that excuse will not serve her twice.

[[Rule of three (writing)|Three]] women appear in the room that night. One has a grotesquely swollen foot; the second, an overgrown thumb; the third, a pendulous lip.  They offer to spin all the flax for the girl if she will invite them to her wedding, introduce them as her aunts, and seat them at the high table.  She agrees, and they commence and complete the spinning.

In the morning, the queen is satisfied to see the flax all spun.  She arranges for the wedding to her son, the prince, and the girl asks to invite her "aunts".  When they appear, the king asks how they came to have such deformities, and the three explain that they come from their years of spinning.  The king forbids his beautiful daughter-in-law to spin again.

===Variant: Hateful Flax Spinning===
A king orders his queen and daughters to spin all the time.  One day, he gives them a great box of flax to spin, to his daughters' distress.  The queen invites three hideous old maids to come to the castle and spin.  The king sees them and asks the cause of their deformities.  Their answer: from spinning.  The king forbids his wife and daughters to spin again.

==The Seven Little Pork Rinds==
A girl eats seven pieces of bacon, leaving none for her mother. While the mother beats her for her [[gluttony]], a passing merchant asks the reason, and the woman replies that her daughter is ruining her health by working too hard. The merchant decides on the spot to marry this industrious girl.

The now-married merchant goes on a journey, leaving his wife the spinning. Making an effort to spin, she flicks a passersby with water; some passing fairies are so amused by this that they offer to do the spinning for her.  Despite their aid, the merchant's wife claims that the spinning has made her ill, and the merchant decides not to require her to spin any more, as her mother must have been right about her overworking.

===And Seven!===
In this version, as in the one just described, the part of the king is taken by a merchant; similarly, the mother berates her daughter for "seven" – meaning seven bowls of soup that the girl has eaten – but the mother pretends that they are spindles of [[hemp]] that the girl has spun.

The women helpers in this version – who also are deformed from their years of spinning – instruct the girl to invite them to her wedding by calling their names. If she does not do so, they warn her, she will be worse off than she would have been had they not spun for her. She forgets the names and puts off the wedding while she tries to recall them.  The merchant sees the three women cavorting in the forest and hears them call out their names, similar to the scene in [[Rumpelstiltskin]]; he describes this to his bride in hopes of amusing her and getting her to agree to a wedding date.  She is therefore able to invite her helpers and bring about the happy ending as in "The Three Spinners".

A Puerto Rican version exists, with three Holy Souls in [[Purgatory]] replacing the fairies, and a merchant in place of the king. The heroine in this version is an orphan abused by an aunt.

Multiple artists have used the '''Vitralism''' art movement in the last 10 years, see [https://www.flickr.com/groups/vitralism/pool/ Flickr group].

Vitralism is 21st-century [[art movement]] that uses broken color (similar to [[Impressionism]]) and line extension to achieve a "[[stained glass]]" look and effect. Light and dark colors are painted in many layers with round sponges (the kind used for a [[stencil]]) giving the broken color a transparent quality that simulates the light through a stained glass window. 
[http://www.meleflorez.com/attachments/contentmanagers/51/Woodpecker_full.jpg see example painting]. The background is done entirely with sponges. The subject may or may not be painted with sponges; brushes are used to paint the subject to create texture contrast.

Line extensions contribute to integrate the painted subject with its background. Acrylic paints are the preferred medium for its fast-drying quality, which prevents the mixing of colors on the canvas and keeps the colors almost pure and separated.

[https://www.flickr.com/groups/vitralism/pool/ Here are several photos of paintings created using this method]

The name Vitralism comes from the Spanish word [[:es:Vitral|"Vitral"]] which means stained-glass.  The word vitral comes from the [[Latin]] root [[:la:Vitrum|Vitrum]], which means [[glass]].

==Characteristics==
Some of the characteristics of Vitralism painting include: 
* Round-like strokes on the background and possibly on the subject
* Brush-applied strokes on the subject
* Dark extension lines
* Single subject
* Unity of color – each "piece" of the painting contains part of the color of its adjacent neighbor piece, particularly on the background
* Subjects from nature

==Beginnings==
While experimenting with acrylic colors for the first time, artist Mele Flórez Avellán started testing the paints on a masonite board. With a base of semi-gloss house paint, she started to apply color to her subject. To her discontent, the brush-applied strokes didn’t stick on the support the way she expected. It was not an opaque covering but semi-transparent. Since Mele already took the time to design her painting, she decided to look around her work area to see what could be used to make this a successful painting. Being a crafty person throughout her whole life, her work area was filled with all sorts of gadgets. She took a stencil sponge, dipped it in paint and lightly touched the support with the sponge. She liked what she saw. The addition of white, silver and gold paints gave the painting more light. The line extensions were then darkened to create a strong contrast.

==Techniques==
* Color is applied on the support with tapping movements, lightly touching the support, without dragging the sponges.
* Extension lines are painted with the edge of the round sponges in the same fashion.
* Light mixing of colors occur on the support to make the transition between colors.
* Varnish (gloss or semi-gloss) is applied to the painting when it is fully dry.

==Subjects==
Vitralism uses mainly subjects from nature, like birds, leaves and butterflies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5979">[[File:Calendari kiowa.jpg|thumb|340px|[[Kiowa]] winter count by Anko, covers summers and winters for 37 months, 1889-92, ca. 1895. [[National Archives and Records Administration]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/native-americans/pictures/select-list-140.html "Pictures of Indians in the United States."] ''The National Archives''. (retrieved 4 Feb 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Winter counts''' ([[Lakota language|Lakota]]: ''waníyetu wówapi'' or ''waníyetu iyáwapi'') are pictorial calendars or histories in which tribal records and events were recorded by Native Americans in North America.  The [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfeet]], [[Mandan]], [[Kiowa]], [[Lakota people|Lakota]], and other [[Plains Indians|Plains tribes]] used winter counts extensively.  There are approximately one hundred winter counts in existence, but many of these are duplicates.

==Description==
Most winter counts have a single pictograph symbolizing each year, based on the most memorable event of that year. For Lakota people, years ran from first snow fall to first snowfall.&lt;ref name="eih"&gt;Hansen, 42-45&lt;/ref&gt; Kiowa winter counts usually feature two marks per year – one for winter and one marking the summer Sun Dance.&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Thorton, 300&lt;/ref&gt; The glyphs representing significant events would be used as a reference that could be consulted regarding the order of the years.  More extensive oral histories were passed down using the winter counts as guide posts.

Traditionally each band would choose a single keeper of the winter count. Until the 20th century, these keepers were always men. They would consult with tribal elders to reach a consensus for choosing a name for the year. The keeper chose his successor in recording the count, who was often a family member.&lt;ref name="eih"/&gt;

Until the late 19th century, winter counts were recorded on buffalo hides. When buffalo became scarce, keepers resorted to using muslin, linen, or paper.&lt;ref name="eih"/&gt; The annual pictographs began on either the left or right side of the drawing surface and could be run in lines, spirals, or serpentine patterns.

== Corroborating dates ==
[[Garrick Mallery]], a Smithsonian scholar, recognized that one of those events, "The Year the Stars Fell," correlated with the [[Leonids|Leonid]] meteor storm of November 1833. He used  that event to correlate the Lakota winter counts with western calendars and analyze the history of the people.&lt;ref name="eih"/&gt;
