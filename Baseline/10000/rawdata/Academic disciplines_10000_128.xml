The [[Federal government of the United States]] requires [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) that receive federal anti-[[HIV/AIDS]] or anti-[[Human trafficking|trafficking]] funds to adopt an organization-wide policy opposing [[prostitution]] and [[Sex trafficking|sex-trafficking]]. This requirement, known as the '''anti-prostitution pledge''', has been in place since 2003.

The policy has been criticized as counterproductive, as it hampers enlisting those involved in the sex industry in the fight against AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/supreme-court-says-law-cant-dictate-anti-aids-groups-speech/2013/06/20/1cf84846-d9bc-11e2-a9f2-42ee3912ae0e_story.html|title=Supreme Court says law can't dictate anti-AIDS groups' speech|date=20 June 2013|newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the requirement was only applied to foreign-based NGOs, but in 2005 the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] began applying it to U.S.-based organizations as well, resulting in legal challenges on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] grounds. These challenges were ultimately successful before the Supreme Court, with the 2013 decision in the case ''[[Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International, Inc.|Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International]]''. The requirement remains in effect for foreign-based NGOs that receive U.S. funds.

==Legislation and implementation==
[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] announced the five-year $15 billion [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] in January 2003; [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed it in May 2003 under the name "United States Leadership against HIV/AIDS, [[Tuberculosis]], and [[Malaria]] Act (Global AIDS Act)". The act identifies prostitution and sex trafficking as contributing to the spread of HIV and explicitly advances a new U.S. policy goal: the eradication of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ025.108.pdf US Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003 HR 1298]. 22 U.S.C. §§ 7601-7682. 108th Congress. Retrieved 5 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
The act states:
* "No funds ... may be used to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution or sex trafficking."
* "No funds ... may be used to provide assistance to any group or organization that does not have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking."
* nothing in the anti-prostitution clause "shall be construed to preclude" services to prostitutes, including testing, care and prevention services, including condoms.

In December 2003 Congress passed the [[Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act]] which provided for funding of anti-trafficking activities, subject to the following restrictions.
* "No funds ... may be used to promote, support, or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution."
* "No funds ... may be used to implement any program ... through any organization that has not stated in either a grant application, a grant agreement, or both, that it does not promote, support, or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060216135913/http://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/61130.htm Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003], 22 U.S.C. §§ 7101-7110 (2003). Retrieved 5 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-prostitution pledge language in both acts was authored by Representative [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=nation/&gt;

The [[Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004]] amended the AIDS Authorization to exempt the [[Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]], the [[World Health Organization]], the [[International AIDS Vaccine Initiative]] and any [[United Nations]] agency from having to sign the anti-prostitution pledge.&lt;ref name=aa/&gt;

While the language of the legislation does not distinguish between foreign and U.S.-based organizations, the pledge was initially only enforced for the former, as the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] had expressed First Amendment concerns.&lt;ref name=wp&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/17/AR2005051701247.html U.S. Backs Off Stipulation on AIDS Funds], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 18 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://brennan.3cdn.net/46e14203736808de8b_66m6iyhy8.pdf Letter from Justice Department to Judiciary Committee] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808195530/http://brennan.3cdn.net/46e14203736808de8b_66m6iyhy8.pdf |date=8 August 2009 }}, 24 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2004, a letter from Assistant Attorney General [[Daniel Levin (attorney)|Daniel Levin]] reversed this opinion,&lt;ref name=wp/&gt; and the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] issued a directive in June 2005 that expanded the pledge requirement to all NGOs.&lt;ref name=aa&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/business/business_opportunities/cib/pdf/aapd05_04.pdf Implementation of the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003 – Eligibility Limitation on the Use of Funds and Opposition to Prostitution and Sex Trafficking.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910012240/http://www.usaid.gov/business/business_opportunities/cib/pdf/aapd05_04.pdf |date=10 September 2008 }}, (9 June 2005). Retrieved 5 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A document issued by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] in May 2005 sought to extend the pledge requirement to the large group of organizations that receive funding through the multilateral [[Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] (to which the U.S. contributes). This was quickly overturned by US Director of Foreign Assistance [[Randall L. Tobias]].&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;

==Rationale and reactions==
In a February 2002 [[presidential directive|National Security Presidential Directive]], President George W. Bush wrote: "The United States opposes prostitution and any related activities, including pimping, pandering, and/or maintaining brothels as contributing to the phenomenon
of trafficking in persons. These activities are inherently harmful and dehumanizing. The United States Government's position is that these activities should not be regulated as a legitimate form of work for any human being."&lt;ref&gt;NSPD-22, 25 February 2002. Quoted in [http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/crim/part_2.pdf An Administration Priority] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021095527/http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/crim/part_2.pdf |date=21 October 2008 }}, U.S. Dept. of Justice&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005, a group of non-profit organizations including [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]], the [[International Rescue Committee]], [[Save the Children]] and the [[International Center for Research on Women]] protested the anti-prostitution pledge policy in a letter to US Director of Foreign Assistance [[Randall L. Tobias]].&lt;ref name=wp/&gt; This was followed by a May 2005 protest letter to President Bush, signed by hundreds of organizations worldwide, stating that the pledge "makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to establish the trust necessary to provide services to these hard-to-reach groups" and it will "exacerbate stigma and discrimination against already marginalized groups."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genderhealth.org/pubs/20050518LTR.pdf Letter to President Bush], 18 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

This was countered in August 2005 by a letter to the President supporting the policy, signed by over 100 groups, including the [[Christian Medical and Dental Associations|Christian Medical Association]], [[Concerned Women for America]], [[Family Research Council]], [[Focus on the Family]], [[National Association of Evangelicals]], [[Southern Baptist Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission]], [[Sex Industry Survivors]], [[The Medical Institute]], [[The Salvation Army]], [[World Hope International]] and [[World Relief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/28834.php|title=Over 100 Groups Urge Bush to Enforce Anti-Prostitution Policy to Aid Sexually Exploited Women and Children|work=Medical News TODAY|date=8 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the pledge requirement argued that prostitution is inherently harmful and needs to be abolished, rejected [[harm reduction]] approaches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/595392355.html|title=Christian Medical Association Lauds Anti-Prostitution Pledge Ruling|work=Christian News Wire|date=28 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and held that legalized prostitution increases demand for sex trafficking.&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;

In May 2005, the [[Brazil]]ian government turned down $40 million in anti-HIV/AIDS funding from the U.S. government because of the anti-prostitution pledge. Brazil's AIDS commissioner Pedro Chequer was quoted as saying "Sex workers are part of implementing our AIDS policy and deciding how to promote it. They are our partners. How could we ask prostitutes to take a position against themselves?"&lt;ref name=nation&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050530/kaplan|title=Just Say Não|journal=The Nation|date=12 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-prostitution pledge has been criticized as counterproductive, because projects that work with and support prostitutes are often seen as instrumental in fighting the spread of HIV/AIDS. The Brazilian anti-AIDS program, which employs prostitutes to hand out information and free condoms, is considered by the United Nations to be the most successful in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/01/AR2006030102316.html|title=Where Prostitutes Also Fight AIDS|newspaper=Washington Post|date=2 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sonagachi]] Project is a prostitutes' cooperative in [[Calcutta]], [[India]], that supports [[sex workers' rights]] and works to stop the spread of HIV; it has received strong positive evaluations from both [[UNAIDS]] and the [[World Bank]], and has been cited by UNAIDS as a "best-practice" model of working with prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genderhealth.org/pubs/ProstitutionOathImplications.pdf Implications of U.S. Policy Restrictions for Programs Aimed at Commercial Sex Workers and Victims of Trafficking Worldwide], Center for Health and Gender Equity, November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Weitzer]] has described the anti-prostitution pledge as a symptom of what he calls the "[[moral panic|moral crusade]]" against sex trafficking, resulting in a broad attack against all forms of commercial sex acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weitzer |first1=Ronald |year=2007 |title=The Social Construction of Sex Trafficking: Ideology and Institutionalization of a Moral Crusade |url=http://myweb.dal.ca/mgoodyea/Documents/Migration%20studies/The%20social%20construction%20of%20sex%20trafficking%20Weitzer%20Pol%20Soc%202007%20%2035(3)%20%20447-475.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Politics &amp; Society |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=447–475 |doi=10.1177/0032329207304319 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628043556/http://myweb.dal.ca/mgoodyea/Documents/Migration%20studies/The%20social%20construction%20of%20sex%20trafficking%20Weitzer%20Pol%20Soc%202007%20%2035%283%29%20%20447-475.pdf |archivedate=28 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The language of the policy juxtaposes the words "prostitution" and "sex trafficking"; it has been pointed out that it is important to clearly distinguish between these two concepts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2803%2913596-9/fulltext|author=Butcher K.|title=Confusion between prostitution and sex trafficking|journal=[[The Lancet]]|volume=361|pages=329–332|year=2003|pmid=12801757|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13596-9|issue=9373}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that all relevant organizations already strongly oppose sex trafficking.&lt;ref name=pm&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=4|issue=7|pages=e207 EP –|last=Masenior|first=Nicole Franck|author2=Chris Beyrer|title=The US Anti-Prostitution Pledge: First Amendment Challenges and Public Health Priorities|journal=PLoS Medicine|date=1 July 2007|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040207|pmid=17676943|pmc=1925124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Randall L. Tobias]], the U.S. administration's foreign aid chief who was responsible for implementation of the anti-prostitution pledge, resigned in April 2007 over allegations that he had used an [[escort service]]. Some sex worker organizations and commentators called the situation "ironic" and Tobias "hypocritical".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2007/05/02/prostitution_pledge/index.html The Anti-Prostitution Pledge] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219100932/http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2007/05/02/prostitution_pledge/index.html |date=19 December 2008 }}, ''[[Salon.com]]'', 2 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/04/29/ex_aids_chief_in_escort_flap_called_hypocritical/ Ex-AIDS chief in escort flap called hypocritical], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', 29 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012 final report of [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]]'s Global Commission on HIV and the Law denounced the anti-prostitution pledge and included the recommendation
{{quote|text=3.2.8 Repeal punitive conditions in official development assistance—such as the United States government's PEPFAR anti-prostitution pledge and its current anti-trafficking regulations—that inhibit sex workers' access to HIV services or their ability to form organisations in their own interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Global Commission on HIV and the Law|title=Final Report|url=http://www.hivlawcommission.org/resources/report/FinalReport-Risks,Rights&amp;Health-EN.pdf|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Lawsuits===
In response to the 2005 decision to apply the policy also to U.S.-based organizations, two lawsuits were filed, alleging that the policy compels or prohibits speech in violation of the First Amendment, and also prohibits actions that are exclusively privately funded.

In the first case (''DKT v. USAID''), the non-profit [[DKT International]] prevailed in [[United States district court|District Court]] but lost on appeal, at the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit]]. The February 2007 appeals court ruling was based on the assumption that the government would allow speech regarding prostitution as long as it is done through an affiliate that doesn't receive federal funding.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Court of Appeals (2007 February 27) District of Columbia Circuit Decision in [http://brennancenter.org/dynamic/subpages/download_file_47995.pdf DKT v. USAID No. 05-CV-01604] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517062512/http://brennancenter.org/dynamic/subpages/download_file_47995.pdf |date=17 May 2008 }}. Retrieved 5 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The second case (''AOSI v. USAID'') involved the plaintiffs [[Alliance for Open Society International]], its affiliate the [[Open Society Institute]], and [[Pathfinder International]]. In May 2006, a District Court in New York issued a [[preliminary injunction]], preventing the government from requiring these organizations to sign the anti-prostitution pledge. The government appealed this injunction to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court]]. During the oral arguments in the case, the government stated that it would allow legally and physically separate affiliates to engage in the prohibited speech.&lt;ref name=pm/&gt; The government issued guidelines to this effect in July 2007. In November 2007, the Appeals Court rebuffed the government and let the preliminary injunction stand, returning the case to the District Court. [[Global Health Council]] and [[InterAction]] joined the case, and the District Court extended the injunction to all U.S.-based members of these organizations in August 2008. The Appeals Court, in a 2-1 decision in July 2011, affirmed the injunction and held that the anti-prostitution policy requirement "likely violates the First Amendment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/aosi_v_usaid  ''AOSI v. USAID'' resources], [[Brennan Center for Justice]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20110713031758/http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/11e51f0b-8781-4661-b383-d5d3dc77096b/2/doc/08-4917_complete_opn.pdf Alliance for Open Society International v. U.S. Agency for International Development], Appeals Court decision, 6 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, the [[Brennan Center for Justice]] obtained a ruling forcing the Department of Justice's [[Office of Legal Counsel]] to hand over the original February 2004 memorandum which had argued that the pledge, as applied to U.S.-based organizations, was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. must show anti-prostitution pledge memo for HIV groups: court|date=19 September 2012|work=Thomson Reuters News and Insight|url=http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/News/2012/09_-_September/U_S__must_show_anti-prostitution_pledge_memo_for_HIV_groups__court/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 6-2 decision, the Supreme Court [[Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International, Inc.|ruled]] in 2013 that the anti-prostitution pledge violated the First Amendment: the government may not leverage funding to regulate grant recipient's speech outside of the funded program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agency for Int'l Dev. v.

{{distinguish|text=[[dislocation (syntax)|dislocation]]s, an apposition-like structure whose elements are not placed side by side|opposition (disambiguation)}}

'''Apposition''' is a [[grammatical]] construction in which two elements, normally [[noun phrase]]s, are placed side by side, with one element serving to identify the other in a different way; the two elements are said to be ''in apposition''. One of the elements is called the '''appositive''', although its identification requires consideration of how the elements are used in a sentence.

For example, in the two sentences below, the phrases ''Alice Smith'' and ''my sister'' are in apposition, with the appositive identified with italics:
* My sister, ''Alice Smith'', likes jelly beans.
* Alice Smith, ''my sister'', likes jelly beans.

Traditionally, appositions were called by their [[Latin language|Latin]] name ''appositio'', although the English form is now more commonly used. It is derived from Latin: ''ad'' ("near") and ''positio'' ("placement").

Apposition is a figure of speech of the [[scheme (linguistics)|scheme]] type, and often results when the verbs (particularly verbs of being) in supporting clauses are eliminated to produce shorter descriptive phrases. This makes them often function as [[hyperbaton]]s, or figures of disorder, because they can disrupt the flow of a sentence. For example, in the phrase: "My wife, a nurse by training, ...", it is necessary to pause before the parenthetical modification "a nurse by training".

==Restrictive versus non-restrictive==
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Non-restrictive appositive]] --&gt;
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Restrictive appositive]] --&gt;

A '''restrictive appositive''' provides information essential to identifying the phrase in apposition.
It limits or clarifies that phrase in some crucial way, and the meaning of the sentence would change if the appositive were removed.
In English, restrictive appositives are not set off by [[comma (punctuation)|comma]]s.
The sentences below use restrictive appositives. Here and elsewhere in this section, the relevant phrases are marked as the ''appositive phrase''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; or the ''phrase in apposition''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;.
* ''My friend''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt; ''Alice Smith''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; likes jelly beans. &lt;small&gt;– I have many friends, but I am restricting my statement to the one named Alice Smith.&lt;/small&gt;
* He likes ''the television show''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt; ''The Simpsons''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;small&gt;– There are many television shows, and he likes that particular one.&lt;/small&gt;

A '''non-restrictive appositive''' provides information not critical to identifying the phrase in apposition.
It provides non-essential information, and the essential meaning of the sentence would not change if the appositive were removed.
In English, non-restrictive appositives are typically set off by commas.&lt;ref name=WritingPU&gt;
[http://www.princeton.edu/writing/center/resources/commas.pdf "Commas: Some Common Problems"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Princeton Writing Program, [[Princeton University]], 1999, ''princeton.edu/writing/center/resources/''.&lt;/ref&gt;
The sentences below use non-restrictive appositives.
* ''Alice Smith''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;, ''my friend''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;, likes jelly beans. &lt;small&gt;– The fact that Alice is my friend was not necessary to identify her.&lt;/small&gt;
* I visited ''Canada''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a beautiful country''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;small&gt;– The appositive is not needed to identify Canada.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''The first to arrive at the house''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;, ''she''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt; unlocked the front door.

The same phrase can be a restrictive appositive in one context and a non-restrictive appositive in another:
* ''My brother''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt; ''Nathan''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; is here. &lt;small&gt;– Restrictive: I have many brothers, and the one named Nathan is here.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''My brother''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;, ''Nathan''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;, is here. &lt;small&gt;– Non-restrictive: I have only one brother and, as an aside, his name is Nathan.&lt;/small&gt;
If there is any doubt that the appositive is non-restrictive, it is safer to use the restrictive form.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}
In the example above, the restrictive first sentence is still correct even if there is only one brother.

A [[restrictiveness|relative clause]] is not always an appositive.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}
* ''My sister''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;, ''Alice Smith''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;, likes jelly beans. &lt;small&gt;– The appositive is the noun phrase ''Alice Smith''.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''My sister''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a doctor whose name is Alice Smith''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;, likes jelly beans. &lt;small&gt;– The appositive is the noun phrase with dependent relative clause ''a doctor whose name is Alice Smith''.&lt;/small&gt;
* My sister, whose name is Alice Smith, likes jelly beans. &lt;small&gt;– There is no appositive. There is a relative clause: ''whose name is Alice Smith''.&lt;/small&gt;

==Examples==
In the following examples, the appositive phrases are shown in italics:

* I was born in Finland, ''the land of a thousand lakes''. &lt;small&gt;– Appositives are not limited to describing people.&lt;/small&gt;
* Barry Goldwater, ''the junior senator from Arizona'', received the Republican nomination in 1964.
* John and Bob, ''both friends of mine'', are starting a band.
* Alexander the Great, ''the Macedonian conqueror of Persia'', was one of the most successful military commanders of the ancient world.
* Dean Martin, ''a very popular singer'', will be performing at the Sands Hotel.
* You are better than anyone, ''anyone I've ever met''.
* ''A staunch supporter of democracy'', Rob campaigned against the king's authoritarian rule.

A kind of appositive is the [[false title]], a restrictive phrase, as in "''Noted biologist'' Jane Smith has arrived.", where the phrase ''Noted biologist'' is used as an informal title. The use of false titles is [[False title#Controversy|controversial]].

Appositive phrases can also serve as definitions:
* No one – ''not a single person'' – should ever suffer that way.
&lt;!-- Is the following really an appositive? "the best" is a noun phrase, "better than all the rest" is an adjective phrase --&gt;
* You're simply the best, ''better than all the rest''.

==Appositive genitive==
In several languages, the same syntax that is used to express such relations as possession can also be used appositively. Examples include:

* In English:
** "Appositive oblique", a prepositional phrase with ''of'' as in: ''the month of December'', ''the sin of pride'', or ''the city of New York''. This has also been invoked as an explanation for the [[English possessive#Double genitive|double genitive]]: ''a friend of mine''.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 5, §14.3 (pages 447–448), Rodney Huddleston, Geoffrey K. Pullum, ''The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-521-43146-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** The ending ''-'s'' as in "[[In Dublin's Fair City]]". This is uncommon.
* In classical Greek:
** "Genitive of explanation" as in {{lang-gr|italic=yes|ὑὸς μέγα χρῆμα}} (hyòs méga chrêma), "a monster (great affair) of a boar" ([[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories of Herodotus]], 1.36);&lt;ref&gt;§1322 (pages 317–318), [[Herbert Weir Smyth]], revised by Gordon M. Messing, ''Greek Grammar'', Cambridge, Massachusetts : Harvard University Press, 1956 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0007&amp;query=head%3D%23366 Perseus Digital Library]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Japanese:
** Postpositive ''no'' as in: {{lang-ja|italic=yes|ふじの山|Fuji no Yama|[[Mount Fuji#Variations|the Mountain of Fuji]]}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/nounparticles|title=Noun-related Particles {{!}} Learn Japanese|website=www.guidetojapanese.org|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A dictionary of basic Japanese Grammar|publisher=The Japan Times|year=1986|isbn=4-7890-0454-6|location=|pages=312}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Biblical Hebrew:
**[[Hebrew grammar#Noun construct|Construct]], "genitive of association" as in: {{lang-he|גַּן עֵדֶן|Gan 'Ēden}} ''[[Garden of Eden]]''.&lt;ref&gt;§9.5.3h (p. 153), [[Bruce K.

A '''blast wall''' is a barrier designed to protect vulnerable buildings or other structures and the people inside them from the effects of a nearby [[explosion]], whether caused by [[industrial accident]], military action or [[terrorism]].

== Effectiveness ==
Research by [[Cranfield University]] [[Defence College of Management and Technology|Defence Academy]], building on earlier work, has shown that blast walls have the following properties:
* A non-deforming upright wall will significantly reduce the peak blast [[overpressure]] and impulse in an area between 4 and 6 wall heights behind it
* Similar protection occurs at greater distances behind the wall, but to a diminishing extent
* Blast walls perform best if the explosion is relatively close to the front of the wall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civ.uth.gr/cost-c26/documents/6th%20meeting_Timisoara/presentations/WG3/10.Smith%20-%20Blast%20walls.pdf |title=THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BLAST WALLS |last1=Smith |first1=Peter |last2= |first2= |date= |website=www.civ.uth.gr/ |publisher=Department of Civil Engineering, University of Thessaly |accessdate=6 November 2014}} (p. 5)&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Canopied" walls (with a top section overhanging the front face) show some improved blast protection over plane walls
* A 90-degree canopy is more effective than a 45-degree one&lt;ref&gt;Smith p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;
* Walls containing sand or water work well, and cause little damage if they fail
* A wall has to stay intact long enough to "interact" with the blast in order to have any effect&lt;ref&gt;Smith p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
[[File:Flickr - Official U.S. Navy Imagery - SECNAV examines damage to Camp Bastion, Afghanistan..jpg|thumb|right|Damage to [[Bremer wall]] concrete barriers in Afghanistan, 2012]]
Permanent blast walls can be made from pre-cast [[reinforced concrete]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; or steel sheeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/rrpdf/rr146.pdf |title=Analysis and Design of Profiled Blast Walls |last1=Louca |first1=L A |last2=Boh |first2=J W |date=2004 |website=www.hse.gov.uk |publisher=Health and Safety Executive |accessdate=6 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various types of moveable blast wall have been manufactured. These include the [[Bremer wall]] concrete barriers used in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] by [[US Armed Forces]], and the [[HESCO bastion]]s, wire mesh containers filled with sand or soil, which are used by [[British Armed Forces]].

{{Infobox gene}}
'''Calponin 2''' is a [[protein]] that in humans is encoded by the ''CNN2'' [[gene]].

The ''CNN2'' gene is located at 19p13.3 in the human chromosomal genome,&lt;ref name="pmid8889829"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Masuda H, Tanaka K, Takagi M, Ohgami K, Sakamaki T, Shibata N, Takahashi K | title = Molecular cloning and characterization of human non-smooth muscle calponin | journal = Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 120 | issue = 2 | pages = 415–24 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8889829 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a021428}}&lt;/ref&gt; encoding the protein calponin 2. Calponin 2 is one of the three isoforms of calponin and an actin filament-associated regulatory protein with wide tissue distributions. Human calponin 2 is a 33.7-kDa protein consisting of 309 amino acids with an isoelectric point (pI) of 7.23. Accordingly, it is also known as neutral calponin.

== Evolution ==

[[File:CNN2 wikipage.jpg|thumb|369x369px|'''Figure 1:''' Evolutionary lineage of vertebrate calponin 2 deduced from alignment of amino acid sequences.]]
Calponin isoforms are conserved proteins whereas calponin 2 has diverged from [[calponin 1]] and [[Calponin_3,_acidic|calponin 3]] mainly in the C-terminal variable region. Phylogenetic lineage of calponin 2 showed that calponin 2 is conserved among mammalian species but more diverged among amphibian, reptile and fish species (Fig 1).

== Tissue distribution ==

Calponin binds actin filaments through two actin-binding sites (ABS1 and ABS2), tropomyosin via the N-terminal CH domain, and gelsolin via the region of actin-binding sites. Calponin interacts with microtubules through the region including the actin-binding sites and the repeating motifs and with desmin through the region from N-terminal domain to the end of actin-binding sites. The segment of amino acids 144-182 in calponin interacts with myosin.  In the presence of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[calmodulin]] and [[S100 protein|S100]] bind calponin at the region of actin-binding sites and reverse calponin’s inhibition of myosin MgATPase. An N-terminal 22-kDa fragment of calponin interacts with phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol. *The interaction between calponin and [[caldesmon]] is controversial.

== Function ==

=== Cell proliferation ===

Significant amounts of calponin 2 are found in growing smooth muscle tissues such as embryonic stomach and urinary bladder as well as the uterus during early pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Hossain_2003"/&gt; The expression of calponin 2 decreases to lower levels in quiescent adult smooth muscle cells while the expression of calponin 1 is up-regulated.&lt;ref name="Hossain_2003"/&gt; Transfective over-expression of calponin 2 inhibited cell proliferation.&lt;ref name="Hossain_2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hossain_2014"/&gt; A hypothesis is that higher level of calponin 2 is required in fast proliferating cells to maintain the dynamic equilibrium of the actin cytoskeleton.

=== Cell motility ===

Primary fibroblasts and peritoneal macrophages isolated from ''Cnn2'' knockout mice migrate faster than that of wild type control cells.&lt;ref name="Huang_2008"/&gt; Calponin 2 may affect cell migration differently in different cell types and in different biological processes. A study showed that forced expression of calponin 2 in endothelial cells enhanced angiogenic cell migration ''in vivo'' and anti-sense calponin 2 RNA reduced chemotaxis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in culture.&lt;ref name="Tang_2006"/&gt; A hypothesis is that a proper level of calponin 2 may be required to maintain the physiological motility of different cell types in different biological processes. Calponin 2’s regulation of cell motility is based on inhibition of actin activated myosin motor function, as fibroblasts isolated from ''Cnn2'' knockout mice showed increased cell traction force generated by myosin II motors.

=== Cell adhesion ===

A significant level of calponin 2 is found in human and mouse platelets.&lt;ref name="Hines_2014"/&gt; Platelet adhesion is a critical step in blood coagulation and thrombosis. In a microfluidic flow-based thrombosis assay, the time to initiation of rapid platelet/thrombus accumulation was significantly longer in blood samples from ''Cnn2'' knockout versus wild type mice.&lt;ref name="Hines_2014"/&gt; The effect of calponin 2 on facilitating the velocity of cell adhesion was also shown with prostate cancer cells expression high or low levels of calponin 2.&lt;ref name="Tang_2006"/&gt;

=== Immune cells ===

Significant amounts of calponin 2 are found in blood cells of myeloid lineage. Monocytes derived from ''Cnn2'' gene knockout mice proliferated faster than wild type control cells. Calponin 2-null macrophages migrated faster and exhibit enhanced phagocytosis.&lt;ref name="Huang_2008"/&gt; In global as well as myeloid cell-specific ''Cnn2'' knockout mice, the development of inflammatory arthritis induced by anti-glucose-6-phosphate isomerase serum was significantly attenuated as compared with that in wild type mice . Deletion of calponin 2 in macrophages also significantly attenuated the development of atherosclerosis lesions in apolipoprotein E knockout (''ApoE-/-'') mice&lt;ref name="Liu_2015"/&gt;

== Regulation by mechanical tension ==

=== Gene expression ===

The expression of calponin 2 is significantly increased in cells cultured on hard versus soft gel substrates that produce high or low traction force and cytoskeleton tension.&lt;ref name="Hossain_2005"/&gt; The expression of calponin 2 in NIH/3T3 cells was decreased when cytoskeleton tension was reduced after blebbstatin inhibition of myosin II motors.&lt;ref name="Hossain_2006"/&gt; To demonstrate the ''Cnn2'' promoter-specific regulation, transfective expression of calponin 2 using a cytomegalovirus promoter was independent of the stiffness of culture substrate.&lt;ref name="Hossain_2005"/&gt;

A binding site for transcriptional factor HES-1 (hairy and enhancer of split 1) has been identified in the 5’-upstream region of mouse ''Cnn2'' promoter, responsible for the mechanical regulation.&lt;ref name="Jiang_2014"/&gt;  HES-1 is known to function downstream of the Notch-RBP J signaling pathway,&lt;ref name="pmid9570134"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kageyama R, Ishibashi M, Takebayashi K, Tomita K | title = bHLH transcription factors and mammalian neuronal differentiation | journal = The International Journal of Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology | volume = 29 | issue = 12 | pages = 1389–99 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9570134 | doi =  10.1016/s1357-2725(97)89968-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been suggested to mediate cellular mechanoregulations.&lt;ref name="pmid15705961"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morrow D, Sweeney C, Birney YA, Cummins PM, Walls D, Redmond EM, Cahill PA | title = Cyclic strain inhibits Notch receptor signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro | journal = Circulation Research | volume = 96 | issue = 5 | pages = 567–75 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15705961 | doi = 10.1161/01.RES.0000159182.98874.43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16943241"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morrow D, Sweeney C, Birney YA, Guha S, Collins N, Cummins PM, Murphy R, Walls D, Redmond EM, Cahill PA | title = Biomechanical regulation of hedgehog signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro and in vivo | journal = American Journal of Physiology. Cell Physiology | volume = 292 | issue = 1 | pages = C488–96 | year = 2007 | pmid = 16943241 | doi = 10.1152/ajpcell.00337.2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deletion or mutation of the HES-1 site abolished the mechanical regulation and resulted in a substrate stiffness independent high level of transcription. Therefore, the regulatory mechanism is a low tension-induced repression. Corresponding to the down-regulation of ''Cnn2'' gene expression, the level of HES-1 increased in cells cultured on soft gel substrate in comparison with that in cells cultured on hard substrates.&lt;ref name="Jiang_2014"/&gt;

=== Degradation ===

Calponin 2 is also regulated by mechanical tension at the protein level. A rapid and selective degradation of calponin 2 occurs in lung tissues after a short period of deflation.&lt;ref name="Hossain_2006"/&gt; This low cytoskeleton tension-induced degradation of calponin 2 in collapsed lung was completely prevented in post mortem mouse lung simply by air inflation to maintain tension applied to the alveolae.&lt;ref name="Hossain_2006"/&gt; The cytoskeleton tension-dependent stability of calponin 2 was further confirmed in monolayer cells cultured on expanded elastic membrane by its rapid degradation after a reduction of the dimension of the cultural substrate to acutely reduce cytoskeleton tension.&lt;ref name="Hossain_2006"/&gt;

'''Claudio Di Veroli''' (born 1946) is an Italian-Argentinian [[harpsichordist]] who has written several books and papers on baroque performance practice. Born in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, he was raised in an Italian family  and attended Italian primary and secondary school. He studied privately in Buenos Aires under [[:de:Ernesto Epstein|Ernesto Epstein]] (piano and interpretation), [[:de:Erwin Leuchter|Erwin Leuchter]] (harmony) and [[Ljerko Spiller]] (chamber music), obtained a degree in Mathematics from the [[University of Buenos Aires]] and a PhD in Statistics from [[Imperial College]], London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=J.

'''Coagulase''' is a [[protein]] [[enzyme]] produced by several ''[[microorganisms]]'' that enables the  conversion of [[fibrinogen]] to [[fibrin]]. In the [[laboratory]], it is used to distinguish between different types of ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' isolates. Importantly, ''[[Staphylococcus aureus|S. aureus]]'' is generally coagulase-positive, meaning that a positive coagulase test would indicate the presence of ''S. aureus''. A negative coagulase test would instead show the presence of coagulase negative organisms such as ''[[S. epidermidis]]'' or ''[[S. saprophyticus]]''. However it is now known that not all ''S. aureus'' are coagulase-positive.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan KJ, Ray CG (editors) (2004). Sherris Medical Microbiology (4th ed.). McGraw Hill. {{ISBN|0-8385-8529-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PreTest, Surgery, 12th ed., p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also produced by ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|two/000022192|coagulase}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coagulase reacts with [[prothrombin]] in the blood. The resulting complex is called ''staphylothrombin'', which enables the [[enzyme]] [[protease]] to convert fibrinogen, a plasma protein produced by the liver, to fibrin. This results in clotting of the blood. Coagulase is tightly bound to the surface of the bacterium ''S. aureus'' and can coat its surface with fibrin upon contact with blood. The fibrin clot may protect the bacterium from phagocytosis and isolate it from other defenses of the host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tortora|first1=Gerard J.|last2=Funke|first2=Berdell R.|last3=Case|first3=Christine L.|title=Microbiology: An Introduction|date=2013|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=Glenview, IL|isbn= 978-0-321-73360-3|pages=434|edition=11}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2014-11-15--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The fibrin coat can therefore make the bacteria more virulent. Bound coagulase is part of the larger family of [[MSCRAMM]].

== Coagulase test ==

The '''coagulase test''' has traditionally been used to differentiate ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' from coagulase-negative  [[Staphylococcus|staphylococci]]. ''S.aureus'' produces two forms of coagulase (i.e., bound coagulase and free coagulase). Bound coagulase, otherwise known as [[Clumping factor A|"clumping factor"]], can be detected by carrying out a slide coagulase test, and free coagulase can be detected using a tube coagulase test.

=== Slide test ===
A slide coagulase test is run with a negative control to rule out autoagglutination. Two drops of saline are put onto the slide labeled with sample number, Test (T) and control (C). The two saline drops are emulsified with the test organism using a wire loop, straight wire, or wooden stick. A drop of plasma (rabbit plasma anticoagulated with [[EDTA]] is recommended)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=A.Forbes|first=Betty|title=BAILEY&amp; SCOTT'S Diagnostic Microbiology|publisher=Don Ladig|isbn=0-8151-2535-6|pages=430–431|edition=Tenth|author2=Daniel F.Sahm |author3=Alice S.Weissfeld }}&lt;/ref&gt; is placed on the inoculated saline drop corresponding to test, and mixed well, then the slide is rocked gently for about 10 seconds.

* If 'positive', macroscopic clumping would be observed in the plasma within 10 seconds, with no clumping in the saline drop.
* If 'negative', no clumping will be observed.

If the slide coagulase test is negative, a tube test should follow as a confirmation. Clumping in both drops is an indication of autoagglutination, so a tube test should be carried out. Tube test is not performed each institutions but most of the result depends on blood cultures from lab.

=== Tube test ===
[[Image:Coagulase+.JPG|thumb|A fibrin clot formed in a test tube by the '''coagulase reaction''']]
The tube test uses rabbit [[Blood plasma|plasma]] that has been inoculated with a staphylococcal colony (i.e., Gram-positive cocci which are [[catalase]] positive). The tube is then incubated at 37&amp;nbsp;°C for 1.5 hours. If negative, then incubation is continued up to 18 hours. 
 
* If 'positive' (e.g., the suspect colony is ''S. aureus''), the plasma will coagulate,&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|eight/000106603|coagulase test}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a clot (sometimes the clot is so pronounced, the liquid will completely solidify).
* If 'negative', the plasma remains a liquid. The negative result may be ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis|S. epidermidis]]'' but only a more detailed identification test can confirm this, using biochemical tests as in [[analytical profile index]] tests methods. A false negative can be perceived if the sample is not allowed to cool for about 30 minutes at room temperature or 10 minutes in the freezer, given that the serum can melt. If truly negative, the serum will remain liquid after cooling.

* List of coagulase-negative staphylococci of clinical significance: ''S. saprophyticus'', ''S.cohnii'' subsp. ''cohnii'', ''S. cohnii'' subsp. ''urealyticum'', ''S. captitus'' subsp. ''captitus'', ''S. warneri'', ''S.hominis'', ''S.epidermidis'', ''S. caprae'', and ''S.lugdunensis''

One of the causes of [[attenuation]] of [[radio propagation]] is the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] by the [[atmosphere]]. There are many well known facts on the phenomenon and qualitative treatments in [[textbook]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Antennas and radiowave propagation''. R. E. Collin. Mc Graw Hill, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; A document published by the [[International Telecommunication Union]]  (ITU)
&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;''ITU recommendation ITU-R'' P.&amp;nbsp;676–8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
provides some basis for a quantitative assessment of the attenuation.  That document describes a simplified model along with semi-empirical formulas based on [[data fitting]].  It also recommended an [[algorithm]] to compute the attenuation of radiowave propagation in the atmosphere.  [[NASA]] also published a study on a related subject.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;''http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/handle/2014/41145''. NASA progress report&lt;/ref&gt; Free software from [[CNES]] based on ITU-R recommendations is available [https://web.archive.org/web/20110720212252/http://logiciels.cnes.fr/PROPA/fr/logiciel.htm for download] and is available to the public.

==The model and the ITU recommendation==

The document ITU-R P.676-8 of the [[ITU-R]] section considers the atmosphere as being divided into spherical homogeneous layers; each layer has a constant [[refraction index]].  By the use of [[trigonometry]], a couple of formulas and an algorithm were derived.

Through the use of an [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]], the same results can be directly derived:

[[File:Optinv.png]]

An [[incident ray]] at A under the angle Φ hits the layer B at the angle&amp;nbsp;''&amp;theta;''. From basic [[Euclidean geometry]]:

: &lt;math&gt; |CK| = R\sin u = r\sin\theta. &lt;/math&gt;

By [[Snell's law]]:

: &lt;math&gt; n_1 \sin\Phi = n_2\sin u, &lt;/math&gt;

so that

: &lt;math&gt; n_1 R\sin\Phi = n_2 r \sin\theta = INV &lt;/math&gt;

'''Notes:'''

* One proof &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; starts from the [[Fermat's principle]]. As a result, one gets the proof of the Snell’s law along with this invariance. This invariant is valid in a more general situation; the spherical radius is then replaced by the [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|Radius of curvature]] at points along the ray. It is also used in equation (4) of the 2005 NASA's report&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt; in an application of satellite tracking.
* The assumption of the refraction index varying with the latitude is not strictly compatible with the notion of layers. However the variation of the index is very small, this point is usually ignored in practice.

The ITU recommended algorithm consists of launching a ray from a [[Transmitter|radio source]], then at each step, a layer is chosen and a new [[angle of incidence (optics)|incidence angle]] is then computed. The process is iterated until the altitude of the target is reached. At each step, the covered distance ''dL'' is multiplied by a specific attenuation [[coefficient]] ''g'' expressed in&amp;nbsp;dB/km. All the increments ''g''&amp;nbsp;''dL'' are added to provide the total attenuation.

Note that the algorithm does not guaranty that the target is actually reached. For this, a much harder [[boundary value problem]] would have to be solved.

==The eikonal equation==

This equation is discussed in the references.&lt;ref&gt;''Microwave and optical ray geometry''. S. Cornbleet, Wiley, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Light transmission optics''. Detrich Marcuse, Van Nostrand, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Methods in Electromagnetic Wave Propagation''. D. S. Jones, Oxford, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; The equation is highly non-linear. Given that a smooth data fitting curve n(altitude) is  provided by the ITU&lt;ref&gt;''ITU recommandation ITU-R'' pp.&amp;nbsp;835–4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; for the refraction index n, and that the values of n  differs from 1 only by something of the order&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;4&lt;/sup&gt;, a [[numerical solution]] of the [[eikonal equation]] can be considered. Usually the equation is presented under the self-adjoint form, a more tractable equation for the ray head position vector '''r'''&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; is given in generic parametric form:

: &lt;math&gt; \ddot{\mathbf{r}} = n\, \mathrm{grad}\, n &lt;/math&gt;

==Implementations==

Three implementations to compute the attenuations exist:

* Take the ray to be a straight line.
* Use the optical invariant and apply the ITU recommendationITU.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;
* Solve the eikonal equation.

The first two are only of 1st order approximation (see [[Orders of approximation]]). For the [[eikonal equation]], many numerical schemes are available.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Here only a simple second order scheme was chosen. For most standard configurations of source-target, the three methods differ little from each other. It is only in the case of rays grazing the ground that the differences are meaningful. The following was used for testing:

At the latitude of 10°, when a ray starts at 5&amp;nbsp;km altitude with an elevation angle of&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1° to hit a target at the same longitude but at latitude 8.84° and altitude 30&amp;nbsp;km. At 22.5&amp;nbsp;GHz, the results are:
{| class="wikitable"
!dB

|-
|30.27
|Eikonal
|761.11

|-
|29.20
|Optical invariant
|754.24
|30.33
|-
|23.43
|Linear
|Trace Off
|** **
|}
Note that 22.5&amp;nbsp;GHz is not a practical frequency&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; but it is the most suitable for algorithms comparison. In the table, the first column gives the results in dB, the third gives the distance covered and the last gives the final altitude. Distances are in km. From the altitude 30&amp;nbsp;km up, the attenuation is negligible. The paths of the three are plotted:

[[File:The3methods.png]]

The linear path is the highest on the figure, the eikonal is the lowest.

'''Note''': A [[MATLAB]] version for the uplink ([[Telecommunications link]]) is available from the ITU&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

==The boundary value problem==

When a point S communicates with a point T, the orientation of the ray is specified by an elevation angle. In a naïve way, the angle can be given by tracing a straight line from S to T. This specification does not guaranty that the ray will reach T: the variation of refraction index bends the ray trajectory. The elevation angle has to be modified&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt; to take into account the bending effect.

For the Eikonal equation, this correction can be done by solving a [[boundary value problem]]. As the equation is of second order, the problem is well defined. In spite of the lack of a firm theoretical basis for the ITU method, a trial-error by dichotomy (or [[Binary search algorithm|binary search]]) can also be used. The next figure shows the results of numerical simulations.

[[File:Compare.JPG|Compare]]

The curve labeled as bvp is the trajectory found by correcting the elevation angle. The other two are from a fix step and a variable steps (chosen in accordance to the ITU recommendations&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;) solutions without the elevation angle correction. The nominal elevation angle for this case is -0.5 degree. The numerical results obtained at 22.5&amp;nbsp;GHz were:
{| class="wikitable"
!
!Attenuation
!Elevation angle
|-
|ITU steps
|15.40
| -0.50°
|-
|Fix step
|15.12
| -0.50°
|-
|BVP
|11.33
| -0.22°
|}
Note the way the solution bvp bents over the straight line. A consequence of this property is that the ray can reach locations situated below the horizon of S. This is consistent with observations.&lt;ref&gt;''ITU recommandation ITU-R'' pp.&amp;nbsp; 834-6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The trajectory is a [[Concave function]] is a consequence of the fact that the gradient of the refraction index is negative, so the Eikonal equation implies that the second derivative of the trajectory is negative. From the point where the ray is parallel to ground, relative to the chosen coordinates, the ray goes down but relative to ground level, the ray goes up.

Often engineers are interested in finding the limits of a system. In this case, a simple idea is to try some low elevation angle and let the ray reach the desired altitude. This point of view has a problem: if suffice to take the angle for which the ray has a tangent point of lowest altitude. For instance with the case of a source at 5&amp;nbsp;km altitude, of nominal elevation angle -0.5 degree and the target is at 30&amp;nbsp;km altitude; the attenuation found by the boundary value method is 11.33&amp;nbsp;dB. The previous point of view of worst case leads to an elevation angle of -1.87 degree and an attenuation of  170.77&amp;nbsp;dB. With this kind of attenuation, every system would be unusable! It was found also for this case that with the nominal elevation angle, the distance of the tangent point to ground is 5.84&amp;nbsp;km; that of the worst case is 2.69&amp;nbsp;km. The nominal distance from source to target is 6383.84&amp;nbsp;km; for the worst case, it is 990.36&amp;nbsp;km.

There are many numerical methods to solve boundary value problems.&lt;ref name="ReferenceI"&gt;''Initial Value Methods for Boundary Value Problems''. Mayer. Academic Press, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; For the Eikonal equation, due to the good behavior of the refraction index just a simple [[Shooting method]] can be used.

==Conclusions==

Of the three methods, the linear and the ITU methods require some coding since they are not presented as differential equations. These methods do not benefit from the help of standard numerical packages; however, only high school mathematics are required to understand the methods. The more technical eikonal equation can be solved using standard differential equations solvers offered by a few numerical software packages mentioned in the Wikipedia [[List of numerical analysis software]] and it offers a higher precision order.

The attenuation mechanism as described here is only one amongst many others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceJ"&gt;''Field Guide to Atmospheric Optics (SPIE Vol. FG02)''. Larry C. Andrews. SPIE Publications, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The full problem is much more complex.

[[File:Algeria Sahara Desert Photo From Drone 5.jpg|thumb|381x381px|Sand dunes in the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]]]]&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
'''Desert ecology'''  is the study of interactions between both [[Biotic component|biotic]] and [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] components of [[desert]] environments. A desert [[ecosystem]] is defined by interactions between [[organism]] populations, the [[climate]] in which they live, and any other non-living influences on the [[habitat]]. Deserts are arid regions which are generally associated with warm temperatures, however cold deserts also exist. Deserts can be found on every continent, with the largest being located in [[Antarctica]], the [[Arctic]], [[North Africa|Northern Africa]], and the [[Middle East]].

==Climate==
{{main|Desert climate}}
Deserts experience a wide range of temperatures and weather conditions. They can be classified into four types: hot, semiarid, coastal, and cold. '''Hot deserts''' have warm temperatures at all times of the year, and low annual precipitation. The lack of humidity in these deserts results in high temperatures during the daytime and large amounts of heat loss at night. Although the average annual temperature in hot deserts is 20&amp;nbsp;°C to 25&amp;nbsp;°C, extreme weather conditions can lead to temperatures from -18&amp;nbsp;°C to 49&amp;nbsp;°C. Rainfall generally occurs in concentrated bursts, followed by long periods of no precipitation. '''Semiarid deserts''' experience similar conditions to hot deserts, however the maximum and minimum temperatures tend to be less extreme, ranging from 10&amp;nbsp;°C to 38&amp;nbsp;°C. '''Coastal deserts''' are cooler than hot and semiarid deserts, with average summer temperatures between 13&amp;nbsp;°C and 24&amp;nbsp;°C. They also feature higher total rainfall values. '''Cold deserts''' are similar in temperature to coastal deserts, however they receive more annual precipitation, which much of it in the form of snow.&lt;ref name="The Desert Biome"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pullen|first1=Stephanie|title=The Desert Biome|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/glossary/gloss5/biome/deserts.html|website=University of California Museum of Paleontology|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deserts are most notable for their dry climates resulting from [[rain]]-blocking [[mountain]] ranges and remoteness from [[ocean]]ic moisture.  Deserts occupy one-fifth of the Earth's land surface and occur in two belts: between 15° and 35° latitude in both the southern and northern hemispheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/moja/mojadewd.htm|title=World Deserts|work=Mojave National Preserve: Desert Ecology|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2008-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bands are associated with the high solar intensities that all areas in the tropics receive, and at the same time with dry air brought down by the descending arms of [[Hadley cell|Hadley]] and [[Atmospheric circulation|Ferell]] atmospheric circulation cells.

Deserts generally occur because of global wind patterns or rain shadows. Dry winds not only hold little moisture for these areas, but also tend to evaporate any water present. Rain shadows do not occur because of general wind patterns but rather, due to the wind passing over a mountain range. As air rises and cools, its relative humidity increases and some or most moisture rains out, leaving little to no water vapour to form precipitation on the other side of the mountain range.

Many desert ecosystems are limited by available water levels, rather than rates of radiation or temperature. Water flow in these ecosystems can be thought of as similar to energy flow; in fact, it is often useful to look at water and energy flow together when studying desert ecosystems and ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noy-Meir|first=Imanuel|date=1973-11-01|title=Desert Ecosystems: Environment and Producers|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.es.04.110173.000325|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=4|issue=1|pages=25–51|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.04.110173.000325|issn=0066-4162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water availability in deserts may also be hindered by loose sediments. [[Mineral dust|Dust clouds]] commonly form in windy, arid climates. Scientists have previously theorised that desert dust clouds would enhance rainfall, however some studies have shown that precipitation is actually inhibited by this phenomenon by absorbing moisture from the atmosphere. This absorption can result in a positive [[Feedback|feedback loop]], which leads to further desertification.&lt;ref name="Desert Dust"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Daniel|last2=Rudich|first2=Yinon|last3=Lahav|first3=Ronen|title=Desert dust suppressing precipitation: A possible desertification feedback loop|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=22 May  2001|volume=98|issue=11|doi=10.1073/pnas.101122798|pmc=33408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landscape==
Desert landscapes can contain a wide variety of geological features, such as [[Oasis|oases]], [[Outcrop|rock outcrops]], [[dune]]s, and [[mountain]]s.&lt;ref name="Desert Features"&gt;{{cite web|title=Desert Features|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/features/|website=U.S. Geological Survey|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunes are structures formed by wind moving sediments into mounds. Desert dunes are generally classified based on their orientation relative to wind directly. Possibly the most recognisable dune type are transverse dunes, whose crests are transverse to the wind direction. Many dunes are considered to be active, meaning that they travel and change over time due to the influence of the wind. However, some dunes can be anchored in place by vegetation or topography, preventing their movement.&lt;ref name="Arabian Deserts"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edgell|first1=H. Stewart|title=Arabian Deserts|date=2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-3970-6|pages=201–238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some dunes may also be referred to as sticky, which occurs when the individual grains of sand become cemented together. Sticky dunes tend to be more stable and resistant to wind reworking than loose dunes.&lt;ref name="Sticky Dunes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hesse|first1=Paul|title=Sticky dunes in a wet desert: Formation, stabilisation and modification of the Australian desert dunefields|journal=Geomorphology|date=15 November 2011|volume=134|issue=3-4|pages=309–325|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.07.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of geological features in desert environments can reveal a lot about the history of the area. Through observation and identification of rock deposits, geologists are able to interpret the order of events that occurred during desert formation. For example, research conducted on the surface geology of the [[Namib|Namib Desert]] allowed geologists to interpret ancient movements of the [[Kuiseb River]] based on rock ages and features identified in the area.&lt;ref name="Surface Geology"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eckardt|first1=Frank D.|last2=Livingstone|first2=Ian|last3=Seely|first3=Mary|last4=Von Holdt|first4=Johanna|title=The Surface Geology and Geomorphology Around Gobabeb, Namib Desert, Namibia|journal=Geografiska Annaler|date=17 October 2013|volume=95|pages=271–284|doi=10.1111/geoa.12028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organism Adaptation==

=== Animals ===
{{Main|Xerocole}}
Deserts support diverse communities of plant and animals that have evolved resistance to, and methods of circumventing of, the extreme [[temperature]]s and arid conditions. For example, desert grasslands are more humid and slightly cooler than its surrounding ecosystems. Many animals get their energy by eating plants, but desert plants give up the fruit of their production very reluctantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital-desert.com/joshua-tree-national-park/ecosystems.html|title=Desert Ecosystem|website=digital-desert.com|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid intense temperatures, the majority of small desert mammals are nocturnal, and dig burrows in which they live. These burrows help maintain to prevent overheating and resulting loss of water, and to maintain the mammal's optimal temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecology of Desert Systems|last=Whitford|first=Walter G.|publisher=Elsevier Science Ltd|year=2002|isbn=0127472614|location=San Diego, California|pages=128, 132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desert ecology is characterized by dry, [[alkaline]] soils, low net production and opportunistic feeding patterns by [[herbivore]]s and [[carnivore]]s. Other organisms' survival tactics are physiologically based. Such tactics include the completion of life cycles ahead of anticipated drought seasons, and storing water with the help of specialized organs.&lt;ref name="CLOUDSLEY-THOMPSON"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cloudsley-Thompson|first=J.L.|year=1996|title=Current trends in desert ecology|jstor=43423916|journal=Science Progress|volume=79|issue=3|pages=215–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Desert climates are particularly demanding on [[endotherm]]ic organisms. In environments where the external temperature is less than their body temperature, most endotherms are able to balance heat production and heat loss to maintain a comfortable temperature. However, in deserts where air and ground temperatures exceed body temperature, endotherms must be able to dissipate the large amounts of heat being absorbed in these environments. In order to cope with extreme conditions, desert endotherms have adapted through the means of avoidance, relaxation of [[homeostasis]], and specializations. Nocturnal desert rodents, like the [[kangaroo rat]], will spend the daytime in cool burrows deep underground, and emerge at night to seek food. Birds are much more mobile than ground-dwelling endotherms, and can therefore avoid heat-induced dehydration by flying between water sources. To prevent overheating, the body temperatures of many desert mammals have adapted to be much higher than non-desert mammals. [[Camel]]s, for example, can maintain body temperatures that are about equal to typical desert air temperatures. This adaptations allows camels to retain large amounts of water for extended periods of time. Other examples of higher body temperature in desert mammals include the [[Diurnality|diurnal]] [[Antelope squirrel|antelope ground squirrel]], and the [[oryx]]. Certain desert endotherms have evolved very specific and unique characteristics to combat dehydration. Male [[sandgrouse]] have specialized belly feathers that are able to trap and carry water. This allows the sandgrouse to provide a source of hydration for their chicks, who do not yet have the ability to fly to water sources themselves.&lt;ref name="Vertebrate Life"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pough|first1=F. Harvey|last2=Janis|first2=Christine M.|last3=Heiser|first3=John B.|title=Vertebrate Life|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0-321-77336-4|pages=549–556|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plants ===
{{Main|Xerophyte}}
Although deserts have severe climates, some plants still manage to grow.  Plants that can survive in arid deserts are called [[xerophyte]]s, meaning they are able to survive long dry periods. Such plants may close their [[stoma]]ta  the daytime and open them at night, at the time when a plant may load carbon dioxide while, thanks to lower temperatures, losing less water to evaporation.

Adaptations in xerophytes include resistance to heat and water loss, increased water storage capabilities, and reduced surface area of leaves. One of the most common families of desert plants are the [[Cactus|cacti]], which are covered in sharp spines or bristles for defence. The bristles on certain cacti also have the ability to reflect sunlight, such as those of the [[Cephalocereus senilis|old man cactus]]. Certain xerophytes, like [[Nerium|oleander]], feature stomata that are recessed as a form of protection against hot, dry desert winds, which allows the leaves to retain water more effectively. Another unique adaptation can be found in xerophytes like [[Fouquieria splendens|ocotillo]], which are "leafless during most of the year, thereby avoiding excessive water loss".&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reece|first1=Jane B.|last2=Urry|first2=Lisa A.|last3=Cain|first3=Michael L.|last4=Wasserman|first4=Steven A.|title=Campbell Biology Canadian Edition|date=2012|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0-321-77830-7|page=835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exploration and Research==
The harsh climate of most desert regions is a major obstacle in conducting research into these ecosystems. In the environments requiring special adaptations to survive, it is often difficult or even impossible for researchers to spend extended periods of time investigating the ecology of such regions. To overcome the limitations imposed by desert climates, some scientists have used technological advancements in the area of remote sensing and [[robotics]]. One such experiment, conducted in 1997, had a specialised robot named Nomad travel through a portion of the [[Atacama Desert]]. During this expedition, Nomad travelled over 200 kilometres and provided the researchers with many photographs of sites visited along its path.&lt;ref name="Nomad"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wettergreen|first1=David|last2=Bapna|first2=Deepak|last3=Maimone|first3=Mark|last4=Thomas|first4=Geb|title=Developing Nomad for robotic exploration of the Atacama Desert|journal=Robotics and Autonomous Systems|date=28 February 1999|volume=26|issue=2-3|pages=127–148|doi=10.1016/S0921-8890(99)80002-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The role of the embryo ==
[[File:Haeckel's Evolution of Man Wellcome L0032934.jpg|thumb|Evolution occur through alterations in development]]
In modern evolutionary biology, the idea of developmental bias is embedded into a current of thought called ''[[Structuralism (biology)|Structuralism]]'' (also “internalism” or “variational structuralism”) focused on the role of the organism as a ''causal'' force of evolutionary change&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1005108561|title=HOMOLOGY, GENES, AND EVOLUTIONARY INNOVATION.|last=P.|first=WAGNER, GUNTER|date=2014|publisher=PRINCETON UNIVERSITY PRES|year=|isbn=0691180679|location=|pages=|oclc=1005108561}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the Structuralist view, phenotypic evolution is the result of the action of [[natural selection]] on previously ‘filtered’ variation during the course of [[ontogeny]]&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alberch|first=Pere|date=1989|title=The logic of monsters: Evidence for internal constraint in development and evolution|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0016-6995(89)80006-3|journal=Geobios|volume=22|pages=21–57|doi=10.1016/s0016-6995(89)80006-3|issn=0016-6995|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/biased-embryos-and-evolution/50D5C7174074E980B8A2AB4BC1A55819|title=Biased Embryos and Evolution|last=Arthur|first=Wallace|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511606830|location=Cambridge|language=en|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511606830}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It contrasts with the ''Functionalist'' (also “adaptationist”, “pan-selectionist” or “externalist”) view in which phenotypic evolution result only from the interaction between the deterministic action of natural selection and variation caused by mutation&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;.

The rationale behind the role of the organism, or more specifically the embryo, as a causal force in evolution and for the existence of bias is as follows: The traditional, [[Neo-darwinian synthesis|neo-Darwinian]], approach to explain the process behind evolutionary change is natural selection acting upon heritable variation caused by genetic [[Mutation|mutations]]&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1051973071|title=Evolution: Making sense of life|last=Zimmer, Carl., Emlen D. and Perkins, Alison EH|first=|publisher=Greenwood Village, CO: Roberts|year=2013|isbn=9781319202590|location=|pages=|oclc=1051973071}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, natural selection acts on [[Phenotype|phenotypes]] and mutation does not in itself produce phenotypic variation, thus, there is a conceptual gap regarding the connection between a mutation and the potential change in phenotype&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. For a mutation to readily alter a phenotype, and hence be visible to natural selection, it has to modify the ontogenetic trajectory, a process referred to as ''developmental reprogramming''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arthur|first=Wallace|date=2000|title=The concept of developmental reprogramming and the quest for an inclusive theory of evolutionary mechanisms|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1525-142x.2000.00028.x|journal=Evolution and Development|volume=2|issue=1|pages=49–57|doi=10.1046/j.1525-142x.2000.00028.x|issn=1520-541X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Some kinds of reprogramming are more likely to occur than others given the nature of the genotype-phenotype map, which determines the propensity of a system to vary in a particular direction&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagner|first=Günter P.|last2=Altenberg|first2=Lee|date=1996|title=PERSPECTIVE: COMPLEX ADAPTATIONS AND THE EVOLUTION OF EVOLVABILITY|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb02339.x|journal=Evolution|language=en|volume=50|issue=3|pages=967–976|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb02339.x|issn=0014-3820|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, thus, creating a bias. In other words, the underlying architecture of the developmental systems influences the kinds of possible phenotypic outcomes. 

However, developmental bias can evolve through natural selection, and both processes simultaneously influence phenotypic evolution. For example, developmental bias can affect the rate or path to an adaptive peak (high-fitness phenotype)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;, and conversely, strong directional selection can modify the developmental bias to increase the phenotypic variation in the direction of selection&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uller|first=Tobias|last2=Moczek|first2=Armin P.|last3=Watson|first3=Richard A.|last4=Brakefield|first4=Paul M.|last5=Laland|first5=Kevin N.|date=2018|title=Developmental Bias and Evolution: A Regulatory Network Perspective|url=http://www.genetics.org/content/209/4/949|journal=Genetics|language=en|volume=209|issue=4|pages=949–966|doi=10.1534/genetics.118.300995|issn=0016-6731|pmc=6063245|pmid=30049818|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, both currents of thought are complementary and should be combined to better understand the processes underlying evolutionary change&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;.
[[File:DevelopmentalBiasContinuousTrait.jpeg|thumb|340x340px|Developmental bias for continuous characters. If the main axis of variation (red arrows) is orthogonal to the direction of selection (dashed line), trait covariation will constrain adaptive evolution. Conversely, if the main axis of variation is aligned with the direction of selection, trait covariation will facilitate adaptive evolution.]]

=== Types of bias ===
'''Developmental constraint'''

Developmental constraints refer to the limitations on phenotypic variability (or absence of variation) caused by the inherent structure and dynamics of the developmental system&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Constraints are a bias '''''against''''' a certain ontogenetic trajectory, and consequently are thought to limit adaptive evolution&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;.

'''Developmental drive'''

Developmental drive refers to the inherent natural tendencies of organisms and their ontogenetic trajectories to change in a particular direction (i.e. a bias '''''towards''''' a certain ontogenetic trajectory)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. This type of bias is thought to facilitate adaptive evolution by aligning phenotypic variability with the direction of selection&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;.

== Distribution of phenotypic variation ==

=== Morphospace ===
[[File:Morphospace2.jpeg|alt=|thumb|350x350px|Multidimensional representation of species in the morphospace. Each axis corresponds to a trait, and dots correspond to organisms with particular trait values combinations. In this case, the axes represent the form of the fish species.]]
The morphospace is a quantitative representation of phenotypes in a multidimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a trait. The phenotype of each organism or species is then represented as a point in that space that summarizes the combination of values or states at each particular trait&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chartier|first=Marion|last2=Jabbour|first2=Florian|last3=Gerber|first3=Sylvain|last4=Mitteroecker|first4=Philipp|last5=Sauquet|first5=Hervé|last6=von Balthazar|first6=Maria|last7=Staedler|first7=Yannick|last8=Crane|first8=Peter R.|last9=Schönenberger|first9=Jürg|date=2014|title=The floral morphospace - a modern comparative approach to study angiosperm evolution|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.12969|journal=New Phytologist|volume=204|issue=4|pages=841–853|doi=10.1111/nph.12969|issn=0028-646X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Nonrandom (anisotropic) distribution of phenotypic variation ===
Describing and understanding the drivers of the distribution of phenotypic variation in nature is one of the main goals in [[evolutionary biology]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. One way to study the distribution of phenotypic variation is through depicting the volume of the morphospace occupied by a set of organisms or species. Theoretically, there can exist a natural process that generates an almost-evenly (quasi stochastic) distributed pattern of phenotypes in the morphospace, regarding that new species necessary tend to occupy a point in the morphospace that is close to those of its phylogenetic relatives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199691883.001.0001|title=The Origin of Higher Taxa: Palaeobiological, developmental and ecological perspectives|last=Kemp|first=T.S.|date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780199691883|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, it is now widely acknowledged that organisms are not evenly distributed along the morphospace, i.e. isotropic variation, but instead are nonrandomly distributed, i.e. anisotropic variation&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jablonski|first=D.|date=2017|title=Approaches to Macroevolution: 1.

[[File:Friedrich-Johann-Justin-Bertuch Mythical-Creature-Dragon 1806-détouré.png|thumb|Ontogenetically impossible creature]]
Thus, some phenotypes are inaccessible (or impossible) due to the underlying architecture of the developmental trajectory, while others are accessible (or possible)&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=M.E.|date=2012|title=The developmental renaissance in adaptationism|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534712000031|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=27|issue=5|pages=278–287|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2011.12.005|issn=0169-5347|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, of the possible phenotypes, some are ‘easier’ or more probable to occur than others&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;. For example, a phenotype such as the classical figure of a dragon (i.e. a giant reptile-like creature with two pairs of limbs and an anterior pair of wings) may be ''impossible'' because in vertebrates the fore-limbs and the anterior pair of wings are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] characters (e.g. birds and bats), and, thus, are mutually exclusive. On the other hand, if two phenotypes are possible (and equally fit), but one form of reprogramming requires only one mutation while the other requires two or more, the former will be more likely to occur (assuming that genetic mutations occur randomly)&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;.

An important distinction between structuralism and functionalism regards primarily with the interpretation of the causes of the empty regions in the morphospace (that is, the inexistent phenotypes): Under the functionalist view, empty spaces correspond to phenotypes that are both ontogenetically possible and equally probable but are eliminated by natural selection due to their low [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;. In contrast, under the structuralist view, empty spaces correspond to ontogenetically impossible or improbable phenotypes&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;, thus, implying a bias in the types of phenotypes that can be produced assuming equal amounts of variation (genetic mutations) in both models&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;.

=== Classical examples of anisotropic variation ===
[[File:Theba geminata variability.jpg|thumb|287x287px|Shell variation in nature]]
In a classical natural example of bias it was shown that only a small proportion of all possible snail shell shapes was realized in nature and actual species were confined to discrete regions of the shell-morphospace rather than being continuously distributed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raup|first=D.M.|date=1966|title=Geometric Analysis of Shell Coiling: General Problems|url=|journal=J Paleontol.|volume=|pages=1178-1190|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In another natural example, it was shown that [[Geophilomorpha|soil-dwelling centipedes]] have an enormous variation in the number of pairs of legs, the lowest being 27 and the highest 191 pairs; however, there are no species with an even number of leg pairs, which suggests that either these phenotypes are somehow restricted during development or that there is a developmental drive into odd numbers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arthur|first=W|date=2002|title=The interaction between developmental bias and natural selection: from centipede segments to a general hypothesis|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/6800139|journal=Heredity|language=En|volume=89|issue=4|pages=239–246|doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800139|issn=0018-067X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Conversely, developmental abnormalities (or [[Teratology|teratologies]]) have also been used as a classic example to understand the logic behind the mechanisms that produce variation&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1058406207|title=Freaks of Nature What Anomalies Tell Us About Development and Evolution.|last=Blumberg,|first=M.S.|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|year=|isbn=9780199750641|location=|pages=|oclc=1058406207}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, in a wide range of animals, from fish to humans, two-headed organisms are much more common than three-headed organisms; similarly, Siamese twins theoretically could ‘fuse’ through any region in the body but the fusion occurs more frequently in the abdominal region&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;. This trend was referred to as ''transpecific parallelism'', suggesting the existence of profound historical rules governing the expression of abnormal forms in distantly related species&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;.

== Biased phenotypes I: Continuous variation ==

=== Developmental integration and the P-matrix ===
[[File:Gmatrix.jpeg|thumb|305x305px|Representation of the relationship between two traits. Left: No trait covariation. Each trait changes independently of the other. Right: Trait covariation causes a positive correlation between traits where increase in one trait is correlated with an increase in the other trait (covariation can also produce negative correlation). The red line within the ellipse represents the main eigenvector of the variance-covariance matrix.]]
Integration or covariation among traits during development has been suggested to constrain phenotypic evolution to certain regions of the morphospace and limit adaptive evolution&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goswami|first=A.|last2=Smaers|first2=J.

These [[Allometry|allometric]] changes are widespread in nature and can account for a wide variety of realized morphologies and subsequent ecological and physiological changes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gould|first=S.J.|date=1966|title=Allometry and Size in Ontogeny and Phylogeny.|url=|journal=Biol Rev.|volume=41|pages=587–640|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Emlen|first=Douglas J.|date=2001-02-23|title=Costs and the Diversification of Exaggerated Animal Structures|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/291/5508/1534|journal=Science|language=en|volume=291|issue=5508|pages=1534–1536|doi=10.1126/science.1056607|issn=0036-8075|pmid=11222856}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Under this approach, phenotype is seen as an integrated system where each trait develops and evolves in concert with the other traits, and thus, a change in one trait affects the interacting parts in a correlated manner&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pigliucci|first=M|date=2003|title=Phenotypic integration: studying the ecology and evolution of complex phenotypes|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1461-0248.2003.00428.x|journal=Ecology Letters|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=265–272|doi=10.1046/j.1461-0248.2003.00428.x|issn=1461-023X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The correlation between traits is a consequence of the architecture of the genotype-phenotype map, particularly the [[Pleiotropy|pleiotropic]] effects of underlying genes&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;. This correlated change between traits can be measured and analyzed through a phenotypic variance-covariance matrix (P-matrix) which summarizes the dimensions of phenotypic variability and the main axis of variation&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;.

=== Quantitative genetics and the G-matrix ===
[[Quantitative genetics]] is a statistical framework mainly concerned with modeling the evolution of continuous characters &lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;. Under this framework, correlation between traits could be the result of two processes: 1) natural selection acting simultaneously on several traits ensuring that they are inherited together (i.e. [[linkage disequilibrium]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lande|first=Russell|last2=Arnold|first2=Stevan J.|date=1983|title=The Measurement of Selection on Correlated Characters|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2408842|journal=Evolution|volume=37|issue=6|pages=1210–1226|doi=10.2307/2408842}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or 2) natural selection acting on one trait causing correlated change in other traits due to pleiotropic effects of genes&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;. For a set of traits, the equation that describe the variance among traits is the multivariate breeder’s equation Δz = β x G, where Δz is the vector of differences in trait means, β is a vector of selection coefficients, and G is a matrix of the [[additive genetic variance]] and covariance between traits&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnold|first=S.J.|date=1992|title=Constraints on phenotypic evolution|url=|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=140|pages=S85-S107|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steppan, Scott J., Patrick C. Phillips, and David Houle.|first=|date=2002|title=Comparative quantitative genetics: evolution of the G matrix|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534702025053|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|language=en|volume=17|issue=7|pages=320–327|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02505-3|issn=0169-5347|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, a population’s immediate ability to respond to selection is determined by the G-matrix, in which the variance is a function of standing genetic variation, and the covariance arises from pleiotropy and linkage disequilibrium&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Adam G.|last2=Arnold|first2=Stevan J.|last3=Bürger|first3=Reinhard|date=2007|title=THE MUTATION MATRIX AND THE EVOLUTION OF EVOLVABILITY|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00071.x|journal=Evolution|language=en|volume=61|issue=4|pages=727–745|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00071.x|issn=0014-3820|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Although the G-matrix is one of the most relevant parameters to study evolvability&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;, the mutational matrix (M-matrix), also known as the distribution of mutational effects, has been shown to be of equivalent importance&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;. The M-matrix describes the potential effects of new mutations on the existing genetic variances and covariances, and these effects will depend on the epistatic and pleiotropic interactions of the underlying genes&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheverud|first=James M.|date=1984|title=Quantitative genetics and developmental constraints on evolution by selection|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022519384800508|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=110|issue=2|pages=155–171|doi=10.1016/s0022-5193(84)80050-8|issn=0022-5193|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In other words, the M-matrix determines the G-matrix, and thus, the response to selection of a population&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;. Similarly to the P-matrix, the G-matrix describes the main axis of variation.
=== Paths of least resistance ===
[[File:Morphospace&amp;FitnessLandscape.jpeg|thumb|325x325px|Morphospace and fitness landscape with a single fitness optimum. For a population undergoing directional selection, the main axis of variation (largest axis of the white ellipse) will bias the main direction of the trajectory toward the fitness optimum (arrow). The rate and of the trajectory through the morphospace will be inversely proportional to the angle (beta) formed between the direction of selection (dashed line) and the main axis of variation.]]A general consequence of the P-matrices and G-matrices is that evolution will tend to follow the ‘path of least resistance’. In other words, if the main axis of variation is aligned with the direction of selection, covariation (genetic or phenotypic) will facilitate the rate of adaptive evolution; however, if the main axis of variation is orthogonal to the direction of selection, covariation will constrain the rate of adaptive evolution&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;. In general, for a population under the influence of a single fitness optimum, the rate of morphological divergence (from an ancestral to a new phenotype or between pairs of [[species]]) is inversely proportional to the angle formed by the main axis of variation and the direction of selection, causing a curved trajectory through the morphospace&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schluter|first=Dolph|date=1996|title=Adaptive Radiation Along Genetic Lines of Least Resistance|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2410734|journal=Evolution|volume=50|issue=5|pages=1766–1774|doi=10.2307/2410734}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

From the P-matrix for a set of characters, two broadly important measures of the propensity of variation can be extracted: 1) Respondability: ability of a developmental system to change in any direction, and 2) [[Evolvability]]: ability of a developmental system to change in the direction of natural selection&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;. In the latter, the main axis of phenotypic variation is aligned with the direction of selection. Similarly, from the G-matrix, the most important parameter that describes the propensity of variation is the lead [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvector]] of G (g&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;), which describes the direction of greatest [[additive genetic variance]] for a set of continuous traits within populations&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;. For a population undergoing directional selection, g&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; will bias the main direction of the trajectory&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;.

== Biased phenotypes II: Properties of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) ==

=== Hierarchy and o''ptimal pleiotropy'' ===
[[File:Melanism in Panthera Onca.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Different vertebrate species have evolved [[Melanism|melanic]] forms from parallel mutations at the [[Melanocortin 1 receptor|''mc1r'' gene]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoekstra|first=H E|date=2006-07-05|title=Genetics, development and evolution of adaptive pigmentation in vertebrates|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.6800861|journal=Heredity|language=En|volume=97|issue=3|pages=222–234|doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800861|issn=0018-067X}}&lt;/ref&gt;. ]]
[[Gene regulatory network|GRNs]] are modular, multilayered, and semi-hierarchically systems of genes and their products: each [[transcription factor]] provides multiple inputs to other genes, creating a complex array of interactions&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erwin|first=Douglas H.|last2=Davidson|first2=Eric H.|date=2009|title=The evolution of hierarchical gene regulatory networks|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2499|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|language=En|volume=10|issue=2|pages=141–148|doi=10.1038/nrg2499|issn=1471-0056|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and information regarding the timing, place and amount of gene expression generally flows from few high-level control genes through multiple intermediate genes to peripheral gene batteries that ultimately determine the fate of each cell&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;. This type of architecture implies that high-level control genes tend to be more [[Pleiotropy|pleiotropic]] affecting multiple downstream genes, whereas intermediate and peripheral genes tend to have moderate to low pleiotropic effects, respectively&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;.

In general, it is expected that newly arisen mutations with higher dominance and fewer pleiotropic and [[Epistasis|epistatic]] effects are more likely to be targets of evolution&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/762460688|title=Evolution, development, &amp; the predictable genome|last=Stern|first=D.L.|date=2011|publisher=Roberts and Company Publishers|year=|isbn=1936221012|location=Greenwood Village, Colorado|pages=|oclc=762460688}}&lt;/ref&gt;, thus, the hierarchical architecture of developmental pathways may bias the genetic basis of evolutionary change. For instance, genes within GRNs with “optimally pleiotropic” effects, that is, genes that have the most widespread effect on the trait under selection but few effects on other traits, are expected to accumulate a higher proportion of mutations that cause evolutionary change&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kopp|first=A.|date=2009|title=Metamodels and phylogenetic replication: A systematic approach to the evolution of developmental pathways|url=|journal=Evolution|volume=63|pages=2771–2789|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These ''strategically-positioned'' genes have the potential to filter random genetic variation and translate it to nonrandom functionally integrated phenotypes, making adaptive variants effectively accessible to selection&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;, and, thus, many of the mutations contributing to phenotypic evolution may be concentrated in these genes&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stern|first=D.L.|last2=Orgogozo|first2=V.|date=2008|title=THE LOCI OF EVOLUTION: HOW PREDICTABLE IS GENETIC EVOLUTION?|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00450.x|journal=Evolution|language=en|volume=62|issue=9|pages=2155–2177|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00450.x|issn=0014-3820|pmc=2613234|pmid=18616572|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Neutral Networks ===
The genotype-phenotype map perspective establishes that the way in which genotypic variation can be mapped to phenotypic variation is critical for the ability of a system to evolve&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;. The prevalence of [[Neutral mutation|neutral mutations]] in nature implies that biological systems have more [[Genotype|genotypes]] than [[Phenotype|phenotypes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schuster|first=Peter|last2=Fontana|first2=Walter|last3=Stadler|first3=Peter F.|last4=Hofacker|first4=Ivo L.|date=1994|title=From sequences to shapes and back: a case study in RNA secondary structures|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/255/1344/279|journal=Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B|language=en|volume=255|issue=1344|pages=279–284|doi=10.1098/rspb.1994.0040|issn=0962-8452|pmid=7517565|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and a consequence of this ‘many-to-few’ relationship between genotype and phenotype is the existence of ''neutral networks''&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagner|first=Andreas|date=2011|title=Genotype networks shed light on evolutionary constraints|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534711001996|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=26|issue=11|pages=577–584|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2011.07.001|issn=0169-5347|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In development, neutral networks are clusters of GRNs that differ in only one interaction between two nodes (e.g. replacing transcription with suppression) and yet produce the same phenotypic outcome&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;. In this sense, an individual phenotype within a population could be mapped to several equivalent GRNs, that together constitute a neutral network. Conversely, a GRN that differs in one interaction and causes a different phenotype is considered non-neutral&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. Given this architecture, the probability of mutating from one phenotype to another will depend on the number of neutral-neighbors relative to non-neutral neighbors for a particular GRN&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;, and thus, phenotypic change will be influenced by the position of a GRN within the network and will be biased towards changes that require few mutations to reach a neighboring non-neutral GRN&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;.

A '''discovery system''' may be an [[artificial intelligence]] system (in the context of computer science, logic, and mathematics) or a [[bibliographic database|bibliographical search system]] (in the context of library and information science).

== [[Artificial intelligence]] ==
A '''discovery system''' is an [[artificial intelligence]] system that attempts to  discover new scientific concepts or laws.

Notable discovery systems have included

*Autoclass
*[[Automated Mathematician]]
*[[DALTON]]
*[[Eurisko]]
*[[Glauber]]
*Machine for Questions and Answers
*Stahl

== [[Bibliographic database|Bibliographical search system]] ==
A '''discovery system''' is a [[bibliographic database|bibliographic search system]] based on [[Search engine (computing)|search engine]] technology. It is part of the concept of [[Library 2.0]] and is intended to supplement or even replace the existing [[Online public access catalog|OPAC]] [[Library catalog|catalog]]s.

=== Typical features of a discovery system ===
* Large search space: A search can search the data from different data sources (the discovery system has a comprehensive central subject index). For example, you can search a journal article or a textbook directly in the discovery system and you do not have to change from a subject database to the library catalog.
* Intuitive usability, like a search engine. The search is basically only a simple form, an advanced search function is not always provided.
* Ranking of the results according to relevance: The "best" hit is displayed first, not necessarily the newest one. A good ranking is important because many hits are often found due to the large search space.
* Search refinement with drill-down menus (facets): For example, a search can be restricted to all matches available online.
* Correction of input errors via a "Did you mean ...?" function.
* [[Autocomplete]]: After input to the search field, a [[drop-down list]] of suggestions appears.
* Exploratory search: One finds results of interest that were not specifically requested. For example, links to similar hits, entries in [[bibliographic database|subject databases]], or [[Wikipedia]] articles are displayed (integration of other web technologies).

=== Examples of Discovery System Products ===
Commercial products:
* [[Summon]] (Serial Solutions)
* Primo Central ([[Ex Libris Group|ExLibris]])

Open Source products:
* VuFind (Villanova University Library)
* Lukida ([[:de:Gemeinsamer Bibliotheksverbund|GBV Common Library Network]])

{{lowercase|eSTAR}}
The '''eSTAR project''' was a [[multi-agent system]] that aims to implement a true heterogeneous network of [[robotic telescope]]s for automated observing. The project is a joint collaboration between the Astrophysics Group of the [[University of Exeter]] and the Astrophysics Research Institute at [[Liverpool John Moores University]].

In 2006 work began on an autonomous [[software agent]] for observations of [[variable stars]]. This agent implements the optimal sampling technique of Saunders et al. (2006) and the prototype was successfully tested on the RoboNet network of telescopes which includes: the [[Liverpool Telescope]], the [[Faulkes Telescope North]] and the [[Faulkes Telescope South]].

eSTAR is affiliated with the RoboNet Consortium and the global Heterogeneous Telescope Networks Consortium.

As of 2007 eSTAR is "live" supporting two real-time observing projects. Automated follow-up observations of [[gamma-ray burst]]s are performed using the 3.8m [[UKIRT]] telescope situated in [[Hawaii|Hawai'i]], making this telescope the largest in the world{{Clarify|date=July 2010|needs explanation - see talk page}}, with an automated response system for tracking such events.

eSTAR is also involved in the search for [[extra-solar planets]] by placing observations on the [[RoboNet]] system of telescopes on behalf of the [[Probing Lensing Anomalies Network|PLANET]] collaboration. The technique of [[gravitational microlensing]] is used to monitor large numbers of stars in the galactic bulge looking for the tell-tale signature of cool planets orbiting those stars.{{Clarify|date=July 2010|needs explanation - see talk page}}

'''Emerging adulthood''' is a phase of the life span between [[adolescence]] and full-fledged [[adulthood]] which encompasses late adolescence and early adulthood, proposed by [[Jeffrey Arnett]] in a 2000 article in the ''[[American Psychologist]]''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnett | first1 = Jeffrey Jensen | year = 2000 | title = Emerging adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the twenties | url = http://content.apa.org/journals/amp/55/5/469 | journal = [[American Psychologist]] | volume = 55 | issue = 5| pages = 469–480 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.55.5.469 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It primarily describes people living in [[Developed country|developed countries]], but it is also experienced by young people in urban wealthy families in the [[Global south|Global South]].&lt;ref name=Galambos&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galambos|first1=Nancy|last2=Martinez|first2=M.

Arnett suggests emerging adulthood is the distinct period between 18 and 25 years of age where adolescents become more independent and explore various life possibilities. Arnett argues that this developmental period can be isolated from [[adolescence]] and [[young adulthood]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Emerging adulthood is a new demographic, is contentiously changing, and some&lt;ref name="Devin Ludwig"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/devin-ludwig/post_723_b_691244.html| title=  Challenges of the Young Adult Generation| last=  Ludwig| first=  Devin| publisher=''[[Huffington Post]]''| date=  August 23, 2010| accessdate =August 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; believe that twenty-somethings have always struggled with "identity exploration, instability, self-focus, and feeling in-between".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marantz Henig|first=Robin|title=What Is It About 20&amp;#8209;Somethings?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/magazine/22Adulthood-t.html?pagewanted=all|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arnett called this period "roleless role" because emerging adults do a wide variety of activities, but are not constrained by any sort of "role requirements".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The developmental theory is highly controversial within the developmental field, and developmental psychologists argue over the legitimacy of Arnett's theories and methods.

==Distinction from young adulthood and adolescence==

===Terminology===
Coined by psychology professor Jeffrey Arnett, emerging adulthood has been known variously as "transition age youth",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Multisystemic Therapy for Emerging Adults With Serious Mental Illness and Justice Involvement|first1=Ashli J.|last1=Sheidow|first2=Michael R.|last2=McCart|journal=Cognitive and Behavioral Practice|volume=23|issue=3|date=August 2016|pages=356–367|doi=10.1016/j.cbpra.2015.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;{{cite|title=Addressing sexual health behaviour during emerging adulthood: a critical review of the literature|first1=Kamila A|last1=Alexander|first2=Loretta S|last2=Jemmott|first3=Anne M|last3=Teitelman|first4=Patricia|last4=D'Antonio|journal=Journal of Clinical Nursing|volume=24|issue=1-2|date=January 2015|pages=4–18|doi=10.1111/jocn.12640}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref name= Walker/&gt; --&gt; "delayed adulthood",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Insights on Adolescence from a Life Course Perspective|first1=Monica Kirkpatrick|last1=Johnson|first2=Robert|last2=Crosnoe|first3=Glen H.|last3=Elder Jr.|date=March 2011|journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence|volume=21|issue=1, Special issue|pages=273–280|doi=10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00728.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; "extended adolescence", "youthhood",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Religious Zionist Singles and Late-Modern Youth Culture|first=Ari|last=Engelberg|journal=Israel Studies Review|volume=28|issue=2|year=2013|pages=1–17|doi=10.3167/isr.2013.280202}}&lt;/ref&gt; "adultolescence",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Book Reviews|year=2008|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=46|issue=4|pages=989-1041|doi=10.1257/jel.46.4.989}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the [[twixter]] years".&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite|title=Lost in Transition: The Dark Side of Emerging Adulthood|first1=Christian|last1=Smith|first2=Kari|last2=Christoffersen|first3=Hilary|last3=Davidson|first4=Patricia Snell|last4=Herzog|publisher=Oxford Scholarship Online|date=January 2012|page=15|isbn=9780199828029|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199828029.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the various terms, "emerging adulthood" has become popular among sociologists, psychologists, and government agencies as a way to describe this period of life in between adolescence and young adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Precedent as a Policy Map: What Miller v.

Compared to other terms that have been used which give the impression that this stage is just a "last hurrah" of adolescence, "emerging adulthood" recognizes the uniqueness of this period of life.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; Currently, it is appropriate to define adolescence as the period spanning ages 12 to 18. This is because people in this age group in the United States typically live at home with their parents, are undergoing pubertal changes, attend middle schools and high schools and are involved in a "school-based peer culture". All of these characteristics are no longer normative after the age of 18, and it is, therefore, considered inappropriate to call young adults "adolescence" or "late adolescence". Furthermore, in the United States, the age of 18 is the age at which people are able to legally vote and citizens are granted full rights upon turning 21 years of age.&lt;ref name=arnett /&gt;

According to Arnett, the term "young adulthood" suggests that adulthood has already been reached, but most people in the emerging adulthood stage no longer consider themselves adolescents, but do not see themselves entirely as adults either.&lt;ref name=arnett&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnett | first1 = J. J. | year = 2000 | title = Emerging Adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the twenties | journal = [[American Psychologist]] | volume = 55 | issue = 5| page = 477 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.55.5.469}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, milestones such as finishing secondary school, finding a job, and getting married clearly marked the entrance to adulthood, but in modern, post-industrialized nations, as positions requiring a college degree have become more common and the average age of marriage has become older the length of time between leaving adolescence and reaching these milestones has been extended, delaying the age at which many young people fully enter adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=The Transitory Nature of Parent, Sibling and Romantic Partner Relationships in Emerging Adulthood|first1=Avidan|last1=Milevsky|first2=Kristie|last2=Thudium|first3=Jillian|last3=Guldin|publisher=Springer|year=2014|page=1|isbn=9783319066387|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UtIkBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;ots=8iOUHglJSG&amp;dq=%22The%20transition%20from%20adolescence%20to%20adulthood%20is%20a%20significant%20period%20in%20the%20life%20of%20an%20individual.%22&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the years 18–25 are classified as "young adulthood", Arnett believes it is then difficult to find an appropriate term for the thirties. Emerging adults are still in the process of obtaining an education, are unmarried, and are childless. By age thirty, most of these individuals do see themselves as adults, based on the belief that they have more fully formed "individualistic qualities of character" such as self-responsibility, financial independence, and independence in decision-making. Arnett suggests that many of the individualistic characteristics associated with adult status correlate to, but are not dependent upon, the role responsibilities associated with a career, marriage, and/or parenthood.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Exploration of identity===
One of the most important features of emerging adulthood is that this age period allows for exploration in love, work, and worldviews more than any other age period. The process of identity formation emerges in adolescence but mostly takes place in emerging adulthood. Regarding love, although adolescents in the United States usually begin dating between ages 12 and 14, they usually view this dating as recreational. It is not until emerging adulthood that identity formation in love becomes more serious.&lt;ref name=arnett /&gt; Emerging adults are considering their own developing identities as a reference point for a lifetime relationship partner, so they explore romantically and sexually as there is less parental control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Emerging adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the twenties|last = Arnett|first = Jeffrey|date = 2000|journal = American Psychologist|doi = 10.1037/0003-066x.55.5.469|pmid = |access-date =|volume=55|pages=469–480}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in the United States during adolescence dating usually occurs in groups and in situations such as parties and dances, in emerging adulthood, relationships last longer and often include sexual relations as well as cohabitation.&lt;ref&gt;Padgham, J.&amp;nbsp;J., &amp; Blyth, D.&amp;nbsp;A. (1991). "Dating during adolescence". In R.&amp;nbsp;M. Lerner, A.&amp;nbsp;C. Peterson, &amp; J.&amp;nbsp;Brooks-Gunn (Eds.), ''Encyclopedia of adolescence'' (pp. 196-198). New York: Garland.&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as work, the majority of working adolescents in the United States tend to see their jobs as a way to make money for recreational activities rather than preparing them for a future career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bachman | first1 = J. G. | last2 = Schulenberg | first2 = J. | year = 1993 | title = How part-time work intensity relates to drug use, problem behavior, time use, and satisfaction among high school seniors: Are these consequences or just correlates? | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 220–235 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.29.2.220}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, 18- to 25-year-olds in emerging adulthood view their jobs as a way to obtain the knowledge and skills that will prepare them for their future adulthood careers. Because emerging adults have the possibility of having numerous work experiences, they are able to figure out what type of work they are good at as well find what type of work they want to pursue for the rest of their life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Undergoing changes in worldviews is a main division of cognitive development during emerging adulthood.&lt;ref name=perry&gt;Perry, W.&amp;nbsp;G. (1999). "Forms of ethical and intellectual development in the college years": "A scheme" San Francisco: Jossey-Bass. (Original work published 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

People in emerging adulthood that choose to attend college often begin college or university with the worldview they were raised with and learned in childhood and adolescence. However, emerging adults who have attended college or university have been exposed to and have considered different worldviews, and eventually commit to a worldview that is distinct from the worldview with which they were raised by the end of their college or university career.&lt;ref name=perry /&gt;

===Subjective difference===
When Americans between the ages of 18 and 25 are asked whether they believe they have reached adulthood, most do not answer with a "no" or a "yes", but answer with "In some respects yes, in some respects no".&lt;ref&gt;Arnett, J.J. (in press). Conceptions of the transition to adulthood from adolescence through midlife. ''Journal of Adult Development''&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear from this ambiguity that most emerging adults in the United States feel they have completed adolescence but not yet entered adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnett | first1 = J.J. | year = 1994a | title = Are college students adults? Their conceptions of the transition to adulthood | url = | journal = Journal of Adult Development | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 154–168 | doi=10.1007/bf02277582}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnett | first1 = J.J. | year = 1997 | title = Young People's Conceptions of the Transition to Adulthood | url = http://yas.sagepub.com/content/29/1/3.short | journal = Youth &amp; Society | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 1–23 | doi=10.1177/0044118x97029001001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alone&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnett | first1 = J.

A number of studies have shown that regarding people in their late teens and early twenties in the United States, demographic qualities such as completing their education, finding a career, getting married, and becoming parents are not the criteria used in determining whether they have reached adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnett | first1 = J.J. | year = 1997 | title = Young people's conceptions of the transition to adulthood | url = | journal = Youth &amp; Society | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 1–23 | doi=10.1177/0044118x97029001001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Arnett, J.J.

(1994, February). Adolescents becoming adults: Attributes for adulthood. Poster presented at the biennial meeting of the Society for Research on Adolescence, San Diego, CA&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, the criteria that determine whether adulthood has been reached are character qualities, such as being able to make independent decisions and taking responsibility for one's self.&lt;ref name=alone /&gt;&lt;ref name="Greene, A. L. 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheer, S.D. 1994"/&gt; In America, these character qualities are usually experienced in the mid to late twenties, thus confirming that emerging adulthood is distinct subjectively.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Why emerging adulthood is distinct demographically===
Emerging adulthood is the sole age period where there is nothing that is demographically consistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rindfuss | first1 = R. R. | year = 1991 | title = The Young adult years: Diversity, structural change, and fertility | url = | journal = Demography | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 493–512 | doi=10.2307/2061419}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, C. (1995, April). "How old is young and young is old? The restructuring of age and the life course in Europe". Paper presented at Youth 2000: An International Conference, Middlesbrough, UK&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, adolescents in the United States up to age 20, over 95% live at home with at least one parent, 98% are not married, under 10% have become parents, and more than 95% attend school.&lt;ref name=census&gt;[[United States Census Bureau]]. (1997). "Statistical abstracts of the United States": 1997. Washington, DC: Author&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, people in their thirties are also demographically normative: 75% are married, 75% are parents, and under 10% attend school.&lt;ref name=census /&gt; Residential status and school attendance are two reasons that the period of emerging adulthood is incredibly distinct demographically. Regarding residential status, emerging adults in the United States have very diverse living situations.&lt;ref name=arnett /&gt; About one third of emerging adults attend college and spend a few years living independently while partially relying on adults.&lt;ref name="Goldscheider, F. 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldscheider | first1 = F. | last2 = Goldscheider | first2 = C. | year = 1994 | title = Leaving and returning home in 20th century America | url = | journal = Population Bulletin | volume = 48 | issue = 4| pages = 1–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrastingly, 40% of emerging adults do not attend college but live independently and work full-time.&lt;ref name="Goldscheider, F. 1994"/&gt; Finally, around two-thirds of emerging adults in the United States cohabitate with a romantic partner.&lt;ref&gt;Michael, R. T., Gagnon, J. H., Laumann, E. O., &amp; Kolata, G. (1995). "Sex in America: A definitive survey". New York: Warner Books&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding school attendance, emerging adults are extremely diverse in their educational paths (Arnett, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;470-471). Over 60% of emerging adults in the United States enter college or university the year after they graduate from high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bianchi | first1 = S. M. | last2 = Spain | first2 = D. | year = 1996 | title = Women, work, and family in America | url = | journal = Population Bulletin | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 1–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the years that follow college are extremely diverse – only about 32% of 25- to 29-year-olds have finished four or more years of college.&lt;ref name=census /&gt;

This is because higher education is usually pursued non-continuously, where some pursue education while they also work, and some do not attend school for periods of time.&lt;ref name=arnett /&gt; Further contributing to the variance, about one third of emerging adults with bachelor's degrees pursue a postgraduate education within a year of earning their bachelor's degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mogelonsky | first1 = M. | year = 1996 | title = The rocky road to adulthood | url = | journal = American Demographics | volume = 18 | issue = 26–36| page = 56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, because there is so much demographic instability, especially in residential status and school attendance, it is clear that emerging adulthood is a distinct entity based on its demographically non-normative qualities, at least in the United States. Some emerging adults end up moving back home after college graduation, which tests the demographic of dependency. During college, they may be completely independent, but that could quickly change afterwards when they are trying to find a full-time job with little direction on where to start their career.

==Physiological development==

===Biological changes===
Emerging adulthood and adolescence differ significantly with regard to puberty and hormonal development.&lt;ref name="Eisenberg"/&gt; While there is considerable overlap between the onset of puberty and the developmental stage referred to as adolescence, there are considerably fewer hormonal and physical changes taking place in individuals between the ages of 18–25. Emerging adults have reached a stage of full hormonal maturity and are fully, physically equipped for sexual reproduction.

Emerging adulthood is usually thought of as a time of peak physical health and performance as individuals are usually less susceptible to disease and more physically agile during this period than later stages of adulthood. However, emerging adults are generally more likely to contract [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]], as well as to adopt unhealthy behavioral patterns and lifestyle choices.&lt;ref&gt;Arnett, J. (2012). Adolescence and emerging adulthood: A cultural approach. (5th ed.). Pearson Education Retrieved from http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205892493.pdf{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive development===
While many people believe that the brains of emerging adults are fully developed, they are in fact still developing into their adult forms. Many connections within the brain are strengthened and those that are unused are pruned away.&lt;ref name="Beck"&gt;Beck, M. (2012). "Delayed Development: 20-Somethings Blame the Brain." Retrieved from https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443713704577601532208760746.&lt;/ref&gt; Several brain structures develop that allow for greater processing of emotions and social information. Areas of the brain used for planning and for processing risk and rewards also undergo important developments during this stage.&lt;ref name="Beck"/&gt; These developments in brain structure and the resulting implications are one factor that leads emerging adults to be considered more mature than adolescents. This is due to the fact that they make fewer impulsive decisions and rely more on planning and evaluating of situations.

While brain structures continue to develop during emerging adulthood, the cognition of emerging adults is an area that receives the majority of attention. Arnett explains, "Emerging adulthood is a critical stage for the emergence of complex forms of thinking required in complex societies."&lt;ref name="Arnett, J. 2006"&gt;Arnett, J. (2006). "Emerging Adults in America, Coming of Age in the 21st Century." [[American Psychological Association]].&lt;/ref&gt; Crucial changes take place in their sense of self and capacity for self-reflection. At this stage, emerging adults often decide on a particular worldview and are able to recognize that other perspectives exist and are valid as well.&lt;ref name="Arnett, J. 2006"/&gt; While cognition generally becomes more complex, education level plays an important role in this development.&lt;ref name="Arnett, J. 2006"/&gt; Not all emerging adults reach the same advanced level in cognition because of the variety of education received during this age period.

===Abnormal development===
Much research has been directed at studying the onset of lifetime [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] disorders to dispel the common thought that most disorders begin earlier in life. Because of this reasoning, many people that show signs of disorders do not seek help due to its stigmatization. The research shows that those with various disorders will not feel symptoms until emerging adulthood. Kessler and Merikangas reported that "50% of emerging adults between the ages of 18 and 25 experience at least one psychiatric disorder." Not only is the emergence of various disorders prevalent in emerging adulthood, but the chance of developing a disorder drastically decreases at age 28.&lt;ref name="Kessler 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kessler | first1 = Ronald C. | last2 = Amminger | first2 = G.

Seventy-five percent of any lifetime DSM-IV anxiety, mood, impulse-control and substance abuse disorder begins before age 24.  Most onsets at this age will not be, or become, [[Comorbidity|comorbid]]. The median onset interquartile range of [[substance use disorder]]s is 18–27, while the median onset age is 20. The median onset age of mood disorders is 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kessler | first1 = RC | last2 = Berglund | first2 = P | last3 = Demler | first3 = O | last4 = Jin | first4 = R | last5 = Merikangas | first5 = KR | last6 = Walters | first6 = EE | year = 2005 | title = Lifetime Prevalence and Age-of-Onset Distributions of DSM-IV Disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication | url = | journal = Arch Gen Psychiatry | volume = 62 | issue = 6| pages = 593–602 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.62.6.593 | pmid=15939837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even disorders that begin earlier, like [[Spectrum approach#Broad spectrum approach|schizophrenia spectrum diagnoses]], can reveal themselves within the age range of emerging adulthood. Often, patients will not seek help until several years of symptoms have passed, if at all.&lt;ref name="Kessler 2007" /&gt; For example, those diagnosed with [[social anxiety disorder]] will rarely seek treatment until age 27 or later. Typically, symptoms of more severe disorders, such as [[major depression]], begin at age 25 as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Regier | first1 = Darrel A. | last2 = Rae | first2 = Donald S. | last3 = Narrow | first3 = William E. | last4 = Kaelber | first4 = Charles T. | last5 = Schatzberg | first5 = Alan F. | year = 1998 | title = Prevalence of anxiety disorders and their comorbidity with mood and addictive disorders | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1998-10311-004 | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 173 | issue = 34| pages = 24–8| pmid = 9829013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Melinda.

With the exception of some [[phobia]]s, symptoms of many disorders begin to appear and are diagnosable during emerging adulthood. Major efforts have been taken to educate the public and influence those with symptoms to seek treatment past adolescence. There is minimal but intriguing evidence that those who attend college appear to have less of a chance of showing symptoms of DSM-IV disorders. In one study, "they were significantly less likely to have a diagnosis of drug use disorder or nicotine dependence". In addition, "bipolar disorder was less common in individuals attending college". However, other research reports that chance of alcohol abuse and addiction is increased with college student status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blanco | first1 = Carlos | last2 = Okuda | first2 = Mayumi | last3 = Wright | first3 = Crystal | last4 = Hasin | first4 = Deborah | last5 = Grant | first5 = Bridget | last6 = Liu | first6 = Shang-Min | last7 = Olfson | first7 = Mark | year = 2008 | title = Mental Health of College Students and Their Non–College-Attending Peers Results From the National Epidemiologic Study on Alcohol and Related Conditions | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1998-10311-004 | journal = Arch Gen Psychiatry | volume = 65 | issue = 12| pages = 1429| doi=10.1001/archpsyc.65.12.1429| pmc = 2734947 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationships==

===Parent-child relationship===
Emerging adulthood is characterized by a reevaluation of the [[Parent|parent-child relationship]], primarily in regard to autonomy. As a child switches from the role of a dependent to the role of a fellow adult, the family dynamic changes significantly. At this stage, it is important that parents acknowledge and accept their child's status as an adult.&lt;ref&gt;Blos, P. (1985). "Son and father: Before and beyond the Oedipus complex." ''New York: Free Press''.&lt;/ref&gt; This process may include gestures such as allowing increased amounts of privacy and extending trust. Granting this recognition assists the increasingly independent offspring in forming a strong sense of identity and exploration at a time when it is most crucial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bartle-Haring | first1 = S. | last2 = Brucker | first2 = P. | last3 = Hock | first3 = E. | year = 2002 | title = The impact of parental separation anxiety on identity development in late adolescence and early adulthood | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescent Research | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 439–450 | doi=10.1177/0743558402175001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is varied evidence regarding the continuity of emerging adults' relationships with parents, although most of the research supports the fact that there is moderate stability. A parent-child relationship of higher quality often results in greater affection and contact in emerging adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Belsky | first1 = J. | last2 = Jaffee | first2 = S. | last3 = Hsieh | first3 = K. | last4 = Silva | first4 = P. | year = 2001 | title = Child-rearing antecedents of intergenerational relations in young adulthood: A prospective study | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 801–813 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.37.6.801}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Attachment theory|Attachment styles]] tend to remain stable from infancy to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = E. | last2 = Weinfield | first2 = N.

E. | year = 2000 | title = The stability of attachment security from infancy to adolescence and early adulthood | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 703–706 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00179}}&lt;/ref&gt; An initial secure attachment assists in healthy separation from parents while still retaining intimacy, resulting in adaptive psychological function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leondari | first1 = A. | last2 = Kiosseoglou | first2 = G. | year = 2000 | title = The relationship of parental attachment and psychological separation to the psychological functioning of young adults | url = | journal = Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 140 | issue = | pages = 451–464 | doi=10.1080/00224540009600484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in attachment are often associated with negative life events, as described below.

[[Divorce]] and remarriage of parents often result in a weaker parent-child relationship,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aquilino | first1 = W | year = 1994a | title = Impact of childhood family structure on young adults' relationships with parents | url = | journal = Journal of Marriage and the Family | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 295–313 | doi=10.2307/353101}}&lt;/ref&gt; even if no adverse effects were apparent during childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cherlin | first1 = A. J. | last2 = Chase-Lansdale | first2 = P. L. | last3 = McRae | first3 = C. | year = 1998 | title = Effects of parental divorce on mental health throughout the life course | url = | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 239–249 | doi=10.2307/2657325}}&lt;/ref&gt; When parental divorce occurs in early adulthood, it has a strong, negative impact on the child's relationship with their father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aquilino | first1 = W | year = 1994b | title = Later-life parental divorce and widow-hood: Impact on young adults' assessment of parent-child relations | url = | journal = Journal of Marriage and the Family | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 908–922 | doi=10.2307/353602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, if parents and children maintain a good relationship throughout the divorce process, it could act as a buffer and reduce the negative effects of the experience. A positive parent-child relationship after parental divorce may also be facilitated by the child's understanding of divorce. Understanding the complexity of the situation and not dwelling on the negative aspects may actually assist a young adult's adjustment, as well as their success in their own romantic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shulman | first1 = S. | last2 = Scharf | first2 = M. | last3 = Lumer | first3 = D. | last4 = Maurer | first4 = O. | year = 2001 | title = How young adults perceive parental divorce: The role of their relationships with their fathers and mothers | url = | journal = Journal of Divorce and Remarriage | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 3–17 | doi=10.1300/j087v34n03_02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mahl | first1 = D | year = 2001 | title = The influence of parental divorce on the romantic relationship beliefs of young adults | url = | journal = Journal of Divorce and Remarriage | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 89–118 | doi=10.1300/j087v34n03_06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the increasing need for autonomy that emerging adults experience, there is also a continuing need for support from parents, although this need is often different and less dependent than that of children and earlier adolescents. Many people over the age of 18 still require financial support in order to further their education and career,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Semyonov | first1 = M. | last2 = Lewin-Epstein | first2 = N. | year = 2001 | title = The impact of parental transfers on living standards of married children | url = | journal = Social Indicators Research | volume = 54 | issue = | pages = 115–137 | doi=10.1023/a:1011081529592}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite an otherwise independent lifestyle. Furthermore, emotional support remains important during this transition period. Parental engagement with low marital conflict results in better adjustment for college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nicholson | first1 = J. | last2 = Phillips | first2 = M. | last3 = Peterson | first3 = C. | last4 = Battistutta | first4 = D. | year = 2002 | title = Relationship between the parenting styles of biological parents and stepparents and the adjustment of young adult stepchildren | url = | journal = Journal of Divorce and Remarriage | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 57–76 | doi=10.1300/j087v36n03_04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This balance of autonomy and dependency may seem contradictory, but relinquishing control while providing necessary support may strengthen the bond between parents and offspring and may even provide space for children to be viewed as sources of support.&lt;ref&gt;Aquilino, W. (2006). "Family Relationships and Support Systems in Emerging Adulthood." In J. J. Arnett (Ed.) ''Emerging adults in America: Coming of age in the 21st century.'' (pp. 193-217). Washington, DC, US: [[American Psychological Association]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Parental support may come in the form of co-residence, which has varied effects on an emerging adult's adjustment. The proportion of young adults living with their parents has steadily increased in recent years, largely due to financial strain, difficulty finding employment, and the necessity of higher education in the job field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Census Bureau agrees with parents: Yes, young adults still home |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/nationnow/2011/11/census-bureau-more-young-adults-live-with-parents.html |work=Los Angeles Times |date=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economic benefit of a period of co-residence may assist an emerging adult in exploration of career options. In households with lower socioeconomic status, this arrangement may have the added benefit of the young adult providing support for the family, both financial and otherwise.

Co-residence can also have negative effects on an emerging adult's adjustment and autonomy. This may hinder parents' ability to acknowledge their child as an adult,&lt;ref&gt;White, N. R. (2002). "Not under my roof! Young people's experience of home." ''Youth &amp; Society,34'', 214–231.&lt;/ref&gt; while home-leaving promotes psychological growth and satisfying adult-to-adult relationships with parents characterized by less confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;Arnett, J. J. (2004). "Emerging adulthood: The winding road from the late teens through the twenties." ''New York: Oxford University Press.''&lt;/ref&gt; Living in physically separate households can help both a young adult and a parent acknowledge the changing nature of their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Dubas, J. S., &amp; Petersen, A. C. (1996). "Geographical distance from parents and adjustment during adolescence and young adulthood." In J. Graber &amp; J. Dubas (Eds.), "New directions for child development: Vol. 71. Leaving home: Understanding the transition to adulthood" (pp. 3—20). ''San Francisco: Jossey-Bass''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual relationships===
There are a wide variety of factors that influence [[sexual relationship]]s during emerging adulthood; this includes beliefs about certain sexual behaviors and marriage. For example, among emerging adults in the United States, it is common for [[oral sex]] to not be considered "real sex".&lt;ref name = "Eisenberg"&gt;Eisenberg, M. E. (2010). Sex in Emerging Adulthood: A Decade in the Sexual Gap.''Changing Sea''. Retrieved September 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s and 1960s, about 75% of people between the ages of 20–24 engaged in [[premarital sex]]. Today, that number is 90%.&lt;ref name = "Eisenberg" /&gt; [[Unintended pregnancy]] and [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections and diseases]] (STIs/STDs) are a central issue. As individuals move through emerging adulthood, they are more likely to engage in monogamous sexual relationships and practice [[safe sex]].&lt;ref name = "Eisenberg" /&gt;

Across most OECD countries, marriage rates are falling, the [[age at first marriage]] is rising,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/els/family/SF_3_1_Marriage_and_divorce_rates.pdf|publisher=OECD|work=OECD Family Database|title=Marriage and divorce rates}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cohabitation]] among unmarried couples is increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/SF3_3_Cohabitation_rate_and_prevalence_of_other_forms_of_partnership_Jan2013.pdf|title=Cohabitation rate and prevalence of other forms of partnership|publisher=OECD|work=OECD Family Database}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Western European marriage pattern]] has traditionally been characterised by marriage in the mid twenties, especially for women, with a generally small age difference between the spouses, a significant proportion of women who remain unmarried, and the establishment of a [[Neolocal residence|neolocal household]] after the couple has married.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Linda. (2010). ''Kinship and Gender''. Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press, pp. 231–36, {{ISBN|0813344026}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Phillipp R. (2003).

[[Housing affordability]] has been linked to [[Owner-occupancy|home ownership]] rates, and [[Demography|demographic research]]ers have argued for a link between the rising age at first marriage and the rising age of first home ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/submissions/housing-and-housing-finance/inquiry-into-home-ownership/home-ownership-rates.html|title=Home Ownership Rates - Submission to the Inquiry into Home Ownership June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/economists/tracy/7519_Transition_to_Homeownership.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mainstreet.com/article/why-first-time-homebuyers-are-waiting-to-buy-houses-until-after-marriage |title=Why First-Time Homebuyers Are Waiting to Buy a House Until After Marriage - MainStreet |date=13 April 2016 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413021546/https://www.mainstreet.com/article/why-first-time-homebuyers-are-waiting-to-buy-houses-until-after-marriage |archivedate=2016-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://universe.byu.edu/2011/10/11/average-age-of-first-time-homeowners-remains-high/ |title=Average age of first-time homeowners remains high – The Daily Universe |date=10 July 2016 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710202225/http://universe.byu.edu/2011/10/11/average-age-of-first-time-homeowners-remains-high/ |archivedate=2016-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/11/record-share-of-young-women-are-living-with-their-parents-relatives/|title=Record share of young women are living with their parents, relatives|date=11 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Demographers distinguish between developing countries, which constitute more than 80% of the world's population,&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Development Programme (2006). Human Development Report, 2006. New York: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; and the economically advanced, industrialized nations that form the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). This includes countries like the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, South Korea, and Australia, all of which have significantly higher median incomes and educational attainment and significantly lower rates of illness, disease, and early death.&lt;ref name="Cultural Psychology"&gt;Arnett, J.J.  (2011). "Emerging adulthood(s): The Cultural Psychology of a New Life Stage." In ''L.A. Jensen (Ed.)'', "Bridging cultural and developmental approaches to psychology: New Synthesis in theory, research, and policy," (pp. 255–275). New York: [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of emerging adulthood is specifically applicable to cultures within these OECD nations,&lt;ref name="Cultural Psychology"/&gt; and as a stage of development has only emerged over the past half century.&lt;ref name=" What Is It?"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnett | first1 = J. J. | year = 2007 | title = Emerging Adulthood: What Is It, and What Is It Good For? | url = | journal = Child Development Perspectives | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 68–73 | doi = 10.1111/j.1750-8606.2007.00016.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is specific to "certain cultural-demographic conditions, specifically widespread education and training beyond secondary school and entry into marriage and parenthood in the late twenties (or early thirties) or beyond".&lt;ref&gt;Arnett, J.J.  (2011). Emerging adulthood(s): The Cultural Psychology of a New Life Stage. In L.A. Jensen (Ed.), Bridging cultural and developmental approaches to psychology: New Synthesis in theory, research, and policy (pp. 255–275). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, emerging adulthood occurs only within societies that allow for occupational shifts, with emerging adults often experiencing frequent job changes before settling on particular job by the age of 30.&lt;ref name=" What Is It?"/&gt;  Arnett also argues that emerging adulthood happens in cultures that allow for a period of time between adolescence and marriage, the marker of adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arnett|first1=Jeffrey|title=Emerging Adulthood: A Theory of Development From the Late Teens Through the Twenties|journal=American Psychologist|date=2000|pages=469–480|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.55.5.469|volume=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such marital and occupational instability found among emerging adults can be attributed to the strong sense of individualization found in cultures that allow for this stage of development; in individualized cultures, traditional familial and institutional constraints have become less pronounced than in previous times or in unindustrialized/developing cultures, allowing for more personal freedom in life decisions.&lt;ref name=" What Is It?"/&gt; However, emerging adulthood even occurs in industrialized nations that do not value individualization, as is the case in some Asian countries discussed below.

Up until the latter portion of the 20th century in OECD countries, and contemporarily in developing countries around the world, young people made the transition from adolescence to young adulthood around or by the age of 22, when they settled into long-lasting, obligation-filled familial and occupational roles.&lt;ref name="Cultural Psychology"/&gt; Therefore, in societies where this trend still prevails, emerging adulthood does not exist as a widespread stage of development.

Among OECD countries, there is a general "one size fits all" model in regards to emerging adulthood, having all undergone the same demographic changes that resulted in this new stage of development between adolescence and young adulthood. However, the shape emerging adulthood takes can even vary between different OECD countries,&lt;ref name="Cultural Psychology"/&gt; and researchers have only recently begun exploring such cross-national differences.&lt;ref name=" What Is It?"/&gt; For instance, researchers have determined that Europe is the area where emerging adulthood lasts the longest, with high levels of government assistance and median marriage ages nearing 30,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Douglas | first1 = C.B. | year = 2007 | title = From duty to desire: Emerging adulthood in Europe and its consequences | url = | journal = Child Development Perspectives | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 101–108 | doi=10.1111/j.1750-8606.2007.00023.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to the U.S. where the median marriage age is 27.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Census Bureau]] (2009). Statistical abstract of the United States. Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emerging adult communities in East Asia may be most dissimilar from their European and American counterparts, for while they share the benefits of affluent societies with strong education and welfare systems, they do not share as strong a sense of individualization. Historically and currently, East Asian cultures have emphasized collectivism more so than those in the West.&lt;ref name="Cultural Psychology"/&gt; For instance, while Asian emerging adults similarly engage in individualistic identity exploration and personal development, they do so within more constrictive boundaries set by familial obligation. For example, European and American emerging adults consistently list financial independence as a key marker of adulthood, while Asian emerging adults consistently list capable of supporting parents financially as a marker with equal weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = L.J. | last2 = Badger | first2 = S. | last3 = Wu | first3 = B. | year = 2004 | title = The influence of culture in emerging adulthood: Perspectives of Chinese college students | url = | journal = International Journal of Behavioral Development | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 26–36 | doi=10.1080/01650250344000244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, while casual dating and premarital sex has become normative in the West, in Asia parents still discourage such practices, where they remain "rare and forbidden".&lt;ref name="Cultural Psychology"/&gt; In fact, about 75% of emerging adults in the U.S. and Europe report having had premarital sexual relations by the age of 20, whereas less than 20% in Japan and South Korea reported the same.&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield, E., &amp; Rapson, R. L. (2006). Love and sex: Cross-cultural perspectives. New York: University Press of America.&lt;/ref&gt;

While emerging adulthood exemplars are found mainly within the middle and upper classes of OECD countries, the stage of development still seems to occur across classes, with the main difference between different ones being length—on average, young people in lower social classes tend to enter adulthood two years before those in upper classes.&lt;ref name="Cultural Psychology"/&gt;

While emerging adulthood occurs on a wide scale only in OECD countries, developing countries may also exhibit similar phenomena in certain population subgroups. In contrast to those in poor or rural parts of developing nations, who have no emerging adulthood and sometimes no adolescence due to comparatively early entry into marriage and adult-like work, young people in wealthier urban classes have begun to enter stages of development that resemble emerging adulthood, and the amount to do so is rising.&lt;ref name="Cultural Psychology"/&gt; Such individuals may develop a bicultural or hybrid identity, with part of themselves identifying with local culture and another part participating in the professional culture of the global economy. One finds examples of such a situation among the middle class young people in India, who lead the globalized economic sector while still, for the most part, preferring to have arranged marriages and taking care of their parents in old age.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhary, N., &amp; Sharma, N. (2007). India. In J.J. Arnett (Ed.) International encyclopedia of adolescence (pp. 4420459). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  While it is more common for emerging adulthood to occur in OECD countries, it is not always true that all young people of those societies have the opportunity to experience these years of change and exploration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Media==
Emerging adulthood is not just an idea being talked about by psychologists, the media has propagated the concept as well. [[Hollywood]] has produced multiple movies where the main conflict seems to be a "grown" adult's reluctance to actually "grow" up and take on responsibility. ''[[Failure to Launch]]'' and ''[[Step Brothers (film)|Step Brothers]]'' are extreme examples of this concept. While most takes on emerging adulthood (and the problems that it can cause) are shown in a light-humored attempt to poke fun at the idea, a few films have taken a more serious approach to the plight. ''[[Adventureland (film)|Adventureland]]'', ''[[Take Me Home Tonight (film)|Take Me Home Tonight]]'', ''[[Cyrus (2010 comedy-drama film)|Cyrus]]'' and ''[[Jeff, Who Lives at Home]]'' are comedy-dramas that exhibit the plight of today's emerging adult. Television also is capitalizing on the concept of emerging adulthood with sitcoms such as ''[[$h*! My Dad Says]]'' and ''[[Big Lake (TV series)|Big Lake]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/magazine/22Adulthood-t.html?_r=4&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;adxnnlx=1348760895-hf3X3qwNQJMSlhtRsTjX6Q | work=The New York Times | title=What Is It About 20-Somethings? | date=August 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is not just on television where society sees the world becoming aware of this trend. In spring 2010, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine showcased a picture of a post-grad hanging his [[PhD]] on the wall of his bedroom as his parents stood in the doorway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thegloss.com/career/whats-the-matter-with-kids-today/|title=What's The Matter With Kids Today?|date=19 August 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; People do not have to seek out these media sources to find documentation of the emerging adulthood phenomenon. News sources about the topic are abundant. Nationwide, it is being found that people entering their 20s are faced with multitudes of living problems creating problems that this age group has received a lot of attention for. The [[Occupy movement]] is an example of what has happened to the youth of today and exhibits the frustration of today's emerging adults. Other television shows and films showcasing emerging/early adulthood are ''[[Girls (TV series)|Girls]]'', ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', and ''[[Less Than Zero (film)|Less Than Zero]].''

== Criticism ==

The concept of emerging adulthood has not been without its criticisms. Sociologists have pinpointed that it neglects class differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bynner|first=J.|date=2005|title=Rethinking the youth phase of the life course: The case for emerging adulthood?|url=|journal=Journal of Youth Studies|volume=8|pages=367–384|via=|doi=10.1080/13676260500431628}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it might be true that middle class children in Western societies are spoiled for choice and can afford to postpone life decisions, there are other young people who have no choices at all, and stay in the parental home not because they want to, but because they cannot afford a life of their own: They experience a period of "arrested adulthood".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Arrested adulthood: The changing nature of identity-maturity in the late-modern world.|last=Côté|first=James|publisher=New York University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more theoretical criticism comes from developmental psychologists, who regard all stage theories as outdated. They argue that development is a dynamic interactive process, which is different for every individual, because every individual has their own experiences. Inventing a stage that only describes (not explains) a time period in the life of a few individuals (mostly white middle class young people living in Western societies within this decade), and has nothing to say about people living in different conditions or different points in history is not a scientific approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hendry|first=L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5765">'''Environmental restoration''' is a term common in the citizens’ [[environmental movement]].  '''Environmental restoration''' is closely allied with (or perhaps sometimes used interchangeably with) ''[[ecological restoration]]'' or ''[[environmental remediation]]''.  In the U.S., remediation is the term used more in the realms of industry, public policy, and the civil services.

In the 1987 edition of his book ''Restoring the Earth: How Americans are Working to Renew our Damaged Environment'', scientific editor and writer [[John Berger (author)|John J. Berger]] defined environmental restoration (or “natural resource restoration”) as follows: ''"… A process in which a damaged resource is renewed.  Biologically. Structurally. Functionally."''

==Natural environment==
The ongoing growth of human population in the world and its associated impacts,{{why|date=March 2012}} mean that the need for ecological restoration has become increasingly clear.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} The old adage "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" points to the fact that ecological restoration is not always successful (or only over long spans of time) and, when feasible, is often difficult and expensive. Environmental restoration is often neglected, either being overlooked or being deemed inexpedient or of a low priority. However, in much of the industrialized world, it has been increasingly demanded by the public, at least since the early 1970s if not before.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The interest and activity in environmental restoration has given rise to a new branch of research and applied techniques within biology, [[restoration ecology]].

Environmental restoration has been applied in aquatic situations ([[lake]]s, [[stream]]s, [[river]]s, [[wetland]]s, etc.) and terrestrial ones (grasslands, [[forest]]s, [[desert]]s, flatlands, hill country, mountain slopes, etc.).

==Approaches==
Environmental restoration involves many different approaches and technologies depending on the requirements of the situation. It can involve [[heavy equipment]] like cranes, [[grader]]s, [[bulldozer]]s, or [[excavator]]s, and also hand processes like the planting of trees and other vegetation. It can involve high-tech processes such as those applied in the careful environmental control required in fish-hatchery procedures. Today, computerized regulation is often being utilized in these processes. Computer-based mapping has also become an important dimension of restorative work, as has [[computer modeling]].

In some situations, environmental restorative work is handled entirely by professionals working with skilled operators and technicians. In others, ordinary local community members may do much of the work, acquiring skills as the project proceeds. An example of this approach can be seen in Project Maitai&lt;ref&gt;[https://arcg.is/1XCCrj Project Maitai]&lt;/ref&gt; where the Nelson City Council, New Zealand, has worked with community groups, such as Friends of the Maitai and local schools, to restore the [[Maitai River]] and its tributaries.

==Ecological restoration markets==
Although the international field of restoration is driven primarily by the non-profit, government and academic sectors, in the U.S and certain other countries (e.g. Australia, which has a robust mining restoration sector), there are active markets for ecological restoration. The U.S. market blossomed shortly after U.S. created a law that prevents the loss of streams and wetlands under the [[Clean Water Act]] and in the wake of the passage of the [[Endangered Species Act]]. The Under Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 also created restoration opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zipper|first1=CE|last2=Burger|first2=JA|last3=Skousen|first3=JG|last4=Angel|first4=PN|title=Restoring forests and associated ecosystem services on appalachian coal surface mines|journal=Environmental management|volume=47|issue=5|pages=751–756|doi=10.1007/s00267-011-9670-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; When regulations stemming from these laws came online in the mid-1980s, there were few firms that were qualified or experienced in performing large-scale restoration projects. The first estimate of the dollars and jobs in the U.S. was $9.5 billion in annual sales, with 126,000 people employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=BenDor|first1=JM|last2=Newton|first2=AC|last3=Diaz|first3=A|last4=Bullock|first4=JM|title=Estimating the Size and Impact of the Ecological Restoration Economy|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2015|volume=10|issue=6|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0128339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6911">'''Fenton's reagent''' is a solution of [[hydrogen peroxide]] with [[ferrous]] iron as a [[catalyst]] that is used to [[oxidize]] [[contaminants]] or [[waste water]]s. Fenton's reagent can be used to destroy [[organic compound]]s such as [[trichloroethylene]] (TCE) and [[tetrachloroethylene]] (perchloroethylene, PCE). It was developed in the 1890s by [[Henry John Horstman Fenton]] as an analytical reagent.&lt;ref name="Fenton1894"&gt;{{cite journal

== Overview ==
Iron(II) is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide to [[iron(III)]], forming a [[hydroxyl radical]] and a [[hydroxide ion]] in the process. Iron(III) is then reduced back to iron(II) by another molecule of hydrogen peroxide, forming a [[hydroperoxyl]] radical and a [[hydrogen atom|proton]]. The net effect is a [[disproportionation]] of hydrogen peroxide to create two different oxygen-radical species, with water ({{math|size=100%|H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;}}) as a byproduct.

{{NumBlk|:| Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + HO• + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
{{NumBlk|:| Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + HOO• + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

The [[free radical]]s generated by this process then engage in secondary reactions. For example, the hydroxyl is a powerful, non-selective oxidant. Oxidation of an organic compound by Fenton's reagent is rapid and [[exothermic]] and results in the oxidation of contaminants to primarily carbon dioxide and water.&lt;ref&gt;http://geocleanse.com/fentonsreagent.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Reaction ({{EquationNote|1}}) was suggested by [[Fritz Haber|Haber]] and Weiss in the 1930s as part of what would become the [[Haber–Weiss reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Haber, F.  |author2=Weiss, J. | year = 1932 | title = Über die Katalyse des Hydroperoxydes | journal = [[Naturwissenschaften]] | doi = 10.1007/BF0150471|volume = 20|issue = 51|pages = 948–950}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iron(II) sulfate]] is typically used as the iron catalyst. The exact mechanisms of the redox cycle are uncertain, and non-OH• oxidizing mechanisms of organic compounds have also been suggested.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Therefore, it may be appropriate to broadly discuss ''Fenton chemistry'' rather than a specific ''Fenton reaction''.

In the electro-Fenton process, hydrogen peroxide is produced ''in situ'' from the [[electrochemical reduction]] of oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Juan Casado |author2=Jordi Fornaguera |author3=Maria I. Galan |title=Mineralization of Aromatics in Water by Sunlight-Assisted Electro-Fenton Technology in a Pilot Reactor  |journal=Environ. Sci. Technol. |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=1843–47 |date=January 2005 |pmid= 15819245|doi= 10.1021/es0498787|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/esthag/2005/39/i06/abs/es0498787.html|bibcode=2005EnST...39.1843C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fenton's reagent is also used in [[organic synthesis]] for the [[hydroxylation]] of [[arene]]s in a [[radical substitution]] reaction such as the classical conversion of [[benzene]] into [[phenol]].

{{NumBlk|:| C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + FeSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

A recent hydroxylation example involves the [[organic oxidation|oxidation]] of [[barbituric acid]] to [[alloxane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brömme HJ, Mörke W, Peschke E |title=Transformation of barbituric acid into alloxan by hydroxyl radicals: interaction with melatonin and with other hydroxyl radical scavengers |journal=J. Pineal Res. |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=239–47 |date=November 2002 |pmid=12390507 |doi= 10.1034/j.1600-079X.2002.02936.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another application of the reagent in organic synthesis is in [[coupling reaction]]s of alkanes. As an example [[Tert-Butanol|''tert''-butanol]] is dimerized with Fenton's reagent and [[sulfuric acid]] to 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-hexanediol.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | collvol = 5  |  collvolpages = 1026 | prep = cv5p1026 | title =  α,α,α',α'-Tetramethyltetramethylene  glycol | author = E. L. Jenner | year = 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biomedical applications==
The Fenton reaction has importance in biology because it involves the creation of free radicals by chemicals that are present in vivo. Transition-metal ions such as iron and copper donate or accept free electrons via intracellular reactions and help in creating free radicals. Most intracellular iron is in [[ferric]] (+3 ion) form and must be reduced to the [[ferrous]] (+2) form to take part in Fenton reaction. Superoxide ions and transition metals act in a synergistic manner in the creation of free radical damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robbins|author2=Cotran|last-author-amp=yes|title=Pathologic Basis of Disease|edition=7th|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780808923022|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, although the clinical significance is still unclear, it is one of the viable reason to avoid iron supplementation in patients with active infections, whereas other reasons include iron-mediated infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lapointe|first=Marc|date=2004-01-01|title=Iron supplementation in the intensive care unit: when, how much, and by what route?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/cc2825|journal=Critical Care|volume=8|issue=2|pages=1–5|doi=10.1186/cc2825|issn=1364-8535|pmc=3226152|pmid=15196322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''frog pond effect''' is the [[theory]] that individuals evaluate themselves as worse when in a group of higher performing individuals.

The frog pond effect is a part of the wider [[social comparison theory]].  It relates to how [[Self-evaluation motives|individuals evaluate themselves]] based on comparisons to other people around them, and is generally due to upward comparisons. Davis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=James|title=The Campus as a Frog Pond: An Application of the Theory of Relative Deprivation to Career Decisions of College Men|year=1966|url=http://www.utexas.edu/law/journals/tlr/sources/Volume%2092/Issue%206/Sander/Final%20Sourcelist%20Sourcepull/Sander.fn035.frogpond.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; first noticed this effect when he discovered that students evaluated their performance as worse based on their peers from their school. MacFarland and Buehler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=1995|last1=MacFarland|first1=Cathy|last2=Beuhler|first2=Roger|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/68/6/1055.html|title=Collective Self-Esteem as a Moderator of the Frog-Pond Effect in Reactions to Performance Feedback}}&lt;/ref&gt; theorized that the effect happens because individuals self-monitor within-group rather than compare across groups.  Individuals are affected by the frog pond effect the most when they come from an [[individualistic culture]], lack strong social connections, and have low collective [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;MacFarland and Beuhler, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geophysics''' {{IPAc-en|dʒ|iː|oʊ|f|ɪ|z|ɪ|k|s}} is a subject of [[natural science]] concerned with the physical processes and physical properties of the [[Earth]] and its surrounding space environment, and the use of quantitative methods for their analysis. The term ''geophysics'' sometimes refers only to the geological applications: Earth's [[figure of the Earth|shape]]; its [[gravitational]] and [[Earth's magnetic field|magnetic fields]]; its [[structure of the Earth|internal structure]] and [[Earth#Composition|composition]]; its [[geodynamics|dynamics]] and their surface expression in [[plate tectonics]], the generation of [[magma]]s, [[volcanism]] and rock formation.&lt;ref name=Sheriff1991&gt;{{harvnb|Sheriff|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern geophysics organizations use a broader definition that includes the [[water cycle]] including snow and ice; [[geophysical fluid dynamics|fluid dynamics]] of the oceans and the [[atmosphere]]; [[atmospheric electricity|electricity]] and [[magnetism]] in the [[ionosphere]] and [[magnetosphere]] and solar-terrestrial relations; and analogous problems associated with the [[Moon]] and other planets.&lt;ref name=Sheriff1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=IUGG&gt;{{harvnb|IUGG|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AGUscience&gt;{{harvnb|AGU|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although geophysics was only recognized as a separate discipline in the 19th century, its origins date back to ancient times. The first magnetic compasses were made from [[lodestone]]s, while more modern magnetic compasses played an important role in the history of navigation. The first seismic instrument was built in 132 AD. [[Isaac Newton]] applied his theory of mechanics to the tides and the [[precession of the equinox]]; and instruments were developed to measure the Earth's shape, density and gravity field, as well as the components of the water cycle. In the 20th century, geophysical methods were developed for remote exploration of the solid Earth and the ocean, and geophysics played an essential role in the development of the theory of plate tectonics.

Geophysics is applied to societal needs, such as [[mineral resources]], mitigation of [[natural hazards]] and [[environmental protection]].&lt;ref name=IUGG/&gt;  In [[Exploration geophysics|Exploration Geophysics]], [[Geophysical survey]] data are used to analyze potential petroleum reservoirs and mineral deposits, locate groundwater, find archaeological relics, determine the thickness of glaciers and soils, and assess sites for environmental remediation.

The gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun give rise to two high tides and two low tides every lunar day, or every 24 hours and 50 minutes. Therefore, there is a gap of 12 hours and 25 minutes between every high tide and between every low tide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|1995|pp=236–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravitational forces make rocks press down on deeper rocks, increasing their density as the depth increases.&lt;ref name=Poirier&gt;{{harvnb|Poirier|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of [[gravitational acceleration]] and [[gravitational potential]] at the Earth's surface and above it can be used to look for mineral deposits (see [[gravity anomaly]] and [[gravimetry]]).&lt;ref name=Telford/&gt; The surface gravitational field provides information on the dynamics of [[tectonic plates]]. The [[geopotential]] surface called the [[geoid]] is one definition of the shape of the Earth. The geoid would be the global mean sea level if the oceans were in equilibrium and could be extended through the continents (such as with very narrow canals).&lt;ref name=Lowrie/&gt;

=== Heat flow ===
{{Main|Geothermal gradient}}
[[Image:Convection-snapshot.gif|thumb|260px|A model of [[thermal convection]] in the [[Earth's mantle]]. The thin red columns are [[mantle plumes]]. |alt=Pseudocolor image in vertical profile.]]
The Earth is cooling, and the resulting [[heat flow]] generates the Earth's magnetic field through the [[geodynamo]] and plate tectonics through [[mantle convection]].&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main sources of heat are the primordial heat and [[radioactivity]], although there are also contributions from [[phase transitions]]. Heat is mostly carried to the surface by [[thermal convection]], although there are two thermal boundary layers – the [[core-mantle boundary]] and the [[lithosphere]] – in which heat is transported by [[Conduction (heat)|conduction]].&lt;ref name=Fowler&gt;{{harvnb|Fowler|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some heat is carried up from the bottom of the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] by [[mantle plumes]]. The heat flow at the Earth's surface is about {{math| 4.2 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; W}}, and it is a potential source of [[geothermal]] energy.&lt;ref name=Pollack&gt;{{harvnb|Pollack|Hurter|Johnson|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vibrations ===
{{Main|Seismology}}
[[Image:Pswaves.jpg|thumb|260px|Illustration of the deformations of a block by body waves and surface waves (see [[seismic wave]]). |alt=Deformed blocks with grids on surface.]]
[[Seismic wave]]s are vibrations that travel through the Earth's interior or along its surface. The entire Earth can also oscillate in forms that are called [[normal modes]] or [[seismic wave#Free oscillations of the Earth|free oscillations of the Earth]]. Ground motions from waves or normal modes are measured using [[seismograph]]s. If the waves come from a localized source such as an earthquake or explosion, measurements at more than one location can be used to locate the source. The locations of earthquakes provide information on plate tectonics and mantle convection.&lt;ref name=Shearer&gt;{{cite book|last=Shearer|first=Peter M.|title=Introduction to seismology|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521708425|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stein&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|Wysession|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measurements of seismic waves are a source of information on the region that the waves travel through. If the density or composition of the rock changes suddenly, some waves are reflected. [[Reflection seismology|Reflections]] can provide information on near-surface structure.&lt;ref name=Telford&gt;{{harvnb|Telford|Geldart|Sheriff|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the travel direction, called [[Seismic refraction|refraction]], can be used to infer the [[Earth's interior|deep structure of the Earth]].&lt;ref name=Stein/&gt;

Earthquakes pose a [[Earthquakes#Effects/impacts of earthquakes|risk to humans]]. Understanding their mechanisms, which depend on the type of earthquake (e.g., [[Intraplate earthquake|intraplate]] or [[Deep focus earthquake|deep focus]]), can lead to better estimates of earthquake risk and improvements in [[earthquake engineering]].&lt;ref name=Bozorgnia2004&gt;{{harvnb|Bozorgnia|Bertero|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electricity ===
Although we mainly notice electricity during [[thunderstorms]], there is always a downward electric field near the surface that averages 120 [[volt]]s per meter.&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;{{harvnb|Harrison|Carslaw|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relative to the solid Earth, the atmosphere has a net positive charge due to bombardment by [[cosmic rays]]. A current of about 1800 [[ampere]]s flows in the global circuit.&lt;ref name=Harrison/&gt; It flows downward from the ionosphere over most of the Earth and back upwards through thunderstorms. The flow is manifested by lightning below the clouds and [[sprite (lightning)|sprite]]s above.

A variety of electric methods are used in geophysical survey. Some measure [[spontaneous potential]], a potential that arises in the ground because of man-made or natural disturbances. [[Telluric current]]s flow in Earth and the oceans. They have two causes: [[electromagnetic induction]] by the time-varying, external-origin [[geomagnetic field]] and motion of conducting bodies (such as seawater) across the Earth's permanent magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lanzerotti|Gregori|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution of telluric current density can be used to detect variations in [[electrical resistivity]] of underground structures. Geophysicists can also provide the electric current themselves (see [[induced polarization]] and [[electrical resistivity tomography]]).

=== Electromagnetic waves ===

[[Electromagnetic waves]] occur in the ionosphere and magnetosphere as well as the Earth's [[outer core]]. [[Dawn chorus (electromagnetic)|Dawn chorus]] is believed to be caused by high-energy electrons that get caught in the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]. [[Whistler (radio)|Whistlers]] are produced by [[lightning]] strikes. [[Hiss (electromagnetic)|Hiss]] may be generated by both. Electromagnetic waves may also be generated by earthquakes (see [[seismo-electromagnetics]]).

In the highly conductive liquid iron of the outer core, magnetic fields are generated by electric currents through electromagnetic induction. [[Alfvén wave]]s are [[magnetohydrodynamic]] waves in the magnetosphere or the Earth's core. In the core, they probably have little observable effect on the Earth's magnetic field, but slower waves such as magnetic [[Rossby wave]]s may be one source of [[geomagnetic secular variation]].&lt;ref name=Merrill/&gt;

Electromagnetic methods that are used for geophysical survey include [[transient electromagnetics]], [[magnetotellurics]] and electromagnetic seabed logging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stéphane |first1=Sainson |title=Electromagnetic seabed logging : a new tool for geoscientists |date=2017 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-45355-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magnetism ===
{{further|Earth's magnetic field|Aeromagnetic survey|Paleomagnetism}}
The Earth's magnetic field protects the Earth from the deadly [[solar wind]] and has long been used for navigation. It originates in the fluid motions of the outer core.&lt;ref name=Merrill/&gt; The magnetic field in the upper atmosphere gives rise to the [[Aurora (astronomy)|auroras]].&lt;ref name=Kivelson&gt;{{harvnb|Kivelson|Russell|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Geomagnetisme.svg|thumb|left|200px|Earth's dipole axis (pink line) is tilted away from the rotational axis (blue line). |alt=Diagram with field lines, axes and magnet lines.]]
The Earth's field is roughly like a tilted [[dipole]], but it changes over time (a phenomenon called geomagnetic secular variation). Mostly the [[geomagnetic pole]] stays near the [[geographic pole]], but at random intervals averaging 440,000 to a million years or so, the polarity of the Earth's field reverses. These [[geomagnetic reversals]], analyzed within a [[Geomagnetic reversal#Geomagnetic polarity time scale|Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale]], contain 184 polarity intervals in the last 83 million years, with change in frequency over time, with the most recent brief complete reversal of the [[Laschamp event]] occurring 41,000 years ago during the [[Glacial period#Last glacial period|last glacial period]]. Geologists observed [[Geomagnetic reversal#History|geomagnetic reversal recorded]] in volcanic rocks, through [[Magnetostratigraphy#Correlation and ages|magnetostratigraphy correlation]] (see [[natural remanent magnetization]]) and their signature can be seen as parallel linear magnetic anomaly stripes on the seafloor. These stripes provide quantitative information on [[seafloor spreading]], a part of plate tectonics. They are the basis of [[magnetostratigraphy]], which correlates magnetic reversals with other stratigraphies to construct geologic time scales.&lt;ref name=Opdyke&gt;{{harvnb|Opdyke|Channell|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[paleomagnetism|magnetization in rocks]] can be used to measure the motion of continents.&lt;ref name=Merrill/&gt;

=== Radioactivity ===
{{further|Radiometric dating}}
[[Image:Thorium decay chain from lead-212 to lead-208.svg|thumb|240px|Example of a radioactive decay chain (see [[Radiometric dating]]). |alt=Diagram with compound balls representing nuclei and arrows.]]
[[Radioactive decay]] accounts for about {{math|80%}} of the Earth's [[internal heat]], powering the geodynamo and plate tectonics.&lt;ref name=Turcotte&gt;{{harvnb|Turcotte|Schubert|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main heat-producing [[isotopes]] are [[Potassium|potassium-40]], [[Uranium|uranium-238]], uranium-235, and [[Thorium|thorium-232]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sanders|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Radioactive elements are used for [[radiometric dating]], the primary method for establishing an absolute time scale in [[geochronology]].

Unstable isotopes decay at predictable rates, and the decay rates of different isotopes cover several orders of magnitude, so radioactive decay can be used to accurately date both recent events and events in past [[Era (geology)|geologic eras]].&lt;ref name=Renne&gt;{{harvnb|Renne|Ludwig|Karner|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiometric mapping using ground and airborne [[gamma spectrometry]] can be used to map the concentration and distribution of radioisotopes near the Earth's surface, which is useful for mapping lithology and alteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radiometrics|url=http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/disciplines/geophysics/radiometrics|website=Geoscience Australia|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interpreting radiometrics|url=http://spatial.agric.wa.gov.au/geophysics/radiometrics.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321102348/http://spatial.agric.wa.gov.au/geophysics/radiometrics.asp |archive-date=21 March 2012|website=Natural Resource Management|publisher=Department of Agriculture and Food, Government of Western Australia|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fluid dynamics ===
{{Main|Geophysical fluid dynamics}}
[[Fluid dynamics|Fluid motions]] occur in the magnetosphere, [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], ocean, mantle and core. Even the mantle, though it has an enormous [[viscosity]], flows like a fluid over long time intervals. This flow is reflected in phenomena such as [[isostasy]], [[post-glacial rebound]] and [[mantle plume]]s. The mantle flow drives plate tectonics and the flow in the Earth's core drives the geodynamo.&lt;ref name=Merrill/&gt;

Geophysical fluid dynamics is a primary tool in [[physical oceanography]] and [[meteorology]]. The rotation of the Earth has profound effects on the Earth's fluid dynamics, often due to the [[Coriolis effect]]. In the atmosphere it gives rise to large-scale patterns like [[Rossby waves]] and determines the basic circulation patterns of storms. In the ocean they drive large-scale circulation patterns as well as [[Kelvin waves]] and [[Ekman spirals]] at the ocean surface.&lt;ref name=Pedlosky&gt;{{harvnb|Pedlosky|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Earth's core, the circulation of the molten iron is structured by [[Taylor columns]].&lt;ref name=Merrill/&gt;

Waves and other phenomena in the magnetosphere can be modeled using [[magnetohydrodynamics]].

=== Mineral physics ===
{{further|Mineral physics}}
The physical properties of minerals must be understood to infer the composition of the Earth's interior from [[seismology]], the [[geothermal gradient]] and other sources of information. Mineral physicists study the [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] properties of minerals; their high-pressure [[phase diagrams]], melting points and [[equations of state]] at high pressure; and the [[Rheology|rheological properties]] of rocks, or their ability to flow. Deformation of rocks by [[creep (deformation)|creep]] make flow possible, although over short times the rocks are brittle. The [[viscosity]] of rocks is affected by temperature and pressure, and in turn determines the rates at which tectonic plates move.&lt;ref name=Poirier/&gt;

Water is a very complex substance and its unique properties are essential for life.&lt;ref name=Sadava&gt;{{harvnb|Sadava|Heller|Hillis|Berenbaum|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its physical properties shape the [[hydrosphere]] and are an essential part of the [[water cycle]] and [[climate]]. Its thermodynamic properties determine [[evaporation]] and the thermal gradient in the atmosphere. The many types of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] involve a complex mixture of processes such as [[coalescence (physics)|coalescence]], [[supercooling]] and [[supersaturation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sirvatka|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some precipitated water becomes [[groundwater]], and groundwater flow includes phenomena such as [[percolation]], while the [[conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]] of water makes electrical and electromagnetic methods useful for tracking groundwater flow. Physical properties of water such as [[salinity]] have a large effect on its motion in the oceans.&lt;ref name=Pedlosky/&gt;

The many phases of ice form the [[cryosphere]] and come in forms like [[ice sheet]]s, [[glacier]]s, [[sea ice]], freshwater ice, snow, and frozen ground (or [[permafrost]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CFG|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regions of the Earth ==

=== Size and form of the Earth ===
{{Main|Figure of the Earth}}
The Earth is roughly spherical, but it bulges towards the [[Equator]], so it is roughly in the shape of an ellipsoid (see [[Earth ellipsoid]]). This bulge is due to its rotation and is nearly consistent with an Earth in [[hydrostatic]] equilibrium. The detailed shape of the Earth, however, is also affected by the distribution of [[continents]] and [[ocean basins]], and to some extent by the dynamics of the plates.&lt;ref name=Lowrie/&gt;

=== Structure of the interior ===
{{Main|Structure of the Earth}}
[[Image:Earthquake wave paths.svg|thumb|260px|Seismic velocities and boundaries in the interior of the [[Earth]] sampled by seismic waves. |alt=Diagram with concentric shells and curved paths.]]
Evidence from seismology, heat flow at the surface, and [[mineral physics]] is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean [[specific gravity]] ({{math|5.515}}) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface ({{math|2.7–3.3}}), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low [[moment of inertia]] ({{math| 0.33 &lt;var&gt;M R&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, compared to {{math| 0.4 &lt;var&gt;M R&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the [[Adams–Williamson equation]]. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.&lt;ref name=Poirier/&gt;

Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no [[S-waves]] in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. The [[inner core]], however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.&lt;ref name=Lowrie&gt;{{harvnb|Lowrie|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and [[crust (geology)|crust]]. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and ''D′′'' layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the [[Mohorovičić discontinuity]].&lt;ref name=Lowrie/&gt;

The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the [[geotherm]] must also be determined. This requires physical theory for [[thermal conduction]] and [[convection]] and the heat contribution of [[radionuclides|radioactive elements]]. The main model for the radial structure of the interior of the Earth is the [[preliminary reference Earth model]] (PREM). Some parts of this model have been updated by recent findings in mineral physics (see [[post-perovskite]]) and supplemented by [[seismic tomography]]. The mantle is mainly composed of [[silicates]], and the boundaries between layers of the mantle are consistent with phase transitions.&lt;ref name=Poirier/&gt;

The mantle acts as a solid for seismic waves, but under high pressures and temperatures it deforms so that over millions of years it acts like a liquid. This makes [[plate tectonics]] possible.

=== Magnetosphere ===
{{Main|Magnetosphere}}
[[Image:Structure of the magnetosphere mod.svg|300px|thumb|Schematic of Earth's magnetosphere. The [[solar wind]] flows from left to right. |alt=Diagram with colored surfaces and lines.]]
If a planet's [[magnetic field]] is strong enough, its interaction with the solar wind forms a magnetosphere. Early [[space probe]]s mapped out the gross dimensions of the Earth's magnetic field, which extends about 10 [[Earth radii]] towards the Sun. The solar wind, a stream of charged particles, streams out and around the terrestrial magnetic field, and continues behind the [[Magnetotail|magnetic tail]], hundreds of Earth radii downstream. Inside the magnetosphere, there are relatively dense regions of solar wind particles called the Van Allen radiation belts.&lt;ref name=Kivelson/&gt;

== Methods ==

===Geodesy===
{{Main|Geodesy}}

Geophysical measurements are generally at a particular time and place. Accurate measurements of position, along with earth deformation and gravity, are the province of [[geodesy]]. While geodesy and geophysics are separate fields, the two are so closely connected that many scientific organizations such as the [[American Geophysical Union]], the [[Canadian Geophysical Union]] and the [[International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics]] encompass both.&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;{{harvnb|National Research Council (U.S.). Committee on Geodesy|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Absolute positions are most frequently determined using the [[global positioning system]] (GPS). A three-dimensional position is calculated using messages from four or more visible satellites and referred to the [[GRS 80|1980 Geodetic Reference System]]. An alternative, [[astro-geodetic|optical astronomy]], combines astronomical coordinates and the local gravity vector to get geodetic coordinates. This method only provides the position in two coordinates and is more difficult to use than GPS. However, it is useful for measuring motions of the Earth such as [[nutation]] and [[Chandler wobble]]. Relative positions of two or more points can be determined using [[very-long-baseline interferometry]].&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Defense Mapping Agency|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Torge&gt;{{harvnb|Torge|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravity measurements became part of geodesy because they were needed to related measurements at the surface of the Earth to the reference coordinate system. Gravity measurements on land can be made using [[gravimeters]] deployed either on the surface or in helicopter flyovers. Since the 1960s, the Earth's gravity field has been measured by analyzing the motion of satellites. Sea level can also be measured by satellites using [[Radar altimeter|radar altimetry]], contributing to a more accurate [[geoid]].&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt; In 2002, [[NASA]] launched the [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment]] (GRACE), wherein two twin satellites map variations in Earth's gravity field by making measurements of the distance between the two satellites using GPS and a microwave ranging system.  Gravity variations detected by GRACE include those caused by changes in ocean currents; runoff and ground water depletion; melting ice sheets and glaciers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CSR|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellites and space probes===
Satellites in space have made it possible to collect data from not only the visible light region, but in other areas of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. The planets can be characterized by their force fields: gravity and their magnetic fields, which are studied through geophysics and space physics.

Measuring the changes in acceleration experienced by spacecraft as they orbit has allowed fine details of the [[gravity field]]s of the planets to be mapped. For example, in the 1970s, the gravity field disturbances above [[lunar maria]] were measured through [[Lunar Orbiter program|lunar orbiters]], which led to the discovery of concentrations of mass, [[mass concentration (astronomy)|mascons]], beneath the [[Mare Imbrium|Imbrium]], [[Mare Serenitatis|Serenitatis]], [[Mare Crisium|Crisium]], [[Mare Nectaris|Nectaris]] and [[Mare Humorum|Humorum]] basins.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muller|Sjogren|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of geophysics}}
Geophysics emerged as a separate discipline only in the 19th century, from the intersection of [[physical geography]], [[geology]], [[astronomy]], meteorology, and physics.&lt;ref name=history_resources&gt;{{harvnb|Hardy|Goodman|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schröder|first=W.|title=History of geophysics|journal=Acta Geodaetica et Geophysica Hungarica|year=2010|volume=45|issue=2|pages=253–261|doi=10.1556/AGeod.45.2010.2.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many geophysical phenomena – such as the Earth's magnetic field and earthquakes – have been investigated since the [[Ancient history|ancient era]].

=== Ancient and classical eras ===
[[Image:EastHanSeismograph.JPG|thumbnail|upright|Replica of [[Zhang Heng]]'s seismoscope, possibly the first contribution to [[seismology]]. |alt=Picture of ornate urn-like device with spouts in the shape of dragons]]
The magnetic compass existed in China back as far as the fourth century BC. It was used as much for [[feng shui]] as for navigation on land. It was not until good steel needles could be forged that compasses were used for navigation at sea; before that, they could not retain their magnetism long enough to be useful. The first mention of a compass in Europe was in 1190 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Temple|2006|pp=162–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In circa 240 BC, [[Eratosthenes]] of Cyrene deduced that the Earth was round and measured the [[circumference of Earth|circumference of the Earth]], using trigonometry and the angle of the Sun at more than one latitude in Egypt. He developed a system of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]].&lt;ref name=Eratosthenes&gt;{{harvnb|Eratosthenes|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the earliest contribution to seismology was the invention of a [[seismoscope]] by the prolific inventor [[Zhang Heng]] in 132 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Temple|2006|pp=177–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; This instrument was designed to drop a bronze ball from the mouth of a dragon into the mouth of a toad. By looking at which of eight toads had the ball, one could determine the direction of the earthquake. It was 1571 years before the first design for a seismoscope was published in Europe, by [[Jean de Hautefeuille|Jean de la Hautefeuille]]. It was never built.&lt;ref name=Dewey&gt;{{harvnb|Dewey|Byerly|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beginnings of modern science ===
One of the publications that marked the beginning of modern science was [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]]'s ''[[De Magnete]]'' (1600), a report of a series of meticulous experiments in magnetism. Gilbert deduced that compasses point north because the Earth itself is magnetic.&lt;ref name=Merrill&gt;{{harvnb|Merrill|McElhinny|McFadden|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1687 Isaac Newton published his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', which not only laid the foundations for [[classical mechanics]] and [[gravitation]] but also explained a variety of geophysical phenomena such as the [[tides]] and the precession of the equinox.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newton|1999}} Section 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[seismometer]], an instrument capable of keeping a continuous record of seismic activity, was built by [[James David Forbes|James Forbes]] in 1844.&lt;ref name=Dewey/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2025">The '''gross reproduction rate''' ('''GRR''') is the average number of daughters a woman would have if she survived all of her childbearing years, which is roughly to the age of 45, subject to the age-specific fertility rate and sex ratio at birth throughout that period. This rate is a measure of replacement fertility if mortality is not in the equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/gross+reproduction+rate|title=gross reproduction rate|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often regarded as the extent to which the generation of daughters replaces the preceding generation of women and so on and so forth. If the value is equal to one that indicates that women will replace themselves. If the value is more than one that indicates that the next generation of women will outnumber the current one. If the value is less than one that indicates that the next generation of women will be less numerous than the current one.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Population: An introduction to Concepts and Issues|last=Weeks|first=John R.|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2014|isbn=978-1-305-09450-5|location=Boston, MA|pages=227-228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gross reproduction rate is similar to the [[net reproduction rate]] (NRR), the average number of daughters a woman would have if she survived her lifetime subject to the age-specific fertility rate and mortality rate throughout that period.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''History of Religions''''' (''HR'') is the first [[academic journal]] devoted to the study of comparative [[history of religions|religious history]]. The journal was founded in 1961 by [[Mircea Eliade]]. It is currently published by the [[University of Chicago Press]]. ''HR'' publishes articles that set the standard for the study of religious phenomena from prehistory to modern times, both within particular traditions and across cultural boundaries. In addition to major articles, the journal also publishes review articles and comprehensive book reviews. The journal also occasionally publishes special or theme issues. It is intended for historians of religion, anthropologists, comparative historians, and interdisciplinary scholars of religion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/journals/hr/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access==
The entire contents of the journal are available in full-text, searchable electronic databases. All issues except the most recent two years are available on [[JSTOR]]; more recent issues are available on the website of the publisher, University of Chicago Press.

==Abstracting and indexing==
''HR'' is abstracted and indexed in the [[Arts and Humanities Citation Index]], [[Bibliography of Asian Studies]], [[EBSCOhost]], [[Scopus]], and [[Web of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/journals/hr/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institut national de la recherche agronomique''' ('''INRA''', pronounced {{IPA-fr|inʁa|}}; English: National Institute of Agricultural Research) is a [[France|French]] public research institute dedicated to [[agricultural science]]. It was founded in 1946 and is a [[Public Scientific and Technical Research Establishment]] under the joint authority of the Ministries of Research and Agriculture.

INRA leads projects of targeted research for a sustainable agriculture, a safeguarded environment and a healthy and high quality food. Based on the number of publications in agricultural sciences/crops and animal sciences, INRA is the first institute for agricultural research in Europe, and the second in the world.&lt;ref name="inra-dam-front-resources-cdn.brainsonic.com"/&gt; It belongs to the top 1% most cited research institutes.&lt;ref name="inra-dam-front-resources-cdn.brainsonic.com"/&gt;

==Missions==
INRA main tasks are:
* to gather and disseminate knowledge;
* to build know-how and innovation for the society;
* to provide expertise to public institutions and private companies;
* to participate in science-society debates;
* to train in research.

==Staff and Organization==      
INRA is a research institute with 1,840 researchers, 1,756 research engineers and 4,694 lab workers/field workers/administrative staff.
In addition, 510 PhD students are trained, and 2,552 interns are employed every year.&lt;ref name="inra-dam-front-resources-cdn.brainsonic.com"/&gt;

INRA is composed of 13 scientific departments:
* Environment and Agronomy
* Biology and crop breeding
* Plant health and environment
* Ecology of forests, meadows and aquatic environments
* Animal genetics
* Animal physiology and animal production systems
* Animal health
* Characterization and processing of agricultural products
* Microbiology and food processing
* Human nutrition
* Sciences for action and development
* Social sciences, agriculture and food, territories and environment
* Applied mathematics and computer sciences

Moreover, INRA provides tools and support to the scientific community: databases, environmental research observatories, genetic resources centers, experimental platforms, etc.

==Centers and Partnerships==
In 2014, INRA has 17 regional centres in France, including in the French overseas territories. Most laboratories and facilities located in Paris region are to be moved to the [[Paris-Saclay]] [[research-intensive cluster]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epps.fr/en/a-global-cluster/a-world-class-university/&lt;/ref&gt;

INRA develops partnerships with:
* universities and French top schools in agricultural/veterinary sciences
* French research institutes of [[fundamental research|fundamental]] and [[targeted research|targeted]] research. Notably, [[CNRS]] and [[INSERM]] are INRA first two partners.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.natureindex.com/institution-outputs/France/French%20National%20Institute%20for%20Agricultural%20Research%20(INRA)/Life%20Sciences/Science&lt;/ref&gt;
* French research institutes of agricultural [[applied research]] ([[Terres Inovia]], [[Arvalis Institut du Végétal]], etc.)
* the main agricultural research institutes in the world ([[Rothamsted Research]], [[Wageningen University and Research Centre]], etc.). It has scientific collaborations and exchanges with many countries in Europe, America and Asia (see e.g. collaborations map in&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/institution/French_National_Institute_for_Agricultural_Research&lt;/ref&gt;). Nearly half of the publications are co-authored by foreign scientists.&lt;ref name="inra-dam-front-resources-cdn.brainsonic.com"/&gt;

==Research on wine and grapes==
INRA maintains a collection of vines at Domaine de Vassal, in [[Marseillan, Hérault|Marseillan]] near [[Sète]], a site where [[phylloxera]] cannot survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.montpellier.inra.fr/vassal/unite/presentation.html Domaine de Vassal at www1.montpellier.inra.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;[[Gouais blanc]] can be found there.

Researches on vine cultivation are conducted in Pech Rouge estate, in [[Gruissan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.montpellier.inra.fr/pechrouge/index.php/en/ Pech Rouge at www1.montpellier.inra.fr]&lt;/ref&gt; INRA also owns the [[Château Couhins]] wine-producing estate near Bordeaux. Many wine grapes have been created at INRA stations including [[Ederena]].&lt;ref name="Wine Grapes"&gt;J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz ''Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours'' pg 322, Allen Lane 2012 {{ISBN|978-1-846-14446-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

INRA was a member of the consortium for the genome sequencing of ''[[Vitis vinifera]]'' in 2007.

'''JUICE''' is a widely used{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} non-commercial [[software]] package for editing and analysing [[phytosociology|phytosociological]] data.

It was developed at the [[Masaryk University in Brno]], [[Czech Republic]] in 1998, and is fully described in English manual. It makes use of the previously-developed  [[TURBOVEG]]  software for entering and storing such data) and it offers a quite powerful tool for vegetation data analysis, including:
*creation of synoptic tables
*determination of diagnostic species according to their fidelity
*calculation of [[Indicator value|Ellenberg indicator values]] for relevés, various indices of [[Alpha diversity|alpha]] and [[beta diversity]]
*classification of relevés using TWINSPAN or [[Data clustering|cluster analysis]]
*expert system for vegetation classification based on [[COCKTAIL]] method etc.

The '''Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve''' is a 1,200 acre (5&amp;nbsp;km²) nature preserve and biological field station&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve Annual Report 2009-10 |publisher=Stanford University School of Humanities and Sciences |date=2010 |url=http://jrbp.stanford.edu/annualreport.php |accessdate=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; owned by [[Stanford University]], located at {{Coord|37.408|-122.2275|region:US-CA_type:landmark|display=inline,title}}&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|1786183|Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve}}&lt;/ref&gt; south of Sand Hill Road and west of [[Interstate 280 (California)|Interstate 280]] in [[Portola Valley, California]]. It is used by students, researchers, and docents to conduct biology research, and teach the community about the importance of that research. The preserve encompasses Jasper Ridge and [[Searsville Dam|Searsville Lake]] (actually a reservoir) and the upper reaches of [[San Francisquito Creek]], along with the latter's [[Corte Madera Creek (San Mateo County, California)|Corte Madera Creek]] and [[Bear Creek (San Francisquito Creek)|Bear Creek]] tributaries.

==Geology==
Jasper Ridge is part of the foothills northeast of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]] and is bounded by [[San Francisquito Creek]], [[Corte Madera Creek (San Mateo County, California)|Corte Madera Creek]] and [[Los Trancos Creek]], although the preserve occupies only the northwestern half of the ridge. The hilly mass runs about ten kilometers from northwest to southeast and about half that in width.&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;{{cite book |title=The broad-sclerophyll vegetation of California: an ecological study of the chaparral and its related communities |author=William Skinner Cooper |page=31 |year=1922 |publisher=The Carnegie Institution of Washington |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6RwoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=%22jasper+ridge%22+douglas+fir&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pgkli76nqx&amp;sig=CmwRwwbpG4mb0LMFIRy20PkcmkE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=09H-TdCKHZDEsAPK5oXeBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=jasper%20ridge&amp;f=false |accessdate=2011-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serpentine ([[Serpentinite]]) is the California State Rock. It was formed from deep sea or mantle rocks. This rock was squeezed toward the surface by tectonic plate movement, and thus feels greasy, as it has been polished over millions of years. Graywacke Sandstone after crossing Leonard's Bridge. This sandstone was part of the Franciscan formation 138 M years ago. Some rocks found at the preserve include: Greenstone, Chert, Serpentinite, Sandstone.

==Ecology==
In 1922, Cooper asserted that Jasper Ridge was historically chaparral, and cleared in the nineteenth century to open grasslands, primarily Eurasian wild oats ([[Avena fatua]] and [[Avena barbata]]).&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt; However much of the grassland has been replaced by various oaks, especially [[Coast Live Oak]] (''Quercus agrifolia''), and [[Pacific Madrone]] (''Arbutus menziesii''). More recently, the oak/madrone forest is being [[Ecological succession|succeeded]] by specimens of large [[Pseudotsuga menziesii|Douglas fir]] (''Pseudotsuga menziesii'') as in the image above. In addition there are several groves of second growth [[Coast Redwood]]s (''Sequoia sempervirens'') in the preserve, some in large "fairy rings" indicating that trees of immense girth were cut down in the nineteenth century.

==Academic studies==
Numerous academic studies and ecological experiments are conducted at Jasper Ridge.

===Global change experiment===
The Global Change Experiment studies the response of California annual grassland to global change, including elevated atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, temperature, altered precipitation, and increased nitrogen deposition.

===Argentine ant invasion===
This project studies and tracks the [[Argentine ant]]s, an invasive species.

===Bat monitoring===
A station near the lake monitors bats at night, by converting and recording bat sounds (ultrasonic echolocation).

'''Leaving the nest''' or '''moving out''' refers to the notion of a young person moving out of the accommodation provided by their guardian, [[fosterer]]s or [[parent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Apter|first1=Terry|title=The Myth of Maturity: What Teenagers Need from Parents to Become Adults|date=2002|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a move can be motivated by various factors, including a desire for independence, the discovery of a more viable location and/or practicality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peace|first1=Sheila|title=Adult Lives: A Life Course Perspective|date=2011|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The age at which young people move out of their previous accommodation has been rising since the turn of the [[21st century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2014/article/independence-for-young-millennials-moving-out-and-boomeranging-back.htm|title=Independence for young millennials: moving out and boomeranging back : Monthly Labor Review: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|last=R.|first=Dey,Judith G.;Pierret,Charles|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cultures view leaving the nest as one of the key milestones in the transition from tweenhood or teenhood to becoming an adult besides obtaining employment and getting wedded.&lt;ref&gt;Furstenberg, Frank F., Ruben G.

In some cultures, especially [[Middle Eastern]] ones, it is not as socially acceptable for a woman or girl to leave the home to live by herself without a marriage arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnett|first1=Jeffrey|title=International encyclopedia of adolescence: A-J, index, Volume 1|date=2007|page=1038}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have suggested that a delay in leaving the nest may result in a decrease in [[sexual activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/science/new-research-suggests-young-people-are-going-off-sex-1.2742803|title=New research suggests young people are going off sex|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7261">In [[theoretical computer science]], a '''Markov algorithm''' is a [[string rewriting system]] that uses [[Formal grammar|grammar]]-like rules to operate on [[string (computer science)|strings]] of symbols. Markov algorithms have been shown to be [[Turing-complete]], which means that they are suitable as a general model of [[computation]] and can represent any [[mathematical expression]] from its simple notation. Markov algorithms are named after the Soviet mathematician [[Andrey Markov, Jr.]]

[[Refal]] is a [[programming language]] based on Markov algorithms.

==Description==

Normal algorithms are verbal, that is intended to be applied to words in different alphabets.

Definition of any normal algorithm consists of two parts: the definition of the ''alphabet'' algorithm (the algorithm will be applied to words of these alphabet symbols), and the definition of its ''scheme''. Scheme normal algorithm is a finite ordered set of so-called ''substitution formulas'', each of which can be ''simple'' or ''final''. A simple formula substitutions are called words such as &lt;math&gt;L\to D&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; – are two arbitrary words in the alphabet of the algorithm (called, respectively, the left and right side of the formula substitution). Similarly, the final substitution formulas are called words of the form &lt;math&gt;L\to\cdot D&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; – are two arbitrary words in the alphabet of the algorithm. This assumes that the auxiliary characters &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\to\cdot&lt;/math&gt; do not belong to the alphabet of the algorithm (otherwise an executable their role divider left and right sides should select the other two letters).

An example of a normal algorithm scheme in five-letter alphabet &lt;math&gt;|*abc&lt;/math&gt; can serve the following scheme:

: &lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{matrix} |b&amp;\to&amp; ba|\\ ab&amp;\to&amp; ba\\ b&amp;\to&amp;\\ {*}|&amp;\to&amp; b*&amp; \\ {*}&amp;\to&amp; c&amp; \\
|c&amp;\to&amp; c\\ ac&amp;\to&amp; c|\\ c&amp;\to\cdot\end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

The process of applying the normal algorithm to an arbitrary word &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; in the alphabet of this algorithm is a discrete sequence of elementary steps, consisting of the following. Let’s assume that &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt; is the word obtained in the previous step of the algorithm (or the original word &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, if the current step is the first). If among formulas of substitution there is no left-hand side of which would be included in the &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt;, then the work of the algorithm is considered completed, and the result of this work is considered to be the word &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt;. Otherwise, including the substitution of the left side of which is included in the &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt;, the very first part is selected. If the substitution formula looks like &lt;math&gt;L\to\cdot D&lt;/math&gt;, then out of all of possible representations of the word &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt; that looks like &lt;math&gt;RLS&lt;/math&gt; it is chosen one &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, which is the shortest. Then the work of the algorithm is considered completed with the result &lt;math&gt;RDS&lt;/math&gt;. However, if this substitution formula looks like &lt;math&gt;L\to D&lt;/math&gt;, then out of all of possible representations of the word &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt; in the form of &lt;math&gt;RLS&lt;/math&gt; it is chosen one, in which &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; – the shortest, after which the word &lt;math&gt;RDS&lt;/math&gt; is considered to be the result of the current step, subject to further processing in the next step.

For example, during the process of applying the algorithm to the scheme diagram above the word &lt;math&gt;|*||&lt;/math&gt; consistently emerging the words &lt;math&gt;|b*|&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;ba|*|&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a|*|&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a|b*&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;aba|*&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;baa|*&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;aa|*&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;aa|c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;aac&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;ac|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c||&lt;/math&gt;, after which the algorithm stops with the result &lt;math&gt;.||&lt;/math&gt;    

For other examples, see below.

Any normal algorithm is equivalent to some [[Turing machine]], and vice versa{{snd}}any [[Turing machine]] is equivalent to some normal algorithm. A version of the [[Church-Turing thesis]] formulated in relation to the normal algorithm is called the "principle of normalization."

Normal algorithms have proved to be a convenient means for the construction of many sections of [[constructive mathematics]]. Moreover, inherent in the definition of a normal algorithm used in a number of ideas aimed at handling symbolic information programming languages{{snd}}for example, in [[Refal]].

==Algorithm==

The ''Rules'' is a sequence of pair of strings, usually presented in the form of ''pattern'' → ''replacement''. Each rule may be either ordinary or terminating.

Given an ''input'' string: 

#Check the Rules in order from top to bottom to see whether any of the ''patterns'' can be found in the ''input'' string.
#If none is found, the algorithm stops.
#If one (or more) is found, use '''the first''' of them to replace the leftmost occurrence of matched text in the ''input'' string with its ''replacement''.
#If the rule just applied was a terminating one, the algorithm stops.
#Go to step 1.

Note that after each rule application the search starts over from the first rule.

==Example==
The following example shows the basic operation of a Markov algorithm.

===Rules===
#"A" -&gt; "apple"
#"B" -&gt; "bag"
#"S" -&gt; "shop"
#"T" -&gt; "the"
#"the shop" -&gt; "my brother"
#"a never used" -&gt; '''.'''"terminating rule"

===Symbol string===
"I bought a B of As from T S."

===Execution===
If the algorithm is applied to the above example, the Symbol string will change in the following manner.

#"I bought a B of apples from T S."
#"I bought a bag of apples from T S."
#"I bought a bag of apples from T shop."
#"I bought a bag of apples from the shop."
#"I bought a bag of apples from my brother."

The algorithm will then terminate.

==Another Example==

These rules give a more interesting example. They rewrite binary numbers to their unary counterparts. For example: 101 will be rewritten to a string of 5 consecutive bars.

===Rules===
#"|0" -&gt; "0||"
#"1" -&gt; "0|"
#"0" -&gt; ""

===Symbol string===
"101"

===Execution===
If the algorithm is applied to the above example, it will terminate after the following steps.

#"101"
#"0|01"
#"00||1"
#"00||0|"
#"00|0|||"
#"000|||||"
#"00|||||"
#"0|||||"
#"|||||"

'''Sir Martin Wyatt Holdgate''' [[Companion of the Bath|CB]] (born 14 January 1931 in [[Horsham]], [[England]]) is an English [[biologist]] and environmental scientist.

==Early life==
Holdgate was born in Horsham, England on 14 January 1931, grew up in [[Blackpool]],&lt;ref name="FLD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fld.org.uk/sir-martin-holdgate-new-president-of-friends-of-the-lake-district.html|title=Sir Martin Holdgate – New President of Friends of the Lake District|date=22 July 2014|publisher=Friends of the Lake District|accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was educated at [[Arnold School]]. He then attended [[Cambridge University]] as an undergraduate at [[Queens' College|Queens' College, Cambridge]] from 1949, graduating in 1952 with degrees in [[zoology]] and [[botany]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quns.cam.ac.uk/queens/misc/Eminent.html Eminent Alumni] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616042915/http://www.quns.cam.ac.uk/Queens/Misc/Eminent.html |date=16 June 2009 }}, Queens's College, Cambridge, accessed 16 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and, subsequently, a doctorate in insect physiology.&lt;ref name="FLD" /&gt;

'''Mold health issues''' are potentially harmful effects of [[mold]]s.

Molds (US usage; British English "moulds") are ubiquitous in the biosphere, and mold [[spores]] are a common component of household and workplace dust. The United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] reported in its June 2006 report, 'Mold Prevention Strategies and Possible Health Effects in the Aftermath of Hurricanes and Major Floods,' that "excessive exposure to mold-contaminated materials can cause adverse health effects in susceptible persons regardless of the type of mold or the extent of contamination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weinhold B |title=A spreading concern: inhalational health effects of mold |journal=Environ. Health Perspect. |volume=115 |issue=6 |pages=A300–5 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17589582 |pmc=1892134 |doi=10.1289/ehp.115-a300}}&lt;/ref&gt; When mold spores are present in abnormally high quantities, they can present especially hazardous health risks to humans after prolonged exposure, including allergic reactions or poisoning by [[mycotoxin]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/indoorenv/mold.html Indoor Environmental Quality: Dampness and Mold in Buildings]. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. August 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; or causing fungal infection ([[mycosis]]).

==Health effects==

Studies have shown that people who are [[atopic]] (sensitive), already suffer from [[allergies]], [[asthma]], or compromised [[immune system]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stöppler|first=Melissa Conrad|title=Mold Exposure|website=medicinenet.com|date=July 16, 2014|accessdate=February 1, 2015|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/mold_exposure/page2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occupy damp or moldy buildings are at an increased risk of health problems such as inflammatory and toxic responses to mold spores, metabolites and other components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Elisabeth |last1=Heseltine |first2=Jerome |last2=Rosen, ed.|title=WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: dampness and mould|year= 2009 |page=93| ISBN= 978 92 890 4168 3 |url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/43325/E92645.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common health problem is an allergic reaction. Other problems are respiratory and/or immune system responses including respiratory symptoms, respiratory infections, exacerbation of asthma, and rarely [[hypersensitivity pneumonitis]], allergic alveolitis, chronic rhinosinusitis and allergic fungal sinusitis. Severe reactions are rare but possible. A person's reaction to mold depends on their sensitivity and other health conditions, the amount of mold present, length of exposure and the type of mold or mold products.

Some molds also produce [[mycotoxins]] that can pose serious health risks to humans and animals. The term "toxic mold" refers to molds that produce mycotoxins, such as ''[[Stachybotrys chartarum]]'', not to all molds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/indoorenv/mold.html Indoor Environmental Quality Dampness and Mold in Buildings]. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. August 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Exposure to high levels of mycotoxins can lead to neurological problems and in some cases death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 19854819| year = 2009| author1 = Empting| first1 = L. D.| title = Neurologic and neuropsychiatric syndrome features of mold and mycotoxin exposure| journal = Toxicology and Industrial Health| volume = 25| issue = 9–10| pages = 577–81| doi = 10.1177/0748233709348393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prolonged exposure, e.g., daily workplace exposure, can be particularly harmful.

The five most common genera of indoor molds are ''[[Cladosporium]]'', ''[[Penicillium]]'', ''[[Aspergillus]]'', ''[[Alternaria]]'' and ''[[Trichoderma]]''.

Damp environments which allow mold to grow can also produce bacteria and help release [[volatile organic compounds]].

===Symptoms of mold exposure===
Symptoms of mold exposure can include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Minnesota Department of Health|title=Mold and Moisture in Homes|url=http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/indoorair/mold/|publisher=Minnesota North Star|accessdate=November 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Nasal and sinus congestion, runny nose
*Respiratory problems, such as wheezing and difficulty breathing, chest tightness
*Cough
*Throat irritation
*Sneezing / Sneezing fits

==== Health effects linking to asthma ====
Infants may develop respiratory symptoms as a result of exposure to a specific type of fungal mold, called Penicillium. Signs that an infant may have mold-related respiratory problems include (but are not limited to) a persistent cough and/or wheeze. Increased exposure increases the probability of developing respiratory symptoms during their first year of life.  Studies have shown that a correlation exists between the probability of developing asthma and increased exposure to ''Penicillium''. The levels are deemed ‘no mold’  to ‘low level’, from ‘low’  to ‘intermediate’, and from ‘intermediate’  to ‘high’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gent|first=Janneane|title=Levels of Household Mold Associated with Respiratory Symptoms in the First Year of Life in a Cohort at Risk for Asthma|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1241132/pdf/ehp0110-a00781.pdf|journal= Environ Health Perspect|accessdate=November 18, 2011|pmc=1241132|pmid=12460818|volume=110|pages=A781-6|doi=10.1289/ehp.021100781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mold exposures have a variety of health effects depending on the person. Some people are more sensitive to mold than others. Exposure to mold can cause a number of health issues such as; throat irritation, nasal stuffiness, eye irritation, cough and wheezing, as well as skin irritation in some cases.  Exposure to mold may also cause heightened sensitivity depending on the time and nature of exposure.  People at higher risk for mold allergies are people with chronic lung illnesses, which will result in more severe reactions when exposed to mold.

There has been sufficient evidence that damp indoor environments are correlated with upper respiratory tract symptoms such as coughing, and wheezing in people with asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Aaron|title=WHO Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality: Dampness and Mould|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/43325/E92645.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flood specific mold health effects===
Among children and adolescents, the most common health effect post-flooding was lower respiratory tract symptoms though there was a lack of association with measurements of total fungi.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rabito|first=Felicia A.|last2=Iqbal|first2=Shahed|last3=Kiernan|first3=Michael P.|last4=Holt|first4=Elizabeth|last5=Chew|first5=Ginger L.|title=Children's respiratory health and mold levels in New Orleans after Katrina: A preliminary look|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0091674907022609|journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|volume=121|issue=3|pages=622–625|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2007.11.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that these respiratory symptoms were positively associated with exposure to water damaged homes, exposure included being inside without participating in clean up.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Despite lower respiratory effects among all children, there was a significant difference in health outcomes between children with pre-existing conditions and children without.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Children with pre-existing conditions were at greater risk that can likely be attributed to the greater disruption of care in the face of flooding and natural disaster.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Health effects in children and adolescents with chronic risk were also found to be at an increased risk of adverse outcomes following a natural disaster including diabetes, asthma, chronic lung disease, allergies, HIV/AIDS, other immune disease, heart defects, cystic fibrosis, depression, seizure disorders, Sickle Cell disease, kidney failure, and liver failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rath|first=Barbara|last2=Donato|first2=Jessica|last3=Duggan|first3=Alyson|last4=Perrin|first4=Keith|last5=Bronfin|first5=Daniel R.|last6=Ratard|first6=Raoult|last7=VanDyke|first7=Russell|last8=Magnus|first8=Manya|date=2007-05-01|title=Adverse Health Outcomes after Hurricane Katrina among Children and Adolescents with Chronic Conditions|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/214414|journal=Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved|volume=18|issue=2|pages=405–417|doi=10.1353/hpu.2007.0043|issn=1548-6869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although mold is the primary focus post flooding for residents, the effects of dampness alone must also be considered. According to the Institute of Medicine, there is a significant association between dampness in the home and wheeze, cough, and upper respiratory symptoms.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendell|first=Mark J.|last2=Mirer|first2=Anna G.|last3=Cheung|first3=Kerry|last4=Tong|first4=My|last5=Douwes|first5=Jeroen|title=Respiratory and Allergic Health Effects of Dampness, Mold, and Dampness-Related Agents: A Review of the Epidemiologic Evidence|url=http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1002410|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|language=en-US|volume=119|issue=6|pages=748–756|doi=10.1289/ehp.1002410}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later analysis determined that 30% to 50% of asthma-related health outcomes are associated with not only mold, but also dampness in buildings.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Another health effect associated with dampness and mold is Sick Building Syndrome (SBS), which is defined by manifestations of symptomatic illness as a result of poor indoor air quality and pollutant exposures .&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Signs of potentially illness-causing buildings include condensation on the windows, high humidity in the bathrooms, a moldy odor, or water leakage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anyanwu|first=Ebere C.|last2=Campbell|first2=Andrew W.|last3=Vojdani|first3=Aristo|title=Neurophysiological Effects of Chronic Indoor Environmental Toxic Mold Exposure on Children|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1100/tsw.2003.22|journal=The Scientific World Journal|language=en|volume=3|pages=281–290|doi=10.1100/tsw.2003.22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is a proven correlation between mold exposure and the development of upper and lower respiratory syndromes, there are still fewer incidences of negative health effect than one might expect.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barbeau|first=Deborah N.|last2=Grimsley|first2=L. Faye|last3=White|first3=LuAnn E.|last4=El-Dahr|first4=Jane M.|last5=Lichtveld|first5=Maureen|date=2010-03-01|title=Mold Exposure and Health Effects Following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103643|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|volume=31|issue=1|pages=165–178|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103643|issn=0163-7525}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Barbeau and colleagues suggested that studies do not show a greater impact from mold exposure for a number of reasons: 1) the types of health effects are not severe and are therefore not caught; 2) people whose homes have flooded find alternative housing to prevent exposure; 3) self-selection, the healthier people participated in mold clean-up and were less likely to get sick; 4) exposures were time-limited as result of remediation efforts and; 5) the lack of access to health care post-flooding may result in fewer illnesses being discovered and reported for their association with mold.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are also certain notable scientific limitations in studying the exposure effects of molds on individuals because there are currently no known biomarkers that can prove that a person has been exposed to molds.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molds, Toxic Molds, and Indoor Air Quality|last=Davis|first=Pamela|publisher=California State Library|year=2001|isbn=1-58703-133-7|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is currently impossible to prove correlation between mold exposure and symptoms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Fungal infection===
{{Further|Mycosis}}
A serious health threat from mold exposure for immunocompromised individuals is systemic fungal infection (systemic [[mycosis]]).

===Mold-induced hypersensitivity===
The most common form of [[hypersensitivity]] is caused by the direct exposure to inhaled mold spores that can be dead or alive or [[hypha]]l fragments which can lead to [[allergic asthma]] or [[allergic rhinitis]].&lt;ref name="Indian"&gt;Indian Health Service: Bemidji Area Office of Environmental Health and Engineering Environmental Health Services Section “Guideline on the Assessment and Remediation of Fungi in Indoor Environments”&lt;/ref&gt;  The most common effects are [[rhinorrhea]] (runny nose), watery eyes, coughing and [[asthma|asthma attacks]].  Another form of hypersensitivity is [[hypersensitivity pneumonitis]].  Exposure can occur at home, at work or in other settings.&lt;ref name="Indian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/hp/hp_summary.html |title=What Is Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis? |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |date=October 1, 2010 |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is predicted that about 5% of people have some airway symptoms due to allergic reactions to molds in their lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pmid = 12762072| year = 2003| last1 = Hardin | first1 = B.

Hypersensitivity may also be a reaction toward an established fungal infection in [[allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis]].

===Mycotoxin toxicity===
{{Main|Mycotoxin}}
Molds excrete toxic compounds called [[mycotoxin]]s, secondary metabolites produced by fungi under certain environmental conditions. These environmental conditions affect the production of mycotoxins at the transcription level. Temperature, water activity and pH, strongly influence mycotoxin biosynthesis by increasing the level of transcription within the fungal spore. It has also been found that low levels of fungicides can boost mycotoxin synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reverberi M, Ricelli A, Zjalic S, Fabbri AA, Fanelli C |title=Natural functions of mycotoxins and control of their biosynthesis in fungi |journal=Appl.

Extreme exposure to very high levels of mycotoxins can lead to neurological problems and in some cases death; fortunately, such exposures rarely to never occur in normal exposure scenarios, even in residences with serious mold problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Prolonged exposure, such as daily workplace exposure, can be particularly harmful.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The health hazards produced by mold have been associated with [[sick building syndrome]], but no validated studies have been able to demonstrate that normal indoor exposures to these common organisms pose a significant threat.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

It is thought{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} that all molds may produce [[mycotoxins]] and thus all molds may be potentially toxic if large enough quantities are ingested, or the human becomes exposed to extreme quantities of mold. Mycotoxins are not produced all the time, but only under specific growing conditions. Mycotoxins are harmful or lethal to humans and animals only when exposure is high enough, [[The dose makes the poison|as with absolutely all other substances]].

Mycotoxins can be found on the mold spore and mold fragments, and therefore they can also be found on the substrate upon which the mold grows.  Routes of entry for these insults can include ingestion, dermal exposure and inhalation.

Some mycotoxins cause immune system responses that vary considerably, depending on the individual. The duration of exposure, the frequency of exposure and the concentration of the insult (exposure) are elements in triggering immune system response.

[[Aflatoxin]] is an example of a mycotoxin. It is a cancer-causing poison produced by certain fungi in or on foods and feeds, especially in field corn and peanuts.&lt;ref name=fsis&gt;[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/molds-on-food-are-they-dangerous_/ United States Food Safety and Inspection Service &gt; Molds On Food: Are They Dangerous?] Last Modified: August 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, [[Toxicity|toxic effects]] from mold were thought to be the result of exposure to the [[mycotoxin]]s of some mold species, such as ''[[Stachybotrys chartarum]]''.  However, studies are suggesting that the so-called toxic effects are actually the result of chronic activation of the immune system, leading to chronic inflammation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Studies indicate that up to 25% of the population have the genetic capability of experiencing chronic inflammation to mold exposure, but it is unknown how many actually experience such symptoms due to frequent misdiagnosis.  A 1993–94 [[case study]] based on cases of [[pulmonary hemorrhage]] in infants in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] originally concluded there was [[Causality|causal relationship]] between the exposure and the disease.  The investigators revisited the cases and established that there was no link to the exposure to ''S. chartrum'' and the infants in their homes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The common house mold, ''[[Trichoderma longibrachiatum]]'', produces small toxic peptides containing amino acids not found in common proteins, like alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, called trilongins (up to 10% w/w). Their toxicity is due to absorption into cells and production of nano-channels that obstruct vital [[ion channels]] that ferry potassium and sodium ions across the [[cell membrane]]. This affects in the cells [[action potential]] profile, as seen in [[cardiomyocytes]], [[pneumocytes]] and [[neurons]] leading to conduction defects. Trilongins are highly resistant to heat and [[antimicrobials]] making [[primary prevention]] the only management option.&lt;ref&gt;Reason Discovered for the Toxicity of Indoor Mould – ScienceDaily (Oct. 12, 2012) : https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/10/121012074655.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;20-Residue and 11-residue peptaibols from the fungus Trichoderma longibrachiatum are synergistic in forming Na+/K+-permeable channels and adverse action towards mammalian cells      Raimo Mikkola1,†,     Maria A.

== Exposure sources and prevention ==
The main sources of mold exposure are from the indoor air in buildings with substantial mold growth, and from ingestion of food with mold growths.

===Air===
{{Main|Indoor air quality}}
Prevention of mold exposure and its ensuing health issues begins with prevention of mold growth in the first place by avoiding a mold-supporting environment such as humid air. Extensive flooding and water damage can support extensive mold growth. Following hurricanes, homes with greater flood damage, especially those with more than {{convert|3|ft|m}} of indoor flooding, demonstrated higher levels of mold growth compared with homes with little or no flooding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barbeau DN, Grimsley LF, White LE, [[Jane El-Dahr|El-Dahr JM]], Lichtveld M |title=Mold exposure and health effects following hurricanes Katrina and Rita |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |volume=31 |pages=165–78 |year=2010 |pmid=20070193 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103643 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103643?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shoemaker RC, House DE |title=Sick building syndrome (SBS) and exposure to water-damaged buildings: time series study, clinical trial and mechanisms |journal=Neurotoxicol Teratol |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=573–88 |year=2006 |pmid=17010568 |doi=10.1016/j.ntt.2006.07.003 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0892-0362(06)00085-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aftermath of a hurricane is the worst-case scenario, but the concept of water damage supporting widespread mold growth is more generally applicable.

It is useful to perform an assessment of the location and extent of the mold hazard in a structure. Various practices of remediation can be followed to mitigate mold issues in buildings, the most important of which is to reduce moisture levels.&lt;ref name="control"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kumar, Manisha |author2=Verma, Rajesh K |title=Fungi diversity, their effects on building materials, occupants and control– a brief review |journal=Journal of Scientific and industrial Research |volume=69 |issue=9 |pages=657–661 |date=September 2010 |url=http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/10103 |issn=0975-1084}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal of affected materials after the source of moisture has been reduced and/or eliminated may be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Wilson SC, Holder WH, Easterwood KV, etal |title=Identification, remediation, and monitoring processes used in a mold-contaminated high school |journal=Adv.

A common issue with mold hazards in the household is the placement of furniture, and the lack of ventilation which this causes to certain parts of the wall. The simplest method of avoiding mold in a home so affected is to move the furniture in question.

Adverse respiratory health effects are associated with occupancy in buildings with moisture and mold damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Krieger J, Jacobs DE, Ashley PJ, etal |title=Housing interventions and control of asthma-related indoor biologic agents: a review of the evidence |journal=J Public Health Manag Pract |volume=16 |issue=5 Suppl |pages=S11–20 |year=2010 |pmid=20689369 |doi=10.1097/PHH.0b013e3181ddcbd9 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1078-4659&amp;volume=16&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=S11|pmc=3934496 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molds may excrete liquids or low-volatility gases, but the concentrations are so low that frequently they cannot be detected even with sensitive analytical sampling techniques.  Sometimes these by-products are detectable by odor, in which case they are referred to as "ergonomic odors" meaning the odors are detectable, but do not indicate toxicologically significant exposures.

===Food===
[[File:Moldy nectarines.jpg|thumb|Moldy [[nectarine]]s that were in a refrigerator. The nectarine with black mold is also affecting the nectarine underneath.]]
Molds that are often found on meat and poultry include members of the genera ''[[Alternaria]]'', ''[[Aspergillus]]'', [[Botryotinia|''Botrytis'']], ''[[Cladosporium]]'', ''[[Fusarium]]'', ''[[Geotrichum]]'', ''[[Mortierella]]'', ''[[Mucor]]'', ''[[Neurospora]]'', ''[[Paecilomyces]]'', ''[[Penicillium]]'', and ''[[Rhizopus]]''.&lt;ref name=foodborne_fungi/&gt;  Grain crops in particular incur considerable losses both in field and storage due to pathogens, post-harvest spoilage, and insect damage.

Dietary exposure to the mycotoxin aflatoxin B1, commonly produced by growth of the fungus ''Aspergillus flavus'' on improperly stored ground nuts in many areas of the developing world, is known to independently (and synergistically with Hepatitis B virus) induce liver cancer.&lt;ref name=liu2010/&gt; Mycotoxin-contaminated grain and other food products have a significant impact on human and animal health globally. According to the World Health Organization, roughly 25% of the world's food may be contaminated by mycotoxins.&lt;ref name="Upadhaya" /&gt;

Prevention of mold exposure from food is generally to consume food that has no mold growths on it.&lt;ref name="fsis" /&gt; Also, mold growth in the first place can be prevented by the same concept of [[mold growth, assessment, and remediation]] that prevents air exposure. In addition, it is especially useful to clean the inside of the refrigerator, and to ensure dishcloths, towels, sponges and mops are clean.&lt;ref name="fsis" /&gt;

Ruminants are considered to have increased resistance to some mycotoxins, presumably due to the superior mycotoxin-degrading capabilities of their gut microbiota.&lt;ref name="Upadhaya" /&gt;  The passage of mycotoxins through the food chain may also have important consequences on human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Tanuma H, Hiramatsu M, Mukai H, etal |title=Case report.

=== Flooding ===
Flooding in houses causes a unique opportunity for mold growth which may be attributed to adverse health effects in people exposed to the mold, especially children and adolescents. In a study on the health effects of mold exposure after hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the predominant types of mold were ''[[Aspergillus]], [[Penicillium|Penicillum]]'', and ''[[Cladosporium]]'' with indoor spore counts ranging from 6,142 – 735,123 spores&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Molds isolated following flooding were different from mold previously reported for non-water damaged homes in the area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Further research found that homes with greater than three feet of indoor flooding demonstrated significantly higher levels of mold than those with little or no flooding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Recommended strategies to prevent mold include: avoiding mold-contamination; utilization of environmental controls; the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) including skin and eye protection and respiratory protection; and environmental controls such as ventilation and suppression of dust.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandt|first=Mary|last2=Brown|first2=Clive|last3=Burkhart|first3=Joe|last4=Burton|first4=Nancy|last5=Cox-Ganser|first5=Jean|last6=Damon|first6=Scott|last7=Falk|first7=Henry|last8=Fridkin|first8=Scott|last9=Garbe|first9=Paul|date=2006|title=Mold Prevention Strategies and Possible Health Effects in the Aftermath of Hurricanes and Major Floods|jstor=24842334|journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report: Recommendations and Reports|volume=55|issue=8|pages=1–CE–4|doi=10.2307/24842334}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When mold cannot be prevented, the CDC recommends clean-up protocol including first taking emergency action to stop water intrusion.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Second, they recommend determining the extent of water damage and mold contamination. And third, they recommend planning remediation activities such as establishing containment and protection for workers and occupants; eliminating water or moisture sources if possible; decontaminating or removing damaged materials and drying any wet materials; evaluating whether the space has been successfully remediated; and reassembling the space to control sources of moisture.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== History ==
In the 1930s, mold was identified as the cause behind the mysterious deaths of farm animals in Russia and other countries. ''[[Stachybotrys chartarum]]'' was found growing on wet grain used for animal feed.  Illness and death also occurred in humans when starving peasants ate large quantities of rotten food grains and cereals that were heavily overgrown with the ''Stachybotrys'' mold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=JD|last2=Rand|first2=TG|last3=Jarvis|first3=BB|title=Stachybotrys chartarum: cause of human disease or media darling?|journal=Medical mycology|date=August 2003|volume=41|issue=4|pages=271–91|doi=10.1080/1369378031000137350|pmid=12964721|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369378031000137350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, building [[construction]] techniques changed in response to changing economic realities including the [[energy crisis]]. As a result, homes and buildings became more airtight.  Also, cheaper materials such as [[drywall]] came into common use. The newer building materials reduced the drying potential of the structures making moisture problems more prevalent.  This combination of increased moisture and suitable substrates contributed to increased mold growth inside buildings.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Today, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|US Food and Drug Administration]] and the agriculture industry closely monitor mold and mycotoxin levels in grains and foodstuffs in order to keep the contamination of animal feed and human food supplies below specific levels. In 2005 [[Diamond Pet Foods]], a US pet food manufacturer, experienced a significant rise in the number of corn shipments containing elevated levels of [[aflatoxin]]. This mold toxin eventually made it into the pet food supply, and dozens of dogs and cats died before the company was forced to recall affected products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diamond Pet Food Recalled Due to Aflatoxin|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ArchiveRecalls/2005/ucm111929.htm|work=FDA.gov|accessdate=May 9, 2014|author=Mark Brinkman|date=December 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA Investigation of Diamond Pet Food Finds Some Product Exported|url=http://www.fda.gov/animalveterinary/newsevents/cvmupdates/ucm048391.htm|work=FDA.gov|accessdate=May 9, 2014|author=FDA, Center for Veterinary Medicine Communications Staff|date=December 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[U.S. International Trade Commission]] reported that according to one estimate, US insurers paid over $3 billion in mold-related lawsuits, more than double the previous year's total.&lt;ref name=rev&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A50nUiaQcuoC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=%22new+asbestos%22+mold&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d713AO8V8M&amp;sig=r2oaZpWciX3a7mAsb2XVqcE7WT4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=C55OVOfdGNDasATa0oCgBQ&amp;ved=0CJECEOgBMCU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22new%20asbestos%22%20mold&amp;f=false|title=Industry Trade and Technology Review|publisher=U.S. International Trade Commission|date= July 2005|ISBN= 1457819619|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Insurance Information Institute]], in 2003 there were over 10,000 mold-related lawsuits pending in US state courts.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;Jay Romano (January 26, 2003), [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/26/realestate/your-home-managing-mold-and-lawsuits.html "Your Home; Managing Mold, and Lawsuits"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Most were filed in states with high humidity, but suits were on the rise in other states as well.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; By 2004, many mold litigation settlements were for amounts well past $100,000.&lt;ref name=bianca&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/realestate/features/realestate2004/n_9985/|title=Spore War; New York has all the right conditions for a mold outbreak: middle-age buildings, lots of lawyers—and Bianca Jagger as toxic avenger.|author=Alex Williams|work=New York Magazine|accessdate=October 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, the U.S. International Trade Commission reported that toxic mold showed signs of being the "new [[Asbestos and the law|asbestos]]" in terms of claims paid.&lt;ref name=rev/&gt; In 2012, a key appellate court in Manhattan found a consensus in the scientific literature for a [[causal relationship]] between the presence of mold and resultant illness.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303816504577318040863277210|title=Mold Claims For Damages Get New Life|date=April 2, 2012 |author=  Josh Barbanel|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=October 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, an [[Austin, Texas]], woman was awarded $32 million when she sued her insurer over mold damage in her 22-room mansion.&lt;ref name=bianca/&gt;

In 2001, a jury awarded a couple and their eight-year-old son $2.7 million, plus attorney’s fees and costs, in a toxic mold-related [[personal injury]]  lawsuit against the owners and managers of their apartment in [[Sacramento, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/magazines/features/2001/11/26/18349.htm|title=Jury Awards $2.7M In Calif.

== Policy ==
While there is a national policy regarding mold, each state is responsible for independently creating and administering their own policy. For example, following Hurricane Harvey, the governor of Texas sought to expand the emergency response to allow mold remediation companies to come from out of state.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bouldercounty.org/disasters/flood/health/mold-remediation/|title=Mold Remediation After a Flood|work=Boulder County|access-date=2017-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nha Trang Oceanography Institute''' or '''Institute of Oceanography in Nhatrang''' is an [[oceanography]] institute located at 1 Cau Da St., next to Cau Da Wharf, about 6km from the centre of [[Nha Trang]], [[Khánh Hòa Province]], [[Vietnam]]. Established in 1923, it was one of the first centres for scientific research in Vietnam and is an important location for tropical oceanographic research.

The Marine Animal Museum is located in the vicinity which has more than 20,000 sea and freshwater creatures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14858">'''Nitrogen assimilation''' is the formation of organic nitrogen compounds like [[amino acid]]s from  inorganic nitrogen compounds present in the environment. Organisms like plants, fungi and certain bacteria that cannot [[nitrogen fixation|fix]] nitrogen gas (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) depend on the ability to assimilate [[nitrate]] or [[ammonia]] for their needs. Other organisms, like animals, depend entirely on organic nitrogen from their food.

==Nitrogen assimilation in plants==
Plants absorb nitrogen from the soil in the form of nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and ammonium (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).

Nitrate reduction is carried out in two steps.

===pH and Ionic balance during nitrogen assimilation===
[[File:Nitrate ion balance-variants.svg| thumb|upright=0.9 |Different plants use different pathways to different levels. Tomatoes take in a lot of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and accumulate salts in their vacuoles, castor reduces nitrate in the roots to a large extent and excretes the resulting alkali. Soy bean plants moves a large amount of malate to the roots where they convert it to alkali while the potassium is recirculated.]]
Every nitrate ion reduced to ammonia produces one OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion. To maintain a pH balance, the plant must either excrete it into the surrounding medium or neutralize it with organic acids. This results in the medium around the plants roots becoming alkaline when they take up nitrate.

To maintain ionic balance, every NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; taken into the root must be accompanied by either the uptake of a cation or the excretion of an anion. Plants like tomatoes take up metal ions like K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to exactly match every nitrate taken up and store these as the salts of organic acids like [[malate]] and [[oxalate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Plants that reduce nitrates in the shoots and excrete alkali from their roots need to transport the alkali in an inert form from the shoots to the roots. To achieve this they synthesize malic acid in the leaves from neutral precursors like carbohydrates. The potassium ions brought to the leaves along with the nitrate in the xylem are then sent along with the malate to the roots via the phloem. In the roots, the malate is consumed. When malate is converted back to malic acid prior to use, an OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is released and excreted. (RCOO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O -&gt; RCOOH +OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) The potassium ions are then recirculated up the xylem with fresh nitrate. Thus the plants avoid having to absorb and store excess salts and also transport the OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1104/pp.99.3.1118| issn = 0032-0889| volume = 99| issue = 3| pages = 1118–1123| last = Touraine| first = Bruno|author2=Bertrand Muller |author3=Claude Grignon | title = Effect of Phloem-Translocated Malate on NO3− Uptake by Roots of Intact Soybean Plants| journal = Plant Physiology| accessdate = 2013-02-19| date = 1992-07-01| url = http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/99/3/1118| pmc = 1080591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Normative''' generally means relating to an evaluative standard. Normativity is the phenomenon in human societies of designating some actions or outcomes as good or desirable or permissible and others as bad or undesirable or impermissible. A norm in this normative sense means a standard for evaluating or making judgments about behavior or outcomes. Normative is sometimes also used, somewhat confusingly, to mean relating to a descriptive standard: doing what is normally done or what most others are expected to do in practice. In this sense a norm is not evaluative, a basis for judging behavior or outcomes; it is simply a fact or observation about behavior or outcomes, without judgment. Many researchers in this field try to restrict the use of the term normative to the evaluative sense and refer to the description of behavior and outcomes as positive, descriptive, predictive, or empirical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Grammar of Society:The Nature and Dynamics of Social Norms|last=Bicchieri|first=Cristina|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0521574907|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Norms in the Wild: How to Diagnose, Measure, and Change Social Norms|last=Bicchieri|first=Cristina|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780190622053|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Normative'' has specialized meanings in different academic disciplines such as philosophy, social sciences, and law. In most contexts, normative means 'relating to an evaluation or value judgment.' Normative propositions tend to evaluate some object or some course of action. Normative content differs from descriptive content.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/227918828|title=Normativity|last=Jarvis.|first=Thomson, Judith|date=2008|publisher=Open Court|isbn=9780812696585|location=Chicago, Ill.|oclc=227918828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major developments in analytic philosophy has seen the reach of normativity spread to virtually all corners of the field, from ethics and the philosophy of action, to epistemology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of science. Saul Kripke famously showed that rules (including mathematical rules, such as the repetition of a decimal pattern) are normative in an important respect.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/862091562|title=Being realistic about reasons|last=Thomas,|first=Scanlon,|isbn=9780199678488|edition= First|location=Oxford|oclc=862091562}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7998796|title=Wittgenstein on rules and private language : an elementary exposition|last=1940-|first=Kripke, Saul A.,|date=1982|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674954009|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=7998796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though philosophers disagree about how normativity should be understood, it has become increasingly common to understand normative claims as claims about reasons.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As Derek Parfit explains:

{{Quote|We can have reasons to believe something, to do something, to have some desire or aim, and to have many other attitudes and emotions, such as fear, regret, and hope. Reasons are given by facts, such as the fact that someone's finger-prints are on some gun, or that calling an ambulance would save someone's life. It is hard to explain the ''concept'' of a reason, or what the phrase 'a reason' means. Facts give us reasons, we might say, when they count in favour of our having some attitude, or our acting in some way. But 'counts in favour of' means roughly 'gives a reason for'. The concept of a reason is best explained by example. One example is the thought that we always have a reason to want to avoid being in agony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/744616054|title=On what matters Volume one|last=Derek.|first=Parfit,|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Scheffler, Samuel, 1951-|isbn=9780191576706|location=Oxford|oclc=744616054}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Philosophy ==
{{main|Ethics}}
In [[philosophy]], ''normative'' statements make claims about how things should or [[Is-ought problem|ought]] to be, how to [[Value theory|value]] them, which things are [[goodness and value theory|good]] or bad, and which [[Action (philosophy)|action]]s are [[right]] or [[wrong]].  Normative claims are usually contrasted with [[Positive statement|positive]] (i.e. descriptive, [[explanation|explanatory]], or [[constative]]) claims when describing types of [[theory|theories]], [[belief]]s, or [[proposition]]s. Positive statements are (purportedly) factual statements that attempt to describe [[reality]].

For example, "children should eat vegetables", and "those who would sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither" are normative claims. On the other hand, "vegetables contain a relatively high proportion of vitamins", and "a common consequence of sacrificing liberty for security is a loss of both" are positive claims. Whether a statement is normative is logically independent of whether it is verified, verifiable, or popularly held.

There are several schools of thought regarding the status of normative statements and whether they can be [[reason|rationally]] discussed or defended. Among these schools are the tradition of [[practical reason]] extending from [[Aristotle]] through [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] to [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]], which asserts that they can, and the tradition of [[emotivism]], which maintains that they are merely expressions of emotions and have no cognitive content. &lt;!--last sentence/statement: i.e., objectivity vs. subjectivity(?)--&gt;

Normative statements and [[norm (philosophy)|norms]], as well as their meanings, are an integral part of human life. They are fundamental for prioritizing goals and organizing and planning. [[Thought]], [[belief]], [[emotion]], and [[Action (philosophy)|action]] are the basis of much ethical and political discourse; indeed, normativity is arguably the key feature distinguishing ethical and political discourse from other discourses (such as natural science).

Much modern moral/ethical philosophy takes as its starting point the apparent variance between peoples and cultures regarding the ways they define what is considered to be appropriate/desirable/praiseworthy/valuable/good etc. (In other words, variance in how individuals, groups and societies define what is in accordance with their normative standards.) This has led philosophers such as [[A.J. Ayer]] and [[J.L. Mackie]] (for different reasons and in different ways) to cast doubt on the meaningfulness of normative statements. However, other philosophers, such as [[Christine Korsgaard]], have argued for a source of normative value which is independent of individuals' subjective morality and which consequently attains (a lesser or greater degree of) objectivity.

== Social sciences and economics ==
In the [[social sciences]], the term "normative" has broadly the same meaning as its usage in philosophy, but may also relate, in a [[sociological]] context, to the role of cultural '[[norm (social)|norms]]'; the shared values or institutions that [[structural functionalist]]s regard as constitutive of the [[social structure]] and [[social cohesion]]. These values and units of [[socialization]] thus act to encourage or enforce social activity and outcomes that ''ought'' to (with respect to the [[norm (sociology)|norms]] implicit in those structures) occur, while discouraging or preventing social activity that ''ought not'' occur. That is, they promote social activity that is socially ''valued'' (see [[normative#Philosophy|philosophy]] above). While there are always anomalies in social activity (typically described as "[[crime]]" or anti-social behaviour, see also [[normality (behavior)]]) the normative effects of popularly endorsed beliefs (such as "[[family values]]" or "[[common sense]]") push most social activity towards a generally homogeneous set. From such reasoning, however, functionalism shares an affinity with ideological [[conservatism]].

[[Normative economics]] deals with questions of what sort of economic policies should be pursued, in order to achieve desired (that is, valued) economic outcomes.

== International relations ==
In the academic discipline of [[International relations]], Smith, Baylis &amp; Owens in the ''Introduction'' to their 2008 &lt;ref&gt;''The Globalization of World Politics: An introduction to international relations'', New York, Oxford University Press {{ISBN|9780199297771}}, Fourth edition, pp.2-13&lt;/ref&gt; book make the case that the normative position or normative theory is to make the world a better place and that this theoretical [[worldview]] aims to do so by being aware of [[Tacit assumption|implicit assumption]]s and [[explicit assumption]]s that constitute a non-normative position, and align or position the normative towards the [[:wikt:loci|loci]] of other key socio-political theories such as political [[Liberalism]], [[Marxism]], political [[Constructivism (international relations)|Constructivism]], political [[Realism (international relations)|Realism]], political [[Idealism]] and political [[Globalization]].

== Law ==
{{See also|Normative jurisprudence}}
In [[law]], as an academic discipline, the term "normative" is used to describe the way something ought to be done according to a value position. As such, normative arguments can be conflicting, insofar as different values can be inconsistent with one another. For example, from one normative value position the purpose of the criminal process may be to repress crime. From another value position, the purpose of the criminal justice system could be to protect individuals from the moral harm of wrongful conviction.

== Standards documents ==
Normative elements are defined in [[International Organization for Standardization]] Directives Part 2 as "elements that describe the scope of the document, and which set out provisions".  Provisions include "requirements", "recommendations" and "statements".  "Statements" include permissions, possibilities and capabilities.  A "requirement" is an "expression in the content of a document conveying criteria to be fulfilled if compliance with the document is to be claimed and from which no deviation is permitted."  It is not necessary to comply with recommendations and statements in order to comply with the standard; it is necessary to comply only with the requirements (that are denoted by the verbal form "shall").  There is much confusion between "normative" and "requirement", however the ISO terminology is supported by national standards bodies worldwide and is the legitimate description of these terms in the context of standards documents.

In [[Standardization|standard]]s terminology still used by some organisations, "normative" means "considered to be a [[wikt:prescriptive|prescriptive]] part of the standard". It characterises that part of the standard which describes what ''ought'' (see [[normative#Philosophy|philosophy]] above) to be done within the application of that standard. It is implicit that application of that standard will result in a ''valuable'' outcome (''ibid.''). For example, many standards have an introduction, preface, or summary that is considered non-normative, as well as a main body that is considered normative. "Compliance" is defined as "complies with the normative sections of the standard"; an object that complies with the normative sections but not the non-normative sections of a standard is still considered to be in compliance.

* Normative = prescriptive = how to comply
* Informative = descriptive = help with conceptual understanding

Typically, ''normative'' is contrasted with ''informative'' (referring to the standard's descriptive, explanatory or [[Positive science|positive]] content).  Informative data is supplemental information such as additional guidance, supplemental recommendations, tutorials, commentary as well as background, history, development, and relationship with other elements.  Informative data is not a requirement and doesn’t compel compliance.

'''Pavlok''' is a wearable device that uses [[operant conditioning]] through [[haptic feedback]] to modify behavior. Users are said to be able to break bad habits by pairing the behavior with up to 150 [[volts]] of "zaptic feedback", and can establish new routines by pairing the behavior with vibration.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://buy.pavlok.com/pages/frontpage|title=Pavlok: Frontpage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Pavlok is a Behavioral Technology Group product, created by [[Maneesh Sethi]], an author and television personality. Sethi was previously known for his writing as [[Editor-in-chief]] of ''Hack The System'', a series of articles and guides on establishing a [[passive income]] and being productive.

In 2012, Sethi was featured on [[Daily News (New York)|NY Daily News]], [[CNET]], [[Huffington Post]], and other news outlets for hiring a woman off of [[Craigslist]] to slap him across the face whenever he was distracted from his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/blogger-hires-woman-slap-procrastinates-article-1.1186931|title=Blogger hires woman to slap him when he procrastinates|last=Roberts|first=Christine|date=October 18, 2012|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/man-hires-woman-to-slap-him-every-time-hes-on-facebook/|title=Man hires woman to slap him every time he's on Facebook|newspaper=[[CNET]]|author=Matyszczyk, Chris|date=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/18/maneesh-sethi-blogger-hires-craigslist-slapper-to-hit-him-unproductive_n_1980274.html|title=Maneesh Sethi, San Francisco Blogger, Hires Craigslist Slapper To Hit Him For Productivity|author=Bennett-Smith, Meredith|date=October 18, 2012|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed with the observable effects of [[operant conditioning]], Sethi founded Behavioral Technology Group in July of the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://hackthesystem.com/blog/pavlok-revealed-wednesday-beta-test-the-first-habit-training-devices/|author=Sethi, Maneesh|title=Pavlok Revealed: Beta-test the first habit-training device|date=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardware==

Pavlok has two main hardware components: the wristband and the removable module.

===Wristband===
Pavlok's wristband is one size fits all, and is made with [[silicone]]. As of July 2015, Pavlok offers colored wristbands for separate purchase in blue, red, pink, and gray.

===Module===

The module is made to fit inside the wristband, and is constructed to prevent accidental disassembling. Inside of the module is a [[Bluetooth_Low_Energy| Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)]] unit and a [[rechargeable battery]]. Pavlok synchronizes data with the user's cellphone via [[Bluetooth_Low_Energy|BLE]]. The battery is specified to typically last around 3-6 days on a single charge and is charged via a [[micro USB|micro USB port]]. The zapping voltage is adjustable from 150 to 450 [[Volt]].&lt;ref&gt;Pavlok instructions https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810wmdhDgrS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==

Pavlok currently offers a private beta app for [[iOS]], acting as a remote control for the device via [[Bluetooth]]. The full app (still in development) includes a five-day audio course in [[Aversion therapy|aversion conditioning]], with custom sessions tailored specifically for [[smoking]], [[nail-biting]], and [[Binge eating|overeating]].

Pavlok is built with an [[open API]] in order to encourage users to synchronize their data with third-party health and [[fitness app]]s. Interaction with original and third-party applications is incorporated with Pavlok's unique [[payment system]], referred to as "Volts".

==Volts==
In 2014, Pavlok established its own [[digital currency]]. Users can earn Volts for their activity on the Pavlok application, such as completing an audio course or reaching a [[goal]]. Volts are an internet-based [[medium of exchange]], and can be redeemed for additional in-app courses and modules. Pavlok uses this [[payment system]] to leverage [[behavioral economics]] and improve its capacity to modify behavior, as financial incentives have been shown to enhance success in [[smoking cessation]], grade performance, and other endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1503200"|title=Nudging Smokers|author=Cass Sunstein|newspaper=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://rady.ucsd.edu/docs/faculty/Levitt_et_al_Behavioralist_School_NBER_WP18165.pdf|title=The Behavioralist Goes to School|author=Levitt, Steven D.|newspaper=NBER Working Paper Series|date=June 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shark Tank ==
In May 2016, Pavlok was featured on ABC's Shark Tank Season 7 Finale. Sethi asked the sharks for $500,000 for 3.14% equity, valuing Pavlok at nearly $16 million. Kevin O'Leary offered Maneesh $500,000 for 3.14% of Pavlok by way of a 2 year balloon loan at 7.5%. Maneesh Sethi, founder of Pavlok, declined the offer. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank/episode-guide/season-07/29-episode-29|title=Shark Tank: Episode 29 - Watch Season 7 Episode 29|website=ABC|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

Behavioral Technology Group is included on [[Entrepreneur Magazine|Entrepreneur Magazine's]] 2015 list of ''100 Brilliant Companies to Watch''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/245890|newspaper=Entrepreneur|title=100 Brilliant Companies to Watch|date=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, Pavlok was named a finalist in the [[MassChallenge]] accelerator program.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://masschallenge.org/startups/2015/profile/pavlok-wear-your-willpower|title=2015 Startup Profile: Pavlok}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radiosurgery''' is [[surgery]] using [[radiation]],&lt;ref name="Dorlands"&gt;{{Citation |author=Elsevier |authorlink=Elsevier |title=Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary |publisher=Elsevier |url=http://dorlands.com/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, the destruction of precisely selected areas of [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] using [[ionizing radiation]] rather than excision with a blade. Like other forms of [[radiation therapy]] (also called radiotherapy), it is usually used to treat [[cancer]]. Radiosurgery was originally defined by the Swedish neurosurgeon [[Lars Leksell]] as "a single high dose fraction of radiation, stereotactically directed to an intracranial region of interest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leksell|first=Lars|title=The stereotaxic method and radiosurgery of the brain|journal=Acta Chirurgica Scandinavica|date=December 1951 |volume=102|issue=4|pages=316–9|pmid=14914373}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In '''[[stereotactic surgery|stereotactic radiosurgery]]''' ('''SRS'''), the word "stereotactic" refers to a three-dimensional [[coordinate system]] that enables accurate correlation of a virtual target seen in the patient's diagnostic images with the actual target position in the patient.

When used outside the CNS it may be called stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR).&lt;ref name=SBRT/&gt;

Technological improvements in medical imaging and computing have led to increased clinical adoption of stereotactic radiosurgery and have broadened its scope in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=De Salles|first=A|title=Radiosurgery from the brain to the spine: 20 years experience|journal=Acta Neurochirurgica. Supplement |year=2008|volume=101|pages=163–168|pmid=18642653|doi=10.1007/978-3-211-78205-7_28|series=Acta Neurochirurgica Supplementum|isbn=978-3-211-78204-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Timmerman|first=Robert|title=Excessive toxicity when treating central tumors in a phase II study of stereotactic body radiation therapy for medically inoperable early-stage lung cancer|journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology|year=2006|volume=24|issue=30|pages=4833–9|doi=10.1200/JCO.2006.07.5937|pmid=17050868}}&lt;/ref&gt; The localization accuracy and precision that are implicit in the word "stereotactic" remain of utmost importance for radiosurgical interventions.  
In the 21st century the original concept of radiosurgery  expanded to include treatments comprising up to five fractions, and stereotactic radiosurgery has been redefined as a distinct neurosurgical discipline that utilizes externally generated ionizing radiation to inactivate or eradicate defined targets, typically in the head or spine, without the need for a surgical incision.&lt;ref name=barnett&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnett|first=Gene H.|title=Stereotactic radiosurgery-an organized neurosurgery-sanctioned definition|journal=Journal of Neurosurgery|year=2007|volume=106|issue=1|pages=1–5|doi=10.3171/jns.2007.106.1.1|pmid=17240553}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Irrespective of the similarities between the concepts of stereotactic radiosurgery and [[Dose fractionation|fractionated]] radiotherapy the intent of both approaches is fundamentally different, although both treatment modalities are reported to have identical outcomes for certain indications.&lt;ref name=combs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Combs|first=Stephanie|title=Differences in clinical results after LINAC-based single-dose radiosurgery versus fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for patients with vestibular schwannomas|journal=International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics|year=2010|volume=76|issue=1|pages=193–200|doi=10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.01.064|pmid=19604653}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of stereotactic radiosurgery is to destroy target tissue while preserving adjacent normal tissue, where fractionated radiotherapy relies on a different sensitivity of the target and the surrounding normal tissue to the [[Absorbed dose|total accumulated radiation dose]].&lt;ref name=barnett/&gt; Historically, the field of fractionated radiotherapy evolved from the original concept of stereotactic radiosurgery following discovery of the principles of [[radiobiology]]: repair, reassortment, repopulation, and reoxygenation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernier|first=Jacques|title=Radiation oncology: a century of achievements|journal=Nature Reviews. Cancer|year=2004|volume=4|issue=9|pages=737–747|doi=10.1038/nrc1451|pmid=15343280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, both treatment techniques are complementary, as tumors that may be resistant to fractionated radiotherapy may respond well to radiosurgery, and tumors that are too large or too close to critical organs for safe radiosurgery may be suitable candidates for fractionated radiotherapy.&lt;ref name=combs /&gt;

==History==
Stereotactic radiosurgery was first developed in 1949 by the Swedish neurosurgeon Lars Leksell to treat small targets in the brain that were not amenable to conventional surgery. The initial stereotactic instrument he conceived used probes and electrodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leksell|first=Lars|title=A stereotaxic apparatus for intracerebral surgery|journal=Acta Chirurgica Scandinavica|year=1949|volume=99|pages=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first attempt to supplant the electrodes with radiation was made in the early fifties, with [[x-ray]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leksell|first=Lars|title=The stereotaxic method and radiosurgery of the brain|journal=Acta Chirurgica Scandinavica|date=December 1951|volume=102|issue=4|pages=316–9|pmid=14914373}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of this instrument was to hit the intra-cranial target with narrow beams of radiation from multiple directions. The beam paths converge in the target volume, delivering a lethal cumulative dose of radiation there, while limiting the dose to the adjacent healthy tissue. Ten years later significant progress had been made, due in considerable measure to the contribution of the physicists Kurt Liden and Börje Larsson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsson|first=Borje|title=The high-energy proton beam as a neurosurgical tool|journal=Nature|year=1958|volume=182|issue=4644|pages=1222–3|pmid=13590280|doi=10.1038/1821222a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At this time, stereotactic [[proton]] beams had replaced the x-rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leksell|first=Lars|title=Lesions in the depth of the brain produced by a beam of high energy protons|journal=Acta Radiologica|date=October 1960|volume=54|issue=4|pages=251–64|pmid=13760648|doi=10.3109/00016926009172547}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy particle beam presented as an excellent replacement for the surgical knife, but the [[synchrocyclotron]] was too clumsy. Leksell proceeded to develop a practical, compact, precise and simple tool which could be handled by the surgeon himself. In 1968 this resulted in the Gamma Knife, which was installed at the [[Karolinska Institutet|Karolinska Institute]] and consisted of several [[cobalt-60]] [[radioactivity|radioactive]] sources placed in a kind of helmet with central channels for irradiation with gamma rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leksell|first=Lars|title=Stereotactic Radiosurgery|journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry|date=September 1983|volume=46|issue=9|pages=797–803|pmid=6352865|doi=10.1136/jnnp.46.9.797|pmc=1027560}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prototype was designed to produce slit-like radiation lesions for functional neurosurgical procedures to treat pain, movement disorders, or behavioral disorders that did not respond to conventional treatment. The success of this first unit led to the construction of a second device, containing 179 cobalt-60 sources. This second Gamma Knife unit was designed to produce spherical lesions to treat brain tumors and intracranial [[arteriovenous malformation]]s (AVMs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wu|first=Andrew|title=Physics of Gamma Knife approach on convergent beams in stereotactic radiosurgery|journal=International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics|date=April 1990|volume=18|issue=4|pages=941–949|doi=10.1016/0360-3016(90)90421-f}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s the third and fourth units (with 201 cobalt-60 sources) were installed in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Sheffield, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walton|first=L|title=The Sheffield stereotactic radiosurgery unit: physical characteristics and principles of operation|journal=British Journal of Radiology|year=1987|volume=60|issue=717|pages=897–906|doi=10.1259/0007-1285-60-717-897|pmid=3311273}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth Gamma Knife was installed at the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] in [[Pittsburgh]] in 1987.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In parallel to these developments, a similar approach was designed for a [[linear particle accelerator]] or Linac. Installation of the first 4&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|MeV]] clinical linear accelerator began in June 1952 in the Medical Research Council (MRC) Radiotherapeutic Research Unit at the [[Hammersmith Hospital]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fry|first=D.W.|title=A traveling wave linear accelerator for 4 MeV electrons|journal=Nature|year=1948|volume=162|pages=859–61|pmid=18103121|issue=4126|doi=10.1038/162859a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was handed over for physics and other testing in February 1953 and began to treat patients on 7 September that year. Meanwhile, work at the Stanford Microwave Laboratory led to the development of a 6-MV accelerator, which was installed at Stanford University Hospital, California, in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernier|first=J|title=Radiation oncology: a century of achievements|journal=Nature Reviews. Cancer|year=2004|volume=4|issue=9|pages=737–47|doi=10.1038/nrc1451|pmid=15343280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linac units quickly became favored devices for conventional fractionated [[radiation therapy|radiotherapy]] but it lasted until the 1980s before dedicated Linac radiosurgery became a reality. In 1982, the Spanish neurosurgeon J. Barcia-Salorio began to evaluate the role of cobalt-generated and then Linac-based photon radiosurgery for the treatment of AVMs and [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barcia-Salorio|first=J.L.|title=Radiosurgical treatment of carotid-cavernous fistula|journal=Applied Neurophysiology|year=1982|volume=45|issue=4–5|pages=520–522|doi=10.1159/000101675}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Betti and Derechinsky described a Linac-based radiosurgical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Betti|first=O.O.|title=Hyperselective encephalic irradiation with a linear accelerator|journal=Acta Neurochirurgica Supplement (Wien)|year=1984|volume=33|pages=385–390|doi=10.1007/978-3-7091-8726-5_60|isbn=978-3-211-81773-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winston and Lutz further advanced Linac-based radiosurgical prototype technologies by incorporating an improved stereotactic positioning device and a method to measure the accuracy of various components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winston|first=K.R.|title=Linear accelerator as a neurosurgical tool for stereotactic radiosurgery|journal=Neurosurgery|year=1988|volume=22|issue=3|pages=454–464|doi=10.1227/00006123-198803000-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a modified Linac, the first patient in the United States was treated in Boston [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] in February 1986.

Today, both Gamma Knife and Linac radiosurgery programs are commercially available worldwide. While the Gamma Knife is dedicated to radiosurgery, most Linacs are built for conventional fractionated radiotherapy and require additional technology and expertise to become dedicated radiosurgery tools. This is exemplified by the [http://www.novalistxradiosurgery.com Novalis Radiosurgery Program], designed to complement conventional Linacs with sophisticated beam-shaping technology, treatment planning,  and image-guidance tools to provide highest treatment accuracy. An example of a dedicated radiosurgery Linac is the [[CyberKnife]], a compact Linac mounted onto a robotic arm that moves around the patient and irradiates the tumor from a large set of fixed positions, thereby mimicking the Gamma Knife concept.

==Clinical applications==
When used outside the CNS it may be called stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR).&lt;ref name=SBRT&gt;[http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancers-in-general/treatment/radiotherapy/external/stereotactic-body-radiotherapy-sabr Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central nervous system===
Radiosurgery is performed by a multidisciplinary team of [[neurosurgeons]], [[radiation oncologist]]s and medical [[physicist]]s to operate and maintain highly sophisticated, highly precise and complex instruments, including medical linear accelerators, the Gamma Knife unit and the Cyberknife unit. The highly precise irradiation of targets within the brain and spine is planned using information from medical images that are obtained via [[computed tomography]], [[magnetic resonance imaging]], and [[angiography]].

Radiosurgery is indicated primarily for the therapy of tumors, vascular lesions and functional disorders.  Significant clinical judgment must be used with this technique and considerations must include lesion type, pathology if available, size, location and age and general health of the patient.  General contraindications to radiosurgery include excessively large size of the target lesion, or lesions too numerous for practical treatment. Patients can be treated within one to five days as [[outpatient]]s. By comparison, the average hospital stay for a [[craniotomy]] (conventional neurosurgery, requiring the opening of the skull) is about 15 days. The radiosurgery outcome may not be evident until months after the treatment. Since radiosurgery does not remove the tumor but inactivates it biologically, lack of growth of the lesion is normally considered to be treatment success. General indications for radiosurgery include many kinds of brain tumors, such as [[acoustic neuroma]]s, [[germinoma]]s, [[meningioma]]s, [[metastases]], trigeminal neuralgia, arteriovenous malformations, and skull base tumors, among others. Expansion of stereotactic radiotherapy to extracranial lesions is increasing, and includes metastases, liver cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, etc.

===Mechanism of action===
[[Image:Acoustic schwannoma gamma knife.jpg|right|thumb|Planning [[CT scan]] with IV contrast in a patient with left cerebellopontine angle [[vestibular schwannoma]]]]
The fundamental principle of radiosurgery is that of selective [[ionization]] of tissue, by means of high-energy beams of radiation. Ionization is the production of [[ion]]s and [[free radicals]] which are damaging to the [[cell (biology)|cells]]. These ions and radicals, which may be formed from the water in the cell or biological materials, can produce irreparable damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids, resulting in the cell's death. Thus, biological inactivation is carried out in a volume of tissue to be treated, with a precise destructive effect. The radiation dose is usually measured in [[Gray (unit)|grays]] (one gray (Gy) is the absorption of one [[joule]] of energy per kilogram of mass). A unit that attempts to take into account both the different organs that are irradiated and the type of radiation is the [[sievert]], a unit that describes both the amount of energy deposited and the biological effectiveness.

===Risks===
''[[The New York Times]]'' reported in December 2010 that radiation overdoses had occurred with the linear accelerator method of radiosurgery, due in large part to inadequate safeguards in equipment retrofitted for stereotactic radiosurgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/29/health/29radiation.html | title = A Pinpoint Beam Strays Invisibly, Harming Instead of Healing | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 2010-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulates these devices, whereas the Gamma Knife is regulated by the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]. The ''NYT'' article focused on [[Varian Medical Systems|Varian]] equipment and associated software, but the problem is likely not to be limited to that manufacturer.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

This is evidence that [[Cancer immunotherapy|immunotherapy]] may be useful for treatment of radiation necrosis following stereotactic radiotherapy.&lt;ref name="pmid28368903"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaidar-Person O, Zagar TM, Deal A, Moschos SJ, Ewend MG, Sasaki-Adams D, Lee CB, Collichio FA, Fried D, Marks LB, Chera BS |title=The incidence of radiation necrosis following stereotactic radiotherapy for melanoma brain metastases: the potential impact of immunotherapy |journal=Anticancer Drugs |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=669–675 |date=July 2017 |pmid=28368903 |doi=10.1097/CAD.0000000000000497 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of radiation source ==
The selection of the proper kind of radiation and device depends on many factors including lesion type, size, and location in relation to critical structures.  Data suggest that similar clinical outcomes are possible with all of the various techniques.  More important than the device used are issues regarding indications for treatment, total dose delivered, fractionation schedule and conformity of the treatment plan.

=== Gamma Knife ===
{{redirect|Gamma Knife|the album by Kayo Dot|Gamma Knife (album)}}
[[Image:Gamma Knife Graphic.jpg|thumb|[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|NRC]] graphic of the Leksell Gamma Knife]]
Gamma knife using Gamma radiation to treat the tumor cells especially in brain.
The Gamma Knife (also known as the Leksell Gamma Knife), a creation of [[Elekta|Elekta AB]], a Swedish public company, is used to treat [[brain tumors]] by administering high-intensity gamma radiation therapy in a manner that concentrates the radiation over a small volume. The device was invented in 1967 at the Karolinska Institute in [[Stockholm]], Sweden by Lars Leksell, Romanian-born neurosurgeon Ladislau Steiner, and [[radiobiologist]] Börje Larsson from [[Uppsala University]], Sweden. The first Gamma Knife was brought to the United States through an arrangement between US neurosurgeon [[Robert Wheeler Rand]] and Leksell and was given to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1979.

A Gamma Knife typically contains 201 [[cobalt-60]] sources of approximately 30&amp;nbsp;[[curie]]s (1.1&amp;nbsp;[[terabecquerel|TBq]]), each placed in a hemispheric array in a heavily [[Radiation protection|shielded]] assembly. The device aims [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]] through a target point in the patient's brain.  The patient wears a specialized helmet that is surgically fixed to the skull, so that the brain tumor remains stationary at the target point of the gamma rays. An [[ablation|ablative]] dose of radiation is thereby sent through the tumor in one treatment session, while surrounding brain tissues are relatively spared.

Gamma Knife therapy, like all radiosurgery, uses doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors, delivered precisely to avoid damaging healthy brain tissue. Gamma Knife radiosurgery is able to accurately focus many beams of gamma radiation on one or more tumors. Each individual beam is of relatively low intensity, so the radiation has little effect on intervening brain tissue and is concentrated only at the tumor itself.

Gamma Knife radiosurgery has proven effective for patients with benign or malignant brain tumors up to {{cvt|4|cm|in}} in size, [[Blood vessel|vascular]] malformations such as an [[arteriovenous malformation]] (AVM), pain, and other functional problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Régis J, Bartolomei F, Hayashi M, Chauvel P |title=What role for radiosurgery in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy |journal=Zentralbl.

=== Linear accelerator-based therapies ===
{{main|Megavoltage X-rays}}

A linear accelerator (linac) produces x-rays from the impact of accelerated electrons striking a high ''z'' target (usually tungsten).  A Linac therefore can generate x-rays of any energy, though usually 6&amp;nbsp;MV photons are used.  With a Linac the gantry moves in space to change the delivery angle. Linear accelerator equipment can also move the patient lying on the treatment couch to change the delivery point.  These treatments involve using a stereotactic frame to restrict the patient's movement. The Novalis Shaped Beam Radiosurgery system and Tx Radiosurgery platform, from Brainlab, implement a frameless, non-invasive technique with X-ray imaging that has proven to be both comfortable for the patient and accurate. The Trilogy from Varian, or CyberKnife from Accuray, can also be used with non-invasive immobilization devices coupled with real-time imaging to detect any patient motion during a treatment.

Linear accelerators emit high energy X-rays; the process is usually referred to as "X-ray therapy" or "photon therapy." The term "gamma ray" is usually reserved for photons that are emitted from a radioisotope such as cobalt-60 (see below). Such radiation is not substantially different from that emitted by high voltage accelerators. In linear accelerator therapy, the emission head (called "[[Gantry crane|gantry]]") is mechanically rotated around the patient, in a full or partial circle. The table where the patient is lying, the "couch", can also be moved in small linear or angular steps. The combination of the movements of the gantry and of the couch makes possible the computerized planning of the volume of tissue that is going to be irradiated. Devices with a high energy of 6&amp;nbsp;MeV are the most suitable for the treatment of the brain, due to the depth of the target. The diameter of the energy beam leaving the emission head can be adjusted to the size of the lesion by means of [[collimator]]s. They may be interchangeable orifices with different diameters, typically varying from 5 to 40&amp;nbsp;mm in 5&amp;nbsp;mm steps, or multileaf collimators, which consist of a number of metal leaflets that can be moved dynamically during treatment in order to shape the radiation beam to conform to the mass to be ablated. {{As of|2017}} Linacs are capable of achieving extremely narrow beam geometries, such as 0.15 to 0.3&amp;nbsp;mm. Therefore, they can be used for several kinds of surgeries which hitherto had been carried out by open or endoscopic surgery, such as for trigeminal neuralgia, etc. The exact mechanism of its effectiveness for trigeminal neuralgia is not known; however, its use for this purpose has become very common. Long-term follow-up data has shown it to be as effective as radiofrequency ablation, but inferior to surgery in preventing the recurrence of pain.

A type of linear accelerator therapy which uses a small accelerator mounted on a moving arm to deliver X-rays to a very small area which can be seen on fluoroscopy, is called Cyberknife therapy. Several generations of the frameless robotic Cyberknife system have been developed since its initial inception in 1990. It was invented by [[John R. Adler]], a [[Stanford University]] professor of neurosurgery and radiation oncology, and Russell and Peter Schonberg at Schonberg Research, and is sold by the Accuray company, located in [[Sunnyvale, California]], US. Many such CyberKnife systems are available worldwide.

Cyberknife may be compared to Gamma Knife therapy (see above), but it does not use gamma rays emitted by radioisotopes. It also does not use a frame to hold the patient, as a computer monitors the patient's position during treatment, using [[fluoroscopy]]. The robotic concept of Cyberknife radiosurgery allows the tumor to be tracked, rather than fixing the patient with a stereotaxic frame. Since no frame is needed, some of the radiosurgical concepts can be extended to treat extracranial tumors. In this case, the Cyberknife robotic arm tracks the tumor motion (i.e. respiratory motion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Schweikard Achim |author2=Shiomi Hiroya |author3=Adler John | year = 2004 | title = Respiration tracking in radiosurgery | url = | journal = Medical Physics | volume = 31 | issue = 10| pages = 2738–2741 | pmid = 15543778 | doi=10.1118/1.1774132}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A combination of stereo x-ray imaging and infrared tracking sensors determines the tumor position in real time.

=== Proton beam therapy ===
{{main|Proton therapy}}

Protons may also be used in radiosurgery in a procedure called '''Proton Beam Therapy''' (PBT) or [[proton therapy]]. Protons are extracted from proton donor materials by a medical [[synchrotron]] or [[cyclotron]], and accelerated in successive transits through a circular, evacuated conduit or cavity, using powerful magnets to shape their path, until they reach the energy required to just traverse a human body, usually about 200&amp;nbsp;MeV. They are then released toward the region to be treated in the patient's body, the irradiation target. In some machines, which deliver protons of only a specific energy, a custom mask made of plastic is interposed between the beam source and the patient to adjust the beam energy to provide the appropriate degree of penetration. The phenomenon of the [[Bragg peak]] of ejected protons gives proton therapy advantages over other forms of radiation, since most of the proton's energy is deposited within a limited distance, so tissue beyond this range (and to some extent also tissue inside this range) is spared from the effects of radiation. This property of protons, which has been called the "[[depth charge]] effect" by analogy to the explosive weapons used in anti-submarine warfare, allows for conformal dose distributions to be created around even very irregularly shaped targets, and for higher doses to targets surrounded or backstopped by radiation-sensitive structures such as the [[optic chiasm]] or brainstem. The development of "intensity modulated" techniques allowed similar conformities to be attained using linear accelerator radiosurgery.

{{As of|2013}} there was no evidence that proton therapy is better than any other types of treatment in most cases, except for a "handful of rare pediatric cancers". Critics, responding to the increasing number of very expensive PBT installations, spoke of a "medical [[arms race]]"  and "crazy medicine and unsustainable public policy".&lt;ref name="medscape.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/778466 |title=Uncertainty About Proton-Beam Radiotherapy Lingers |website=Medscape|date=30 January 2013  |author=Roxanne Nelson |accessdate= 22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rape}}
A '''rape fantasy''' (sometimes referred to as '''rapeplay''') or a '''ravishment''' is a [[sexual fantasy]] involving imagining or pretending being coerced or coercing another into [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]]. In [[sexual roleplay]], it involves acting out roles of [[Rape|coercive sex]]. [[Rape pornography]] is literature or images associated with rape and sometimes [[Stockholm syndrome]] as a means of [[sexual arousal]].

== Fantasy ==
Studies have found rape fantasy is a common sexual fantasy among both men and women. The fantasy may involve the fantasist as either the one being forced into sex or being the perpetrator. A 1974 study by Hariton and Singer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Specific Sexual Fantasy Themes: A Multidimensional Study |author1=William B. Arndt, Jr. |author2=John C. Foehl |author3=F. Elaine Good |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.48.2.472 |date=1985 |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=472–480 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that being "overpowered or forced to surrender" was the second most frequent fantasy in their survey; a 1984 study by Knafo and Jaffe ranked being overpowered as their study's most common fantasy during intercourse. In 1985, Louis H. Janda who is an associate professor of psychology at [[Old Dominion University]]&lt;ref&gt;no author. (2005, April 6) Louis H. Janda Associate Professor of Psychology. Retrieved on August 9, 2015, from [http://ww2.sci.odu.edu/psychology/directory/janda.shtml link]&lt;/ref&gt; said that the sexual fantasy of being raped is the most common sexual fantasy for women.&lt;!-- This is in the middle of page 334.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janda, L.H. (1985). How to live with an imperfect person. USA: Wellness Institute, Inc. {{ISBN|1-58741-007-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1988 study by Pelletier and Herold found that over half of their female respondents had fantasies of forced sex.&lt;!--This is in the left-middle of page 125.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R.F. (2001). Social Psychology and Human Sexuality: Essential Readings. Philadelphia, PA: Psychology Press. {{ISBN|1-84169-018-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most frequently cited hypothesis for why women fantasize of being forced and coerced into some sexual activity is that the fantasy avoids societally induced guilt—the woman does not have to admit responsibility for her sexual desires and behavior. A 1978 study by Moreault and Follingstad&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://uknowledge.uky.edu/crvaw_facpub/53/ |title=Sexual Fantasies of Females as a Function of Sex Guilt and Experimenta |author1=Denise Moreault |author2=Diane R. Follingstad |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.46.6.1385 |date=1978 |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=1385–1393 |pmid=730888 |accessdate=2014-06-16 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; was consistent with this hypothesis, and found that women with high levels of sex guilt were more likely to report fantasy themed around being overpowered, dominated, and helpless. In contrast, Pelletier and Herold used a different measure of guilt and found no correlation. Other research suggests that women who report forced sex fantasies have a more positive attitude towards sexuality, contradicting the guilt hypothesis.{{sfn|Strassberg|Lockerd|1998|p=405}} A 1998 study by Strassberg and Lockerd found that women who fantasized about force were generally less guilty and more [[erotophilia|erotophilic]], and as a result had more frequent and varied fantasies. However, it said that force fantasies are not the most common or the most frequent.{{sfn|Strassberg|Lockerd|1998|p=416}}

45.8% of men in a 1980 study reported fantasizing during heterosexual [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] about "a scene where [they had] the impression of being raped by a woman" (3.2% often and 42.6% sometimes), 44.7% of scenes where a seduced woman "pretends resisting" and 33% of raping a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crépault C, Couture M |title=Men's erotic fantasies |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=565–81 |year=1980 |pmid=7458662 |doi=10.1007/BF01542159 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A male sexual fantasy of raping a woman may bring sexual arousal either from imagining a scene in which first a woman objects but then comes to like and eventually participate in the intercourse, or else one in which the woman does not like it and arousal is associated with the idea of hurting the woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Arousal: The Secret Logic of Sexual Fantasies |last=Bader |first=Michael J. |year=2003 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |location= |isbn=0-312-30242-8 |page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of college-age women in 1998 found over half had engaged in fantasies of rape or coercion which, another study suggests, are simply "open and unrestricted" expressions of [[female sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Force in Women's Sexual Fantasies |last=Strassberg |first=Donald S. |last2=Locker |first2=Lisa K. |year=1998 |journal=Arch Sex Behav |issn=1573-2800 |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=403–414 |doi=10.1023/A:1018740210472 |pmid=9681121 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roleplay ==
One form of [[sexual roleplay]]ing is the rape fantasy, also called ravishment or forced sex roleplay. In [[BDSM]] circles (and occasionally outside these circles as well), some people choose to roleplay rape scenes—with communication, consent and safety being especially crucial elements. Though consent is a crucial component of any sexual roleplay, the illusion of non-consent (i.e. rape) is important to maintaining this type of fantasy. Due to this, the usage of a [[safeword]] is a logical safety measure, given that words that would normally halt sexual activity (i.e. stop) are often disregarded in these scenes. Continuing with the sexual roleplay after a safeword has been used constitutes [[sexual assault|assault]], as the use of a safeword indicates the withdrawal of consent.

Part of the [[Simulacra and Simulation|three order simulacra]], the '''second-order simulacra''', a term coined by [[Jean Baudrillard]], are [[symbol]]s of a non faithful representation to the original. Here, signs and images do not faithfully show us reality, but might hint at the existence of something real which the sign itself is incapable of encapsulating.&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard 1994 [1981], Simulacra and Simulation, University of Michigan Press, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

While the first-order simulacra is a faithful copy to the original and the third order are symbols that have become without referents, that is, symbols with no real object to represent but pretends to be a faithful copy of an original. Simply put, a third-order simulacra are symbols in themselves taken for reality and further layer of [[symbol]]ism is added. This occurs when the symbol is taken to be more important or authoritative of the original entity, authenticity has been replaced by copy (thus reality is replaced by a substitute).

The consequence of the propagation of second-order [[simulacra]] is that, within the affected context, nothing is "real," though those engaged in the illusion are incapable of seeing it. Instead of having experiences, people observe spectacles, via real or [[metaphor]]ical control screens. Instead of the real, we have simulation and simulacra, the [[Hyperreality|hyperreal]].

In his essay "The Precession of the Simulacra," Baudrillard recalls a tale from a short story by [[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]] in which a king requests a map (i.e. a symbol) to be produced so detailed that it ends up coming into one-to-one correspondence with the territory (i.e. the real area the map is to represent); this references the philosophical concept of [[map–territory relation]]. Baudrillard argues that in the [[postmodern]] epoch, the territory ceases to exist, and there is nothing left but the map; or indeed, the very concepts of the map and the territory have become indistinguishable, the distinction which once existed between them having been erased.

Among the many issues associated with the propagation of second-order simulacra to the third-order is what Baudrillard considers the termination of history. The method of this termination comes through the lack of oppositional elements in society, with the mass having become "the [[silent majority]]," an imploded concept which absorbs images passively, becoming itself a media overwritten by those who speak for it (i.e. the people are symbolically represented by governing agents and market statistic, marginalizing the people themselves). For Baudrillard this is the natural result of an ethic of unity in which actually agonistic opposites are taken to be essentially the same. For example, Baudrillard contends that [[moral universalism]] (human rights, equality) is equated with [[globalization]], which is not concerned with immutable values but with mediums of exchange and equalisation such as the global market and [[mass media]].

'''Symmetry breaking of escaping ants''' is a phenomenon that happens when [[ant]]s are constrained into a cell with two equivalent exits, and perturbed with an [[insect repellent]]. Contrary to intuition, ants tend to use one door more than the other on average (i.e., there is a  [[symmetry breaking]] in the escape behavior), so they crowd on one of the doors, which decreases the evacuation efficiency.

==Description==

The [[symmetry breaking]] phenomenon arises in experiments described as follows. Worker ants freshly collected from the field are enclosed into a circular cell with a glass cover in such a way that they can only move in two dimensions (i.e., ants cannot pass over each other). The cell has two exits located symmetrically relative to its center. We will describe first a "reference" experiment, and then the one where the "escape [[symmetry]]" is broken.

In the reference experiment, both doors are opened at the same time and let the ants escape. If the experiment is realized many times, in average we see that approximately the same number of ants use the left and the right doors. In this experiment the escape symmetry is not broken.

The second experiment involves a further step before opening the doors: an [[insect repellent]] fluid is poured into the cell at its center through a small hole in the glass cover. As a result, ants get very excited. If the experiment is realized many times, we see that the number of ants escaping by one of the doors (which can be randomly either the left one or the right ones) is significantly higher than the number of ants escaping by the other one, i.e., the escape symmetry is broken. The crowding of ants at one of the doors while the other one may be eventually free results in an inefficient evacuation in terms of time.

Geng Li and coworkers from Beijing Normal University tested whether and how the density of a group influenced symmetry breaking in escaping ants. They used the [[red imported fire ant]] (''Solenopsis invicta'') to repeat the experiment mentioned above with different total number of ants. The result shows that the symmetry breaking increases at low density but decreases after a peak. That is to say, when density is low, the ant group produces a collective escaping behavior; while at high density, the ant group behaves more like random particles.&lt;ref name="Li et al"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = G. | last2 = Huan | first2 = D. | last3 = Roehner | first3 = B. | last4 = Xu | first4 = Y.

== History==

Inspired by earlier computer simulations that predicted a symmetry breaking phenomenon when panicked humans escape from a room with two equivalent exits, E. Altshuler and coworkers from the [[University of Havana]] designed the experiment described in the section above, which revealed the symmetry breaking effect in the leaf-cutting ant ''[[Atta insularis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=E. Altshuler|title=Symmetry breaking in escaping ants|journal=American Naturalist|year=2005 |jstor=498139|doi=10.1086/498139|pmid=16475081|volume=166|issue=6|pages=643–649|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ant ''Atta insularis'' (commonly called ''bibijagua'' in Cuba) displays a high degree of [[swarm intelligence]], like most social insects, which has made them great survivors through millions of years of [[evolution]]. In Cuba, a person may be described as "smarter than ''bibijaguas''" (''"sabe mas que las bibijaguas"''). The poor evacuation efficiency illustrated by the phenomenon of symmetry breaking in escaping ants is one of the few examples where bibijaguas do not seem to behave collectively in a smart way.

==Explanations==

The basic idea is that the action of the repellent induces [[herd behavior]] in the ants. When ants are in "panic", they experience a strong tendency to follow each other. As a result, if a random fluctuation in the system produces a locally large amount of ants trying to reach one of the two doors, the fluctuation can be amplified because ants tend to follow the direction of the majority of individuals. Then, that specific door becomes crowded.

E. Altshuler and coworkers were able to reproduce their symmetry breaking experiments in ants using a simplified version of the theoretical model proposed earlier by Helbing et al. for humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=D. Helbing.|title= Simulating dynamical features of escape panic|journal=Nature|year=2000 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v407/n6803/full/407487a0.html|volume=407|issue=6803|pages=487–90|doi=10.1038/35035023|pmid=11028994|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the fact that walkers tend to follow the general direction of motion of their neighbors ("[[Vicsek's rule]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=T. Vicsek|title= A new type of phase transition in a system of self-driven particles|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |year=1995 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.1226|bibcode=1995PhRvL..75.1226V|volume=75|issue=6|pages=1226–1229|pmid=10060237|display-authors=etal|arxiv=cond-mat/0611743}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and such herd behavior increases as the so-called "panic parameter" increases. In the case of ants, the panic parameter is supposed to be low when no repellent is used, and high when the repellent is used.

A more "biologically-sensible" model based on the deposition of an alarm [[pheromone]] by ants under stress also reproduces the symmetry breaking phenomenon, with the advantage that it also predicts the experimental output for different concentrations of ants in the cell.&lt;ref name="Li et al" /&gt;

The pheromone mechanism shares the key element of the previous models: stressed ants tend to "follow the crowd".

==Ants vs. humans escaping in panic==
From the statistical point of view, human beings and ants seem to behave in a similar way in certain scenarios, such as evacuation from a room or cell under stress, resulting in symmetry breaking phenomena: while ants increase their tendency to follow each other under stress, human beings seem to forget about [[Emergency evacuation]] strategies, and  just run towards the door where most people run to. However, the enormous physical and behavioural differences between humans and ants imply also big differences in their [[collective behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=C. Detrain and J.-L. Deneubourg|title=Self-organized structures in a super-organism: do ants "behave" like molecules?|journal=Physics of Life Reviews |year=2006 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571064506000200|doi=10.1016/j.plrev.2006.07.001|volume=3|issue=3|pages=162–187|bibcode=2006PhLRv...3..162D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=S. Boari|title=Efficient egress of escaping ants stressed with temperature|journal=PLOS ONE |volume=8|issue=11|pages=e81082|year=2014 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0081082&amp;representation=PDF|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0081082|pmid=24312264|pmc=3843683|bibcode=2013PLoSO...881082B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the symmetry breaking experiment on ants, for example, the individuals are relatively "polite": rarely ants are crushed by other ants in the process or evacuation. When humans are in panic, however, deaths by overpressure or suffocation are common, like in the case of the [[Love Parade disaster]] occurred in [[Germany]] in 2010.

Videos on symmetry breaking in escaping ants are available on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PANICAntsEng| author=Complexperiments |year=2012 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rz8LNesxGs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Toxic units (TU)''' are used in the field of toxicology to quantify the interactions of [[toxicant]]s in binary mixtures of chemicals. A toxic unit for a given compound is based on the concentration at which there is a 50% effect (ex. [[EC50]]) for a certain biological endpoint. One toxic unit is equal to the EC50 for a given endpoint for a specific biological effect over a given amount of time. Toxic units allow for the comparison of the individual toxicities of a binary mixture to the combined toxicity. This allows researchers to categorize mixtures as additive, synergistic or antagonistic.  Synergism and antagonism are defined by mixtures that are more or less toxic than predicted by the sum of their toxic units.

[[Contamination|Contaminants]] are frequently present as mixtures in the environment. Regulatory decisions are based on mixture toxicity models that assume additivity, which can result in under or overestimation of toxic effects. Refining our understanding of mixture interactions can lead to better informed environmental management and decision making. In addition, exploring mixture interactions can elucidate the mechanisms of action for specific toxicants which, in many cases, are poorly understood.

== Methods ==
Application of toxic units requires toxicity data for the individual components of the mixture as well as specialized mixture toxicity data. Evaluating the response of each individual chemical allows researchers to generate a new dosing metric, toxic units, which is standardized to the toxicity of each chemical. Since the toxicity of two compounds may vary widely, 1 toxic unit of two different compounds could correspond to two very different concentrations on a per mass basis. In addition to the toxicity of the individual components, use of toxic units requires a 2x2 factorial design concentration series where the response is measured to an increase of each contaminant with the other contaminant held constant. This elaborate concentration series allows researchers to describe how the mixture components interact with each other and predict effects at untested combinations components with nonlinear regression models.

=== Point estimates ===
[[File:Concentration-response curve.jpg|thumb|Example of concentration-response model used to calculate EC50. Toxciant concentration is on the X-axis and biological response is on the Y-axis.]]
[[Point estimation]] is a technique to predict population parameters based on available sample data and can be used to relate the mass based concentration to a toxicity based metric. Point estimates in toxicology are frequently response endpoints on a [[Dose–response relationship|dose response curve]]. These point estimates predict at what concentration one would expect to see a given biological endpoint like 50% mortality ([[LC50]]). Any toxicological endpoint (growth inhibition, reproduction, behavior etc.) can be used as the toxicity metric to convert from mass based concentration to toxic units.

Point estimates are generated by fitting a [[nonlinear regression]] model to toxicity data and using that model to predict the concentration of chemical required to elicit a known response of the biological endpoint.

=== Equation and calculations ===
One Toxic unit can be defined by the researcher as the concentration of a given chemical required to cause a given toxicological endpoint ([[LC50]], [[EC50]], [[IC50]]).

ex. 1TU=LC50 or 1TU=IC50 for inhibition of growth

Since the mass or molar based concentrations of different chemicals required to cause a given endpoint like an LC50 may vary widely, the concentration that corresponds to 1TU is specific to each individual chemical tested.

=== Isobolograms ===

Isobolograms are one way to present the results of binary mixture toxicity testing based in toxic units.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Warne MSJ. 2003. A Review of the Ecotoxicity of Mixtures, Approaches to and Recommendations for, their Management. Proceedings of the Fifth National Workshop on the Assessment of Site Contamination. EPHC. pp.256&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of this method is it's simplicity and ease of use. First a line of additivity is plotted that corresponds to all the combinations of the two chemicals that would result in one toxic unit. Next the experimental results from binary mixture tests are plotted on the isobologram. The results from the mixture test are point estimates from the mixture dose response curves that correspond to the single chemical tests. When these mixture point estimates are plotted on the isobologram, the region that they fall into (based on the concentrations of the two chemicals required to cause that given endpoint) demonstrates whether the mixture interactions are [[Interaction#Biochemistry|additive]], [[Synergy#Drug synergy|synergistic]] or [[Antagonism (chemistry)|antagonistic]].

===Response surfaces===
[[File:F(x,y)=−((cosx)^2 + (cosy)^2)^2.PNG|thumb|Three dimensional graph depicting the function F(x,y) where x and y could be the concentration of the individual components in toxic units and the height of the graph depicts the toxicological response.]]Response surfaces are a more advanced and complex way to visualize the same information presented in an isobologram. A response surface is a three dimensional graph with concentrations of individual components in toxic units on the x and y axis and the response variable on the z axis. This three dimensional representation of the organisms response to the two chemical stressors can be used to predict the toxicity of any combination of the components based on the nonlinear regression models that form the response surface.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Antagonistic, additive, and synergistic effects ===
The primary utility of toxic units is to classify mixture interactions as additive, synergistic or antagonistic. Additivity means that the toxicity of the mixture is equal to the sum of the toxicities of the individual components. Additivity is the default assumption of models used to predict toxicity of mixtures for regulatory and environmental management purposes. Synergistic effects occur when the experimental toxicity of the mixture is greater than the sum of the individual toxicities. Conversely, antagonistic effects occur when the experimental toxicity of a mixture is less than would be predicted by additivity. Understanding mixture interactions can prevent over or underestimation of toxicity by regulators who assume additivity for uncategorized mixtures.

== Applications ==

=== Equilibrium partitioning sediment benchmarks ===
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. EPA]] uses toxic units as a benchmark, called the [[Equilibrium partitioning sediment benchmarks|equilibrium partitioning sediment benchmark (ESB)]], for predicting the toxicity of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]] (PAH)-contaminated sediments to benthic invertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 2003. Procedures for the derivation of ESBs for the protection of benthic organisms: PAH mixtures. EPA/600/R-02/013. Office of Research and Development, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Toxic units are calculated from sediment concentrations of 34 PAHs and their expected sediment, water, and lipid partitioning behavior. Based on the equilibrium partitioning approach (which accounts for the varying biological availability of chemicals in different sediments), the ESB for total PAH is the sum of the quotients of a minimum of each of the 34 individual PAHs in a specific sediment, divided by the final chronic value concentration for each specific PAH in sediment. According to the U.S. EPA, freshwater or saltwater sediments that contain less or equal to 1.0 toxic units of the mixture of the 34 PAHs or more PAHs are acceptable for the protection of benthic organisms. Sediments that are greater than 1.0 toxic units are not protective and potentially have adverse effects to benthic organisms.

U.S. EPA ESBs do not consider antagonistic, additive, or synergistic effects of other sediment contaminants and have been criticized as an overly conservative estimate for pyrogenic PAHs (such as those from manufactured gas plant processes).&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne SB, DJ Miller, and JP Kreitinger. 2006. Measurement of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations in sediments and toxic units used for estimating risk to benthic invertebrates at manufactured gas plant sites. ''Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry'' 25(1):287-296&lt;/ref&gt; This is in part due to the analytical approaches for determining the toxic units for both pyrogenic and petrogenic PAHs.

=== Toxicity identification evaluation ===
The toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) is an approach to systematically characterize, identify, and confirm toxic substances in whole sediments and sediment interstitial waters.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess RM and KT Ho. Sediment Toxicity Identification Evaluation. Chapter S, Ferard and Blaise (ed.), Encyclopedia of Aquatic Ecotoxicology. Springer, New York, NY, 8/13/2013:online, (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is typically carried out by the U.S. EPA. The effluent effect concentration data and the measured toxicant concentration data are transformed to toxic units for the regression analysis to evaluate whether a linear relationship exists between two or more toxicants.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 1993. Methods for Aquatic Toxicity Identification Evaluations: Phase III Toxicity Confirmation Procedures for Samples Exhibiting Acute and Chronic Toxicity. EPA/600/R-92/081. Office of Research and Development, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
The limitations associated with using Toxic Units are largely dependent on the methodology in which they are being used. For example, the use of isobolograms is applicable to only binary mixtures. In general, Toxic Units are based on point estimates which are limited by projection. Point estimates, and therefore Toxic Units, are a simplification of a [[Dose–response relationship|dose-response model]]. Information about toxic effects at concentrations other than the point estimate are lost in translation.

=== Alternative ways to study mixtures ===

==== Top-down Approach ====
A common method for studying mixtures is to measure the total toxicity of the mixture and consider the internal toxicant interactions as irrelevant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Any mixture effects are taken into account in the total toxicity. The results for this method are limited by being mixture specific and has limited value in determining specific mechanisms of toxicity.

==== GLM Approach ====
Using [[Generalized linear model|Generalized Linear Models (GLM)]] allows for complex, non-parametric model fitting to describe the toxicity complex mixtures. Generalized Linear Models are more likely to find significant differences from additivity than TU approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/37981637|title=Fundamentals of ecotoxicology|last=C.|first=Newman, Michael|date=1998|publisher=Ann Arbor Press|isbn=1575040131|oclc=37981637}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GLM approach also allows for the alteration of models to reflect current knowledge of biological mechanisms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Complex Mixtures: Methods for In Vivo Toxicity Testing|last=National Research Council (US) Committee on Methods for the In Vivo Toxicity Testing of Complex Mixtures|first=|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|year=1998|isbn=|location=Washington DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Forestry Center''' is a nonprofit educational institution in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]].  Located near the [[Oregon Zoo]] in [[Washington Park (Portland, Oregon)|Washington Park]], the organization was established in 1964{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} as the '''Western Forestry Center''', with the actual building opening in 1971.&lt;ref name="center opens"&gt;"New forestry center opens" (June 6, 1971).

[[File:P15exhibw.jpg|thumb|Forestry Building in 1905]]
The  World Forestry Center has its roots in the 1905 [[Lewis &amp; Clark Centennial Exposition|Lewis and Clark Centennial American Pacific Exposition and Oriental Fair]] for which an enormous [[log cabin]] was built of huge native trees and advertised as the world's largest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The center achieves its mission with three programs: the Discovery Museum, two donated working forests—the Magness Memorial Tree Farm and the Johnson-Swanson Tree Farm—and the World Forest Institute which was established in 1989. The primary program is the International Fellowship Program.

In 1989, the World Forestry Center established the World Forest Institute to meet a growing demand for forestry information.  As the forestry sector becomes increasingly complex, there is a greater need for international collaboration and exchange of information on forest trade, regulation, management, and forest resources. The World Forest Institute was created through the vision and support of [[Harry Merlo|Harry A. Merlo]], a pioneer of the forest products industry, and an early visionary of the globalization of the forestry sector.

The fellowship program brings young forestry and forest products professionals from around the world to work at the World Forest Institute for 6 to 12 months.  Fellows are commonly sponsored by their employer, government institutions, the forest industry, or an NGO, and carry out applied research projects of interest to their sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oregonlive.com/environment/index.ssf/2009/03/world_forestry_program_sends_a.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to completing a practical research project, the program works to get Fellows a broad exposure to natural resource management in the U.S. so that when they return to their home countries they have a basic understanding of the owners and managers of land and natural resources throughout the country.

The institute won the 2012 Portland Mayor's International Business Award from the Oregon Consular Corps.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFAaHSSvLro&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://portland4biz.com/portland-international-business-awards&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/05/in_downtown_portland_awards_an.html&lt;/ref&gt; This award recognizes businesses that contribute to a global environment in Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.portlandonline.com/mayor/?c=51108&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Forestry Center campus also accommodates three other buildings: Julian N. Cheatham Hall, Harold A. Miller Hall and Harry A. Merlo Hall, which houses the administrative offices and the World Forest Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
