'''Ambivalent sexism''' is a theoretical framework which posits that [[sexism]] has two sub-components: "hostile sexism" and "benevolent sexism". Hostile sexism reflects overtly negative evaluations and [[stereotype]]s about a [[gender]] (e.g., the ideas that women are incompetent and inferior to men). Benevolent sexism represents evaluations of gender that may appear subjectively positive (subjective to the person who is evaluating), but are actually damaging to people and [[gender equality]] more broadly (e.g., the ideas that women need to be protected by men). For the most part, [[Psychology|psychologists]] have studied hostile forms of sexism. However, theorists using the theoretical framework of ambivalent sexism have found extensive [[empirical evidence]] for both varieties. The theory has largely been developed by [[Social psychology|social psychologists]] Peter Glick and [[Susan Fiske]].

==General overview==
Sexism, like other forms of [[prejudice]], is a type of [[bias]] about a group of people. Sexism is founded in conceptualizations of one gender as being superior or having higher status than another gender in a particular domain, which can lead to [[discrimination]]. Research has indicated that stereotypes about socially appropriate [[gender role]]s for women and men are a driving factor in the endorsement of sexism.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00104.x |title=Hostile and Benevolent Sexism |year=1997 |last1=Glick |first1=Peter |last2=Fiske |first2=Susan T. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=21 |pages=119–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patriarchy]], defined as men's power and "structural control over political, legal, economic, and religious institutions",&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1997"/&gt; is a feature of sexism and is related to hostile attitudes toward women. [[Anthropology|Anthropological]] research suggests that patriarchy is pervasive among the majority of human societies, such that women have been systematically discriminated against, [[Oppression|oppressed]], and [[Marginalization|marginalized]] by men throughout history.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1997"/&gt; Sexism maintains patriarchal [[social structure]]s and reinforces prescribed gender roles.

Typically, sexism is thought of as hostility toward women, perpetrated by men. However, both women and men can (and often do) endorse sexist beliefs about each other and themselves. In other words, men can express sexist attitudes about women or men, and women can express sexist attitudes about men or women. While sexism has historically disadvantaged women, there are negative consequences of sexism for both men and women.&lt;ref name="Roets, A. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/per.843 |title=Is Sexism a Gender Issue? A Motivated Social Cognition Perspective on Men's and Women's Sexist Attitudes Toward Own and Other Gender |year=2012 |last1=Roets |first1=Arne |last2=Van Hiel |first2=Alain |last3=Dhont |first3=Kristof |journal=European Journal of Personality |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=350–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rigid gender roles can be damaging to women and men alike, restricting opportunities and promoting gender-based prejudice. For the purposes of this article, sexism toward women will be the focus, as it is most relevant to the definition and study of ambivalent sexism.

Ambivalent sexism offers a multidimensional reconceptualization of the traditional view of sexism to include both subjectively benevolent and hostile attitudes toward women.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1996"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.3.491 |title=The Ambivalent Sexism Inventory: Differentiating hostile and benevolent sexism |year=1996 |last1=Glick |first1=Peter |last2=Fiske |first2=Susan T. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=491–512}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "ambivalent" is used to describe the construal of sexism because this type of bias includes both negative and positive evaluations of women. The addition of a benevolent feature to definitions of gender-based prejudice was a major contribution to the study of sexism and field of psychology. Traditional conceptualizations of sexism focused almost entirely on overt hostility toward women. While historians, anthropologists, [[Feminist theory|feminist scholars]], and psychologists had previously suggested that sexism involves positive and negative evaluations of women, the majority of empirical research at the time evaluated only hostile expressions of sexism.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.56.2.109 |title=An ambivalent alliance: Hostile and benevolent sexism as complementary justifications for gender inequality |year=2001 |last1=Glick |first1=Peter |last2=Fiske |first2=Susan T. |journal=American Psychologist |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=109–18 |pmid=11279804}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI)—a scale which was developed by Glick and Fiske in 1996, and which assesses ambivalently sexist attitudes—marks a shift in how sexism is construed and scientifically measured. Glick and Fiske created the ASI to address a proposed deficiency in the measurement of sexism at the time.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1996"/&gt; They argue that previous scales assessing sexism do not adequately capture the ambivalent nature of gender-based prejudice toward women.

==Theoretical framework==

Glick and Fiske assert that hostile and benevolent sexism complement each other in reinforcing [[tradition]]al gender roles and preserving patriarchal social structures of women as subordinate to men. Both forms of sexism share the assumption that women are inferior and restrict women to a lower [[social status]]. Hostile sexism reflects [[misogyny]] (i.e., the hatred of women by men) and is expressed through blatant negative evaluations of women.&lt;ref name="Glick, P., Diebold, J., Bailey-Werner, B., &amp; Zhu, L., 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/01461672972312009 |title=The Two Faces of Adam: Ambivalent Sexism and Polarized Attitudes Toward Women |year=1997 |last1=Glick |first1=P. |last2=Diebold |first2=J. |last3=Bailey-Werner |first3=B. |last4=Zhu |first4=L. |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=23 |issue=12 |pages=1323–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of hostile sexism include beliefs about women as incompetent, unintelligent, overly emotional, and sexually manipulative. Benevolent sexism reflects evaluations of women that are seemingly positive. Examples of benevolently sexist attitudes include the reverence of women in wife, mother, and child caretaker roles, the romanticizing of women as objects of [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] affection, and the belief that men have a duty to protect women.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1996"/&gt; While benevolent sexism may not appear to be harmful to women on the surface, these beliefs are extremely caustic to gender equity and restrict women's personal, professional, political, and social opportunities. This is because these seemingly positive evaluations imply that (a) women are weak and need to be protected, (b) women should not deviate from traditional gender roles as mothers and caretakers, and (c) women should be idolized by men for their [[sexual purity]] and availability.

Because benevolently sexist attitudes appear positive, people often do not identify these beliefs as a form of gender-based prejudice. Furthermore, benevolent sexism may be seen by both men and women as reinforcing of the status quo, which some individuals may find comforting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684312456369 |title=Why is Benevolent Sexism Appealing?: Associations with System Justification and Life Satisfaction |year=2012 |last1=Connelly |first1=K. |last2=Heesacker |first2=M. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=432–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social and cultural [[norm (social)|norm]]s may encourage benevolently sexist beliefs among women and men. A classic illustration of this is the endorsement of [[Chivalry#Modern manifestations and revivals|modern-day chivalry]] in interactions between women and men.&lt;ref name="Herzog, S. &amp; Oreg, S., 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1540-5893.2008.00334.x |title=Chivalry and the Moderating Effect of Ambivalent Sexism: Individual Differences in Crime Seriousness Judgments |year=2008 |last1=Herzog |first1=Sergio |last2=Oreg |first2=Shaul |journal=Law &amp; Society Review |volume=42 |pages=45–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be considered traditional and polite for a man to insist that he holds a door open or carries a heavy object for a woman. However, this tradition is founded in historical representations of women as weaker than men. In these types of circumstances, people may find it difficult to distinguish between kindness, tradition, and benevolent sexism. Men and women often disagree on whether or not a specific incident should be considered sexist.&lt;ref name="Guteg, B. A., &amp; O'Conner, M., 1995"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1995.tb01314.x |title=The Empirical Basis for the Reasonable Woman Standard |year=1995 |last1=Gutek |first1=Barbara A. |last2=O'Connor |first2=Maureen |journal=Journal of Social Issues |volume=51 |pages=151–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, women and men tend to show more agreement in classifying extreme and overt expressions of sexism.&lt;ref name="Guteg, B. A., &amp; O'Conner, M., 1995"/&gt; Hostile sexism is typically easier for people to identify as an expression of prejudice.&lt;ref name="Chisango, T. &amp; Javangwe, G., 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11199-012-0146-2 |title=Are People Better at Recognizing Ambivalent Sexism on the Basis of the Non-standard Profiles than the Standard ASI Ones? |year=2012 |last1=Chisango |first1=Tadios |last2=Javangwe |first2=Gwatirera |journal=Sex Roles |volume=67 |pages=69–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, women are rarely perceived by others in an entirely hostile or benevolent manner. In fact, people frequently report high levels of both benevolent and hostile sexism.&lt;ref name="Glick et al., 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.5.763 |title=Beyond prejudice as simple antipathy: Hostile and benevolent sexism across cultures |year=2000 |last1=Glick |first1=Peter |last2=Fiske |first2=Susan T. |last3=Mladinic |first3=Antonio |last4=Saiz |first4=José L. |last5=Abrams |first5=Dominic |last6=Masser |first6=Barbara |last7=Adetoun |first7=Bolanle |last8=Osagie |first8=Johnstone E. |last9=Akande |first9=Adebowale |last10=Alao |first10=Amos |last11=Brunner |first11=Barbara |last12=Willemsen |first12=Tineke M. |last13=Chipeta |first13=Kettie |last14=Dardenne |first14=Benoit |last15=Dijksterhuis |first15=Ap |last16=Wigboldus |first16=Daniel |last17=Eckes |first17=Thomas |last18=Six-Materna |first18=Iris |last19=Expósito |first19=Francisca |last20=Moya |first20=Miguel |last21=Foddy |first21=Margaret |last22=Kim |first22=Hyun-Jeong |last23=Lameiras |first23=Maria |last24=Sotelo |first24=Maria José |last25=Mucchi-Faina |first25=Angelica |last26=Romani |first26=Myrna |last27=Sakalli |first27=Nuray |last28=Udegbe |first28=Bola |last29=Yamamoto |first29=Mariko |last30=Ui |first30=Miyoko  |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=79 |issue=5 |pages=763–75 |pmid=11079240}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are individual differences in people's levels of benevolent and hostile sexism, such that a person can be rated highly on both, one, or neither dimension of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory. In addition, women are not immune from endorsing sexist beliefs about women. Extensive research supports the idea that it is common for women and men to support ambivalently sexist attitudes about women.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684311414832 |title=Ambivalent Sexism Revisited |year=2011 |last1=Glick |first1=P. |last2=Fiske |first2=S. T. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=530–5|pmc=3896071 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, people find it difficult to believe that others can endorse both benevolent and hostile sexism.&lt;ref name="Chisango, T. &amp; Javangwe, G., 2012"/&gt; Research suggests that, when individuals are shown profiles of a benevolently sexist man and a man who endorses hostile sexism, they feel that it is very unlikely that one person can embody both forms of bias.&lt;ref name="Kilianski, S. E., &amp; Rudman, L. A., 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Wanting It Both Ways: Do Women Approve of Benevolent Sexism?|doi=10.1023/A:1018814924402 |year=1998 |last1=Kilianski |first1=Stephen E. |last2=Rudman |first2=Laurie A. |journal=Sex Roles |volume=39 |issue=5/6 |pages=333–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sub-components and dimensions==

Social psychologists have suggested that sexism may be inherently different from other forms of ambivalent prejudice, in that there is interdependency between women and men in social structures.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 2011"/&gt; A central argument to the theory of ambivalent sexism is the idea that there is a complicated balance of power between men and women, such that men have structural power and women have dyadic power (stemming from dependence between two people). Dyadic power reflects the notion that men depend on women to fulfill certain goals, such as heterosexual [[intimacy]] and childbearing. Glick and Fiske assert that men's dependence on women is what fuels benevolently sexist attitudes, leading to idolization and the placing of women on a pedestal.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1996"/&gt; In other words, power relationships between men and women foster an ambivalent form of bias towards women.

Theoretically, each form of sexism is composed of three subcomponents: [[paternalism]], gender differentiation, and heterosexuality.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1997"/&gt; Paternalism reflects views of women as underdeveloped adults, providing justification for men to be authoritative and monitor, protect, and make decisions on women's behalf. Gender differentiation promotes the assumption that biological differences between males and females justify the strict adherence to socially prescribed gender roles. Heterosexuality—described as the most prominent cause of men's ambivalence toward women—reflects a tension between genuine desires for closeness and intimacy and a fear of women attaining power over men through sexual attraction.

Within hostile sexism (HS) and benevolent sexism (BS), the three subcomponents serve distinct functions. Dominative paternalism (HS) suggests that men should control women, while protective paternalism (BS) implies that men should protect and care for women. Competitive gender differentiation (HS) bolsters men's self-confidence (e.g., men are superior to women). Complementary gender differentiation (BS) places importance on traditional gender roles for women (e.g., mother &amp; wife) and assumes that men depend on women to fulfill these roles. Lastly, heterosexual hostility (HS) views women as [[Sexual objectification|sexual objects]] for men's pleasure and promotes the fear of women's capacity to manipulate men by engaging in or withholding sexual activity. Intimate heterosexuality (BS) romanticizes women as having sexual purity and views romantic intimacy as necessary to complete a man.

==Ambivalent Sexism Inventory==

Researchers typically measure ambivalent sexism at the individual level. The primary method used to measure an individual's endorsement of ambivalent sexism is the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI), created by Glick and Fiske in 1996. The ASI is a 22-item [[Self-report inventory|self-report measure]] of sexism on which respondents indicate their level of agreement with various statements, which are placed on a 6-point [[Likert scale]].&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1996"/&gt; It is composed of two sub-scales that may be independently calculated for sub-scale scores or may be averaged for an overall composite sexism score. The first sub-scale is the hostile sexism scale, which is composed of 11 items designed to assess an individual's position on the dimensions of dominative paternalism, competitive gender differentiation, and heterosexual hostility, as previously defined. A sample item from the hostile sexism sub-scale is "Women are too easily offended." The second sub-scale is the benevolent sexism scale, which is composed of 11 items that aim to assess an individual's position on the dimensions of protective paternalism, complementary gender differentiation, and heterosexual intimacy, as previously defined. A sample item from the benevolent sexism sub-scale is "Women should be cherished and protected by men."

Over fifteen years of additional research and replications support that this inventory possesses [[psychometric]] characteristics indicating that the measure is both empirically reliable and valid. Standard criteria in psychological research can be utilized to evaluate a scale.&lt;ref name="McHugh, M. C., &amp; Frieze, I. H., 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00097.x |title=The Measurement of Gender-Role Attitudes A Review and Commentary |year=1997 |last1=McHugh |first1=Maureen C. |last2=Frieze |first2=Irene Hanson |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=21 |pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using statistics, a [[Cronbach's alpha]] coefficient can be calculated to indicate whether items on a scale seem to be measuring the same psychological construct or dimension (demonstrating the retestability of a scale). Generally, researchers agree that a Cronbach's alpha coefficient above 0.80 suggests strong reliability in a scale. The ASI has consistently demonstrated this empirical reliability over time.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 2011"/&gt; In addition, empirical evaluations of the ASI provide support for the validity of the scale, such that the inventory seems to effectively measure what it proposes to assess: a polarized attitude towards women, where both dimensions can be activated simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 2011"/&gt;

The utility of the ASI is not limited to English speakers.&lt;ref name="Dardenne, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4074/S0003503306002041 |title=Structure latente et validation de la version française de l'Ambivalent Sexism Inventory : l'échelle de sexisme ambivalent |trans-title=Latent Structure of the French Validation of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory : Échelle de Sexisme Ambivalent |language=French |year=2009 |last1=Dardenne |first1=Benoit |last2=Delacollette |first2=Nathalie |last3=Grégoire |first3=Christine |last4=Lecocq |first4=Delphine |journal=L'Année psychologique |volume=106 |issue=2 |pages=235–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is extensive support for the cross-cultural validity of the ASI. A cross-cultural study examining the theory of ambivalent sexism in 19 countries found that hostile and benevolent components of sexism are not culturally specific.&lt;ref name="Glick et al., 2000"/&gt; Furthermore, research suggests that ambivalently sexist attitudes towards men exist, such that hostile and benevolent attitudes toward men are found cross-culturally.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.86.5.713 |title=Bad but Bold: Ambivalent Attitudes Toward Men Predict Gender Inequality in 16 Nations |year=2004 |last1=Glick |first1=Peter |last2=Lameiras |first2=Maria |last3=Fiske |first3=Susan T. |last4=Eckes |first4=Thomas |last5=Masser |first5=Barbara |last6=Volpato |first6=Chiara |last7=Manganelli |first7=Anna Maria |last8=Pek |first8=Jolynn C.

===Critiques===

While the ASI is widely used and accepted among researchers,&lt;ref name="Kilianski, S. E., &amp; Rudman, L. A., 1998"/&gt; one limitation of the ASI is that it is a self-reported measure.&lt;ref name="Sakalli-Ugurlu, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00223980209604825 |title=Turkish College Students' Attitudes Toward Women Managers: The Effects of Patriarchy, Sexism, and Gender Differences |year=2002 |last1=Sakalli-Ugurlu |first1=Nuray |last2=Beydogan |first2=Basak |journal=The Journal of Psychology |volume=136 |issue=6 |pages=647–56 |pmid=12523452}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social desirability]] is a common limitation of self-report measures in survey research; when participants in a research study complete a written self-report questionnaire, respondents are vulnerable to answering the items in a socially desirable manner. For this reason, some researchers employ variations of the ASI in their study designs that do not require self-reports. For example, Dardeene, Dumont, and Bollier (2007) transformed some items from the ASI into scenarios, presenting them to participants to induce conditions of both hostile and benevolent sexism.&lt;ref name="Dardenne, 2006"/&gt; Hebl, King, Glick, Singletary, and Kazama (2007) designed a field study in which they observed the sexist behaviors of others; they used the theory of ambivalent sexism and the ASI to generate items for their own measure to assess these observed behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.92.6.1499 |title=Hostile and benevolent reactions toward pregnant women: Complementary interpersonal punishments and rewards that maintain traditional roles |year=2007 |last1=Hebl |first1=Michelle R. |last2=King |first2=Eden B. |last3=Glick |first3=Peter |last4=Singletary |first4=Sarah L. |last5=Kazama |first5=Stephanie |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=1499–511 |pmid=18020792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism of the ASI is that the labels of the two sub-constructs, "benevolent" and "hostile", are too abstract, do not generalize to certain languages, and may not be relevant to some cultures.&lt;ref name="Chisango, T. &amp; Javangwe, G., 2012"/&gt;

Lastly, findings from the Conn, Hanges, Sipe, and Salvaggio (1999) study suggest that other sexism scales may measure ambivalent attitudes towards women.&lt;ref name="Conn, A., Paul, H., Sipe, W., &amp; Salvaggio, A., 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/00131649921970242 |title=The Search for Ambivalent Sexism: A Comparison of Two Measures |year=1999 |last1=Conn |first1=A. B. |last2=Hanges |first2=P. J. |last3=Sipe |first3=W. P. |last4=Salvaggio |first4=A. N. |journal=Educational and Psychological Measurement |volume=59 |issue=6 |pages=898–909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glick and Fiske originally proposed the theoretical framework of ambivalent sexism as filling a gap in the psychological literature and providing a novel tool for assessing a new dimension of sexism: benevolent sexism.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1996"/&gt; However, Conn and colleagues (1999), using [[confirmatory factor analysis]], showed that the Modern Sexism Scale (Swim, Aikin, Hall, and Hunter, 1995) captures ambivalent sentiments toward women, such that it identifies individuals that appear nonsexist but actually endorse sexist attitudes.&lt;ref name="Conn, A., Paul, H., Sipe, W., &amp; Salvaggio, A., 1999"/&gt; Results from this study suggest that, while both the Modern Sexism Scale and the ASI assess ambivalence toward women, the ASI is unique in its capabilities for separately measuring both hostile and benevolent attitudes. In addition, the ASI captures heterosexual intimacy and benevolent paternalism, whereas the Modern Sexism Scale does not.

==Empirical support==

While many individuals{{specify|date=July 2018}} endorse both benevolent and hostile sexism simultaneously, research{{by whom|date=July 2018}} suggests that people rated significantly higher in one of the two sub-components have distinct constellations of beliefs and patterns of behavior. In other words, someone who is high in benevolent sexism tends to show a different profile of attitudes than someone who is high in hostile sexism. The independence of these types of sexism in predicting human behavior indicates that the two are, in fact, discrete forms of bias on separate but related axes. Examples of research findings identifying disparate outcomes between benevolent sexism and hostile sexism are described below. In addition, the relationships between ambivalent sexism and a range of other related attitudes and behaviors are discussed.

===Attitudes toward sexual harassment, intimate partner violence, and rape===

Men who are ambivalently sexist (i.e., high in both benevolent and hostile sexism simultaneously) and men who are high in hostile sexism are more likely to tolerate the [[sexual harassment]] of women than men who are benevolently sexist.&lt;ref name="Russell, B. L., &amp; Trigg, K., 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/B:SERS.0000023075.32252.fd |title=Tolerance of Sexual Harassment: An Examination of Gender Differences, Ambivalent Sexism, Social Dominance, and Gender Roles |year=2004 |last1=Russell |first1=Brenda L. |last2=Trigg |first2=Kristin Y. |journal=Sex Roles |volume=50 |issue=7/8 |pages=565–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, hostile sexism is associated with acceptance of sexual harassment.&lt;ref name="Begany, J., &amp; Milburn, M., 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/1524-9220.3.2.119 |title=Psychological predictors of sexual harassment: Authoritarianism, hostile sexism, and rape myths |year=2002 |last1=Begany |first1=Joseph J. |last2=Milburn |first2=Michael A. |journal=Psychology of Men &amp; Masculinity |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=119–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the endorsement of hostile sexism is related to attitudes about [[intimate partner violence]] perpetrated by men towards women, such that people that are high in hostile sexism are more tolerant of intimate partner violence.&lt;ref name="Glick, P., Sakalli-Ugurlu, N., Ferreira, M., &amp; de Souza, M. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1471-6402.t01-1-00068 |title=Ambivalent Sexism and Attitudes Toward Wife Abuse in Turkey and Brazil |year=2002 |last1=Glick |first1=Peter |last2=Sakalli-Ugurlu |first2=Nuray |last3=Ferreira |first3=Maria Cristina |last4=Aguiar De Souza |first4=Marcos |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=292–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benevolently sexist attitudes were not found to be a significant predictor of the tolerance of intimate partner violence. However, the endorsement of benevolent sexism was not a protective factor either. Lastly, men high in hostile sexism are more likely to rape women, whereas men that are high in benevolent sexism are more likely to [[Victim-blaming|blame a victim]] of rape for the attack.&lt;ref name="Viki &amp; Abrams, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |title=But She Was Unfaithful: Benevolent Sexism and Reactions to Rape Victims Who Violate Traditional Gender Role Expectations|doi=10.1023/A:1021342912248 |year=2002 |last1=Viki |first1=G. Tendayi |last2=Abrams |first2=Dominic |journal=Sex Roles |volume=47 |issue=5/6 |pages=289–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Close relationships and attraction===

Research has shown that sexist attitudes relate to preferences for certain characteristics in romantic partners.&lt;ref name="Sibley &amp; Overall, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684311401838 |title=A Dual Process Motivational Model of Ambivalent Sexism and Gender Differences in Romantic Partner Preferences |year=2011 |last1=Sibley |first1=C. G. |last2=Overall |first2=N. C. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=303–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests that women with higher levels of benevolent sexism have more stereotypical preferences in men as romantic partners, such as financial security and resources. Men with higher levels of hostile sexism are more likely to value physical attractiveness in women as romantic partners. In addition, benevolent sexism tends to predict mate selection, whereas hostile sexism tend to predict subsequent marriage norms after pairing.&lt;ref name="Chen, Fiske, &amp; Lee, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9585-9 |title=Ambivalent Sexism and Power-Related Gender-role Ideology in Marriage |year=2009 |last1=Chen |first1=Zhixia |last2=Fiske |first2=Susan T. |last3=Lee |first3=Tiane L. |journal=Sex Roles |volume=60 |issue=11–12 |pages=765–778 |pmid=24058258 |pmc=3777654}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women find men high in benevolent sexism attractive, and rate men high in ambivalent sexism as less attractive.&lt;ref name="Bohner, Ahlborn, &amp; Steiner, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9665-x |title=How Sexy are Sexist Men? Women's Perception of Male Response Profiles in the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory |year=2009 |last1=Bohner |first1=Gerd |last2=Ahlborn |first2=Katrin |last3=Steiner |first3=Regine |journal=Sex Roles |volume=62 |issue=7–8 |pages=568–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in a recent research study on a particular aspect of benevolent sexism, protective paternalistic beliefs, women endorsed more protective paternalistic beliefs for men (toward women) in romantic versus work contexts. The endorsement of these beliefs in romantic contexts is thought to serve to reinforce and maintain such benevolent sexist behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684312454842 |title=Prescription of Protective Paternalism for Men in Romantic and Work Contexts |year=2012 |last1=Sarlet |first1=M. |last2=Dumont |first2=M. |last3=Delacollette |first3=N. |last4=Dardenne |first4=B. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=444–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, benevolent sexism and hostile sexism are associated with beliefs that [[premarital sex]] is unacceptable for women.&lt;ref name="Sakalli-Ugurlu &amp; Glick, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00224490309552194 |title=Ambivalent sexism and attitudes toward women who engage in premarital sex in Turkey |year=2003 |last1=Sakalh‐Uğurlu |first1=Nuray |last2=Glick |first2=Peter |journal=Journal of Sex Research |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=296–302 |pmid=14533024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in the workplace===

While the consequences of hostile sexism in the workplace are more widely known and accepted, research has shown that benevolent sexism may have a more severe impact on a women's cognitive performance.&lt;ref name="Dardenne, 2006"/&gt; Dardenne, et al.(2006) suggested that hostile sexism can elicit anger or frustration in the target, which may increase her motivation to succeed or perform. Benevolent sexism, because of its seemingly positive evaluations and implicit attributions, is likely to hinder a woman's confidence and performance. The researchers showed that, in a typical team working environment, hostile sexism as well as benevolent sexism had consequences for the participant's performance. Masser and Abrams (2004) highlighted the fact that previous research has shown that benevolent sexism can have detrimental effects on a woman's performance evaluation if that woman violates social norms associated with certain sexist attitudes.&lt;ref name="Masser, B. M.&amp; Abrams, D., 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11199-004-5470-8 |title=Reinforcing the Glass Ceiling: The Consequences of Hostile Sexism for Female Managerial Candidates |year=2004 |last1=Masser |first1=Barbara M. |last2=Abrams |first2=Dominic |journal=Sex Roles |volume=51 |issue=9–10 |pages=609–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their study showed that hostile sexism, but not benevolent sexism, hurt women's evaluations and recommendations for promotion.

Additionally, studies have shown that benevolent sexist attitudes lead to lower professional evaluations from men and women.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Masser, B. M.&amp; Abrams, D., 2004"/&gt; Using an experimental design, Masser and Abrams (2004) found that individuals with hostile sexist attitudes rated women lower when applying for a male-dominant position. Additionally, high hostile sexist individuals recommend men to fill the available position more often than women. The authors argue that this is one of the main contributors to the [[glass ceiling]] effect.

===Help-seeking===

In a recent experimental study on the effects of benevolent sexism on [[help-seeking]] behaviors, researchers found that, when stereotypes of women as dependent were made salient, female college students were less willing to seek help. In addition, the more that help was sought, the worse women felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684312457659 |title=Thanks, but No Thanks: Women's Avoidance of Help-Seeking in the Context of a Dependency-Related Stereotype |year=2012 |last1=Wakefield |first1=J. R. H. |last2=Hopkins |first2=N. |last3=Greenwood |first3=R. M. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=423–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, benevolent sexism appears to hold consequences towards women's help-seeking when certain benevolent sexist stereotypes are made salient.

=== Voting Behaviour ===
During the 2016 US Presidential Election, researchers connected ambivalent sexism to voting intentions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2016/10/10/a-basket-of-deplorables-a-new-study-finds-that-trump-supporters-are-more-likely-to-be-islamophobic-racist-transphobic-and-homophobic/|title=A ‘basket of deplorables’? A new study finds that Trump supporters are more likely to be Islamophobic, racist, transphobic and homophobic.|date=2016-10-10|newspaper=USAPP|last1=Blair |first1= Karen L. |language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a non-representative sample of US voters, predominantly male, ambivalent sexism was found to be the sole predictor of intending to vote for someone other than Hillary Clinton in the election. For every step up on the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory, participants were 3.3 times more likely to be voting for someone other than Hillary Clinton. Of those not voting for Clinton, they were not necessarily being pulled over to the Trump campaign, but rather, many were intending to vote Third Party or were still undecided. While higher Islamophobia predicted a vote for Trump, lower Islamophobia and ''higher'' ambivalent sexism predicted being undecided or voting for a Third Party.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Women's endorsement of ambivalent sexism==

Both benevolent and hostile sexism are considered legitimizing ideologies, in that these attitudes provide the justification for social inequalities between men and women.&lt;ref name="Sidanius, Pratto, &amp; Bobo, 1994"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.998 |title=Social dominance orientation and the political psychology of gender: A case of invariance? |year=1994 |last1=Sidanius |first1=Jim |last2=Pratto |first2=Felicia |last3=Bobo |first3=Lawrence |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=998–1011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social dominance orientation]] (SDO; Sidanius &amp; Pratto, 1999) asserts that group-based inequalities are systematically reinforced by the disadvantaged group's adoption of the dominant group's ideology and social stratification.&lt;ref name="Sidanius &amp; Pratto 1999"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sidanius |first1=Jim |last2=Pratto |first2=Felicia |year=1999 |title=Social Dominance: An Intergroup Theory of Social Hierarchy and Oppression |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-62290-5}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical research has consistently supported the validity of Social Dominance Theory,&lt;ref name="Gaucher, Frieser, &amp; Kay, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0022530 |title=Evidence that gendered wording in job advertisements exists and sustains gender inequality |year=2011 |last1=Gaucher |first1=Danielle |last2=Friesen |first2=Justin |last3=Kay |first3=Aaron C. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=101 |pages=109–28 |pmid=21381851 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the SDO model of structural oppression may be particularly apt to describe how patriarchy is perpetuated.&lt;ref name="Sibley et al, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9554-8 |title=Your Sexism Predicts My Sexism: Perceptions of Men's (but not Women's) Sexism Affects One's Own Sexism over Time |year=2008 |last1=Sibley |first1=Chris G. |last2=Overall |first2=Nickola C. |last3=Duckitt |first3=John |last4=Perry |first4=Ryan |last5=Milfont |first5=Taciano L. |last6=Khan |first6=Sammyh S. |last7=Fischer |first7=Ronald |last8=Robertson |first8=Andrew |journal=Sex Roles |volume=60 |issue=9–10 |pages=682–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have explored reasons for why women might [[Internalisation (sociology)|internalize]] ambivalently sexist attitudes towards women. Fischer (2006) found that women may develop benevolently sexist attitudes as a response to experiencing sexism themselves.&lt;ref name="Fischer, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2006.00316.x |title=Women's Benevolent Sexism As Reaction to Hostility |year=2006 |last1=Fischer |first1=Ann R. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=410–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross-cultural research suggests that women's endorsement of benevolent sexism often reflects a culture of extreme hostile sexism among men in a given community.&lt;ref name="Glick et al., 2000"/&gt; Some researchers argue that, in cultures that are particularly hostile, women may internalize benevolent sexism as a protective mechanism.

An '''architectural educator''' is one who [[education|educates]] ("draws out") others about [[architecture]]; the latter being the broad subject of the [[design]] of constructed [[built environment|environment]]s.  [[Architectural Education]] has both [[public architectural education]] and [[professional architectural education]] stakeholder groups. The career of an architectural educator usually develops from a career in architecture or developed interest and practise in architecture and/or education about architecture.

Educating people about architecture as a system of placing things in the world, which was once considered an elite or sacred form of "knowledge".  Architecture was "archaically" defined in Western history, for example, by [[Marcus Vitruvius Pollio]] (Rome c. 40 BC) as a culturally "higher order".  Yet in writing ''De Re Architectura Libri Decem'' (''On Architecture, in Ten Books''), Vitruvius also formalised written Western architectural education.  Many other cultures have aural and tactile non-textual architectural education traditions.  Contemporary education about the order and placement of things can equally be regarded as a [[hermeneutic]] (in [[Schleiermacher]]'s sense): as developing citizens' understanding about the ecological significance of arrangements of people and things in particular human environments.

Architectural educators may work in the service of the architectural profession or in the wider community. In the architectural profession, architectural education in many countries is guided or regulated by validation or [[School accreditation|accreditation]]. In the community, architectural educators may work to aid [[citizens]] or members of a [[community]] to become aware of their [[Social environment|environment]], and their role in its [[ownership]] and custodianship.

Architectural Educators are represented by national and regional associations such ACSA in the US, and the EAAE in Europe.

In some cases, architecture itself may become a tool of education, as traditionally practised by architects such as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Le Corbusier]], or as an educational heurism, as in the case of the work of a lesser known figure such as [[Anupama Kundoo]] (see below)

'''Atmospheric dispersion modeling''' is the [[computer simulation|mathematical simulation]] of how [[Air pollution|air pollutants]] disperse in the ambient [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. It is performed with computer programs that include [[algorithm]]s to solve the mathematical equations that govern the pollutant dispersion. The [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|dispersion models]] are used to estimate the downwind ambient [[concentration]] of air pollutants or toxins emitted from sources such as industrial plants, vehicular traffic or accidental chemical releases. They can also be used to predict future concentrations under specific scenarios (i.e. changes in emission sources). Therefore, they are the dominant type of model used in air quality policy making. They are most useful for pollutants that are dispersed over large distances and that may react in the atmosphere. For pollutants that have a very high spatio-temporal variability (i.e. have very steep distance to source decay such as [[black carbon]]) and for [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies statistical land-use regression models are also used.

Dispersion models are important to governmental agencies tasked with protecting and managing the ambient [[air quality]]. The models are typically employed to determine whether existing or proposed new industrial facilities are or will be in compliance with the [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] (NAAQS) in the [[United States]] and other nations. The models also serve to assist in the design of effective control strategies to reduce [[Emission standards|emissions]] of harmful air pollutants. During the late 1960s, the Air Pollution Control Office of the U.S. EPA initiated research projects that would lead to the development of models for the use by urban and transportation planners.&lt;ref&gt;Fensterstock, J.C. et al., [http://pubs.awma.org/gsearch/journal/1971/7/21_07_395.pdf "Reduction of air pollution potential through environmental planning"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, JAPCA, Vol.21, No.7, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; A major and significant application of a roadway dispersion model that resulted from such research was applied to the [[Spadina Expressway]] of Canada in 1971.

Air dispersion models are also used by public safety responders and emergency management personnel for emergency planning of accidental chemical releases. Models are used to determine the consequences of accidental releases of hazardous or toxic materials, Accidental releases may result in fires, spills or explosions that involve hazardous materials, such as chemicals or radionuclides. The results of dispersion modeling, using worst case [[accidental release source terms]] and meteorological conditions, can provide an estimate of location impacted areas, ambient concentrations, and be used to determine protective actions appropriate in the event a release occurs. Appropriate protective actions may include evacuation or [[shelter in place]] for persons in the downwind direction. At industrial facilities, this type of consequence assessment or emergency planning is required under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)]] (CAA) codified in Part 68 of Title 40 of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]].

The dispersion models vary depending on the mathematics used to develop the model, but all require the input of data that may include:
* [[Meteorology|Meteorological]] conditions such as wind speed and direction, the amount of atmospheric [[turbulence]] (as characterized by what is called the [[Air pollution dispersion terminology#Characterization of atmospheric turbulence|"stability class"]]), the ambient air temperature, the height to the bottom of any [[Temperature inversion|inversion]] aloft that may be present, cloud cover and solar radiation.
* Source term (the concentration or quantity of toxins in emission or [[accidental release source terms]]) and temperature of the material
* Emissions or release parameters such as source location and height, type of source (i.e., fire, pool or vent stack)and exit [[velocity]], exit temperature and [[mass flow rate]] or release rate.
* Terrain elevations at the source location and at the receptor location(s), such as nearby homes, schools, businesses and hospitals.
* The location, height and width of any obstructions (such as buildings or other structures) in the path of the emitted gaseous plume, surface roughness or the use of a more generic parameter "rural" or "city" terrain.

Many of the modern, advanced dispersion modeling programs include a [[Preprocessor (CAE)|pre-processor]] module for the input of meteorological and other data, and many also include a post-processor module for graphing the output data and/or [[Plot (graphics)|plotting]] the area impacted by the air pollutants on maps. The plots of areas impacted may also include [[isopleths]] showing areas of minimal to high concentrations that define areas of the highest health risk. The isopleths plots are useful in determining protective actions for the public and responders.

The atmospheric dispersion models are also known as atmospheric diffusion models, air dispersion models, air quality models, and air pollution dispersion models.

==Atmospheric layers==

Discussion of the layers in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] is needed to understand where airborne pollutants disperse in the atmosphere. The layer closest to the Earth's surface is known as the ''[[Earth's atmosphere|troposphere]]''. It extends from sea-level to a height of about 18&amp;nbsp;km and contains about 80 percent of the mass of the overall atmosphere. The ''[[Earth's atmosphere|stratosphere]]'' is the next layer and extends from 18&amp;nbsp;km to about 50&amp;nbsp;km. The third layer is the ''[[Earth's atmosphere|mesosphere]]'' which extends from 50&amp;nbsp;km to about 80&amp;nbsp;km. There are other layers above 80&amp;nbsp;km, but they are insignificant with respect to atmospheric dispersion modeling.

The lowest part of the troposphere is called the ''[[Planetary boundary layer|atmospheric boundary layer (ABL)]]'' or the ''[[Planetary boundary layer|planetary boundary layer (PBL)]]'' . The air temperature of the atmosphere decreases with increasing altitude until it reaches what is called a ''[[Capping inversion|inversion layer]]'' (where the temperature increases with increasing altitude) that caps the [[Convective Boundary Layer]], typically to about 1.5 to 2.0&amp;nbsp;km in height. The upper part of the troposphere (i.e., above the inversion layer) is called the ''free troposphere'' and it extends up to the [[tropopause]] (the boundary in the Earth's atmosphere between the troposphere and the stratosphere). In tropical and mid-latitudes during daytime, the [[Free convective layer]] can comprises the entire troposphere, which is up to 10 km to 18 km in the [[Intertropical convergence zone]].

The ABL is of the most important with respect to the emission, transport and dispersion of airborne pollutants. The part of the ABL between the Earth's surface and the bottom of the inversion layer is known as the mixing layer. Almost all of the airborne pollutants emitted into the ambient atmosphere are transported and dispersed within the mixing layer. Some of the emissions penetrate the inversion layer and enter the free troposphere above the ABL.

In summary, the layers of the Earth's atmosphere from the surface of the ground upwards are: the ABL made up of the mixing layer capped by the inversion layer; the free troposphere; the stratosphere; the mesosphere and others. Many atmospheric dispersion models are referred to as ''boundary layer models'' because they mainly model air pollutant dispersion within the ABL. To avoid confusion, models referred to as ''mesoscale models'' have dispersion modeling capabilities that extend horizontally up to a few hundred kilometres. It does not mean that they model dispersion in the mesosphere.

==Gaussian air pollutant dispersion equation==

The technical literature on air pollution dispersion is quite extensive and dates back to the 1930s and earlier. One of the early air pollutant plume dispersion equations was derived by Bosanquet and Pearson.&lt;ref&gt;Bosanquet, C.H. and Pearson, J.L., "The spread of smoke and gases from chimneys", Trans. Faraday Soc., 32:1249, 1936&lt;/ref&gt; Their equation did not assume [[Normal distribution|Gaussian distribution]] nor did it include the effect of ground reflection of the pollutant plume.

Sir Graham Sutton derived an air pollutant plume dispersion equation in 1947&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, O.G., "The problem of diffusion in the lower atmosphere", QJRMS, 73:257, 1947 and "The theoretical distribution of airborne pollution from factory chimneys", QJRMS, 73:426, 1947&lt;/ref&gt; which did include the assumption of Gaussian distribution for the vertical and crosswind dispersion of the plume and also included the effect of ground reflection of the plume.

Under the stimulus provided by the advent of stringent [[Clean Air Act (United States)|environmental control regulations]], there was an immense growth in the use of air pollutant plume dispersion calculations between the late 1960s and today. A great many computer programs for calculating the dispersion of air pollutant emissions were developed during that period of time and they were called "air dispersion models". The basis for most of those models was the '''Complete Equation For Gaussian Dispersion Modeling Of [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Continuous, Buoyant Air Pollution Plumes]]''' shown below:&lt;ref name=Beychok&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Turner, D.B.|title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling| edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=1994|isbn=1-56670-023-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above equation not only includes upward reflection from the ground, it also includes downward reflection from the bottom of any inversion lid present in the atmosphere.

The sum of the four exponential terms in &lt;math&gt;g_3&lt;/math&gt; converges to a final value quite rapidly. For most cases, the summation of the series with ''m'' = 1, ''m'' = 2 and ''m'' = 3 will provide an adequate solution.

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_y&lt;/math&gt; are functions of the atmospheric stability class (i.e., a measure of the turbulence in the ambient atmosphere) and of the downwind distance to the receptor. The two most important variables affecting the degree of pollutant emission dispersion obtained are the height of the emission source point and the degree of atmospheric turbulence. The more turbulence, the better the degree of dispersion.

The classification of stability class is proposed by F. Pasquill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=W|first1=Klug|title=Atmospheric Diffusion (3rd Edition). F. Pasquill and F. B. Smith. Ellis Horwood, (John Wiley &amp; Sons) Chichester, 1983|date=April 1984|publisher=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society|location=New York|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six stability classes are referred to:
A-extremely unstable
B-moderately unstable
C-slightly unstable
D-neutral
E-slightly stable
F-moderately stable

The resulting calculations for [[air pollutant concentrations]] are often expressed as an [[air pollutant]] concentration [[contour line|contour map]] in order to show the spatial variation in contaminant levels over a wide area under study.  In this way the contour lines can overlay sensitive receptor locations and reveal the spatial relationship of air pollutants to areas of interest.

Whereas older models rely on stability classes (see [[air pollution dispersion terminology]]) for the determination of &lt;math&gt;\sigma_y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_z&lt;/math&gt;, more recent models increasingly rely on the [[Monin-Obukhov length|Monin-Obukhov similarity theory]] to derive these parameters.

==Briggs plume rise equations==

The Gaussian air pollutant dispersion equation (discussed above) requires the input of ''H'' which is the pollutant plume's centerline height above ground level—and H
is the sum of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (the actual physical height of the pollutant plume's emission source point) plus Δ''H'' (the plume rise due the plume's buoyancy).

[[File:Gaussian Plume (SVG).svg|thumb|right|333px|Visualization of a buoyant Gaussian air pollutant dispersion plume]]

To determine Δ''H'', many if not most of the air dispersion models developed between the late 1960s and the early 2000s used what are known as "the Briggs equations." G.A. Briggs first published his plume rise observations and comparisons in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, G.A., "A plume rise model compared with observations", JAPCA, 15:433–438, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, at a symposium sponsored by CONCAWE (a Dutch organization), he compared many of the plume rise models then available in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, G.A., "CONCAWE meeting: discussion of the comparative consequences of different plume rise formulas", Atmos. Envir., 2:228–232, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, Briggs also wrote the section of the publication edited by Slade&lt;ref&gt;Slade, D.H. (editor), "Meteorology and atomic energy 1968", Air Resources Laboratory, U.S. Dept. of Commerce, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; dealing with the comparative analyses of plume rise models.  That was followed in 1969 by his classical critical review of the entire plume rise literature,&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, G.A., "Plume Rise", USAEC Critical Review Series, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; in which he proposed a set of plume rise equations which have become widely known as "the Briggs equations".  Subsequently, Briggs modified his 1969 plume rise equations in 1971 and in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, G.A., "Some recent analyses of plume rise observation", Proc. Second Internat'l. Clean Air Congress, Academic Press, New York, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, G.A., "Discussion: chimney plumes in neutral and stable surroundings", Atmos. Envir., 6:507–510, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

Briggs divided air pollution plumes into these four general categories:
* Cold jet plumes in calm ambient air conditions
* Cold jet plumes in windy ambient air conditions
* Hot, buoyant plumes in calm ambient air conditions
* Hot, buoyant plumes in windy ambient air conditions

Briggs considered the trajectory of cold jet plumes to be dominated by their initial velocity momentum, and the trajectory of hot, buoyant plumes to be dominated by their buoyant momentum to the extent that their initial velocity momentum was relatively unimportant.  Although Briggs proposed plume rise equations for each of the above plume categories, '''''it is important to emphasize that "the Briggs equations" which become widely used are those that he proposed for bent-over, hot buoyant plumes'''''.

In general, Briggs's equations for bent-over, hot buoyant plumes are based on observations and data involving plumes from typical combustion sources such as the [[Flue gas|flue gas stacks]] from steam-generating boilers burning [[fossil fuel]]s in large power plants.  Therefore, the stack exit velocities were probably in the range of 20 to 100&amp;nbsp;ft/s (6 to 30&amp;nbsp;m/s) with exit temperatures ranging from 250 to 500&amp;nbsp;°F (120 to 260&amp;nbsp;°C).

A logic diagram for using the Briggs equations&lt;ref name=Beychok/&gt; to obtain the plume rise trajectory of bent-over buoyant plumes is presented below:

{{coord|-34.902|138.582|type:landmark_region:AU|format=dms|display=title}}
The '''Bowden development''' is an urban development in the Australian state of [[South Australia]] on a site formerly owned by the [[Clipsal]] corporation in the suburb of [[Bowden, South Australia|Bowden]], within the [[City of Charles Sturt]], in the [[Adelaide|Adelaide metropolitan area]] 2.5 kilometres from the city centre. 

The site covers an area of {{convert|10.25|ha}} and is bounded by Park Terrace to the south, the [[Outer Harbor railway line]] to the west, Drayton Street to the north and Sixth and Seventh Streets to the east. The Government also acquired the adjoining 5.9-hectare site which had been owned by Origin Energy (known as the Brompton Gasworks site). Currently the overall Bowden development site is 16.3 hectares.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/about/progress/&lt;/ref&gt;

The development is expected to be completed by 2020 to 2025. The development is expected to increase the population of Bowden, which was 648 in the 2006 census, to 3,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Census 2006 AUS|id=SSC41161|name=Bowden (State Suburb)|accessdate=2008-06-07| quick=on}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sustainability initiatives==

The Bowden development is leading the way with many groundbreaking initiatives including energy reduction through passive and active measures for buildings. [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]] is a world's best practice rating tool from the [[Green Building Council of Australia]] covering a broad range of well-tested sustainability issues.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Developer-Green-Star-Fact-Sheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Each and every building delivered in the development must achieve a minimum 5 Star Green Star rating&lt;ref&gt;http://new.gbca.org.au/showcase/projects/bowden-development/&lt;/ref&gt; including commercial buildings such as '''Plant 4 Bowden'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://new.gbca.org.au/showcase/projects/plant-4-bowden/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Bowden development raised the bar and achieved its 6 Star Green Star - Communities accreditation; and with the highest concentration of Green Star homes in Australia, it is one of the most environmentally sustainable communities in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/new-town-square-opens-bowden-celebrates-sustainability-achievement/&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same year, the Prince's Terraces Adelaide in Bowden became the first residential project to receive 6 Star Green Star design rating from the [[Green Building Council of Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;http://new.gbca.org.au/showcase/projects/princes-terrace-adelaide/&lt;/ref&gt;, encapsulating innovation and world leadership in sustainable design.

==History==
[[File:Bowden clipsal.JPG|thumb|250x250px|The Clipsal factory in Bowden in the foreground]] 
The Bowden site was occupied by Clipsal, a company manufacturing conduit and electrical accessories, in 1936. The opportunity for an urban development on the site grew out of the [[Government of South Australia|South Australian Government]]'s plans for eleven [[transport-oriented development]]s in the Adelaide metropolitan area, combined with Clipsal's decision that the Bowden site is surplus to company requirements and plan to vacate. The site was originally offered for sale in early 2008 with offers to be received by July 2008. Offers in the realm of 75 to 80 million Australian dollars were expected however evidently not attained; as the [[2008 economic crisis]] accelerated and falling property prices diminished the likelihood of a sale at expected prices, the South Australian government intervened and announced in October 2008 that it would purchase the site. It was revealed in November 2008 the government had agreed to pay A$52.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id%3D3956%26print%3D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206075532/http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id=3956 |archivedate=2008-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==

===2008–2010===

In late 2008, the State Government acquired a 10.25ha parcel of land owned by Gerard Industries (known as the Clipsal site). In early 2010, the government acquired the adjoining 5.9ha site owned by Origin Energy (known as the Brompton Gasworks site).

Both sites are located within the [[City of Charles Sturt]] and are directly adjacent to the Adelaide parklands. The aim is to transform the combined sites into an inner-city, higher intensity, mixed use urban village. The final vision developed collaboratively with the community and stakeholders states: “Bowden Urban Village is a creative and diverse community, living and working in a high density sustainable urban environment. Its character, parklands connections and  integrated urban design will offer a new and distinctive place in Adelaide for residents and visitors.”&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Bowden-Developers-Handbook-Urban-Design-Guidelines-Jan-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Australian Government anticipates that the site will be used to develop more than 2,400 residential apartments and terrace homes, in addition to retail outlets and commercial offices around a town centre.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Bowden-Developers-Handbook-Urban-Design-Guidelines-Jan-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The South Australian Government is promoting the plan as an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independentweekly.com.au/news/local/news/general/housing-for-clipsal-site/1342897.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Bowden is served by [[Bowden railway station]], [[North Adelaide railway station]], buses on Hawker Street and Port Road, and the tram from the nearby [[Adelaide Entertainment Centre]] on Port Road, Hindmarsh.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com.au/maps/@-34.9043904,138.5777874,17z?hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Prince Charles visits Bowden SA.jpg|left|thumb|190x190px|Prince Charles launched the Prince's Terraces in Bowden]]

===2011–2015===

In April 2011, the plans for the development were approved &lt;ref name="approval"&gt;[http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/bowden-tod-gets-the-nod/story-e6frea83-1226043678620 Adelaide Now].&lt;/ref&gt; and an information and sales centre opened in March 2012.

Following demolition, site cleanup, surveying, planning and approval, remediation and development are underway. Bowden’s first pedestrian and bicycle-friendly streets — Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and part of Gibson Streets — opened to the public in May 2013.

In 2014, the restaurant '''Jarmer's Kitchen''' opened&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/jarmers-kitchen-bowden/&lt;/ref&gt;, and the Bowden development's first residents moved in&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/first-residents-now-call-bowden-home/&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2015, His Royal Highness Prince [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] officially launched the construction of Australia's first 6 Star [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]] residential project, the '''Prince's Terraces Adelaide''' which is predicted to use 50% less energy and 50% less potable water than a typical urban townhouse, with a carbon footprint also reduced by more than 40% when compared to a standard house.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/princes-terrace-adelaide-breaking-ground/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bowden Town Square opening in 2016.jpg|thumb|190x190px|Bowden Town Square opening community celebration]]

===2016-2017===

The community celebrated the completion of a major upgrade to the [[Adelaide Park Lands]] across the road from Bowden in February 2016&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/time-celebrate-bowdens-new-front-yard/&lt;/ref&gt; where the '''Park Terrace Community Garden''' currently resides.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/bowden-life/community-garden/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bowden development achieved its sustainability milestone with a 6 Star [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]] - Communities rating in October 2016, and hosted its biggest celebration ever to mark the opening of Bowden Town Square consisting '''Bowden Park''', the '''Plant 4 Bowden''' retail hub and '''Plant 3''' community hub.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/new-town-square-opens-bowden-celebrates-sustainability-achievement/&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2017, 500 new homes were sold.&lt;ref&gt;https://lifemoreinteresting.com.au/happenings/latest-news/bowden-moving-forward-500-homes-sold-new-developers-block/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Brewing Justice: Fair Trade Coffee, Sustainability and Survival''''' is a [[book]] by American academic Daniel Jaffee.

The book, by studying [[coffee]] farmers in Mexico, offers an investigation of the social, economic, and environmental benefits of [[fair trade]]. Based on research in [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] indigenous communities in the state of Oaxaca, Brewing Justice follows the members of the cooperative Michiza, whose organic coffee is sold on the international fair trade market. It compares these families to conventional farming families in the same region, who depend on local middlemen and are vulnerable to the fluctuations of the world coffee market.

The book carries readers into the lives of these coffee producer households and their communities, offering a nuanced analysis of both the effects of fair trade on everyday life and the limits of its impact. Brewing Justice paints a clear picture of the complex dynamics of the fair trade market and its relationship to the global economy. Drawing on interviews with dozens of fair trade leaders, the book also explores the changing politics of this international movement, including the challenges posed by the entry of transnational corporations into the fair trade system. It concludes by offering recommendations for strengthening and protecting the integrity of fair trade.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="990">'''Collaborative engineering''' is defined by the [[International Journal of Collaborative Engineering]] as a discipline that "studies the interactive process of engineering collaboration, whereby multiple interested [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] resolve conflicts, bargain for individual or collective advantages, agree upon courses of action, and/or attempt to craft joint outcomes which serve their mutual interests."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inderscience.com/browse/index.php?journalID=161 International Journal of Collaborative Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative engineering is quickly becoming a topic of great interest in recent years due to the explosion of internet technologies. This upsurge is partially due to the success of projects such as [[Wikipedia]] and [[Linux]] that have proven the efficacy of internet collaboration.

The word '''decadence''', which at first meant simply "decline" in an abstract sense, is now most often used to refer to a perceived decay in standards, morals, dignity, religious faith, or skill at governing among the members of the elite of a very large social structure, such as an empire or nation state. By extension, it may refer to a decline in art, literature, science, technology, and work ethics, or (very loosely) to self-indulgent behavior.

Usage of the term sometimes implies moral censure, or an acceptance of the idea, met with throughout the world since ancient times, that such declines are objectively observable and that they inevitably precede the destruction of the society in question; for this reason, modern historians use it with caution. The word originated in Medieval Latin ''(dēcadentia)'', appeared in 16th-century French, and entered English soon afterwards. It bore the neutral meaning of decay, decrease, or decline until the late 19th century, when the influence of new theories of [[social degeneration]] contributed to its modern meaning.

In literature, the [[Decadent movement]]—late nineteenth century ''[[fin de siècle]]'' writers who were associated with [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] or the [[Aesthetic movement]]—was first given its name by hostile critics. Later it was triumphantly adopted by some of the writers themselves. The Decadents praised artifice over nature and sophistication over simplicity, defying contemporary discourses of decline by embracing subjects and styles that their critics considered morbid and over-refined. Some of these writers were influenced by the tradition of the [[Gothic novel]] and by the poetry and fiction of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].

==History==
===Decadent movement===
{{Main|Decadent movement}}
[[File:Félicien Rops - Pornokratès - 1878.jpg|thumb|''[[Pornocrates]]'' by [[Félicien Rops]] (1878)]]
Decadence was the name given to a number of late nineteenth-century writers who valued artifice over the earlier Romantics' naïve view of nature. Some of them triumphantly adopted the name, referring to themselves as Decadents. For the most part, they were influenced by the tradition of the [[Gothic novel]] and by the poetry and fiction of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and were associated with [[symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and/or [[Aestheticism]].

This concept of decadence dates from the eighteenth century, especially from [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], and was taken up by critics as a term of abuse after [[Désiré Nisard]] used it against [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Romanticism]] in general. A later generation of Romantics, such as [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]] took the word as a badge of pride, as a sign of their rejection of what they saw as banal "progress." In the 1880s, a group of [[French literature|French writers]] referred to themselves as Decadents. The classic [[novel]] from this group is [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]' ''[[À rebours|Against Nature]]'', often seen as the first great decadent work, though others attribute this honor to Baudelaire's works.

In Britain and Ireland the leading figure associated with the Decadent movement was Irish writer, [[Oscar Wilde]]. Other significant figures include Arthur Symons, Aubrey Beardsley and Ernest Dowson.

The Symbolist movement has frequently been confused with the Decadent movement. Several young writers were derisively referred to in the press as "decadent" in the mid-1880s. [[Jean Moréas]]' manifesto was largely a response to this [[polemic]]. A few of these writers embraced the term while most avoided it. Although the aesthetics of Symbolism and Decadence can be seen as overlapping in some areas, the two remain distinct.

===1920s Berlin===
{{main|1920s Berlin}}

This "''fertile culture''" of Berlin extended onwards until [[Adolf Hitler]] rose to power in early 1933 and stamped out any and all resistance to the [[Nazi Party]]. Likewise, the Nazis decried Berlin as a haven of vice.{{Clarify|date=April 2008}} A new [[culture]] developed in and around Berlin, including architecture and design ([[Bauhaus]], 1919–33), a variety of literature ([[Alfred Döblin|Döblin]], ''[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]'', 1929), film ([[Fritz Lang|Lang]], ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', 1927, [[Marlene Dietrich|Dietrich]], ''[[Der blaue Engel]]'', 1930), painting ([[George Grosz|Grosz]]), and music ([[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]] and [[Kurt Weill|Weill]], ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', 1928), criticism ([[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]]), philosophy/psychology ([[Carl Jung|Jung]]), and fashion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} This culture was often considered to be decadent, and socially, morally, destructive.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkus UK review of Laqueur, Walter ''Weimar: A cultural history, 1918-1933''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cinema of Germany|Film]] was making huge technical and artistic strides during this period of time in Berlin, and gave rise to the influential movement called [[German Expressionism]]. "[[Talkies]]", the Sound films, were also becoming more popular with the general public across Europe, and Berlin was producing very many of them.

Berlin in the 20s also proved to be a haven for English writers such as [[W. H. Auden]], [[Stephen Spender]] and [[Christopher Isherwood]], who wrote a series of 'Berlin novels', inspiring the play ''[[I Am a Camera]]'', which was later adapted into a musical, ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', and an [[Academy Award]] winning [[Cabaret (1972 film)|film of the same name]]. Spender's semi-autobiographical novel ''[[The Temple (Stephen Spender)|The Temple]]'' evokes the attitude and atmosphere of the place at the time.

==Use in Marxism==
===Leninism===
According to [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[capitalism]] had reached its highest stage and could no longer provide for the general development of society. He expected reduced vigor in economic activity and a growth in unhealthy economic phenomena, reflecting capitalism's gradually decreasing capacity to provide for social needs and preparing the ground for [[socialist]] revolution in the [[Western world|West]].  Politically, [[World War I]] proved the decadent nature of the advanced capitalist countries to Lenin, that [[capitalism]] had reached the stage where it would destroy its own prior achievements more than it would advance.&lt;ref name=libcom&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/decadence-aufheben-2 Decadence: The Theory of Decline or the Decline of Theory? (Part I)]. ''[[Aufheben]]''. Summer 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

One who directly opposed the idea of decadence as expressed by Lenin was [[José Ortega y Gasset]] in ''[[The Revolt of the Masses]]'' (1930). He argued that the "[[mass man]]" had the notion of material progress and scientific advance deeply inculcated to the extent that it was an expectation.  He also argued that contemporary progress was opposite the true decadence of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Mora, José Ferrater (1956). ''Ortega y Gasset: an outline of his philosophy.'' Bowes &amp; Bowes. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Left communism===
Decadence is an important aspect of contemporary left [[Communism|communist]] theory. Similar to Lenin's use of it, left communists, coming from the Communist International themselves started in fact with a theory of decadence in the first place, yet the communist left sees the theory of decadence at the heart of [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] method as well, expressed in famous works such as ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', ''[[Grundrisse]]'', ''[[Das Kapital]]'' but most significantly in ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy|Preface to the Critique of Political Economy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl (1859). ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy.''  Progress Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary left communist theory defends that Lenin was mistaken on his definition of imperialism (although how grave his mistake was and how much of his work on imperialism is valid varies from groups to groups) and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] to be basically correct on this question, thus accepting capitalism as a world epoch similarly to Lenin, but a world epoch from which no capitalist state can oppose or avoid being a part of. On the other hand, the theoretical framework of capitalism's decadence varies between different groups while left communist organizations like the [[International Communist Current]] hold a basically [[Luxemburgist]] analysis that makes an emphasis on the world market and its expansion, others hold views more in line with those of [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and most importantly [[Henryk Grossman]] and [[Paul Mattick]] with an emphasis on monopolies and the falling [[rate of profit]].

Orri, "Decision Theory", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/decision-theory]&lt;/ref&gt; Decision theory can be broken into two branches: [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] decision theory, which gives advice on how to make the [[optimal decision|best decisions]], given a set of uncertain beliefs and a set of [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]; and descriptive decision theory, which analyzes how existing, possibly irrational agents actually make decisions.

Closely related to the field of [[game theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Myerson|first1=Roger B.|title=Game theory analysis of conflict|date=1991|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674728615|chapter=1.2: Basic concepts of Decision Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; decision theory is concerned with the choices of individual agents whereas game theory is concerned with interactions of agents whose decisions affect each other. Decision theory is an interdisciplinary topic, studied by economists,
statisticians, psychologists, biologists,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Habibi|first=Iman|last2=Cheong|first2=Raymond|last3=Lipniacki|first3=Tomasz|last4=Levchenko|first4=Andre|last5=Emamian|first5=Effat S.|last6=Abdi|first6=Ali|date=2017-04-05|title=Computation and measurement of cell decision making errors using single cell data|url=http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005436|journal=PLOS Computational Biology|volume=13|issue=4|pages=e1005436|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005436|issn=1553-7358}}&lt;/ref&gt; political and other social scientists, philosophers,&lt;ref&gt;Hansson, Sven Ove. "Decision theory: A brief introduction." (2005) Section 1.2: A truly interdisciplinary subject.&lt;/ref&gt; and computer scientists.

Empirical applications of this rich theory are usually done with the help of [[statistics|statistical]] and [[econometrics|econometric]] methods, especially via the so-called choice models, such as [[probit]] and [[logit]] models. Estimation of such models is usually done via parametric, semi-parametric and non-parametric [[maximum likelihood]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167947316302596 | doi=10.1016/j.csda.2016.10.024 | volume=108 | title=Nonparametric estimation of dynamic discrete choice models for time series data | year=2017 | journal=Computational Statistics &amp; Data Analysis | pages=97–120 | last1 = Park | first1 = Byeong U. | last2 = Simar | first2 = Léopold | last3 = Zelenyuk | first3 = Valentin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Normative and descriptive==
[[Normative]] decision theory is concerned with identifying the best decision to make, modelling an ideal decision maker who is able to compute with perfect accuracy and is fully [[rationality|rational]]. The practical application of this prescriptive approach (how people ''ought to'' make decisions) is called [[decision analysis]], and is aimed at finding tools, methodologies and software ([[decision support system]]s) to help people make better decisions.

In contrast, [[Positive statement|positive]] or descriptive decision theory is concerned with describing observed behaviors under the assumption that the decision-making agents are behaving under some consistent rules. These rules may, for instance, have a procedural framework (e.g. [[Amos Tversky]]'s elimination by aspects model) or an [[axiom]]atic framework, reconciling the [[Expected utility hypothesis#Von Neumann|Von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms]] with behavioral violations of the [[expected utility]] hypothesis, or they may explicitly give a functional form for [[time inconsistency|time-inconsistent]] [[utility function]]s (e.g. Laibson's [[Hyperbolic discounting|quasi-hyperbolic discounting]]).

The prescriptions or predictions about behaviour that positive decision theory produces allow for further tests of the kind of decision-making that occurs in practice. There is a thriving dialogue with [[experimental economics]], which uses laboratory and field experiments to evaluate and inform theory. In recent decades, there has also been increasing interest in what is sometimes called "behavioral decision theory" and this has contributed to a re-evaluation of what rational decision-making requires.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, see: {{cite book |author=Anand, Paul |title=Foundations of Rational Choice Under Risk |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1993 |isbn=0-19-823303-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==What kinds of decisions need a theory?==

===Choice under uncertainty=== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Risk]] --&gt;
{{Details|Expected utility hypothesis}}
The area of choice under uncertainty represents the heart of decision theory. Known from the 17th century ([[Blaise Pascal]] invoked it in his [[Pascal's Wager|famous wager]], which is contained in his ''[[Pensées]]'', published in 1670), the idea of [[expected value]] is that, when faced with a number of actions, each of which could give rise to more than one possible outcome with different probabilities, the rational procedure is to identify all possible outcomes, determine their values (positive or negative) and the probabilities that will result from each course of action, and multiply the two to give an "expected value", or the average expectation for an outcome; the action to be chosen should be the one that gives rise to the highest total expected value.  In 1738, [[Daniel Bernoulli]] published an influential paper entitled ''Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk'', in which he uses the [[St. Petersburg paradox]] to show that expected value theory must be [[Norm (philosophy)|normatively]] wrong. He gives an example in which a Dutch merchant is trying to decide whether to insure a cargo being sent from Amsterdam to St Petersburg in winter. In his solution, he defines a [[utility function]] and computes [[expected utility]] rather than expected financial value (see&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schoemaker|first=P. J. H.|title=The Expected Utility Model: Its Variants, Purposes, Evidence and Limitations|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=20|year=1982|pages=529–563}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a review).

In the 20th century, interest was reignited by [[Abraham Wald|Abraham Wald's]] 1939 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |title=Contributions to the Theory of Statistical Estimation and Testing Hypotheses
 |last=Wald |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Wald
 |journal=[[Annals of Mathematical Statistics]]
 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=299–326 |year=1939
 |doi=10.1214/aoms/1177732144
 |mr=932
}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out that the two central procedures of [[frequentist statistics|sampling-distribution-based]] statistical-theory, namely [[statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis testing]] and [[estimation theory|parameter estimation]], are special cases of the general decision problem.  Wald's paper renewed and synthesized many concepts of statistical theory, including [[loss function]]s, [[risk function]]s, [[admissible decision rule]]s, [[prior probability|antecedent distributions]], [[admissible decision rule#Bayes rules|Bayesian procedures]], and [[minimax]] procedures.  The phrase "decision theory" itself was used in 1950 by [[E. L. Lehmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lehmann|first=E. L.|authorlink=E. L. Lehmann|title=Some Principles of the Theory of Testing Hypotheses|journal=[[Annals of Mathematical Statistics]]|year=1950|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–26|jstor=2236552|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177729884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revival of [[subjective probability]] theory, from the work of [[Frank P. Ramsey|Frank Ramsey]], [[Bruno de Finetti]], [[L. J. Savage|Leonard Savage]] and others, extended the scope of expected utility theory to situations where subjective probabilities can be used. At the time, von Neumann and Morgenstern’s theory of [[expected utility]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (Third ed.)|last=Neumann|first=John von|last2=Morgenstern|first2=Oskar|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1953 |origyear=1944|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved that expected utility maximization followed from basic postulates about rational behavior.

The work of [[Maurice Allais]] and [[Daniel Ellsberg]] showed that human behavior has systematic and sometimes important departures from expected-utility maximization. The [[prospect theory]] of [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]] renewed the empirical study of [[behavioral economics|economic behavior]] with less emphasis on rationality presuppositions. Kahneman and Tversky found three regularities – in actual human decision-making, "losses loom larger than gains"; persons focus more on ''changes'' in their utility-states than they focus on absolute utilities; and the estimation of subjective probabilities is severely biased by [[anchoring]].

===Intertemporal choice===
{{Main|Intertemporal choice}}
Intertemporal choice is concerned with the kind of choice where different actions lead to outcomes that are realised at different points in time.  If someone received a windfall of several thousand dollars, they could spend it on an expensive holiday, giving them immediate pleasure, or they could invest it in a pension scheme, giving them an income at some time in the future.  What is the optimal thing to do?  The answer depends partly on factors such as the expected [[interest rate|rates of interest]] and [[inflation]], the person's [[life expectancy]], and their confidence in the pensions industry.  However even with all those factors taken into account, human behavior again deviates greatly from the predictions of prescriptive decision theory, leading to alternative models in which, for example, objective interest rates are replaced by [[hyperbolic discounting|subjective discount rates]].

===Interaction of decision makers===
Some decisions are difficult because of the need to take into account how other people in the situation will respond to the decision that is taken.  The analysis of such social decisions is more often treated under the label of [[game theory]], rather than decision theory, though it involves the same mathematical methods. From the standpoint of game theory most of the problems treated in decision theory are one-player games (or the one player is viewed as playing against an impersonal background situation). In the emerging field of [[socio-cognitive]] engineering, the research is especially focused on the different types of distributed decision-making in human organizations, in normal and abnormal/emergency/crisis situations.&lt;ref&gt;Crozier, M. &amp; Friedberg, E. 1995. "Organization and Collective Action. Our Contribution to Organizational Analysis" in Bacharach S.B, Gagliardi P. &amp; Mundell P. (Eds). Research in the Sociology of Organizations. Vol. XIII, Special Issue on European Perspectives of Organizational Theory, Greenwich, CT: JAI Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complex decisions===
Other areas of decision theory are concerned with decisions that are difficult simply because of their complexity, or the complexity of the organization that has to make them. Individuals making decisions may be limited in resources or are [[Bounded rationality|boundedly rational]] (have finite time or intelligence); in such cases the issue, more than the deviation between real and optimal behaviour, is the difficulty of determining the optimal behaviour in the first place. One example is the model of economic growth and resource usage developed by the [[Club of Rome]] to help politicians make real-life decisions in complex situations{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. Decisions are also affected by whether options are framed together or separately; this is known as the [[distinction bias]].  In 2011, Dwayne Rosenburgh explored and showed how decision theory can be applied to complex decisions that arise in areas such as [[wireless communications]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenburgh, D. 2011. "Decision Theory with its Applications in Wireless Communication" in Zhang, Y. (Ed.), GUIZANI, M. (Ed.). (2011). Game Theory for Wireless Communications and Networking. Boca Raton: CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heuristics==
{{Main|Heuristic}}

The heuristic approach to decision-making makes decisions based on routine thinking, which, while quicker than step-by-step processing, opens the risk of introducing inaccuracies, mistakes and fallacies, which may be easily disproved in a step-by-step process of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Payne | first2 = J. W. | year = 1985 | title = EFFORT AND ACCURACY IN CHOICE | url = | journal = Management Science | volume = 31 | issue = 4| pages = 395–414 | doi=10.1287/mnsc.31.4.395}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One example of common and incorrect thought process is the [[gambler's fallacy]], or believing that a random event is affected by previous random events (truth is, there is a fifty percent chance of a coin landing on heads even after a long sequence of tails).  Another example is that decision-makers may be biased towards preferring moderate alternatives to extreme ones; the "Compromise Effect" operates under a mindset driven by the belief that the most moderate option, amid extremes, carries the most benefits from each extreme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roe | first1 = R. M. | last2 = Busemeyer | first2 = J. R. | last3 = Townsend | first3 = J. T. | year = 2001 | title = Multialternative decision field theory: A dynamic connectionist model of decision making | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 108 | issue = 2| pages = 370–392 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.108.2.370 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
A highly controversial issue is whether one can replace the use of probability in decision theory by other alternatives.

===Probability theory===
Advocates for the use of probability theory point to:
*   the work of [[Richard Threlkeld Cox]] for justification of the probability axioms,
*   the [[Dutch book]] paradoxes of [[Bruno de Finetti]] as illustrative of the theoretical difficulties that can arise from departures from the probability axioms, and
*   the complete class theorems, which show that all [[admissible decision rule]]s are equivalent to the Bayesian decision rule for some utility function and some [[prior distribution]] (or for the limit of a sequence of prior distributions). Thus, for every decision rule, either the rule may be reformulated as a [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] procedure (or a limit of a sequence of such), or there is a rule that is sometimes better and never worse.

===Alternatives to probability theory===
The proponents of [[fuzzy logic]], [[possibility theory]], [[quantum cognition]], [[Dempster–Shafer theory]], and [[info-gap decision theory]] maintain that probability is only one of many alternatives and point to many examples where non-standard alternatives have been implemented with apparent success; notably, probabilistic decision theory is [[sensitivity analysis|sensitive]] to assumptions about the probabilities of various events, while non-probabilistic rules such as [[minimax]] are [[robust statistics|robust]], in that they do not make such assumptions.

===Ludic fallacy===
{{Main|Ludic fallacy}}

A general criticism of decision theory based on a fixed universe of possibilities is that it considers the "known unknowns", not the "[[unknown unknowns]]"{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}: it focuses on expected variations, not on unforeseen events, which some argue (as in [[black swan theory]]) have outsized impact and must be considered – significant events may be "outside model". This line of argument, called the [[ludic fallacy]], is that there are inevitable imperfections in modeling the real world by particular models, and that unquestioning reliance on models blinds one to their limits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5873">'''Digital classics''' is the application of the tools of [[digital humanities]] to the field of [[classics]], or more broadly to the study of the [[ancient world]].

==History==

Classics was one of the first of the humanities disciplines to adopt computing approaches; the first references to the use of computing in the classical humanities date to the early 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;Arguably, the first references to the use of computing to study a text in a classical language are to a project at IBM to create a computer generated concordance of Aquinas beginning in 1949; for this, see Theodore F. Brunner, "Classics and the Computer: The History of a Relationship," in ''Accessing Antiquity: The Computerization of Classical Studies'' (1993), ed. Jon Solomon, Tucson: U. Arizona Press, for a general introduction to the early history of computing in the classical humanities.&lt;/ref&gt; which might be surprising considering the reputation of the discipline as old-fashioned and stuffily traditionalist.&lt;ref&gt;See also: Busa, Roberto. (1980). ‘The Annals of Humanities Computing: The Index Thomisticus’, in ''Computers and the Humanities'' 14:83-90. The ''[http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/it/ Index Thomisticus]'' is arguably the first humanities computing project and this seminal article deals specifically with the digitisation of this Latin text as well as reflecting on the nature and purpose of this field of scholarship.&lt;/ref&gt; Major projects such as the [[Thesaurus Linguae Graecae]], founded in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. http://www.tlg.uci.edu/about/history.php for the history of this project&lt;/ref&gt; and the text collections of the [[Packard Humanities Institute]] set the trend, and there are still a significantly large number of ancient world projects among Humanities Computing projects today.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the projects listed at http://www.kcl.ac.uk/cch/research/projects.html or http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/iathrails/projects/homepage&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the success of traditional scholarly publications in digital guises, such as seen in the ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'',&lt;ref&gt;See http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/about.html for information on the history and scope of this publication&lt;/ref&gt; and the early adoption of hypertext in high profile projects like the Perseus Digital Library&lt;ref&gt;The Perseus Project was originally published on the HyperCard platform in 1990 — around the time of the invention of the World Wide Web; see archival versions of the Perseus 1.0 documentation, http://vanth.perseus.tufts.edu/Help/P1/Doc1.info.html and the Platform-Independent Perseus documentation, http://vanth.perseus.tufts.edu/Help/PIP2/Goals_Help.html, Mylonas, "The Perseus Project," http://xml.coverpages.org/mylonasPerseus.html, and Mylonas, Crane, Morrell, and Smith, "The Perseus Project: Data in the Electronic Age" in Solomon, ''Accessing Antiquity'' ''op. cit.'' for information toward a history of Perseus' use of hypertext platforms and other information infrastructures.&lt;/ref&gt; helped to legitimize computing in the study of classics in ways that has not always been the case in other areas of the humanities.

This apparent paradox may be as a result of the many methodologies and different sources of evidence that classicists have always had to embrace, from literary sources and linguistics, to art history and archaeology, history, philosophy, religious theory, ancient documents such as [[epigraphy|inscriptions]] and [[papyrology|papyri]], and so forth. The fragmentary nature of many of the texts and languages of the ancient world, the scattered evidence from the material culture of ancient Greece and Rome, and the necessity to evaluate all these varieties of evidence in context are particularly likely to benefit from digital approaches such as databases, text markup, and image manipulation.

==Digital classics projects==
There are currently several major projects that aim to encourage and develop digital approaches to classical scholarship. The Stoa Consortium at the [[University of Kentucky]] distributes news of the discipline, and serves as a peer-reviewed electronic publication venue, and encourages [[open source]] approaches to digital classics. The [[Perseus Project]] is a digital library that also provides a collection of digital texts and analysis tools to the public; principally (but not exclusively) classical.  [[Digital Classicist]] at [[King's College London]] is another project and community which shares information and advice about the [[digital humanities]] applied to the field of classics.&lt;ref&gt;See http://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/Main_Page&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liverpool Classics Mailing List is a project which can be subscribed to in which one receives email regarding Classics events around the world, as well as call for papers, studentships and public lectures.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.lsoft.com/scripts/wl.exe?SL1=CLASSICISTS&amp;H=LISTSERV.LIV.AC.UK for details&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intersex]] people are born with [[sex characteristics]], such as [[chromosome]]s, [[gonad]]s, or [[genital]]s that, according to the UN [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], "do not fit typical binary notions of [[male]] or [[female]] bodies".&lt;ref name="unfe-fact"&gt;{{Cite web | author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | publisher = United Nations [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | title = Free &amp; Equal Campaign Fact Sheet: Intersex | date = 2015 | url = https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf | access-date = 28 March 2016 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071043/https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf | archivedate = 4 March 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Because their bodies are seen as different, intersex children and adults are often stigmatized and subjected to multiple human rights violations".&lt;ref name="unfe-fact" /&gt;

[[United Nations]], [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]], [[Council of Europe]], [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]], and other human rights institutions, have called for countries to ban discrimination and combat stigma.&lt;ref name="un-2016" /&gt; Few countries so far protect intersex people from discrimination or provide access to reparations for harmful practices.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt;

A 2013 first international pilot study. [[Human Rights between the Sexes]], by [[Dan Christian Ghattas]], found that intersex people are discriminated against worldwide: "Intersex individuals are considered individuals with a «disorder» in all areas in which Western medicine prevails. They are more or less obviously treated as sick or «abnormal», depending on the respective society."&lt;ref name="ghattas"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/endf_human_rights_between_the_sexes.pdf | title = Human Rights Between the Sexes | first1 = Dan Christian | last1 = Ghattas | authorlink1 = Dan Christian Ghattas | last2 = [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]] | date = September 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923223221/http://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/endf_human_rights_between_the_sexes.pdf | archivedate = 2015-09-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oiieurope.org/a-preliminary-study-on-the-life-situations-of-inter-individuals/ | title = A preliminary study on the life situations of inter* individuals | work = [[OII Europe]] | date = 4 November 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150704015158/http://oiieurope.org/a-preliminary-study-on-the-life-situations-of-inter-individuals/ | archivedate = 4 July 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations states that intersex people suffer stigma on the basis of physical characteristics, "including violations of their rights to health and physical integrity, to be free from torture and ill-treatment, and to equality and non- discrimination."&lt;ref name="unfe-fact" /&gt; The UN has called for governments to end discrimination against intersex people:
{{quotation|Ban discrimination on the basis of sex characteristics, intersex traits or status, including in education, health care, employment, sports and access to public services, and consult intersex people and organizations when developing legislation and policies that impact their rights.&lt;ref name="unfe-2016"&gt;{{cite web | title = United Nations for Intersex Awareness | url = https://www.unfe.org/intersex-awareness/ | last = Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights | authorlink = Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights | accessdate = 2016-11-12 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161112212215/https://www.unfe.org/intersex-awareness/ | archivedate = 2016-11-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A handful of jurisdictions so far provide explicit protection from discrimination for intersex people. [[Intersex rights in South Africa|South Africa]] was the first country to explicitly add intersex to legislation, as part of the attribute of 'sex'.&lt;ref name="zagaz"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2005-022.pdf | title = Judicial Matters Amendment Act, No. 22 of 2005, Republic of South Africa, Vol. 487, Cape Town | date = 11 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intersex rights in Australia|Australia]] was the first country to add an independent attribute, of 'intersex status'.&lt;ref name="com law"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013A00098 | title = Sex Discrimination Amendment (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) Act 2013, No. 98, 2013, C2013A00098 | work = ComLaw | date = 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006122244/http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013A00098 | archivedate = 2014-10-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intersex rights in Malta|Malta]] was the first to adopt a broader framework of "[[sex characteristics]]", through legislation that also ended modifications to the sex characteristics of minors undertaken for social and cultural reasons.&lt;ref name="gate-malta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://transactivists.org/2015/04/08/making-depathologization-a-matter-of-law-a-comment-from-gate-on-the-maltese-act-on-gender-identity-gender-expression-and-sex-characteristics/ |title=Making depathologization a matter of law.

== Right to life ==
{{further|Genetic diagnosis of intersex}}
Intersex people face genetic de-selection via pregnancy terminations and [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]], as well as abandonment, neglect, infanticide and murder due to their [[sex characteristics]]. In 2015, the [[Council of Europe]] published an Issue Paper on ''Human rights and intersex people'', remarking:

{{quotation|Intersex people's right to life can be violated in discriminatory "sex selection" and "preimplantation genetic diagnosis, other forms of testing, and selection for particular characteristics".

Decision-making on any cancer and other physical risks may be intertwined with "normalizing" rationales. In a major Parliamentary report in Australia, published in October 2013, the Senate Community Affairs References committee was "disturbed" by the possible implications of current practices in the treatment of cancer risk. The committee stated: "clinical intervention pathways stated to be based on probabilities of cancer risk may be encapsulating treatment decisions based on other factors, such as the desire to conduct normalising surgery... Treating cancer may be regarded as unambiguously therapeutic treatment, while normalising surgery may not. Thus basing a decision on cancer risk might avoid the need for court oversight in a way that a decision based on other factors might not. The committee is disturbed by the possible implications of this..."&lt;ref name="SenateOnSterilisation" /&gt;

== Inciting hate crimes by allegations of sex crimes ==
One increasingly common cause of [[hate crime]]s against intersex people is the neurological claim that male and female brains have fundamentally different sexualities, in particular the claim that men are sexually impulsive and aggressive and bound to act on their sexual fantasies while most women are said to have a wider range of sexual fantasies than most men, including fantasies that it would be unacceptable to act on. The claim that a combination of one trait that most men have and one trait that most women have would produce a sex criminal adds up to allegations that intersex people are sex offenders. To decrease such severe discrimination against intersex people, some researchers advocate more public information about the error sources in the sexological studies that are said to show such sex differences. This includes the possibility that societal double standards may scare more men than women into not talking about or otherwise revealing their sex fantasies (corroborated by the existence of characteristics that differ between male volunteers and male nonvolunteers, but not between female volunteers and female nonvolunteers, in erotica research) giving a false appearance of men having narrower ranges of sexual fantasies than women, and the possibility that men who want to be castrated out of their spiritual beliefs may have to commit sex crimes and claim that it was due to uncontrollable urges to get castrated since such surgery is not off the shelf (corroborated by the overrepresentation of religious groups in child sexual abuse scandals that cannot be explained by biopsychiatric correlations) creating a false appearance of men being less able to control their sexual impulses than women. Certain intersex rights advocates argue that this may dispel the myth that intersex people are "hybrid degenerated" to be sex criminals, creating more understanding for intersex people.&lt;ref&gt;Trans and Intersex People: Discrimination on the Grounds of Sex, Gender Identity and Gender Expression, 2012, Christa Tobler and Silvan Agius&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Between the Sexes: A Preliminary Study on the Life Situations of Inter*individuals, 2013, Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suicide and self-harm ==

The impact of discrimination and stigma can also be seen in high rates of suicidal tendencies and self harm. Multiple anecdotal reports, including from [[Intersex rights in China|Hong Kong]] and [[Intersex rights in Kenya|Kenya]] point to high levels of suicidality amongst intersex people.&lt;ref name="luk-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="odhiambo-2016" /&gt; The Australian sociological study of 272 people born with atypical sex characteristics found that 60% had thought about suicide, and 42% thought about self-harm, "on the basis of issues related to having an intersex variation ... 19% had attempted suicide"; causes identified included stigma, discrimination, family rejection and school bullying.&lt;ref name="jones2016ed" /&gt;

A 2013 German clinical study found high rates of distress, with "prevalence rates of self-harming behavior and suicidal tendencies ... comparable to traumatized women with a history of physical or sexual abuse."&lt;ref name="schutzmann"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s10508-007-9241-9| issn = 0004-0002| volume = 38| issue = 1| pages = 16–33| last1 = Schützmann| first1 = Karsten| last2 = Brinkmann| first2 = Lisa| last3 = Schacht| first3 = Melanie| last4 = Richter-Appelt| first4 = Hertha| title = Psychological Distress, Self-Harming Behavior, and Suicidal Tendencies in Adults with Disorders of Sex Development| journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior| date = February 2009 | url = https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10508-007-9241-9| pmid=17943433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar results have been reported in Australia&lt;ref name="schutzmann" /&gt; and Denmark.&lt;ref name="liao-2013" /&gt;

== Education ==

An [[Intersex rights in Australia|Australian]] sociological survey of 272 persons born with atypical sex characteristics, published in 2016, found that 18% of respondents (compared to an Australian average of 2%) failed to complete secondary school, with early school leaving coincident with pubertal medical interventions, bullying on the basis of physical characteristics, and other factors.&lt;ref name="jones2016ed"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/14681811.2016.1149808| issn = 1468-1811 | pages = 1–17| last = Jones| first = Tiffany| title = The needs of students with intersex variations| journal = Sex Education| accessdate = 2016-05-28| date = March 11, 2016 | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14681811.2016.1149808}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Intersex rights in Kenya|Kenyan]] news report suggests high rates of early school leaving, with the organisation Gama Africa reporting that 60% of 132 known intersex people had dropped out of school "because of the harassment and treatment they received from their peers and their teachers".&lt;ref name="odhiambo-2016"/&gt;

The Australian study found that schools lacked inclusive services such as relevant puberty and sex education curricula and counselling, for example, not representing a full range of human bodily diversity. Only a quarter of respondents felt positive about their schooling experiences, schooling coincided with disclosure of an intersex condition, associated with well-being risks, and early school leaving peaked "during the years most associated with puberty and hormone therapy interventions".&lt;ref name="jones2016ed" /&gt; Cognitive differences may also be associated with some traits such as sex chromosome variations.&lt;ref name="hong-2014"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2790-13.2014| issn = 0270-6474| volume = 34| issue = 10| pages = 3509–3516| last1 = Hong| first1 = D.

== Poverty and employment discrimination ==

The impact of discrimination and stigma can be seen in high rates of poverty. A 2015 Australian survey of people born with atypical sex characteristics found high levels of poverty, in addition to very high levels of early school leaving, and higher than average rates of disability.&lt;ref name="jonesbk2016"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Open Book Publishers| isbn = 978-1-78374-208-0| last1 = Jones| first1 = Tiffany| last2 = Hart| first2 = Bonnie| last3 = Carpenter| first3 = Morgan| last4 = Ansara| first4 = Gavi| last5 = Leonard| first5 = William| last6 = Lucke| first6 = Jayne| title = Intersex: Stories and Statistics from Australia| location = Cambridge, UK| accessdate = 2016-02-02| date = February 2016| url = http://oii.org.au/wp-content/uploads/key/Intersex-Stories-Statistics-Australia.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160914152729/http://oii.org.au/wp-content/uploads/key/Intersex-Stories-Statistics-Australia.pdf| archivedate = 2016-09-14| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 6% of the 272 survey participants reported being homeless or couch surfing.&lt;ref name="jones2016ed" /&gt;

'''Drafting''' is the preliminary stage of a written work in which the author begins to develop a more cohesive product. A '''draft document''' is the product the writer creates in the initial stages of the [[writing process]].

In the drafting stage, the author:
* develops a more cohesive text
* organizes thoughts
* explains examples/ideas
* uncovers transitions
* discovers a central argument/point
* elaborates on key ideas

In a book that became popular in the 1950s, ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', famed authors Strunk and White describe the first draft as being a less edited version of the final draft.  In their book, Strunk and White say, “the first principle of composition is to foresee or determine the shape of what is to come and pursue that shape.&lt;ref&gt;The Elements of Style Fiftieth Anniversary Edition (2009), p. 15, {{ISBN|978-0-205-63264-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;” This shape is the draft that eventually becomes the finished work.

More recently, [[Peter Elbow]], in his book ''Writing Without Teachers'', presents a very different view of the drafting stage in the [[writing process]]. He describes his stance on the writing process, saying “Writing is a way to end up thinking something you couldn’t have started out thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Elbow, Peter. Writing Without Teachers. 2nd ed. New York: Oxford UP, 1973, 1998. p.15&lt;/ref&gt;” According to Elbow, the best way to accomplish this is a series of drafts which come together to produce an emerging “center of gravity” that then translates into the main focus on the work. This process should be a holistic process, not a linear process. Elbow’s reasoning behind this concept of multiple drafts follows the idea that, “if he learns to maximize the interaction among his own ideas or points of view, he can produce new ones that didn’t seem available to him.&lt;ref&gt;Elbow, Peter. Writing Without Teachers. 2nd ed. New York: Oxford UP, 1973, 1998. p.50&lt;/ref&gt;”

Whether being used as the creation of a less-edited final product (Strunk and White) or as a tool during the prewriting stage (Elbow), drafting is a necessary stage for the writer in the writing process.  Having created a draft, the author is then able to move onto the revision.

'''Economic sociology''' is the study of the social cause and effect of various economic phenomena. The field can be broadly divided into a classical period and a contemporary one, known as "New economic sociology".

The classical period was concerned particularly with [[modernity]] and its constituent aspects which are [[rationalisation (sociology)|rationalisation]], [[secularisation]], [[urbanisation]], [[social stratification]], and so on. As [[sociology]] arose primarily as a reaction to [[capitalist]] modernity, economics played a role in much classic sociological inquiry. The specific term "economic sociology" was first coined by [[William Stanley Jevons]] in 1879, later to be used in the works of [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]] between 1890 and 1920.&lt;ref name="press.princeton.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7525.html |title=Principles of Economic Sociology by Richard Swedberg&amp;nbsp;– An extract |accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weber's work regarding the [[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism|relationship between economics and religion]] and the cultural "[[rationalization (sociology)|disenchantment]]" of the modern [[Western World|West]] is perhaps most iconic of the approach set forth in the classic period of economic sociology.

Contemporary economic sociology may include studies of all modern social aspects of economic phenomena; economic sociology may thus be considered a field in the intersection of [[economics]] and sociology. Frequent areas of inquiry in contemporary economic sociology include the social consequences of economic exchanges, the social meanings they involve and the social interactions they facilitate or obstruct.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Swedberg (1990). Economics and Sociology: Redefining Their Boundaries: Conversations with Economists and Sociologists. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-00376-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-691-00376-4}} Description and chapter-preview links, pp. v-vi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical==
Economic sociology arose as a new approach to the analysis of economic phenomena; emphasizing particularly the role economic structures and institutions play upon society, and the influence a society holds over the nature of economic structures and institutions. The relationship between [[capitalism]] and [[modernity]] is a salient issue, perhaps best demonstrated in Weber's ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1905) and Simmel's ''[[The Philosophy of Money]]'' (1900). Economic sociology may be said to have begun with [[Tocqueville]]'s ''[[Democracy in America]]'' (1835–40) and ''[[The Old Regime and the Revolution]]'' (1856).&lt;ref name="press.princeton.edu"/&gt; Marx's [[historical materialism]] would attempt to demonstrate how economic forces influence the structure of society on a fundamental level. [[Émile Durkheim]]'s ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' was published in 1922, whilst [[Max Weber]]'s ''[[Economy and Society]]'' was released in the same year.

==Contemporary==

Contemporary economic sociology focuses particularly on the social consequences of economic exchanges, the social meanings they involve and the social interactions they facilitate or obstruct. Influential figures in modern economic sociology include [[Fred L. Block]], [[James Samuel Coleman|James S. Coleman]], [[Paula England]], [[Mark Granovetter]], [[Harrison White]], [[Paul DiMaggio]], [[Joel M. Podolny]], [[Lynette Spillman]], [[Richard Swedberg]] and [[Viviana Zelizer]] in the United States, as well as [[Carlo Trigilia]],&lt;ref name=gil&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilding|first=Michael|title=The New Economic Sociology and Its Relevance to Australia|journal=Journal of Sociology|date=September 2005|volume=41|issue=3|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-138056001/the-new-economic-sociology-and-its-relevance-to-australia|accessdate=1 September 2013}}{{Subscription required|via=Questia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Donald Angus MacKenzie]], [[Laurent Thévenot]] and Jens Beckert in Europe. To this may be added [[Amitai Etzioni]], who has developed the idea of [[socioeconomics]],&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, Amitai. 1988. The Moral Dimension: Toward a New Economics. Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Chuck Sabel, [[Wolfgang Streeck]] and [[Michael Mousseau]] who work in the tradition of [[political economy]]/[[political sociology|sociology]].

The focus on mathematical analysis and [[Utility|utility maximisation]] during the 20th century has led some to see economics as a discipline moving away from its roots in the social sciences. Many critiques of economics or economic policy begin from the accusation that abstract modelling is missing some key social phenomenon that needs to be addressed.

Economic sociology is an attempt by sociologists to redefine in sociological terms questions traditionally addressed by economists. It is thus also an answer to attempts by economists (such as [[Gary Becker]]) to bring economic approaches&amp;nbsp;– in particular utility maximisation and [[game theory]]&amp;nbsp;– to the analysis of social situations that are not obviously related to production or trade. [[Karl Polanyi]], in his book ''The Great Transformation'', was the first theorist to come up with the idea of the "embeddedness", meaning that the economy is "embedded" in social institutions which are vital so that the market does not destroy other aspects of human life. The concept of "embeddedness" serves sociologists who study technological developments. Mark Granovetter and Patrick McGuire mapped the social networks which determined the economics of the electrical industry in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Granovetter, Mark, and McGuire, Patrick (1998) “The Making of an Industry: Electricity
in the United States.” In: M. Callon (ed.) The Laws of the Markets. Oxford:
Blackwell, 147–173.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ronen Shamir analyzed how electrification in Mandatory Palestine facilitated the creation of an ethnic-based dual-economy.&lt;ref&gt;Shamir, Ronen (2013) Current Flow: The Electrification of Palestine. Stanford: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Polanyi's form of market skepticism, however, has been criticized for intensifying rather than limiting the economization of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=2192754 |last=Roth |first= |year=2012 |title=Leaving commonplaces on the commonplace. Cornerstones of a polyphonic market theory |journal=Journal for Critical Organization Inquiry |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=43–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New economic sociology===
A contemporary period of economic sociology, often known as ''new economic sociology'', was consolidated by the 1985 work of [[Mark Granovetter]] titled "Economic Action and Social Structure: The Problem of Embeddedness".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Granovetter The American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 91, No. 3 (Nov., 1985), pp. 481-510 http://glennschool.osu.edu/faculty/brown/home/Org%20Theory/Readings/Granovetter1985.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These works elaborated the concept of [[embeddedness]], which states that economic relations between individuals or firms take place within existing social relations (and are thus structured by these relations as well as the greater social structures of which those relations are a part). [[Social network|Social network analysis]] has been the primary methodology for studying this phenomenon. Granovetter's theory of the [[Mark Granovetter#The strength of weak ties|strength of weak ties]] and [[Ronald Burt|Ronald Burt's]] concept of structural holes are two best known theoretical contributions of this field.

==Marxist sociology==
{{Main article|Marxist sociology}}
Modern [[Marxist]] thought has focused on the social implications of [[capitalism]] (or "[[commodity fetishism]]") and [[economic development]] within the system of economic relations that produce them. Important theorists include [[Georg Lukács]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Guy Debord]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Nicos Poulantzas]], [[Ralph Miliband]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Raymond Williams]], [[Fredric Jameson]], [[Antonio Negri]], and [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Socioeconomics==
{{Main article|Socioeconomics}}
Economic sociology is sometimes synonymous with [[socioeconomics]]. Socioeconomics deals with the analytical, political and moral questions arising at the intersection between economy and society from a broad interdisciplinary perspective with links beyond sociology to political economy, moral philosophy, [[institutional economics]] and history.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

At the turn of the 20th century, ethnic whites tended to migrate to urban enclaves on the East Coast and parts of the Midwest. Mexican immigrants settled along South-west border. Chinese immigrants, prior to the Chinese exclusion act, moved and settled along the Pacific states. The regulation of immigrants ebbed and flowed according to economic demands of the labor market and home country's domestic issues. Examples include availability of mine work, railroad building, and steel production or lack of home country's ability to provide adequate career opportunities, food or security.

Working class and low skilled immigrants tended to cluster in the [[ethnic enclave]]s such as Chinatowns, Little Italy's and Koreatowns. This was the result of [[chain migration]], [[Immigration to the United States|US migration policy]], and the placement of availability of jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schaefer|first=Richard T.|title=Race and ethnicity in the United States|year=2013|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Boston|isbn=0205216331|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]], educated and well skilled immigrant populations did not cluster like their blue collared counterparts. This is particularly true of Indian doctors and Filipino nurses. Both groups have a large population in absolute numbers, but are not as culturally visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Portes|first=Alejandro|title=Immigrant America : a portrait|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520250419|edition=3rd ed., rev., expanded, and updated.|author2=Rumbaut, Rubén G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general immigrants worked for lower wages, and for longer hours, under less-regulated working conditions in dangerous or unhealthy working conditions. Low wages and minimal oversight have widened corporate profits. This is true even for skilled and educated immigrants. Asians on average tend to make more money than Whites. However, when comparing similar high status jobs, Whites still make more. This may explain continued American economic growth since 1965.

In regards to US migration policy, from a [[structural functionalist]] point of view, illegal immigration is tacitly approved by the government and businesses despite surges in nativism starting in the 1980s. As the American population declines, the tax base to support social welfare programs such as Medicare and Social Security shrinks as well. Therefore, government welfare programs are dependent on some level to illegal immigrants who pay into the benefits, but will not receive them in their lifetimes. Further, both their legal and illegal children maintain a positive birth to death ratio, with more individuals living in America paying taxes than those dying. Illegal immigrants and their children play a fundamental role in maintaining government revenues. However, with a functionalist interpretation, it is in the government's best interest to keep these populations suppressed. This is where the interest of government and business intersect: If the undocumented workers were to be documented, employers would be forced to increase wages and the states would offer government assistance. With the fear of deportation after a lengthy detainment from the government and cases of harassment, abuse, rape and intimidation by employers, many illegal immigrants remain quiet about their plight. The second generation immigrants typically display [[reactive ethnic identities]] in response to the suppression and abuse their parents faced, further straining already strained race relations in America.

Nonetheless, due to the diffused structure of the US government and nativist sentiments, mass incarcerations and deportations are on the uptick in America. This has proven to be disastrous to local economies. In the [[Postville Raid]] of 2008, 400 men, women and children were detained by ICE, one third of the town's population. This immediately resulted in the closing of a local food processing plant and immediate decrease in local economic demand. It is estimated that within a radius of twenty miles, 2,800 other jobs were lost – drivers, coffee shop owners and alike – and millions of dollars of lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=US Immigration Reform and Its Global Impact: Lessons from the Postville Raid|year=2013|author= Erik Camayd-Freixas|OL=26175863M|isbn=0230105858}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city of Postville asked the Federal government to declare its city as 'disaster zone' given the immediate drop in economic activity. The deportation of undocumented workers had secondary effects for the immigrants' families in their native countries, whose poverty was worsened when the detained individuals could not send remittances. There is a reported case of teenage suicide when the boy had not heard from his father in months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Camayd-Freixas|first=Erik|title=U.S. immigration reform and its transnational impact : a case study of the Postville raid|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=0230105858|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some corners sociological debate today focuses on new immigrants' ability to find employment and to achieve economic self-sufficiency.

According to George Borjas in an essay titled "The Economics of Immigration" (1994), since the 1980s the United States has attracted "lower quality" immigrants with less education and few marketable job skills. Borjas' estimates show that as high as 21 percent of immigrant households participate in social assistance programs consisting of social welfare programs like food stamps and Medicaid. Additionally, economic assimilation is slow due to immigrant's difficulty in securing adequate employment.

Julian Simon, in addition to other economists and policy analysts, claims that recent immigration has either had a positive or neutral effect on the economy. Simon argues that immigrants and their children add to the labor force, paying into long-term benefits such as Social Security.

==Academic associations==
The Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics (SASE) is an international academic association whose members are involved in social studies of economy and economic processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sase.org |title=The Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics |publisher=SASE |accessdate=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Socio-Economic Review]]'' was established as the official journal of SASE in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ser.oxfordjournals.org/|title=Socio-Economic Review |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal aims to encourage work on the relationship between society, economy, institutions and markets, moral commitments and the rational pursuit of self-interest. Most articles focus on economic action in its social and historical context, drawing from sociology, political science, economics and the management and policy sciences. According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the journal has a 2015 [[impact factor]] of 1.926, ranking it 56th out of 344 journals in the category "Economics", 21st out of 163 journals in the category "Political Science" and 19th out of 142 journals in the category "Sociology".&lt;ref name=WoS&gt;{{cite book |year=2016 |chapter=Journals Ranked by Impact: Economics, Political Science and Public Administration |title=2015 [[Journal Citation Reports]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |edition=Social Sciences |series=[[Web of Science]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Sociological Association's Economic Sociology section became a permanent Section in January 2001. According to its website, it has about 800 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/asa-communities/asa-sections/all-about-sections/section-membership-history/section-membership-crossrefrence-table |title=Section membership|publisher=American Sociological Association |accessdate=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Space Operations Centre''' ('''ESOC''') serves as the main mission control centre for the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and is located in [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]]. ESOC's primary function is the operation of unmanned spacecraft on behalf of ESA and the launch and early orbit phases (LEOP) of ESA and third-party missions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/About_Operations ESA Spacecraft Operations - About us &amp; frequently asked questions]&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre is also responsible for a range of operations-related activities within ESA and in cooperation with ESA's industry and international partners, including ground systems engineering, software development, flight dynamics and navigation, development of mission control tools and techniques and space debris studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/gse/Building_infrastructure_on_Earth_to_support_satellites_in_space ESA’s Ground Systems Engineering Team]&lt;/ref&gt;

ESOC's current major activities comprise operating planetary and solar missions, such as [[Mars Express]] and the [[ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter]], astronomy &amp; fundamental physics missions, such as [[Gaia (spacecraft)]] and [[XMM-Newton|XMM Newton]], and Earth observation missions such as [[CryoSat-2|CryoSat2]] and [[Swarm (spacecraft)]].

ESOC is responsible for developing, operating and maintaining ESA's [[ESTRACK|ESTRACK network]] of ground stations. Teams at the Centre are also involved in research and development related to advanced mission control concepts and Space Situational Awareness, and standardisation activities related to frequency management; mission operations; tracking, [[telemetry]] and telecommanding; and [[space debris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESOC/Where_missions_come_alive Where missions come alive]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The European Space Operations Centre was formally inaugurated in [[Darmstadt]], Germany, on 8 September 1967 by the then-[[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Minister of Research]] of the Federal Republic of Germany, [[Gerhard Stoltenberg]]. Its role was to provide satellite control for the [[ESRO|European Space Research Organisation]] (ESRO), which is today known as its successor organisation, the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA).&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/ESOC_40_Anniversary/SEMP4R73R8F_0.html ESA pays tribute to ESOC's 40th anniversary]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 90-person ESOC facility was, as it is today, located on the west side of Darmstadt; it employed the staff and resources previously allocated to the European Space Data Centre ([[ESDAC]]), which had been established in 1963 to conduct orbit calculations.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; These were augmented by mission control staff transferred from [[ESTEC]] to operate satellites and manage the [[ESTRACK]] tracking station network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esapub/sp/sp1235/sp1235v2web.pdf History of the European Space Agency 1958 – 1987]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://esamultimedia.esa.int/multimedia/publications/HSR/HSR_08.PDF EUROPE INTO SPACE:THE AUGER YEARS, page 35]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within just eight months, ESOC, as part of ESRO, was already operating its first mission, ESRO-2B, a scientific research satellite and the first of many operated from ESOC for ESRO, and later ESA.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

By July 2012, ESOC had operated over 56 missions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/ESOC/SEMEFCW4QWD_0.html ESA mission history]&lt;/ref&gt; spanning science, Earth observation, orbiting observatories, meteorology and space physics.

==Location and expansion==
[[Image:European Space Operations Centre.jpg|thumb|European Space Operations Centre]]

ESOC is located on the west side of the city of [[Darmstadt]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://goo.gl/maps/rtU9Q Google map]&lt;/ref&gt; some {{convert|500|m|abbr=on}} from the [[Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof|main train station]], at Robert-Bosch-Straße 5. In 2011, ESA announced the first phase of the ESOC II modernisation and expansion project valued at €60 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/ESOC/SEMC2A4SNIG_0.html ESA operations centre to be expanded]&lt;/ref&gt; The new construction will be located across Robert-Bosch-Straße, opposite the current centre.

==Employees==
At ESOC, ESA employs approximately 800, comprising some 250 permanent staff and about 550 contractors. Staff from ESOC are routinely dispatched to work at other ESA establishments, [[ESTRACK]] stations, the [[ATV Control Centre]] (Toulouse), the [[Columbus Control Centre]] (Oberpfaffenhofen) and at partner facilities in several countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Operations/SEMVKB8ZMRE_0.html About us &amp; frequently asked questions (FAQ)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Fabaxo1.jpg|thumb|300px|Fab Tree Hab, a "Local Biota Living Graft Structure"&lt;ref name="TerreformOne" /&gt;]]

The '''Fab Tree Hab''' is a hypothetical ecological home design developed at [[MIT]] by [[Mitchell Joachim]], Javier Arbona and Lara Greden. With the idea of easing the burden Humanity places on the environment with conventional housing by growing "living, breathing" [[tree house|tree homes]].&lt;ref name=CanadaFab&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=6a9be8a7-f32e-4ca6-8446-a23a28dd4594|title=Grow your own home: 'Fab tree hab'|publisher=|accessdate=2015-11-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115053717/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=6a9be8a7-f32e-4ca6-8446-a23a28dd4594|archivedate=2016-01-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It would be built by allowing native trees to grow over a computer-designed ([[CNC]]) removable [[plywood]] [[scaffold]]. Once the plants are interconnected and stable,&lt;ref name="TerreformOne"&gt;{{Cite web |author=Mitchell Joachim |title=Terreform One |url=http://www.archinode.com/bienal.html |accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the plywood would be removed and reused. MIT is experimenting with [[trees]] that grow quickly and develop an interwoven root structure that's soft enough to "train" over the scaffold, but then hardens into a more durable structure. The inside walls would be conventional [[clay]] and [[plaster]].

An old methodology new to buildings is introduced in this design - [[pleaching]]. Pleaching is a method of weaving together tree branches to form living [[arch]]ways, [[latticework|lattice]]s, or screens.&lt;ref name=Technologyreview&gt;{{Cite web|author = Tracy Staedter |title=Architects design a living home|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17102|accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the technique is also named "[[Tree shaping#Aeroponic culture|Aeroponic culture]]". The load-bearing part of the structure uses trees that self-graft or inosculate such as [[Live oak|Live Oak]], [[Elm]] and [[Dogwood]]. The lattice frame for the walls and roof are created with the branches of the trees. Vines create a dense protective layer woven along the exterior, interspersed with soil pockets and growing plants.&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt;

The Fab Tree Hab is an experiment that would develop over time.  Extra operating costs required over the life-time of the home include pest management with organic pesticides and maintenance of the [[living machine]]'s water treatment system.  Technical demonstration and innovation is still needed for certain components, primarily the bioplastic windows that accept growth of the structure and the management of flows across the wall section to assure that the interior remains dry and animal-free.  All in all, the elapsed time to reach livability is greater than the traditional sense, but so should be the health and longevity of the home and family.  Above all, building this home could be achieved at a minimal price. Depending on the surrounding climate the house is to be grown in, the team expect it will take a minimum of five years to complete its structure.&lt;ref name=CanadaFab/&gt;&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt; Realization of these homes will begin as an experiment, and it is envisioned that thereafter, the concept of renewal will take on a new architectural form - one of inter-dependency between nature and people.

As of May 2007 Mitchell Joachim stated that there is a "50 per cent" organic project in California, combining natural elements and traditional construction.&lt;ref name=CanadaFab/&gt;

==Trees==
Main trees suggested to be used are [[elm]]s and [[oak]]s. The teams hopes the homes can be grown using mainly native trees.&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt;

}}'''Five Themes of Geography''' is an educational tool for teaching [[geography]]. Adopted in 1984 by the [[Association of American Geographers]], those five themes were published in the NCGE/AAG publication ''Guidelines for Geographic Education, Elementary, and Secondary Schools''. Most American geography and [[social studies]] [[classroom]]s have adopted the five themes in teaching practices.&lt;ref name="LessonPlanet"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lessonplanet.com/article/elementary-math/geography-lesson-plans-using-google-earth |title=Geography Lesson Plans Using Google Earth |first=Karen |last=Ganzel |accessdate=April 28, 2010 |publisher=Lesson Planet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==

The five-theme organizational approach was superseded by the Geography for Life standards published by the National Geographic Society United States Of America, a set of eighteen standards promulgated in 1994. However, the five themes continue to be used as an educational approach in many educational outlets.&lt;ref name="LessonPlanet"/&gt;

'''Five Themes''':&lt;ref name="5Themes"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://geography.about.com/od/teachgeography/a/5themes.htm |title=The Five Themes of Geography |first=Matt |last=Rosenberg |accessdate=November 16, 2013 |publisher=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Location (geography)|Location]]
* [[Place (geography)|Place]]
* [[Human-Environment Interaction]]
* [[Movement (geography)|Movement]] 
* [[Region]]

===Location=== 
Every point on Earth has a location. Location can be described in two different ways:
* ''Absolute location'', a location as described by its latitude and longitude on the [[Earth]]. For example, the coordinates of [[Albany, New York]] are 42.6525° N, 73.7572° W.
* ''Relative location'', a location as described by where it is compared to something else. For example, [[Albany, New York]] is roughly 140 miles north of New York City.

===Place===
A place is an area that is defined by everything in it. All places have features that give them personality and distinguish them from other places

* Toponym: a place name, especially one derived from a topographical feature.
* Site: an area of ground on which a town, building, or monument is constructed.
* Situation: the location and surroundings of a place.
* Population: the number of people that live in the area.

=== Human-environment interaction ===
{{see|human-environment interaction}}
This theme describes how people interact with the environment, and how the environment responds, with three key concepts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.csustan.edu/sites/default/files/TeacherEd/FacultyStaff/betts/Handouts/PDFs/Five%20Themes%20of%20Geography.pdf | title=The Five Themes of Geography | accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Dependency: Humans depend on the environment.
*[[Adaptation]]: Humans adapt to the environment.
*Modification: Humans modify the environment.

=== Movement ===
Movement is the [[travel]] of [[people]], [[Good (economics and accounting)|good]]s, and [[idea]]s from one location to another, or political events. Examples of movement include the [[United States]]' [[westward expansion]], the [[Information Revolution]], and [[immigration]]. New devices such as the [[airplane]] and the [[Internet]] allow physical and ideological goods to be transferred long distances in short time intervals. A person's travel from place to place, and the actions they perform there are also considered movement.


Example: Buses, Airplanes, Cars, and Boats.

=== Region ===
Regions are areas with distinctive characteristics: human characteristics, such as demographics or politics, and physical characteristics, such as climate and vegetation. For example, the US is a political region because it shares one governmental system.

Sir '''Peter Francis Lewis Bourgeois''' [[Royal Academy|RA]] (November 1753 – 8 January 1811) was a British  [[landscape art|landscape]] and history painter, and court painter to king [[George III of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Redgrave, Samuel|authorlink=Samuel Redgrave|chapter=Bourgeois, Sir Francis|title=A dictionary of artists of the English school|year=1878|pages=49–50|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=gri.ark:/13960/t3613cq79;view=1up;seq=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=SIR FRANCIS BOURGEOIS, R.A.|journal=The Art Journal|year=1891|volume=43|pages=344|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RbghAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA344}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became an art dealer and collector in association with [[Margaret Desenfans|Margaret]] and Noel Desenfans, and with them founded [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] in London.  

==Biography==
Bourgeois was born in London in November 1753 (or, according to Royal Academy records, in 1756). He was the son of Isaac Emanuel Bourgeois, a prosperous emigre Swiss watchmaker, and Elizabeth Bourgeois (née Gordon or Garden). He had a sister. In 1768, when he was fifteen, his mother died and he and his sister were abandoned by their father. Some time afterwards he was taken into the protection of Noel Joseph Desenfans, a writer who had come from France to Britain in 1769.

Bourgeois studied painting as a pupil of [[Philip James de Loutherbourg]]. In 1776, at the age of 23, Bourgeois made a tour of Europe. When in Warsaw he met bishop [[Michal Jerzy Poniatowski]], primate of Poland and brother of the Polish king, [[Stanisław August Poniatowski|Stanislaw II]].

In the same year his protector Noel Desenfans married Margaret Morris, an heiress and sister of the Swansea industrialist, [[Sir John Morris, 1st Baronet|John Morris]]. By the 1780s Margaret and Noel Desenfans were collecting pictures and discreetly dealing. Bourgeois lived with them at their house in Charlotte (now Hallam) Street, London.

In December 1787 Bourgeois was elected an Associate of the [[Royal Academy]] and was elected a full member on 11 February 1793, when he donated a landscape painting as his diploma work.

In 1791 Bourgeois's friend, Michal Poniatowski visited London to commission Bourgeois to paint a portrait of king [[Stanisław II August Poniatowski|Stanislaw]] (now in [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]]). For this Bourgeois was presented with the Polish medal "Merentibus", for which George III allowed him to use the title of 'Sir' in Britain. While in London Poniatowski asked Noel and Margaret Desenfans and Bourgeois to assemble a royal collection for Poland. During the next five years Bourgeois joined Margaret and Noel Desenfans touring Europe and buying pictures and continued his own painting In 1794 he was appointed landscape-painter to George III.

The collection assembled for King Stanislaw included works by Vernet, Rembrandt, Veronese and others. In 1795 Desenfans was appointed Polish consul general in London; but a few months later Stanislaw was forced to abdicate and the dealers were left with the collection. Their attempts to sell it to Alexander I of Russia or the [[British Government]] proved unsuccessful and in 1799 Desenfans published a ''Plan''&lt;ref&gt;N. J. Desenfans, ''A Plan, Preceded By A Short Review Of The Fine Arts, To Preserve Among Us, And To Transmit To Posterity, The Portraits Of The Most Distinguished Characters ... Also, To give Encouragement to British Artists, and to enrich and adorn London with some Galleries of Pictures, Statues ... Without any Expence to Government'' (1799)&lt;/ref&gt; for establishing some national galleries in Britain, of which the collection might form a basis, and in 1802 he exhibited the collection in London with a sale ''Catalogue''.&lt;ref&gt;''A Descriptive Catalogue (With Remarks And Anecdotes Never Before Published In English) Of Some Pictures Of The Different Schools, Purchased For His Majesty The Late King Of Poland; Which will be exhibited early in 1802 ... By Noel Desenfans ...'' (2nd. ed., 2 vols. 1802)&lt;/ref&gt; The collection remained unsold. Bourgeois shared the Desenfans' wish that the collection should be exhibited publicly, and when he died in 1811 he left it to [[Dulwich College]] with £10,000 to build a public gallery.  [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] - one of the first public art galleries anywhere in Britain was founded. The gallery was designed by Sir [[John Soane]], who also designed the attached mausoleum, in which  Bourgeois, Margaret Desenfans and Nöel Desenfans rest in sealed coffins (visible on request).

A portrait of Bourgeois by [[William Beechey]] is in the collection of the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] and another by [[James Northcote (painter)|James Northcote]] is at the [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]]. [[George Dance the Younger]] made a pencil portrait of him, and he is included in H. Singleton's ''The Royal Academicians in general assembly 1795'' (at the Royal Academy of Arts, London).

Family members of Francis Bourgeois included Victor H. Bourgeois (1864&amp;ndash;1935) and Louise Forget-Bourgeois (1830&amp;ndash;1914).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2794">The '''fuzzy finite element''' method combines the well-established [[finite element method]] with the concept of [[fuzzy number]]s, the latter being a special case of a [[fuzzy set]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Hanss]], 2005. ''Applied Fuzzy Arithmetic, An Introduction with Engineering Applications''. Springer, {{ISBN|3-540-24201-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of using [[fuzzy number]]s instead of [[real numbers]] lies in the incorporation of [[uncertainty]] (on material properties, parameters, geometry, initial conditions, etc.) in the finite element analysis. 

One way to establish a fuzzy finite element (FE) analysis is to use existing FE software (in-house or commercial) as an inner-level module to compute a [[deterministic]] result, and to add an outer-level loop to handle the fuzziness (uncertainty). This outer-level loop comes down to solving an [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problem. If the inner-level deterministic module produces [[monotonic]] behavior with respect to the input variables, then the outer-level optimization problem is greatly simplified, since in this case the [[Maxima and minima|extrema]] will be located at the [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]].

Parabolic Equation

Traditional finite element method is a well-established method to solve various problems of science and engineering. Different authors have used various methods to solve governing differential equation of heat conduction problem. In this study, heat conduction in a circular rod has been considered which is made up of two different materials viz. aluminum and copper. In earlier studies parameters in the differential equation have been taken as fixed numbers which actually may not. Those parameters are found in general by some measurements or experiments. So the material properties are actually uncertain and may be considered to vary in an interval or as fuzzy and in that case complex interval arithmetic or fuzzy arithmetic has to be considered in the analysis.Hence interval/fuzzy arithmetic is applied in the finite element method to solve a steady state heat conduction problem. Application of fuzzy finite element method in the said problem gives fuzzy system of linear equations in general. Here we have also proposed new methods to handle such type of fuzzy system of linear equations. Corresponding results are computed and has been reported here.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarangam Majumdar]], 2012. ''Fuzzy Finite Element Method for One-dimensional Steady State Heat Conduction Problem''. Thesis, &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Global Implementation Plan to End Violence Against Women and Girls''' was a recommendation from the multi-agency [[EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls|Expert Group Meeting (EGM) on the prevention of violence against women and girls]]. The meeting was convened as part of the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women|United Nations Commission on the Status of Women's]] multi-year programme of work for 2010-2014.

The "Elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls" formed a priority theme for its [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women#Session reports|fifty-seventh session in 2013 (CSW57).]]
{{TOClimit}}

==Background==
The [[EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls|EGM]] took place in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]] 17 - 20 September 2012 and was organised by the [[United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women]] ([[UN Women]]), in collaboration with the following organisations:
*[[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] (ESCAP);
*[[United Nations Development Programme]] ([[UNDP]]);
*[[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA);
*[[United Nations Children’s Fund]] ([[UNICEF]]) and;
*[[World Health Organization]] ([[WHO]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwomen.org/en/events/59/expert-group-meeting-prevention-of-violence-against-women-and-girls/ EGM announced, [[UN Women]]'s website.]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved 28 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The report that the meeting produced reflected the shared discussion and analysis of the major issues, gaps and challenges identified at the [[EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls|EGM]] and presented key findings and recommendations. It was intended to build on the individual papers on specific issues provided by experts prior to the meeting, and the background paper prepared by the rapporteur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwomen.org/events/59/expert-group-meeting-prevention-of-violence-against-women-and-girls/ EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls.] Background papers. Retrieved 8 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It provided inputs for the reports of the Secretary-General to the CSW and was widely disseminated in preparation to the fifty-seventh session of CSW.

[[EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#A_global_implementation_plan_to_end_violence_against_women_and_girls|Recommendations 106 - 109]] of the [[EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls|EGM]] calls for a global plan to be launched by 2015, to end violence against women and girls organised along these lines:-

'''Recommendation 109'''&lt;br /&gt;''The Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls, endorsed and supported by Member States at its launch, would aim to:''
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Intensify and scale-up global awareness of violence against women and girls as a global emergency.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Combine the best thinking on how to proceed with concrete pledges for action.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Mobilise international, regional and national action by governments, multilaterals, the private sector and civil society.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Build the foundation for an evidence and practice-informed global prevention strategy.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Increase resources available to end violence against women and girls.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

'''Recommendation 111'''&lt;br /&gt;''Development of the plan would require, among other things:''
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Identification of a small set of key policy, legal and programme-delivery targets (institutions) at the national level towards which global violence prevention efforts can be directed.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Detailed review of existing action plans, indicators, recommendations, platforms for action, policy agendas, and recommendations outlined by the Security Council, UN Treaty bodies, the special rapporteurs, and various UN agencies, with a view to closing implementation gaps and building the next stage.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Creation of a cohesive global community of key stakeholders.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Designation of strong coordinating mechanisms.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Development of an accountability framework with indicators to measure State responsiveness to the policy, legal and programme-delivery goals identified and an independent monitoring mechanism.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==United Nations Commission on the Status of Women - fifty-seventh session==
The [[United_Nations_Commission_on_the_Status_of_Women#Session_reports|fifty-seventh session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]] took place at the UN building, New York between 4 and 15 March 2013. The agreed conclusions from the session agreed the following four actions:
&lt;ol type="A"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthening implementation of legal and policy frameworks and accountability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Addressing structural and underlying causes and risk factors so as to prevent violence against women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthening multisectorial services, programmes and responses to violence against women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving the evidence-base.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/csw/csw57/CSW57_agreed_conclusions_advance_unedited_version_18_March_2013.pdf Unedited draft.] Retrieved 11 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ISSN|0252-0117}} [https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E/2013/27 Final draft, pp. 1-17.] Retrieved 11 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

[[UN Women|UN Women's]] Executive Director [[Michelle Bachelet]] urged speedy implementation of the Agreed Conclusions saying, "The best way to honour the commitments made by Member States at the Commission is to work for implementation and accountability."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unwomen.org/2013/03/un-women-urges-implementation-of-historic-global-agreement-to-end-violence-against-women-and-girls/ Press release from UN Women, "UN Women urges implementation of historic global agreement to end violence against women and girls", 20 March 2013.

'''Grooveshark University''' was a free, [[semester]]-long [[Education|program]] offered by [[software engineer]]s at [[Grooveshark.com]] to intermediate [[Computer programmer|programmer]]s at the [[college]] level and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|url=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grooveshark offered the initiative to help programmers gain the experience needed to develop their own technological innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20101217/ARTICLES/101219630|url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20101217/ARTICLES/101219630|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enrollment was by application only, and was not limited to college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|url=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_eeb3c08a-01bb-11e0-b8fd-001cc4c03286.html|url=http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_eeb3c08a-01bb-11e0-b8fd-001cc4c03286.html|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Grooveshark University was developed to help ease new [[intern]]s into Grooveshark's work environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|url=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gradually, the program grew into a hub for idea creation, technical learning, and [[prototype]] development, as Grooveshark saw "potential for other ideas developed in Gainesville to grow into full-fledged businesses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20101217/ARTICLES/101219630|url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20101217/ARTICLES/101219630|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grooveshark University was part of an ongoing process to promote innovation in the [[Gainesville, Florida]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.wcjb.com/news/8462/technology-spotlight-1-4-11-grooveshark-u|url=http://www.wcjb.com/news/8462/technology-spotlight-1-4-11-grooveshark-u|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program's mission was to provide an environment where interested developers, young and old, can hone their skills or work with other developers to create new projects and pursue great ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.gainesvillechamber.com/Tech_Entrepreneurs_Give_Back.aspx|url=http://www.gainesvillechamber.com/Tech_Entrepreneurs_Give_Back.aspx|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.wcjb.com/news/8462/technology-spotlight-1-4-11-grooveshark-u|url=http://www.wcjb.com/news/8462/technology-spotlight-1-4-11-grooveshark-u|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classes==
The GSU lectures focused on a variety of different technical topics, including: [[Mobile application development|mobile]] and [[web development]], web standards, and specific [[programming languages]] like [[Python (programming language)|Python]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|url=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.wcjb.com/news/8462/technology-spotlight-1-4-11-grooveshark-u|url=http://www.wcjb.com/news/8462/technology-spotlight-1-4-11-grooveshark-u|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Weekly sessions were held in the evening&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://grooveshark.com/university|url=http://grooveshark.com/university|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   at Santa Fe College's downtown Center for Innovation and Economic Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20101217/ARTICLES/101219630|url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20101217/ARTICLES/101219630|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meetings typically included [[presentation]]s by Grooveshark developers and group discussions for [[Business networking|networking]] with other programmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://grooveshark.com/university|url=http://grooveshark.com/university|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Students==
[[Undergraduate]] students, [[Graduate school|graduate]] students, and experienced developers have taken part in Grooveshark University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_eeb3c08a-01bb-11e0-b8fd-001cc4c03286.html|url=http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_eeb3c08a-01bb-11e0-b8fd-001cc4c03286.html|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grooveshark said it looked for individuals "with a lot of raw potential"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.wuftfm.org/news/index.php?id=446|url=http://www.wuftfm.org/news/index.php?id=446|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  when choosing participants for the program.

The program is selective. In the first semester, 25 of 50 original applicants were accepted as students, and of that group, fewer than 15 students completed the first semester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|url=http://news.sfcollege.edu/read.php/2010/11/17/grooveshark-university-offers-course-at-the-cied.html|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application process screened for personality as well as skill, and favored candidates who were comfortable working with other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.wcjb.com/news/8462/technology-spotlight-1-4-11-grooveshark-u|url=http://www.wcjb.com/news/8462/technology-spotlight-1-4-11-grooveshark-u|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students of Grooveshark University were encouraged to create their own projects outside of the weekly [[lecture]]s. Graduating students have produced projects such as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_eeb3c08a-01bb-11e0-b8fd-001cc4c03286.html|url=http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_eeb3c08a-01bb-11e0-b8fd-001cc4c03286.html|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John E. Penick''' is an American professor of [[science education]] who has taught in high schools, community college, and at several universities in the United States and abroad. Author of more than 200 articles in professional journals and 40 books and monographs, Penick is best known for promoting innovative programs and processes for enhancing undergraduate teacher education.&lt;ref&gt;Yager, R. E. and Penick, J. E. (1990). Science education. Chapter 36 of Houston, R. E. (Ed.) Handbook of Research on Teacher Education&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiiBmQ0bQGg |title=IT'S ABOUT TIME® Interviews Dr. John Penick at NSTA 2014 |publisher=YouTube |date=2014-04-11 |accessdate=2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his innovations were based on his studies of exemplary teachers in the United States, studies that focused on determining the roles of effective teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Penick, J. E., Yager, R. E., and Bonnstetter, R. (October, 1986). Teachers make exemplary programs. Educational Leadership, 44(2), 14-20&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his work with undergraduates, Penick has conducted workshops and presentations for teachers in almost every state of the U.S., speaking about and demonstrating how research can inform teacher practice and conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Penick, J.E. and Harris, R.L. (2005). Teaching with Purpose. Arlington VA: NSTA Press. 66 pages&lt;/ref&gt; Widening his scope, Penick has worked extensively with a variety of international universities, ministries of education, and organizations in 35 countries.

==Education==
Penick received his B.S. in zoology and chemistry (1966) and his M.A. in biology education (1969) from the [[University of Miami]].  He received his Ph.D. in Science Education from [[The Florida State University]] in 1973. At Florida State he was mentored by Professor Dorothy M. Schlitt, known for her innovative ideas related to science teacher education. At Florida State, Penick was also significantly influenced by Professors Charles Matthews and Ron Good. While at Florida State Penick met fellow student [[James A. Shymansky]], with whom he would continue to work for many years.

==Professional career==
Following his graduation in 1973, Penick became assistant professor at [[Loyola University of Chicago]], where he taught and was Director of Teacher Education in his second year. In 1975 Penick left Loyola for the [[University of Iowa]], where his classmate, [[James A. Shymansky]], had been for two years. At Iowa, Penick was promoted to Associate Professor (1977) and Professor (1982) and eventually was named Department Chair (1982).  While at Iowa, Penick worked closely with Vincent Lunetta in developing and expanding a preservice science teacher education program, initially funded by the [[National Science Foundation]], called Iowa UPSTEP.&lt;ref&gt;Penick, J. E. and Lunetta, V. N. (Autumn, 1980). Iowa-UPSTEP: A dynamic model in science teacher education now. The Teacher Educator, 16(1), 14-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Penick, J. E. and Yager, R. E. (Nov–Dec, 1988) Science teacher education: A program with a theoretical and pragmatic rationale. Journal of Teacher Education, 39(6), 59–64&lt;/ref&gt; During Penick’s years at the University of Iowa, the department of science education was noted as being large, dynamic, and highly productive of scholarly publications and outstanding students at every level. In 1985 he was a senior [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright]] Scholar at the [[University of Lisbon]] (Portugal) and [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology|The Technion]] ([[Haifa|Haifa, Israel]]).

After more than 22 years at the University of Iowa, Penick was named Head of the Department of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education at [[North Carolina State University]]. As Department Head, Penick emphasized research productivity and hired a number of new faculty members. During his more than 10 years as Head, the value of grants obtained by his department grew significantly and his department grew in research productivity.

Following his retirement from NC State in 2009, Penick accepted a position as Director for Research and Development at [[Sangari do Brasil]], in Sao Paulo Brazil. With the creation of Sangari USA, Penick became vice president for research and development of the American subsidiary. He retired from Sangari in 2011 and currently resides in Miami Florida.

==Honors and offices==

In 1987 and again in 2015, the [[Florida State University College of Education]] presented him with the Distinguished Educator award, its highest award, for his contributions to education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.fsu.edu/alumni-and-friends/distinguished-alumni/past-recipients |title=Past Recipients &amp;#124; College of Education - FSU |website=Education.fsu.edu |date=2015-11-10 |accessdate=2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=) |url=http://fsuednews.com/2015/10/19/fsu-college-of-education-names-2015-distinguished-alumni-award-winners/ |title=FSU College of Education names 2015 Distinguished Alumni Award winners |website=FSU EdNews |date=2015-10-19 |accessdate=2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born while his father, Edgar C. Penick Jr., was stationed at Langley Virginia during WW II,  young John lived in Austin Texas prior to his family moving to Miami Florida in 1947, where, like many others, he dreamed of being the undersea explorer, Jacques Cousteau. After earning his B.S., Penick finished a year of graduate work there in Zoology before becoming a high school biology and chemistry teacher at [[Miami Jackson High School|Miami Jackson Senior High School]]. After his masters degree, Penick taught one summer at [[Miami Dade College|Miami-Dade Community College]] before being named department head at Miami Jackson. During the 1972-73 school year, he taught  high school biology at the Florida State University lab school, with Professor Dorothy Schlitt, Sharyl Bender, and Judy Lewis . A 1978 article describes the innovations they implemented during that experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Student-structured learning in biology.|last = Penick, J. E., Schlitt, D., Bender, S., and Lewis, J.|first = |date = 1975|journal = Science Education|volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=13-18|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Penick married his high school sweetheart, Nell Inman in 1966 and, after she taught English at Jackson High School for three years, they had two children, Lucas (1969) and Megan (1973).  Nell Inman Penick received her Ph.D. in Counseling and Human Development from the University of Iowa in 1990 and had a private practice for [[marriage and family therapy]] for 20 years in Iowa and North Carolina, Lucas is a private teacher and tutor, primarily in science and mathematics, in Miami and Megan is an attorney in New York City. Megan, with her husband, Yong Jae Lee, has given her parents three grandchildren, Juliet Lee (2006), Renee Lee (2008), and Lia Lee (2010).

[[File:CourtGavel.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Philosopher]]s of law ask "what is law, and what should it be?"]]

'''Jurisprudence''' or '''legal theory''' is the theoretical study of [[law]], principally by [[philosophy of law|philosophers]] but, from the twentieth century, also by [[social science|social scientists]]. Scholars of jurisprudence, also known as [[jurist]]s or legal theorists, hope to obtain a deeper understanding of [[Reason#Logical reasoning methods and argumentation|legal reasoning]], [[list of national legal systems|legal systems]], [[Law#Legal institutions|legal institutions]], and the role of law in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/jurisprudence|title=Jurisprudence|last=Staff|first=LII|date=2007-08-06|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was focused on the first principles of the [[natural law]], [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and the [[Public international law|law of nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Bryan A.|title=Black's law dictionary|year=2009|publisher=West|location=Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA|isbn=0-314-19949-7|pages=Jurisprudence entry|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt; General jurisprudence can be divided into categories both by the type of question scholars seek to answer and by the theories of jurisprudence, or schools of thought, regarding how those questions are best answered. Contemporary philosophy of law, which deals with general jurisprudence, addresses problems internal to law and legal systems, and problems of law as a particular social institution as law relates to the larger political and social situation in which it exists.&lt;ref name="Shiner"&gt;Shiner, "Philosophy of Law", ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

This article distinguishes three distinct branches of thought in general jurisprudence. To begin with, ancient [[#Natural law|natural law]], as a major branch and theory of jurisprudence, is the idea that there are rational objective limits to the power of legislative rulers. The foundations of law are accessible through reason and it is from these laws of nature that human-created laws gain whatever force they have.&lt;ref name="Shiner" /&gt; Secondly, 'clarificatory' or [[#Analytic jurisprudence|analytic jurisprudence]] rejects natural law's fusing of what law is and what it ought to be. It espouses the use of a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to aspects of legal systems.&lt;ref name="Hart_1958"/&gt; It comprises different theories of jurisprudence. For example, ''legal positivism'', holds that there is no necessary connection between law and morality and that the force of law comes from some basic social facts.&lt;ref name="Soper_CDoP"&gt;Soper, "Legal Positivism", ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; And ''legal realism'' argues that the real world practice of law is what determines what law is; the law has the force that it does because of what legislators, lawyers and judges do with it. Thirdly, [[#Normative jurisprudence|normative jurisprudence]] is concerned with "evaluative" theories of law. It deals with what the goal or purpose of law is, or what moral or political theories provide a foundation for the law. Besides the question "What is law?", it tries to answer what the proper function of law was, or what sorts of acts should be subject to legal sanctions, and what sorts of punishment should be permitted.

== Etymology ==
The English word is based on the Latin maxim ''jurisprudentia'': ''juris'' is the [[genitive]] form of ''jus'' meaning "law", and ''prudentia'' means "prudence" (also: discretion, foresight, forethought, circumspection; refers to the exercise of good judgment, common sense, and even caution, especially in the conduct of practical matters). The word is first attested in English in 1628,&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd edition 1989&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when the word ''prudence'' had the meaning of "knowledge of or skill in a matter". The word may have come via the French ''jurisprudence'', which is attested earlier.

== History ==
Ancient Indian jurisprudence is available in various [[Dharmaśāstra]] texts starting from the Dharmasutra of Bhodhayana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bhu.ac.in/mmak/resent_article/JusticeKatjusLec.pdf|title=ANCIENT INDIAN JURISPRUDENCE|first=Markandey|last=Katju|year=2010|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jurisprudence already had this meaning{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} in [[Ancient Rome]] even if at its origins the discipline was a (''periti'') in the ''[[Ius|jus]]'' of ''[[mos maiorum]]'' (traditional law), a body of [[oral law]]s and customs verbally transmitted "by father to son". Praetors established a workable body of laws by judging whether or not singular cases were capable of being prosecuted either by the edicta, the annual pronunciation of prosecutable offense, or in extraordinary situations, additions made to the edicta. An iudex then would judge a remedy according to the facts of the case.

Their sentences were supposed to be simple interpretations of the traditional customs, but effectively it was an activity that, apart from formally reconsidering for each case what precisely was traditionally in the legal habits, soon turned also to a more equitable interpretation, coherently adapting the law to the newer social instances. The law was then implemented with new evolutive ''Institutiones'' (legal concepts), while remaining in the traditional scheme. Praetors were replaced in the 3rd century BC by a laical body of ''prudentes''. Admission to this body was conditional upon proof of competence or experience.

Under the [[Roman Empire]], schools of law were created, and the activity constantly became more academic. In the age from the early Roman Empire to the 3rd century, a relevant literature was produced by some notable groups including the Proculians and [[Sabinians]]. The scientific depth of the studies was unprecedented in ancient times.

After the 3rd century, ''Juris prudentia'' became a more bureaucratic activity, with few notable authors. It was during the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (5th century) that legal studies were once again undertaken in depth, and it is from this cultural movement that [[Justinian I|Justinian]]'s [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] was born.

=={{Anchor|Natural law}}Natural law==
In its general context, natural law theory may be compared to both state-of-nature law and general law understood on the basis of an analogy to the physical laws of science. Natural law is often contrasted to positive law which asserts law as the product of human activity and human volition.

Another approach to natural law jurisprudence generally asserts that human law may be supported by decisive reasons for action. In other words, there must be a compelling rationale behind following human law. There are two readings of the natural law jurisprudential stance.
# '''The Strong Natural Law Thesis''' holds that if a human law fails to be backed-up by decisive reasons, then it is not properly called a "law" at all. This is captured, imperfectly, in the famous maxim: ''[[Lex iniusta non est lex|lex iniusta non est lex']] (an unjust law is no law at all).'' 
# '''The Weak Natural Law Thesis''' holds that if a human law fails to be backed-up by decisive reasons, then it can still be called a "law", but it must be recognised as a defective law. 
Notions of an objective moral order, external to human legal systems, underlie natural law. What is right or wrong can vary according to the interests one is focused upon. Natural law is sometimes identified with the maxim that "an unjust law is no law at all", but as [[John Finnis]], the most important of modern natural barristers{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} has argued, this maxim is a poor guide to the classical [[Thomism|Thomist]] position. Strongly related to theories of natural law are classical theories of [[justice]], beginning in the West with [[Plato]]'s [[Plato Republic|Republic]].

===Aristotle===
[[File:Francesco Hayez 001.jpg|thumb|[[Aristotle]], by [[Francesco Hayez]]]]
Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law.&lt;ref&gt;Shellens, "Aristotle on Natural Law."&lt;/ref&gt; Like his philosophical forefathers [[Socrates]] and Plato, Aristotle posited the existence of [[natural justice]] or natural right (''dikaion physikon'', ''δικαίον φυσικόν'', [[Latin]] ''[[ius naturale]]''). His association with natural law is largely due to the way in which he was interpreted by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa, ''Thomism and Aristotelianism''.&lt;/ref&gt; This was based on Aquinas' conflation of natural law and natural right, the latter of which Aristotle posits in Book V of the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (= Book IV of the ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]''). Aquinas's influence was such as to affect a number of early translations of these passages,&lt;ref&gt;H. Rackham, trans., ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Loeb Classical Library; J. A. K. Thomson, trans. (revised by Hugh Tedennick), ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Penguin Classics.&lt;/ref&gt; though more recent translations render them more literally.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Sachs, trans., ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Focus Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's theory of justice is bound up in his idea of the [[golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]]. Indeed, his treatment of what he calls "political justice" derives from his discussion of "the just" as a moral virtue derived as the mean between opposing vices, just like every other virtue he describes.&lt;ref&gt;"Nicomachean Ethics" Bk. II ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt; His longest discussion of his theory of justice occurs in ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and begins by asking what sort of mean a just act is. He argues that the term "justice" actually refers to two different but related ideas: general justice and particular justice.&lt;ref&gt;Terrence Irwin, trans. ''Nicomachean Ethics, 2nd Ed.'', Hackett Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Nicomachean Ethics'', Bk. V, ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt; When a person's actions are completely virtuous in all matters in relation to others, Aristotle calls them "just" in the sense of "general justice;" as such this idea of justice is more or less coextensive with virtue.&lt;ref&gt;"Nicomachean Ethics", Bk. V, ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt; "Particular" or "partial justice", by contrast, is the part of "general justice" or the individual virtue that is concerned with treating others equitably.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Aristotle moves from this unqualified discussion of justice to a qualified view of political justice, by which he means something close to the subject of modern jurisprudence. Of political justice, Aristotle argues that it is partly derived from nature and partly a matter of convention.&lt;ref&gt;''Nicomachean Ethics'', Bk. V, ch. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be taken as a statement that is similar to the views of modern natural law theorists. But it must also be remembered that Aristotle is describing a view of morality, not a system of law, and therefore his remarks as to nature are about the grounding of the morality enacted as law, not the laws themselves. The passage here is silent as to that question.

The best evidence of Aristotle's having thought there was a natural law comes from the ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', where Aristotle notes that, aside from the "particular" laws that each people has set up for itself, there is a "common" law that is according to nature.&lt;ref&gt;''Rhetoric'' 1373b2–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The context of this remark, however, suggests only that Aristotle thought that it could be rhetorically advantageous to appeal to such a law, especially when the "particular" law of one's own city was adverse to the case being made, not that there actually was such a law;&lt;ref&gt;Shellens, "Aristotle on Natural Law," 75–81&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle, moreover, considered two of the three candidates for a universally valid, natural law suggested in this passage to be wrong.&lt;ref&gt;"Natural Law," ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's theoretical paternity of the natural law tradition is consequently disputed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Thomas Aquinas===
[[File:St-thomas-aquinas.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Aquinas]] was the most influential Western medieval legal [[scholar]]]]
{{Main|Thomas Aquinas}}
Thomas Aquinas, [Thomas of Aquin, or Aquino] (c. 1225 – 7 March 1274) was an Italian philosopher and theologian in the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition, known as "Doctor Angelicus, Doctor Universalis". He is the foremost classical proponent of [[natural theology]], and the father of the Thomistic school of philosophy, for a long time the primary philosophical approach of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The work for which he is best known is the ''[[Summa Theologica]]''. One of the thirty-five [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]], he is considered by many Catholics to be the Church's greatest theologian. Consequently, many [[Institutions named after Thomas Aquinas|institutions of learning]] have been named after him.

Aquinas distinguished four kinds of law: eternal, natural, human and divine:

* Eternal law refers to divine reason, known only to God. It is God's plan for the universe. Man needs this, for without it he would totally lack direction.
* Natural law is the "participation" in the eternal law by rational human creatures, and is discovered by reason.
* [[Divine law]] is revealed in the scriptures and is God's positive law for mankind.
* [[Human law]] is supported by reason and enacted for the common good.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Pojman]], ''Ethics'' ([[Belmont, California|Belmont]], [[California|CA]]: Wadsworth Publishing Company, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural law, of course, is based on "first principles":

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...&amp;nbsp;this is the first precept of the law, that good is to be done and promoted, and evil is to be avoided. All other precepts of the natural law are based on this&amp;nbsp;...''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/FS/FS094.html#FSQ94A2THEP1|title=Summa Theologica|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The desires to live and to procreate are counted by Aquinas among those basic (natural) human values on which all other human values are based.

===School of Salamanca===
{{Main|School of Salamanca|ius gentium}}
[[Francisco de Vitoria]] was perhaps the first to develop a theory of ''[[ius gentium]]'' (the rights of peoples), and thus is an important figure in the transition to modernity. He extrapolated his ideas of legitimate sovereign power to society at the international level, concluding that this scope as well ought to be ruled by just forms respectable of the rights of all. The common good of the world is of a category superior to the good of each state. This meant that relations between states ought to pass from being justified by force to being justified by law and justice. Some scholars have upset the standard account of the origins of International law, which emphasises the seminal text ''De iure belli ac pacis'' by Grotius, and argued for Vitoria and, later, Suárez's importance as forerunners and, potentially, founders of the field.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. James Brown Scott, cited in Cavallar, The Rights of Strangers: theories of international hospitality, the global community, and political justice since Vitoria, p.164&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Koskenniemi, have argued that none of these humanist and scholastic thinkers can be understood to have founded international law in the modern sense, instead placing its origins in the post-1870 period.&lt;ref&gt;Koskenniemi: International Law and raison d'état: Rethinking the Prehistory of International Law in Kingsbury &amp; Strausmann, The Roman Foundations of the Law of Nations, p. 297–339&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francisco Suárez]], regarded as among the greatest scholastics after Aquinas, subdivided the concept of ''ius gentium''. Working with already well-formed categories, he carefully distinguished ''ius inter gentes'' from ''ius intra gentes''. ''Ius inter gentes'' (which corresponds to modern international law) was something common to the majority of countries, although, being positive law, not natural law, was not necessarily universal. On the other hand, ''ius intra gentes'', or civil law, is specific to each nation.

===Thomas Hobbes===
{{Main|Thomas Hobbes}}
In his treatise ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan, (1651)]]'', Hobbes expresses a view of natural law as a [[precept]], or general rule, found out by [[reason]], by which a man is forbidden to do that which is destructive of his life, or takes away the means of preserving the same; and to omit that by which he thinks it may best be preserved. Hobbes was a [[social contract]]arian&lt;ref&gt;Basically meaning: the people of a society are prepared give up some rights to a government in order to receive social order.&lt;/ref&gt; and believed that the law gained peoples' tacit consent. He believed that society was formed from a [[state of nature]] to protect people from the state of war between mankind that exists otherwise. Life is, without an ordered society, "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short". It is commonly commented that Hobbes' views about the core of human nature were influenced by his times. The [[English Civil War]] and the Cromwellian dictatorship had taken place, and he felt absolute authority vested in a monarch, whose subjects obeyed the law, was the basis of a civilized society.

===Lon Fuller===
{{Main|Lon L. Fuller}}
Writing after [[World War II]], Lon L. Fuller defended a secular and procedural form of natural law. He notably emphasised that the (natural) law must meet certain formal requirements (such as being impartial and publicly knowable). To the extent that an institutional system of social control falls short of these requirements, Fuller argues, we are less inclined to recognise it as a system of law, or to give it our respect. Thus, law has an internal morality that goes beyond the social rules by which valid laws are made.

===John Finnis===
{{Main|John Finnis}}
Sophisticated positivist and natural law theories sometimes resemble each other more than the above descriptions might suggest, and they may concede certain points to the other "side". Identifying a particular theorist as a positivist or a natural law theorist sometimes involves matters of emphasis and degree, and the particular influences on the theorist's work. In particular, the older natural lawyers, such as Aquinas and John Locke made no distinction between analytic and normative jurisprudence. But modern natural lawyers, such as John Finnis claim to be positivists, while still arguing that law is a basically moral creature. His book ''[[Natural Law and Natural Rights]]'' (1980, 2011) is a restatement of natural law doctrine.

=={{Anchor|Analytic jurisprudence}}Analytic jurisprudence==
{{Main|Analytic jurisprudence}}

Analytic, or 'clarificatory', jurisprudence means the use of a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to the aspects of legal systems. This was a philosophical development that rejected natural law's fusing of what law is and what it ought to be.&lt;ref name="Hart_1958"&gt;See H L A Hart, 'Positivism and the Separation of Law and Morals' (1958) 71 ''Harv. L. Rev.'' 593&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hume]] famously argued in ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]''&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' (1739) [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/h/hume/david/h92t/ Etext] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820100015/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/h/hume/david/h92t/ |date=20 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that people invariably slip between describing that the world ''is'' a certain way to saying therefore we ''ought'' to conclude on a particular course of action. But as a matter of pure logic, one cannot conclude that we ''ought'' to do something merely because something ''is'' the case. So analysing and clarifying the way the world ''is'' must be treated as a strictly separate question to normative and evaluative ''ought'' questions.

The most important questions of analytic jurisprudence are: "What are laws?"; "What is ''the'' law?"; "What is the relationship between law and power/sociology?"; and "What is the relationship between law and morality?" Legal positivism is the dominant theory, although there are a growing number of critics who offer their own interpretations.

===Historical School===
Historical jurisprudence came to prominence during the German debate over the proposed codification of German law. In his book ''On the Vocation of Our Age for Legislation and Jurisprudence'',&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Carl von Savigny, ''On the Vocation of Our Age for Legislation and Jurisprudence'' (Abraham A. Hayward trans., 1831)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] argued that Germany did not have a legal language that would support codification because the traditions, customs and beliefs of the German people did not include a belief in a code. The Historicists believe that the law originates with society.

===Sociological Jurisprudence===
{{Main|Sociology of Law}}
The effort to inform jurisprudence systematically with sociological insights developed strongly from the beginning of the twentieth century, as sociology began to establish itself as a distinct social science, especially in the United States and in continental Europe. In Germany the work of the 'free law' theorists (e.g. Ernst Fuchs, [[Hermann Kantorowicz]] and [[Eugen Ehrlich]]) encouraged the use of sociological insights in judicial development of law and juristic theory. The most internationally influential advocacy of a 'sociological jurisprudence' occurred in the United States, where [[Roscoe Pound]], for many years the Dean of Harvard Law School, used this term to characterise his legal philosophy throughout the first half of the twentieth century. In the United States many later writers followed Pound's lead or developed distinctive approaches to sociological jurisprudence. In Australia, [[Julius Stone]] strongly defended and developed Pound's ideas.  In the 1930s a significant split between the sociological jurists and the American legal realists emerged. In the second half of the twentieth century sociological jurisprudence as a distinct movement declined as jurisprudence came more strongly under the influence of analytical legal philosophy but with increasing criticism of dominant orientations of Anglophone legal philosophy in the present century it has attracted renewed interest.

===Legal positivism===
{{Main|Legal positivism}}
Positivism simply means that law is something that is "posited": laws are validly made in accordance with socially accepted rules. The positivist view on law can be seen to cover two broad principles: Firstly, that laws may seek to enforce justice, morality, or any other normative end, but their success or failure in doing so does not determine their validity. Provided a law is properly formed, in accordance with the rules recognized in the society concerned, it is a valid law, regardless of whether it is ''just'' by some other standard. Secondly, that law is nothing more than a set of rules to provide order and governance of society. No legal positivist, however, argues that it follows that the law is therefore to be obeyed, no matter what. This is seen as a separate question entirely.
* What the law ''is'' ([[lex lata]]) - is determined by historical social practice (resulting in rules)
* What the law ''ought to be'' ([[lex ferenda]]) - is determined by moral considerations.

====Bentham and Austin====
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham's]] utilitarian theories remained dominant in law until the twentieth century]]
{{Main|Jeremy Bentham|John Austin (legal philosopher)}}
One of the earliest legal positivists was Jeremy Bentham. Bentham was an early and staunch supporter of the utilitarian concept (along with Hume), an avid prison reformer, advocate for [[democracy]], and strong [[atheist]]. Bentham's views about law and jurisprudence were popularized by his student, [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]]. Austin was the first chair of law at the new [[University of London]] from 1829. Austin's [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] answer to "what is law?" was that law is "commands, backed by threat of sanctions, from a sovereign, to whom people have a habit of obedience".&lt;ref&gt;John Austin, ''The Providence of Jurisprudence Determined'' (1831)&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary legal positivists have long abandoned this view, and have criticised its oversimplification, H. L. A. Hart particularly.

====Hans Kelsen====
{{Main|Hans Kelsen}}
Hans Kelsen is considered one of the prominent jurists of the 20th century and has been highly influential in Europe and Latin America, although less so in common-law countries. His [[Pure Theory of Law]] aims to describe law as binding norms while at the same time refusing, itself, to evaluate those norms. That is, 'legal science' is to be separated from 'legal politics'. Central to the Pure Theory of Law is the notion of a 'basic norm ([[Grundnorm]])'—a hypothetical norm, presupposed by the jurist, from which in a hierarchy all 'lower' norms in a [[legal system]], beginning with [[constitutional law]], are understood to derive their authority or 'bindingness'. In this way, Kelsen contends, the bindingness of legal norms, their specifically 'legal' character, can be understood without tracing it ultimately to some suprahuman source such as God, personified Nature or—of great importance in his time—a personified State or Nation.

====H. L. A. Hart====
{{Main|H. L. A. Hart}}
In the Anglophone world, the pivotal writer was [[H. L. A. Hart]], who argued that the law should be understood as a system of social rules. Hart rejected Kelsen's views that sanctions were essential to law and that a normative social phenomenon, like law, can not be grounded in non-normative social facts. Hart revived analytical jurisprudence as an important theoretical debate in the twentieth century through his book ''[[The Concept of Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;H. L. A. Hart, ''The Concept of Law'' (1961) Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-876122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the professor of jurisprudence at [[Oxford University]], Hart argued that law is a 'system of rules'.

Rules, said Hart, are divided into primary rules (rules of conduct) and secondary rules (rules addressed to officials to administer primary rules). Secondary rules are divided into rules of adjudication (to resolve legal disputes), rules of change (allowing laws to be varied) and the rule of recognition (allowing laws to be identified as valid). The "rule of recognition" is a customary practice of the officials (especially barristers and judges) that identifies certain acts and decisions as sources of law. A pivotal book on Hart was written by Neil MacCormick&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/staff/neilmaccormick_51.aspx |title=The University of Edinburgh |access-date=24 May 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601221401/http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/staff/neilmaccormick_51.aspx |archive-date=1 June 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1981 (second edition due in 2007), which further refined and offered some important criticisms that led MacCormick to develop his own theory (the best example of which is his recently published ''Institutions of Law'', 2007). Other important critiques have included that of Ronald Dworkin, John Finnis, and [[Joseph Raz]].

In recent years, debates about the nature of law have become increasingly fine-grained. One important debate is within legal positivism. One school is sometimes called ''exclusive legal positivism'', and it is associated with the view that the legal validity of a norm can never depend on its moral correctness. A second school is labeled ''inclusive legal positivism'', a major proponent of which is Wil Waluchow, and it is associated with the view that moral considerations ''may'' determine the legal validity of a norm, but that it is not necessary that this is the case.

====Joseph Raz====
{{Main|Joseph Raz}}
Some philosophers used to contend that positivism was the theory that there is "no necessary connection" between law and morality; but influential contemporary positivists, including Joseph Raz, John Gardner, and Leslie Green, reject that view. As Raz points out, it is a necessary truth that there are vices that a legal system cannot possibly have (for example, it cannot commit rape or murder).

Joseph Raz defends the positivist outlook, but criticised Hart's "soft social thesis" approach in ''The Authority of Law''.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Raz, ''The Authority of Law'' (1979) Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Raz argues that law is authority, identifiable purely through social sources, without reference to moral reasoning. Any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authority is better left to sociology than to jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;ch. 2, Joseph Raz, ''The Authority of Law'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal realism===
[[File:Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr circa 1930-edit.jpg|right|thumb|[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] was a self-styled legal realist]]
{{Main|Legal realism}}
Legal realism was a view popular with some Scandinavian and American writers. Skeptical in tone, it held that the law should be understood and determined by the actual practices of courts, law offices, and police stations, rather than as the rules and doctrines set forth in statutes or learned treatises. It had some affinities with the sociology of law and sociological jurisprudence. The essential tenet of legal realism is that all law is made by human beings and, thus, is subject to human foibles, frailties and imperfections.

It has become common today to identify Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., as the main precursor of American Legal Realism (other influences include [[Roscoe Pound]], [[Karl N. Llewellyn|Karl Llewellyn]] and Justice [[Benjamin N. Cardozo|Benjamin Cardozo]]). Karl Llewellyn, another founder of the U.S. legal realism movement, similarly believed that the law is little more than putty in the hands of judges who are able to shape the outcome of cases based on their personal values or policy choices.&lt;ref&gt;"Jurisprudence". West's Encyclopedia of American Law. Ed. Jeffrey Lehman, Shirelle
Phelps. Detroit: Thomson/Gale, 2005.
&lt;/ref&gt; The chief inspiration for Scandinavian legal realism many consider to be the works of [[Axel Hägerström]].

Despite its decline in popularity, realism continues to influence a wide spectrum of jurisprudential schools today, including [[critical legal studies]], [[feminist legal theory]], [[critical race theory]], [[sociology of law]] and [[law and economics]].&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;[[Kristoffel Grechenig]] &amp; Martin Gelter, The Transatlantic Divergence in Legal Thought: American Law and Economics vs. German Doctrinalism, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1161168 ''Hastings International and Comparative Law Review 2008, vol. 31, p. 295–360''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Critical legal studies====
[[Critical legal studies]] are a younger theory of jurisprudence that has developed since the 1970s. It can be generally traced to American legal realism and is considered "the first movement in legal theory and legal scholarship in the United States to have espoused a committed Left political stance and perspective".&lt;ref name = Hunt86&gt;Alan Hunt, "The Theory of Critical Legal Studies," Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, Vol. 6, No. 1 (1986): 1-45, esp. 1, 5. See [http://ojls.oxfordjournals.org/content/6/1/1.extract]. DOI, 10.1093/ojls/6.1.1.&lt;/ref&gt; It holds that the law is largely contradictory, and can be best analyzed as an expression of the policy goals of a dominant social group.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, "Critical Legal Studies", ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical rationalism===
[[Karl Popper]] originated the theory of [[Jurisprudence#critical rationalism|critical rationalism]]. According to [[Reinhold Zippelius]] many advances in law and jurisprudence take place by operations of critical rationalism. He writes, "daß die Suche nach dem Begriff des Rechts, nach seinen Bezügen zur Wirklichkeit und nach der Gerechtigkeit experimentierend voranschreitet, indem wir Problemlösungen versuchsweise entwerfen, überprüfen und verbessern" (that we empirically search solutions of problems, which harmonise fair with the reality: by projecting, testing and improving the solutions).&lt;ref&gt;Reinhold Zippelius, Rechtsphilosophie, 6. Aufl. 2011 Vorwort.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal interpretivism===
{{Main|Interpretivism (legal)}}

Contemporary philosopher of law [[Ronald Dworkin]] has advocated a more constructivist theory of jurisprudence that can be characterized as a middle path between natural law theories and positivist theories of general jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, "Review of Dworkin and His Critics with Replies by Dworkin", ''Modern Law Review'', vol. 69 no. 6&lt;/ref&gt; 
In his book ''[[Law's Empire]]''&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Dworkin, ''Law's Empire'' (1986) [[Harvard University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; Dworkin attacked [[H. L. A. Hart|Hart]] and the positivists for their refusal to treat law as a moral issue. He argues that law is an 'interpretive' concept, that requires barristers to find the best-fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their constitutional traditions. According to him, law is not entirely based on social facts, but includes the morally best justification for the institutional facts and practices that we intuitively regard as legal. It follows on Dworkin's view that one cannot know whether a society has a legal system in force, or what any of its laws are, until one knows some moral truths about the justifications for the practices in that society. It is consistent with Dworkin's view—in contrast with the views of legal positivists or legal realists—that ''no-one'' in a society may know what its laws are, because no-one may know the best justification for its practices.

Interpretation, according to Dworkin's ''integrity theory of law'', has two dimensions. To count as an interpretation, the reading of a text must meet the criterion of ''fit''. Of those interpretations that fit, however, Dworkin maintains that the correct interpretation is the one that puts the political practices of the community in their best light, or makes of them ''the best that they can be''. But many writers have doubted whether there ''is'' a single best justification for the complex practices of any given community, and others have doubted whether, even if there are, they should be counted as part of the law of that community.

===Therapeutic jurisprudence===
{{Main|Therapeutic jurisprudence}}

Consequences from the operation of legal rules or legal procedures—or from the behavior of legal actors (such as lawyers and judges)—may be either beneficial (therapeutic) or harmful (anti-therapeutic) to people. [[Therapeutic jurisprudence]] ("TJ") studies law as a social force (or agent) and uses [[social science]] methods and data to study the extent to which a legal rule or practice affects the psychological well-being of the people it affects.&lt;ref&gt;David B Wexler, Michael L Perlin, Michel Vols et al. 'Editorial: Current Issues in Therapeutic Jurisprudence' (2016) 16(3) ''QUT Law Review'' pp. 1-3. ISSN: Online- 2201-7275 https://lr.law.qut.edu.au/article/view/692/616&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{Anchor|Normative jurisprudence}}Normative jurisprudence==
{{Main|Political philosophy}}

In addition to the question, "What is law?", legal philosophy is also concerned with normative, or "evaluative" theories of law. What is the goal or purpose of law? What moral or political theories provide a foundation for the law? What is the proper function of law? What sorts of acts should be subject to [[sanctions (law)|punishment]], and what sorts of punishment should be permitted? What is justice? What rights do we have? Is there a duty to obey the law? What value has the rule of law? Some of the different schools and leading thinkers are as follows.

===Virtue jurisprudence===
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Plato]] (left) and [[Aristotle]] (right), a detail of ''[[The School of Athens]]'']]
{{Main|Virtue jurisprudence}}
Aretaic moral theories such as contemporary [[virtue ethics]] emphasize the role of character in morality. Virtue jurisprudence is the view that the laws should promote the development of virtuous characters by citizens. Historically, this approach is associated mainly with Aristotle or Thomas Aquinas later. Contemporary virtue jurisprudence is inspired by philosophical work on virtue ethics.

===Deontology===
{{Main|Deontological ethics}}
Deontology is "the theory of duty or moral obligation."&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language, p. 378 (2d Coll. Ed. 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] formulated one influential deontological theory of law. He argued that any rule we follow must be able to be universally applied, i.e. we must be willing for everyone to follow that rule. A contemporary deontological approach can be found in the work of the legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin.

===Utilitarianism===
[[File:JohnStuartMill.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] believed law should create happiness]]
{{Main|Utilitarianism}}
{{See also|Lysander Spooner}}
Utilitarianism is the view that the laws should be crafted so as to produce the best consequences for the greatest number of people possible. Historically, utilitarian thinking about law is associated with the philosopher Jeremy Bentham. John Stuart Mill was a pupil of Bentham's and was the torch bearer for [[Utilitarianism (book)|utilitarian]] philosophy through the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;see, [http://metalibri.incubadora.fapesp.br/portal/authors/m/john-stuart-mill/utilitarianism/ Utilitarianism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505231025/http://metalibri.incubadora.fapesp.br/portal/authors/m/john-stuart-mill/utilitarianism/ |date=5 May 2007 }} at Metalibri Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary legal theory, the utilitarian approach is frequently championed by scholars who work in the law and economics tradition.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;

===John Rawls===
{{Main|John Rawls|A Theory of Justice}}
John Rawls was an [[United States|American]] philosopher, a [[professor]] of [[political philosophy]] at [[Harvard University]] and author of ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' (1971), ''[[Political Liberalism]]'', ''[[Justice as Fairness: A Restatement]]'', and ''[[The Law of Peoples]]''. He is widely considered one of the most important English-language political philosophers of the 20th century. His theory of justice uses a device called the original position to ask us which principles of justice we would choose to regulate the basic institutions of our society if we were behind a 'veil of ignorance.' Imagine we do not know who we are - our race, sex, wealth status, class, or any distinguishing feature - so that we would not be biased in our own favour. Rawls argues from this 'original position' that we would choose exactly the same political liberties for everyone, like freedom of speech, the right to vote and so on. Also, we would choose a system where there is only inequality because that produces incentives enough for the economic well-being of all society, especially the poorest. This is Rawls's famous 'difference principle'. Justice is fairness, in the sense that the fairness of the original position of choice guarantees the fairness of the principles chosen in that position.

There are many other normative approaches to the philosophy of law, including critical legal studies and [[libertarian theories of law]].

'''Large marine ecosystems (LMEs)''' are regions of the world's [[ocean]]s, encompassing coastal areas from river basins and [[estuary|estuaries]] to the seaward boundaries of [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] and the outer margins of the major [[ocean current]] systems. They are relatively large regions on the order of 200,000&amp;nbsp;km² or greater, characterized by distinct [[bathymetry]], [[hydrography]], [[primary production|productivity]], and [[trophic level|trophically]] dependent [[population]]s. Productivity in LME protected areas is generally higher than in the open ocean.

The system of LMEs has been developed by the US [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) to identify areas of the oceans for conservation purposes. The objective is to use the LME concept as a tool for enabling [[ecosystem-based management]] to provide a collaborative approach to management of resources within ecologically-bounded transnational areas. This will be done in an international context and consistent with customary international law as reflected in 1982 [[United Nations|UN]] [[Convention on the Law of the Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lme.noaa.gov NOAA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the LMEs cover mostly the continental margins and not the deep oceans and oceanic islands, the 66 LMEs produce about 80% of global annual marine fishery [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lme.noaa.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1:lme-introduction&amp;catid=14&amp;Itemid=112|title=LME Introduction|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, LMEs contribute $12.6 trillion&lt;ref&gt;Costanza R, d'Arge R, Groots Rd, Farber S, Grasso M, Hannon B, Limburg K, Naeem S, O'Neill RV, Paruelo J and others. 1997. The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital. Nature 387:253-260.&lt;/ref&gt; in goods and services each year to the global economy. Due to their close proximity to developed coastlines, LMEs are in danger of [[ocean pollution]], [[overexploitation]], and coastal habitat alteration. NOAA has conducted studies of principal driving forces affecting changes in biomass yields for 33 of the 66 LMEs, which have been peer-reviewed and published in ten volumes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lme.noaa.gov NOAA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

LME-based conservation is based on recognition that the world’s coastal ocean waters are degraded by unsustainable fishing practices, [[habitat degradation]], [[eutrophication]], toxic pollution, aerosol contamination, and emerging diseases, and that positive actions to mitigate these threats require coordinated actions by governments and civil society to recover depleted fish populations, restore degraded habitats and reduce coastal pollution. Five modules are considered when assessing LMEs: productivity, fish and fisheries, pollution and ecosystem health, socioeconomics, and governance.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen SB, Sutinen JG, Juda L, Hennessey TM, Grigalunas TA. 2006. A Handbook on Governance and Socioeconomics of Large Marine Ecosystems. Kingston, RI: Coastal Resources     Center, University of Rhode Island. 94 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Periodically assessing the state of each module within a marine LME is encouraged to ensure maintained health of the ecosystem and future benefit to managing governments.&lt;ref&gt;Wang H. 2004. An evaluation of the modular approach to the assessment and management of large marine ecosystems. Ocean Development and International Law 35:267-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modules of Ecosystem Condition ==

=== Productivity ===

The productivity of a marine ecosystem can be measured in several ways. Measurements pertaining to zooplankton biodiversity and species composition, zooplankton biomass, water-column structure, photosynthetically active radiation, transparency, chlorophyll-a, nitrate, and primary production are used to assess changes in LME productivity and potential fisheries yield.&lt;ref&gt;Pauly D, Christensen V. 1995. Primary production required to sustain global fisheries. Nature 374:255-257.&lt;/ref&gt; Sensors attached to the bottom of ships or deployed on floats can measure these metrics and be used to quantitatively describe changes in productivity alongside physical changes in the water column such as temperature and salinity.&lt;ref&gt;Aiken J, Pollard R, Williams R, Griffiths G, Bellan I. 1999. Measurements of the upper ocean structure using towed profiling systems. In: Sherman K, Tang Q, editors. Large marine ecosystems of the Pacific Rim: Assessment, sustainability, and management. Malden, MA: Blackwell Science, Inc. p 346-362.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berman MS, Sherman K. 2001. A towed body sampler for monitoring marine ecosystems. Sea Technology 42(9):48-52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SAHFOS. 2008. Annual Report 2007. Plymouth, UK: The Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science.&lt;/ref&gt; This data can be used in conjunction with satellite measurements of chlorophyll and sea surface temperatures to validate measurements and observe trends on greater spatial and temporal scales.

=== Fish and Fisheries ===

Bottom-trawl surveys and pelagic-species acoustic surveys are used to assess changes in fish biodiversity and abundance in LMEs. Fish populations can be surveyed for stock identification, length, stomach content, age-growth relationships, fecundity, coastal pollution and associated pathological conditions, as well as multispecies trophic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Sea Around Us Project at www.seaaroundus.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Fish trawls can also collect sediment and inform us about ocean-bottom conditions such as anoxia.

=== Pollution and Ecosystem Health ===

Pollution and eutrophication can have significant impacts on ecosystem health and result in changing biomass yields. LMEs are emplaced in an effort to maintain healthy and sustainable conditions in spite of environmental change and global warming. A health ecosystem should maintain a relatively constant metabolic activity level, internal structure and organization, making it resistant to change over time.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza R. 1992. Toward an operational definition of ecosystem health. In: Costanza R, Norton BG, Haskell BD, editors. Ecosystem health: New goals for environmental management. Washington, DC: Island Press. p 239-256.&lt;/ref&gt; Health is assessed on both a population and species level. Observations are made pertaining to bioaccumulation of contaminants, frequency of harmful algal blooms and diseases, water column contents and water quality, reproductive capacity and more.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman B. 2000. Marine ecosystem health as an expression of morbidity, mortality, and disease events. Marine Pollution Bulletin 41(1-6):232-54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sherman BH. 2001. Assessment of multiple marine ecological disturbances: Applying the North American prototype to the Baltic Sea Ecosystem. Human and Ecological Risk Assessment 7(5):1519-1540.&lt;/ref&gt;  Eutrophication and nutrient overloading can be measured as a function of nitrogen and phosphate in a given location.&lt;ref&gt;Seitzinger S, Sherman K, Lee R. 2008. Filling Gaps in LME Nitrogen Loadings Forecast for 64 LMEs, Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Technical Series 79. Paris, France: UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socioeconomic ===

By integrating socioeconomic metrics with ecosystem management solutions, scientific findings can be utilized to benefit both the environment and economy of local regions. Management efforts must be practical and cost-effective. The Department of Natural Resource Economics at the University of Rhode Island has created a method for measuring and understanding the human dimensions of LMEs and for taking into consideration both socioeconomic and environmental costs and benefits of managing Large Marine Ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Sutinen J, ed. 2000. A framework for monitoring and assessing socioeconomics and governance of large marine ecosystems. NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS-NE-158:32p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutinen, J.G. , P. Clay, C.L.

A framework for monitoring and assessing socioeconomics and governance of large marine ecosystems. 27-81 In, Hennessey, T.M. and J.G. Sutinen (Editors), Sustaining Large Marine Ecosystems: The human dimension. Elsevier.368p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duda, A.M.. 2005.Targeting development assistance to meet WSSD goals for large marine ecosystems and small island developing states. Ocean &amp; Coastal Management 48:1014&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially important in island nations and small states which depend heavily on fisheries production for income.

=== Governance  ===

[[File:Global map of large marine ecosystems.jpg|thumb|Global map of large marine ecosystems. Oceanographers and biologists have identified 66 LMEs worldwide.]]The Global Environment Facility (GEF)  aids in managing LMEs off the coasts of Africa and Asia by creating resource management agreements between environmental, fisheries, energy and tourism ministers of bordering countries. This means participating countries share knowledge and resources pertaining to local LMEs to promote longevity and recovery of fisheries and other industries dependent upon LMEs.&lt;ref&gt;Juda L, Hennessey T. 2001.

[[File:Lasse Nordlund by Marko Ulvila 2016-06-19.jpg|thumb|Lasse Nordlund summer 2016]]

'''Lasse Nordlund''' (1965) is a Finnish social thinker who is known for his experiment of living completely self-sufficiently in the Finnish countryside, producing his clothes and tools and cultivating his food from his small farm and what he gathered from the surrounding country.

==History==
Born in [[Helsinki]] to a Finnish father and a German mother,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://suomenkuvalehti.fi/jutut/kotimaa/lantun-varassa/ |title=Hän elää luontaistaloudessa – ei omaisuutta, syö toista kiloa lanttua päivässä |website=[[Suomen Kuvalehti|Suomenkuvalehti.fi]] |access-date=November 26, 2017 |url-access=subscription |language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nordlund spent a typical youth in Germany and was interested in studying physics. However, he began to doubt the viability and meaning of conventional living and decided to try and live a self-sufficient lifestyle.

The background to Nordlund's experiment is his conviction that only [[Subsistence economy|subsistence living]] is materially sustainable on a long-term basis.

==The Experiment==

Nordlund could not, by his own admission, distinguish between a [[pine]] or a [[fir]] tree when he started his project, but started by studying books and experimenting to produce goods and obtain food. Eventually, he was able to live in [[Valtimo]], in [[North Karelia|Finnish North Karelia]], for the years between 1992 and 2004 in complete self-sufficiency.

According to Nordlund, one person needs about five [[Are (unit)|ares]] (500m²) of farmland to live on without buying any additional food. The most important food crop for him is the [[rutabaga]], a common Finnish staple. In his self-sufficient economy, Nordlund consumes 200&amp;nbsp;kg of mushrooms per year and about the same in berries preserved without additives or sugar. He forsook livestock because he projected the maintenance for example, animal feed) to be too time-consuming to make sense. Though he does accept the value of animal husbandry as wool and leather are handy clothing materials able to outlast cotton cloth. Nordlund became accustommed to life without salt, though many believe it to be life-threatening. He argues that he has been able to live without salt for years, although initially leaving out salt caused him some health issues. Instead of toilet paper, he uses dried [[sphagnum|sphagnum moss]]. In the early years of self-reliance, Nordlund's days were full of work, but eventually he was able to relax and take up hobbies from his youth, such as [[flute]] playing and working on equations.

==Recent==
He is an author and a speaker on sustainability topics.

Today, he lives with his family, still mostly self-sufficiently.

In 2008, Palladium books published a work written by Lasse Nordlund and Maria Dorff "The Foundations of Our Life, Reflections about Human labour, Money and Energy from Self-sufficiency Standpoint".

'''Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory''' ('''LBNL'''), commonly referred to as '''Berkeley Lab''', is a [[United States Department of Energy National Labs|United States national laboratory]] located in the [[Berkeley Hills]] near [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]] that conducts scientific research on behalf of the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE). It is managed and operated by the [[University of California]]. The laboratory overlooks the [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s main campus.

==History==
The laboratory was founded in August 26, 1931 by [[Ernest Lawrence]] as the '''Radiation Laboratory''' of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] associated with the Physics Department. It centered physics research around his new instrument, the [[cyclotron]], a type of [[particle accelerator]] for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1939.&lt;ref name="chapter1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Research-Review/Magazine/1981/81fchp1.html |title=Lawrence and His Laboratory: Chapter 1: A New Lab for a New Science |publisher=Lbl.gov |date= |accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1930s, Lawrence pushed to create larger and larger machines for physics research, courting private [[philanthropy|philanthropists]] for funding. He was the first to develop a large team to build big projects to make discoveries in basic research.&lt;ref name="BigScience"&gt;{{cite book |last= Hiltzik |first=Michael |date= 2015 |title=Big Science |url=http://michaelhiltzik.com/big-science |publisher= Simon and Schuster  |isbn= 978-1-4516-7576-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually these machines grew too large to be held on the university grounds, and in 1940 the lab moved to its current site atop the hill above campus.&lt;ref name="chapter1" /&gt;

Part of the team put together during this period includes two other young scientists who went on to establish large laboratories; J. Robert Oppenheimer founded Los Alamos Laboratory, and Robert Wilson founded Fermilab.

[[Leslie Groves]] visited Lawrence's Radiation Laboratory in late 1942 as he was organizing the [[Manhattan Project]], meeting [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] for the first time. Oppenheimer was tasked with organizing the [[nuclear bomb]] development effort and founded today's [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] to help keep the work secret.&lt;ref name="BigScience" /&gt;

At the RadLab, Lawrence and his colleagues developed the technique of  [[Isotope separation#Electromagnetic|electromagnetic enrichment]] of [[uranium]] using their experience with cyclotrons. The [[calutron]]s (named after the University) became the basic unit of the massive [[Y-12 National Security Complex|Y-12]] facility in [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge]], [[Tennessee]].  Lawrence's lab helped contribute to what have been judged to be the three most valuable technology developments of the war (the atomic bomb, proximity fuse, and radar). The cyclotron, whose construction was stalled during the war, was finished in November 1946. The Manhattan Project shut down two months later.

After the war, the Radiation Laboratory became one of the first laboratories to be incorporated into the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) (now Department of Energy, DOE). The most highly classified work remained at Los Alamos, but the RadLab remained involved. [[Edward Teller]] suggested setting up a second lab similar to Los Alamos to compete with their designs. This led to the creation of an offshoot of the RadLab (now the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]) in 1952. Some of the RadLab's work was transferred to the new lab, but some classified research continued at Berkeley Lab until the 1970s, when it became a laboratory dedicated only to unclassified scientific research.

Shortly after the death of Lawrence in August 1958, the UC Radiation Laboratory (both branches) was renamed the '''Lawrence Radiation Laboratory'''. The Berkeley location became the '''Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory''' in 1971,&lt;ref name=apselsl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aps.org/programs/outreach/history/historicsites/lawrencelivingston.cfm |publisher=American Physical Society |title=Ernest Lawrence and M. Stanley Livingston |accessdate=May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="universityofcalifornia.edu"&gt;[http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/labs/ University of California {{pipe}} Office of the President] (accessed July 15, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; although many continued to call it the RadLab. Gradually, another shortened form came into common usage, "'''LBL'''". Its formal name was amended to Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 1995, when "National" was added to the names of all DOE labs. "Ernest Orlando" was later dropped to shorten the name. Today, the lab is commonly referred to as "'''Berkeley Lab'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/early-years.html |title=Ernest Lawrence's Cyclotron |publisher=Lbl.gov |date=August 27, 1958 |accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alvarez Physics Memos are a set of informal [[working paper]]s of the large group of physicists, engineers, computer programmers, and technicians led by [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis W. Alvarez]] from the early 1950s until his death in 1988. Over 1700 memos are available on-line, hosted by the Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alvarezphysicsmemos.lbl.gov|title=Alvarez Physics Memos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science mission==
From the 1950s through the present, Berkeley Lab has maintained its status as a major international center for physics research, and has also diversified its research program into almost every realm of scientific investigation. The Laboratory's 20 scientific divisions are organized within six areas of research: Computing Sciences, Physical Sciences, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Biosciences,  Energy Sciences, and Energy Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbl.gov/research-areas |title=Research Areas at Berkeley Lab |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Berkeley Lab has six main science thrusts: advancing integrated fundamental energy science, integrative biological and environmental system science, advanced computing for science impact, discovering the fundamental properties of matter and energy, accelerators for the future, and developing energy technology innovations for a sustainable future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.energy.gov/~/media/lp/pdf/laboratory-planning-process/SC_Consolidated_Laboratory_Plans.pdf |title= The U.S. Department of Energy's Ten-Year-Plans for the Office of Science National Laboratories |publisher= U.S. Department of Energy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Lawrence's belief that scientific research is best done through teams of individuals with different fields of expertise, working together. His teamwork concept is a Berkeley Lab tradition that continues today.

Berkeley Lab operates five major National User Facilities for the DOE Office of Science: 
# The [[Advanced Light Source]] (ALS) is a synchrotron light source with 41 beam lines providing ultraviolet, soft x-ray, and hard x-ray light to scientific experiments. The ALS is one of the world's brightest sources of soft x-rays, which are used to characterize the electronic structure of matter and to reveal microscopic structures with elemental and chemical specificity. About 2,500 scientist-users carry out research at ALS every year. Berkeley Lab is proposing an upgrade of ALS which would increase the coherent flux of soft x-rays by two-three orders of magnitude. 
#The [[Joint Genome Institute]] (JGI) supports genomic research in support of the DOE missions in alternative energy, glocal carbon cycling, and environmental management.  The JGI's partner laboratories are Berkeley Lab, [[Lawrence Livermore National Lab]] (LLNL), [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL), [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] (PNNL), and the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology.  The JGI's central role is the development of a diversity of large-scale experimental and computational capabilities to link sequence to biological insights relevant to energy and environmental research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jgi.doe.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2016_January_JGI_Strategic_Planning_update.pdf |title = DOE Joint Genome Institute Strategic Planning Update |publisher = Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory | accessdate=May 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 1,200 scientist-users take advantage of JGI's capabilities for their research every year.
# The [[Molecular Foundry]] is a multidisciplinary nanoscience research facility. Its seven research facilities focus on Imaging and Manipulation of Nanostructures, Nanofabrication, Theory of Nanostructured Materials, Inorganic Nanostructures, Biological Nanostructures, Organic and Macromolecular Synthesis, and Electron Microscopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foundry.lbl.gov/facilities/index.html |title=Facilities at the Molecular Foundry |publisher = Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 700 scientist-users make use of these facilities in their research every year.
# The [[National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center]] (NERSC) is the scientific computing facility that provides large-scale computing for the DOE's unclassified research programs. Its current systems provide over 3 billion computational hours annually. NERSC supports 6,000 scientific users from universities, national laboratories, and industry.
# The [[Energy Sciences Network]] (ESnet) is a high-speed network infrastructure optimized for very large scientific data flows.  ESNet provides connectivity for all major DOE sites and facilities, and the network transports roughly 35 petabytes of traffic each month.

Berkeley Lab is the lead partner in the [[Joint BioEnergy Institute]] (JBEI), located in [[Emeryville, California]]. Other partners are the [[Sandia National Laboratories]], the University of California (UC) campuses of Berkeley and Davis, the [[Carnegie Institution for Science]], and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). JBEI's primary scientific mission is to advance the development of the next generation of [[biofuels]] – liquid fuels derived from the solar energy stored in plant biomass. JBEI is one of three new U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Bioenergy Research Centers (BRCs).

Berkeley Lab has a major role in two DOE Energy Innovation Hubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.energy.gov/bes/research/doe-energy-innovation-hubs |title=DOE Energy Innovation Hubs |publisher= Department of Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mission of the [[Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis]] (JCAP) is to find a cost-effective method to produce fuels using only sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. The lead institution for JCAP is the [[California Institute of Technology]] and Berkeley Lab is the second institutional center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://solarfuelshub.org/ |title= Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research (JCESR) is to create next-generation battery technologies that will transform transportation and the electricity grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jcesr.org/about/mission |title= Joint Center for Energy Storage Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Argonne National Laboratory]] leads JCESR and Berkeley Lab is a major partner.

==Operations and governance==
The University of California operates Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under a contract with the Department of Energy. The site consists of 76 buildings (owned by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]]) located on {{convert|200|acre|km2}} owned by the university in the Berkeley Hills. Altogether, the Lab has some 4,000 UC employees, of whom about 800 are students or postdocs, and each year it hosts more than 3,000 participating guest scientists. There are approximately two dozen DOE employees stationed at the laboratory to provide federal oversight of Berkeley Lab's work for the DOE. The laboratory director, Michael Witherell, is appointed by the [[Regents of the University of California|university regents]] and reports to the university president.  Although Berkeley Lab is governed by UC independently of the Berkeley campus, the two entities are closely interconnected: more than 200 Berkeley Lab researchers hold joint appointments as UC Berkeley faculty.

The Lab's budget for fiscal year 2018 was $1.1 billion.

==Scientific achievements, inventions, and discoveries==
Notable scientific accomplishments at the Lab since World War II include the observation of the [[antiproton]], the discovery of several [[transuranic]] [[Chemical element|elements]], and the discovery of the [[accelerating universe]].

Since its inception, 12 researchers associated with Berkeley Lab ([[Ernest Lawrence]], [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], [[Edwin M. McMillan]], [[Owen Chamberlain]], [[Emilio G. Segrè]], [[Donald A. Glaser]], [[Melvin Calvin]], [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis W. Alvarez]], [[Yuan T. Lee]], [[Steven Chu]], [[George F. Smoot]] and [[Saul Perlmutter]])  have been awarded the [[Nobel Prize]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = About the Lab|url = http://www.lbl.gov/about/|website = www.lbl.gov|access-date = January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventy Berkeley Lab scientists are members of the [[U.S. National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS), one of the highest honors for a scientist in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thirteen Berkeley Lab scientists have won the [[National Medal of Science]], the nation's highest award for lifetime achievement in fields of scientific research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Eighteen Berkeley Lab engineers have been elected to the [[National Academy of Engineering]], and three Berkeley Lab scientists have been elected into the [[National Academy of Medicine]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Elements discovered by Berkeley Lab physicists include [[astatine]], [[neptunium]], [[plutonium]], [[curium]], [[americium]], [[berkelium]]*, [[californium]]*, [[einsteinium]], [[fermium]], [[mendelevium]], [[nobelium]], [[lawrencium]]*, [[dubnium]], and [[seaborgium]]*. Those elements listed with asterisks (*) are named after the University Professors Lawrence and Seaborg. Seaborg was the principal scientist involved in their discovery. The element [[technetium]] was discovered after Ernest Lawrence gave Emilio Segrè a [[molybdenum]] strip from the Berkeley Lab cyclotron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/new-elements-here.html |title=Chemical Elements Discovered at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory |publisher=Lbl.gov |date=June 7, 1999 |accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fabricated evidence used to claim the creation of [[oganesson]] and [[livermorium]] by [[Victor Ninov]], a researcher employed at Berkeley Lab, led to the retraction of two articles.&lt;ref name=nature2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dalton|first=Rex|title=The stars who fell to Earth|journal=Nature|year=2002|volume=420|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v420/n6917/pdf/420728a.pdf|accessdate=April 21, 2012|doi=10.1038/420728a|pmid=12490902|pages=728–9|bibcode=2002Natur.420..728D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inventions and discoveries to come out of Berkeley Lab include: "smart" windows with embedded electrodes that enable window glass to respond to changes in sunlight, synthetic genes for antimalaria and anti-AIDS superdrugs based on breakthroughs in [[synthetic biology]], [[electronic ballasts]] for more efficient lighting, [[Home Energy Saver]], the web's first do-it-yourself home energy audit tool, a pocket-sized DNA sampler called the PhyloChip, and the Berkeley Darfur Stove, which uses one-quarter as much firewood as traditional [[cook stoves]]. One of Berkeley Lab's most notable breakthroughs is the discovery of [[dark energy]]. During the 1980s and 1990s Berkeley Lab physicists and astronomers formed the [[Supernova Cosmology Project]] (SCP), using Type Ia supernovae as "standard candles" to measure the expansion rate of the universe. Their successful methods inspired competition, with the result that early in 1998 both the SCP and the [[High-Z Supernova Search Team]] announced the surprising discovery that expansion is accelerating; the cause was soon named dark energy.

[[Arthur Rosenfeld]], a senior scientist at Berkeley Lab, was the nation's leading advocate for energy efficiency from 1975 until his death in 2017. He led efforts at the Lab that produced several  technologies that radically improved efficiency:  compact fluorescent lamps, low-energy refrigerators, and windows that trap heat. He established the Center for Building Science at the Lab, which developed into the Building Technology and Urban Systems Division. He developed the first energy-efficiency standards for buildings and appliances in  California, which helped the state to sustain constant electricity use per capita, a phenomenon called the [[Rosenfeld effect]]. The Energy Efficiency and Environmental Impacts Division continues to set the research foundation for the national energy efficiency standards and works with China, India, and other countries to help develop their standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eaei.lbl.gov/ |title=Energy Efficiency and Environmental Impacts Division |publisher=LBL.gov }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lichenology''' is the branch of [[mycology]] that studies the [[lichen]]s, [[symbiotic]] [[organism]]s made up of an intimate symbiotic association of a microscopic [[alga]] (or a [[cyanobacterium]]) with a [[Hypha|filament]]ous [[fungus]].

Study of lichens draws knowledge from several disciplines: [[mycology]], [[phycology]], [[microbiology]] and [[botany]]. Scholars of lichenology are known as [[lichenologists]].

The [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of lichens was first intensively investigated by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] botanist [[Erik Acharius]] (1757–1819), who is therefore sometimes named the "father of lichenology". Acharius was a student of [[Carl Linnaeus]]. Some of his more important works on the subject, which marked the beginning of lichenology as a discipline, are:

* ''Lichenographiae Suecia prodromus'' (1798)
* ''Methodus lichenum'' (1803)
* ''Lichenographia universalis'' (1810)
* ''Synopsis methodica lichenum'' (1814)
[[File:Flechte auf Fels.jpg|thumb|Lichen on rocks]]
[[File:Lichen foliacé2..JPG|thumb|''[[Evernia prunastri]]'', oakmoss]]

Later lichenologists include the American scientists [[Vernon Ahmadjian]] and [[Edward Tuckerman]] and the [[Russia]]n [[evolutionary biologist]] [[Konstantin Merezhkovsky]], as well as amateurs such as [[Louisa Collings]].

==History==

===The beginnings===

Lichens as a group have received less attention in classical treatises on botany than other groups although the relationship between humans and some species has been documented from early times. Several species have appeared in the works of [[Dioscorides]], [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Theophrastus]] although the studies are not very deep. During the first centuries of the modern age they were usually put forward as examples of [[spontaneous generation]] and their reproductive mechanisms were totally ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Lauder Lindsay, William (1856). ''A Popular History of British Lichens'' p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; For centuries naturalists had included lichens in diverse groups until in the early 18th century a French researcher [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]] in his ''Institutiones Rei Herbariae'' grouped them into their own genus. He adopted the Latin term lichen, which had already been used by Pliny who had imported it from Theophrastus but up until then this term had not been widely employed.&lt;ref&gt;Lauder Lindsay, William (1856). ''A Popular History of British Lichens'' p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The original meaning of the Greek word λειχήν (leichen) was moss that in its turn derives from the Greek verb λείχω (liekho) to suck because of the great ability of these organisms to absorb water. In its original use the term signified [[mosses]], [[liverworts]] as well as [[lichens]]. Some forty years later [[Dillenius]] in his ''Historia Muscorum'' made the first division of the group created by Tournefort separating the sub-families [[Usnea]], [[Coralloides]] and [[Lichens]] in response to the morphological characteristics of the lichen [[thallus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Joseph Pitton de Tournefort |title=Institutiones rei herbariae |language=Latin |trans-title=Institutions of botany |volume=1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2BkOAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Tournefort%22+%22Institutiones+rei+Herbariae%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Tournefort%22%20%22Institutiones%20rei%20Herbariae%22&amp;f=false|year=1700 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the revolution in [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] brought in by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] and his new system of classification lichens are retained in the [[Plant]] Kingdom forming a single group [[Lichen]] with eight divisions within the group according to the morphology of the [[thallus]].&lt;ref&gt;Lauder Lindsay, William (1856). ''A Popular History of British Lichens''. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years research is shedding new light into the nature of these organisms still classified as plants. A controversial issue surrounding lichens since the early 19th century is their reproduction. In these years a group of researchers faithful to the tenets of Linnaeus considered that lichens reproduced sexually and had sexual reproductive organs, as in other plants, independent of whether asexual reproduction also occurred. Other researchers only considered asexual reproduction by means of [[Propagules]].&lt;ref&gt;Lauder Lindsay, William. ''A Popular History of British Lichens''. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===

Against this background appeared the Swedish botanist [[Erik Acharius]] disciple of Linnaeus, who is today considered the father of lichenology, starting the taxonomy of lichens with his pioneering study of Swedish lichens in Lichenographiae Suecicae Prodromus of 1798 or in his Synopsis Methodica Lichenum, Sistens omnes hujus Ordinis Naturalis of 1814.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Acharius |first=Erik |date=1814 |title=Synopsis Methodica Lichenum: Systens omnes hujus ordinis naturalis detectas |language=Latin |trans-title=Synopsis of lichen Methods, systems of this natural order detected |publisher=Svanborg}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies and classifications are the cornerstone of subsequent investigations. In these early years of structuring the new discipline various works of outstanding scientific importance appeared such as Lichenographia Europaea Reformata published in 1831 by [[Elias Fries]] or Enumeratio Critico Lichenum Europaeorum 1850 by [[Ludwig Schaerer]]&lt;ref&gt;http://plants.jstor.org/person/bm000391348?history=true&lt;/ref&gt; in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Lauder Lindsay, William (1856). ''A Popular History of British Lichens''. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Erik Acharius.jpg|thumb|Erik Acharius (1757–1819), Swedish botanist, the father of lichenology]] But these works suffer from being superficial and mere lists of species without further physiological studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schneider | first1 = Albert | year = 1895 | title = The Biological Status of Lichens | url = | journal = Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club | volume = 22 | issue = | page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It took until the middle of the 19th century for research to catch up using biochemical and physiological methods. In Germany [[Ernst Itzigsohn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kiki.huh.harvard.edu/databases/botanist_search.php?id=3942 | title=Harvard University Herbaria &amp; Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Johann Bayrhoffer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kiki.huh.harvard.edu/databases/botanist_search.php?mode=details&amp;botanistid=1617 | title=Harvard University Herbaria &amp; Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; in France [[Edmond Tulasne]] and [[Camille Montagne]], in Russia [[Fedor Buhse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kiki.huh.harvard.edu/databases/botanist_search.php?id=63245 | title=Harvard University Herbaria &amp; Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; in England [[William Allport Leighton]] and in the United States [[Edward Tuckerman]] began to publish works of great scientific importance.

Scientific publications settled many unknown facts about lichens. In the French publication [[Annales des Sciences Naturelles]] in an article of 1852 "Memorie pour servir a l'Histoire des Lichens Organographique et Physiologique" by [[Edmond Tulasne]], the reproductive organs or apothecia of lichens was identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = Thomas A. | year = 1856 | title = The Status of the Algo-Lichen Hypothesis | url = | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 23 | issue = 265 | pages = 1–8 | doi =10.1086/274846 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lauder Lindsay, William (1856). ''A Popular History of British Lichens''. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

These new discoveries were becoming increasingly contradictory for scientists. The [[apothecium]] reproductive organ being unique to [[fungi]] but absent in other [[photosynthetic]] organisms. With improvements in [[microscopy]], [[algae]] were identified in the lichen structure, which heightened the contradictions. At first the presence of algae was taken as being due to contamination due to collection of samples in damp conditions and they were not considered as being in a [[symbiotic]] relation with the fungal part of the thallus. That the algae continued to multiply showed that they were not mere contaminants.

It was [[Anton de Bary]] a German [[mycologist]] who specialised in [[phytopathology]] who first suggested in 1865 that lichens were merely the result of parasitism of various fungi of the [[ascomycetes]] group by [[nostoc]] type algae and others. Successive studies such as those carried out by [[Andrei Famintsyn]] and [[Baranetzky]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kiki.huh.harvard.edu/databases/botanist_search.php?mode=details&amp;id=70084 | title=Harvard University Herbaria &amp; Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1867 showed no dependence of the algal component upon the lichen thallus and that the algal component could live independently of the thallus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fink | first1 = Bruce | year = 1913 | title = The Nature and Classification of Lichens: II. The Lichen and its Algal Host | doi = 10.2307/3753090 | journal = Mycologia | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 97–166 | jstor = 3753090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in 1869 that [[Simon Schwendener]] demonstrated that all lichens were the result of fungal attack on the cells of algal cells and that all these algae also exist free in nature. This researcher was the first to recognise the dual nature of lichens as a result of the capture of the algal component by the fungal component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Honegger | first1 = Rosmarie | year = 2000 | title = Simon Schwendener (1829–1919) and The Dual Hypothesis of Lichens | doi = 10.1639/0007-2745(2000)103[0307:ssatdh]2.0.co;2 | journal = The Bryologist | volume = 103 | issue = 2 | pages = 307–313 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873 [[Jean-Baptiste Edouard Bornet]] concluded form studying many different lichen species that the relationship between fungi and algae was purely [[symbiotic]]. It was also established that algae could associate with many different fungi to form different lichen [[phenotypes]]. [[File:Édouard Bornet.jpg|thumb|French botanist (Jean-Baptiste) Édouard Bornet (1828–1911)]]

===20th century===

In 1909 the Russian lichenologist [[Konstantin Mereschkowski]] presented a research paper "The Theory of two Plasms as the basis of [[Symbiogenesis]], A new study on the Origin of Organisms", which aims to explain a new theory of Symbiogenesis by lichens and other organisms as evidenced by his earlier work "Nature and Origin of [[Chromatophores]] in the Plant Kingdom". These new ideas can be studied today under the title of the Theory of [[Endosymbiosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cavalier-Smith | first1 = T | year = 2003 | title = Microbial Muddles | doi = 10.1641/0006-3568(2003)053[1008:mm]2.0.co;2 | journal = BioScience | volume = 53 | issue = 10 | pages = 1008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the above studies the dual nature of lichens remained no more than a theory until in 1939 the Swiss researcher Eugen A Thomas&lt;ref&gt;[[Species:Eugen A. Thomas]]&lt;/ref&gt; was able to reproduce in the laboratory the phenotype of the lichen ''[[Cladonia pyxidata]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.voyageurcountry.com/htmls/floweringplants/plants/pixiecups.html | title=Pixie Cups (Cladonia pyxidata)}}&lt;/ref&gt; by combining its two identified components.

During the 20th century botany and mycology were still attempting to solve the two main problems surrounding lichens. On the one hand the definition of lichens and the relationship between the two symbionts and the taxonomic position of these organisms within the plant and fungal kingdoms. There appeared numerous renowned researchers within the field of lichenology [[Henry Nicollon des Abbayes]], [[William Alfred Weber]], [[Antonina Georgievna Borissova]], [[Irwin M. Brodo]], [[George Albert Llano]].

Lichenology has found applications beyond [[biology]] itself in the field of [[geology]] in a technique known as [[lichenometry]] where the age of an exposed surface can be found by studying the age of lichens growing on them. Age dating in this way can be absolute or relative because the growth of these organisms can be arrested under various conditions. The technique provides an average age of the older individual lichens providing a minimum age of the medium being studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Procesos biofísicos actuales en medios fríos: estudios recientes |language=Spanish |trans-title=Current biophysical processes in cold environments: recent studies |editor=Antonio Gómez Ortiz |date=1998 |publisher=Edicions Universitat Barcelona |url=https://books.google.com/?id=r_LQ70GnOnoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA327&amp;dq=lichenometry#v=onepage&amp;q=lichenometry&amp;f=false|isbn=9788447519231 }} Miguel Mateo Garcia, The Growth Curve of Rhizocarpon geographicum in the Valley of Madriu Andorra, Biophysical Processes in Cold Media {{ISBN|84-475-1923-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichenometry relies upon the fact that the maximum diameter of the largest thallus of an [[epilithic]] lichen growing on a substrate is directly proportional to the time from first exposure of the area to the environment as seen in studies by [[Roland Beschel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geomorphology.org.uk/assets/publications/subsections/pdfs/OnsitePublicationSubsection/91/4.2.7_lichenometry.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203072554/http://www.geomorphology.org.uk/assets/publications/subsections/pdfs/OnsitePublicationSubsection/91/4.2.7_lichenometry.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1950 and is especially useful in areas exposed for less than 1000 years. Growth is greatest in the first 20 to 100 years with 15–50&amp;nbsp;mm growth per year and less in the following years with average growth of 2–4&amp;nbsp;mm per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xASdKCoT6McC&amp;pg=PA562&amp;dq=lichenometry#v=onepage&amp;q=lichenometry&amp;f=false |last=Schaetzl Randall |first=J; |author2=Sharon Anderson |year=2005 |title=Soils Genesis &amp; Geomorphology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=562 |isbn=978-0521812016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty of giving a definition applicable to every known lichen has been debated since lichenologists first recognised the dual nature of lichens. In 1982 the [[International Association for Lichenology]] convened a meeting to adopt a single definition of lichen drawing on the proposals of a committee. The chairman of this committee was the renowned researcher [[Vernon Ahmadjian]]. The definition finally adopted was that lichen could be considered as the association between a fungus and a photosynthetic symbiont resulting in a thallus of specific structure.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 1989"&gt;David L. Hawksworth (1989) "Interactions Fungus and Alga in Lichen Symbiosis liquenoides" ''Annals of the Botanical Garden of Madrid'' (46).&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a simple [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] definition soon brought criticism from various lichenologists and there soon emerged reviews and suggestions for amendments. For example, [[David L. Hawksworth]] considered the definition imperfect because it is impossible to determine which one thallus is of a specific structure since thalli changed depending upon the substrate and conditions in which they developed. This researcher represents one of the main trends among lichenologists who consider it impossible to give a single definition to lichens since they are a unique type of organism.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 1989"/&gt;

Today studies in lichenology are not restricted to the description and taxonomy of lichens but have application in various scientific fields. Especially important are studies on [[environmental quality]] that are made through the interaction of lichens with their environment. Lichen is extremely sensitive to various air pollutants, especially to [[sulphur dioxide]], which causes [[acid rain]] and prevents water absorption. [[File:Merezhkovsky K S.jpg|thumb|K S Merezhkovsky Russian Lichenologist (1855–1921)]]

==Lichens in pharmacology==
Although several species of lichen have been used in [[traditional medicine]] it was not until the early 20th century that modern science became interested in them. The discovery of various substances with [[antibacterial]] action in lichen thalli was essential for scientists to become aware of the possible importance of these organisms to [[medicine]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://lichens.science.oregonstate.edu/antibiotics/lichen_antibiotics.htm] Mike Crockett, Stacie Kageyama, Delfina Homen, Carrie Lewis, Jane Osborn, Logan Sander (2003). "Antibacterial Properties of four Pacific North West Lichens".&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1940s there appeared various works by the noted [[microbiologist]] [[Rufus Paul Burkholder]] who demonstrated antibacterial action of lichens of the genus ''[[Usnea]]'' against ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' and ''[[Sarcina lutea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://modmedmicrobes.wikispaces.com/Sarcina+Lutea | title=Wikispaces}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies showed that the substance that inhibited growth of bacteria was [[usnic acid]]. Something similar occurred with the substance [[Ramelina]] synthesised by the lichen ''[[Ramalina reticulata]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/106/2756/394.extract | doi=10.1126/science.106.2756.394| pmid=17750561| title=Antibiotic Compound Isolated from the Lichen Ramalina reticulata| journal=Science| volume=106| issue=2756| pages=394–395| year=1947| last1=Marshak| first1=A.| last2=Barry| first2=G. T.| last3=Craig| first3=L. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless, these substances proved ineffective against [[Gram negative bacteria]] such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas]]''. With these investigations the number of antibacterial substances and possible drug targets known to be produced by lichens increased [[ergosterol]], [[usnic acid]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;Bustinza, Francisco (1948) "Contribution to the Study of Antibiotics Produced by Lichens". ''Annals of the Botanical Garden of Madrid'' (7) ISSN pp. 511–548.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in the potential of substances synthesised by lichens increased with the end of [[World War II]] along with the growing interest in all [[antibiotic]] substances. In 1947 antibacterial action was identified in extracts of ''[[Cetraria islandica]]'' and the compounds identified as responsible for bacterial inhibition were shown to be [[d-protolichosteric acid]] and [[d-1-usnic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;Bustinza, Francisco (1951) "Contribution to the Study of Antibacterial Activity in ''Cetraria islandica''". ''Annals of the Botanical Garden of Madrid'' (10) ISSN pp. 144–149.&lt;/ref&gt; Further investigations have identified novel antibacterial substances, [[Alectosarmentin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Antibacterial action of substances produced by lichens is related to their ability to disrupt bacterial [[proteins]] with a subsequent loss of bacterial [[metabolic]] capacity. This is possible due to the action of lichen [[Natural phenol|phenol]]ics such as [[usnic acid]] derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;Neli Kika Honda &amp; Wagner Vilegas (1998) "The Chemistry of Lichens" (Port)[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0100-40421999000100018&amp;lng=in&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=in] Quimica Nova 22(1) ISSN 0100-4042&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s the lichen product [[usnic acid]] was the object of most [[antitumour]] research. These studies revealed some [[in vitro]] antitumour activity by substances identified in two common lichens ''[[Peltigera leucophlebia]]'' and ''[[Collema flaccidum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch/search.ebi?db=allebi&amp;t=%22Collema+flaccidum%22 | title=EBI Search}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Nanotough logo.JPG|thumb|alt=The logo of the project.|Nanotough.]]
'''Nanotough''' is a European framework project that focuses on developing tough plastic materials using nanotechnology. A total of 11 partners from [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Romania]] and [[Denmark]] are participating in the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanotough.aau.dk/ Nanotough.aau.dk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nanotough objectives==
The objective of Nanotough is to obtain a deeper understanding of the interfacial structure of nanocomposites within a [[polyolefin]] matrix and thus use [[nanoparticles]] like nanoclay to turn upside down the construction of a number of well-known products, where today metals or plastics are used in for example cars or aircraft. The project will enable realization of the great performance potential of these materials through development of novel multiphase and hybrid nanocomposites.

The project aims to improve the stiffness of polyolefin nanocomposites while not only maintaining but also improving the toughness of the matrix considerably. The technical objective is to optimize and, through novel [[interface design]], to develop new cost effective hybrid (nanofiller-fibre) nanocomposites as an alternative to heavily filled [[polymers]] and expensive engineering polymers and fulfill industry requirements for high performance materials in high tech applications.
Nanocomposites are emerging new materials that promise improved properties, but in practice, it has been difficult to translate existing knowledge on nanotechnology into tangible products. Nanotough’s objective is, in addition to basic research, to remove the technical barriers so that nano-composite-materials can be used commercially and lead to development of new products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanotough.aau.dk/about_nanotough/ About Nanotough at Nanotough.aau.dk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321182036/http://www.nanotough.aau.dk/about_nanotough/ |date=2012-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of noise-based logic and its name was created by [[Laszlo B. Kish]]. In its foundation paper&lt;ref name =first/&gt;  it is noted that the idea was inspired by the stochasticity of [[brain]] signals and by the unconventional noise-based communication schemes, such as the [[Laszlo_B._Kish|Kish]] cypher.

==The noise-based logic space and hyperspace==
The logic values are represented by [[multi-dimensional]] "[[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]]s" ([[orthogonal functions]]) and their [[Superposition principle|superposition]], where the [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis vectors]] are independent noises. By the proper combination (products or [[Intersection (set theory)|set-theoretical products]]) of basis-noises, which are called ''noise-bit'', a logic hyperspace can be constructed with  {{nowrap|''D''(''N'') {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} number of [[dimension]]s, where ''N'' is the number of noise-bits. Thus ''N'' noise-bits in a single wire correspond to a system of {{nowrap| 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} classical bits that can express {{nowrap| 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}} different logic values. Independent realizations of a stochastic process of zero mean have zero [[cross-correlation]] with each other and with other stochastic processes of zero mean. Thus the basis noise vectors are orthogonal not only to each other but they and all the noise-based logic states (superpositions) are orthogonal also to any background noises in the hardware. Therefore, the noise-based logic concept is robust against background noises, which is a property that can potentially offer a high energy-efficiency.

==The types of signals used in noise-based logic==
In the paper,&lt;ref name =first/&gt; where noise-based logic was first introduced, generic stochastic-processes with zero mean were proposed and a system of orthogonal sinusoidal signals were also proposed as a deterministic-signal version of the logic system. The mathematical analysis about statistical errors and signal energy was limited to the cases of [[Gaussian process|Gaussian noises]] and superpositions as logic signals in the basic logic space and their products and superpositions of their products in the logic hyperspace (see also.&lt;ref name =second/&gt; In the subsequent brain logic scheme,&lt;ref name =third/&gt; the logic signals were (similarly to neural signals) unipolar spike sequences generated by a [[Poisson process]], and set-theoretical unifications (superpositions) and intersections (products) of different spike sequences. Later, in the instantaneous noise-based logic schemes&lt;ref name =fourth/&gt;&lt;ref name =fifth/&gt;  and computation works,&lt;ref name =sixth/&gt; random telegraph waves (periodic time, bipolar, with fixed absolute value of amplitude) were also utilized as one of the simplest stochastic processes available for NBL. With choosing unit amplitude and symmetric probabilities, the resulting random-telegraph wave has 0.5 probability to be in the +1 or in the -1 state which is held over the whole clock period.

==The noise-based logic gates==
Noise-based logic [[Logic gate|gates]] can be classified according to the method the input identifies the logic value at the input. The first gates&lt;ref name =first/&gt;&lt;ref name =second/&gt; analyzed the statistical correlations between the input signal and the reference noises. The advantage of these is the robustness against background noise. The disadvantage is the slow speed and higher hardware complexity. The instantaneous logic gates&lt;ref name =third/&gt;&lt;ref name =fourth/&gt;&lt;ref name =fifth/&gt; are fast, they have low complexity but they are not robust against background noises. With either neural spike type signals or with [[Bipolar signal|bipolar]] random-telegraph waves of unity absolute amplitude, and randomness only in the sign of the amplitude offer very simple instantaneous logic gates. Then linear or analog devices unnecessary and the scheme can operate in the digital domain. However, whenever instantaneous logic must be interfaced with classical logic schemes, the interface must use [[Correlation function|correlator]]-based logic gates for an error-free signal.&lt;ref name =fourth/&gt;

==Universality of noise-based logic==
All the noise-based logic schemes listed above have been proven universal.&lt;ref name =first/&gt;&lt;ref name =fourth/&gt;&lt;ref name =fifth/&gt; The papers typically produce the [[Inverter (logic gate)|NOT]] and the [[AND gate|AND]] gates to prove universality, because having both of them is a satisfactory condition for the universality of a [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean logic]].

==Computation by noise-based logic==
The string verification work&lt;ref name =sixth/&gt; over a slow communication channel shows a powerful computing application where the methods is inherently based on calculating the [[hash function]]. The scheme is based on random telegraph waves and it is mentioned in the paper&lt;ref name =sixth/&gt; that the authors intuitively conclude that the ''[[intelligence]]'' of the brain is using similar operations to make a reasonably good decision based on a limited amount of information. The superposition of the first {{nowrap|''D''(''N'') {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} integer numbers can be produced with only 2''N'' operations, which the authors call "Achilles ankle operation" in the paper.&lt;ref name =second/&gt;

==Computer chip realization of noise-based logic==
Preliminary schemes have already been published&lt;ref name="sixth"/&gt; to utilize noise-based logic in practical computers. However, it is obvious from these papers that this young field has yet a long way to go before it will be seen in everyday applications.

An '''object language''' is a [[language]] which is the "object" of study in various fields including [[logic]], [[linguistics]], [[mathematics]], and [[theoretical computer science]].  The language being used to talk about an object language is called a [[metalanguage]].  An object language may be a [[formal language|formal]] or [[natural language|natural]] language.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

== Forms of object language ==
=== Formal languages ===

[[Mathematical logic]] and [[linguistics]] make use of metalanguages, which are languages for describing the nature of other languages. In mathematical logic, the object language is usually a [[formal language]]. The language which a metalanguage is used to describe is the object language. It is called that because that language is the object under discussion using the metalanguage.

For instance, someone who says "In French, you say ''Bonjour'' to greet someone" uses [[English language|English]] as a metalanguage to describe the object language [[French language|French]].

=== Computer languages ===

There are two ways the term ''object language'' can be used in computing: a language which is the object of formal specification, and a language which is the object (goal) of a compiler or interpreter.

==== Formal specification ====

{{Main|Specification language}}

Computer languages are object languages of the metalanguage in which their [[specification]] is written. In computer science this is referred to as the [[specification language]]. [[Backus–Naur form]] was one of the earliest used specification languages.

When [[compiler]]s are written using systems like [[lex (software)|lex]] and [[yacc]], the rules the programmer writes look much like a formal specification, but it is considered an [[implementation]] instead. Many [[programming language implementation]]s are not strictly the same as their specifications, adding features or making implementation-dependent design decisions.

==== Object Code ====

{{Main|Object file}}

At their basic level, computers act on what is given to them through a limited set of instructions which are understood by their [[CPU]]s. In the earliest computers, that meant programmers sometimes composed actual 1's and 0's to program. Since this requires considerable programmer training (and patience) to create instructions, later computer languages have gone to great lengths to simplify the programmer's task. For example, a high level programming language may allow a programmer to assign a value to a variable without specifying a memory location or a CPU instruction.

In this context, the high level programming language is the ''source language'', which is then translated by a [[compiler]] into [[object code]] that the CPU can read directly. This object code is the ''object language'', and varies depending on what CPU is being given the instructions.

''Object language'' in this context means something akin to "the object of what the programmer is trying to achieve". If the source language and object languages are viewed as formal (logical) languages, what the compiler does is ''interpret'' the source into the target language (this is different from the computer science use of ''[[interpreted language]]'' meaning one which is ''not'' compiled).

''Object language'' in this context is synonymous with ''target language''.  The object language of a translation most often is a [[machine language]], but can be some other kind of language, such as [[assembly language]].

Because the object language of compilation has usually been machine language, the term ''[[object file]]'' has come to mean a file containing machine instructions, and sometimes the translated program itself is simply called an ''object''.

''Object language'' should also not be confused with ''[[object-oriented language]]'', which is a type of computer [[programming language]] which changes the programmer's environment into convenient objects which can be used in something similar to a drag-and-drop fashion.

== Expressions in an object language ==
=== Symbols ===
{{Main|Symbol (formal)}}

A ''symbol'' is an [[idea]], [[abstraction]] or [[concept]], [[type-token distinction|token]]s of which may be marks or a configuration of marks which form a particular pattern. Although the term "symbol" in common use refers at some times to the idea being symbolized, and at other times to the marks on a piece of paper or chalkboard which are being used to express that idea; in the [[formal language]]s studied in [[mathematics]] and [[logic]], the term "symbol" refers to the idea, and the marks are considered to be a [[type-token distinction|token]] instance of the symbol.

=== Formulas ===
{{Main|Well-formed formula}}

In the formal languages used in mathematical logic and computer science, a ''well-formed formula'' or simply ''formula'' is an [[idea]], [[abstraction]] or [[concept]] which is expressed using the [[symbol (formal)|symbol]]s and [[formation rule]]s (also called the [[formal grammar]]) of a particular formal language. To say that a [[string (computer science)|string]] of symbols &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a well-formed formula with respect to a given formal grammar &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to saying that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the language generated by &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Formal systems ===
{{Main|Formal system}}

A ''formal system'' is a [[formal language]] together with a [[deductive system]] which consists of a set of [[inference rule]]s and/or [[axiom]]s. A formal system is used to [[formal proof|derive]] one expression from one or more other expressions previously expressed in the system. These expressions are called [[axiom]]s, in the case of those previously supposed to be true, or [[theorem]]s, in the case of those derived. A formal system may be formulated and studied for its intrinsic properties, or it may be intended as a description (i.e. a [[Interpretation (logic)|model]]) of external phenomena.

=== Theorems ===
{{Main|Theorem}}

A ''theorem'' is a [[symbol (formal)|symbol]] or string of symbols which is [[formal proof|derived]] by using a [[formal system]]. The string of symbols is a [[logical consequence]] of the [[axiom]]s and [[rule of inference|rules]] of the system.

=== Formal proofs ===
{{Main|Formal proof}}

A ''formal proof'' or ''derivation'' is a finite sequence of [[proposition]]s (called [[well-formed formula]]s in the case of a [[formal language]]) each of which is an [[axiom]] or follows from the preceding sentences in the sequence by a [[rule of inference]]. The last sentence in the sequence is a [[theorem]] of a [[formal system]]. The concept of [[natural deduction]] is a [[generalization]] of the concept of proof.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]], ''deduction''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orientalism''' is a term used by art historians and literary and [[cultural studies]] scholars for the imitation or depiction of aspects in [[Eastern world|West Asian, South Asian, Southeast Asian and East Asian cultures]]. These depictions are usually done by writers, designers, and artists from the West. In particular, '''Orientalist painting''', depicting more specifically "the [[Middle East]]",&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 6&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the many specialisms of 19th-century [[academic art]], and the literature of Western countries took a similar interest in Oriental themes.

Since the publication of [[Edward Said]]'s ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' in 1978, much academic discourse has begun to use the term "Orientalism" to refer to a general patronizing Western attitude towards Middle Eastern, Asian, and North African societies. In Said's analysis, the West [[Essentialism|essentializes]] these societies as static and undeveloped—thereby fabricating a view of Oriental culture that can be studied, depicted, and reproduced. Implicit in this fabrication, writes Said, is the idea that Western society is developed, rational, flexible, and superior.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood Mamdani, ''Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terrorism'', New York: Pantheon, 2004; {{ISBN|0-375-42285-4}}; p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
Orientalism refers to the [[Orient]], in reference and opposition to the [[Occident]]; the East and the West, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Latin ''Oriens'', ''Oxford English Dictionary''. p. 000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward. "Orientalism," New York: Vintage Books, 1979. p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; The word Orient entered the English language as the [[Middle French]] ''orient''. The root word ''oriēns'', from the Latin ''Oriēns'', has synonymous denotations: The eastern part of the world; the sky whence comes the sun; the east; the rising sun, etc.; yet the denotation changed as a term of geography. In the "[[Monk's Tale]]" (1375), [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] wrote: "That they conquered many regnes grete / In the orient, with many a fair citee." The term "orient" refers to countries east of the Mediterranean Sea and Southern Europe. ''In Place of Fear'' (1952), [[Aneurin Bevan]] used an expanded denotation of the Orient that comprehended [[East Asia]]: "the awakening of the Orient under the impact of Western ideas". Edward Said said that Orientalism "enables the political, economic, cultural and social domination of the West, not just during colonial times, but also in the present."&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward. "Orientalism," New York: Vintage Books, 1979: 357&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
In art history, the term Orientalism refers to the works of the Western artists who specialized in Oriental subjects, produced from their travels in [[Western Asia]], during the 19th century. In that time, artists and scholars were described as Orientalists, especially in France, where the dismissive use of the term "Orientalist" was made popular by the art critic [[Jules-Antoine Castagnary]].&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 20&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such social disdain for a style of [[Representation (arts)|representational art]], the [[Société des Peintres Orientalistes Français|French Society of Orientalist Painters]] was founded in 1893, with [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] as the honorary president;&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 74&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Britain, the term Orientalist identified "an artist".&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the French Orientalist Painters Society changed the consciousness of practitioners towards the end of the 19th century, since artists could now see themselves as part of a distinct art movement.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, R., ''Orientalist Aesthetics: Art, Colonialism, and French North Africa, 1880-1930,'' 2003, pp 57 -78&lt;/ref&gt; As an art movement, Orientalist painting is generally treated as one of the many branches of 19th-century [[academic art]]; however, many different styles of Orientalist art were in evidence. Art historians tend to identify two broad types of Orientalist artist: the realists who carefully painted what they observed and those who imagined Orientalist scenes without ever leaving the studio.&lt;ref&gt;Mercedes Volait, "Middle Eastern collections of Orientalist Painting at the Turn of the 21st century: Paradoxical reversal or persistent misunderstanding?; François Pouillon and Jean-Claude Vatin, ''After Orientalism: Critical perspectives on Western Agency and Eastern Reappropriations," ''Leiden Studies in Islam and Society,'' pp 251-271, 2014, Online: &lt;http://www.brill.com/products/book/after-orientalism&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; French painters such as [[Eugène Delacroix]] (1798–1863) and [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1824–1904) are widely regarded as the leading luminaries of the Orientalist movement.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia.com, https://www.encyclopedia.com/literature-and-arts/art-and-architecture/art-general/orientalism&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oriental studies===
In the 18th and 19th centuries, the term [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] identified a scholar who specialized in the languages and literatures of the [[Eastern world]]. Among such scholars were British officials of the [[East India Company]], who said that the [[Arab culture]], the [[culture of India]], and the [[Islamic culture]]s should be studied as equal to the cultures of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Macfie |first = A. L.|year = 2002 |title = Orientalism |publisher = Longman| location = London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0FrJAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn = 0582423864|ref = none| p = Ch One}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among such scholars is the philologist [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]], whose studies of [[Indo-European languages]] established modern [[philology]]. British [[Company rule in India|imperial strategy in India]] favored Orientalism as a technique for developing good relations with the natives—until the 1820s, when the influence of "anglicists" such as [[Thomas Babington Macaulay]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] led to the promotion of Anglocentric education.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway (2006), pp. 1–2. "The Orientalism espoused by Warren Hastings, William Jones and the early East India Company sought to maintain British domination over the Indian subcontinent through patronage of Hindu and Muslim languages and institutions, rather than through their eclipse by English speech and aggressive European acculturation."&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[Hebraists|Hebraism]] and [[Jewish studies]] gained popularity among British and German scholars in the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0008_0_08624.html|title=Hebraists, Christian|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic field of [[Oriental studies]], which comprehended the cultures of the [[Near East]] and the [[Far East]], became the fields of [[Asian studies]] and [[Middle Eastern studies]].

===Critical studies===
In the book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978), the cultural critic Edward Said redefined the term Orientalism to describe a pervasive Western tradition — academic and artistic — of prejudiced outsider-interpretations of the Eastern world, which was shaped by the cultural attitudes of European [[imperialism]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 24&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis of ''Orientalism'' develops [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s theory of [[cultural hegemony]], and [[Michel Foucault]]'s theorisation of [[discourse]] (the [[knowledge]]-and-[[Power (social and political)|power]] relation) to criticise the scholarly tradition of Oriental studies. Said criticised contemporary scholars who perpetuated the tradition of outsider-interpretation of [[Arab]]o-Islamic cultures, especially [[Bernard Lewis]] and [[Fouad Ajami]].&lt;ref&gt;''Orientalism'' (1978) Preface, 2003 ed. p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xypolia|first=Ilia|title=Orientations and Orientalism: The Governor Sir Ronald Storrs|journal=Journal of IslamicJerusalem Studies|year=2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=24–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analyses are of Orientalism in European literature, especially French literature, and do not analyse [[visual art]] and [[Orientalist painting]]. In that vein, the art historian [[Linda Nochlin]] applied Said's methods of critical analysis to art, "with uneven results".&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 6, 11 (quoted), 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[academy]], the book ''Orientalism'' (1978) became a foundational text of [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial cultural studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xypolia|first=Ilia|title=Orientations and Orientalism: The Governor Sir Ronald Storrs|journal=Journal of Islamic Jerusalem Studies|year=2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=25–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in relation to the cultural institution of [[citizenship]], Orientalism has rendered the concept of ''citizenship'' as a problem of [[epistemology]], because citizenship originated as a social institution of the Western world; as such, the problem of defining citizenship reconfigures the idea of ''Europe'' in time of crises.&lt;ref&gt;Mura, Andrea, (2015) "[https://www.academia.edu/21512966/Dis-orienting_Austerity_The_Indebted_Citizen_as_the_New_Soul_of_Europe Disorienting Austerity: The Indebted Citizen as the New Soul of Europe]" In Engin Isin (ed.), ''Citizenship After Orientalism: Transforming Political Theory''. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Said said that Orientalism, as an "idea of representation is a theoretical one: The Orient is a stage on which the whole East is confined" in order to make the Eastern world "less fearsome to the West";&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Said, Edward. "Orientalism," New York: Vintage Books, 1979: 363&lt;/ref&gt; that the developing world, primarily the West, is the cause of [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Said|first1=Edward|title=Orientalism|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JncXpQQoZAo|date=April 16, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in ''Empire: A Very Short Introduction'' (2000), Stephen Howe agreed with Said that Western nations and their empires were created by the exploitation of underdeveloped countries, by the extraction of wealth and labour from one country to another country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howe|first1=Stephen|title=Empire:A Very Short Introduction|publisher=Oxford University press|pages=73–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In European architecture and design==
{{Further|Orientalism in early modern France}}
The [[Moresque]] style of [[Renaissance]] [[ornament (art)|ornament]] is a European adaptation of the Islamic [[arabesque]] that began in the late 15th century and was to be used in some types of work, such as [[bookbinding]], until almost the present day. Early architectural use of motifs lifted from the Indian subcontinent is known as [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture]]. One of the earliest examples is the façade of [[Guildhall, London]] (1788–1789). The style gained momentum in the west with the publication of views of India by [[William Hodges]], and [[William Daniell|William]] and [[Thomas Daniell]] from about 1795. Examples of "Hindoo" architecture are [[Sezincote House]] (c. 1805) in [[Gloucestershire]], built for a [[nabob]] returned from [[Bengal]], and the [[Royal Pavilion]] in [[Brighton]].

''[[Turquerie]]'', which began as early as the late 15th century, continued until at least the 18th century, and included both the use of "Turkish" styles in the decorative arts, the adoption of Turkish costume at times, and interest in art depicting the [[Ottoman Empire]] itself. Venice, the traditional trading partner of the Ottomans, was the earliest centre, with France becoming more prominent in the 18th century.

''[[Chinoiserie]]'' is the catch-all term for the fashion for Chinese themes in decoration in Western Europe, beginning in the late 17th century and peaking in waves, especially [[Rococo]] Chinoiserie, ''c.'' 1740–1770. From the [[Renaissance]] to the 18th century, Western designers attempted to imitate the technical sophistication of Chinese ceramics with only partial success. Early hints of Chinoiserie appeared in the 17th century in nations with active East India companies: England (the [[East India Company]]), Denmark (the [[Danish East India Company]]), the Netherlands (the [[Dutch East India Company]]) and France (the [[French East India Company]]). Tin-glazed pottery made at [[Delft]] and other Dutch towns adopted genuine [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]-era [[blue and white porcelain]] from the early 17th century. Early ceramic wares made at [[Meissen]] and other centers of true [[porcelain]] imitated Chinese shapes for dishes, vases and [[teaware]]s (see [[Chinese export porcelain]]).

Pleasure pavilions in "Chinese taste" appeared in the formal parterres of late Baroque and Rococo German palaces, and in tile panels at [[Aranjuez]] near [[Madrid]]. [[Thomas Chippendale]]'s mahogany tea tables and china cabinets, especially, were embellished with fretwork glazing and railings, ''c.'' 1753–70. Sober ''homages'' to early Xing scholars' furnishings were also naturalized, as the ''tang'' evolved into a mid-Georgian side table and squared slat-back armchairs that suited English gentlemen as well as Chinese scholars. Not every adaptation of Chinese design principles falls within mainstream "chinoiserie". Chinoiserie media included imitations of lacquer and painted tin (tôle) ware that imitated japanning, early painted wallpapers in sheets, and ceramic figurines and table ornaments. Small [[pagoda]]s appeared on chimneypieces and full-sized ones in gardens. [[Kew]] has a magnificent garden pagoda designed by [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]]. The [[Wilhelma]] (1846) in [[Stuttgart]] is an example of [[Moorish Revival architecture]]. [[Leighton House Museum|Leighton House]], built for the artist [[Frederic Leighton]], has a conventional facade but elaborate Arab-style interiors, including original Islamic tiles and other elements as well as Victorian Orientalizing work.

After 1860, ''[[Japonism]],'' sparked by the importing of [[ukiyo-e]], became an important influence in the western arts. In particular, many modern French artists such as [[Claude Monet]] and [[Edgar Degas]] were influenced by the Japanese style. [[Mary Cassatt]], an American artist who worked in France, used elements of combined patterns, flat planes and shifting perspective of Japanese prints in her own images.&lt;ref&gt;The subject of Ives&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings of [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]'s ''[[The Peacock Room]]'' demonstrated how he used aspects of Japanese tradition and are some of the finest works of the genre. California architects [[Greene and Greene]] were inspired by Japanese elements in their design of the [[Gamble House (Pasadena, California)|Gamble House]] and other buildings.

[[Egyptian Revival architecture]] became popular in the early and mid-19th century and continued as a minor style into the early 20th century. [[Moorish Revival architecture]] began in the early 19th century in the German states and was particularly popular for building synagogues. [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture]] was a genre that arose in the late 19th century in the [[British Raj]].

==Orientalist art==
===Pre-19th century===
[[File:Gentile Bellini Madonna and Child Enthroned late 15th century.jpg|thumb|A "Bellini type" [[Islamic]] [[prayer rug]], seen from the top, at the feet of the [[Virgin Mary]], in [[Gentile Bellini]]'s ''Madonna and Child Enthroned'', late 15th century]]
Depictions of Islamic "[[Moors]]" and "Turks" (imprecisely named [[Muslim]] groups of [[southern Europe]], [[North Africa]] and [[West Asia]]) can be found in Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque art. In Biblical scenes in [[Early Netherlandish painting]], secondary figures, especially Romans, were given exotic costumes that distantly reflected the clothes of the [[Near East]]. The [[Biblical Magi|Three Magi]] in [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity scenes]] were an especial focus for this. In general art with Biblical settings would not be considered as Orientalist except where contemporary or historicist Middle Eastern detail or settings is a feature of works, as with some paintings by [[Gentile Bellini]] and others, and a number of 19th century works. Renaissance [[Venice]] had a phase of particular interest in depictions of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in painting and [[old master print|prints]]. Gentile Bellini, who travelled to [[Constantinople]] and painted the Sultan, and [[Vittore Carpaccio]] were the leading painters. By then the depictions were more accurate, with men typically dressed all in white. The depiction of [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting]] sometimes draws from Orientalist interest, but more often just reflects the prestige these expensive objects had in the period.&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Étienne Liotard]] (1702–1789) visited [[Istanbul]] and painted numerous [[pastel]]s of Turkish domestic scenes; he also continued to wear Turkish attire for much of the time when he was back in Europe. The ambitious Scottish 18th-century artist [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] found a solution to the problem of using modern dress, considered unheroic and inelegant, in [[history painting]] by using Middle Eastern settings with Europeans wearing local costume, as travelers were advised to do. His huge ''James Dawkins and Robert Wood Discovering the Ruins of [[Palmyra]]'' (1758, now Edinburgh) elevates tourism to the heroic, with the two travelers wearing what look very like [[toga]]s. Many travelers had themselves painted in exotic Eastern dress on their return, including [[Lord Byron]], as did many who had never left Europe, including [[Madame de Pompadour]].&lt;ref&gt;Christine Riding, ''Travellers and Sitters: The Orientalist Portrait'', in Tromans, 48–75&lt;/ref&gt; The growing French interest in exotic Oriental luxury and lack of liberty in the 18th century to some extent reflected a pointed analogy with France's own [[absolute monarchy]].&lt;ref name="McCabe2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ina Baghdiantz McCabe|title=Orientalism in Early Modern France: Eurasian Trade, Exoticism and the Ancien Regime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XnS6lVLapI4C&amp;pg=PA134|accessdate=31 August 2013|date=15 July 2008|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84520-374-0|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byron's poetry was highly influential in introducing Europe to the heady cocktail of [[Romanticism]] in exotic Oriental settings which was to dominate 19th century Oriental art.

===French Orientalism===
[[File:Leon Cogniet - L Expedition D Egypte Sous Les Ordres De Bonaparte.jpg|thumb|240px|''The 1798 Egyptian Expedition Under the Command of Bonaparte'', [[Léon Cogniet]], 1835. [[Musée du Louvre]]]]
[[File:Ferdinand-Victor-Eugène Delacroix, French - The Death of Sardanapalus - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|240px|''[[The Death of Sardanapalus]]'', [[Eugène Delacroix]], 1827]]
French Orientalist painting was transformed by [[Napoleon]]'s ultimately unsuccessful [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invasion of Egypt and Syria]] in 1798–1801, which stimulated great public interest in [[Egyptology]], and was also recorded in subsequent years by Napoleon's court painters, especially [[Antoine-Jean Gros]], although the Middle Eastern campaign was not one on which he accompanied the army. Two of his most successful paintings, ''[[Bonaparte Visiting the Plague Victims of Jaffa]]'' (1804) and ''[[Battle of Abukir (1799)|Battle of Abukir]]'' (1806) focus on the Emperor, as he was by then, but include many Egyptian figures, as does the less effective ''Napoleon at the Battle of the Pyramids'' (1810). [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]]'s ''La Révolte du Caire'' (1810) was another large and prominent example. A well-illustrated ''Description de l'Égypte'' was published by the French Government in twenty volumes between 1809 and 1828, concentrating on [[antiquities]].&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 69–70&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugène Delacroix]]'s first great success, ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' (1824) was painted before he visited Greece or the East, and followed his friend [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' in showing a recent incident in distant parts that had aroused public opinion. [[Greece]] was still fighting for independence from the Ottomans, and was effectively as exotic as the more Near Eastern parts of the empire. Delacroix followed up with ''[[Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi]]'' (1827), commemorating a siege of the previous year, and ''[[The Death of Sardanapalus]]'', inspired by [[Lord Byron]], which although set in antiquity has been credited with beginning the mixture of sex, violence, lassitude and exoticism which runs through much French Orientalist painting.&lt;ref&gt;Nochlin, 294–296; Tromans, 128&lt;/ref&gt; In 1832, Delacroix finally visited what is now [[Algeria]], recently conquered by the French, and [[Morocco]], as part of a diplomatic mission to the [[Sultan of Morocco]]. He was greatly struck by what he saw, comparing the North African way of life to that of the Ancient Romans, and continued to paint subjects from his trip on his return to France. Like many later Orientalist painters, he was frustrated by the difficulty of sketching women, and many of his scenes featured [[Jews]] or warriors on horses. However, he was apparently able to get into the women's' quarters or [[harem]] of a house to sketch what became ''[[Women of Algiers]]''; few later harem scenes had this claim to authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 81&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Le Bain Turc, by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|240px|Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, ''[[The Turkish Bath]]'', 1862]]
When Ingres, the director of the French ''Académie de peinture'', painted a highly colored vision of a ''[[Turkish bath]]'', he made his eroticized Orient publicly acceptable by his diffuse generalizing of the female forms (who might all have been the same model). More open sensuality was seen as acceptable in the exotic Orient.&lt;ref name="Tromans, 135"&gt;Tromans, 135&lt;/ref&gt; This imagery persisted in art into the early 20th century, as evidenced in [[Henri Matisse]]'s orientalist semi-nudes from his Nice period, and his use of Oriental costumes and patterns. Ingres' pupil [[Théodore Chassériau]] (1819–1856) had already achieved success with his nude ''[[The Toilette of Esther]]'' (1841, [[Louvre]]) and equestrian portrait of ''Ali-Ben-Hamet, Caliph of Constantine and Chief of the Haractas, Followed by his Escort'' (1846) before he first visited the East, but in later decades the [[steamship]] made travel much easier and increasing numbers of artists traveled to the Middle East and beyond, painting a wide range of Oriental scenes.

In many of these works, they portrayed the Orient as exotic, colorful and sensual, not to say [[stereotype]]d. Such works typically concentrated on Arab, Jewish, and other Semitic cultures, as those were the ones visited by artists as France became more engaged in North Africa. French artists such as [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] and [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] painted many works depicting Islamic culture, often including lounging [[odalisque]]s. They stressed both lassitude and visual spectacle. Other scenes, especially in [[genre painting]], have been seen as either closely comparable to their equivalents set in modern-day or historical Europe, or as also reflecting an Orientalist mind-set in the Saidian sense of the term. Gérôme was the precursor, and often the master, of a number of French painters in the later part of the century whose works were often frankly salacious, frequently featuring scenes in harems, public baths and slave auctions (the last two also available with classical decor), and responsible, with others, for "the equation of Orientalism with the nude in pornographic mode";&lt;ref&gt;Tromans. 136&lt;/ref&gt; (''Gallery, below'')

===British Orientalism===
[[File:William Holman Hunt 002.jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[William Holman Hunt]], ''A Street Scene in Cairo; The Lantern-Maker's Courtship'', 1854–61]]
Though British political interest in the territories of the unravelling Ottoman Empire was as intense as in France, it was mostly more discreetly exercised. The origins of British Orientalist 19th-century painting owe more to religion than military conquest or the search for plausible locations for naked women. The leading British [[genre painter]], [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]] was 55 when he travelled to [[Istanbul]] and [[Jerusalem]] in 1840, dying off [[Gibraltar]] during the return voyage. Though not noted as a religious painter, Wilkie made the trip with a [[Protestant]] agenda to reform religious painting, as he believed that: "a [[Martin Luther]] in painting is as much called for as in theology, to sweep away the abuses by which our divine pursuit is encumbered", by which he meant traditional Christian [[iconography]]. He hoped to find more authentic settings and decor for Biblical subjects at their original location, though his death prevented more than studies being made. Other artists including the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] had similar motivations,&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 14 (quoted), 162–165&lt;/ref&gt; giving an emphasis on realism in British Orientalist art from the start.&lt;ref&gt;Nochlin, 289, disputing Rosenthal assertion, and insisting that "there must be some attempt to clarify ''whose'' reality we are talking about".&lt;/ref&gt; The French artist [[James Tissot]] also used contemporary Middle Eastern landscape and decor for Biblical subjects, with little regard for historical costumes or other fittings.

William Holman Hunt produced a number of major paintings of Biblical subjects drawing on his Middle Eastern travels, improvising variants of contemporary Arab costume and furnishings to avoid specifically Islamic styles, and also some landscapes and genre subjects. The biblical subjects included ''[[The Scapegoat (painting)|The Scapegoat]]'' (1856), ''[[The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple]]'' (1860), and ''[[The Shadow of Death]]'' (1871). ''[[The Miracle of the Holy Fire (painting)|The Miracle of the Holy Fire]]'' (1899) was intended as a picturesque satire on the local Eastern Christians, of whom, like most English visitors, Hunt took a very dim view. His ''A Street Scene in Cairo; The Lantern-Maker's Courtship'' (1854–61) is a rare contemporary narrative scene, as the young man feels his fiancé's face, which he is not allowed to see, through her veil, as a Westerner in the background beats his way up the street with his stick.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 16–17 and see index&lt;/ref&gt; This a rare intrusion of a clearly contemporary figure into an Orientalist scene; mostly they claim the picturesqueness of the historical painting so popular at the time, without the trouble of researching authentic costumes and settings.

When Gérôme exhibited ''For Sale; Slaves at Cairo'' at the [[Royal Academy]] in London in 1871, it was "widely found offensive", perhaps partly because the British liked to think they had successfully suppressed the [[slave trade]] in Egypt, also for cruelty and "representing fleshiness for its own sake".&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; But Rana Kabbani believes that "French Orientalist painting, as exemplified by the works of Gérôme, may appear more sensual, gaudy, gory and sexually explicit than its British counterpart, but this is a difference of style not substance ... Similar strains of fascination and repulsion convulsed their artists"&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 43&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, nudity and violence are more evident in British paintings set in the ancient world, and "the iconography of the ''[[odalisque]]'' ... the Oriental [[sex slave]] whose image is offered up to the viewer as freely as she herself supposedly was to her master – is almost entirely French in origin",&lt;ref name="Tromans, 135"/&gt; though taken up with enthusiasm by Italian and other painters.

[[John Frederick Lewis]], who lived for several years in a traditional mansion in [[Cairo]], painted highly detailed works showing both realistic [[Genre painting|genre scenes]] of Middle Eastern life and more idealized scenes in upper class Egyptian interiors with no traces of Western cultural influence yet apparent. His careful and seemingly affectionate representation of Islamic architecture, furnishings, screens, and costumes set new standards of realism, which influenced other artists, including Gérôme in his later works. He "never painted a nude", and his wife modelled for several of his harem scenes,&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, quote 135; 134 on his wife; generally: 22–32, 80–85, 130–135, and see index&lt;/ref&gt; which, with the rare examples by the classicist painter [[Lord Leighton]], imagine "the harem as a place of almost English domesticity, ... [where]... women's fully clothed respectability suggests a moral healthiness to go with their natural good looks".&lt;ref name="Tromans, 135"/&gt;

Other artists concentrated on [[landscape painting]], often of desert scenes, including [[Richard Dadd]] and [[Edward Lear]]. [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] (1796–1864) produced architectural and landscape views, many of [[antiquities]], and published very successful books of [[lithograph]]s from them.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 102–125, covers landscape&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian Orientalist art was largely concerned with the areas of [[Central Asia]] that Russia was conquering during the century, and also in historical painting with the [[Mongol]]s who had dominated Russia for much of the Middle Ages, who were rarely shown in a good light. [[Nationalist]] historical painting in [[Central Europe]] and the [[Balkans]] dwelt on Turkish oppression, with [[battle scene]]s and maidens about to be raped.

The Saidian analysis has not prevented a strong revival of interest in, and collecting of, 19th century Orientalist works since the 1970s, the latter was in large part led by Middle Eastern buyers.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 7, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors and composers are not commonly referred to as "Orientalist" in the way that artists are, and relatively few specialized in Oriental topics or styles, or are even best known for their works including them. But many major figures, from Mozart to Flaubert, have produced significant works with Oriental subjects or treatments. [[Lord Byron]] with his four long "Turkish tales" in poetry, is one of the most important writers to make exotic fantasy Oriental settings a significant theme in the literature of [[Romanticism]]. Verdi's opera ''Aida'' (1871) is set in Egypt as portrayed through the content and the visual spectacle. "Aida" depicts a militaristic Egypt's tyranny over Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Beard and Gloag 2005, 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish Orientalism had a particular character, drawing on various beliefs about early historical links between Ireland and the East, few of which are now regarded as historically correct. The mythical [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]] are one example of this. The Irish were also conscious of the views of other nations seeing them as comparably backward to the East, and Europe's "backyard Orient".&lt;ref&gt;Lennon, Joseph. "Irish Orientalism," New York: Syracuse University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===In music===
In music, Orientalism may be applied to styles occurring in different periods, such as the ''alla Turca'', used by multiple composers including [[Mozart]] and [[Beethoven]].&lt;ref name="Beard and Gloag 2005, 129"&gt;Beard and Gloag 2005, 129&lt;/ref&gt; The American musicologist [[Richard Taruskin]] has identified in 19th-century Russian music a strain of Orientalism: "the East as a sign or metaphor, as imaginary geography, as historical fiction, as the reduced and totalized other against which we construct our (not less reduced and totalized) sense of ourselves".&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (1997): p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Taruskin concedes Russian composers, unlike those in France and Germany, felt an "ambivalence" to the theme since "Russia was a contiguous empire in which Europeans, living side by side with 'orientals', identified (and intermarried) with them far more than in the case of other colonial powers".&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (1997): p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Taruskin characterizes Orientalism in Romantic Russian music as having melodies "full of close little ornaments and melismas",&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (1997): p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; chromatic accompanying lines, drone bass&lt;ref name="taruskin165"&gt;Taruskin (1997): p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;—characteristics which were used by [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]], [[Mily Balakirev|Balakirev]], [[Alexander Borodin|Borodin]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Sergei Lyapunov|Lyapunov]], and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninov]]. These musical characteristics evoke "not just the East, but the seductive East that emasculates, enslaves, renders passive. In a word, it signifies the promise of the experience of ''nega'', a prime attribute of the orient as imagined by the Russians. ... In opera and song, ''nega'' often simply denotes S-E-X a la russe, desired or achieved."&lt;ref name="taruskin165" /&gt;

Orientalism is also traceable in music that is considered to have effects of [[exoticism]], including the ''[[japonisme]]'' in [[Claude Debussy]]'s piano music all the way to the [[sitar]] being used in recordings by [[the Beatles]].&lt;ref name="Beard and Gloag 2005, 129"/&gt;

===In literature===
The Romantic movement in literature began in 1785 and ended around 1830. The term "Romantic" references the ideas and culture that writers of the time reflected in their work. During this time, the culture and objects of the East began to have a profound effect on Europe. Extensive traveling by artists and members of the European elite brought travelogues and sensational tales back to the West creating a great interest in all things "foreign". Romantic Orientalism incorporates African and Asian geographic locations, well-known colonial and "native" personalities, folklore, and philosophies to create a literary environment of colonial exploration from a distinctly European worldview. The current trend in analysis of this movement references a belief in this literature as a mode to justify European colonial endeavors with the expansion of territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Romantic Orientalism: Overview|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/romantic/topic_4/welcome.htm|website=The Norton Anthology of English Literature|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his novel ''[[Salammbô (novel)|Salammbô]]'', [[Gustave Flaubert]] used ancient [[Carthage]] in North Africa as a [[foil (literature)|foil]] to ancient [[Rome]]. He portrayed its culture as morally corrupting and suffused with dangerously alluring eroticism. This novel proved hugely influential on later portrayals of ancient [[Semitic cultures]].

===In film===
Said argues that the continuity of Orientalism into the present can be found in influential images, particularly through the [[Cinema of the United States]], as the West has now grown to include the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Geographies of Postcolonialism|last = Sharp|first = Joanne|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] feature film, such as the ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' series, ''[[The Mummy (franchise)|The Mummy]]'' films, and Disney's ''[[Aladdin (franchise)|Aladdin]]'' film series demonstrate the imagined geographies of the East.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The films usually portray the lead heroic characters as being from the Western world, while the villains often come from the East.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The representation of the Orient has continued in film, although this representation does not necessarily have any truth to it.

The overly sexualized character of [[Princess Jasmine]] in ''Aladdin'' is simply a continuation of the paintings from the 19th century, where women were represented as erotic, sexualized male fantasies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Geographies of postcolonialism|last = Sharp|first = Joanne|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Teahouse of the August Moon (film)|The Tea House of the August Moon]]'' (1956), as argued by Pedro Iacobelli, there are tropes of orientalism. He notes, that the film "tells us more about the Americans and the American's image of Okinawa rather than about the Okinawan people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Iacobelli | first =  Pedro
 | year = 2011
 | title = Orientalism, Mass Culture and the US Administration in Okinawa

 | issue = 4 | pages = 19–38
}} &lt;/ref&gt;The film characterizes the Okinawans as "merry but backward" and "de-politicized", which ignored the real-life Okinawan political protests over forceful land acquisition by the American military at the time.

Kimiko Akita, in "Orientalism and the Binary of Fact and Fiction in Memoirs of a Geisha", argues that ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Memoirs of a Geisha]]'' (2005) contains orientalist tropes and deep "cultural misrepresentations". She states that ''Memoirs of a Geish]'' "reinforces the idea of Japanese culture and geisha as exotic, backward, irrational, dirty, profane, promiscuous, bizarre, and enigmatic".

===In dance===
During the Romantic Period of the 19th century, [[ballet]] developed a preoccupation with the exotic. This exoticism ranged from ballets set in Scotland to those based on ethereal creatures. By the later part of the century, ballets were capturing the presumed essence of the mysterious East. These ballets often included sexual themes and tended to be based on assumptions of people rather than on concrete facts. Orientalism is apparent in numerous ballets.

The Orient motivated several major ballets, which have survived since the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. ''Le Corsaire'' premiered in 1856 at the Paris Opera, with choreography by [[Joseph Mazilier]].&lt;ref name="abt corsaire"&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Corsaire|url=http://www.abt.org/education/archive/ballets/corsairefl.html|website=ABT|publisher=Ballet Theatre Foundation, Inc.|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marius Petipa]] re-choreographed the ballet for the Maryinsky Ballet in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1899.&lt;ref name="abt corsaire" /&gt; Its complex storyline, loosely based on Lord Byron's poem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Au|first1=Susan|title=Ballet and Modern Dance|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; takes place in Turkey and focuses on a love story between a pirate and a beautiful slave girl. Scenes include a bazaar where women are sold to men as slaves, and the Pasha's Palace, which features his harem of wives.&lt;ref name="abt corsaire" /&gt; In 1877, Marius Petipa choreographed ''La Bayadere'', the love story of an Indian temple dancer and Indian warrior. This ballet was based on Kalidasa's play ''Sakuntala''.&lt;ref name=Au&gt;{{cite book|last1=Au|first1=Susan|title=Ballet and Modern Dance|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson, Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Bayadere'' used vaguely Indian costuming, and incorporated Indian inspired hand gestures into classical ballet. In addition, it included a 'Hindu Dance,' motivated by Kathak, an Indian dance form.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; Another ballet, ''Sheherazade'', choreographed by Michel Fokine in 1910 to music by Nicholas Rimsky-Korsakov, is a story involving a shah's wife and her illicit relations with a Golden Slave, originally played by Vaslav Nijinsky.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; The ballet's controversial fixation on sex includes an orgy in an oriental harem. When the shah discovers the actions of his numerous wives and their lovers, he orders the deaths of those involved.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; ''Sheherazade'' was loosely based on folktales of questionable authenticity.

Several lesser-known ballets of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century also reveal Orientalism. For instance, in Petipa's ''Pharaoh's Daughter'' (1862), an Englishman imagines himself, in an opium-induced dream, as an Egyptian boy who wins the love of the Pharaoh's daughter, Aspicia.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; Aspicia's costume consisted of 'Egyptian' décor on a tutu.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; Another ballet, Hippolyte Monplaisir's ''Brahma'', which premiered in 1868 in La Scala, Italy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jowitt|first1=Deborah|title=Time and the Dancing Image|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a story that involves romantic relations between a slave girl and Brahma, the Hindu god, when he visits earth.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; In addition, in 1909, Serge Diagilev included ''Cleopatra'' in Ballet's Russe's repertory. With its theme of sex, this revision of Fokine's ''Une Nuit d' Egypte'' combined the "exoticism and grandeur" that audiences of this time craved.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt;

As one of the pioneers of modern dance in America, [[Ruth St Denis]] also explored Orientalism in her dancing. Her dances were not authentic; she drew inspiration from photographs, books, and later from museums in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Au|first1=Susan|title=Ballet and modern Dance|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson, Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the exoticism of her dances catered to the interests of society women in America.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; She included ''Radha'' and ''The Cobras'' in her 'Indian' program in 1906. In addition, she found success in Europe with another Indian-themed ballet, ''The Nautch'' in 1908. In 1909, upon her return to America, St Denis created her first 'Egyptian' work, ''Egypta''.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; Her preference for Orientalism continued, culminating with ''Ishtar of the Seven Gates'' in 1923, about a Babylonian goddess.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt;

While Orientalism in dance climaxed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it is still present in modern times. For instance, major ballet companies regularly perform ''Le Corsaire'', ''La Bayadere'', and ''Sheherazade''. Furthermore, Orientalism is also found within newer versions of ballets. In versions of ''The Nutcracker'', such as the 2010 [[American Ballet Theatre]] production, the Chinese dance uses an arm position with the arms bent at a ninety-degree angle and the index fingers pointed upwards, while the Arabian dance uses two dimensional bent arm movements. Inspired by ballets of the past, stereotypical 'Oriental' movements and arm positions have developed and remain.

An exchange of Western and Eastern ideas about spirituality developed as the West traded with and established colonies in Asia.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} The first Western translation of a Sanskrit text appeared in 1785,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=176}} marking the growing interest in Indian culture and languages.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=177}} Translations of the ''Upanishads'', which [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] called "the consolation of my life", first appeared in 1801 and 1802.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=177-178}}{{refn|group=note|Schopenhauer also called his poodle "Atman".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=178}}}} Early translations also appeared in other European languages.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=183-184}} 19th-century [[transcendentalism]] was influenced by Asian spirituality, prompting [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (1803–1882) to pioneer the idea of spirituality as a distinct field.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Leigh Eric. ''Restless Souls: The Making of American Spirituality''. San Francisco: Harper, 2005. {{ISBN|0-06-054566-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major force in the mutual influence of Eastern and Western [[spirituality]] and religiosity was the [[Theosophical Society]],{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=185-188}}{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} a group searching for ancient wisdom from the East and spreading Eastern religious ideas in the West.{{sfn|Lavoie|2012}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} One of its salient features was the belief in "[[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom (Theosophy)|Masters of Wisdom]]",{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Ascended Master Teachings]]}} "beings, human or once human, who have transcended the normal frontiers of knowledge, and who make their wisdom available to others".{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}} The Theosophical Society also spread Western ideas in the East, contributing to its modernisation and a growing nationalism in the Asian colonies.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}

"Re-Orientalism differs from Orientalism in its manner of and reasons for referencing the West: while challenging the metanarratives of Orientalism, re-Orientalism sets up alternative metanarratives of its own in order to articulate eastern identities, simultaneously deconstructing and reinforcing Orientalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendes|first=Ana Cristina|last2=Lau|first2=Lisa|date=December 2014|title=India through re-Orientalist Lenses|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F1369801X.2014.984619|journal=Interventions|language=en|volume=17|issue=5|pages=706–727|doi=10.1080/1369801x.2014.984619|issn=1369-801X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[Occidentalism]]" is often used to refer to negative views of the Western world found in Eastern societies and is founded on the sense of nationalism that spread in reaction to colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url =http://www.erudit.org/revue/jcha/2006/v17/n2/016587ar.pdf |title = Edward Said: Orientalism and Occidentalism|last = Lary|first = Diana|date = 2006|journal = Journal of the Canadian Historical Association / Revue de la Société historique du Canada|volume = 17| number = 2 |p = 3–15|doi = 10.7202/016587ar|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The action of "[[othering]]" cultures occurs when groups are labeled as different due to characteristics that distinguish them from the perceived norm.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Other|last = Mountz|first = Alison|date = |journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Said]], the author of the book ''Orientalism'', argued that western powers and influential individuals such as social scientists and artists othered "the Orient".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The evolution of ideologies is often initially embedded in the language, and continues to ripple through the fabric of society by taking over the culture, economy and political sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Orientalism at Home: The Case of 'Canada's Toughest Neighbourhood'|last = Richardson|first = Chris|date = 2014|journal = Project Muse|volume = 27|pages = 75|doi = 10.3828/bjcs.2014.5|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Said's criticism of Western Orientalism is based on what he describes as articularizing trends. These ideologies are present in Asian works by Indian, Chinese, and Japanese writers and artists, in their views of Western culture and tradition.

A particularly significant development is the manner in which Orientalism has taken shape in non-Western cinema, as for instance in Hindi cinema.

Said has been accused of Occidentalizing the west in his critique Orientalism, ''i.e.'' of being guilty of falsely characterizing the West in the same way that he accuses Western scholars of falsely characterizing the East.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Geographies of Postcolonialism|last = Sharp|first = Jo|publisher = Sage|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-4129-0778-1|location = London|pages = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Said essentialized the west by creating a homogeneous image of the area. Currently, the west consists not only of Europe, but also the United States, which has become more influential and dominant over the years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Post-socialist art''' (or post-communist art) is a term used in analysis of art arriving from post-socialist (post-communist) countries taken as different in their nature from Western, [[Postmodern art]].

Crucial for such art is that:
# Because of having no market of art such art was Modernist in a sense of being non-commercial (Groys, 2004), but also;
# Having no market of art authorship was weakened authorship allowed working under pseudonyms, anonymously or even collectively (Peraica, 2006); and finally;
# Such art was necessary referring to the inner history of art, as commonly to Russian Avantgard [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[El Lissitzky]]

Socialist art started opening to Western markets already in the eighties, introducing Slovenian collective [[IRWIN]], Belgrade Malevich (aka Goran Djordjevic) and other artists [[Peter Weibel]] named Retro-avantgard. In the second wave of nineties it was followed by a weakened political versions which were massively funded (Most of such art was financed by [[George Soros]], similarly to [[Socialist realism]] which Lead thinkers as Miško Šuvaković to name such art [[Soros Realism]].

'''Postgraduate research''' represents a formal area of study that is recognized by a university or institute of higher learning. By definition, the notion of “postgraduate” ([[United States]]) carries the implication that the candidate undertaking such research has already completed a formal [[Master's degree]] and at some instances the [[Doctor of Philosophy |PhD]], at an accredited university or tertiary institution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uniguru.co.in/studyabroad/postgraduate/us-usa/all-university-courses/harvard-university-courses/72040/1/programs.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting qualifications arising from postgraduate research leads to Post ([[Doctorate]]s).&lt;ref&gt;http://cambridge.net/us/harvard-academics-courses-research/&lt;/ref&gt;
  
==Structure==
The structure of postgraduate research programs can vary significantly from one country to another.  To enter into a PhD program in the United States, students generally must have some form of prerequisite study beyond their basic graduate qualification. This may be a Master’s coursework program, which acts as a qualifier for entry.  In other countries, entry to Doctoral or Master’s research programs is based on the academic track record of the candidates in their undergraduate degrees.

Many students confuse the notion of postgraduate research with “invention” and “discovery”.  Postgraduate research ultimately represents an apprenticeship in the field of research.  In his textbook,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doctortee.net/KeyFactors.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''Key Factors in Postgraduate Research – A Guide for Students''. Dario Toncich explains that the objective of postgraduate research is not necessarily to make a breakthrough invention or, indeed, a major scientific discovery.  

It is, rather, a mechanism by which graduate students learn how to undertake a systematic investigation, founded upon the work built by peers in the field, and then to extend the current state of knowledge.  In the context of assessing a postgraduate research program, it is generally the systematic process of research and investigation that is given more attention than the level to which knowledge is extended.  The title "doctor" emanates from the Latin word ''docera''&amp;mdash;to teach.  Hence there is an expectation that the recipient of a doctorate would go on to become some form of "teacher" in the broad sense of the word.&lt;ref&gt;http://icmr.nic.in/ifc_research.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 19th century, postgraduate research was a rarity, with countries such as the United States only having a small number of candidates across their university spectrum.  However, by the start of the 21st century, postgraduate research, and postgraduate qualifications, had become commonplace.  In any one year, at a global level, there are hundreds of thousands of candidates undertaking postgraduate research programs.  For this reason the nature of postgraduate research has also changed.  

At Doctoral level, there is some recognition that it is no longer reasonable to expect major research breakthroughs as part of a postgraduate research program.  To this end, Doctoral research more commonly now represents an extension of knowledge, rather than some form of breakthrough.  There is also some recognition that modern postgraduate research programs now have to be conducted in the light of massive amounts of previously published work, and hence the [[literature review]] process has become significantly more complex.

The nomenclature associated with titles arising from postgraduate research vary from one institution to another and one country to another. Postgraduate research programs generally result in a thesis/dissertation, which is assessed by independent experts in the field.  The specific nature of the thesis varies from one discipline to another and from one country to another.  In addition, some universities insist that students also undertake a ''viva-voce'' oral examination in which they can defend their research and processes before an expert panel.

In [[India]], generally, the higher the level of the research degree the less association it has with a specific discipline.  For example, at Bachelor's level, it would be common to receive a [[Bachelor of Science |BS]]c(Chemistry).  At Master's level, the corresponding degree would be an MSc (without the specific subdiscipline).  At Doctoral level, the degree would be simply PhD with no discipline stated.  This is intended to show that the recipient of the award has mastered techniques that are more generic than those encapsulated in a specific discipline or subdiscipline.  There are some exceptions to this.  In a professional Doctorate, where the objective is to demonstrate an in-depth research knowledge of a particular area, the discipline is usually included (e.g., Doctor of Business).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isb.edu/fpm/ProgrammeStructure.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In some universities, it is also possible for candidates to achieve what is referred to as a "higher doctorate".  This is generally an award bestowed upon people who have made a substantial contribution to their discipline through their research.  Higher doctorates would normally be awarded after a significant research career and therefore those who receive such awards generally already have a basic PhD to begin with.  Like professional doctorates, higher doctorates generally carry the title of the discipline to which the research contributions have been made&amp;mdash;for example, Doctor of Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.be.seas.upenn.edu/prospective-students/doctoral/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2811">A '''puppet ruler''' is a person who has a title indicating possession of [[political power]], but who, in reality, is controlled by outside individuals or forces.  Such outside power can be exercised by a foreign government, in which case the puppet ruler's domain is called a [[puppet state]].  But the puppet ruler may also be controlled by internal forces, such as non-elected officials.

== Examples ==
=== In Latin America ===
Governing through puppet presidents has long been a political tactic in [[Latin America]]. Many dictators and strongmen have formally handed over power to other officials for several reasons, often in order to follow constitutional provisions for elections and term limits, to provide a civilian façade for military rule, or to be able to go into semi-retirement away from the capital city. Strongmen who sometimes governed through figureheads included [[Diego Portales]] of [[Chile]], [[Rafael Núñez (politician)|Rafael Núñez]] of [[Colombia]], [[Tomás Guardia Gutiérrez]] of [[Costa Rica]], [[Fulgencio Batista]] of [[Cuba]], [[Ulises Heureaux]] and [[Rafael Trujillo]] of the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Gabriel García Moreno]] of [[Ecuador]], [[Raoul Cédras]] of [[Haiti]], [[Porfirio Díaz]] and [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] of [[Mexico]], the [[Somoza family]] of [[Nicaragua]], [[José Antonio Remón Cantera]], [[Omar Torrijos]] and [[Manuel Noriega]] of [[Panama]], [[Dési Bouterse]] of [[Suriname]], and [[Antonio Guzmán Blanco]] and [[Juan Vicente Gómez]] of [[Venezuela]]. While figureheads who decided to act autonomously were often dismissed, on rare occasions the "puppets" later became significant political figures in their own right. For example, [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] turned against and exiled Calles to the United States and [[Joaquín Balaguer]] was elected to the Dominican presidency six times after the assassination of Trujillo.
=== Elsewhere ===

A puppet does not have to be a national ruler.  For example, [[Oscar K. Allen]] was widely recognized to be [[Huey Long]]'s puppet while serving as governor of [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5107&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Interwar period|the years before]] and during [[World War II]], [[Puyi]], the deposed [[Emperor of China]], is usually considered to have been the [[Emperor of Manchukuo|puppet ruler of]] [[Manchukuo]], a [[client state]] of the [[Empire of Japan]] on the Chinese mainland. &lt;ref&gt;Pu Yi 1988, p 281&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pu Yi 1988, p 298&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Win Myint (politician)|Win Myint]], the current [[President of Myanmar|president]] of [[Myanmar]], is widely viewed by political commentators as a puppet president for [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], who is constitutionally barred from holding the office of president.

A '''quickie''' refers to a brief or spontaneous episode of [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], with the act finishing in a very short amount of time.

Generally, the term presupposes that [[foreplay]] is skipped and that at least one of the partners [[orgasm|climaxes]]. A quickie may involve [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] or be limited to [[manual sex|manual]] or [[oral sex]].&lt;ref name="Cutrer"/&gt; A quickie between a heterosexual couple may generally satisfy only the man's desire,&lt;ref name="Cutrer"&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3852">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Roman de la Rose'' Digital Library}}
The '''''Roman de la Rose'' Digital Library'''  (''Rose'' DL) is a joint project of the [[Johns Hopkins University#Libraries|Sheridan Libraries]] of the [[Johns Hopkins University]] and the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]. The goal of the ''Rose'' DL is to create an online library of all manuscripts containing the 13th-century poem ''[[Roman de la Rose]]''. The library currently displays digital surrogates of more than 140 ''Roman de la Rose'' manuscripts, and the collection continues to grow. The entire collection is freely available to the public for scholarly research and personal use.

==History==
This project first began in 1996 when [http://grll.jhu.edu/french/bios/stephen-nichols/ Stephen G. Nichols], James M. Beall Professor of French and Chair of the [http://grll.jhu.edu/ Romance Languages and Literatures Department] at Johns Hopkins University, approached staff at the Milton S. Eisenhower Library about digitizing ''Roman de la Rose'' manuscripts for teaching purposes. After receiving funding from Ameritech Library Services, the [http://www.getty.edu/grants/ Getty Grant Program], the [http://www.kressfoundation.org/ Samuel H. Kress Foundation], and the [http://www.delmas.org/ Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation], the Eisenhower Library created the prototype ''Roman de la Rose: Digital Surrogates of Medieval Manuscripts'', which came to include six ''Rose'' manuscripts from various libraries in the US and UK. The original library contained manuscripts from the [[Walters Art Museum]] in Baltimore, the [[Morgan Library]] in New York, the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] in Los Angeles, and the [[Bodleian Library]] in Oxford.

In 2007, the Bibliothèque nationale de France and the ''Rose'' DL began a partnership to digitize all the ''Rose'' manuscripts held in Paris and in municipal and university libraries in France for the site. With funding from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], this joint project makes available about half of the roughly 300 ''Rose'' manuscripts known to be extant.

==Features==
All page images in the digital library may be viewed in a page turner application or in an image browsing format. Researchers may pan on a page or zoom down to a high degree of magnification. In addition to the images themselves, the ''Rose'' DL provides metadata that supports the research process. Many of the manuscripts have detailed manuscript descriptions that provide information about the history of the manuscript and about its physical characteristics such as binding, quire structure, material, and decoration. Full transcriptions exist for a few manuscripts and illustration descriptions are available for many.

It is often difficult to find the same narrative section in multiple manuscripts since they differ in line length, number of columns, and number of lines on a leaf. To get around this, the ''Rose'' DL includes a [http://romandelarose.org/#sections narrative sections tool] that approximates the start and finish of each section. These are usually accurate to within two columns.

'''Sandra Cabrera''' (27 October 1970 – 27 January 2004) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] street-based sex worker, trade unionist, and campaigner for sex worker rights. She was killed in 2004 when her anti-corruption efforts started being successful and threatened police corruption networks and her defense of street workers' rights threatened brothel owners.

Her first contact with [[Association of Women Sex Workers in Argentina in Action for Our Rights|AMMAR]] (Association of Women Prostitutes of Argentina) occurred in 2000, but she didn't begin working with the union until 2001.

{{ quote | text= I was working in a corner of the Terminal area and a group of pimps and bouncers from a bar in the area beat me up pretty badly.

During Argentina's economic crisis in 2001, Cabrera discovered the power of  union association. She complained publicly that the lack of cash had left the women on the street desperately poor, to the point of not knowing if they would have food for their families on Christmas. The Ministry of Social Advancement gave the union sacks of food that Cabrera distributed,&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; working from 8 in the morning to 10 at night.

{{ quote | text= "There were many women who had nothing to eat, so we started to manage food boxes and work plans... At 10:30 pm my daughter and I fell asleep and when I woke up the other day I worried because we had not celebrated Christmas, but she (her daughter Macarena, 7 years old) told me not to worry about it, because thanks to what we had done the day before, many of our companions had something to celebrate.
| author= Sandra Cabrera&lt;ref name="luchadora"/&gt; 
}}

Cabrera seems to have been a devoted mother to the daughter she called "Maca". She encouraged her education and ensured that she learned computer skills. She took her to the theater. At the time of the murder, Macarena was away at a scouting camp in Mendoza.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

Cabrera's work to stop the spread of [[AIDS]] and other STDs began in October, 2001.

{{ quote | text= The word of someone unknown is not the same as one of us talking to our colleagues, with our language, explaining how to take care of ourselves through our experience.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;


There are women who did not know how to protect themselves when they [clients] ask for a ''francesa'' [oral sex]... We have a manual with pictures of healthy vaginas next to diseased vaginas, healthy penises next to diseased penises, because for us things also enter our eyes.&lt;ref name="luchadora"/&gt; 
| author= Sandra Cabrera
}}

Lacking resources for its own place, AMMAR's Rosario chapter maintained an office with the Government Workers Association, where the AMMAR women were known affectionately as "the Sanjua gang", after Cabrera's place of origin.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; Cabrera reportedly had a love/hate relationship with AMMAR's national leadership. Her interactions with Elena Reynaga, Secretary General of the union at the time, have been described as "explosive".&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; Reynaga acknowledged that no one she worked with fought her as Cabrera did, 
&lt;ref name="frente"&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
but she also acknowledged Cabrera's effectiveness:

{{ quote 
| text= She cared about the others, the injustices spurred her on, she got what she wanted.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;
| author= Elena Reynaga 
}}

Organizing gave her a position in a social network that she couldn't get any other way.

{{ quote 
| text= She was very lacking in [i.e. hadn't received] affection, like so many of us. In the organization she began to find something we all seek, to be recognized for something and to be important.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

}}

And in Rosario, she found that recognition.

{{ quote
| text= We admire her strength, how she achieves things for us. It makes us think that if we unite we can aspire to a retirement, to a more dignified life.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;
| author= Rosario sex worker

She was the consummate union organizer. For two years before her murder, she used her motorcycle to take her every place in [[Rosario]] where her colleagues were working the street, listening to their complaints and planning how to use the union to protect them.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; After she died this was how many people remembered her; on her bike, distributing condoms, asking about people's problems.&lt;ref name="frente"/&gt; She learned how to make statements to the news media that the media would pick up and publish, spreading her message.

}}

Perhaps Cabrera's hardest task was just persuading her colleagues that a union was possible. Claudia Lucero, her close friend, sometime dancing partner, godmother of her daughter, and eventual successor as secretary general of the [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] chapter of AMMAR, had to be won over.

{{ quote 
| text= When she proposed it, I did not want to know anything. I told her it was crazy, that it could not be that we had a union, because we had never had anything. Society always had us as the lowest, for me it was like we did not exist. When the crisis came in late 2001, Sandra got social plans. There I started to go to the headquarters of the Central of Argentine Workers (CTA), but still thought that we could not get to where we arrived today. When I started to go, I met all the union guys who treated us differently, they said 'how are you, girls.' There I began to realize that we were not what they had made us believe. Because we suffered so much repression, the police made us believe that we were nobody. There I realized that it was not so.&lt;ref name="frente"/&gt;
| author= Claudia Lucero
}}

Other street workers had other reasons for not joining. Stella Maris Longoni found it easier just to pay her police extortionist fifty pesos a week and be left in peace, until the day she paid and the police arrested her anyway. Released from jail, with police warnings not to join the union still ringing in her ears, she went straight to Cabrera and AMMAR.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

During Sandra Cabrera's murder investigation, a source inside the investigation told a news reporter that Cabrera had been defending herself on three fronts: the violence and risk of working on the street, the assaults arranged by the brothel businesses she and her independent street colleagues were competing with, and the harassment and threats from the police whose graft networks she was disrupting.&lt;ref name="olor"/&gt; The corrupt connection between the brothel owners and the police meant that Cabrera's struggle to protect street workers was necessarily a struggle against corruption.

By way of background, the journalist Carlos del Frade has described a meeting in 1991 between Rodolfo Enrique Riegé, Secretary of Public Security for the province of Santa Fe, and Atilio Bléfari, head of police in Rosario. Riegé informed Bléfari that if he didn't increase the graft revenues that he was paying to Riegé, Riegé would relieve him of command and force him to retire. The resulting struggle for control of the city of [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] was not a struggle between justice and corruption, but a struggle between a corrupt police officer and his even more corrupt superior. The document that del Frade cites as a source goes on to list the sources of extralegal income the police were collecting, which included theft of goods during transport, bank robbery, car theft, gambling, exploitation of juveniles in nightclubs and discos, and medical quackery, among other things. Category number two was income from the Public Morality units of the police, and included

Since the nightclubs and discos were fronts for brothels, this can be summarized as drugs and prostitution.

As part of her campaign for sex worker rights, Cabrera fought for the elimination of the articles of the provincial Misdemeanor Code that criminalized prostitution.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; Different officers in Rosario's Public Morality unit were able to use the Code to play different sides. Some officers were paid by the brothel owners to enforce the Code against the street workers who were competing with the brothels. Other officers collected bribes from street workers for not enforcing the Code.

Another complication was her romantic involvement with an officer of the Federal police, Diego Parvlucyk. She acted as an informant and he gave her drugs that had been seized during police operations, which she sold. Initially her connection with the Federal police seemed to give her some protection from the provincial police, or at least a feeling of protection, but the relationship with Parvlucyk became more difficult and he was later arrested for her murder, although released and never tried.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; For many of Argentina's sex workers, this relationship didn't seem unusual.

From 1999 to 2002, there is record of ten formal complaints made by Cabrera against the police. Most of them involve harassment or threats against her or a colleague.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt;

On March 4, 2003, Marcela Patricia Morelli, a street sex worker and member of AMMAR, filed a complaint against officers of the Ludueña neighborhood police station. She and two trans sex workers had been detained by the officers in what she felt was an excessive manner and with "a humiliating treatment". One of the trans sex workers was released after two hours, but Morelli and the other remained for more than six hours. The police removed money and clothing from the other trans sex worker, humiliated the person, and left the person lying on the floor, naked. In the morning the station chief arrived and told them that he didn't want "male or female prostitutes" in his jurisdiction, and threatened more violent measures. He threatened to drag Morelli by her hair if he saw her again.&lt;ref name="matar"/&gt;

As leader of AMMAR's Rosario chapter, Cabrera made the following statements.

{{ quote
| text= We are asking for security. We are fed up with being presented to the merchants of the neighborhoods as sources of insecurity, when many times the presence of prostitutes has avoided robberies.

We know that we are at fault and do not refuse to be delayed by the police in routine checks, but most of us have school-age children and we have already talked to government ministry personnel so we will not be detained in days during the school year, in order to send our children to school.

These things are repeated every time there are changes of leadership in the sections. When we are stopped we do not refuse to show the latest test results for HIV, despite the fact that the National AIDS Act, 23,798, guarantees the confidentiality of those results.&lt;ref name="matar"/&gt;

On September 10, 2003, Cabrera organized a formal complaint against the chief and deputy chief of the Public Morality unit of the police, accusing them of harassing sex workers at the stops near the Rosario Bus Terminal in order to protect brothels in the area from competition from independent street workers. An investigation turned up evidence that they were providing protection for a brothel whose women included underage girls and women trafficked from the Dominican Republic. The complaint also accused police officers of forcing street-based sex workers to pay bribes in order to work. The chief and deputy chief were removed, and the new head of the Public Morality section was a woman, nominally chosen to ensure that the corrupt practices ended,&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; but perhaps in reality chosen to take the pressure off without actually changing anything.&lt;ref name="olor"/&gt; Not quite five months later, when Cabrera was murdered, the disgraced ex-chief of Public Morality had been reassigned as head of the Zavalla police station.

Following the complaint, some of the bars the two police chiefs had been protecting closed, and a few others stopped making payments to the police. One of the sex workers who joined Cabrera in the complaint testified during the murder investigation that Cabrera had expressed fear that the police would retaliate.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt; 

On October 9, someone called the headquarters of the Government Workers Association, where AMMAR kept an office, and said "Tell Sandra that the girl will die before tomorrow." The girl was Cabrera's eight year old daughter, Macarena. From then until shortly before Cabrera's murder, the police Personal Security unit kept a nightly guard on her home.&lt;ref name="matar"/&gt;

A few days later, an anonymous complaint filed in the juvenile courts claimed that "Sandra sent the girl to beg and did not go to school." A social worker investigated and confirmed that Macarena had, in fact, been going to school.&lt;ref name="matar"/&gt;

On October 17 a sex worker was assaulted by a cyclist who struck her strongly in the head with a chain. The women went to the police and together they searched the area, but her assailant was never found.&lt;ref name="matar"/&gt;

At some point, while the police guard was temporarily away from Cabrera's home, someone got in and beat her.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; At another point, two men got into her home, put a gun to the head of her dog, and told her to stop fucking with them.&lt;ref name="aUnAno"/&gt;

The last complaint Cabrera helped file, four days before her murder, involved an officer who charged a woman fifty pesos a week for the privilege of working without trouble from the police. In spite of punctual payments, the woman was arrested by the Public Morality police, who informed her that the officer she was paying was no longer working in that division. When she announced that she was going to join AMMAR, the Morality police threatened her with daily arrests. Cabrera went with her to file an extortion complaint and was with her when she spoke to the news media. Cabrera told a reporter that she was afraid that someone from the Public Morality unit would come back for her.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

During her murder investigation, the investigating judge found evidence of fifteen death threats against her.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt;

=== Evidence ===
Testimony indicates that Sandra Cabrera was standing at her usual corner with a colleague at around 4:30 on the morning of 27 January 2004. She was approached by a client and walked toward him, away from her colleague. The colleague never saw the man's face and didn't recognize him. From behind, he appeared to be tall and thin, in light shorts. Cabrera and the client left together to go to her home.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt;

She was found dead from a shot in the back of the neck.&lt;ref name=nswp/&gt; The investigation determined that the muzzle of the gun had been pushed against her neck and the gun was partially supported by her skull when it was fired.

Her body was two blocks from the Omnibus Terminal,&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; one block from the stop where she worked.

There were no scuff marks on her sandals or clothes, indicating that she had not been dragged, but had been killed where she was found.&lt;ref name="zorro"/&gt; The bullet that killed her has been sometimes reported to be a 9 mm,&lt;ref name=nswp/&gt; but news reports at the time of the investigation said the investigators found a .32 caliber slug.&lt;ref name="zorro"/&gt; (Various police departments in Argentina have issued 9 mm handguns to their officers ([[Bersa Thunder 9]]), but the .32 caliber bullet is considered too small for police work.)

Her pants were pulled down below her hips but her underpants were in their normal position. A condom wrapper was found next to her body.&lt;ref name="olor"/&gt;
The police lab found semen in her vaginal and anal cavities.&lt;ref name="marcha"/&gt; Testimony indicated that she had had sex with her lover a couple of hours before she was last seen alive.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt;

Analysis by forensic experts suggests a planned assassination, not a spur-of-the-moment crime of passion. Her killer was probably either familiar with the area, or had cased it ahead of time, and led her to the entry of a private house where they were less likely to be observed. The murder weapon was a small caliber handgun that was easier to hide than the larger handguns issued by police departments. The killer apparently knew how to use a smaller weapon to ensure that Cabrera was killed by one shot, without the need for a second. The forensic analysts believe that he stood behind her, held her head with his left hand, forced the muzzle of the gun against her neck, and fired while standing with his knees slightly flexed. She died instantly.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt;

The forensic report concluded:

{{ quote
| text= The possibility is raised of a killer who has chosen circumstances of time and place, has killed at the right moment of least resistance of the victim, has held the corpse so that it does not strike with suddenness when falling and has left without leaving evidence of his presence. The hypothesis speaks of a professional profile of the victimizer with knowledge in the area, the habits of the victim and the task to be performed. Likewise the neatness of their movements must be considered. This consideration offers the probable alternative that the assailant knew the victim during a previous encounter provoked precisely to obtain data of habits and circumstances in which the victim moved.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt; }}

=== Reaction ===
Her murder was a shock to the national political system. Almost immediately the national Minister of Justice got in touch with the [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]] governor, and the Secretary for National Human Rights came to [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] to get involved in the case. Within two days the investigating judge had convened a multi-disciplinary meeting at the Institute of Forensic Medicine with ten forensic experts; an extraordinary step in any murder case, much less a case involving a street-based sex worker.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigating judge laid out three lines of investigation: she was killed by a client, she was killed by the brothel owners, or she was killed by the police.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; At the time, there were no reports of clients committing crimes against prostitutes. Sources in the police department reported that the police were seriously looking into the possibility that she had been killed by someone hired by the brothel owners. Her first encounter with AMMAR occurred when she complained to the media about being assaulted by pimps and bouncers,&lt;ref name="luchadora"/&gt; i.e. by men associated with a bar that was a front for a brothel. The two chiefs of the Public Morality unit who were removed after her complaint were being paid by brothel owners to drive off street sex workers.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; Her struggle against the brothel owners went back many years.

Everyone else assumed it was the police. The police in [[Argentina]] have a history of killing reformers and killing sex workers. A few years earlier, investigators in [[Mar del Plata]] had uncovered a police conspiracy to use a fictional serial killer to cover up the murder of thirty two sex workers,

The [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]] police killed the social activist [[Pocho Lepratti | Claudio Lepratti]] during the disturbances of 2001 when he tried to warn them off from firing at a school where children were eating lunch. At Cabrera's funeral procession, the AMMAR members shouted "We know, we know, that our colleague was killed by the police."&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

Among political insiders and unionists there were two theories about the police. The first was that they killed Cabrera to silence her. The second was that they killed her to warn the new provincial government in [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]] to stop interfering with the graft. Changes of administrations in [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]] had typically been accompanied by some sort of organized criminal action by the police, just to remind everybody of the rules of the game.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; Carlos del Frade relates that during [[Jorge Obeid | Obeid]]'s first administration as governor of [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]], he removed a half dozen police officers who had been involved in state sponsored torture and terrorism. The police responded with a message that if he removed any more police officers, it would break the institutional peace in the province.&lt;ref name="matar"/&gt;

The previous administration had responded to Cabrera's complaints by removing high ranking officers for corruption, and the new administration was arresting street level officers for extortion. This second theory implies that Cabrera's killers just wanted to warn off the government from the dangerous experiment of punishing police officers for corruption.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

To show its resolve in moving the case forward, the provincial government quickly appointed a committee of five police officers to investigate. The committee was under the direct orders of José Manuel Maldonado, head of Regional Unit II of the provincial police; in effect, chief of police for the city of [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]]. Previously, as head of the Judicial Police, he had been accused of shielding officers involved with the killing of [[Pocho Lepratti | Claudio Lepratti]] and protecting 1st Precinct policemen accused of raping a sixteen year old girl. According to the assistant secretary of the [[Argentine Workers' Central Union | CTA]] (the union federation AMMAR belongs to), Maldonado ensured that proceeds from the payments extorted from sex workers and the money that pimps paid for protection were distributed to officers and politicians appropriately. The unit he currently headed had been linked three years previously to extra-judicial executions and deaths in custody. So he was head of a police unit accused of exactly the type of assassination people were accusing the police of in the Cabrera case, he was believed to be responsible for administering the graft that she had been campaigning against, and he appeared to be experienced in covering up police crimes. The [[Argentine Workers' Central Union | CTA]] and the [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] association of prosecutors demanded his removal.&lt;ref name="zorro"/&gt;

After several months of investigation, the investigating judge ordered the detention of Parvlucyk, the Federal police officer Cabrera had been involved with, and charged him with murder.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; In addition to their troubled relationship, Parvlucyk had stated in his testimony that his immediate superior had asked him to silence Cabrera, and his superior has stated that Parvlucyk always complied with orders.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On appeal, the judge's decision was overturned, and neither Parvlucyk nor anyone else has been tried for Cabrera's murder.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; The panel of judges that overturned the decision of the investigating judge referred to some of the witnesses as ""people with street activities who pass their mornings with a wandering itinerary".&lt;ref name="miedo"/&gt; One of the appeals judges discredited the testimony of over twenty street-based sex workers because they were women who "have an activity that can not be described as good morals," according to the journalist Carlos Del Frade.&lt;ref name="estructural"/&gt; He claims that the possibility that Parvlucyk killed Cabrera because he was ordered to silence her was never properly investigated. Del Frade also claims that the link between Cabrera's murder and the structural corruption in the provincial and Federal police organizations was never investigated.&lt;ref name="estructural"/&gt;

Among the members of AMMAR's [[Rosario, Argentina | Rosario]] chapter, the reaction to Cabrera's murder was a mixture of fear and bravado. "If AMMAR dies, we fatten the pigs," they told each other, and "She paid for everything, and that's why the fight continues."&lt;ref name="explotadores"/&gt; But when Cabrera's friend Claudia Lucero took over as general secretary of the chapter, she found it sometimes difficult to reach out to her colleagues. They warned her, "Don't get involved, you'll end up like Sandra."&lt;ref name="miedo"/&gt; A lawyer who worked for [[Argentine Workers' Central Union | CTA]], the trade union federation that AMMAR is part of, and who represented AMMAR during the murder investigation, said that some of the women who might have testified refused to get involved in the case, and others left [[Santa Fe province]] out of fear.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt; Four years later, Lucero reported similar fear among the street workers.

{{ quote
| text= Fear is present. When I tell you, let's get together, come, they're afraid. I can not tell them we are going to a march or when we are going to do some research work as well. To myself they say "How do you keep going"?&lt;ref name="estructural"/&gt;
| author= Claudia Lucero}}

As for Macarena Cabrera, Sandra's daughter, one can only imagine her reaction to it all. Growing up she had access to the Internet and knew about the failure of the murder investigation and the various theories people proposed. Nine years after the murder she went to the [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] branch of the Government Workers Association, the union that had provided AMMAR Rosario with office space and where her mother had been well known, and told them she really wanted to know what happened to her mother. They were probably able to give her a lot of information, but the source for this says that actual explanations were in short supply.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
=== Influence ===
==== Public Morality police unit ====
If the police were, in fact, trying to send a message to the new provincial administration, it backfired. Cabrera's murder gave the government the political cover it needed to eliminate the Public Morality section of the provincial police. High on the list of her legacies is the fact that two days after her murder, the Santa Fe Minister of Government announced that the Public Morality section would be dissolved and the officers that served in it would be distributed among different units. He said that the move had been under consideration since the beginning of the new administration:

{{ quote
| text= ... because it is an obsolete unit that allows a certain degree of corruption, without passing judgment on the officers that served in it.
| author= Alberto Gianneschi, Minister of Government in Santa Fe province at the time of Sandra Cabrera's murder

But he acknowledged that he was making the announcement in the context of Cabrera's murder.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Misdemeanor Code ====
On the other hand, the government wanted to amend, rather than repeal, the articles of the Misdemeanor Code that criminalized sex work and transgenderism. The political opposition favored straight repeal, but the government was concerned about voter reaction and opposition from the Church.&lt;ref name="explotadores"/&gt; As the Minister of Government put it with Victorian sensibility:

{{ quote
| text= We are looking for a balance between the claims of the defense of modesty and scandalous prostitution through a new bill.
| author= Alberto Gianneschi&lt;ref name="noticia"/&gt;
}}

As the new secretary general of AMMAR's [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] chapter, Claudia Lucero continued the campaign to repeal the articles.

{{ quote
| text= "The contravention codes are not repealed. The situation is the same, the only thing that changed is that there is no more Public Morality, but there are the precincts, there is the command [police unit], the police are still chasing us. After Sandra's death, a month later, we had a partner in Baigorria who was threatened and beaten. The harassment continues, the mobile units stop us, some police come and say 'you have to go because the neighbor says' and that is a lie. They make it up so that the sex worker gives them money and they let her work. The commands are in the red zone and that's because the codes are not repealed and the police still have power.&lt;ref name="estructural"/&gt;
| author= Claudia Lucero }}

For AMMAR [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], the campaign was an important rallying point. The constant police harassment intimidated the women in the street, but it also gave them strong motivation to take steps, however risky, to join the campaign against laws that legitimized the harassment. And since the campaign had been Cabrera's initiative, it gave the union frequent opportunity to invoke the name of Sandra Cabrera, who had become an important symbol for sex workers' rights.

{{ quote
| text= I said when Sandra passed, let's try to continue because otherwise everything is dying. And that is the commitment and at the same time persuades me that the death of Sandra was not in vain, beyond that we do not have justice. But it was not in vain, because we followed the path she left us. The day that the codes are repealed will not be our achievement, that's the way Sandra prepared us, so the achievement will be hers.&lt;ref name="estructural"/&gt;
| author= Claudia Lucero }}

Finally, in 2010, after years of lobbying and activism by AMMAR [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], a different administration repealed the articles of the law that Cabrera had campaigned against.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
While she didn't live to see the victory, she was part of the fight, and it was a more fundamental restructuring of society's relationship with sex work than eliminating a police unit.

==== Rosario ====
Walter Miranda, who had been removed as chief of the Public Morality unit following Cabrera's complaint because he had been providing protection to brothels that trafficked underage girls and foreign women, as well as extorting bribes from street-based sex workers, continued to advance through the ranks. By 2012 he had become head of Regional Unit II, which gave him control of all provincial police forces in the city of [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]]. The brothels in the area around the bus terminal that he had been protecting were still there. During an investigation of trafficking in humans, a phone tap of one of the brothel owners recorded the owner asking how to go about selling cocaine. The answer was that he should bribe Hugo Tognoli, the highest ranking police officer in the province of [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]]. Laura Cosido, a judge in the Federal Chamber of Rosario, stated that "There was never such an open relationship between narcos and police." AMMAR, Cabrera's union, complained that the drug and human trafficking networks were the same.

Around the same time, Claudia Lucero was complaining that in spite of the revocation of the articles of the Misdemeanor Code that criminalized street prostitution, the police were still finding ways to extort money from street workers.

Shortly thereafter, sex work in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] went through the same change in law and enforcement that the rest of Argentina experienced. The anti-trafficking law, passed a few years earlier, began to be enforced consistently, ending the legal regulation of brothels by municipalities. One of the last cabarets in Rosario was closed when city inspectors found an entertainer performing oral sex on a customer. Announcing that they were closing the place, the inspectors were attacked by the madame and the female employees, who threw glasses and punched and kicked the inspectors. Driven into the street, they took refuge in a local bar where the women found them and again attacked, throwing and breaking tables and stealing the tape used to officially seal a closed business. Not everyone in Argentina embraced the new anti-trafficking regime.

Some of the women who had worked in the cabarets and ''whiskerías'' that fronted for brothels moved to private apartments operated by the same type of people who had operated the brothels.

The motels that once rented to independent sex workers now turn them away in order to avoid problems with the city. In response, some of the women have organized ''casitas'', where a group of women rent a house and set aside a part of the earnings from each client session to cover the rent. Basically, women who were previously working in brothels are still working in brothels, and women who were previously independent are still independent. Georgina Orellano, secretary general of AMMAR as of 2017, says of the new legal regime that "It took all the activity to a much darker and hidden place."&lt;ref name="sombra"/&gt;

For the street based workers, Orellano says that since Mauricio Macri became Argentina's president, institutional violence has increased in public spaces.

{{ quote
| text=  We suffer more searches, more humiliation, more payment of fines and the difficulty of making use of the street. Lately, there are reports that the police drive the girls away, beat them, do not let them work, ask them for sexual favors and ask for money.&lt;ref name="sombra"/&gt;
| author= Georgina Orellano
}}

Orellano says that the new prohibitionist regime recognizes only victims and pimps, and criminalizes women who enter sex work voluntarily. The current municipal law on sex work in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], passed in 2013, mentions assistance and support; Orellano says that the city department responsible for implementing the assistance has helped so few women that they can be counted on the fingers of the two hands. AMMAR's last survey found one hundred women working the streets in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], and it is estimated that another six hundred are working indoors.&lt;ref name="sombra"/&gt;

The legal and police system that Sandra Cabrera struggled with has changed. Where it once tolerated brothels it has become prohibitionist. The laws that once referred to street based sex work as "scandalous" and an "offense to modesty"&lt;ref name="proyecto"/&gt; now speak of assisting sex workers. The owners of regulated brothels who once assaulted independent sex workers in the streets, or paid the police to do the same, now operate illegally in private apartments, driven underground by the prohibitionist movement that currently opposes AMMAR in the media and the legislatures. The political projects of Cabrera and AMMAR's founders have been challenged by new social forces with different concepts of sex worker rights and agency. And yet street based sex workers face the same problems, including police violence and extortion. Perhaps Cabrera's most important legacy is illustrated by a little story told by Claudia Lucero a year after Cabrera's death:

{{ quote
| text= A short while ago the Command [Radio Command, a police unit] wanted to take bribes from a member [of AMMAR], and it turns out that she is unionized. She told them to take her prisoner, but she would call her lawyer as soon as she got to the police station because she had that right. The cops wanted to arrange something, give them money, or go to jail. But when she told them that, they dropped her at a corner and left.&lt;ref name="frente"/&gt;

=== Recognition ===
Nine days after Cabrera's murder, marches were held in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], [[Buenos Aires]], and [[Salta province]], demanding justice and sex workers rights. The counts of participants weren't given for the marches, but the [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] march was described as "multitudinous" and included a cross section of [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] civic society, including leaders of political parties, unions, and human rights groups.

The '''''shi''''' ({{zh|c=尸|p=''shī''|w=''sh'ih''|l=corpse}}) was a ceremonial "personator" who represented a dead relative during ancient [[Ancestor Veneration in China|Chinese ancestral sacrifices]]. In a ''shi'' ceremony, the ancestral spirit supposedly would enter the descendant "corpse" personator, who would eat and drink sacrificial offerings and convey messages from the spirit. [[James Legge]] (1895 IV:135), an early translator of the Chinese classics, described ''shi'' personation ceremonies as "grand family reunions where the dead and the living met, eating and drinking together, where the living worshipped the dead, and the dead blessed the living." In modern terms, this ancient Chinese ''shi'' practice would be described as [[necromancy]], [[mediumship]], or [[spirit possession]].

==Word==
[[File:尸-oracle.svg|thumb|150px|[[Oracle bone script]] for ''shi'' 尸]]
[[File:尸-bronze.svg|thumb|150px|[[Bronze script]] for ''shi'' 尸]]
[[File:尸-seal.svg|thumb|150px|[[Seal script]] for ''shi'' 尸]]

The word ''shi'' 尸 "corpse; personator; inactive; lay out; manage; spirit tablet" can be discussed in terms of [[Chinese character]] evolution, [[Historical Chinese phonology|historical phonology]], [[semantics]], and English translations.

===Characters===
The modern character [[Wikt:尸|尸]] for ''shi'' "corpse; personator" is a graphic simplification of ancient [[pictograph]]s showing a person with a bent back and dangling legs. The first records of ''shi'' are on [[oracle bones]] dating from the late [[Shang Dynasty]] (ca. 1600–ca. 1046 BCE). The [[oracle bone script]] for ''shi'' 尸 "corpse" was used interchangeably for ''yi'' [[Wikt:夷|夷]] "barbarian; non-Chinese people (esp. eastern, see ''[[Dongyi]]''); at ease; level". The [[bronze script]] for ''shi'' 尸, found in [[Chinese bronze inscriptions]] dating from the Shang and [[Zhou Dynasty]] (ca. 1045 BCE-ca. 256 BCE), had a more curved back and legs. The graphically reduced [[seal script]] for ''shi'', standardized during the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221-207 BCE), resembles the [[regular script]] 尸.

Today, ''shi'' 尸 is more commonly used as the [[Radical 44|"corpse/body radical"]] in [[Chinese characters]] (number 44 in the [[List of Kangxi radicals]]) than to write the original word "corpse". Many characters written with this radical involve the body (e.g., ''niao'' [[Wikt:尿|尿]] "urine" with 水 "water"), but not all (e.g., ''wu'' [[Wikt:屋|屋]] "house; room" with 至 "go to"). 

''Shi'' 尸 "corpse; cadaver" has a [[variant Chinese character]] [[Wikt:屍|屍]] that combines the "corpse radical" 尸 with ''si'' [[Wikt:死|死]] "dead" (e.g., ''[[jiang shi]]'' 僵屍 "stiff corpse") Michael Carr (2007:358) explains, "This semantically redundant ''shi'' 屍 'dead-corpse' graphically distinguishes the original 'corpse' meaning of ''shi'' 尸from its various other meanings such as 'personator'."

===Meanings===
[[Chinese classics]] used the word ''shi'' 尸 in six meanings: 
*(1) "corpse; body of a dead person"
*(2) "personator of a dead ancestor"
*(3) "motionless; inactive"
*(4) "lay out; arrange; expose"
*(5) "manage; direct; spirit tablet"
*(6) "proper names (of a place, family, and bird)"
Carr (2007:362) outlines the semantic connections among these ''shi'' meanings. The basic meaning (1) "corpse" was semantically extended into both (2) "act on behalf of a corpse" or "personator of a dead ancestor" and (3) "act like a corpse" or "motionless; inactive; doing nothing". Meaning (4) "lay out, arrange; display" generalizes "lay out a corpse." Meaning (5) "manage; direct; ancestral tablet" links the representative ''shi'' (2) "personator" with the metaphorical replacement "ancestral tablet". Meaning (6) uses ''shi'' to transcribe proper names.

Meaning (1) is the core sense of "corpse; dead body; cadaver; carcass". Early ritual texts, notably the ''[[Liji]]'' "Classic of Rites", ''[[Zhouli]]'' "Rites of Zhou", and ''[[Etiquette and Rites|Yili]]'' "Etiquette and Rites", frequently use ''shi'' "corpse" in [[mortuary]] and [[funeral]] contexts. Here is an example ''Liji'' passage:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As soon as death took place, the corpse was transferred to the couch, and covered with a large sheet. The clothes in which the deceased had died were removed. A servant plugged the mouth open with the spoon of horn; and to keep the feet from contracting, an easy stool was employed. These observances were the same for a ruler, a great officer, and an ordinary officer. (22, tr. Legge 1885 28:181)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Shi'' meaning (2) "personator; sacrificial representative of a dead person's spirit" is discussed below.

Meaning (3) figuratively expands ''shi'' to "corpse-like", which can contextually mean either "motionless; calm; quiescent" or "inactive; negligent; remiss". A ''Shijing'' ode (245, tr. Karlgren 1950:214) laments that, "the good men sit motionless and silent". Karlgren explains, "'The good men act the corpse,' play the part of a representative of the dead at a sacrifice, who sits still and silent during the whole ceremony; here then, remain inactive, do nothing to help." The ''[[Lunyu]]'' ("Confucian Analects") uses ''shi'' to praise [[Confucius]] (tr. Legge 1895 I:235), "In bed, he did not lie like a corpse." Commentators disagree whether this means "sleep with the arms and legs sprawled out" or "sleep facing the north (the land of the dead)".

Meaning (4) is defined as Chinese ''chen'' [[Wikt:陳|陳]] "lay out; set forth, array; arrange; display". Examples in classic texts range from specifically "lay out (a corpse)" to generally "lay out; set out; arrange". The ''Liji'' distinguishes between ''shi'' 尸 "uncoffined corpse" and ''jiu'' [[Wikt:柩|柩]] (with the "wood radical" and a ''jiu'' 匛 "long; enduring" phonetic) "coffined corpse" (tr. Legge 1885 27:117): "(The corpse) on the couch is called [''shi''] (the laid out); when it is put into the coffin, that is called [''jiu''] (being in the long home)." A ''[[Shijing]]'' poem (185, tr. Karlgren 1950) refers to men called off to war, "There are mothers who set forth the (sacrificial) dishes."

Meaning (5) of ''shi'' is defined as ''zhu'' [[Wikt:主|主]] "master; manage, preside; spirit tablet, ancestral tablet". The ''[[Chuci]]'' (tr. Hawkes 1959:55) uses ''shi'' asking about [[King Wu of Zhou]], whose father [[King Wen of Zhou]] did not live to see the conquering of the previous dynasty, Shang-Yin: "When Wu set out to kill Yin, why was he so grieved? He went into the battle carrying the 'corpse.' Why was he in such haste?" Commentators disagree whether this ''shi'' means ''zhu'', specifically ''muzhu'' 木主 "wooden spirit/ancestral tablet" or ''jiu'' "corpse in a coffin". Hawkes justifies translating "corpse": "According to some accounts it was the 'spirit tablet' of his dead father [King Wen] which King Wu carried in his chariot to battle. But I think the poet understood him to have taken the actual corpse, and was surprised that he had not waited to bury it."

The sinologists Eduard Erkes and Bernhard Karlgren debated this ''Chuci'' usage of ''shi'' "corpse; spirit tablet". Erkes (1928) proposed that the ''zhu'' was a wooden ancestral tablet shaped in the image of the deceased. Karlgren (1930) disagreed and argued that the ''zhu'' was phallic shaped:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He seems to think that the substitution of [muzhu] 'wooden tablet' for the corpse (if really a corpse is intended; the word shi is ambiguous) proves the [muzhu] to have been an image of the corpse, and therefore he translates [muzhu] by 'wooden statue.' Nothing could be more arbitrary. The [muzhu], wooden ancestral tablet, was the resting place of the ancestor's spirit, once his body was dead and decomposed. In this sense it was a substitute for his body, his spiritual force had entered it, and therefore it was carried into battle, bringing this mental force of his into play on the side of his descendant. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Erkes (1931) countered Karlgren by citing other texts describing a human-shaped ''muzhu'' "wooden lord". For instance, the ''[[Shiji]]'' ("Record of History", tr. Erkes) records this King Wu story with ''muzhu'' instead of ''shi'': "He (viz. Wu-Wang) made a wooden image of Wen-Wang and took it with [him] on his carriage into the battle." Erkes further suggested, "very probably the custom of carrying a [muzhu] into battle had developed from an earlier one of taking the body itself, and that therefore the [muzhu] was something representing the corpse, i.e., an image of the deceased."

Meaning (6) includes some semantically unrelated usages of ''shi''. ''Shi'' 尸 is an ancient place name (in [[Henan]]); a surname (e.g., the [[Syncretism (Chinese philosophy)|Syncretist]] philosopher [[Shizi (book)|Shizi]] 尸子, ca. 390–330 BCE); and a variant of ''shi'' [[Wikt:鳲|鳲]] (which is used in bird names like ''shijiu'' 鳲鳩 "cuckoo; turtledove").

===Pronunciations and etymologies===
The [[Standard Chinese]] ''shī'' pronunciation of 尸 phonologically descends from (ca. 6th century CE) [[Middle Chinese]] and (ca. 6th century BCE) [[Old Chinese]]. Compare these Middle and Old Chinese reconstructions of ''shi'' 尸 "corpse" and ''yi'' 夷 "barbarian" (which anciently had interchangeable characters): ''śi'' &lt; *''śjər'' 尸and ''i'' &lt; *''djər'' 夷 ([[Bernhard Karlgren]] 1957), ''syij'' &lt; *''hljij'' 尸and ''yij'' &lt; *''ljɨj'' 夷 (William Baxter 1992), and ''śi'' &lt; *''lhi'' 尸 and ''ji'' &lt; *''ləi'' 夷 (Axel Schuessler 2009).

There are several hypothetical [[etymologies]] for ''shi'' "corpse". Karlgren proposed that ''si'' &lt; *''sjər'' 死 "die, dead" and ''shi'' &lt; *''śjər'' 尸 "the dead, corpse" were etymologically [[cognate]]. Paul K. Benedict (1972) suggested possible [[Proto-Sino-Tibetan]] roots for ''shi'': either *''(s-)raw'' "corpse; carcass" or *''siy'' "die". Schuessler (2007) hypothesizes a semantic development from *''li'' 夷 "extend; expose; display; set out; spread out" to *''lhi'' 尸 "to spread out; lie down flat (in order to sleep); motionless; to set forth (sacrificial dishes)", to "personator of a dead ancestor", to "corpse". He rejects Karlgren's assumption that ''shi'' "corpse" is cognate to ''si'' "to die", "because the MC [Middle Chinese] initial ''ś-'' (&lt; *''lh-'', *''nh-'', *''hj-'') never derives from an *''s-'', except when they share an initial *''l'' or *''n''."

===Translations===
English translations of the ceremonial ''shi'' 尸 include ''[[personator]]'', ''[[impersonator]]'', ''[[:wikt:representative|representative]]'', ''[[Mediumship|medium]]'', and ''[[shaman]]''. Carr reviews the choices.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Obviously, rendering this into English is problematic because there is no Western analogy for the ceremonial ''shi'' 'corpse.' ''Personator'' is chosen as the nearest English translation. ''Impersonator'' would be possible, but this word implies falsehood, which was not originally associated with the ''shi''. ''Representative'' is too general in meaning, and does not usually have a sense of spirituality, unless modified by ''of the dead/ancestor''. Paper [1995] suggests ''Incorporator of the Dead'', which has a parallel 'one who embodies' etymology, but the derivate words ''incorporate'' and ''incorporation'' commonly have other meanings. ''Medium'' and ''shaman'' are similar with ''shi'' in meaning and are part of Chinese traditions; however, the descriptions of a dignified personator are unlike the spirit-possession of either. Another translational tactic would be to coin a [[nonce word]], such as Waley's [1937] "the Dead One," Eberhard's [1968] "death boy," or Wilhelm's [1967] "corpse boy," but the sense of such a coinage is not always clear. Therefore, in the absence of a better English word, ''personator'' will translate this meaning of ''shi''. (2007:364-365) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early descriptions==
Zhou Dynasty classic texts (c. 11th-3rd centuries BCE) use the word ''shi'' 尸 hundreds of times. Lothar von Falkenhausen contrasts the frequently recorded ''shi'' "personator" with the rarely noted [[Wu (shaman)|''wu'']] [[Wikt:巫|巫]] "shaman; spirit medium". 
&lt;blockquote&gt;At ancestral sacrifices, the ancestral spirits descend into individuals designated from among their descendants, the "Impersonators" (''shi'' 尸). Occupying their ritual rôle by virtue of their kinship position vis-à-vis the ancestor that is sacrificed to, the Impersonators are not trained religious specialists like the Spirit Mediums. Although it has been speculated that the actions of the ''shi'' may have originally involved trance and possession, the surviving source materials — none earlier than the Western Zhou period — show them as staid and passive, acting with the utmost demeanor and dignity. (1995) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some early ''shi'' meanings are contextually ambiguous. For instance, the ''[[Yijing]]'' ("Book of Changes") uses ''yu shi'' [[Wikt:輿|輿]]尸 "carry corpses; corpse carrier" twice for [[I Ching hexagrams#Hexagram 7|Hexagram 7]] (tr. Wilhelm 1967:34-35): "Perchance the army carries corpses in the wagon. Misfortune … Let the eldest lead the army. The younger transports corpses. Then perseverance brings misfortune." [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]] summarizes the ''Yijing'' commentaries.
&lt;blockquote&gt; Here we have a choice of two explanations. One points to defeat because someone other than the chosen leader interferes with the command; the other is similar in its general meaning, but the expression, "carries corpses in the wagon," is interpreted differently. At burials and at sacrifices to the dead it was customary in China for the deceased to whom the sacrifice was made to be represented by a boy of the family, who sat in the dead man's place and was honored as his representative. On the basis of this custom the text is interpreted as meaning that a "corpse boy" is sitting in the wagon, or, in other words, that authority is not being exercised by the proper leaders but has been usurped by others. (1967:34) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Marshall (2002:77) concludes this hexagram refers to carrying a corpse, and compares the "Israelites carrying the Ark of the Covenant into battle against the Philistines".

===Shijing===
The ''[[Shijing]]'' ("Classic of Poetry", ca. 11th-6th centuries BCE) contains early and detailed descriptions of personation ceremonies, in the following themes.
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is an abundance of sacrificial wine and food (odes 166, 209, 210, and 248) shared by both the ancestral spirits (through the personator) and their descendants. Drunkenness is frequently mentioned: 209/5 "The spirits [note: 'souls' not 'liquor'] are all drunk," 209/6 "all are happy; they are drunk," 247/1, 2 "We are drunk with wine," and 248/5 "the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and is befumed (by the spirits); the good wine makes you merry." Most significantly, the ancestral spirits speak directly through the intoxicated personators (166, 210, and 247), approve of the sacrificial offerings, and bless their descendants (166, 209, 210, 247, and 248). (Carr 2007:369) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Shi'' "personator" occurs fourteen times in two pairs of consecutive ''Shijing'' odes (209–210 and 247–248, tr. Karlgren 1950:203-204). Ode 209 says "we make (the representative of the dead) sit at ease, we (assist him =) encourage him to eat" and "The august representative of the dead then rises, the drums and bells (by their sound) escort away the representative." The following ode 210 describes sacrificial wine and food, "he presents them  to our representative of the dead and to our guests."

''Shijing'' odes 247 and 248, which portray ancestral feasts to the Zhou royal house, exclusively use the term ''gongshi'' 公尸 with the modifier ''gong'' [[Wikt:公|公]] "prince; duke; public; palace; effort". Compare these ''gongshi'' translations: "representative of the (dead) princes" (Karlgren), "personators of your ancestors" (Legge, admitting 1895 IV:447, "The expression 公尸, 'ducal personators,' is somewhat difficult to account for"), "impersonator of the Ancient", "ducal Dead", or "Dead One" (Waley, noting 1937:215, "Impersonator of a former Duke or ruler"). Ode 247 (''Jizui'' 既醉 "Already Drunk") describes a sacrificial feast for ancestral spirits, and says "the representative of the (dead) princes makes a happy announcement".

Ode 248 (''Fuyi'' 鳧鷖 "Wild Ducks") describes another feast, which commentators say was held on the following day to reward the personator, and details sacrificial offerings and ancestral blessings.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The wild ducks are on the [Jing] (river); the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and is at peace; your wine is clear, your viands are fragrant; the representative feasts and drinks; felicity and blessings come and (achieve, complete you =) make you perfect. &lt;br&gt;
The wild ducks are on the sands; the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and (approves =) finds it good; your wine is plentiful, your viands are fine; the representative feasts and drinks; felicity and blessings come and (act for =) favor you. &lt;br&gt;
The wild ducks are on the island; the representative of the (dead) prices comes and feasts and reposes; your wine is strained, your viands are sliced; the representative feasts and drinks; felicity and blessings come and descend on you. &lt;br&gt;
The wild ducks are at the junction of the river; the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and is (treated in temple-fashion =) revered; the feast is in the temple, that is where felicity and blessings descend; the representative feasts and drinks; felicity and blessings come and are piled up (heavily =) amply on you. &lt;br&gt;
The wild ducks are in the gorge; the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and is befumed (by the spirits); the good wine makes you merry; the roast and broiled things are fragrant; the representative feasts and drinks; there will be no after trouble. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Besides the ''Shijing'', other texts refer to ''shi'' frequently drinking sacrificial [[Chinese alcoholic beverages|''jiu'']] 酒 "alcoholic beverage; liquor", which Paper (1995:113) interprets as a ritual means to induce hallucinations of ancestral spirits. Based upon a ''Liji'' ceremony (tr. Legge 1885 28:246) describing a ''shi'' personator drinking nine cups of ''jiu'', with an estimated alcohol content from 5% to 8%, and volume measurements of Zhou bronze sacrificial cups, Paper (1995:114) calculates a "conservative estimate is that the ''shi'' consumed between 2.4 and 3.9 ounces of pure alcohol (equivalent to between 5 and 8 bar shots of eighty-proof liquor)."

===Child personators===
Several texts refer to a Chinese custom that a personator should be a child of the same sex as the dead ancestor, preferably either a legitimate grandson or his wife. However, personation by younger relatives, who were of lower [[social status]] than their elders, created an exception to traditional Chinese culture. The earliest textual reference comes from the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mengzi]]'' ("Book of Mencius") questioning the status shown to a younger brother during the personation ceremony.
&lt;blockquote&gt;You should ask him, "Which do you respect most, — your uncle, or your younger brother?" He will answer, "My uncle." Ask him again, "If your younger brother be personating a dead ancestor, to which do you show the greater respect, — to him or to your uncle?" He will say, "To my younger brother." You can go on, "But where is the respect due, as you said, to your uncle?" He will reply to this, "I show the respect to my younger brother because of the position which he occupies." (6, tr. Legge 1895 IV:400). &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Liji'' reiterates that personation contradicted the established social hierarchy (18, tr. Legge 1895 28:88): "Thus it is that there are two among his subjects whom the ruler does not treat as subjects. When one is personating (his ancestor) he does not treat him as such, nor does he treat his master as such." Another ''Liji'' passage (7, tr. Legge 1895 27:337-338) explains: "A rule of propriety says, 'A superior man may carry his grandson in his arms, but not his son.' This tells us that a grandson may be the personator of his deceased grandfather (at sacrifices), but a son cannot be so of his father." When a grandson personated his grandfather's spirit, it reversed the normal family hierarchy and a father would have to worship his own son. 

Scholars have differing hypotheses explaining why a grandchild would make the most suitable personator. [[Marcel Granet]] (1930:337–338) said the basic reason was a predominance of uterine over agnatic [[primogeniture]]; the grandfather is the closest of the uterine relatives, and thus closer to his grandson than the father is. [[Wolfram Eberhard]] (1968:338) explained that a child makes the best personator owing to the ancient Chinese believed that a soul is small. [[Julian Jaynes]] (1976:344–345) mentions a Greek parallel; the philosopher [[Iamblichus]] wrote that "young and simple persons" make the most suitable mediums. Stephen Bokenkamp mentions examples besides ''shi'' rituals.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In China, possessions by spirits that occurred outside of this ritual scenario often involved younger members of the family as well. As in instances of mediumism around the world, the youthful and illiterate were regarded as more reliable conduits to the dead, since they could hardly be suspected of having fabricated their utterances and writings themselves. This fact brings to the fore questions of power. Women and junior male members of a family frequently found that mediumism was a way to bring attention to their own, otherwise easily ignored, concerns. (2007:40) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Female personators===
Two ritual texts mention female personators. The ''Liji'' (15, tr. Legge 1885 28:75) describes a wife personating her husband's dead grandmother: "A wife, on festive occasions, even though it were on receiving a gift from the ruler, (only) made a curtsy. When seated as a personatrix (of the deceased grandmother of her husband), she did not bow with her head to her hands, but made the curtsy." The ''Yili'' (14, tr. Steele 1917:119.) euphemistically says a female personator should preferably not be the wife of a concubine's grandson; "A man personates a dead man, and a woman a woman. In the latter case a woman of a different surname is chosen, and as such not one of inferior standing."

===Historical changes in personation===
Several early texts and commentaries reiterate a traditional history of personation beginning in the second millennium BCE as a sacred communion with ancestral spirits, but ending as a drinking party in the late 1st millennium BCE. When the personation ceremony supposedly originated during the [[Xia Dynasty]] (ca. 2100-ca. 1600 BCE), a personator would make contact with the dead ancestral spirit before sitting down to eat and drink. During the Yin or Shang Dynasty (ca. 1600-1046 BCE), a personator would sometimes sit down without having contacted the spirit, and by the late Zhou Dynasty (1045-256 BCE), a personation ceremony became a revelry with several personators repeatedly making toasts and drinking sacrificial wines.

Two ''Liji'' chapters describe how personation rituals changed during the Zhou period.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Under the [Zhou] dynasty the representatives of the dead sat. Their monitors and cup-suppliers observed no regular rules. The usages were the same (as those of Yin [Shang]), and the underlying principle was one. Under the [Xia] dynasty, the personators had stood till the sacrifice was ended (whereas) under the Yin [Shang] they sat. Under [Zhou], when the cup went round among all, there were six personators. [Zengzi] said, "The usages of [Zhou] might be compared to a subscription club." (10, tr. Legge 1885 27:405-406) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(When the representative of the departed) had made the libation with the [jia] cup, or the horn, (the sacrificer) was told (to bow to him) to put him at ease. Anciently, the representative stood when nothing was being done; when anything was being done, he sat. He personated the spirit. The officer of prayer was the medium of communication between him and the sacrificer. (11, tr. Legge 1885 27:446) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Later sources repeat this legendary history of personation. For example, He Xiu 何休's 2nd-century commentary to the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals|Chunqiu]]'' ("Spring and Autumn Annals") ''[[Gongyang Zhuan]]'' says (tr. Carr 2007:371), "The Xia had standing personators, the Shang [Yin] had sitting personators, and the Zhou had six personators who would make serial toasts." Granet (1930:337) mentions the Zhou personation parties: "It was not long before this archaic custom was criticized by the ritualists. When the sacrifices were offered simultaneously to several ancestors each of whom was represented, the ceremony was found indeed to assume a displeasing likeness to a picnic."

===Doubts about personation===
The above ''Liji'' description of Zhou "subscription club" personation ceremonies quotes [[Confucius]]'s student and compiler [[Zengzi]] (505-436 BCE). The ''Liji'' contains three passages where Zengzi questions his teacher about whether personators were needed for ancestral rituals. For instance:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Zengzi] asked, "Is it necessary that there should be a representative of the dead in sacrifices? Or may he be dispensed with as when the satisfying offerings are made to the dead?" Confucius said, "In sacrificing to a full-grown man for whom there have been the funeral rites, there must be such a representative, who should be a grandson; and if the grandson is too young, someone must be employed to carry him in his arms. If there be no grandson, some one of the same surname should be selected for the occasion. In sacrificing to the one who had died prematurely, there are (only) the satisfying offerings, for he was not full-grown. To sacrifice to a full-grown man, for whom there have been the funeral rites without a representative, would be to treat him as if he had died prematurely." (7, tr. Legge 1885 27:337-338) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Hypothetical origins ==
Chinese scholars have long disagreed about when and how ''shi'' personation originated. Henri Doré (1914 1:99-102) summarizes the four principal opinions, which are worth quoting in full.

The first opinion is that personation was a bygone superstition. The [[Tang Dynasty]] historian [[Du You]] criticizes the ''shi'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ancients employed a personator. This rite deserves censure, and has been abolished by our great Worthies. One vied with the other in practicing it. Now that an era of progress has set in, and these silly customs have disappeared, it is important not to revive them; common sense bids to refrain from them. Some half-baked literati of our days would fain re-establish this ceremony of the personator. This is quite absurd. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second opinion is that the personator was not the agent of the departed, but merely its metaphorical representative or ''shenxiang'' 神象 "image of the spirit". The [[Han Dynasty]] historian [[Ban Gu]] explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The personator is found in the ceremony wherein sacrifice is offered to ancestors, because the soul emitting no perceptible sounds and having no visible form, the loving sentiment of filial piety finds no means of displaying itself, hence a personator has been chosen to whom meats are offered, after which he breaks the bowls, quite rejoiced, as if his own father had eaten plenty. The personator, drinking abundantly, imparts the illusion that it is the soul which is satiated. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Carr (2007:386) notes, "This passage sounds as though Ban had personally observed a personation ceremony."    
   
Some [[Qing Dynasty]] scholars held a third opinion, namely, that the personator was bearer of the ancestral tablet. The ''Jishuo quanzhen'' 集說詮真 "Collected Sayings Explaining Truth" says, "The filial son chooses a personator to carry the tablet, but not to be the resting place of the soul of the dead person. His intention is therefore manifest." The ''Yuzhou dayiyi'' 宇宙大疑議 "Discussion of Universal Great Doubts" says: "The personator is employed during sacrifices to the dead, in order to carry the ancestral tablet … hence there is no need of having such a one immediately after death, as the tablet is not yet erected."

The fourth opinion refutes the first three condemnations of personators as mere representatives or tablet-holders for the dead, and contends that a personator was temporarily the seat of a dead ancestor's soul. Two leading [[Neo-Confucianist]] philosophers held this judgment.
[[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] writes: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ancients, when sacrificing to the dead, employed the personator, because the soul and the vital force of the dead person after being separated from the body, seek an agent of the same nature. Now, men being all of the same kind, the father and the children being all of one family and of the same stock, the soul of the departed person is requested to come and establish its seat in one of them as in an agent. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
His follower [[Zhu Xi]] concurs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In ancient times all employed a personator when sacrificing to the dead. Since the descendants continue the life of their ancestors, the personator shares, therefore, in the life of the departed person, and the ancestor's soul descends undoubtedly upon his descendants, and reposes therein to enjoy the sacrifice offered. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Carr (2007:387-388) offers a contemporary explanation for ''shi'' "corpse" personation: [[Julian Jaynes]]'s psychological [[Bicameralism (psychology)|bicameralism]] hypothesis. Jaynes proposed that human "[[consciousness]]", meaning [[self-awareness]] and [[cognition]], began evolving around 1000 BCE. Prior to that, ancient people had "bicameral mentality" in which one part of the brain "spoke" (often in an [[authority figure]]'s voice) while another part listened and obeyed. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the theory of the bicameral mind, hallucinations of a person in some authority could continue after death as an everyday matter. And hence the almost universal custom of feeding the corpses after death, and burying them with the appurtenances of life. (Jaynes 1976:290) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
If the original personators were bicameral, they could have directly hallucinated voices from a ''shi'' "corpse". Carr notes the historical correspondence between Jaynes's first millennium BCE timeline for the breakdown of the bicameral mind in other parts of the world and the 11th-3rd centuries BCE personation practices in China.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Several early sources give variations of the same chronicle about the personation ceremony. It began during the Xia Dynasty, when personators would communicate on behalf of the dead; continued during the Shang and Western Zhou Dynasties; but was criticized and discontinued after the Eastern Zhou Dynasty when personators were no longer able to speak for the dead. (2007:387) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:SanXingDui ZongMuMianJu.jpg|thumb|[[Sanxingdui]] bronze mask]]
Wearing [[Ritual mask#Ritual masks|ritual masks]] is a recent hypothesis about ''shi''. Paper (1995:82) suggested the possibility that Shang and Zhou ''shi'' wore bronze masks "symbolizing the spirit of the dead to whom the sacrifices were offered". Liu believes the phantasmagoric bronze masks discovered at [[Sanxingdui]], dating from c. 12th-11th centuries BCE, might have been ritually worn by ''shi'' 尸.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''shi'' was generally a close, young relative who wore a costume (possibly including a mask) reproducing the features of the dead person. The ''shi'' was an impersonator, that is, a person serving as a reminder of the ancestor to whom sacrifice was being offered. During such a ceremony, the impersonator was much more than an actor in a drama. Although the exact meaning may have been different, the group of Sanxingdui masked figures in bronze all have the character of an impersonator. It is likely the masks were used to impersonate and identify with certain supernatural beings in order to effect some communal good. (2000:37) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Social studies of finance''' is an interdisciplinary research area that combines perspectives from [[anthropology]], [[economic sociology]], [[science and technology studies]], [[international political economy]], [[behavioral finance]], [[cultural studies]] and/or [[economics]] in the study of [[financial markets]]. Work in social studies of finance emphasises the social and cultural dimensions of financial activities, but focuses also on technical and economic dimensions such as pricing and trading.

==History==
Financial markets have been an object for sociological inquiry since, at least, [[Max Weber]]’s ''[[Die Börse]]''. The raise of quantitative financial theory in [[financial economics]] from the 1950s onwards has led to an academic specialization on financial markets rather focused on economic modeling, and poorly attentive to sociological aspects. In the 1980s, a number of economic sociologists developed empirical investigation on the social structure and cultural characteristics of financial markets, especially in the US. Such pioneering researcher included contributions from Wayne E. Baker, Mitchel Y. Abolafia and Charles W. Smith, and was based on methods such as ethnographic observation or [[social network analysis]]. In the 1990s, a number of researchers from the field of [[science and technology studies]] such as [[Karin Knorr-Cetina]] and [[Donald Angus MacKenzie|Donald A. MacKenzie]] started also developing empirical research in this area, with close attention to the role of expert knowledge and technology in financial activities.

==Main topics==
Research topics in social studies of finance include the cultural world and work habits of [[Trader (finance)|traders]] and other professionals in financial markets, the [[globalization]] and [[regulation]] of financial services, the processes of [[innovation]] in the financial industry and the problems of [[risk]] and [[uncertainty]] that characterize such processes.

The '''Soreq Nuclear Research Center''' ({{lang-he|המרכז למחקר גרעיני - שורק}}) is a research and development institute situated near the localities of [[Palmachim]] and [[Yavne]] in Israel. It operates under the auspices of the [[Israel Atomic Energy Commission]] (IAEC). The center conducts research in various physical sciences, particularly the development of many kinds of sensors, [[laser]]s, atmospheric research, [[Nondestructive testing|non-destructive testing]] techniques, space environment, nuclear safety, medical diagnostics and [[nuclear medicine]]. It is also one of three facilities in Israel which produce various types of [[radiopharmacology|radiopharmacuticals]] for use by health care organizations throughout the country.

The institute houses a wide array of laboratories and research facilities including an [[American Machine and Foundry|AMF]] 5 [[megawatt|MW]] [[Pool-type reactor|pool-type]] light water [[nuclear reactor]] supplied in the late 1950s from the United States under the [[Atoms for Peace]] program,&lt;ref name=archdaily&gt;[http://www.archdaily.com/398642/ad-classics-soreq-nuclear-research-center-philip-johnson/ Soreq Nuclear Research Center / Philip Johnson], Gili Merin, ArchDaily, 8 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; a 10 [[MeV]] [[proton]] [[cyclotron]] accelerator, and a continuous wave, 5-40 MeV, 0.04-5 mA proton and deuteron superconducting [[Linear particle accelerator|linear accelerator]] – the first phase of which was commissioned in 2013 (''see also:'' [[SARAF – Soreq Applied Research Accelerator Facility]]).

Commissioned by the Israeli government in 1956, the reactor building was designed by American architect [[Philip Johnson]].&lt;ref name=archdaily/&gt; With its distinctive brutalist style, it has appeared on stamps and was one of Johnson's favorite buildings, though security precautions prevented him from visiting the completed structure while in Israel in 1966.&lt;ref name=archdaily/&gt;

The Center is named after the nearby stream of [[Brook of Sorek|Soreq]].

The Center operates under the [[IAEA safeguards|safeguards]] of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuclear Research Center - Soreq|url=http://iaec.gov.il/English/Soreq/Pages/default.aspx|website=Israel Atomic Energy Commission website|publisher= [[Israel Atomic Energy Commission]]|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[political anthropology]], a '''theatre state''' is a political [[state (polity)|state]] directed towards the performance of [[drama]] and [[ritual]] rather than more conventional ends such as [[welfare state|welfare]]. Power in a theatre state is exercised through [[spectacle]]. The term was coined by [[Clifford Geertz]] in 1980 in reference to political practice in the nineteenth-century Balinese [[Negara, Bali|Negara]],&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, C. (1980) ''Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali''. [[Princeton University Press]]. {{ISBN|0691007780}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but its usage has since expanded. Hunik Kwon and Byung-Ho Chung, for example, argue that contemporary [[North Korea]] is a theatre state.&lt;ref&gt;Kwon, H. &amp; Chung, B-H. (2012) ''North Korea: Beyond Charismatic Politics''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, Chapter 2. {{ISBN|1442215771}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Geertz's original usage, the concept of the theatre state contests the notion that [[precolonial]] society can be analysed in the conventional discourse of [[Oriental despotism]].&lt;ref&gt;Heder, S. "Political Theatre in the 2003 Cambodian Elections", in Strauss, J. C. &amp; O'Brien, D. C. (eds.) (2007) ''Staging Politics: Power and Performance in Asia and Africa''. [[I. B. Tauris]], p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12684">The '''transpersonal''' is a term used by different schools of philosophy and psychology in order to describe experiences and worldviews that extend beyond the personal level of the psyche, and beyond mundane worldly events. 

==Definition and context==

The transpersonal has been defined as experiences ''in which the sense of identity or self extends beyond (trans) the individual or personal to encompass wider aspects of humankind, life, psyche or cosmos''. &lt;ref name="Walsh &amp; Vaughan 1993"&gt; Walsh, R. and F. Vaughan. "On transpersonal definitions". ''Journal of Transpersonal Psychology''. Vol. 25, No2, pp. 199-207, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The field of Transpersonal Psychiatry has defined the term as "development beyond conventional, personal or individual levels." &lt;ref name="Scotton et.al 1996"&gt; Scotton, Bruce W. "Introduction and Definition of Transpersonal Psychiatry". In Scotton, Bruce W., Chinen, Allan B. and Battista, John R., Eds. (1996) Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology. New York: Basic Books. &lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand; ''transpersonal practices are those structured activities that focus on inducing transpersonal experiences''.&lt;ref name="Walsh &amp; Vaughan 1993"/&gt;

One of the founders of the field of [[transpersonal psychology]], [[Stanislav Grof]], has defined transpersonal states of awareness as such: ''The common denominator of this otherwise rich and ramified group of phenomena is the feeling of the individual that his consciousness expanded beyond the usual ego boundaries and the limitations of time and space''.&lt;ref name="Grof 1993"&gt; Grof, Stanislav. (1975, 1993). Realms of the Human Unconscious: Observations from LSD Research. New York: Viking, London: Souvenir Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term is related to the terminology of peak experience, altered states of consciousness, and spiritual experiences. &lt;ref name="Miller 1998"&gt; Miller, John J. "Book Review: Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology". ''Psychiatric Services'' 49:541-542, April 1998. American Psychiatric Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grabovac &amp; Ganesan 2003"&gt; Grabovac, Andrea D. &amp; Ganesan, Soma. "Spirituality and Religion in Canadian Psychiatric Residency Training". ''Canadian Journal of Psychiatry'', Vol 48, No 3, April 2003&lt;/ref&gt; {{ref|a|Note a}} The term is also associated with psychedelic work, and psychotechnologies, that includes research with psychedelic plants and chemicals such as LSD, ibogaine, ketamine, peyote, ayahuasca and the vast variety of substances available to all human cultures throughout history.{{ref|b|Note b}}

==Origin of the term==

The term has an early precedent in the writing of philosopher [[William James]], who used the term "Trans-personal" in one of his lectures from 1905. &lt;ref name="Vich 1988"&gt; Vich, M.A. (1988) "Some historical sources of the term 'Transpersonal' ". ''Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'', 20 (2) 107-110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeman 2006"&gt;  Freeman, Anthony. "A Daniel Come To Judgement? Dennett and the Revisioning of Transpersonal Theory". ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'', 13, No. 3, 2006, pp. 95–109&lt;/ref&gt; However, this early terminology, introduced by James, had a different meaning than the current one &lt;ref name="Freeman 2006"/&gt; and its context was philosophy, not psychology, &lt;ref name="Vich 1988"/&gt; which is where the term is mostly used these days.

There has also been some speculation of an early precedent of the term in the writings of [[Carl Jung]], as a result of the work of Jung's translators. It regards the jungian term ''ueberpersonlich'', used by Jung in a paper from 1917, which in later english translations appeared as ''superpersonal'', and later, ''transpersonal''.&lt;ref name="Vich 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scotton et.al 1996"/&gt; {{ref|c|Note c}} In a later, revised, version of the ''Psychology of the Unconscious'' (1942) there was even a chapter heading called ''The Personal and the Collective (or Transpersonal) Unconscious''. &lt;ref name="Vich 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lukoff &amp; Lu 2005"&gt; Lukoff, David and Lu, Francis. ''A Transpersonal-Integrative Approach to Spiritually Oriented Psychotherapy'', in L. Sperry and E. P. Shafranske (2005) Spiritually Oriented Psychotherapy, American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, the origin of the term transpersonal, as it is currently used in academic writing, is mostly associated with the [[human potential movement]] of the 1960s and the founders of the field of [[Transpersonal psychology]]; Anthony Sutich, [[Abraham Maslow]] and [[Stanislav Grof]]. &lt;ref name="Valle &amp; Harari 1985"&gt; Valle, Ronald S. &amp; Harari, Carmi. Current developments in...Transpersonal Psychology. ''The Humanistic Psychologist'', 11, Vol. 13, NO. 1, Winter 1985&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Vich 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Judy 1994"&gt; Judy, Dwight. Transpersonal psychology: Coming of age. ''ReVision'', 02756935, Winter94, Vol. 16, Issue 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferrer2002"&gt; Ferrer, J. N. (2002). "Revisioning transpersonal theory: A participatory vision of human spirituality". Albany,NY: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lukoff &amp; Lu 2005"/&gt; According to Vich &lt;ref name="Vich 1988"/&gt; all three had used the term as early as 1967, in order to describe new ideas in the field of Psychology. In 1968 the term was selected by the founding editors of the [[Journal of Transpersonal Psychology]], Abraham Maslow and Anthony Sutich, in order to represent a new area of psychological inquiry. &lt;ref name="Vich 1988"/&gt;{{ref|d|Note d}} According to Powers &lt;ref name="Powers 2005"&gt; Powers, Robin. "Counseling and Spirituality: A Historical Review". ''Counseling and Values'', Apr 2005, Vol.49(3), pp.217-225.&lt;/ref&gt; the term “transpersonal” starts to show up in academic journals from 1970 and onwards.

==The transpersonal movement==

The collective of people and organizations with an interest in the ''transpersonal'' is called the ''transpersonal movement''. Walsh and Vaughan&lt;ref name="Walsh &amp; Vaughan 1993"/&gt; defines the transpersonal movement as ''the interdisciplinary movement that includes various individual transpersonal disciplines''. 

The philosophy of [[William James]], the school of [[Psychosynthesis]] (founded by Roberto Assagioli), and the Analytical school of [[Carl Jung]] are often considered to be forerunners to the establishment of transpersonal theory.&lt;ref name="Miller 1998"/&gt; However, the start of the movement is associated with the emergence and growth of the related field of [[Humanistic Psychology]]. Several of the academic profiles of the early transpersonal movement, such as [[Abraham Maslow]] and Anthony Sutich, had their background in Humanistic Psychology. &lt;ref name="Keutzer 1984"&gt;Keutzer, C.S. Transpersonal Psychotherapy: Reflections on the Genre. ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice'', 1984, Vol. 15, No. 6, 868-883&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valle &amp; Harari 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor 1992"&gt;Taylor, Eugene. Transpersonal Psychology: Its several Virtues. ''The Humanistic Psychologist'', Vol. 20, Nos. 2 and 3, pp. 285-300, 1992. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh 1993"&gt; Walsh, R. The Transpersonal Movement: A History and State of the Art. ''Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'', 1993, Vol. 25, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  

The formative years of the transpersonal movement can be characterized by the founding of a few key organizations and institutions, such as: the [[Institute of Noetic Sciences]] in 1973, ''The International Transpersonal Psychology Association'' in 1973, [[Naropa University|Naropa Institute]] in 1974, and the [[Sofia University (California)|California Institute of Transpersonal Psychology]] in 1975.&lt;ref name="Taylor 1992"/&gt; The ''California Institute of Transpersonal Psychology'' later emerged as the ''Institute of Transpersonal Psychology'' and is today known as [[Sofia University (California)|Sofia University]]. 

Contemporary [[transpersonal disciplines]] include [[Transpersonal psychology]], [[Transpersonal anthropology]], [[Transpersonal sociology]] and [[Transpersonal ecology]]. Other academic orientations, whose main focus lies elsewhere, but that are associated with a transpersonal perspective, include [[Humanistic psychology]] and [[Near-Death Studies]]. &lt;ref name="Scotton Chinen Battista"&gt; Scotton, B.W., Chinen, A.B. and Battista, J.R. (ed. 1996). ''Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary institutions include: the [[Association for Transpersonal Psychology]] (ATP), the ''European Transpersonal Psychology Association'' (EPTA), the ''International Transpersonal Association'' (ITA), and the ''European Transpersonal Association'' (Eurotas). Leading publications within the movement include: the [[Journal of Transpersonal Psychology]], the [[International Journal of Transpersonal Studies]], and the ''Journal of Transpersonal Research''.

==Transpersonal studies==

Several commentators note how the transpersonal field, and its vision, moved beyond the perspective of psychology and into other transpersonal domains during the 1980's and 1990's.&lt;ref name="Grof Friedman Lukoff Hartelius"&gt;Grof, S., Friedman, H., Lukoff, D., &amp; Hartelius, G. (2008). The past and future of the International Transpersonal Association. ''International Journal of Transpersonal Studies'', 27(1), 55–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Caplan Hartelius Rardin"&gt;Caplan, Hartelius &amp; Rardin. Contemporary viewpoints on Transpersonal Psychology. ''The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'', 2003, Vol. 35, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This expansion of the transpersonal concept resulted in an interdisciplinary situation, and a dialogue with such fields as [[social work]], [[ecology]], [[art]], [[literature]], [[acting]], [[law]], [[business]], [[entrepreneurship]], [[ecopsychology]], [[feminism]] and [[education]].&lt;ref name="Caplan Hartelius Rardin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grof Friedman Lukoff Hartelius"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlas"&gt;Atlas, N. (2016). (Book Review) The Wiley-Blackwell handbook of transpersonal psychology, by Harris L. Friedman &amp; Glenn Hartelius (Eds.) ''International Journal of Transpersonal Studies'', 35 (2).&lt;/ref&gt;

In this respect, commentators have suggested that there is a difference between the founding field of [[Transpersonal psychology]] and a broader field of Transpersonal inquiry, known as ''Transpersonal studies''.&lt;ref name="Chinen 1996"&gt;Chinen, Allan B. ''The emergence of Transpersonal psychiatry''. In Scotton, Bruce W., Chinen, Allan B. and Battista, John R., Eds. (1996) ''Textbook of Transpersonal Psychiatry and Psychology''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman 2002"&gt; Friedman, H. (2002). Transpersonal psychology as a scientific field. ''International Journal of Transpersonal Studies'', 21(1), 175–187.&lt;/ref&gt; This differentiation of the Transpersonal field has to do with the scope of the subjects under study, and the interest of researchers and theorists. 

In their review of transpersonal definitions, published in 1993, Walsh and Vaughan&lt;ref name="Walsh &amp; Vaughan 1993"/&gt; noted that ''Transpersonal studies'' had grown beyond the founding field of [[Transpersonal psychology]]. Commenting on the criticisms of Transpersonal psychology in the 1980's, Chinen &lt;ref name="Chinen 1996"/&gt; noted how the criticism did not differentiate between Transpersonal psychology, on the one hand, and a broad range of popularized transpersonal orientations, on the other. The same line of reasoning was picked up by Friedman,&lt;ref name="Friedman 2002"/&gt; who differentiated between a broad domain of inquiry known as Transpersonal studies, and a more narrow field of Transpersonal psychology. Both authors argued that the confounding of the two domains resulted in confusion. In a ''summary of contemporary viewpoints on Transpersonal psychology'' [[Jorge Ferrer]]&lt;ref name="Caplan Hartelius Rardin"/&gt; placed Transpersonal psychology within the wider "umbrella" known as ''Transpersonal studies''.

The [[International Journal of Transpersonal Studies]] was established in 1981. It is sponsored by the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]], and serves as the official publication of the International Transpersonal Association.&lt;ref name="Atlas"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9678">The '''University of Chicago Extension Division Library School''' was one of the pioneering training programs for librarians in the [[United States]]. The library school was a section within the Extension Division's Class-Study Department.&lt;ref name=classes&gt;"University of Chicago library classes."&lt;/ref&gt; It closed in 1903 after receiving controversial criticisms from the [[American Library Association]].

==History==

===Beginnings===
The University of Chicago Extension Division began offering courses in “[[Library science#19th century|library economy]]” in January 1897.&lt;ref name=Grotzinger&gt;Grotzinger, 1966, p. 220-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The courses covered such topics as the history of library economy to 1870, bookbinding, and how to use libraries.&lt;ref&gt;University Extension Division, 1896.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 1897-1898 school year, the program began focusing more on library work and offered three courses: "The Modern Library Movement," "Cataloging and Classification," and "Bibliography and Reference Work."&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 1897.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, it offered the courses "Historical and Literary Outlines of Library Economy," "Technical Methods," and "Bibliography and Reference Work."&lt;ref name=Dixson&gt;Dixson Papers&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, the course "Principles of Library Administration" was also added.&lt;ref name=Stauffer2&gt;Stauffer, pg. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shift to Library Training===
By 1900, the library courses had completely transformed into a school for training librarians with [[Zella Allen Dixson]] as the instructor and director.&lt;ref name=Stauffer&gt;Stauffer, pg. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Students were required to have at least two years of college experience before being admitted into the program.&lt;ref name=Stauffer2/&gt; While students of any major were allowed to enroll, credits were only granted to those who were library students.&lt;ref name=Stauffer6&gt;Stauffer, pg. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Each course met once a week for a two-hour session with the entire program taking two years to complete.&lt;ref name=Stauffer2/&gt; The school used a learn-by-doing strategy in which students worked in the university library. There were three faculty members: Dixson, cataloger Josephine Robertson, and [[Mary E. Downey]].&lt;ref name=Stauffer3&gt;Stauffer, pg. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Robertson’s requests, the library science courses never became a degree program and instead offered only a certificate to students.&lt;ref name=Stauffer4&gt;Stauffer, pg. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy &amp; Closure===
The [[American Library Association]]’s [[Association of College and Research Libraries|College and Reference Library Section]] sent a letter to [[University of Chicago]] President [[William Rainey Harper]] criticizing the library school.&lt;ref name=Stauffer/&gt; The exact criticisms were that there were no entrance requirements, only 200 hours were required to complete the program, there was only one instructor (Dixson) and she was incompetent, the program did not provide the opportunity to apply the skills being taught, and the students were promised jobs that they did not receive.&lt;ref name=Stauffer4/&gt; Dixson denied each of these allegations and stated her belief that information about the Extension Division and the success of the library school's graduates had been suppressed from the major professional journals of the time.&lt;ref name=Stauffer4/&gt; She also claimed that [[Katharine Sharp]], who had founded and directed the library school at the [[University of Illinois]] in Urbana, hated everything associated with the University of Chicago and was working with [[Melvil Dewey]] of the ALA’s College Library Section to eliminate the competition the Extension Division program created with her school.&lt;ref name=Stauffer4/&gt; Dixson wrote a letter to Harper reminding him that, if he decided to close down the program, it would cost the university thousands of dollars in returned tuition and cause the school’s library to lose its student workers.&lt;ref name=Stauffer4/&gt; Faculty member and alumna Mary E. Downey also wrote a letter defending the program. In it, she stated that she chose the University of Chicago Extension Division because it was more practical than several other library schools, including the one at the University of Illinois.&lt;ref name=Stauffer5&gt;Stauffer, pg. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1903, the ALA’s Committee on Library Training issued a report evaluating different library science programs. The committee consisted of the directors of six of the programs evaluated in the report, including Katharine Sharp of the University of Illinois.&lt;ref name=Stauffer5/&gt; The report incorrectly named cataloger Josephine Robertson as the director of the University of Chicago Extension Division’s library school and the training program’s sole instructor. The report went on to state that the program’s admissions requirements were inadequate and that either three years of college or an entrance examination should be required. It also criticized the school for allowing students to only partially complete the program, saying that this policy could cause confusion among potential employers who may believe that the students are all qualified graduates.&lt;ref name=Stauffer5/&gt;

In October 1903, Harper decided to close the Extension Division's library school. The dean of the University College received many letters of protests, including one from Mary E. Downey who was acting as President of the University of Chicago Library Students Club. Downey requested the school show loyalty to its students by keeping the program open and continuing its work.&lt;ref name=Stauffer5/&gt; The letters did not dissuade Harper from closing the library school.

The '''valuation of nonmarket housework''' comprises attempts to attach value to non-exchange domestic tasks. Housework may include a variety of activities, particularly those traditionally associated with [[housekeeping]] (or [[homemaking]]), along with child care and nurturing. These activities have recognizable economic and social significance, but are not included in standard economic measurements, such as the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). While the symbolic or subjective benefits of housework are difficult to measure, various attempts have been made to attach value to economically productive household activity.

==Economic Valuation==

===''Tracking Measures''===

Traditional means of tracking economic activity, such as the gross domestic product (GDP), do not take account of non-exchange, nonmarket household activity. Therefore, various adjustments to GDP calculations and novel measurements have been proposed, such as the GPI or GHP.

====Gross domestic product ([[Gross domestic product|GDP]])====

In 2012, the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis|US Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis]] (BEA) created an adjusted measure of GDP to account for productive household activity.&lt;ref name=Bridgman&gt;{{cite web|last=Bridgman|first=Benjamin|title=Accounting for Household Production in the National Accounts, 1965 - 2010|url=https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/05%20May/0512_household.pd|publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis Repor|accessdate=17 February 2014|archivedate=May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By using detailed [[time use survey]]s for the period 1965-2010, the BEA found that incorporating “nonmarket household production” raises the GDP measure by 39% in 1965 and 26% in 2010.&lt;ref name=Bridgman&gt;{{cite web|last=Bridgman|first=Benjamin|title=Accounting for Household Production in the National Accounts, 1965 - 2010|url=https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/05%20May/0512_household.pd|publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis Repor|accessdate=17 February 2014|archivedate=May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The surveys used seven categories of time use in American household production (housework, cooking, odd jobs, gardening, shopping, child care, and domestic travel) and the BEA assigned a low-end market wage to the hours spent on each activity.&lt;ref name=Bridgman&gt;{{cite web|last=Bridgman|first=Benjamin|title=Accounting for Household Production in the National Accounts, 1965 - 2010|url=https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/05%20May/0512_household.pd|publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis Repor|accessdate=17 February 2014|archivedate=May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declining impact on the adjusted GDP reflects the steadily decreasing number of (nonmarket) hours households spent on home production. While men increased their weekly hours of home production in the time span from 14 to 17, this increase was more than offset by the decline in women's home production from 40 to 26 hours.&lt;ref name=Bridgman&gt;{{cite web|last=Bridgman|first=Benjamin|title=Accounting for Household Production in the National Accounts, 1965 - 2010|url=https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/05%20May/0512_household.pd|publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis Repor|accessdate=17 February 2014|archivedate=May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The BEA explains this shift by increased women's participation in the work force as well as the steadily decreasing market wages of household workers (such as cleaners and nannies), raising the opportunity costs of self-participation and encouraging outsourcing.&lt;ref name=Bridgman&gt;{{cite web|last=Bridgman|first=Benjamin|title=Accounting for Household Production in the National Accounts, 1965 - 2010|url=https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/05%20May/0512_household.pd|publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis Repor|accessdate=17 February 2014|archivedate=May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Genuine progress indicator ([[Genuine progress indicator|GPI]])====

The [[Genuine progress indicator|GPI]] is an alternative to GDP as a measure of economic growth that is generally designed to incorporate environmental and social factors that are not traditionally included. While much of the focus is typically placed on environmental costs, most GPI measurements explicitly include additions for the value of household work and parenting.

One of the most well-known examples is the GPI measure used across Atlantic Canada. In a 1999 report &lt;ref name="GPI Atlantic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Equality in the Genuine Progress Index|url=http://www.gpiatlantic.org/pdf/misc/genderequality.pdf|publisher=GPI Atlantic|accessdate=17 February 2014|year=October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GPI Atlantic describes the household production infrastructure as akin to the access to raw materials, labour and markets required for the business sector.&lt;ref name="GPI Atlantic"/&gt; The Atlantic GPI employs time use variables and assigns explicit monetary values to [[unpaid work]] according to its replacement value in the market. According to their (1999) measurements, “unpaid work contributes $325 billion worth of services to the Canadian economy annually” and they argue that GPI analysis should be explicitly incorporated into policy considerations.&lt;ref name="GPI Atlantic"/&gt;

====Gross household product (GHP)====

Gross household product is a specific estimation of the economic value added by the unpaid work and capital of households.&lt;ref name=Ironmonger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ironmonger|first=Duncan|author2=Faye Soupourmas |title=Output-Based Estimates of the Gross Household Product of the United States 2003-2010|date=Aug 2012|url=http://www.iariw.org/papers/2012/IronmongerPaper.pdf|accessdate=17 February 2014|publisher=The International Association for Research in Income and Wealth}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not include many of the additional factors typically included in GPI determinations but focuses specifically on the “household economy.” [[Duncan Ironmonger]] defines a country's Gross Economic Product as comprising both the Gross Market Product (typically defined as GDP) and Gross Household Product. Using one of the same time use surveys as the BEA study referenced above (the American Time Use Survey), Ironmonger estimates the USA's 2011 GHP at 11.6 trillion dollars (as compared to a GDP of 13.3 trillion).&lt;ref name=Ironmonger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ironmonger|first=Duncan|author2=Faye Soupourmas |title=Output-Based Estimates of the Gross Household Product of the United States 2003-2010|date=Aug 2012|url=http://www.iariw.org/papers/2012/IronmongerPaper.pdf|accessdate=17 February 2014|publisher=The International Association for Research in Income and Wealth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Approaches to the Economic Valuation of Housework''====

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] report ''Cooking, Caring and Volunteering: Unpaid Work Around the World'' defines unpaid work as, “the production of goods and services by household members that are not sold on the market” .&lt;ref name=Miranda&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miranda|first=V.|title=Cooking, Caring and Volunteering: Unpaid Work Around the World|journal=OECD Social, Employment and Migration Working Papers|year=2011|issue=116|doi=10.1787/5kghrjm8s142-en |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5kghrjm8s142-en |accessdate=17 February 2014|publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It uses the “third-person” rule &lt;ref name=Reid&gt;{{cite book|last=Reid|first=Margaret|title=Economics of Household Production|year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to distinguish between work and leisure, claiming that if a third person can be paid to do the activity while benefiting the household, it is work.

While paid work outside of the home is readily measurable, housework is much more difficult to calculate. A number of models have been created to determine the value of work in the home, each with different conceptualizations of the process. There is currently no consensus on the appropriate approach.

These methods are generally divided into two main camps: the [[opportunity cost]] approach and the [[market value]] approach. The former views housework as equivalent to the amount one would make in the labour market. Housework is therefore evaluated at the wage rate that the member would otherwise have received. The market value approach bases the value of work done in the home on the cost of hiring someone to do the same job.{{sfn|Ferber|Birnbaum|1980|page=388}}&lt;ref name=ferber&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferber|first=M.A.|author2=Birnbaum, B.G. |title=Housework: Priceless or Valueless?|journal=Review of Income and Wealth|year=1980|volume=26|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither method is without criticism.

The opportunity cost method is flawed in that it is difficult to pinpoint a comparator group. Not all workers have their choice of job, nor the number of hours they work.{{sfn|Ferber|Birnbaum|1980|pages=387–389}} Furthermore, wages vary depending on the location of the job and the gender of the employee, and the time it takes to get to and from work is not factored into the calculation.{{sfn|Ferber|Birnbaum|1980|pages=387–388 &amp; 391}} Age, level of education, and work experience are good predictors of what one would make in the labour market, but they are simply a subset of the aspects that can be used to calculate what a house worker would make.{{sfn|Ferber|Birnbaum|1980|pages=387–389}} Therefore, while many studies regarding the valuation of work in the home have attempted to come up with a standard wage and multiply it by the number of hours worked, there is no agreement as to how this standard wage should be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldschmidt-Clermont|first=L.|title=Unpaid work in the household.|year=1983|publisher=International Labor Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The market value approach comes with its own set of flaws. One type of approach within this category is the Direct Output Method, which is based on the value of production rather than the hours of labour performed in the household.&lt;ref name="Ciscel 215"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ciscel|first=David H|author2=Heath, Julia |author3=Sharp, David |title=Back To Becker: valuing women's economic contribution from housework with household production functions|journal=Journal of Forensic Economics|date=Fall 1998|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It solves the problem of having to come up with a standard wage,&lt;ref name="Ciscel 215"/&gt; but it is inherently difficult to obtain data on production output (e.g., number of pants folded) in the home. Furthermore, comparing the value of individual tasks performed to the average market price it would cost to get that same task completed may not be accurate, as multiple tasks can and are often done simultaneously in the home. To counteract this problem, one can construct a valuation based on the total wages of a housekeeper who performs a similar set of tasks.{{sfn|Ferber|Birnbaum|1980|pages=387–388 &amp; 391}} Yet, even then, the model does not take into account that men and women in the labour market often do housework, but hire housekeepers to do specific jobs that may require particular skills or expertise and demand a higher wage as a result.{{sfn|Ferber|Birnbaum|1980|pages=387–388 &amp; 391}}

Overall, while these methods have attempted to create ways to determine the value of household labour, there is no accepted approach.

===Gender Disparity===

Despite women's increased participation in the work force, several North American studies show that women still engage in significantly more housework activity than men.

A recent study by [[Statistics Canada]] indicates that while men and women participate (nearly) equally in the labour force, women spend far more hours on unpaid housework, such as child care and domestic work (including house cleaning, cooking, yard work and home maintenance).&lt;ref name="Milan 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milan|first=Anne|title=Families, Living Arrangements and Unpaid Work: Women in Canada: A Gender-based Statistical Report|year=2011|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-503-x/2010001/article/11546-eng.htm.|accessdate=17 February 2014|publisher=Statistics Canada|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, it was found that men spend an average of 24.4 hours per week on child care, while women spend 50.1 hours on the same tasks.&lt;ref name="Milan 2011"/&gt; In the domestic work category, men conduct 8.3 hours of unpaid work, compared with 13.8 hours per week for women.&lt;ref name="Milan 2011"/&gt;

According to GPI Atlantic, “[t]ime use surveys reveal that Canadian women spend about twice as much time on total unpaid household work, including child and elder care, as men. They spend three times as long cooking and washing dishes, and nearly seven times as much time cleaning house and doing laundry”.&lt;ref name="GPI Atlantic 5"&gt;{{cite journal|last=GPI Atlantic|title=Gender Equality in the Genuine Progress Index|date=October 1999|page=5|url=http://www.gpiatlantic.org/pdf/misc/genderequality.pdf|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is despite a doubling of the female labour force from 1960-1999.&lt;ref name="GPI Atlantic 5"/&gt;  The report argues that due to the invisibility of unpaid household production in traditional economic measures (like GDP), women are subject to wage and gender discrimination that has significant adverse effects on their economic well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=GPI Atlantic|title=Gender Equality in the Genuine Progress Index|date=October 1999|page=7|url=http://www.gpiatlantic.org/pdf/misc/genderequality.pdf|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, the US Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis found a smaller discrepancy between genders on productive (but nonmarket) housework. According to their May 2012 report, women spend approximately 26 hours per week on home production, as opposed to 17 hours for men. Note, however, that the tasks included vary significantly between studies.&lt;ref name=Bridgman&gt;{{cite web|last=Bridgman|first=Benjamin|title=Accounting for Household Production in the National Accounts, 1965 - 2010|url=https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/05%20May/0512_household.pd|publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis Repor|accessdate=17 February 2014|archivedate=May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5552">'''Wisdom literature''' is a [[genre]] of [[literature]] common in the [[ancient Near East]]. It consists of statements by [[sage (philosophy)|sages]] and [[Wisdom|wise]] men that offer teachings about divinity and [[virtue]]. Although this genre uses techniques of traditional oral story-telling, it was disseminated in written form.

The literary genre of [[mirrors for princes]], which has a long history in [[Islamic literature|Islamic]] and Western [[Renaissance literature]], is a secular cognate of wisdom literature. In [[Classical Antiquity]], the [[didactic]] poetry of [[Hesiod]], particularly his ''[[Works and Days]],'' was regarded as a source of knowledge similar to the wisdom literature of [[Egypt]], [[Babylonia]], and [[Israel]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==Ancient Egyptian literature==
{{Main article|Ancient Egyptian philosophy}}
{{Expand section|date=July 2011}}
In [[ancient Egyptian literature]], wisdom literature belonged to the ''[[sebayt]]'' ("teaching") genre which flourished during the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] and became [[canon (basic principle)|canon]]ical during the [[New Kingdom]]. Notable works of this genre include the ''[[Instructions of Kagemni]]'', ''[[The Maxims of Ptahhotep]]'', the ''[[Instructions of Amenemhat]]'', and the ''[[Loyalist Teaching]]''.

==Biblical wisdom literature and Jewish texts==
The most famous examples of wisdom literature are found in the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James L. Crenshaw|Crenshaw, James L.]] ''"The Wisdom Literature"'', in Knight, Douglas A. and Tucker, Gene M. (eds), ''The Hebrew Bible and Its Modern Interpreters'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Bernhard W.|authorlink=Bernhard Anderson|title=The Living World of the Old Testament|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X2sOAQAAIAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Longmans|pages=570ff|chapter=The Beginning of Widom – Israels Wisdom literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sapiential Books ===
&lt;!--"Sapiential Books" redirects here--&gt;
The term "Sapiential Books" or "Books of Wisdom" is used in [[biblical studies]] to refer to a subset of the books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] in the [[Septuagint]] translation. There are seven of these books, namely the books of [[Book of Job|Job]], [[Psalms]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], [[Ecclesiastes]], the [[Song of Songs]] (Song of Solomon), the [[Book of Wisdom]] and [[Sirach]] (Ecclesiasticus). Not all the Psalms are usually regarded as belonging to the Wisdom tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Estes, D.

In [[Judaism]], the Books of Wisdom other than the Wisdom of Solomon and Sirach are regarded as part of the ''[[Ketuvim]]'' or "Writings". In [[Christianity]], Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes are included in the [[Old Testament]] by all traditions, while Wisdom, and Sirach are regarded in some traditions as [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]] works which are placed in the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]] within the Anglican and Protestant [[Bible translations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{wwbible|Old Testament, 355–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sapiential Books are in the broad tradition of wisdom literature that was found widely in the [[Ancient Near East]], including many religions other than Judaism.

The Greek noun ''[[Sophia (wisdom)|sophia]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:σοφία#Ancient Greek|σοφῐ́ᾱ]]}}, {{transl|grc|sophíā}}) is the translation of "wisdom" in the Greek [[Septuagint]] for [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] ''Ḥokmot'' ({{rtl-lang|he|[[wikt:חכמות|חכמות]]}}, {{transl|he|khakhamút}}). Wisdom is a central topic in the "Sapiential" Books, i.e., [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], [[Psalms]], [[Book of Job|Job]], [[Song of Songs]], [[Ecclesiastes]], [[Book of Wisdom]], [[Wisdom of Sirach]], and to some extent [[Book of Baruch|Baruch]] (the last three are [[Biblical Apocrypha|Apocryphal]] / [[Deuterocanonical books]] of the [[Old Testament]]).
