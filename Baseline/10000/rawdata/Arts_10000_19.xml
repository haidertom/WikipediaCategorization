'''Addis Video Art [[Festival]]''' is an annual international [[video art]] [[festival]] in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]].

Addis Video Art Festival intends to provide a platform for innovative video art in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The festival will screen throughout the city in a variety of locations including street corners, rooftops, public centers and art centers. By sharing video art in both conventional and non-conventional settings, the festival will reach both the artist community and the everyday passerby. The festival aims to create a dialogue between local, and international artists by promoting and encouraging [[digital media]] culture.

In modern usage, an '''aquamanile''' (plural '''aquamanilia''' or simply '''aquamaniles''') is a [[ewer]] or [[Jug (container)|jug]]-type vessel in the form of one or more animal or human figures.  It usually contained water for the washing of hands (''aqua'' + ''manos'') over a basin, which was part of both upper-class meals and the Christian [[Eucharist]].  Historically the term was sometimes used for any shape of basin or ewer so used, regardless of shape.  Most surviving examples are in metal, typically [[copper alloy]]s ([[brass]] or [[bronze]]), as pottery versions have rarely survived.

==Islamic art==
Persian aquamaniles predate any zoomorphic aquamaniles known in Europe. An Iranian (Abbasid caliphate), Aquamanile in the form of an eagle, bearing the date 180 AH/CE 796-797, of bronze, inlaid with silver and copper, in the [[State Hermitage Museum]], St. Petersburg, is the earliest dated Islamic object in metalwork.&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovsky M.B. and Rogers, J.M. (eds), ''Heaven on Earth: Art from Islamic Lands'', pp. 80-81, 2004, Prestel, {{ISBN|3791330551}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the latest in date is one also at the State Hermitage Museum, a late Islamic aquamanile from [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], dated 1206.&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovsky M.B. and Rogers, J.M. (eds), ''Heaven on Earth: Art from Islamic Lands'', p. 89, 2004, Prestel, {{ISBN|3791330551}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aniconism in Islam|Islamic law deprecated]] the use of such representational figures, and the Islamic zoomorphic aquamanile tradition died out.

However the tradition was taken up enthusiastically in Europe, where the form remained popular until the Renaissance.

==Europe==
[[File:Aquamanile in the Form of a Lion MET DP117252.jpg|thumb|left|''Aquamanile in the Form of a Lion'', [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Aquamanile_in_the_Form_of_a_Lion_MET_DP117252.jpg Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]
[[File:Equestrian Knight Aquamanile.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze aquamanile in the form of a mounted knight, second half of the 13th century, [[Lower Saxony]] ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]])]]
The [[Byzantine Empire]]'s cultural connections with [[Sassanid|Sassanid Persia]] and the [[Abbasid]] caliphate, never peaceful in the political sphere, nevertheless brought the aquamanile into the Christian Mediterranean world. The earliest European portable aquamaniles date to the eleventh century.
Ewers and basins were needed in  [[Christian liturgy]] for the ritual of the [[lavabo]], in which the officiating priest washes his hands before vesting, again before the consecration of the Eucharist and after mass.  As a ritual object, metal was considered more suitable than pottery, although most examples in pottery no doubt were broken and discarded. The aquamaniles made in the [[Mosan art|Mosan]] – or [[Meuse]] valley – region, using the [[brass]] alloy of silvery tint called ''dinanderie'' (from the center of its manufacture in the region of [[Dinant]]) were often fantastic and zoomorphic in their forms, which were constrained only by the need for a larger opening for filling the vessel and a spout for pouring. Church records inventory aquamaniles in silver or gilt copper, but the great majority of surviving examples are in base metals, which were not worth melting down.


[[File:Aguamanil medieval paloma (M.A.N. Inv.2005-72-1) 01.jpg|thumb|upright|left|An 11–12th century [[Islamic art|Islamic]] aquamanile from [[Iran]], later used in liturgy by [[Spain in the Middle Ages|Medieval Spanish]] Christians ([[National Archaeological Museum of Spain|M.A.N.]], [[Madrid]])]]
[[File:Aquamanile Aachener Domschatz.jpg|thumb|Aquamanile, about 1170/80, ([[Aachen Cathedral Treasury]])]]

As well as the altar, aquamaniles were used at the tables of the great, where extravagant designs of symbolic or fantastical beasts – lions were especially popular – were developed in purely secular [[iconography]]. A gold aquamanile, c. 1215, in the treasury of the [[Aachen Cathedral|cathedral]] at [[Aachen]], takes the form of a man's bust; it is a rare survival of an aquamanile in a precious metal. An aquamanile (ref. Metropolitan Museum) in the form of [[Aristotle]] on hands and knees, being ridden by Phyllis, bore several moral lessons, with ribald undertones; such an aquamanile was distinctly secular in nature.

Bronze aquamaniles in the form of leopards were part of court ritual in [[Benin]], where the concept may have arrived from the Islamic north. An 18th-century bronze leopard aquamanile from Benin is in the collection of the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]].

From the Renaissance elaborate versions of the conventional ewer were preferred to zoomorphic forms.  A late version of the aquamanile was the silver-gilt mounted rider on a stand, bought in 1700 for the treasury of the [[Basilica of St-Denis]] and sold in 1798. Its form is recorded in an engraving by Félibien. (ref. St-Denis) The idea of [[ewer]]s in fantastic shapes has never died out.

The [[Indiana University]] '''Archives of Traditional Music''' holds over 100,000 audio and video individual recordings across over 3500 collections of field, broadcast, and commercial recordings. Its holdings are primarily focused on audiovisual recordings relating to research in the academic disciplines of [[ethnomusicology]], [[folklore]], [[anthropology]], [[linguistics]], and various area studies.

==History==
The archive was initiated by [[George Herzog]] at [[Columbia University]] in 1936.  It was modeled on the [[Berliner Phonogramm-Archiv]], where Herzog had worked as an assistant to [[Erich von Hornbostel|Erich M. von Hornbostel]] from 1921–1924. Herzog brought the nascent archive to [[Indiana University]] in 1948 when he was appointed as professor in the Department of Anthropology. The archive was formally established at Indiana University in 1954 under its second director, [[George List]], as the Archives of Folk and Primitive Music.  Its present name, the Archives of Traditional Music, was adopted in 1964 when it became a division of the Folklore Institute.&lt;ref name="ATM Booklet"&gt;{{cite book|title=Archives of Traditional Music Folklore Institute|date=1970|publisher=Indiana University Archives of Traditional Music Folklore Institute|location=Bloomington, IN|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==
Following insights gained through the Sound Directions Project about a looming crisis in time-based media preservation, staff at the ATM pursued a collaborative strategy for saving its media holdings. In 2008, they participated in a small coalition of archivists and librarians at Indiana University that began a survey of the audio-visual materials held on the Bloomington Campus. The survey was prompted by the recognition that the university held a large amount of time-based media in danger of deterioration and playback obsolescence. This survey revealed that the Bloomington campus held more than a half-million audiovisual recordings across eighty units and that large portions of the University's holdings were at risk for loss. Following the publication of a survey report in 2009, the Office of the Vice Provost for Research funded a preservation planning document under the aegis of what was known as the Media Preservation Initiative (MPI).&lt;ref name="Media Preservation Initiative"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~libarchm/index.php/projects/media-preservation-initiative.html|title=MPI|publisher=Indiana University Archive of Traditional Music|accessdate=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the recommendations of the planning document, Indiana University President Michael McRobbie announced a 15 million dollar commitment to the preservation of audio and video recordings on the Bloomington campus.  The resulting endeavor was renamed the Media Preservation and Digitization Initiative (MDPI) which formed a partnership with Memnon Archiving Services to digitally preserve 280,000 audio and video recordings by 2020.&lt;ref name="Media Digitization and Preservation Initiative"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mdpi.iu.edu/index.php |title=MDPI|publisher=Media and Digitization and Preservation Initiative |accessdate=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, 12,000 films from Indiana University's Moving Image Archives and other campus collections, including the Archives of Traditional Music were added to the efforts of MDPI. As the largest holder of unique and rare audiovisual recordings at Indiana University, nearly all of the archives' 100,000 recordings will be digitized by 2020 through this initiative. MDPI was the first – and as of 2018 the only – university-based media preservation effort in the United States on this scale.

==Projects==

===Archive of Historical and Ethnographic Yiddish Memories===
The AHEYM Project has collected nearly 400 interviews related to Jewish life before, during, and after World War II. Conducted primarily in Yiddish, the interviewees come from small towns throughout Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia. The current online exhibit cover daily life, foodways, Jewish life between the wars, religion, World War II and the Holocaust, and Jewish life after World War II. The archive can be explored by location, person, or subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iub.edu/~aheym/index.php|title=AHEYM - The Archives of Historical and Ethnographic Yiddish Memories - Home - Indiana University|website=www.iub.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preservation and cataloging of AHEYM Project recordings was funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities.

===Ethnographic Video for Instruction and Analysis (EVIA) Digital Archive===
The EVIA Digital Archive is a project created to host a digital archive of ethnographic videos for educational use. The projected originated from a collaboration between Indiana University and University of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eviada.webhost.iu.edu/Scripts/default.cfm|title=EVIA Digital Archive Project|publisher=Ethnographic Video for Instruction and Analysis (EVIA) Digital Archive|accessdate=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnomusicology Multimedia===
EM publishes books and supplemental audiovisual material on [[Ethnomusicology]] in order to aid scholars in research. EM offers access to Annotation Management System (AMS), which allows authors to upload audiovisual material and link it to content in their text. EM is a joint project between Indiana   and Temple Universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ethnomultimedia.org/about.html|title=About Ethnomusicology Online|website=ethnomultimedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hoagy Carmichael Online===
The [[Hoagy Carmichael]] Project at [[Indiana University]] was a project funded by IMLS between 1999 and 2000 to digitize and preserve the extensive collection of items related to Hoagy Carmichael that are housed at Indiana University. This early digital collection website aimed to present in its entirety the complete Carmichael collection. The collection contains sound recordings, letters, photographs, lyric sheets, correspondence, as well as personal effects.  It offers a biography and a virtual tour of the Carmichael Room located at the Archives of Traditional Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/collections/hoagy/intro/collec_over/|title=Overview of the Hoagy Carmichael Collection|website=www.dlib.indiana.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberian Collections Project===
The Liberian Collection was established in 2002. The Archives of Traditional Music is home to the audiovisual part of the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.libraries.indiana.edu/africanstudies/liberia|title=Library Research Guides: African Studies Research Guide: Liberian Collections|first=Mireille|last=Djenno|website=guides.libraries.indiana.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound Directions===
The Sound Directions Project was a joint project between Indiana University’s Archives of Traditional Music and Harvard University’s Archive of World Music  and funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities between 2005 and 2011. Phase 1 consisted of testing and determining the best practices and workflows for digital audio preservation. The following two phases focused on the preservation of archive holdings and on the development of software tools for media assessment and technical metadata collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/projects/sounddirections/|title=Sound Directions: Digital Audio Preservation and Access for Global Audio Heritage|website=www.dlib.indiana.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For description of the work see: Martin-Dubost (1997), p. 73, which says: "Ganesha getting ready to throw his lotus. Basohli miniature, circa 1730. National Museum, New Delhi. Attired in an orange dhoti, his body is enitirely red.  On the three points of his tiny crown, budding lotuses have been fixed. {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} holds in his two right hands the rosary and a cup filled with three modakas (a fourth substituted by the curving trunk is just about to be tasted). In his two left hands, {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}} holds a large lotus above and an axe below, with its handle leaning against his shoulder.

== History ==
[[File:Raja Amrit Pal (Reigned 1757-1776) of Basohli LACMA M.80.223.1.jpg|thumb|Raja Amrit Pal (Reigned 1757-1776) of Basohli]]
Immortalised by its artistic eminences and its connoisseur patrons, Basohli today is a metaphor for a vigorous, bold and imaginative artistic style, rich, stylish and unconventional. A style of painting characterized by vigorous use of primary colours and a peculiar facial formula prevailed in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries in the foothills of the Western [[Himalayas]] in the [[Jammu]] and [[Punjab region|Punjab]] States. The earliest paintings in this style have been dated to the time of [[Raja Kirpal Pal]] (1678–93).A Battle was fought at Basoli, it was called as the [[Battle of Basoli]] between [[Sikhs]] and [[Mughal Empire]] in 1702.&lt;ref name="CS"&gt;A Review of Basohli Style in Indian Painting, Chandramani Singh, Kailash - Journal of Himalayan Studies vol 2, Number 1&amp;2, 1974 [http://www.thdl.org/texts/reprints/kailash/kailash_02_0102_reviews.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Originating in [[Basohli State]], the style spread to the Hill States of [[Mankot]], [[Nurpur State|Nurpur]], [[Kullu|Kulu]], [[Mandi State|Mandi]], [[Suket State|Suket]], [[Bilaspur (princely state)|Bilaspur]], [[Nalagarh State|Nalagarh]], [[Chamba State|Chamba]], [[Guler State|Guler]] and [[Kangra State|Kangra]]. The first mention of Basohli painting is in the annual report of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] for the year published in 1921. Referring to the acquisitions of the Archaeological Section of the [[Lahore Museum|Central Museum]], [[Lahore]], the report states that "a series of old paintings of the Basohli School were purchased, and the Curator concludes that the Basohli Schools is possibly of pre-[[Moghul]] origin, and so called Tibeti pictures are nothing but late productions of this school".

'''''Belles on Their Toes''''' is a 1950 autobiographical book written by the siblings [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Jr.]] and [[Ernestine Gilbreth Carey]]. It is the follow-up to their book ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen]]'' (1948), which covered the period before [[Frank Gilbreth|Frank Gilbreth, Sr.]] died. It was adapted as a [[Belles on Their Toes (film)|film in 1952]].

==Title==
The title alludes both to a line in the [[nursery rhyme]] "[[Ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross]]" (i.e., "Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes") and to the marriages of the Gilbreth sisters:  "It was apparent that in order to get rings on their fingers, belles would have to be on their toes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gilbreth, Frank Bunker, Jr. |author2=Carey, Ernestine Gilbreth |last-author-amp=yes |title=Belles on Their Toes |date=1948 |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''Belles on Their Toes'' was written about the Gilbreth family after [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth]], Sr.'s death, and how they survived as their mother, [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth]], continued the pioneering work in [[industrial engineering]], [[time and motion studies]], and industrial/organizational psychology she had shared with her husband. This book is also the first place where the absence of the second oldest child, Mary Gilbreth, is explained; she died of [[diphtheria]] in 1912, at age five.

==Film adaptation==
''[[Belles on Their Toes (film)|Belles on Their Toes]]'' was made into a 1952 motion picture starring [[Myrna Loy]] as Lillian Gilbreth.

'''Bishapur''' ([[Middle Persian]]: ''Bay-Šāpūr''; {{lang-fa|بیشاپور|}}, ''Bishâpûr'') was an ancient city in [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanid Persia]] ([[Iran]]) on the ancient road between [[Persis]] and [[Elam]]. The road linked the [[Sassanid]] capitals [[Estakhr]] (very close to [[Persepolis]]) and [[Ctesiphon]]. It is located south of modern [[Faliyan]] in the [[Kazerun County]] of [[Pars Province]], [[Iran]].

Bishapur was built near a river crossing and at the same site there is also a fort with rock-cut reservoirs and a river valley with six Sassanid [[rock relief]]s.

The most important point about this city, is the combination of Persian and Roman art and architecture that hadn't been seen before Bishapur construction. Before Bishapour was built, almost all the main cities in Persia/Iran had a circular shape like the old city in [[Firuzabad, Fars|Firuzabad]] or [[Darab]].  Bishapour is the first city with vertical and horizontal streets also in the city specially in interior design we can see tile work that's adapted from [[Roman art|Roman Art]]  

== History ==
[[File:Bishapour palais Shapur.jpg|thumb|450px|upright|Ruins of Shapour Palace in Bishapur]]
[[File:Bishapur by Eugène Flandin.jpg|thumb|450px|upright|Bishapur in 1840; a painting by [[Eugène Flandin]] in the book "Travel in Persia" (''Voyage en Perse'')]]
[[File:Bishapour jarres.jpg|thumb|450px|upright|Jarres discovered in Bishapur]]

The name ''Bishapur'' derives from ''Bay-Šāpūr'', which means ''Lord Shapur''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bisapur-town&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an inscription, the city itself was founded in 266 AD by [[Shapur I]] (241-272), who was the second Sassanid king and inflicted a triple defeat on the Romans, having killed [[Gordian III]], captured [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] and forced [[Philip the Arab]] to surrender. In his native province of [[Fars Province|Fars]], he built a new capital that would measure up to his ambitions: Bishapur, ''Shapur's City''. Outside the city, Shapur decorated the sides of the Bishapur River gorge with huge historical relief commemorating his triple triumph over Rome. One of these reliefs, in a semicircular shape, has rows of registers with files of soldiers and horses, in a deliberate imitation of the narrative scenes on the [[Trajan]] column in Rome. 

At Bishapur the king also inaugurated the Sassanid imagery of the king's investiture, which would be copied by his successors: the king and the god are face to face, often on horseback, and the god - usually [[Ahura Mazda]] - is holding the royal diadem out to the sovereign.

The city, has the remarkable [[Band-e Kaisar|dam bridge in Shushtar]], built by [[Roman Empire|Roman]] soldiers who had been captured after [[Battle of Edessa|Valerian's defeat]] in 260. However, it was not a completely new settlement: archaeologists have found remains from the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Elamite Kingdom|Elamite]] ages.

The city remained important until the [[Arab conquest of Persia]] the rise of Islam in the second quarter of the 7th century AD. There were still people living there in the 10th century.

The city has a rectangular plan with a grid pattern of regular intra urban streets, resembling [[Ancient_Roman_architecture#City_design|Roman city design]]. This design was never repeated in the [[architecture of Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salma |first1=K. Jayyusi|last2=Holod|first2=Renata|last3=Petruccioli|first3=Attilio|last4=André|first4=Raymond|title=The City in the Islamic World|date=2008|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9789004162402|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excavations and Research==
The site was cleared by the Russian-French archaeologist [[Roman Ghirshman]] in the 1930s. The British archaeologist [[Georgina Herrmann]] has also written a book about the Sasanian rock reliefs in Bishapur which was published in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcat.org/title/sasanian-rock-reliefs-at-bishapur-part-1-bishapur-iii-triumph-attributed-to-shapur-i/oclc/59815517&amp;referer=brief_results&lt;/ref&gt;

== Decoration ==
[[File:Mosaic01.jpg|thumb|450px|upright|Persian-Roman floor mosaic detail from the palace of [[Shapur I]] at Bishapur. Now this tile work is in [[National Museum of Iran]]]]
The main part of the excavations took place in the royal sector, in the east of the city. A water temple, interpreted as a  [[Anahita|Anahita temple]] , was erected near the palace. In the center there is a cross-shaped space with eight large square exedrae decorated with 64 alcoves. The French excavators believed it had been covered with a dome roof, but this reconstruction has been rejected. To the west lies a courtyard decorated with mosaics; to the east, a square iwan used as a reception room. Its walls must have been covered with small stucco ornaments: rows of medallions, bands of foliage, and topped with merlons inherited from Achaemenid architecture. All these decorative techniques were still used after the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]].

The floor was paved with black marble slabs, with a mosaic border. Along the walls runs a narrow band featuring a series of heads and masks, in a frontal or profile view, on a white background. At the top of each alcove there was a picture of women naked under their transparent veils: courtesans, musicians, dancers, women twisting garlands, together with a few richly attired noble ladies.

The '''Center for Copyright Information''' ('''CCI''') is an American organization focused on advocacy and initiatives in support of copyright law. The CCI aims to educate the public about [[copyright]] law; coordinates with copyright owners and [[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) about issues related to online [[copyright infringement]]; assists with the design, implementation, review, and promotion of an online infringement notification and mitigation system (the [[Copyright Alert System]]); collects and disseminates online infringement data; and promotes lawful means of obtaining copyrighted works.&lt;ref name=MOU&gt;[http://www.copyrightinformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Memorandum-of-Understanding.pdf Memorandum of Understanding]; [http://www.copyrightinformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CCI-MOU-First-Amendment.pdf Aug. 2011 amendment]; [http://www.copyrightinformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CCI-MOU-Second-Amendment.pdf Oct. 2012 amendment].&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was created as a partnership between industry associations, including the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], and five major American Internet service providers.

==Background==
The Center for Copyright Information was formed in September 2011 to coordinate efforts between the television, film and music industries and service providers to curb online [[copyright infringement]] and educate Internet subscribers about the issue.&lt;ref name=CCIRelease&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/press-release/center-for-copyright-information-announces-three-major-steps-towards-implementation/ |title=Center for Copyright Information Announces Three Major Steps Towards Implementation |date= April 2012 |work=www.copyrightinformation.org |publisher=Center for Copyright Information |accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RIAA began negotiations to create the Center for Copyright Information and its Copyright Alert System in December 2008, after it ceased a five-year litigation campaign against individual file sharers.&lt;ref name=Kravets11&gt;{{cite news |title=ISPs to Disrupt Internet Access of Copyright Scofflaws |first=David |last=Kravets |url= https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/07/disrupting-internet-access/ |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=7 July 2011 |accessdate= 20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2003 and 2008, the RIAA adopted a practice of suing individual file sharers; previously it had focused on efforts to shut down [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] services.&lt;ref name=Kravets10&gt;{{cite news |title=Copyright Lawsuits Plummet in Aftermath of RIAA Campaign |first=David |last=Kravets |url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/05/riaa-bump/ |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate= 20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MPAA and RIAA, along with the [[Independent Film &amp; Television Alliance]] and [[American Association of Independent Music]], as associations representing independent producers in their fields, reached an agreement in July 2011 with five large ISPs to create the Copyright Alerts System.&lt;ref name=Kravets11/&gt; The trade groups argued copyright infringement was costing the U.S. economy hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in lost earnings and tax revenue annually.&lt;ref name=Richwine11&gt;{{cite news |title=Internet providers to act against online pirates |first=Lisa |last=Richwine |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/07/us-internet-piracy-idUSTRE7667FL20110707 |work=[[Reuters]] |date=7 July 2011 |accessdate= 20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] helped bring parties to the table as part of his 2008 work with Internet service providers to block access to online [[child pornography]].&lt;ref name=Sisario11&gt;{{cite news |title=To Slow Piracy, Internet Providers Ready Penalties |first=Ben |last=Sisario |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/08/technology/to-slow-piracy-internet-providers-ready-penalties.html?_r=0 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=7 July 2011 |accessdate= 3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the July 2011 agreement, several U.S. Internet service providers, including [[Verizon Communications]], [[Comcast]], [[Time Warner Cable]], [[Cablevision Systems]] and [[AT&amp;T]] agreed to send alerts to customers who appeared to be using their accounts for illegal downloading.&lt;ref name=Richwine11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;{{cite news |title=AT&amp;T Joins Verizon in Fighting Web Piracy of Movies, Music |first=Eric |last=Engelman |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-07/at-t-joins-verizon-in-fight-against-web-piracy-of-movies-music.html |work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=7 July 2011 |accessdate= 20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the agreement 75% of all broadband internet usage was provided by one of these five companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ernesto|title=HAS YOUR ISP JOINED THE US "SIX STRIKES" ANTI-PIRACY SCHEME?|url=http://torrentfreak.com/isp-six-strikes-anti-piracy-scheme-120803/|publisher=Torrent Freak|accessdate=6 March 2014|date=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;    The Memorandum of Understanding established that copyright holders and ISP’s would split the costs of the system 50/50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ernesto|title="SIX STRIKES"COPYRIGHT ALERT SYSTEM COSTS MILLIONS|url=http://torrentfreak.com/six-strikescopyright-alert-system-costs-millions-131017/|publisher=Torrent Freak|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   According to the CCI’s first tax filing, chronicling the first 8 months of the companies operations, CSA operation costs were $1,377,633.00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Center For Copyright Information Tax Return 2011|url=https://bulk.resource.org/irs.gov/eo/2013_06_EO/45-3366529_990O_201206.pdf|work=IRS Form 2011|accessdate=6 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307010426/https://bulk.resource.org/irs.gov/eo/2013_06_EO/45-3366529_990O_201206.pdf#|archive-date=2014-03-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2011, the [[Obama administration]] praised the formation of the CCI on the official [[White House Blog]] as "a positive step” and consistent with the executive branch’s strategy of encouraging voluntary intellectual property enforcement.&lt;ref name=WhiteHouse&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/07/07/working-together-stop-internet-piracy  |title=Working Together to Stop Internet Piracy |author=Victoria Espinel |date=7 July 2011 |work=www.whitehouse.gov |publisher=The White House |accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the CCI had its corporate status revoked according to the Columbia Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs for failing to file the proper paperwork, which they quickly resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sam|title=US Center for Copyright Information Lost Its Title|url=http://extratorrent.cc/article/2950/us+center+for+copyright+information+lost+its+title.html|publisher=Extra Torrent|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2013, the CCI announced it would be supporting iKeepSafe’s pilot program. iKeepSafe, is an independently created curriculum designed to educate children about copyright law and fair use in the digital age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mann|first=Colin|title=Six strikes’ effective in piracy fight|url=http://advanced-television.com/2014/02/26/six-strikes-effective-in-piracy-fight/|publisher=Advanced Television|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership and advisors===
CCI is led by an executive committee, with Executive Director Jill Lesser as its head. Lesser was previously the senior vice president of domestic public policy for [[AOL]], as well as the deputy director of public policy at [[People for the American Way]].&lt;ref name=CCIAbout&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/about-cci/ |title=About the Center for Copyright Information |work=www.copyrightinformation.org |publisher=Center for Copyright Information |accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the CCI has an advisory board which "consults actively on issues the Executive Committee is considering."&lt;ref name=CCIAbout /&gt; The CCI's original advisory board includes consumer advocates Jerry Berman, founder of the [[Center for Democracy and Technology]]; [[Gigi Sohn]], president and CEO of [[Public Knowledge]]; and Jules Polonetsky, director and co-chair of the [[Future of Privacy Forum]].&lt;ref name=CCIAbout /&gt;&lt;ref name=Masnick12&gt;{{cite news |last=Masnick |first=Mike |title=Organization Overseeing Six Strikes Agreement Between Labels And ISPs Includes Advisory Board To Try To Keep Tech Folks Happy |url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120402/18015918339/organization-overseeing-six-strikes-agreement-between-labels-isps-includes-advisory-board-to-try-to-keep-tech-folks-happy.shtml  |date=2 April 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leslie Harris, former President of the Center of Democracy and Technology replaced  Gigi Sohn when she was asked by the Chairman of Federal Communication’s Commission, Tom Wheeler, to run the FCC’s External Affairs branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tummarello|first=Kate|title='Six strikes' thwarting piracy, leader says|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/199124-six-strikes-thwarting-piracy-leader-says|publisher=The Hill|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright Alert System==

{{Main|Copyright Alert System}}

The '''Centre for Research and Restoration of the Museums of France''' ('''C2RMF''', ''Centre de recherche et de restauration des musées de France'') is the national [[Research institute|research centre]] in [[France]] responsible for the [[Documentation (field)|documentation]], [[Art conservation and restoration|conservation and restoration]] of the items held in the collections of more than 1,200 [[museum]]s across France. C2RMF also carries out extensive scientific studies and data recording for these collections, and is active both nationally and internationally in the field of [[cultural heritage]] conservation and analysis. The C2RMF is involved in the development of technologies and scientific procedures employed in the preservation of art works and artefacts, both on its own and in partnership with other museums and research institutions across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;Pillay ''et al.'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The centre was established in 1998 by an ''arrêté'' (administrative decision) issued by [[Catherine Trautmann]], the then [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture and Communications]], which was gazetted in the ''Journal Officiel'' on December 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1998-12-30 |title=Arrêté du 16 décembre 1998 érigeant divers services de la direction des musées de France en services à compétence nationale |url=http://admi.net/jo/1998/19955.html |journal=[[Journal Officiel de la République Française]] |issue=302 |page=19955 |id=NOR: MCCB9800657A |accessdate=2008-04-22|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created by merging the functions and facilities of two other research bodies, the [[Laboratoire de recherche des musées de France]] (LRMF, ''Research Laboratory of the Museums of France'') and the [[Service de restauration des musées de France]] (SRMF, ''Restoration Service of the Museums of France'') and it is organized in 4 departments. Today the center is affiliated to the [[CNRS]] with the label UMR-171.

In 2005 Mme. [[Christiane Naffah]] was appointed director of the centre by the French Minister of Culture and Communications [[Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres]], replacing Jean-Pierre Mohen. Naffah had been a [[curator]] in France's [[national museum]]s since 1977, and prior to her appointment had held positions at the [[Louvre]], [[Musée du Quai Branly]] and had been director of the [[Institut du monde arabe|Musée de l'institut du monde arabe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=[[Minister of Culture (France)|Ministère de la Culture et de la Communication]] |date=2005-07-27|title=Christiane Naffah est nommée directrice du Centre de recherche et de restauration des musées de France |url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/actualites/communiq/donnedieu/c2rmf.html |accessdate=2008-04-22|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The actual director is Mme. [[Marie Lavandier]].

Since the early 1930s, over 174,000 paintings and 34,000 objects have been individually studied or restored by the C2RMF, and its predecessor organisations LRMF and SRMF.&lt;ref&gt;Lahanier (2004, p.158)&lt;/ref&gt;

The C2RMF's key activities focus on the study of works of art at both a national and regional level. It undertakes investigations prior to any acquisition. Equipped with world-class experimental facilities that are constantly being improved, like the [[particle accelerator]] [[Accélérateur Grand Louvre d'analyse élémentaire|AGLAE]], the C2RMF focuses its research on several key areas: the physical
and chemical characteristics of materials, the ageing of materials, database management, image analysis, digitisation and 3D modelling. The C2RMF is one of the most experienced centres in the world in the use of scientific techniques on art works. They have an unparalleled knowledge and experience of the current state-of-the-art in the practical capture of 3D data from many different types of artefact. The latest research has concerned the multispectral imaging of paintings,&lt;ref&gt;Colantoni ''et al.'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; ontologies and the semantic web and the 3D modelling of objects and paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Pitzalis ''et al.'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it has achieved significant results with an Open Source database management system that provides multilingual access (17 languages) to specialised vocabularies for the cultural museum sector and a semantic interface to browse the results.

The '''Devonshire Hunting Tapestries''' are a group of four magnificent [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[tapestry|tapestries]] dating from the mid-fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Devonshire Hunting Tapestries|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/d/devonshire-hunting-tapestries/|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These enormous works, each over 3 metres wide, depict men and women in [[1400-1500 in fashion|fashionable dress of the early fifteenth century]] [[hunting]] in a [[forest]]. The tapestries formerly belonged to the [[Dukes of Devonshire]], but in 1957 were accepted by HM Government in lieu of tax payable on the estate of the [[10th Duke of Devonshire]] and allocated to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], where they remain. 

The [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th Duke]] described using his 'spare' tapestry to insulate the [[Long gallery|Long Gallery]] at [[Hardwick Hall]] in the 1840s, a practice which saved these rare Gothic hangings from being discarded. The tapestries depict a ''Deer Hunt'', ''Falconry'', a ''Swan and Otter Hunt'' and a ''Boar and Bear Hunt''. The hunt was a particularly powerful theme and would have been a familiar pastime to many of the high-born individuals and families who owned tapestries. Hunting was both a stylized sport and an important source of the only meats considered noble.

This detail is from the ''Boar and Bear Hunt'' Tapestry, made in the 1420s, and shows men carrying special [[boar-spear]]s, which have cross-bars designed to stop the charge of the boar and keep its deadly [[tusk]]s at arms length. Much of the charm of these scenes lies in the elaborate costume detail. The lady crossing the stream on the lower right has 'Monte le Desire' inscribed on her flowing sleeve. This is the opening line of a popular song of the period. The practice of embellishing one's clothes with such words was a medieval equivalent of having a stylish slogan printed on a T-shirt except that, in the tapestry, weaving on a horizontal [[loom]] has reversed the letters.

The dress of the participants is of the type worn at court, particularly that of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], which had control of the tapestry-weaving areas in the [[Burgundian Netherlands|southern Netherlands]]. It is unlikely that any serious hunting took place in such restricting and exotic clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Anna|title=V&amp;A: A Hundred Highlights.|year=2001|publisher=V&amp;A Publications|isbn=1-85177-365-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 500 meters east-northeast of the [[Sancaktar Hayrettin Mosque]], another Byzantine building.  The ruins of the edifice are enclosed in the complex of [[Cerrahpaşa University Hospital]].

==History==
===Byzantine Age===
The origin of this Byzantine building, which lay on the southern slope of the [[Seven hills of Istanbul|seventh hill]] of [[Constantinople]] in the neighborhood named ''ta Dalmatou'' and overlooked the [[Sea of Marmara]], is not certain. It was erected along the south branch of the ''[[Mese (Constantinople)|Mese]]'' road, just inside the now disappeared [[Walls_of_constantinople#Wall_of_Constantine|Wall of Constantine]] (dating to the foundation of Constantinople by [[Constantine the Great]]) in correspondence of [[Walls_of_Constantinople#Gates_2|an ancient gate]], possibly the Gate of Exakiónios ({{lang-gr|Πύλη τοῦ Ἐξακιονίου}}) or the Gate of [[Saturninus (consul 383)|Saturninus]] ({{lang-gr|Πύλη τοῦ Σατουρνίνου}}, the city's original [[Golden Gate (Constantinople)|Golden Gate]]). The comparison of the [[brickwork]] with those of the [[Pammakaristos Church|Pammakaristos]] and [[Chora Church|Chora]] churches suggests that the building was erected between the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of the fourteenth century, in the [[Palaiologan era]].&lt;ref name=mw118/&gt; The proposed identification with the Monastery of Iasités ({{lang-gr|Μονῆ τοῦ Ἰασίτου}}), which lay in the neighborhood, remains uncertain.&lt;ref name=ja264&gt;Janin (1953) p.264&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman Age===
[[File:Temenos tis pylis tou Iisou.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The mosque in a drawing of 1877, from A.G. Paspates' ''Byzantine topographical studies'']]
After the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottomans]] in 1453, in 1509 the Gate which gave the Turkish name to the building, ("Isa Kapi", gate of Jesus) was destroyed by an [[1509 Istanbul earthquake|earthquake]].&lt;ref name=mw118/&gt; Between 1551 and 1560 [[Vizier]] [[Hadim Ibrahim Pasha]] (d. 1562/63)&amp;nbsp;– who endowed also in the nearby neighborhood of the Gate of Silivri ({{lang-tr|Silivrikapi}}) [[Hadim Ibrahim Pasha Mosque|a Friday mosque bearing his name]]&amp;nbsp;– converted the building into a small mosque ({{lang-tr|Mescit}}). At the same time he let Court Architect&lt;!-- ({{lang-tr|Mimar}}) --&gt; [[Mimar Sinan]] (who also designed the Friday Mosque) enlarge the existing complex. Sinan built a [[Medrese]] (Koranic school) and a Dershane (elementary school) connecting them to the ancient church.&lt;ref name=ne392&gt;Necipoĝlu (2005), p.392&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ey90&gt;Eyice (1955), p.90&lt;/ref&gt;  The location of these religious establishments in sparsely settled neighborhoods along the city's [[Theodosian Walls]], where the population was predominantly Christian, shows the Vizier's desire of pursuing a policy of [[islamization]] of the city.&lt;ref name=ne392/&gt; During the seventeenth century the complex was damaged several times by earthquakes, and restored in 1648.&lt;ref name=mw119&gt;Müller-Wiener (1977), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1741 Ahmet [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|Agha]]&amp;nbsp;– another chief eunuch (Ibrahim Pasha in the charter of his ''[[waqf]]'' had designated the current chief white eunuch of the [[Imperial Harem]] as administrator ({{lang-tr|Mütevelli}}) &lt;ref name=bo146&gt;Boyar &amp; Fleet (2010), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; of the endowment)&lt;ref name=ne392/&gt;&amp;nbsp;– sponsored the construction of a small fountain ({{lang-tr|[[Sebil]]}}).&lt;ref name=ey90&gt;Eyice (1955), p.90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mw119/&gt; The [[1894 Istanbul earthquake]] ruined the building (only two walls withstood the quake), which was then abandoned.&lt;ref name=mw119/&gt; The ruins are now enclosed in the garden of Cerrahpaşa Hospital, seat of the Faculty of Medicine of [[Istanbul University]].

==Description==
The edifice had a rectangular plan with sides of 17.0 m and 6.80 m,&lt;ref name=mw119/&gt; and had one [[nave]] which ended towards East with a [[Bema]] and a three [[apse]]s.&lt;ref name=ma302&gt;Mamboury (1953) p.302&lt;/ref&gt; The central apse was demolished during the Ottoman period and replaced with a wall. The edifice's  [[brickwork]] consisted of courses of rows of white stones alternating with rows of red [[brick]]s,&lt;ref name=mw119/&gt; obtaining a chromatic effect typical of the late Byzantine period. The external side of a surviving wall is divided with [[Lesene]]s surmounted by arches.&lt;ref name=mw119/&gt; Most likely the church was originally surmounted by a dome, but in the nineteenth century this had already been replaced with a wooden roof. The church interior was adorned with [[fresco]]es of the Palaiologan Age. Two of them&amp;nbsp;– painted in the south apse&amp;nbsp;– one depicting respectively the [[Archangel Michael]] (on the [[Conch (architecture)|Conch]]) and the [[Hypatius of Gangra|St. Hypatius]] (on the side wall), were still visible in 1930, but now have disappeared.&lt;ref name=mw118/&gt;&lt;ref name=ja264/&gt; On the two walls still standing are still visible decorations in [[stucco]].&lt;ref name=ey90/&gt;

Two sides of the court are occupied by a medrese ({{lang-en|Coranic school}}) with eleven Cells to lodge the students ({{lang-tr|hücre}}) and a dershane ({{lang-en|primary school}}).&lt;ref name=mw118/&gt;&lt;ref name=ey90/&gt; The tight space constraints (the complex was encroached by several roads) forced Sinan to adopt a plan which strongly diverts from the standard solution for a complex of this kind.&lt;ref name=mw119/&gt; The brickwork of the medrese adopts a bichromatic pattern similar to that used in the church. The dershane is decorated with a [[frieze]] made of stucco arabesques in relief.&lt;ref name=ey90/&gt; The entrance of the court is adorned with a small [[Sebil]].&lt;ref name=ey90/&gt;

The '''Flag of Devon''' is the [[flag]] of the [[England|English]] county of [[Devon]]. It is dedicated to [[Saint Petroc]],&lt;ref name=flag_inst&gt;
[{{Flag Institute| Devon}} The Flag Institute] &lt;!-- The flagid in this link may need to change to track Flag institute database changes --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a local saint with numerous dedications throughout Devon. It is notable for its creation through two web-based [[Opinion poll|poll]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-e-dev.html | title=Devon, England | work = Flags of the world | date =21 October 2011 | accessdate = 28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc_devon_flag&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/community_life/features/devon_flag.shtml | date = January 2005 | title = Flag celebrates Devon's heritage | publisher = BBC Devon website | accessdate = 25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The subject of a Devonian flag was raised by the county's contingent of scouts to the [[20th World Scout Jamboree]] in an interview on BBC Radio Devon in 2002. The scouts were unaware of a Devon flag and wondered if any of the listeners knew of a flag for the county. BBC Radio Devon took up the search for a flag for Devon and asked the public to send in designs.

The flag was created in 2003 after a vote in two polls run by the BBC Devon website, the winning design taking 49% of the votes cast. The design was created by student Ryan Sealey.&lt;ref name=bbc_devon_flag/&gt;

The Devon Flag is made of three colours — green ([[Pantone]] 348), black and white.&lt;ref name=flag_inst/&gt; Although the flag is relatively young, its colours are those traditionally identified with Devon&lt;ref name=bbc_devon_flag/&gt; (e.g. the colours of its [[Rugby Union]] team, [[Exeter University]] and [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.]]). [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Lord Exmouth]] flew a dark green flag with white circles at the [[Bombardment of Algiers (1816)|Bombardment of Algiers]] (now on view at the Teign Valley Museum).{{cn|date=January 2014}} The green represents the colour of the rolling and lush Devon hills, the black represents the high and windswept moors ([[Dartmoor]] and [[Exmoor]]) and the white represents both the salt spray of Devon's two coastlines and the [[Kaolinite|China Clay]] industry (and mining in general).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/index/councildemocracy/neighbourhoods-villages/devonflag/devonflaggroup.htm | title = Devon Flag Group | work = Devon County Council website | accessdate = 4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its launch in 2003, the Devon Flag has gained popularity, and in October 2006 it gained "official" recognition when Devon County Council raised the flag outside County Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.devon.gov.uk/devonflag | title = Devon Flag | work = Devon County Council website | accessdate = 25 January 2014 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140201203703/http://www.devon.gov.uk/devonflag | archivedate = 1 February 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2004, Rodney Lock of [[Ottery St Mary]] in [[East Devon]] was threatened with legal action for flying the Devon flag in his back garden, as he required planning permission to fly non-national flags. Since then the Minister for Housing, [[Keith Hill (politician)|Keith Hill]], has said local authorities can officially "turn a blind eye" to the practice of flying the county flag from poles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/news_features/2004/flag_blind_eye.shtml| title= Council's told they can "turn a blind eye" to flag flying | date = December 2004 | publisher = BBC Devon website | accessdate = 25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Devon Ensign==

[[File:Devon Ensign.gif|thumb|Devon Ensign]]

First flown in 2003 the Devon Regatta Ensign ''(designed by Kevin Pyne)'' adds a [[Union Jack]] into the Canton of the Devon Flag - the flag is described as for use at Regatta, High Days &amp; Holidays, Weddings &amp; Burials at Sea. &lt;ref&gt;http://imperialflags.blogspot.co.uk/2007/06/isle-of-man.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-e-dev.html&lt;/ref&gt;




==Flying the Devon Flag==
The Devon Flag Group have suggested the following dates as days when it is appropriate for the Devon flag to be flown. Most of them are either the days of local events or the feast days of Devon's saints. It is also flown outside of these days, especially in rural towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.devon.gov.uk/index/councildemocracy/neighbourhoods-villages/devonflag/whentoflytheflag.htm | title = When to fly the flag | work = Devon County Council website | accessdate= 25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The creation of the flag drew criticism from [[Cornish nationalism|Cornish nationalists]], who accused it online of being an attempt to "hijack" their culture.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|title=New Flag Causes A Flap in South West| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/news_features/2003/flap_over_flag.shtml | publisher = BBC Devon website|accessdate=13 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bob Burns, who started the discussion over a flag for Devon, cited the visibility of the [[Saint Piran's Flag|Cornish Flag]] as one of his reasons "Devonians are only too aware of the ubiquitous Cornish Flag, which can often be seen in the form of car bumper stickers, on vehicles entering Devon from Cornwall."&lt;ref name=bbc_devon_flag/&gt;

Dr Mark Stoyle, a Devon historian, noted that "People are quite aware in Devon that the Cornish make political capital by claiming to be different." He also suggested that the new-found sense of Devonian identity was a backlash against incoming "city-dwellers settling in the South West".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The decision to dedicate the flag to St Petroc was not without controversy as the saint is equally popular in neighbouring Cornwall. But it was decided that as Devon's 27 church dedications to Saint Petroc far outweighs the 6 dedications in Cornwall, also the Devon villages named after him such as [[Petrockstowe]] and [[Newton St Petroc]], that the county had a strong claim to the saint and Cornwall had already selected [[Saint Piran]] as their patron saint many years previously.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2246">'''Fondation Vincent van Gogh Arles''' is a non-profit foundation located in [[Arles]] France dedicated to the work and legacy of [[Vincent Van Gogh]]. Its goal is to generate and promote cultural and artistic activities with reference to the oeuvre of Vincent van Gogh as related to the time he spent in Arles, and the intention that van Gogh expressed in establishing an international center of artistic creation and exchange in Arles. The artistic director is editor-in-chief of [[Parkett]], [[Bice Curiger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-vincentvangogh-arles.org/en/foundation/organization/team/ Fondation Vincent van Gogh. Team]. Retrieved 2 July 2017 &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1983 Yolande Clergue, a curator married to the photographer [[Lucien Clergue]], founded the Association for the Creation of the Fondation Van Gogh (subsequently known simply as the Fondation Van Gogh).
 
In 1985 Yolande Clergue proposed initiating a collection of works executed by contemporary artists in tribute to Van Gogh, including [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]]. Bacon responded enthusiastically by producing a painting specifically for the foundation. More than ninety artists chose to contribute to this homage to Vincent van Gogh.

In 2008 Yolande Clergue’s original ambition to create a Fondation Van Gogh was given new momentum by [[Luc Hoffmann]] who established a permanent framework for activities designed to preserve the memory of Van Gogh in Arles and to foster [[contemporary art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-vincentvangogh-arles.org/en/foundation/presentation/introduction/ Fondation Vincent van Gogh. History]. Retrieved 2 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt; This new foundation was officially established in 2010, under the name of the Fondation Vincent van Gogh Arles. It is now located in the Hôtel Léautaud de Donines.

In [[show business]], a '''guest appearance''' is the participation of an outsider performer (such as a [[musician]] or [[actor]]) in an event such as a [[music record]] or [[concert]], [[Performance|show]], etc., when the performer does not belong to the regular cast, band or other performing group. In music, such an outside performer is often referred to as a '''guest artist'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Dance Encyclopedia |first1= Anatole |last1= Chujoy |first2= Phyllis Winifred |last2= Manchester |year= 1967 |publisher= [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |page= 434 |chapter= Guest Artist}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[performance art]], the terms '''guest role''' or '''guest star''' are also common, the latter term specifically indicating the guest appearance of a [[celebrity]]. The latter is often also credited as '''special guest star''' or '''special musical guest star''' by some production companies. 

In [[pop music]], guest appearances are often described with the words '''featuring''', '''with''', or '''and'''. It is abbreviated in credit lists as '''feat.''', '''ft.''', '''f/''', or '''f.'''. 

In a [[television series]], a guest star is an actor who appears in one or a few episodes (sometimes an entire [[story arc]]). 

In [[radio]] and [[television shows]], a guest star is a guest on the show who is a celebrity.

==Classical performance arts==
Guest appearances have been known in [[theatre]], [[ballet]], and [[classical music]] for centuries, with guests both from the home country and from abroad. The advent of [[air transport]] has made this practice much more practical and global.&lt;ref name=laine&gt;{{cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03EFD9163BF935A15754C0A967948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title= The Ballet Star as Guest Artist |first= Barry |last= Laine |authorlink=Barry Laine |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= January 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In classical music, guest [[orchestra conductor]]s are a common practice.

Guest artists should not be confused with touring groups, troupes, orchestra, or even individual artists, although the distinction may be blurred. In the case of touring, their act is independent in itself, while the guest takes part in the act of the resident staff.

The duration of involvement of a guest artist may vary, from separate short-term acts with fees per concert to fixed temporary [[contract]]s for several seasons.

==Contemporary music==
&lt;!--This section is redirected to from [[Guest vocalist]].--&gt;
In the early days of the [[pop music]] industry the [[band (music)|band]]s were relatively stable units, and while guests were not uncommon, they were seldom given credits on album covers. For example, [[Eric Clapton]] was not credited in print for his guitar performance in the release of "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]" of [[the Beatles]]. Still the term "featuring" was used as early as in the July 1954 [[UK Singles Chart]] by "[[The Four Aces]] featuring [[Al Alberts]]" with "[[Three Coins in the Fountain (song)|Three Coins In The Fountain]]" at 5th place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.everyhit.com/ | title=UK Top 40 Hit Database | accessdate=July 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gradually guest appearances have become a fully credited staple of music industry. The custom of guest appearance has become especially prominent in [[rap music]], and this influenced [[rock music]]ians as well.&lt;ref name=aust&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22799180-16947,00.html |title= Voices Find Gilt by Association |first= Mark |last= Edwards |date= November 22, 2007 |work= [[The Australian]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To have a guest star on a record, the [[production coordinator]] must obtain permission from the [[record label]] of the guest and make sure that proper credits are delivered to the host record label to be printed on the album cover, often in the form "''Artist name'',  courtesy of ''Record Label name.''" The permission is not always granted and sometimes negotiations may take a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Bobby |last= Borg |year= 2003 |title= The Musician's Handbook: A Practical Guide to Understanding the Music Business |isbn= 0-8230-8357-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for guest appearances==
A common reason for guest appearances is to draw attention to an act by including a celebrity into it. And vice versa, in the fashion-driven environment of show industry, older stars keep themselves in the limelight by associating themselves with emerging stars.&lt;ref name=aust/&gt;

In rap, mutual and multiple guest starring was recognized as a way to diversify the performance.&lt;ref name=aust/&gt;

In theatre and ballet, guest appearances diversify actors' repertory and experience under different choreographers, and give more acting opportunities. Even for established stars prestigious overseas engagements increase their home status. Conversely, a guest star benefits the receiving troupe, bringing new inspiration and technique. Audience would welcome diversity, and theatrical business benefits as well: theatre connoisseurs will come to see the same piece with a new star.&lt;ref name=laine/&gt;

==Drawbacks==
Commercialization of guests policy may also have negative consequences. Local theatres may limit the growth opportunities for their performers in favor of guests. Sometimes rehearsal times are inadequate to fully integrate the home and guest styles. Touring increases physical load on an actor. It is also associated with multiple stress factors: from [[jet lag]]s to close calls due to unanticipated travel delays.&lt;ref name=aust/&gt;

With a television series, the appearance of a special guest star could mark the moment when a series "[[Jumping the shark|jumps the shark]]"; that is, a doomed attempt to reverse a decline in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work= Jump the Shark |title= Special Guest Star |url= http://www.jumptheshark.com/forum/Special-Guest-Star/30 |accessdate= October 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harlequin print''' is a repeating pattern of contrasting diamonds or elongated squares standing on end.

== Origins ==
A harlequin is character from [[Commedia dell'arte]], a 16th-century Italian theater movement. Harlequins were witty, mischievous clowns.  Their early costumes were sewn together from fabric scraps.  Over time, the diamond pattern became associated with harlequins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7NuCOmcUQ9IC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=harlequin+history+fashion#v=onepage&amp;q=harlequin&amp;f=false|title=Fashion: The Definitive History of Costume and Style|last=DK|date=2012-10-01|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781465407801|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1949–1950s==
Harlequin fabric was popularized in 1944 when [[Adele Simpson]] presented the harlequin print in a bold diamond design on the town suits she created. It was also featured in green and white with a green jacket and a black skirt.&lt;ref&gt;"Designer Studies Small-Town Needs", ''[[New York Times]]'', January 30, 1944, pg.  36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1949, [[Louella Ballerino]] employed a harlequin print motif in the [[jester blouse]] "sun and fun" fashions she made popular. The design appeared along with pointed collars, tipped with buttons reminiscent of bells, and jagged points which sometimes adorned an apron overskirt.&lt;ref&gt;"California Styles Exhibited Before 400 At Breakfast", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', October 26, 1949, Pg. B1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1950, Fashion Frocks of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] marketed a white [[Piqué (weaving)|piqué]] dress, with an exaggerated side drape, in a red, white, and black harlequin print piqué, It was sold directly to homes by housewife representatives.&lt;ref&gt;"Fashion-Of-Week", ''[[Philadelphia Tribune]]'', August 29, 1950,  pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tammis Keefe]], a cloth designer whose patterns appeared at [[Lord and Taylor]] in September 1952, used a harlequin print diamond pattern on a large cloth she crafted for a table setting show.&lt;ref&gt;"Table Settings And Mats On View", ''New York Times'',  September 10, 1952, pg. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a July 1954 article in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', columnist Olga Curtis mentioned harlequin print fabrics and cellophane as very novel ideas in accessories.&lt;ref&gt;"'54 Decorator Ideas: Old Fashioned Accessories", ''Washington Post'', July 8, 1954,  pg. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

A sports costume In a harlequin print topped by bright orange received the most applause at a Simplicity Patterns Fashion Show at Sulzberger Junior High School, in March 1955. Presented by Norma Riseman, the orange wraparound blouse was one of many colorful fashions modeled for teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;"Sulzberger Previews Cute Spring Fashions", ''Philadelphia Tribune'', March 8, 1955, pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1955 a silk  dress at Peck &amp; Peck had white, pink, and blue tints of harlequin print. The colors and diamond motif were embellished when worn together with a white cashmere sweater highlighted by spangles.&lt;ref&gt;"Decorated Sweaters Keep in trim with the Dress", ''New York Times'', June 27, 1955,
pg. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freddie Mercury]] was very well known for performing in various concerts during the late seventies in harlequin print trousers. He also wore them in his music video "[[Living on My Own]]".

== 1960s ==
Harlequin print became particularly popular in the 1960s, appearing on underwear, umbrellas, pajamas, ski wear, maternity clothes, and hosiery. A 1962 Picasso retrospective in New York fueled the trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.fidmmuseum.org/museum/2015/10/fun-furs.html|title=Merry Pranksters|website=FIDM Museum Blog|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1990s and 2000s==

Beene and Rowley employed harlequin prints in their fashion designs presented at spring fashion week in November 1996.&lt;ref&gt;"New York designers say sheer styles will rule", ''Philadelphia Tribune'',  November 8, 1996, pg. 2C.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2001 Ebony Fashion Fair designer [[Oscar de la Renta]] presented a multicolored harlequin print silk [[charmeuse]] gown with a skirt fashioned with accordion pleats and a halter top with a gold neck ring.&lt;ref&gt;"New York", ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'', May 2001, pg. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

===Alcott, Louisa May===
(HFR)

Rather than ''[[Little Women]]'', set in a North that was winning the war, '''[[Louisa May Alcott]]''' wrote ''After the War was Lost''.

===Ballou, Charles===
(AE:VO)

'''[[Charles Clarendon Ballou]]''' is a [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the [[United States Army]], and the base commandant of [[Fort Leavenworth]] when Irving Morrell is posted there in the mid-1930's. It is Ballou who reintroduces [[colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Morrell to Brigadier General Daniel MacArthur, and who reassigns Morrell to be armor commander of MacArthur's occupying force in Houston.

===Baum, L. Frank===
(GW:AF, AE:VO)

In a rather odd move on Turtledove's part, '''[[L. Frank Baum]]''' is introduced as an American fighter pilot early in the Great War, this despite the fact that Baum was aged 58 in 1914. (Perhaps there is confusion with his son [[Frank Joslyn Baum]]) Somewhere along the line, Baum still becomes a children's author. Only his book ''[[Queen Zixi of Ix]]'' is mentioned by name, but because the book is an offshoot of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'' craze, we can assume he still wrote his most famous book. (However, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was inspired by [[architectural]] exhibits at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]] of 1893, which is unlikely to have happened in this timeline, making this plot element questionable.)

===Bernstein, Carl===
(SA:G)

Sergeant '''[[Carl Bernstein]]''' is in charge of a [[U.S. Army]] [[counterintelligence]] squadron that specializes in detecting [[wiretaps]]. He is sent to check [[Congresswoman]] Flora Blackford's office for bugs. Among his team are a 'Bob' (possibly [[Bob Woodward]] or [[H. R. Haldeman]]) and 'Dick' (almost certainly [[Richard Nixon]]). This is an obvious [[anachronism]] for the sake of a laugh, as the Bernstein of our timeline was not born until 1944.

===Blaine, James G.===
(HFR)

'''[[James G. Blaine]]''' was the second and last [[Republican Party (USA)|Republican]] [[president of the United States]]. He was also known as the only other president to start a war (over the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]]'s purchase of the states of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and [[Sonora]], giving the Confederacy a [[Pacific]] port) and to lose the war as well. At the end of The [[Second Mexican War]], Blaine started the U.S. tradition of Remembrance Day and also started the alliance with the [[German Empire]], which developed into The [[Central Powers]] of the Great War.

===Bogart, Humphrey===
(SA:DE)

In this timeline, '''[[Humphrey Bogart]]''' still became a movie actor. He starred in the movie ''The Maltese Elephant'', an analog to the main timeline's ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (''The Maltese Elephant'' is also the name of a short story in Harry Turtledove's short story collection ''[[Counting Up, Counting Down]]''). Armstrong Grimes thought of Bogart when he learned that his aunt Clara was marrying someone named Humphrey Baxter.

===Booth, John Wilkes===
(HFR)

With the South having gained its independence, '''[[John Wilkes Booth]]''' has nothing to be [[Lincoln assassination|homicidally angry]] about. He and his elder brother '''[[Edwin Booth]]''' remain popular stage actors in both the U.S. and [[Confederate States of America|CSA]] into the 1880s.

===Borah, William Edgar===
(AE:VO)

[[Herbert Hoover]]'s running mate (Hoover became president after president-elect [[Calvin Coolidge]] died and did not have a vice president) in the [[United States presidential election, 1936|1936 election]], '''[[William Edgar Borah]]''' had even some of the most loyal Democrats saying that his vice presidential opponent, [[Charles M. La Follette|Charles W. La Follette]], would make a better VP.

===Brown, Mordecai===
(GW:WH, AE:VO)

Known only as "Mordecai" in the series, '''[[Mordecai Brown|Mordecai "Three Finger" Brown]]''', instead of becoming a [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] pitcher, was a crewman on the ''[[United States Ship|USS]] Dakota'' during the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]]. [[Sam Carsten]] noted how Mordecai could work as if he had ten fingers, instead of eight, which was the result of a childhood accident (also suffered by the Brown of our timeline). By 1934, Mordecai was the foreman at a [[Los Angeles]] construction company; one of his employees was Chester Martin, who had moved from [[Toledo, Ohio]] as a result of the [[Great Depression|Business Collapse]]. By the late 1930s, however, Mordecai lost many of his workers, including Martin, as a result of a strike.

===Butler, Benjamin Franklin===
(HFR)

'''[[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Franklin Butler]]''' had been a politician of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] when the War of Secession began in 1861. He left the party and joined the [[United States Army|Army]] to fight the war. He was best known for commanding the occupation garrison of [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], a post in which he was most thoroughly despised by the locals. When the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] was defeated, Butler was forced to flee New Orleans for his life; the Confederate authorities had promised to hang him for war crimes without a trial. In the aftermath of the war, Butler left the army and returned to politics, this time joining the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] as a hard liner.

When the [[Second Mexican War]] began in 1881, Butler was more than enthusiastic to fight it, but as the war progressed and turned against the Union, Butler grew bitter and openly critical of US President [[James G. Blaine]].

In 1882, Butler was one of several prominent leaders of the Republican Party to attend a convention called by former president [[Abraham Lincoln]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. He resisted Lincoln's proposal to replace hostility toward the Confederate States with workers' rights as the central plank of the party's platform. Butler steadfastly refused to drop his Anti-Confederate policies. He blamed the loss of the war on the social and moral weakness of the country, and that it needed to rebuild itself into a more authoritarian nation if the nation was to ever be triumphant over the Rebels. When he realized he wasn't going to get his way, Butler walked out of the meeting. In the chaos that followed, the Republican Party split, with the Liberal faction joining the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]], while Butler left the Republican Party and rejoined the Democrats, taking all of the Conservative hardliners with him.

As a result of Butler's actions, the Democratic Party would be pushed further to the right on the political spectrum and would also cause a majority of the party to adopt a hard line foreign policy and the gearing of American society to [[American nationalism|nationalism]] and [[revanchism]].

===Cannon, Clarence===
(AE:VO)

A [[Socialist Party (USA)|Socialist]] Congressman from [[Missouri]], '''[[Clarence Cannon]]''' becomes [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] during the [[Alfred Emanuel Smith|Smith]] Administration.

===Chaney, Lon===
(SA:G)

'''[[Lon Chaney, Sr.]]''' appeared as a silent movie star in ''The Phantom of the Catacombs'', which is probably an analog of our timeline's ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]].''

===Clemens, Samuel===
(HFR, SA:DE)

'''[[Samuel Clemens]]''' does not become famous in this timeline as the novelist, travel writer, and essayist [[Mark Twain]]. Here he has lost his family's valuable land in [[Tennessee]] (as it is now part of an enemy nation).  He settles down with his family in [[San Francisco]] where he becomes the editor of the ''San Francisco Morning Call'',  and is known for his very sarcastic war editorials in the 1880s during the [[Second Mexican War]]. His home is burned by [[British army|British soldiers]] on their way to steal from the [[San Francisco Mint]], and he is briefly suspected of being an enemy agent until Colonel [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] meets with him and determines he is safe. His journalistic work keeps him occupied full-time and he never takes up writing books.

Clemens had a different wife and children in this world than he had in our timeline. Unlike our world, one of his offspring grew up to be a famous [[journalist]]: Ophelia Clemens. It was never revealed whatever happened to his other child, Orion.

===Coolidge, Calvin===
(AE:BI-AE:CCH)

'''[[Calvin Coolidge]]''' was the Democratic politician in the early 1900s. He served as the [[governor of Massachusetts]] in the 1910s and 20s, and was elected to the presidency in [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932]]. He holds the distinction of being the only man elected [[President of the United States]] never to be inaugurated.

A veteran of the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]], Coolidge rose to prominence during his tenure as the governor of Massachusetts during the 1920s. [[United States presidential election, 1928|In 1928, he was the Democratic Party's nominee for president]]. However, as the United States had been experiencing an economic boom under the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] President [[Upton Sinclair]], Coolidge was readily portrayed as another regressive Democrat. Despite Coolidge's promises to keep the [[Confederate States]] in check, his lack of accomplishment outside of [[Massachusetts]], worked against him. Although he carried all of the [[New England]] states (including his home and birth states of Massachusetts and [[Vermont]]), [[Kansas]], [[Kentucky]], [[Montana]], [[Idaho]], [[Nevada]], and [[Texas Panhandle|Houston]], he lost that election narrowly to the incumbent Vice President, Socialist [[Hosea Blackford]]. When Coolidge called Blackford to concede the race, he warned him that a "[[bull market]] going as high as it is, will fall". Blackford thought it was just [[:wikt:sour grapes|sour grapes]] and paid no heed. When Coolidge's words [[Stock Market Crash 1929|came true in 1929]] and the Socialists and Blackford were blamed for the crash, he was nominated on the Democratic ticket again in [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932]] with [[Herbert Hoover]] as his running mate. He won the 1932 election in a landslide. However, on January 5, 1933, President-elect Coolidge suffered a heart attack while shaving and died, less than a month before he would be inaugurated on February 1. (The Coolidge of our history died on the same date, but after he served as president from 1923 to 1929.) Herbert Hoover took his place as President-elect and would go on to be inaugurated as the thirty first [[President of the United States]] on February 1.

===Curley, Jim===
(SA:ID)

Congressman '''[[James Michael Curley|Jim Curley]]''' of [[Massachusetts]] was the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party's]] candidate for Vice President in the [[United States presidential election, 1944|1944 election]]. [[Flora Hamburger|Flora Hamburger Blackford]] questioned this choice because of his role in the [[Boston]] Socialist political machine, though she figured the [[Kansas City]] Democratic machine was more corrupt. The Socialist ticket of [[Charles M. La Follette|Charles W. La Follete]] and Curley lost to the Democratic ticket of [[Thomas E. Dewey]] and [[Harry S. Truman]].

===Custer, George Armstrong===
(HFR, GW:AF-AE:CCH)

In this timeline, '''[[George Custer]]''' was not [[Battle of Little Big Horn|killed fighting Indians in 1876]], as this smaller United States appears to have attempted to salve its wounded national pride following the [[War of Secession]] by unleashing a much larger [[US Army]] upon the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes, thus compressing the conquest of the Great Plains into a much shorter timescale. He served in [[Utah]] and [[Montana]] during the Second Mexican War, where he met [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. His forces helped defeat General [[Charles George Gordon|Charles Gordon]]'s invasion of [[Montana]].  A movement to nominate him to succeed [[James G. Blaine]] as [[US President]] flourished briefly but petered out. In the Great War he was a [[lieutenant general]] in the [[United States Army]] and commanded the First Army forces in [[Tennessee]]. He was personally vain, using peroxide to bleach his grey hair and mustache despite his advanced age. He was concerned about his public image, and was furious when he read the reports on him by [[journalist]] [[Richard Harding Davis]]. As a Great War commander, he was unsuited for [[trench warfare]], insisting on mounting large assaults on enemy lines instead of winning by attrition. However, his strategies were perfectly suited for "barrels," the timeline's term for [[tanks]]. Once they were introduced in force he crafted the "Barrel Roll Offensive," an armored breakthrough which ultimately won the Great War for the U.S.

Following the war, Custer was appointed to command the occupation forces in Canada, where he survived several [[assassination]] attempts, ultimately killing the man who had tried so determinedly to kill him. Custer was forced into retirement following the election of [[Upton Sinclair]] as President; Secretary of War [[Norman Mattoon Thomas]] served him the papers. He died in 1930 and was buried next to Theodore Roosevelt near [[Robert E. Lee]]'s house in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington, West Virginia]], in one of several northern [[Virginia]] counties reassigned to [[West Virginia]] after the Great War. His extraordinarily lengthy career, approximately 60 years in the [[US Army]], is roughly analogous to that of the German general [[Paul von Hindenburg]] in our timeline.

===Custer, Thomas===
(HFR)

'''[[Thomas Custer|Tom Custer]]''', in this timeline, was not killed in 1876 alongside his brother George at [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Little Big Horn]]. He fought alongside his brother during the Second Mexican War in both [[Utah]] and [[Montana]]. In 1881, Tom was killed during the fighting in Montana; this led to his brother George developing a lifelong hatred of the Canadians.

===Daniels, Josephus===
(GW:AF-GW:B)

Although being of Southern origins, '''[[Josephus Daniels]]''' served as Secretary of the [[U.S. Navy]] during the Great War. A destroyer escort was named after him in the Second Great War.

(It is unknown why he is on the USA's side, and it is commonly believed to be an error on the part of author Harry Turtledove. In actual history, Daniels was born in [[Washington, North Carolina]] to a Unionist family; his father was killed by Confederate artillery in January 1865.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncmarkers.com/Markers.aspx?ct=ddl&amp;sp=search&amp;k=Markers&amp;sv=B-24%20-%20JOSEPHUS%20DANIELS&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Southern Victory'' timeline, it may be presumed that the Daniels family moved North after the Union defeat in 1862.)

===Darrow, Clarence===
(AE:CCH)

With no Southern states to [[Scopes Trial|interfere with the teaching of evolution]], '''[[Clarence Darrow]]''' practiced [[criminal law]] in the United States. He was famous enough to convince the State of [[Kentucky]] (and the Kentucky State Police head Luther Bliss) that it was wrong in holding Cincinnatus Driver on trumped-up charges.

===Davis, Richard Harding===
(GW:AF-GW:WH)

'''[[Richard Harding Davis]]''' was a journalist and war correspondent in this timeline as well as ours. He was famous for coverage of the Hispano-Japanese War of 1905, and was a thorn in the side of General [[George Armstrong Custer]]. He died of a heart attack in 1916 observing the trench fighting in the Great War. (In our timeline, he died in the same year of the same cause, but in [[New York City]] instead of a war zone.)

===Debs, Eugene V.===
(GW:B-AE:BI)

Senator '''[[Eugene V. Debs]]''' was one of the first Socialists to be elected to Congress after the split of the Republican Party. He was the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] candidate for President in [[United States presidential election, 1908|1908]], [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912]] and [[United States presidential election, 1916|1916]]. He ran unsuccessfully for president against [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in both the 1912 and 1916, and was a strong opponent of U.S. involvement in the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]].

===Dewey, George===
(GW:AF)

'''[[George Dewey]]''' of [[Vermont]] is the admiral who commands the successful U.S. attack on the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] early the Great War, in 1914. There are passing similarities between this fictional battle and the real [[Battle of Manila Bay]].

Dewey may or may not have commanded the Navy during the Battle of the Three Navies—the commander is never named. If it is not Dewey, it is [[Bradley Fiske]], who evidently succeeded Dewey. It should be noted that Dewey would have been 77 at the time of the Battle, and Fiske was over a decade younger.

===Dewey, Thomas E.===
(SA:ID)

'''[[Thomas Dewey]]''' was governor of New York when he received the Democratic nomination for President in 1944. He and his running mate [[Harry S. Truman]] of [[Missouri]] defeat the incumbent [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Charles W. La Follette|Charles W. La Follette]]. His victory is partially attributed to pointing out that the CSA was able to regain strength and attack the United States on the watch of three Socialist Presidents (conveniently downplaying Democrat [[Herbert Hoover]], who made no efforts to stop the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]).

At his inauguration on February 1, 1945, President Dewey pledged to continue US occupation of the CS with the intention of re-integrating the southern states back into the Union, even though over 82 years had passed since the Confederate States had won its independence in the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]] (1861–1862) with the support of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[Second French Empire|France]]. He pledged to continue La Follette's policy of racial equality in the armed services. Furthermore, he proposed a continued partnership with the United States' traditional ally, the [[German Empire]], to police the world and prevent the spread of superbomb technology to their former enemies, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Given that it was widely believed that Dewey would lose the election, the front-page headline of the November 8, 1944 edition of the [[Chicago Tribune]] inaccurately read "[[Dewey Defeats Truman|La Follette Defeats Dewey]]". Vice President-elect Truman was photographed holding up a copy of the paper by the media. Dewey was elected at the age of 42, tying the first Socialist president Upton Sinclair (who was elected to the first of two terms in [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920]], defeating the Democratic incumbent [[Theodore Roosevelt]]) as the youngest president in US history. He also held the distinction of being the first president born in the 20th century whereas Sinclair was the first born after the War of Secession.

Dewey's victory might be intended to parallel [[Clement Attlee]]'s surprising landslide victory over [[Winston Churchill]] at the end of the Second World War in our timeline. His U.S.-German partnership is reminiscent of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[Four Policemen]] idea.

===Douglass, Frederick===
(HFR)

'''[[Frederick Douglass]]''' was still trying to tell the United States of the suffering of the [[African-American]] slaves in the Confederacy twenty years after the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]]. His pleas were heard only by the small minority of freedmen in the USA and a handful of whites. He also, ironically, becomes one of the first people (in his mind) to approve of the "Revenge" mindset that the United States picked up in the [[How Few Remain|Second Mexican War]] in fighting the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]].

===Fields, W.C.===
(SA:DE)

'''[[W.C. Fields]]''' still becomes a film comic, and retains his trademark line "All things considered, I'd rather be in [[Philadelphia]]," perhaps inspired by the city becoming the de facto capital of the U.S.

===Fiske, Bradley===
(GW:B)

'''[[Bradley Fiske]]''' is a rear admiral during the Great War. He is the force commander of the U.S. fleet that assists Chile in its war against Argentina in 1917. He appears briefly to congratulate Sam Carsten and Vic Crosetti for tipping off the military to [[Hawaii]]an spy John Liholiho.

===Foulke, William Dudley===
(HFR, GW:AF)

This American politician, lawyer, and poet appears at the beginning of ''How Few Remain''. Before the war starts '''[[William Dudley Foulke|William Foulke]]''' is an infantry captain of the United States Army. [[Jeb Stuart]] wonders what a stuck-up young man is doing out west. He reappears in 1915 as Irving Morrell's divisional commander in southeastern Kentucky.

===Foxx, Jimmie===
(SA:DE)

Instead of becoming a Hall of Fame first baseman, '''[[Jimmie Foxx]]''' was a running back in the U.S. football league. His name was used as a password in Irving Morrell's army to identify Confederate spies.

===Garfield, James===
(HFR)

Senator '''[[James Garfield]]''' is one of the Republican Party leaders who gather in [[Chicago]] in 1882 to discuss the party's future. He is more conservative than former president [[Abraham Lincoln]] and wishes not to make the party more radical.

===Gehrig, Lou===
(AE:CCH)

'''[[Lou Gehrig]]''' played professional football in this timeline as a member of the [[Philadelphia]] [[tanks|Barrels]] team. When asked about earning more money than [[US President]] [[Hosea Blackford]], he responded, "I had a better year than he did," echoing [[Babe Ruth]]'s comments about [[Herbert Hoover|President Hoover]] in our timeline.

===Goldwater, Barry===
(AE:VO)

'''[[Barry Goldwater]]''' was a Democratic Congressman from [[New Mexico]] noted for his [[anti-Mormon]] speeches and rabble rousing during the days and months leading up to Second Great War. (Note that the New Mexico of this timeline included [[Arizona]], home to our timeline's Goldwater.)

===Grant, Ulysses S.===
(HFR, AE:BI)

General '''[[Ulysses Grant]]''', in the twenty years after the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]], is a broken down, poor man. Known for his victories in a war the United States had few in, he was one of the few people left in the United States who supported the plight of [[African-Americans]] in both North American republics. Grant died from complications from [[alcoholism]].

===Greenberg, Hank===
(SA:DE)

Instead of becoming a Hall of Fame first baseman for the [[Detroit Tigers]], '''[[Hank Greenberg]]''' was a prominent U.S. running back. His name was used as a code in Irving Morrell's army to prevent Confederate spies from infiltrating U.S. lines.

===Guffey, Joseph===
(SA:RE)

'''[[Joseph F. Guffey]]''' was the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|U.S. Speaker of the House]] during the Smith and La Follette administrations. When [[Al Smith]] was killed in the Confederate bombing raid of Philadelphia in 1942, Guffey announced the President's death to a joint session of Congress.

===Halsey, William Frederick Jr.===
(SA:RE)

A Rear Admiral of the Southern Shore Squadron, '''[[Bill Halsey]]''' was part of the MacArthur plan to land and attack at the mouth of the [[James River]] until General Abner Dowling contacted the War Department to stop that plan. From Dowling's statement on him, it seems he is as reckless as MacArthur.

===Hamlin, Hannibal===
(HFR)

'''[[Hannibal Hamlin]]''' was [[Vice President of the United States]] under President [[Abraham Lincoln]] from 1861 to 1865. In the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 election]], and in the aftermath of the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]], he and Lincoln were defeated in a landslide. Hamlin would later serve as [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]] in the [[James G. Blaine]] administration and is chosen to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict leading up to the Second Mexican War, a task in which he was not successful.

In 1882, Hamlin was one of several prominent Republican leaders to attend a convention called by Lincoln at the Florence Hotel in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. He resisted Lincoln's proposal to replace hostility toward the Confederacy with workers' rights as the central plank of the party's platform. The rejection of this proposal led to Lincoln's defection to the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] and the end of the Republican Party as an effective force in American politics.

===Haywood, Bill===
(GW:WH)

Like he was in our timeline, '''[[Bill Haywood|"Big Bill" Haywood]]''' is a [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] bigwig in the U.S. during the Great War. He is introduced to Flora Hamburger by Herman Bruck at a [[May Day]] rally, and eyes her with lust.  Flora doesn't seem to like him, but does acknowledge that he brings a furious energy to the cause that makes him a force to be reckoned with.

===Hemingway, Ernest===
(GW:WH, AE:CCH-AE:VO)

Known only as "Ernie", the novelist '''[[Ernest Hemingway]]''' was an [[ambulance]] driver in the U.S. Army on the [[Québec]] front in the Great War (in our timeline Hemingway drove an ambulance in [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]] during [[World War I]]), Ernest was strafed by a [[Royal Flying Corps|British aircraft]] and severely wounded in the groin. After the war, his [[impotence]] served as a constant frustration. He ghost-wrote Sylvia Enos' book, ''I Sank Roger Kimball'', and was involved in an affair with his client. He accidentally shoots her when attempting [[suicide]] while he is drunk. He then shoots himself in remorse. (In our timeline, Hemingway lived to 1961, shooting himself to death but no one else.) In the Southern Victory Series,  he never becomes a prominent author—though he does have work published.

===Holmes, Oliver Wendell===
(GW:WH-AE:VO)

'''[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]]''' becomes Chief Justice of the United States rather than associate justice, as he does in our timeline. He is one of the last surviving [[US Civil War|War of Secession]] veterans and manages to outlive even General [[George Armstrong Custer]]. Holmes is a staunch Democratic supporter, who is very displeased in 1920 at having to administer the oath of office to [[Upton Sinclair]], the first Socialist President. He dies in 1935 (the same year of his death in our timeline) during [[Herbert Hoover]]'s administration. He is replaced as Chief Justice by Cicero Pittman in time for [[Al Smith]]'s inauguration in 1937.

===Hoover, Herbert===
(AE:CCH-AE:VO)

'''[[Herbert Hoover]]''' was part of the Coolidge-Hoover Democratic ticket that defeated the Blackford-[[Hiram Johnson|Johnson]] Socialist ticket during the Democratic sweep in [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932]]. When President-Elect [[Calvin Coolidge]] died less than a month before he got into office, Hoover took over. The only thing his term was known for was making the situation in [[Kentucky]], [[Texas Panhandle|Houston]], [[Oklahoma|Sequoyah]], and [[Utah]] worse. He ended the Pacific War with a [[status quo ante bellum]] "peace" with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] and allowed [[Jake Featherston]] to begin rebuilding the [[Confederate Army]] in the face of the "black rebellion". Hoover was also derided for not doing anything to help the [[Great Depression]]. Because of this, the Democrats were defeated with a Socialist sweep the Congressional elections of 1934 and he lost the presidential race to Socialist [[Al Smith]] in [[United States presidential election, 1936|1936]].

===Humphrey, Hubert===
(AE:VO)

'''[[Hubert Humphrey]]''' is referred to as the "[[pharmacist]] from [[Minneapolis]]." He wisely decides not to move his business to [[Rosenfeld, Manitoba]], where the local [[general store]] (owned by an American) had been bombed by Mary MacGregor Pomeroy several years before.

===Johnson, Hiram===
(AE:CCH)

'''[[Hiram Johnson]]''' was the Socialist nominee for vice-president in both the [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928]] and [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932 elections]]. He and [[Hosea Blackford]] won the 1928 election over [[Calvin Coolidge]]; the victory was clinched after the Socialists won Johnson's home state of [[California]]. He was present at the Socialist party rally that was held on the same day that [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] raided [[Los Angeles]]. Blackford and Johnson were easily defeated in 1932 by Coolidge and [[Herbert Hoover]].

===Kennedy, Joseph P. Sr.===
(AE:CCH-AE:VO, SA:ID)

'''[[Joseph Kennedy]]''', in this timeline, was a Democratic Party [[organizer (party)|organizer]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Although married to [[Rose Kennedy]] and the father of [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.]], he attempted to seduce Sylvia Enos, who was a minor heroine for killing Roger Kimball, and was campaigning for him at his political rallies.

After the Second Great War, Kennedy helped obtain the discharge of George Enos Jr., from the navy to allow him to return to civilian life.

===Kennedy, Joseph Jr.===
(SA:RE)

'''[[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.|Joseph Kennedy, Jr.]]''' is a [[fighter pilot]] serving in the same squadron as Jonathan Moss during Operation [[Blackbeard]]. It is unknown whether he survived the Second Great War. In our timeline, he did not survive [[World War II]].

===La Follette, Robert M.===
(GW:WH)

'''[[Robert M. La Follette]]''' was a Socialist U.S. Senator from [[Wisconsin]]. In 1916, he won re-election handily. His son [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Charles W. La Follette|Charles]] (who is primarily modeled after his real life son [[Robert M. La Follette, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/HNTurtledove/status/1000485494503849985&lt;/ref&gt;) went on to become a key figure of American history in the 1930s and '40s.

===LaGuardia, Fiorello===
(AE:VO)

'''[[Fiorello LaGuardia]]''' is elected [[governor of New York]] on the Socialist ticket and attends the [[New York City]] Remembrance Day parade shortly before the beginning of the Second Great War.

===Lansing, Robert===
(GW:B)

===Liggett, Hunter===
(AE:BI-AE:CCH)

'''[[Hunter Liggett]]''' replaced General [[Leonard Wood]] as Army Chief of Staff under President [[Upton Sinclair]]. He appeared unenthusiastic about some of the Socialists' more unrealistic policies.

===Lincoln, Abraham===
(HFR, GW:AF)

In this timeline, '''[[Abraham Lincoln]]''' was a one-term president who was defeated in the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 election]] in a landslide, and who was generally remembered as a failure. After his presidency, he travels around the country as an [[orator]] advocating for labor rights. In 1881, feeling that the Republican party was no longer true to its original roots, he led a faction of the party to break off and join the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] with Marxist activist [[Friedrich Sorge]], which eventually became the major opposition to the Democrats and one of the two main parties in the American political system. After which, he spends the rest of his days in seclusion outside [[Chicago]].

In the prologue of ''Great War: American Front,'' while considering the mediation put forth by British ambassador Richard Lyons, Lincoln makes a solemn vow that the United States would find European allies to someday get even with England and France for their violating of the [[Monroe Doctrine]] and helping of the CSA. Though laughed at by Lyons, his prediction would eventually come true by the Great War.

===Lincoln, Mary Todd===
(HFR)

'''[[Mary Todd Lincoln]]''' was the wife of former President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. As her husband was not assassinated in 1865, she did not suffer from mental illness. In the late 1870s, Mary Lincoln died of typhus.

===Mahan, Alfred Thayer===
(GW:WH)

'''[[Alfred Mahan]]''' was a two-term Democratic president from 1889 to 1897. During his time in office, Mahan threatened to declare war on the Confederate States because of a proposal by the CSA to build a canal in Nicaragua in order to reach their Pacific port in Guaymas, Sonora, without having to travel around South America. After receiving the threat of war, the CSA backed down in their attempt to build the canal. [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Carsten, Sam|Sam Carsten]] mentions that he might be the best President the country had ever had before [[Theodore Roosevelt]].

===Moran, Edward===
(AE:VO)

Congressman '''[[Edward C. Moran, Jr.]]''' of [[Maine]] is a Democrat who debates Flora Blackford on whether or not the United States should interfere with the treatment of blacks in the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]].

===Patrick, Mason===
(GW:AF-GW:B)

[[Brigadier General]] '''[[Mason Patrick]]''' was a senior aviator in the [[U.S. Army]] air service and served on the [[Canada|Canadian]] front in the Great War.

===Pershing, John "Black Jack"===
(GW:AF-AE:CCH)

'''[[John Pershing]]''' was commanding general of the US Second Army and rival of [[George Custer]]'s First Army in the Great War. After the Socialist victory over the Democrats, he became [[military governor]] of [[Utah]]. In 1929, a [[Mormon]] sniper killed him, and he was succeeded by Colonel Abner Dowling, erstwhile commandant of [[Salt Lake City]].

===Pitney, Mahlon===
(AE:BI)

Rather than being appointed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1912, as he was in our timeline, '''[[Mahlon Pitney]]''' goes to Canada to preside over trials in occupied country.

===Pope, John===
(HFR)

'''[[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]]''' was the commander of U.S. forces in [[Utah]] during the Second Mexican War. He was responsible for ordering the [[execution]] of several [[Mormon]] leaders during the attempted revolt in Utah. Pope also arrested former president [[Abraham Lincoln]] for allegedly having Mormon sympathies, but President [[James Blaine]] ordered Lincoln's release.

===Reagan, Ronald===
(AE:VO)

'''[[Ronald Reagan]]''', "Dutch", like this timeline's counterpart, was a sports announcer in [[Iowa]] between the wars. His favorite phrase in games is "There he goes again" (similar to one of Reagan's most familiar phrases in our timeline, "[[There you go again]]"). Cincinnatus Driver also describes "Dutch" as a "great communicator", a description applied to the historical Reagan.

===Reed, Thomas Brackett===
(GW:AF)

'''[[Thomas Brackett Reed]]''' was a Democratic president sometime in the late 1890s. Like [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]], Reed was considered a hero of the Remembrance ideology. Reed entered the United States into a mutual-defense pact with [[Haiti]]. Presumably this helped curb [[Confederate States of America|CSA]] designs in the [[Caribbean]] while at the same time irritating the CS government, which had long desired the destruction of the former slave colony. This pact was reaffirmed by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] during the Great War.

Reed was depicted on a [[United States half dollar coin|fifty-cent coin]] used as currency during the Great War.

===Rickover, Hyman G.===
(SA:ID)

Captain '''[[Hyman G. Rickover]]''', [[U.S. Navy]] testifies before a House of Representatives committee, as an expert on [[submarines]] (as he was in our timeline).  Rickover has the unpleasant task of explaining why the U.S. has not yet built copies of [[German High Seas Fleet]] submarines.

===Rogers, Will===
(AE:VO)

'''[[Will Rogers]]''' is referred to as "that comic from [[State of Sequoyah|Sequoyah]]" (part of [[Oklahoma]] native in the main timeline). As in our timeline, he is quoted as having said, "All I know is what I read in the newspapers."

{{anchor|Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt|Roosevelt, Franklin}}

===Roosevelt, Franklin D.===
(AE:CCH, SA:RE-SA:ID)

'''[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]''' is Secretary of War in the [[Herbert Hoover]] administration and later Assistant Secretary of War under the [[Alfred E. Smith]] and [[Charles La Follette]] Administrations. He is not much in the public eye, but plays a key role being in charge of the United States [[Manhattan Project|nuclear program]] at the [[Hanford site]]. Roosevelt is [[paraplegic]] and uses a [[wheelchair]]. He has a platonic affair with Flora Blackford. There is no mention of his being married in this timeline to [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. It noted that his son (who goes unnamed) is in the [[US Navy]] during the Second Great War.

===Roosevelt, Theodore===
(HFR-AE:CCH)

'''[[Theodore Roosevelt]]''', called '''Teddy''' or '''TR''' in the press, became a national figure for leading a volunteer cavalry unit, the "Unauthorized Regiment," in the [[Second Mexican War]], during which he developed an intense rivalry with [[George Custer]]. A member of the Democratic Party, he was [[President of the United States]] from 1913 to 1921. Roosevelt was the first president to run for a third term, but he was ultimately defeated by Socialist [[Upton Sinclair]] in [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920]]. After he died suddenly of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] while [[golf]]ing in 1924, he was buried at [[Robert E. Lee]]'s house in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]] which had been annexed to [[West Virginia]] from [[Virginia]] after the Great War. He died in 1919 in our timeline.

===Rosecrans, William===
(HFR)

'''[[William Rosecrans]]''' was a lead general in the Second Mexican War. He was partly responsible for the U.S. defeat as he admitted to observers on the [[Kentucky]] front that he had no real strategy to defeat the [[Confederate States]].

===Sevareid, Eric===
(SA:ID)

'''[[Eric Sevareid]]''' was a [[radio]] broadcaster for U.S. Wireless [[Atlanta]], which was established after the fall of Atlanta, possibly to counter Confederate Connie. After the death of [[Jake Featherston]], Sevareid was one of the broadcasters who interviewed Cassius Madison.

===Shaw, Robert Gould===
(GW:AF)

Ironically, '''[[Robert Gould Shaw]]''', the man who in our timeline led the [[54th Massachusetts]], one of the first all black regiments in the [[US Civil War]], ends up surviving through the War of Secession, though losing a hand in the process, and lives on until 1914 in [[Boston]]. He was depicted as an elderly [[racist]] with little money.

===Sherman, William T.===
(HFR)

Despite having fought with valor and distinction at the historical [[Battle of Bull Run (disambiguation)|Battles of Bull Run]] and [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]], the victories of '''[[William Tecumseh Sherman]]''' amounted to nothing after the United States' defeat at [[Camp Hill, Glenn Springs, South Carolina|Camp Hill]] and the encirclement of [[Washington, DC]]. Sherman was stripped of his rank of [[brigadier general]] and would never command regular troops again.  Sherman remained in the [[US Army]] and by 1881, he commanded the defences of [[San Francisco]] from his headquarters at the [[Presidio of San Francisco|Presidio]]. When the Second Mexican War began later that year, Sherman organised volunteers and harbour guns in preparation for any attacks. His efforts were mocked by [[Samuel Clemens]] in his newspaper, the San Francisco ''Morning Call''. Because of this, he investigated Clemens on suspicion that he was a Confederate agent, but found nothing to substantiate it and gave Clemens a letter to that effect.

As the war dragged on, the [[Royal Navy]] of the United Kingdom turned up the pressure against the United States in support of their Confederate ally and attacked San Francisco. In spite of Sherman's preparations, the harbour guns were ineffective and his troops proved inadequate in stopping the [[Royal Marines]] from raiding the [[San Francisco Mint]]. After the raid, Sherman was ridiculed in the city's papers. However, after the cease fire was called, Sherman loudly insisted that with more fortifications, he could make the city impregnable.

===Shirer, William===
(SA:ID)

'''[[William Shirer]]''' is a U.S. broadcaster who interviews Cassius Madison in his tour of the U.S. after killing [[Jake Featherston]].

===Sinclair, Upton===
(AE:BI-AE:VO)

'''[[Upton Sinclair]]''' was the first [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] President. He was elected over [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920 election]] for a number of reasons, including (but not limited to) worker unrest, outrage at Roosevelt's decision to run for a third term, and the public's general exhaustion with the Remembrance ideology. His first acts were to slash the military budget, force [[George Custer|General Custer]] into retirement and enact new labor laws. He was re-elected in [[United States presidential election, 1924|1924]], where he and the Socialist Party take credit for the [[Roaring Twenties]] prosperity. Sinclair declined to run for a third term in [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928]] and was succeeded in office by his Vice President, [[Hosea Blackford]], who defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic candidate]] [[Calvin Coolidge]] by a narrow margin.

===Smith, Al===
(AE:VO-SA:RE)

'''[[Al Smith]]''' is elected as the third Socialist (and first [[Catholic]]) President in the [[United States presidential election, 1936|1936 election]], defeating Democrat [[Herbert Hoover]]. He is known as the "Happy Warrior" since he tries everything to keep the United States out of war with [[Jake Featherston]]'s [[Confederate States]], including the infamous Richmond Agreement, helping to gain him re-election over [[Robert A. Taft|Robert Taft]] in [[United States presidential election, 1940|1940]]. All of Smith's efforts simply delay the inevitable; Featherston scraps any agreement with Smith and once again demands territorial concession.  Smith refuses, touching off the Second Great War in June, 1941 (in an operation patterned after OTL's [[Operation Barbarossa]]). Smith is killed in his second term (1942) when Confederate bombers blew up parts of [[Powel House]] and destroy his [[bunker]].

Smith shares parallels with [[Neville Chamberlain]], who attempted, but failed, to prevent war in our timeline with a [[fascist]] regime through the use of [[appeasement]].

===Smith, Kate===
(SA:G)

'''[[Kate Smith]]''' was a famous U.S. singer in this timeline as well as ours. In 1943, she sang "[[God Bless America|God Bless the Stars and Stripes]]" with backing by [[Satchmo]] and the Rhythm Aces.

===Sousa, John Philip===
(GW:AF and AE:BI)

The marches of '''[[John Philip Sousa]]''' in this timeline were very popular in the United States. The Socialists despised him as a tool who substituted nationalist desires for vengeance for the class struggle, but respected his talents.

===Stassen, Harold===
(SA:ID)

'''[[Harold Stassen]]''' was peripherally mentioned as "the governor of [[Minnesota]]" as the Republican Party's candidate for President in the [[United States presidential election, 1944|1944 election]], carrying electoral votes from the four states of [[Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Kansas]], and [[Indiana]] in a three-way race against Socialist [[Charles M. LaFollette|Charles W. La Follette]] and Democrat [[Thomas E. Dewey]].

===Stedman, Seymour===
(AE:BI)

'''[[Seymour Stedman]]''' was a Socialist Congressman from [[Ohio]]. In the Socialist-majority Congress of 1919, he was elected [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]. Stedman became the first non-Democrat since 1881 to be elected as Speaker.

===Sutro, Adolph===
(HFR)

'''[[Adolph Sutro]]''' is still the mayor of [[San Francisco]], [[California]] as in our timeline. His mayorship was heavily criticized for incompetence, particularly after the British [[Royal Navy]] bombarded the city and [[Royal Marines]] raided the [[San Francisco Mint]].  Sutro was a supporter of President [[James G. Blaine]] and designed several outlandish security measures to protect San Francisco (which was an extremely low priority target) from attack during the Second Mexican War. Ironically, when the British did attack the city, the defenses Sutro proposed proved worthless.

One of Sutro's most vocal critics was [[Samuel Clemens]], who named his dog Sutro as an insult to the mayor.

===Taft, Robert===
(AE:VO, SA:DE-SA:G)

'''[[Robert A. Taft]]''' was a Democratic Senator from [[Ohio]] who ran against [[Al Smith]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1940|1940 presidential election]]. Taft was narrowly defeated running his campaign on an anti-Freedom Party line and the refusal to permit the states of [[Kentucky]] and [[Texas Panhandle|Houston]] to hold a [[plebiscite]] to return to the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]]. During the Second Great War, he and former rival Flora Blackford (who had known [[William H. Taft|his father]] before him) became fast friends and political allies as Flora became more hawkish as the war went on. Taft died in 1943, a victim of a [[Mormon]] [[suicide bomber]] in [[Philadelphia]].

===Taft, William Howard===
(GW:B-AE:BI)

'''[[William Howard Taft]]''' was a Democratic Congressman from [[Ohio]] who served on the Transportation Committee during the later days of the Great War. He was on the same committee as Socialist congresswoman Flora Hamburger, and the two frequently disagreed on many political issues. His son [[Robert A. Taft]] became an important ally of hers during the Second Great War.

===Thomas, Norman===
(AE:BI-AE:CCH)

'''[[Norman Thomas|N. Mattoon Thomas]]''' served as Undersecretary of War in the [[Upton Sinclair]] Administration, often as Sinclair's hatchet man. He was responsible for informing General [[George A. Custer]] of his forced retirement and for closing down the [[tank|Barrel]] Works.

===Tilden, Samuel J.===
(HFR)

'''[[Samuel Tilden]]''' was [[President of the United States]] from 1877 to 1881. He was nominated by the Democrats for [[United States presidential election, 1880|reelection in 1880]], but lost to Republican [[James G. Blaine]]. Tilden was defeated for not taking a hard line against the Confederate States and for ordering the removal of twelve stars (representing the former Union states in the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]]) from the U.S. flag.

===Truman, Harry===
(SA:ID)

'''[[Harry Truman]]''' was a Democratic Senator from [[Missouri]] who was selected by [[New York Governor]] [[Thomas E. Dewey]] as the Democratic VP candidate in [[United States presidential election, 1944|1944]]. The Dewey-Truman ticket defeated the incumbent President [[Charles M. La Follette|Charles W. La Follette]]. In announcing the Democratic victory, Truman had a copy of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' that had the inaccurate headline "[[Dewey Defeats Truman|La Follete Beats Dewey]]". Truman made an appearance in occupied [[Florida]] to speak to U.S. soldiers before his inauguration as Vice President. He made it clear to the locals that the United States would be firm in the former Confederate States, but that they would be no firmer than needed, and that if they worked together they could one day be part of the same country once again.

===Voorhis, Jerry===
(AE:VO)

'''[[Jerry Voorhis]]''' was the United States ambassador to the [[Confederate States]] prior to the start of the Second Great War. After delivering news to [[Jake Featherston]] that U.S. president [[Al Smith]] refused the latest C.S. territorial demands, the C.S. president told Voorhis to leave the country within 24 hours; soon after this meeting, Featherston authorized the commencement of Operation [[Blackbeard]].

===Wallace, Henry===

'''[[John Wayne]]''' is an actor known in this world under his real name, Marion Morrison. He played [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in a movie that recounted the details of the Battle of [[Montana]] in ''How Few Remain''.

===Willkie, Wendell===
(AE:VO)

'''[[Wendell Willkie]]''' was the Republican nominee for president in the [[United States presidential election, 1940|1940 election]], both in this timeline and our history. As the Republicans had become a third party in this timeline, Willkie was not considered to seriously contend for the presidency. On election day, he only carried the electoral votes from his home state of [[Indiana]] and came in third after [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] incumbent [[Al Smith]] and the Democratic challenger [[Robert A. Taft|Robert Taft]]. Ironically, Willkie's slogan was "Win With Wendell".

===Winchell, Walter===
(SA:ID)

'''[[Walter Winchell]]''' was a news reporter from [[New York City]] who was one of those to interview Cassius Madison after he shot [[Jake Featherston]]. During his interview with Winchell, Cassius found his accent difficult to understand.

He offers Jonathan Moss the opportunity to train to fly [[jet aircraft|turbo aircraft]]. Moss gladly takes him up on his offer.

==Confederate States==

===Arango, Doroteo===
(GW:AF-GW:WH, AE:BI)

During the Great War, '''[[Pancho Villa|Doroteo Arango]]''' (known by the ''[[nom de guerre]]'' "Pancho Villa" in our timeline) was the Radical Liberal presidential candidate in the 1915 election. He promised he would fight the war against the United States even harder than [[Woodrow Wilson]] did. He is also the first non-white candidate to seriously run for the presidency of the Confederacy and showed the wartime strains on the ruling Whig Party, as the war dragged on and the United States' numbers and the Red Rebellion started to strain the Confederates. He was not opposed due to his ethnicity (Mixed "Mestizo" Mexican), only his political views. The [[Mexican Revolution]] in which our timeline's Pancho Villa had a major role has its counterpart in the Republican revolt against the [[Habsburg]] Emperors of this timeline's [[Second Mexican Empire|Mexico]], which is crushed with the help of Freedom Party stalwarts. However, in the Confederate-annexed parts of Mexico, it is the Freedom Party itself which mobilises the peasants to overthrow the centuries-old rule of the big landowners.

===Benjamin, Judah===
(HFR)

'''[[Judah P. Benjamin]]''' was [[Confederate States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] under President [[Jefferson Davis]], and served in the Cabinets of many others of the Confederacy's first generation of leaders. He led his country's diplomatic efforts in the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]]. During the presidency of [[James Longstreet]], Judah Benjamin was the ambassador to the United States. Despite his best efforts, he was not able to prevent the [[Second Mexican War]] of 1881–82.

During the closing days of the Second Mexican War, Benjamin became aware that Senator [[Wade Hampton III]] was attempting to recruit support for a coup should Longstreet go through with his plans to end slavery. He also knew that Hampton had unsuccessfully attempted to recruit [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas Jackson]], a fact which surprised Jackson.

===Black, Hugo===
(AE:CCH)

'''[[Hugo Black]]''' was the Whig Party's Vice-Presidential nominee in 1933 during the Freedom electoral sweep. He ran with [[James Longstreet]]'s grandson [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Samuel Longstreet|Samuel Longstreet]], and was caught in a riot against Freedom Party stalwarts during the 1933 Election Riots. The Longstreet-Black ticket lost in a landslide to the [[Jake Featherston|Featherston]]-Knight ticket. This defeat made it the first Presidential election in Confederate history where the Whig candidates lost.

===Castro, Fidel===

{{anchor|Nathan Bedford Forrest III}}

===Forrest, Nathan Bedford III===
(AE:VO-SA:ID)

A great-grandson of [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] was the head of the Confederate General Staff. Instead of airplane warfare, '''[[Nathan Bedford Forrest III]]''', was a [[tank|barrel]] expert. Forrest was valued by [[Jake Featherston]] because he was unafraid to tell the President the truth about how the war was going, instead of being a "yes man" and only telling him what he wanted to hear. When an increasingly stubborn Featherston rejects Forrest's advice to cut short the [[Pittsburgh]] Campaign, thus dooming [[George Patton]]'s entire army of irreplaceable veterans to death or surrender, he begins plotting with Clarence Potter based on concerns about Featherston's sanity and whether new leadership was needed, for Forrest fears a Confederate loss and what the Yankees would do if they defeated the Confederacy again.

With the Confederate war effort collapsing, Forrest attempted to execute a coup to oust Featherston in 1944, analogous to the [[July 20 Plot]], but was thwarted by the President. Forrest never revealed that he had ever discussed the failed coup with Potter. Eventually, Forrest was killed off for his attempt.

===Hope, Bob===

The Conan the Barbarian creator is an unnamed reference in a Jefferson Pinkard chapter as a contributor to Aeroplane Adventures. The book references a young Texan author from Cross Plains where Howard lives for most of his short life; in reality this would have been around the time he wrote ‘The Shadow Kingdom’, which was published in Weird Times.

===Jackson, Thomas J. "Stonewall"===
(HFR)

Because of the Confederate victory in 1862, '''[[Stonewall Jackson]]''' did not die in 1863 as he did in our timeline. In the twenty years from the [[US Civil War|War of Secession]] to the Second Mexican War, Jackson became the head of the Confederate General Staff in the [[James Longstreet]] Administration. His brilliant tactics in the Second Mexican War led to victory for the Confederacy. Also critical to the Confederate cause was his decision to let the captured [[Frederick Douglass]] go free, after a memorable debate between the two showing some grudging mutual respect - a decision which eventually helped the Confederacy cement British and [[Third French Republic|French]] support for its cause. Subsequently, Jackson refused [[Wade Hampton III]]'s proposal to lead a coup against Longstreet after Longstreet began steps to end slavery.

His face appeared on the Confederate five-dollar coin, which naturally came to be called a "Stonewall".

===Lamar, Lucius Q. C.===
(HFR)

'''[[Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar (II)|Lucius Lamar]]''' is the vice president of the Confederate States under his cousin [[James Longstreet]]. It is mentioned that Lamar would have acted as president should anything have happened to President Longstreet while he visited the war front in [[Kentucky]].

===Lee, Robert E.===
(GW:AF)

'''[[Robert E. Lee]]''' is the Confederacy's military hero. It is his decision to invade [[Maryland]], and the complete failure of Union general [[George B. McClellan|George McClellan]] to respond that allows the CS to gain military victory, and receive recognition as a country from Britain and France.

Lee appears briefly in the prologue of GW:AF, which is set in 1862. He is heavily referenced throughout the series.

In AE:CCH, we learn that a man named 'Lee' was president. As Robert E. Lee was never said to have been president in the prior volumes, nor so described in subsequent volumes, a debate has developed among fans of the series, with some arguing that Robert E. was president, while others favor his more political nephew, [[Fitzhugh Lee]].

There is one apparent difference between Turtledove's character and the historic Lee. In our timeline, Lee became the president of Washington College in [[Lexington, Virginia]] immediately after the Civil War. He served in that role until his death in 1870, at which time the college adopted its current name of [[Washington and Lee University]]. In the Southern Victory Series, the college never added Lee's name—it is referenced in several books in the series as Washington University.

===Long, Earl===
(AE:VO)

After the assassination of their sibling, we learn that one of Governor [[Huey Long]]'s brothers is involved in some sort of machine gun "accident" and the other is imprisoned at "Camp Dependable" outside Alexandria, Louisiana for his brother's non-Freedom Party politics. Although in our timeline Huey Long had three brothers, George, Julius and '''[[Earl Long]]''', in the Southern Victory Series he has only two.

===Long, Huey===
(AE:CCH-AE:VO)

In this timeline, '''[[Huey Long]]''' was a Radical Liberal governor of [[Louisiana]] in the [[Confederate States]]. Like [[Jake Featherston]], he used strong-arm tactics to suppress opposition and control that state, erected prison camps for political opponents, but did not resort to anti-black [[racist]] demagoguery. He proved to be a danger to the Freedom Party in the 1932 elections and afterwards, where the Freedom Party was under attack in his state, and planned to run for president once Featherston ended his term (at the time, the clause in the Confederate constitution restricting a president to a single term was still in force). He was later killed by an assassin of the Freedom Party in 1938 after getting a warning about not following Jake Featherston's orders from [[Anne Colleton]]. (He lived 3 years longer than he did in our timeline.) This assassination allowed Featherston to have the entire Confederacy under his control. The conquest of Louisiana from Long and his followers is roughly the analogue of [[Hitler]]'s Austrian [[Anschluss]].

===Longstreet, James===
(HFR)

'''[[James Longstreet]]''' was a victorious Confederate general turned president of the CSA serving 1880-1886. Although having a reputation as being an opportunist, his term was known for the second defeat of the United States in the Second Mexican War and the [[manumission]] of the [[slaves]] as the price of British and French alliance for help in the Second Mexican War. Longstreet also prevented, with [[Stonewall Jackson]]'s help, a planned rebellion by [[Wade Hampton III]].

===Mahon, George===
(AE:VO)

'''[[George H. Mahon|George Mahon]]''' was a Freedom Party Congressman from the State of [[Texas Panhandle|Houston]] who was among the Congressmen (from Houston and [[Kentucky]]) who demanded that plebiscites be held in order to return to the Confederate States (Houston had joined the U.S. in 1917). He eventually got his wish, and on January 7, 1941, Houston, along with Kentucky, was returned to the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]] by popular vote, and was restored to the state of [[Texas]].

===McReynolds, James Clark===
(AE:CCH-AE:VO)

'''[[James Clark McReynolds]]''' was the last Chief Justice of the Confederate Supreme Court. He played a key role in the ruling allowing Burton Mitchel to run again out of fear of the Freedom Party after the Hampton assassination. Later he was noted for his battles in the early months of the first [[Jake Featherston]] administration, most importantly the "torpedoing" of the River and Dam Act. (This is roughly analogous to the opposition of McReynolds to much of [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] legislation in our timeline.) This led to the Featherston Administration finding a way to abolish the Supreme Court before it could strike down any more Freedom laws, (analogous to FDR's "Court Packing" plan in our timeline) and because Featherston wanted to settle accounts with the Court for its allowing Mitchel to run for re-election.

Attorney General Ferdinand Koenig pounced on the precedent of the CSA not having a Supreme Court for the first five years of existence, and forced McReynolds to admit to the legality of that precedent as prelude to having the Supreme Court knocked down, to great fanfare across the Confederacy's white population. Threatened with his life by Featherston if he trifled with the abolition of the Supreme Court, McReynolds retired into private life. The Confederate president then went on the [[radio]] to declare: "James McReynolds has made his decision, now let him enforce it!" (echoing [[Worcester v. Georgia#Jackson's response|a quote attributed to Andrew Jackson]] following an 1832 U.S. Supreme Court decision).

===Patman, Wright===
(SA:ID)

'''[[Wright Patman]]''' was the [[Governor of Texas]] during the Second Great War. In 1944, with the U.S. close to defeating the [[Confederate States of America|C.S.]], Patman seceded his state from the Confederacy and declared an independent [[Republic of Texas]] with himself as President. His first act was to obtain an armistice with the U.S., who immediately recognized his nation, although they continued stationing large numbers of soldiers there. To win brownie points with his new overlords, he turned over all Confederate [[war criminals]] that could be found in Texas, including [[Jefferson Pinkard]], for [[crimes against humanity]] trials.

===Patton, George S.===
(SA:RE-SA:ID)

General '''[[George S. Patton]]''', [[C.S. Army]], was in charge of the Confederate armored forces (Army of [[Kentucky]]) in Operation [[Blackbeard]] in [[Ohio]] and the attack on [[Pittsburgh]]. He had many of the same character traits as our timeline's Patton: strict attention to detail in a soldier's appearance, high standards and a short temper, highly-effective use of armor, and a seemingly-limitless drive and energy that inspired great confidence among the soldiers serving under him and made him an outstanding commander. But Patton in this timeline is also a different man known to us: instead of being the first American general to integrate his combat formations, this Patton is an unabashed racist and strong supporter of the Freedom Party.

Patton was evacuated from the pocket at Pittsburgh before it fell in February 1943. He unsuccessfully tried to hold the U.S. Army out of Kentucky and [[Tennessee]]. This included an [[George S. Patton slapping incidents|incident]] where he slapped a soldier suffering from [[Combat stress reaction|battle fatigue]]. He would have shot the soldier save that other soldiers around them threatened to shoot Patton on the spot. He was reprimanded for this incident by President [[Jake Featherston]], who promised the average soldier a fair shake. Patton intensely disliked Brigadier General Clarence Potter and would have fought him in a duel had Featherston not forbidden it.

Patton was a fierce and aggressive commander, but as the war turned against the Confederate States, Patton's instincts to attack every chance he got largely succeeded only in squandering men and materiel that the Confederacy could not easily replace. Patton's aggressiveness was checked by General [[Irving Morrell]], a punning reference to the real Patton's African contest with [[Erwin Rommel]]. When he switched tactics to fight a delaying action in [[Chattanooga]], he was bypassed by a U.S. airborne assault on the hills overlooking the city. Because of this, the U.S. drove to [[Atlanta]], disgracing him in Jake Featherston's eyes.

By 1944, Patton was forced to flee Atlanta and head into [[Alabama]]. With the U.S. ravaging his army, Patton was eventually forced to surrender in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. After giving a farewell address to his forces, his men crowded around to say their own goodbyes, an act which moved Patton to tears. He was subsequently taken in as a prisoner of war.

Note: Though a [[Virginia]]n in the Southern Victory timeline, in our timeline Patton was born in [[California]]. In our timeline, General Patton's father, [[George S. Patton (attorney)|George William Patton]], was born in Virginia before Civil War, later moved to California in 1877. General Patton's grandfather, [[George S. Patton, Sr.]] was a Confederate colonel from Virginia killed in 1864 (an event which would not have happened in the alternate timeline). Because of Confederate won the Civil War in this timeline, General Patton's father wasn't likely to move to California, which is a Northern territory. With a Virginian military family background, it is highly possible that General Patton play the role as a Confederate General in an alternative world which Confederate won.

===Russell, Richard Brevard Jr.===
(AE:VO)

'''[[Richard Brevard Russell, Jr.]]''' was the Confederate Ambassador to the United States before the Second World War. He was kicked out of the U.S. after President [[Jake Featherston]] kicked out the Confederacy's U.S. ambassador [[Jerry Voorhis]] from the C.S. as well.

{{anchor|Sennacherib_.28.22Satchmo.22.29|Louis Armstrong|Satchmo}}

===Satchmo===
(AE:VO, SA:RE-SA:G)

Known in the Southern Victory world as '''Sennacherib ("Satchmo")''', [[Louis Armstrong]] in the [[Confederate States]], during the rise of the Freedom Party and the Featherston Administration, was the leader of the popular band "Satchmo and the Rhythm Aces". He was forced by the Confederate government during Second Great War to play for Confederate troops in Ohio. Satchmo and his band were able to escape to U.S. lines at night after one of their shows. In ''[[Drive to the East]]'', Satchmo and his band share the horrors of the Featherston government's treatment of [[African-Americans]] with Flora Blackford.  Subsequently, Satchmo and the Rhythm Aces produce [[propaganda]] for the U.S., although their style of music, unknown outside of the C.S., is a bit of a mystery to the average U.S. citizen.

===Stuart, James Ewell Brown===
(HFR)

Because of the CSA's victory in 1862, '''[[Jeb Stuart]]''' did not die in 1864 [[Battle of Yellow Tavern|as he did in history]]. During the Second Mexican War, General Stuart arrived in the former [[Second Mexican Empire|Mexican]] provinces of [[Sonora]] and [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] in order to ease their transition into C.S. territories (later states). After joining forces with [[Geronimo]] for raids on [[Arizona|western New Mexico]], Stuart was killed by an [[Apache]] [[sniper]] near the close of the war in 1882. His son Jeb Stuart Jr. (a person who had never known his father in real life) later became head of the Confederate War Department, and his (fictionalized) grandson Jeb Stuart III was a battery command officer on the [[Virginia]] front in the Great War.

J.E.B Stuart III once prevented Army intelligence from interrogating his manservant.  Later it was revealed that this servant had been a spy and a [[communist]] rebel. Stuart was humiliated, and assured by many that he would never rise above the rank of captain, despite his father's position in the war department. Destroyed, Stuart decided glory was all he had left, and died leading a charge across No Man's land.

This would greatly impact history, because it was [[Jake Featherston]] who had reported the man servant, and Stuart's father blamed him for his son's humiliation.  He ensured that Featherston also was never promoted, which infuriated Featherston forever after, leading him to write his infamous book ''Over Open Sights'', and later to purge the old military upon his ascension to [[President of the Confederate States]].  After that point, promotion and rank in the new army was based solely on talent and loyalty, which unfortunately for the United States, worked very well in the opening months of Operation [[Blackbeard]].

=== Stuart, James Ewell Brown, Jr. ===
(HFR, AE:BI, AE:VO)

It is debatable whether "Jeb Stuart Jr." in this series is a historical character or a fictional one, see his article on [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Stuart, Jeb Jr.|a different page]].

===Thurmond, Strom===
(SA:RE)

'''[[Strom Thurmond]]''' was a Freedom Party Congressman from [[South Carolina]]. He is as conservative in this timeline as he was in ours. His name is never mentioned, but the viewpoint character [[Anne Colleton]] thinks of him as "Storm, or something like that." Good on the "[[Negro]] question, but weaker elsewhere" was the view expressed of him by Anne, who was killed during the June 1941 [[U.S. navy]] raid on [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] just after Thurmond gave a speech. It is unknown whether Thurmond was killed in the same raid.

===Walker, George Herbert===
(SA:DE)

[[Confederate Secretary of State]] during the Featherston Administration, '''[[George Herbert Walker]]''' is probably one of the few remaining old-liners to remain from the Whig Era into the Freedom Regime, since he is not considered to be part of the Freedom Party inner circle by Featherston. Walker is placed in charge of obtaining more soldiers from [[Second Mexican Empire|Mexico]] to aid the Confederacy after General Morrell's attacks destroyed the first three divisions in the 1942 U.S. offensive in [[Ohio]].

This is a little bit implausible, as Walker was from [[Missouri]] and his father [[David Davis Walker]] was from [[Illinois]], neither of which were Confederate states in this timeline or ours.

===Wilson, Woodrow===
(GW:AF-GW:WH)

'''[[Woodrow Wilson]]''' was [[President of the Confederate States of America|President of the Confederate States]] from 1910 to 1916 on the Whig Party. He led the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]] to war with the United States in the summer of 1914, following the US declaration of war on the Confederacy.

==Native Americans==

===Geronimo===
(HFR)

'''[[Geronimo]]''' led a band of [[Apache]] warriors into an alliance with [[Jeb Stuart]]'s army during the Second Mexican War. The alliance would not outlast the war. He led a rebellion against the Confederates following a dispute in territory occupied in [[New Mexico]]. During this, one of Geronimo's men shot and killed Stuart, which consequently led the Confederate Army to all but wipe the Apache tribes out.

==Mormons==

===Taylor, John===
(HFR)

The [[Mormon]] leader '''[[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]]''' takes the opportunity to try to force the United States to recognize the believers' right to [[Mormonism and polygamy|practice]] [[polygamy]]. However, with the use of the new [[Gatling gun]] his rebellion is quickly crushed and he becomes a fugitive, facing death along with the other Mormon leaders if he is caught. The Union army places a price on his head, but he is never captured.

==Canada==

===Borden, Robert===
(GW:AF)

'''[[Robert Borden]]''' becomes [[Prime Minister of Canada]] during the Great War years in both our history and Turtledove's novels. When Canada was ceded to the U.S. after the war, his government was ejected from the occupied territory.

==United Kingdom==

===Churchill, Winston===
(AE:VO, SA:RE-SA:ID)

'''[[Winston Churchill]]''', in this timeline as in the real one, was the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]. He leads his nation into the [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]] on what appears to be a platform of rearmament, restoration of the [[British Empire|British Empire's]] former borders, and a military alliance with France and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] aimed at reversing the [[German Empire|German Empire's]] dominant position in the world.

Although he was a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], his government's actions were strongly influenced by Silver Shirt leader [[Oswald Mosley]], who wielded much greater power and influence in the right-leaning revanchist Britain. In our timeline Mosley's [[British Union of Fascists]] were known as [[Blackshirts]], though Turtledove may be referencing the American fascist group linked to [[Bruno Hauptmann]] and the [[Lindbergh kidnapping|Lindbergh]] Baby case. It is unknown how his half-American heritage has influenced his relationship with the U.S. or whether his mother was still [[Jennie Jerome]], born in the [[Cobble Hill, Brooklyn|Cobble Hill]] section of [[Brooklyn]].

Churchill authorized the British [[atomic bomb|superbomb]] attack on [[Hamburg]], and retaliated to the German superbomb attacks on [[London]], [[Norwich]], and [[Brighton]] by sending a plane with a second superbomb to attack Germany. However, the plane was shot down over Belgium and landed and detonated harmlessly between [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent, Belgium|Ghent]], all but ending Britain's chances to defeat Germany. Churchill was then ousted as Prime Minister in a no-confidence vote, and was succeeded by [[Horace Wilson (civil servant)|Horace Wilson]], who sought a cease-fire with Germany.

===Edward VIII===
(SA:ID)

With relations between the U.S. and the United Kingdom so bad in this timeline, '''[[Edward VIII]]''' never meets [[Wallis Simpson]], and so never abdicates his throne.  He is still the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|king of the United Kingdom]] when [[German Empire|Germany]] drops a [[Nuclear weapon|superbomb]] on [[London]]. Sam Carsten guesses that Edward VIII and his family got out of London even before the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] hit [[Hamburg]], knowing that the Germans would strike back.

===George V===
(AE:BI)
'''[[George V]]''' was the King of the United Kingdom during the Great War. He was the last British monarch to hold a number of titles afforded to the ruler of the [[British Empire]], including the King of Ireland and the [[Monarch of Canada|King of Canada]], both of which he was forced to relinquish by the victorious [[Central Powers]].

During the Great War, he relinquished all German titles and styles on behalf of his relatives who were British subjects; and changed the name of the royal house from [[Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]] to [[House of Windsor|Windsor]]. In the face of the United Kingdom's defeat in 1917, this act was token at best.

[[Jake Featherston]] derisively compared [[Wade Hampton V]] to the British King during the 1921 Confederate States Presidential Election, a somewhat provocative act considering how staunchly Britain had supported the Confederate States.

Upon his death on 20 January 1936 (the date of the death of the historic George V), he was succeeded by his oldest son [[Edward VIII]], who led the United Kingdom to defeat at the hands of the Central Powers in the Second Great War.

===Halifax, Lord===
(SA:ID)

'''[[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]]''' was the British ambassador to the [[Confederate States]] during the Second Great War. He presented to [[C.S. President]] [[Jake Featherston]] materials on the British [[atomic bomb|superbomb]] project, which possibly helped the Confederacy develop their own superbomb.

{{anchor|Lyons, Richard}}

===Lyons, Richard Bickerton Pemell===
(GW:AF)

'''[[Richard Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons|Richard Lyons]]''' was a British diplomat who was sent to Washington after the Battle of Camp Hill to advise [[Abraham Lincoln]] that the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and [[Second French Empire|France]] were set to offer recognition to the Confederate States, and that if the U.S. did not do the same, Britain would defend the C.S. by use of its military. Lord Lyons also envisioned a time where both the U.S. and C.S. would "stand together, [as] a pair of sturdy brothers," which never happened at any point of the Confederacy's independence between 1861 and 1944.

===Mosley, Oswald===
(AE:CCH-AE:VO, SA:ID)

'''[[Oswald Mosley]]''' is the leader of the Silver Shirts, a fascist movement analogous to the [[British Union of Fascists]] (Turtledove conflates two OTL movements: Mosley's historical BUF, also known as the Blackshirts; and the [[Silver Legion of America|Silver Shirts]], an American fascist group linked to [[Bruno Hauptmann]] and the [[Lindbergh kidnapping|Lindbergh Baby case]]). Mosley and several members of the Union gain seats in the British parliament, creating an influential minority. In an attempt to stifle them, the Conservative Party formed a coalition with the Silver Shirts. However, this actually gave more power to the Silver Shirts. The fact that the Conservatives under the leadership of [[Winston Churchill]] had taken a revanchist just insured that the coalition left both parties indistinguishable. Churchill named Mosley [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] to mollify the Silver Shirts. During the later conflict with [[German Empire|Germany]] in 1941, Mosley was also given a position as Minister of War.

Shortly after Germans shot down a British plane carrying the second British superbomb in Belgium in 1944, he was ousted as Chancellor of the Exchequer in a non-confidence vote.

===Victoria===
(HFR)

As in our history, '''[[Queen Victoria|Victoria]]''' was the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen]] of the United Kingdom and the [[British Empire]] from 1837 until her death in 1901.

During her reign, Victoria's Empire intervened twice in North America within 20 years. The first time was in 1862 after the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]] destroyed the [[Army of the Potomac]] and occupied [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], the [[British Empire]] (along with [[Second French Empire|France]]) extended diplomatic recognition to the [[Confederate States]], ending the [[American Civil War|War of Succession]]. The second time was in 1881 when the British Empire once again sided with the Confederacy and [[French Third Republic|France]] against the United States during the [[Second Mexican War]], after both a promise from the Confederacy to [[manumit]] their [[slaves]], and in response to the aggressive behavior from the United States.

===Wilson, Horace===
(SA:ID)

'''[[Horace Wilson (civil servant)|Horace Wilson]]''' became the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] in 1944 in the wake of the ouster of [[Winston Churchill]] in a no-confidence vote. His first act as Prime Minister was to ask [[German Empire|Germany]] for a cease-fire.

==France==

===Duchamp, Marcel===
(GW:AF)

'''[[Marcel Duchamp]]''', in this timeline, is still a famous French artist, but this time his appeal in North America is limited to the upper-crust of the Confederacy. He tried to have an affair with [[Anne Colleton]], who exhibited some of his works at Marshlands [[plantations in the American South|Plantation]]. His works were all removed before [[Marxist]] rebel Cassius and his gang burned the mansion, and Cassius regretted not being able to destroy any Duchamp paintings, which he saw as eyesores.

===Foch, Ferdinand===
(HFR)

'''[[Ferdinand Foch]]''' is a major, the [[Third French Republic|French]] Military Attaché to [[Washington, DC]], at the onset of the Second Mexican War. With his [[German Empire|German]] opposite number [[Alfred von Schlieffen]], and an unnamed British army captain, he accompanies [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hannibal Hamlin]] and Captain Saul Berryman ([[U.S. Army]]) under a flag of truce to the [[Long Bridge (Potomac River)|Long Bridge]] outside Washington D.C. The truce, called by [[C.S. President]] [[James Longstreet]] and C.S. General [[Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson]], is designed to declare Washington D.C. an [[open city]], sparing its destruction.  The Confederate proposal is rejected by Berryman, under the authority of U.S. Commanding General [[William Rosecrans]].  The French and British are declared ''[[personae non gratae]]'' and asked to leave the United States.

===Napoleon III===
(HFR and GW:AF)

'''[[Napoleon III]]''' installed [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] as the [[Emperor of Mexico]] in the 1860s, a move opposed by the United States under the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. His government was hostile to the United States, and in late 1862, during the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]], despite opposition to slavery, Napoleon III extended diplomatic recognition to the [[Confederate States]] and supported [[British Military]] protection over that country, thus beginning an alliance between France and the CS that would continue through the [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]] over eighty years later. This eventually turned out to have been a major strategic blunder for which France paid a heavy price, since it threw the United States into the arms of [[German Empire|Germany]] in a rival alliance which triumphed in both the [[Great War (series)|Great War]] and the Second Great War.

Ultimately, Napoleon was forced to abdicate in 1870 during the disastrous [[Franco-Prussian War]]. He was also the last [[Monarchy of France|Monarch of France]] until King Charles XI under the [[Action Francaise]] party restored the monarchy around 1930.

==Germany==

===Einstein, Albert===
(SA:DE)

'''[[Albert Einstein]]''' is a German physicist who was believed to have been working on an [[atomic bomb]] project in Europe. Along with several other leading German and Austro-Hungarian physicists, Einstein disappeared from public view in 1942. Not long afterwards, the United States, along with [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], were suspected of beginning atomic bomb programs. Since in this world Germany never became [[Nazi]] and there were no persecutions of [[Jews]], he has no problem in contributing to the German war effort, especially as the war begins with Germany being attacked and invaded.

===Guderian, Heinz===
(GW:WH, AE:CCH)

Captain '''[[Heinz Guderian]]''' of the German Imperial Army was an observer attached to Irving Morrell's unit during the 1916 campaign in the [[Canadian Rockies]].  He expressed a more strategic view of the fighting than Major [[Eduard Dietl]], noting that fighting is done for a purpose.  He then displays his great insight into warfare by adding that the point of battle is to get behind the enemy and "smash him up".  (In our timeline, Guderian was one of the masterminds of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]'s [[Blitzkrieg]] tactics, in which the main goal is indeed to get behind the enemy and attack where the enemy is more vulnerable.)  Due to a desire to stay in the field rather than return to a desk position, Guderian stays with Morrell after Major Dietl returns to Austria, and accompanies him back to [[Philadelphia]], during which they meet Luther Bliss and the new Lieutenant Governor of [[Kentucky]].  Guderian makes another appearance, now as a [[lieutenant colonel]], in occupied Canada in 1926, when he shows up in [[Kamloops, British Columbia]], and asks Colonel Morrell for a tour of western Canada.  He is accompanied by his [[aide-de-camp]] [[Adolf Hitler]], whose [[anti-Semitic]] views he does not care for.

{{anchor|Adolf Hitler}}

===Hitler, Adolf===
(AE:CCH)

Because of the [[German Empire]]'s victory in this world, '''[[Adolf Hitler]]''' is a sergeant in the German Army. He holds the [[Iron Cross]], First Class. Morrell met him once as an orderly to Colonel [[Heinz Guderian]], who was on an inspection tour in [[Kamloops, British Columbia]], an occupied territory of the United States. Morrell thought that he was very much like [[Jake Featherston]], but with a hatred for [[Jews]] and [[Slavs]] rather than [[Africans]]. Hitler is never mentioned by name in CCH, but the author has acknowledged his identity. (See also Turtledove's short story "Uncle Alf" in the anthology ''Alternate Generals II'', narrated by a similar version of Hitler.)

===Marx, Karl===
(HFR-AE:CCH)

'''Karl Marx''' was greatly admired by former [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]]. However, Lincoln did not agree with Marx's belief in violent revolution, and steered the [[Socialist Party of the United States]] towards change through the ballot, rather than the bullet at the party's founding 1882.

In the [[Confederate States]], black revolutionaries embraced Marx's call for revolution, staging a revolt during the early years of the [[Great War (series)|Great War]]. While various socialist republics such as the Black Belt Socialist Republic and Congaree Socialist Republic were created, the uprisings were crushed by the C.S. in short order.

===von Schlieffen, Alfred===
(HFR)

'''[[Alfred von Schlieffen]]''' was a [[colonel]] in the German [[army]] working as a military [[attaché]] before and during the Second Mexican War at the German embassy in the United States. His study of [[Robert E. Lee]]'s encirclement of [[Washington, D.C.]] is said to be the inspiration for the [[Schlieffen Plan]] of [[World War I]].

===von Schlözer, Kurd===
(HFR)

'''[[Kurd von Schlözer]]''' remained the [[German Empire]]'s ambassador to the United States as in our timeline. After U.S. President Blaine sued for peace during the Second Mexican War, Schlözer and the German military attaché Alfred von Schlieffen first brought up the idea of an alliance between the United States and the German Empire as a counterpart to the alliance between the United Kingdom, France and the [[Confederate States]], thus forming the foundations for the [[Central Powers]] and breaking the United States' policy of nonintervention in European affairs.

===Wilhelm II, Kaiser===
(GW:AF-AE:VO)

Kaiser '''[[Wilhelm II]]''' was the German Emperor and one of the main allies of the United States in World War I. "Kaiser Bill" was a popular character in the U.S. Many men wore a "Kaiser Bill" mustache in imitation of him. He lived until 1941 (as he did in our timeline), where his death and his son's coming to the throne and refusal to give France its [[Alsace-Lorraine|lost territory]] back started the Second Great War. He was the father of Kaiser [[Crown Prince Wilhelm of Germany|Friedrich Wilhelm V]].

===Wilhelm III, Kaiser===
(AE:VO, SA:RE-ID)

[[Crown Prince Wilhelm of Germany|'''Friedrich Wilhelm''']], Crown Prince of Germany, became Kaiser of the German Empire in 1941, upon the death of his father, [[Wilhelm II]]. He refused to return Alsace-Lorraine to the newly revived Kingdom of France and their British allies, which precipitated the Second Great War in Europe. He authorised the destruction of several targets with superbombs, including [[Petrograd]], [[Paris]] as well as [[London]], [[Norwich]] and [[Brighton]] in a deadly triple strike that crippled Britain into defeat. After the war, he entered into a treaty with the new US President [[Thomas E. Dewey]] to police the world and prevent further development of superbombs.

This character may be the center of a substantial mistake on Turtledove's part. Upon his ascension at the end of [[American Empire: The Victorious Opposition|''The Victorious Opposition'']], he is announced as "Friedrich I of Germany and Friedrich Wilhelm V of Prussia." If this character is indeed the historical figure Wilhelm, Crown Prince of Germany, then he would have reigned as Wilhelm III. While the Crown Prince's first name was Friedrich, even if he chose to call himself that upon his ascension, or, if the character is meant to be the fictional son of Wilhelm II of Germany, he could not have been Friedrich I, but would in fact have been Friedrich IV. There also does not appear to have been a tradition of the German Emperor using a different name in his role as King of Prussia.

As Turtledove only refers to this character as 'the Kaiser' in the ''Settling Accounts'' series, there are no additional clues available to the reader as to the character's identity.

==Austria-Hungary==

===Charles I of Austria===
(SA:G)

'''[[Charles I of Austria]]''' still holds the throne of [[Austria-Hungary]] well into the [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]]. In 1943, he and [[Tsar]] [[Michael II of Russia]] trade public insults as to whose country [[God]] hates more.

Turtledove does not spend much time on the monarchy of Austria-Hungary. Indeed, the only reference to Charles is the one described above. But with Austria victorious at the end of [[World War I]], Charles would not have abdicated as in real history, and so would have avoided dying of [[pneumonia]] in 1922 while living in [[Portugal]].

===Dietl, Eduard===
(GW:WH)

Major '''[[Eduard Dietl]]''' of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] army was an observer attached to [[Irving Morrell|Irving Morrell's]] unit during the 1916 campaign in the [[Canadian Rockies]]. While Turtledove made him an Austro-Hungarian officer, real-life Dietl was a member of the German army.

===Ferdinand, Franz===
(GW:AF)

'''Archduke Franz Ferdinand''' and his wife [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Duchess Sophie]] through [[Sarajevo]] were [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|blown up by an assassin's bomb]] on June 28, 1914. In real history, the Archduke and his wife were assassinated on the same date, but by gunshot after failed attempts to throw bombs into their car. After the assassination, Austria-Hungary issued a number of ultimata against [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], which was supported by [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. Austria-Hungary was in turn supported by [[German Empire|Germany]] and the [[United States]]. Russia invoked its alliances with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]], and the [[Great War (series)|Great War]] began.

Franz Ferdinand's death inspired [[Arthur McGregor]]'s last failed attempt to assassinate [[George Custer|General George Armstrong Custer]] in 1922.

===Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg===
(GW:AF)

'''Duchess Sophie''' and her husband Archduke Franz Ferdinand were [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|killed when a bomb was thrown into their car and exploded]], as they rode through the streets of [[Sarajevo]] on 28 June 28, 1914. This act helped to spark the [[Great War (series)|Great War]].

==Denmark==

===Bohr, Niels===

There is no mention of Denmark taking any part in either of the Great Wars, and it seems to have succeeded in maintaining its neutrality. However, [[Niels Bohr]] is mentioned as having been persuaded by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] to come over to [[German Empire|Germany]] and take part in its [[atomic weapons]] program.

==Russia==

===Michael II, Tsar===
(AE:VO-SA:RE, SA:ID)

'''[[Michael Alexandrovich]]''' is the Grand Duke (and later [[Emperor]]) of [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. With the [[Russian Revolution|Red Russian Revolt]] smashed, and the tsarist government still in control of a post-Great War Russia, "Grand Duke Michael" took the throne as Michael II. He joined [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]] to help his allies in 1941 to wage war against the [[Central Powers]]. He condemned the [[German Empire|German]] [[atomic bomb]] attack on [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], the city of which he had escaped prior to the attack, but later was forced to request an armistice from Germany and to relinquish the throne.

===Molotov, Vyacheslav ("The Hammer")===
(AE:CCH)

Also known as "The Hammer", this is '''[[Vyacheslav Molotov]]''' from our world, another Red holdout (in the failed rebellion) in the [[Volga]] area, trying to defeat the Tsarist forces. By 1941, the Tsarist forces have all but defeated the Red Russians.

===Nicholas II, Tsar===
(GW:AF - GW:B, AE:VO)

In 1914, when [[Austria-Hungary]] issued a number of ultimata to [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] following the assassination of Franz Ferdinand by a Serb in Sarajevo, '''[[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]''' promised to support the Serbs should they refuse the ultimata. They did, and Russia declared war on Austria-Hungary, which had declared war on Serbia. The Great War followed.

In 1917, Nicholas found himself facing a [[Russian Revolution|Red revolution]], followed by a protracted [[Russian Civil War|civil war]], which resulted in Russia backing out of the Great War. Ultimately, Nicholas and his supporters triumphed, and Nicholas remained emperor for the remainder of the 1920s. The destruction resulting from the wars left Russia in such a poor state that in 1929 she was forced to suspend payment of a loan to Austria-Hungary. This caused a chain effect that led in turn to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|worldwide stock market]] crash of that year.

Nicholas was succeeded as Tsar by his younger brother [[Michael Alexandrovich|Michael II]] by the early 1930s.

===Stalin, Joseph===
(AE:CCH)

'''[[Joseph Stalin]]''' is nicknamed "The Man of Steel" in this world. The Red Revolution following the Great War failed and Stalin and the "Hammer" ([[Vyacheslav Molotov]]) became holdouts in the Volga area near the city of [[Volgograd|Tsaritsyn]] which in our timeline was renamed by him as Stalingrad.

==Ottoman Empire==

===Abdul Mejid II===
(AE:CCH)

'''[[Abdul Mejid II]]''' became the [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] sometime after the Great War. He was responsible for continuing the [[Armenian genocide]] through the 1920s. Despite protests from the United States and [[German Empire|Germany]], the Sultan continued the killings until there were few remaining Armenians left in Turkey.

==Ireland==

===Collins, Michael===
(AE:BI)

General '''[[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]''' led a rebellion against the [[British Empire]] during the Great War, supported by the United States and Germany, and became first president of the [[Republic of Ireland]] when this country achieved independence shortly after the war ended. In the early 1920s Collins led the Irish Army against a pro-British Protestant uprising in [[Ulster]] and suppressed it with the help of American and German warships.

==Italy and Vatican City==

===Mussolini, Benito===
(SA:RE)

Although not mentioned by name, Flora Blackford tries to recall the Italian politician who had pledged to make all the trains in his country run on time, but had little public support. The real '''[[Benito Mussolini]]''' claimed to have done this during his rule of [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]]; actually, improvements in the train system predated Mussolini, and the trains were as unpunctual as before.

===Pope Pius XII===
(SA:G)

'''[[Pope Pius XII|Pius XII]]''' was Pope in this timeline as well as ours. He was criticized for not condemning the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] [[genocide]] of [[Armenians]] or the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[pogroms]] against [[Jews]], and it appeared that he likewise did not care about the Freedom Party's killing of the black population of the Confederate States. One character observes that Pius would have spoken out against human rights violations if the group being persecuted consisted mainly of [[Catholic Church|Catholics]]. (Yet this argument is faulty, as the killings were also affecting Catholic Haiti.) The criticism of Pius' failure to condemn human rights violations in this timeline echoes the widely held belief that [[Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust|Pope Pius XII didn't condemn the Holocaust]] in ours.

Given the passage of eight decades between the point of divergence and this part of the story, there's no guarantee that this Pius XII is Eugenio Pacelli, the man who used that numeral in our timeline. For most of history, Popes simply took their regnal names from a fairly short list. However, the plethora of other historical figures in the series suggests that he is the same.

==Mentioned Historical Characters from Before the [[point of divergence|Change]]==

===Adams, John===
'''[[John Adams]]''' served as the second [[President of the United States]]. After the [[How Few Remain|War of Secession]], he and the other Northerner [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] such as [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]] were treated more favorably.

During the 1900s, Adams's portrait was used on the [[United States five-dollar bill|five dollar bill]].

===Brown, John===
(AE:BI)

Following the U.S. defeat in the Second Mexican War, '''[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]''' became a national hero. He was not seen so after the War of Secession. Many towns raised memorials to John Brown because of his attacks on the 'slavocrats' in [[Virginia]] ("He saw the coiled serpent and attacked it!"), particularly in [[Kansas]].

===Calhoun, John Caldwell===
(GW:AF) (SA:G)

Although '''[[John C. Calhoun]]''' died over a decade before the Confederate States was created by the secession of eleven US states in 1860-61, the secession of the CS's founding states was a direct descendant of his nullification doctrine, and Calhoun was therefore seen as a founding father of the Confederacy along with [[Jefferson Davis]], [[Robert E. Lee]], and even [[George Washington]]. His picture appeared on the [[Confederate States dollar|Confederate dollar bill]], for example. Naturally, the U.S. felt differently about Calhoun.

The towns of [[Calhoun, Kentucky]] and [[Calhoun, Georgia]] were named in Calhoun's honor in this timeline. (In our timeline, only the Georgia town was unquestionably named in honor of Calhoun. The Kentucky town [[Calhoun, Kentucky#History|had several names]] before being incorporated in 1852, after Calhoun's OTL death in 1850, as ''Calhoon'', honoring Kentucky congressman [[John Calhoon]]. There is no historic record that definitively states whether the later spelling change to "Calhoun" was specifically in honor of John C. Calhoun.)

===Franklin, Benjamin===
As a [[Pennsylvania|Pennsylvanian man]], '''[[Benjamin Franklin]]''' remained a favorite Founding Father after the War of Secession along with [[John Adams]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]]. A profile of Franklin's face was printed on stamps issued in American Occupied Canada after the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]].

[[Flora Hamburger]] once quoted Franklin's warning "Those who would trade essential liberty for a little temporary security deserve neither liberty nor security" in a floor debate in the House of Representatives—which incidentally met in [[Independence Hall]].

Former president [[Abraham Lincoln]] also quoted Franklin to his host when he visited [[Salt Lake City]] in 1881.

===Jefferson, Thomas===
'''[[Thomas Jefferson]]''' was the third [[President of the United States]]. Following the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]], Thomas Jefferson's status as a [[Virginia]]n (and more substantively, his insistence on a weak central government) tarnished his memory considerably in the United States. Northern Founding Fathers such as [[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[Alexander Hamilton]] were viewed much more favorably.

===Madison, James===
(SA:ID)

Despite his contributions to the [[Federalist paper]]s with [[Alexander Hamilton]], '''[[James Madison]]''' later developed anti-Federalist sentiments and allied himself with Hamilton's archrival, [[Thomas Jefferson]]. For this reason as well as his Virginian heritage, Madison was generally remembered unfavorably in the version of US history advanced under the Remembrance tradition.

In 1944, many in the U.S. presumed that Cassius Madison, the man who killed [[Jake Featherston]], had taken his surname name to honor the fourth President. In fact Cassius had taken the surname from the [[Madison, Georgia|Georgia town]] nearest to where he'd gunned Featherston down. He had never even heard of President Madison before his tour of the U.S.

===Monroe, James===
(HFR)

Despite being from [[Virginia]] (a trait which other presidents and [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] such as [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]], and even [[George Washington]] to being remembered in a mixed or negative light by US historians after the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]]), '''[[James Monroe]]''' was looked on kindly in US history books for his attempt to promote U.S. security and international prestige with the [[Monroe Doctrine]]—a doctrine which was eviscerated in 1862 when, thanks to the Confederate States, the U.S. was powerless to prevent [[Second French Empire|France]] from installing [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] as the [[Emperor of Mexico]].

===Napoleon===
(HFR)

'''[[Napoleon]]''' had been a military genius, achieving an almost mythological stature in the eyes of the world. All those who were masters on the battlefield were often compared to him. He was also an uncle of [[Napoleon III]] who, in turn, was the Emperor of [[Second French Empire|France]] from 1852 to 1870.

Only in [[German Empire|Germany]] was he not admired as his victory over [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] was remembered. In the aftermath of France's defeat in the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]], this made him even more of a hero to the people of France.

During his youth, US President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] counted Napoleon as one of his personal heroes, along with [[George Washington]] and [[Zachary Taylor]].

In 1881, [[Alfred von Schlieffen]] noted that Kaiser [[Wilhelm I]] was one of the last surviving men to have fought under Napoleon during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

===Polk, James Knox===
(SA:ID)

'''[[James Knox Polk]]''' had served as the eleventh President of the United States. He was born in what became [[Pineville, North Carolina]]. A monument erected on the spot of his birth was site of the 1944 meeting between U.S. General [[Irving Morrell]] and [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Don Partridge]] at which Partridge signed away Confederate sovereignty and ended the [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]]. Both men deemed it a fit location for the meeting because Polk had been President before the United States was divided by the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]].

===Taylor, Zachary===
(HFR)

Despite his southern roots, '''[[Zachary Taylor]]''' was appreciated in the United States for his military success during the [[Mexican–American War|First Mexican War]] (the last which the United States would see until the [[Great War (series)|Great War]]).

In his youth, Theodore Roosevelt was a great admirer of Taylor's, viewing him as a conqueror and leader ranking with [[George Washington]] and [[Napoleon]].

===Washington, George===
As a military hero and the first President of the United States, '''[[George Washington]]''' was universally revered as a major Founding Father and one of the most memorable presidents in American history. Also after it broke into two mutually antagonistic nations, U.S. historians continued to so regard Washington, alongside Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt as the most memorable of presidents.

Before 1920, the Confederacy esteemed Washington as a Founding Father, but generally preferred their own founding fathers such as [[John C. Calhoun]], [[Jefferson Davis]], and [[Robert E. Lee]]. In 1914, then-President [[Woodrow Wilson]] invoked George Washington in his speech asking for Congress for a declaration of war against the U.S. while speaking in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].

In the Union, however, Washington was remembered on mixed terms. The general public did not always remember kindly. Washington came from [[Virginia]], and after the War of Secession his popularity in the U.S. suffered because of it - as did that of Thomas Jefferson and [[James Madison]]. Northern people in general preferred to remember Northern Founding Fathers such as John Adams, Alexander Hamilton and Benjamin Franklin (whose picture appeared on stamps issued by the U.S. occupation authorities in Canada). Despite this, the U.S. Government would rebuild the [[Washington Monument]] after it was destroyed during the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]]. As a young man, Theodore Roosevelt admired Washington as a great leader along with [[Zachary Taylor]] and [[Napoleon]].

The Freedom Party in its earliest phase, while still under [[Anthony Dresser]], used George Washington's picture as an emblem, with the slogan "We need a New Revolution". [[Jake Featherston]], who considered Washington to have "sold out the South to the damnyankees" stopped that custom when he took over the party. Many Confederates did view Washington with some suspicion in the years after the Great War, but still thought of him as a Virginian first, and President of the United States second. Washington University in [[Lexington, Virginia]], home of the Confederacy's effort to build a [[Nuclear bomb|superbomb]], retained its name, and the statue of Washington that stood in Richmond survived both Great Wars.

===Webster, Daniel===
(GW:B)

As a northern abolitionist, '''[[Daniel Webster]]''' became a hero to the United States during the Remembrance era between the [[Second Mexican War]] and the [[Great War (series)|Great War]]. His image was on the [[Quarter (United States coin)|U.S. quarter]]. In the Confederate States, he was vilified for thwarting the interests of the ante-bellum South.

&lt;!-- Image with questionable fair-use claim removed: [[File:IPTA.jpg|right|frame|Stamp honouring IPTA]] --&gt;
'''Indian People’s Theatre Association''' ('''IPTA''') is the oldest association of theatre-artists in [[India]]. IPTA was formed in 1943 [[British Raj|pre independence India]], during which it promoted themes related to the [[Indian freedom struggle]]. Its goal was to bring cultural awakening among the people of India.&lt;ref&gt;Bengali Theatre and Performing Arts. Article in [http://www.bangla-online.info/BanglaLanguage/BengaliTheatrePerformanceArts.htm Bangla-online.info]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the cultural wing of the [[Communist Party of India]].&lt;ref name="LoweLloyd1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lisa Lowe|author2=David Lloyd|title=The Politics of Culture in the Shadow of Capital|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UKzABvKz-gAC&amp;pg=PA454|accessdate=16 December 2012|date=27 October 1997|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-2046-3|pages=454–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning==
Banglore unit of IPTA was formed in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198601746.001.0001/acref-9780198601746-e-1898|title=Indian People's Theatre Association - Oxford Reference|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780198601746.001.0001/acref-9780198601746-e-1898|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; IPTA was formed on 25 May 1943 at the National conference of theater artists held at the Marwari school, [[Bombay]] in response to the need for theater artists to become part of the Indian freedom struggle. Its origins lay in the first Progressive Writer’s Association Conference that was held in 1936, the establishment of the Youth Cultural Institute at Calcutta in 1940, and the setting up of the People’s Theatre in Bangalore by Anil De’ Silva in 1941. Its initial members consisted of various progressive cultural troupes, theatre groups and other progressive cultural activists. The name People’s Theatre was suggested by the renowned scientist Homi Jahangir Bhabha who was in turn inspired by Romain Rolland’s book on the concepts of People’s Theatre.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |title=About IPTA and its history |url=http://www.iptaindia.in/about/ | publisher=IPTA |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its initial activities included street plays organized by Binoy Roy of the Bengal Cultural Squad to inform people of the 1942 manmade famine in Bengal. Their ski included a choir ‘Bhookha Hai Bengal’ created by Vamik Jaunpuri and other songs and plays. The squad included musician Prem Dhawan , drum player Dashrath Lal, singer Reva Roy and actress Usha Dutt. Motivated by this squad, several other cultural groups were formed including the Agra Cultural Squad. IPTA was subsequently formed to organize these local groups at the national level.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; 

Ideologically these groups were inspired by the left movement and the then General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, P.C. Joshi and the General Secrtetary of the Progressive Writers’ Association Sajjad Zaheer.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

==initial Members==
Some of the initial members of the group were [[Prithviraj Kapoor]], [[Bijon Bhattacharya]], [[Balraj Sahni]], [[Ritwik Ghatak]], [[Utpal Dutt]], [[Khwaja Ahmad Abbas]], [[Salil Chowdhury]], Pandit [[Ravi Shankar]], Jyotirindra Moitra, [[Niranjan Singh Maan]], [[S. Tera Singh Chan]], [[Jagdish Faryadi]], [[Khalili Faryadi]], [[Rajendra Raghuvanshi]] Safdar Mir, Hasan Premani,Amiya Bose etc. The group was formed in 1942, in the background of the [[Second World War]], with [[Bengal famine of 1943]] and starvation deaths in India on the one hand and repression by the colonial masters in the wake of the [[Quit India Movement]] and the aggression by the fascist powers on the [[Soviet Union]] on the other. An All India People's Theatre Conference was held in [[Mumbai]] in 1943 where the group presented its idea and objective of representing the crisis of the time through the medium of theatre and to help people understand their rights and duties. This conference led to the formation of committees of IPTA across India. The movement hit not only theatres, but also cinema and music in Indian languages.Now it is the cultural wing of Communist Party of India (CPI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Constitution of IPTA |url=http://www.iptaindia.in/about/constitution-of-ipta/ | publisher=IPTA |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Nabanna''==
{{Main|Nabanna (play)}}
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Shobha sen in nabanna.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shobha Sen]] in ''[[Nabanna]]'', 1944]] --&gt;
The most important of the dramas were ''[[Nabanna (play)|Nabanna]]'' (Harvest). ''Nabanna'' is a folk-cultural festival of [[Bengal]] to celebrate the harvest. This [[Bengali language|Bengali]] drama, written by Bijon Bhattacharya and directed by [[Sombhu Mitra]], portrayed the evils of the [[Bengal famine of 1943]]

==Other dramas and films==
''Nava Jiboner Gaan'' (Song of New  Life) by [[Jyotirindra Moitra]] and the film ''[[Dharti Ke Lal]]'' (Children of the Earth) by [[Khwaja Ahmad Abbas]] followed ''Nabanna'' in addressing the needs of the people. These performances were characteristic for their vivid, stark portrayal of the suffering of the masses. Similar productions were carried out all over India, like ''Deshasathi'' in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] which was about the attack on the Soviet Union by [[Nazi]] [[Germany]]; ''Prarambham'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]]; and ''Zubeida'' directed by [[Balraj Sahni]] and based on the story of a Muslim girl from [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]]. [[Manikuntala Sen]], the fire band woman of left politics acted in this play along with [[Gopal Halder]], who later became an educationist.

[[File:Muktibodh Rashtriya Natya Samaroh.jpg|thumb|Natya Samaroh by IPTA, Chhattisgarh, India]]

==Break up and legacy==
Though the group was temporarily dispersed by the [[Indian National Congress]] government using police violence and repressive measures in 1947, its main members continued to carry the legacy of IPTA by forming several groups with similar ideology. Ahindra Chowdhuri, [[Sombhu Mitra]] and [[Tripti Mitra]] were the leading members of the group ''Bohurupee''. ''Raktakarabi'', ''Tahar Nam Ti Ranjana'', ''Char Adhyay'' (written by [[Rabindranath Tagore]]) were some of the earlier productions of Bohurupee. Utpal Dutt led another faction of artists and went to create classics like ''Tiner Talowar'' and ''Kallol''. '''IPTA Mumbai''' was another offshoot that has existed over the last six decades and continue to produce dramas till date.&lt;ref&gt;Indian People's Theatre Association. [http://www.mumbaitheatreguide.com/dramas/groups/ipta.asp Article in mumbaitheatreguide.com]&lt;/ref&gt; IPTA offshoots exist in other parts of India as well.&lt;ref&gt;Suhrid Sankar Chattopadhyay. [http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2213/stories/20050701001708800.htm A stage for social commitment]. Frontline. Volume 22, Issue 13, June18 - July01, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Group theaters like ''[[Nandikar]]'', ''Spandan'' of Kolkata still produce their dramas often in the line of the IPTA movement, and recently there has been effort to start a similar movement inspired by the IPTA.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Peoples Theatre Association revival by [http://www.spandanipta.com/about.html Spandan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Delhi-based theatre company [[Jana Natya Manch]], best known for its street theatre, also emerged from the IPTA in 1973. Noted film director, [[Ritwik Ghatak]] made a Bengali film, ''[[Komal Gandhar]]'' (1961) set around IPTA theatre group.

There are many groups which were regionally floated and still continue the legacy of IPTA both Pre and Post independence. Some of the groups which have grown to be biggest of theater groups in India.

Few Prominent ones are: [[Praja natya mandali]] - Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, Samudaaya in Karnataka.

==IPTA in West Bengal==

IPTA Raigarh was established in 1982 during the first state conference of IPTA which was organized by the Raigarh unit in 1982. Since then Raigarh unit has been active and practicing theatre in this small district of [[Chhattisgarh]] (earlier [[Madhya Pradesh]]).

In 1994, when the Golden Jubilee of IPTA was celebrated nationwide, this unit decided to celebrate the Golden Jubilee by organizing a five-day theatre festival during the month of December. Although meant to be a one-off event, it was very well received and later on, it was decided to continue this as an annual event. This is how the National Theatre Festival was born and conceived.

The same year IPTA was reorganized and it spread its activities, started imparting training and updating artists by means of organizing theatre workshops every year for youth as well as for children. Since 1995, theatre stalwarts like [[Arun Pandey]], [[Sanjay Upadhyay]], [[Suman Kumar]], [[Gautam Mazumdar]], [[Devendra Raj Ankur]], [[Ranjeet Kapoor]], [[Akhilesh Khanna]], [[Neeraj Wahal]], [[Praveen Gunjan]] &amp; [[Anjana Puri]] have conducted workshops and trained our artists.

Besides organizing theatre workshops and festivals, IPTA Raigarh started participating in various festivals to showcase their productions in different cities like Delhi, Allahabad, Jabalpur, Raipur, Aurangabad, Bhopal, Patna, Gaya, Sagar, Ratlam among the few.

In 2001, IPTA Raigarh registered itself as ‘IPTA Center for Cultural Resources and Training’ with the Registrar of firms &amp; societies, Government of India.

"IPTA Center for cultural resources &amp; training" has emerged as one of the pro-active theatre groups in [[Chhattisgarh]] State.

Artistes of the group, including child artistes, have acted in a film "Chutakan Ki Mahabharat" produced by Children’s Film Society Of India and Directed by [[Sankalp Meshram]], which won the National Award for the Best Children’s Film in 2005, conferred by the Government of India.

IPTA Raigarh also publishes its annual Magazine "Rankarm" which is endorsed by Kendriya Hindi Nideshalaya and is being distributed throughout the country with the help of the same. This magazine has been published annually since 2003.

==Punjab==
The Indian People`s Theatre Association (IPTA) movement in Punjab greatly altered the theatre as it was reoriented toward playing a greater role as an instrument of social change. The IPTA movement in Punjab brought out artists like Shiela Bhatia, [[Balraj Sahni]], [[Balwant Gargi]], Niranjan Singh Maan[[Tera Singh Chan]], [[Joginder Bahrla]], [[Pandit Khalili]], the Theatre workers, [[Parkash Kaur]], her younger sister [[Surinder Kaur]], and Amarjit Gurdaspuri the famous folk singers in the service of people's concerns. They made serious efforts to take Punjabi theatre and folk culture to the masses.

&lt;!-- NO ADVERTISEMENTS, IF NOTABLE PLEASE CREATE A SEPARATE ARTICLE *[['''ifta''' (INSTITUTE OF FACTUAL THEATRE ARTS) Institute of Factual Theatre Arts is a well-known entertainment groups and working in this particular field since 1998. In the Mainstream Proscenium the group is working sincerely. But it has not restricted its limits only at proscenium theatre but street theatre, intimate theatre, poster drama and other theatre forms. The experimentation continued to yield the excellence reflecting in the increasing popularity of production as well as the group.
In one hand it was increasing its social work on the country the mainstream using was on full swing. The group premiered ‘KI-KAN-DO’ a satire drama at Rabindra Sadan in 2002. Then in 2003 it launched ‘RITU SUKHE BIBARNO KAVITA’ conflict between libido crisis and continuous transformation of the conjugal life. On 2003 another short play ‘MAA’, inspired from ‘Mother’ by Maxim Gorky was staged. In 2004 it has launched its first bi-lingual production ‘Chitrangada’, a mythological journey of metamorphosis, inspired from Tagore’s dance drama ‘Chitrangada’. For the first time from the drawing room pattern, the director tried to explore a new form. Live music, Folk Elements, Martial Art, Chhou (known folk form) and songs of Tagore was used to design the drama. The novelty and musical format earn the invitation in two consecutive “National Youth Festival” of 2005 and 2006. The production won ‘gold’ in 2005. Now it is working in its new production “Sacrifice”, premiered at Rabindra Sadan on 6th March 2007. --&gt;

'''Lisa Telford''' (born in [[Ketchikan, Alaska]]) is a Git’ans Git’anee [[Haida people|Haida]] weaver who creates contemporary garments, shoes and other objects using [[Textile arts of indigenous peoples of the Americas#Northwest coast|Northwest Coast style weaving techniques]]. Her work serves as a commentary on Native identity, stereotypes and fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nativeartsandcultures.org/lisa-telford|title=Native Art and Cultures Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her baskets may be seen in the collections of [[Oregon Historical Society|The Oregon Historical Society]], [[Hallie Ford Museum of Art]], the [[National Museum of the American Indian|Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian]], the [[Heard Museum]], the [[Portland Art Museum]], the [[Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture|Burke Museum]] and at [[Stonington Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://artisttrust.org/index.php/award-winners/artist-profile/lisa_telford|title=Artist Trust|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stoningtongallery.com/artist/lisa-telford/#current|title=Lisa Telford - Stonington Gallery|work=Stonington Gallery|access-date=2018-09-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training ==
Telford comes from a long line of weavers including her grandmother, mother, aunt and cousins.&lt;ref name="Stonington Gallery"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stoningtongallery.com/artist/lisa-telford/#bio|title=Stonington Gallery|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her Indiana upbringing, she grew up connected to her culture, visiting Alaska for traditional gatherings and potlatches and participating in traditional dance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/lisa-telford-celebrating-the-beauty-of-nature/|title=Lisa Telford: Celebrating the Beauty of Nature|last=Walker|first=Richard|date=April 27, 2011|work=Indian Country Today|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 16 years Telford worked as a carpenter. In 1996, she took a position as a job developer with a nonprofit organization called ANEW — Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Employment for Women and Men.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/native-artist-low-profile-here-big-elsewhere/|title=Native artist low-profile here, big elsewhere|last=Wright|first=Diane|date=September 13, 2006|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 35, she began learning to weave traditional [[Haida people|Haida]] baskets from her aunt, [[Delores Churchill]], and traditional cedar garments from her cousin, Holly Churchill.

== Creative process ==
Telford stuck strictly to the tradition of form follows function until 2004 when she went into contemporary cedar clothing, cedar shoes, cowboy boots and neckties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://imndn.org/artwork/3880704-Lisa-Telford-Too-Haida.html|title=Woven: The Art of Contemporary Native Basketry|last=|first=|date=|website=IMNDN|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telford tells of her work:&lt;blockquote&gt;I harvest and prepare my own material, using red &amp; yellow cedar bark and spruce root in my work. Harvesting cedar bark takes me hundreds of miles from home and many hours of preparation time. Materials are prepared differently depending on the final product. The bark is traditionally stored for one year and then further processing is required before weaving may start.&lt;ref name="Stonington Gallery"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;After that, baskets can take Telford five to 200 hours to make.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As a young weaver she once sat down and counted every stitch on one of her grandmother’s old baskets. "At first my basketry had to be perfect, and then I let it all go and that’s when I found true joy".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The artist compares making baskets to therapy, saying it helps her relax from the stresses of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nmai.si.edu/exhibitions/baskets/subpage.cfm?subpage=view_lisa|title=The language of Native American Baskets from the Weaver's View|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also called basketry her thread to sanity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Collaborations ==

In 2011, Telford worked with glass artist [[Preston Singletary]] on an exhibition of women’s forms in glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nativeartsandcultures.org/lisa-telford|title=Native Arts and Cultures Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2011, Telford received in the National Native Artist Exchange Grant to work with [[Kelly Church]]. She taught Kelly how to find and choose the proper cedar tree for harvesting, how to split and prepare the bark to be stored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nefa.org/grantees/lisa-telford|title=Lisa Telford - Grant Recipient|last=|first=|date=|website=New England Foundation for the Arts|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11824">The '''list of Dan Dare stories''' details appearances of the character [[Dan Dare]], created by [[Frank Hampson]].

==The original ''Eagle'' comic==

These are the '''Dan Dare stories''' that appeared in the original [[Eagle (comic)|Eagle Comic]], which ran from 1950 to 1969 and featured the hero [[Dan Dare]]. The stories would often take place as parts of longer story arcs, and when this happened the stories are grouped together as such.  These storylines were reprinted by Hawk Books in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and as of May, 2009, the first ten stories have been reprinted again by [[Titan Books]].  The series of twelve hardbacks, each about 100 pages, splits ''Voyage to Venus'' and ''Operation Saturn'' across two volumes each.  After a brief hiatus, the following two stories, 'Man From Nowhere' and 'Rogue Planet' were released in 2008, with ''The Phantom Fleet'' and ''Safari in Space'' continuing publication into 2009..

Three stories (''Man From Nowhere'', ''Rogue Planet'', ''Reign of the Robots'') were reproduced in the early 1980s by [[Dragon's Dream]].  The first of these books was particularly notable because the front page panel with the Eagle logo was replaced with new artwork drawn by Dan Dare's creator [[Frank Hampson]].

''The original Eagle's run then came to an end when it was merged with the [[Lion (comic)|Lion Comic]].''

==2000AD==

Between 1977 and 1981 the Dan Dare character was revived to appear in the new [[2000 AD (comics)|2000AD]] comic. For the first 45 progs (issues) of the comic, "Dan Dare" was considered to be the "lead" strip, and hence held the coveted centre-spread position, thus allowing the first two pages of the strip to be printed in colour. From prog 46 to prog 58, Dare was moved to the front cover, a move that not only allowed the fan favourite [[Judge Dredd]] to take the centre spread, but which also meant that by dispensing with the traditional single-image cover, the comic could effectively have an extra page of content.

Conclusion of 'Servant of Evil' story arc

==The relaunched ''Eagle'' comic==

In 1982 Eagle was re-launched, with Dan Dare once again its flagship strip. The new character was the great-great-grandson of the original, with the only other surviving original character being the Mekon, although a descendent of Digby was later introduced.

*''Return of the Mekon'' issues 1-33

==Revolver==
In 1990, a strip entitled ''Dare'', written by [[Grant Morrison]] and drawn by [[Rian Hughes]], was serialized in ''[[Revolver Comic (UK)|Revolver]]''. It presented bleak and cynical characters and was a not-too-subtle satire of 1980s [[British politics]]. Spacefleet had been privatised, the Treens were subjected to racist abuse in urban ghettos, Digby was unemployed, Professor Peabody committed suicide, and Dare's mentor Sir Hubert Guest betrayed Dare to [[the Mekon]] and his quisling British Prime Minister, Gloria Munday (whose appearance and demeanour appear modelled on [[Margaret Thatcher]].) Ultimately, Dare destroys London, the Mekon and himself through a smuggled nuclear weapon.

==The Planet==
In 1996, ''The Planet'' published its first and only issue. Inside was a new and unfinished Dan Dare story, "Remembrance", drawn by [[Sydney Jordan]] featuring a slightly older Dare and apparently set some years after the original Eagle strips.

==Virgin Comics==
In 2008 [[Virgin Comics]] published a 7 issue Dan Dare [[mini-series]] written by [[Garth Ennis]], with art by [[Gary Erskine]]. The series is set several years after the original strips. Space Fleet has collapsed along with the UN due to nuclear war between China and America; Britain survived due to defensive shields made by Professor Peabody, and has become a world power again as a result with the [[Royal Navy]] taking Space Fleet's role. Peabody is the [[Home Secretary]] to a [[Prime Minister]] modelled on [[Tony Blair]], who has sold [[Earth]]'s defence out to [[The Mekon]] out of fear of overwhelming odds. Dare, assisted by Digby (who sacrifices himself in battle) leads a spirited defence of both Earth and his honourable principles.

A '''luckenbooth brooch''' is a Scottish heart-shaped [[brooch]]. These brooches often have a crown above one heart, or two intertwined hearts. They are typically made of silver and may be engraved or set with stones. 	[[File:Luckenbooth brooches .jpg|thumb|Scottish luckenbooth brooches 18th to 20th centuries]]

The name comes from the '''[[luckenbooths]]''' of [[Edinburgh]] where jewellery and trinkets used to be sold, including this type of brooch.&lt;ref name="Paton"&gt;James Paton, ''Scottish History and Life'', Maclehose 1902&lt;/ref&gt;
Luckenbooth is a [[Scots language|Scots]] word for a lockable stall or workshop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/dsl/getent4.php?xref=yes&amp;searchtype=full&amp;dregion=form&amp;dtext=all&amp;sset=1&amp;fset=20&amp;query=Lukkin-buthis Dictionary of the Scots Language: Lukkin-buthis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307094957/http://www.dsl.ac.uk/dsl/getent4.php?xref=yes&amp;searchtype=full&amp;dregion=form&amp;dtext=all&amp;sset=1&amp;fset=20&amp;query=Lukkin-buthis |date=7 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Edinburgh booths were situated on the [[Royal Mile]] near [[St Giles Cathedral]]. They were the city's first permanent shops, going back to the 15th century, and initially housing mainly silversmiths and goldsmiths. They were demolished in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edinburgh-royalmile.com/history/the-luckenbooths.html History of the Royal Mile: Luckenbooths]&lt;/ref&gt;

The luckenbooth brooch is a [[traditional]] [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[love token]]:&lt;ref name="Paton"/&gt; often given as a [[betrothal]] or [[wedding]] [[brooch]]. It might be worn by a [[Breastfeeding|nursing]] mother as a charm to help her milk flow,&lt;ref name="Paton"/&gt; and/or be pinned to a [[Infant clothing|baby's clothing]] to protect it from harm. It was known as a witch-brooch by people using it to save children from the [[evil eye]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120709133215/http://images.vam.ac.uk/item/O113816/brooch/ Victoria and Albert Museum: Scottish silver heart brooch]&lt;/ref&gt;

The luckenbooth brooch has [[motif (visual arts)|motif]]s similar to the [[Claddagh ring]], also using the [[heart]] and [[The Crown|crown]]. Heart-shaped brooches in parts of Europe date back to late [[medieval]] times, but this design probably did not appear in Scotland before the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Calder"&gt;Jenni Calder, ''The Wealth of a Nation'', National Museums of Scotland, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Anker, ''European Folk Art in Europe and the Americas'', McGraw-Hill, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

Silver was the usual material,&lt;ref name="Paton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calder"/&gt; although gold heart brooches were made for wealthy people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.vam.ac.uk/item/O113811/ring-brooch/ Victoria and Albert Museum: Scottish gold heart brooch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810090744/http://images.vam.ac.uk/item/O113811/ring-brooch/ |date=10 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver was commonly chosen for "lucky" charms, and was also an affordable metal for jewellery that was popular with poorer people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quezi.com/12874 Can a luckenbooth brooch have a heart but no crown?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405080128/http://quezi.com/12874 |date=5 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inexpensive glass paste "gems" were sometimes used on silver luckenbooth brooches, as were [[garnet]]s and semi-precious stones.&lt;ref name="Calder"/&gt; Some brooches were engraved with initials, dates or mottoes.&lt;ref name="Paton"/&gt;

By the mid 18th century luckenbooth tokens also featured heavily as trade [[silver]] items to the [[indigenous peoples of the Eastern Woodlands]], particularly the [[Iroquois]] of the [[Iroquois Confederacy|Six Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://heritage.scotsman.com/scotsincanada/Brooches-for-barter.2619605.jp Brooches for barter]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, luckenbooth brooches also became a common decorative symbol in 18th and early 19th century [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native]] clothing.

One legend of the luckenbooth brooch is that it was a symbol of love and devotion given by [[Mary Queen of Scots]] to [[Lord Darnley]]. Another story is that it was an engagement brooch given to her by the [[Francis II of France|Dauphin of France]] whom she later married. It may feature Scottish motifs like the [[saltire|St. Andrew's Cross]], or the thistle. 

The Luckenbooth brooch has been a self-consciously Scottish form of jewellery since the 19th century. The form was adapted to pebble jewellery in Victorian times, as well as being a regular feature in the ranges of most Scottish manufacturing jewellers who worked for the Highland outfitter and tourist trades. &lt;ref name="Stephen Walker"&gt; Stephen Walker (2013.)

'''Maria Sibylla Merian''' (2 April 1647{{spaced ndash}}13 January 1717&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Maria Sibylla Merian |first=Kara |last=Rogers |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Maria-Sibylla-Merian}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[German people|German]]-born [[naturalist]] and scientific [[illustrator]], a descendant of the [[Frankfurt]] branch of the Swiss [[Merian family]]. Merian was one of the first naturalists to observe insects directly.

Merian received her artistic training from her stepfather, [[Jacob Marrel]], a student of the [[still life]] painter [[Georg Flegel]]. Merian published her first book of natural illustrations in 1675. She had started to collect insects as an adolescent and at age thirteen she raised [[silk worms]]. In 1679 Merian published the first volume of a two-volume series on [[caterpillars]], the second volume followed in 1683. Each volume contained 50 plates engraved and etched by Merian. Merian documented evidence on the process of metamorphosis and the plant hosts of 186 European insect species. Along with the illustrations Merian included a descriptions of their life cycles.

In 1699 Merian travelled to [[Dutch Surinam]] to study and record the tropical insects. In 1705 she published ''Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium''. Few colour images of the ''New World'' were printed before 1700 and thus Merian's ''Metamorphosis'' has been credited with influencing a range of naturalist illustrators. Because of her careful observations and documentation of the [[metamorphosis]] of the [[butterfly]], she is considered by [[David Attenborough]]&lt;ref&gt;Natural Curiosities film, BBC&lt;/ref&gt; to be among the most significant contributors to the field of [[entomology]]. She was a leading entomologist of her time and she discovered many new facts about insect life through her studies.&lt;ref name="Handbuch4:35"&gt;{{cite book |title=Lepidoptera, moths and butterflies: Evolution, Systematics and Biogeography |last=Kristensen |first=Niels P. |editor= Kristensen, Niels P.|series=Volume 4, Part 35 of Handbuch der Zoologie:Eine Naturgeschichte der Stämme des Tierreiches.

Maria Sibylla Merian's father, the Swiss engraver and publisher [[Matthäus Merian]] the Elder, married her mother, his second wife, Johanna Sybilla Heyne, in 1646. Maria was born within the next year in 1647, making her his 9th child. Her father died in 1650, and in 1651 her mother remarried the flower and [[still life]] painter [[Jacob Marrel]]. Marrel encouraged Merian to draw and paint. While he lived mostly in Holland, his pupil [[Abraham Mignon]] trained her. At the age of thirteen she painted her first images of insects and plants from specimens she had captured.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Headstrong: 52 Women Who Changed Science - And the World|last = Swaby|first = Rachel|publisher = Broadway Books|year = 2015|isbn = 9780553446791|location = New York|pages = 47–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, she had access to many books about [[natural history]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=61875113&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Maria Sibylla Merian (1647-1717): An Early Investigator of Parasitoids and Phenotypic Plasticity|last = Todd|first = Kim|date = June 2011|journal = Terrestrial Arthropod Reviews|doi = 10.1163/187498311X567794|pmid = |access-date = 10 August 2015|volume = 4|issue = 2|pages = 131–144|subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding her youth, in the foreword to ''Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium'', Merian wrote:&lt;ref name="foreword"&gt;Foreword from ''Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium'' (Metamorphosis of the Insects of Surinam)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|I spent my time investigating insects. At the beginning, I started with silk worms in my home town of Frankfurt. I realized that other caterpillars produced beautiful butterflies or moths, and that [[silkworms]] did the same. This led me to collect all the [[caterpillars]] I could find in order to see how they changed.}}

In May 1665, Merian married Marrel's apprentice, Johann Andreas Graff from [[Nuremberg]]; his father was a poet and director of the local high school, one of the leading schools in 17th-century Germany. In January 1668, she had her first child, [[Johanna Helena Herolt|Johanna Helena]], and the family moved to Nuremberg in 1670, her husband's home town. While living there, Merian continued painting, working on parchment and linen, and creating designs for [[embroidery]]. She also gave drawing lessons to unmarried daughters of wealthy families (her "''Jungferncompaney''", i.e. virgin group), which helped her family financially and increased its social standing. This provided her with access to the finest gardens, maintained by the wealthy and elite, where she could continue collecting and documenting insects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1675 Merian was included in [[Joachim von Sandrart]]'s German Academy. Aside from painting flowers she made [[Engraving|copperplate engravings]]. After attending Standrart' school she published flower pattern books.&lt;ref name="Suzanne Le-May Sheffield 2004 24"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science: Social Impact and Interaction|author=Suzanne Le-May Sheffield|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2004|isbn=9781851094608|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1678, she gave birth to her second daughter [[Dorothea Maria Graff|Dorothea Maria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wulf|first1=Andrea|title=The Woman Who Made Science Beautiful|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/01/the-woman-who-made-science-beautiful/424620/|accessdate=19 January 2016|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other women still-life painters, such as Merian's contemporary [[Margaretha de Heer]], included insects in their floral pictures, but did not breed or study them. While women of Merian's day did collect butterflies, the amateur science of naturalism was practiced by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women on the Margins: Three Seventeenth-century Lives|authors=Natalie Zemon Davis|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1995|isbn=9780674955202|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1679 she published her first work on insects, the first of a two-volume illustrated book focusing on insect [[metamorphosis]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1678, the family had moved to [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]], but her marriage was an unhappy one.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She moved in with her mother, after her stepfather died in 1681. In 1683 she traveled to [[Gottorp]] and was attracted to the [[Labadists]] community in [[Holstein]]. In 1685 Merian travelled with her mother, husband and children  to [[Friesland]] where her half-brother Caspar Merian had lived since 1677.

===Friesland===
[[File:CasparM.jpg|thumb|Her brother Caspar Merian]]
From 1685 onwards Merian, her daughters and her mother lived with the Labadist community, who had settled on the grounds of a stately home – Walt(h)a Castle – at [[Wieuwerd]] in Friesland. They stayed there for three years and Merian found the time to study natural history and Latin, the language in which scientific books were written.&lt;ref name="Suzanne Le-May Sheffield 2004 24"/&gt; In the moors of Friesland she observed the birth and development of [[frogs]], and collected them to dissect them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women on the Margins: Three Seventeenth-century Lives|authors=Natalie Zemon Davis|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1995|isbn=9780674955202|pages=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merian stayed with the community until 1691.&lt;ref name="Suzanne Le-May Sheffield 2004 24"/&gt;

In Wieuwerd the Labadists engaged in printing and many other occupations, including farming and milling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cascade1987.nl/schetsplattegrond-van-waltha-of-thetinga-state-opgetekend-door-johann-andreas-graff-echtgenoot-van-maria-sibylla-merian/ Detailson the Waltha or Thetinga estate Drawing and map of the estate by Johann Andreas Graff, Merian's husband]&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak, the [[religious community]] numbered around 600 with many more adherents further afield. Visitors came from England, Italy, Poland and elsewhere, but not all approved of the strict [[discipline]], [[separatism]] and [[community property]].&lt;ref name="Wolfgang Klötzer 1996"&gt;Wolfgang Klötzer (Hrsg.): Frankfurter Biographie.

In 1690, Merian's mother had died. A year later, she moved with her daughters to [[Amsterdam]]. In 1692, her husband divorced her. In Amsterdam the same year, her daughter Johanna married Jakob Hendrik Herolt, a successful merchant on Surinam, originally from [[Bacharach]]. The flower painter [[Rachel Ruysch]] became Merian's pupil.&lt;ref name="Soldiershop Publishing"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Flowers, butterflies, insects, caterpillars and serpents...: From the superb engravings of Sybilla Merian and Moses Hariss|authors=Luca Stefano Cristini|publisher=Soldiershop Publishing|year=2014|isbn=9788896519752|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merian made a living selling her paintings.&lt;ref name="Suzanne Le-May Sheffield 2004 24"/&gt; She and her daughter Johanna sold flower pictures to art collector [[Agnes Block]]. By 1698 Merian lived in a well-furnished house on Kerkstraat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women on the Margins: Three Seventeenth-century Lives|authors=Natalie Zemon Davis|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1995|isbn=9780674955202|pages=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1699, the city of Amsterdam granted Merian permission to travel to [[Suriname]] in South America, along with her younger daughter [[Dorothea Maria Graff|Dorothea Maria]]. On 10 July, the fifty-two year old Merian and her daughter set sail. The goal of the mission was to spend five years illustrating new species of insects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In order to finance the mission, Maria Sibylla sold 255 of her own paintings.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=lfh&amp;AN=32045888&amp;site=ehost-live|title = A Study of Metamorphosis|last = Reidell|first = Heidi|date = April 2008|journal = Americas|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 10 August 2015|volume = 60|issue = 2|pages = 28–35|subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before departing, she wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In [[Holland]], with much astonishment what beautiful animals came from the East and [[West Indies]]. I was blessed with having been able to look at both the expensive collection of Doctor [[Nicolaes Witsen|Nicolaas Witsen]], mayor of Amsterdam and director of the East Indies society, and that of Mr. [[Jonas Witsen]], secretary of Amsterdam. Moreover, I also saw the collections of Mr. [[Frederick Ruysch|Fredericus Ruysch]], doctor of medicine and professor of anatomy and botany, Mr. [[Levinus Vincent|Livinus Vincent]], and many other people. In these collections I had found innumerable other insects, but found that their origin and their reproduction is unknown, it begs the question as to how they transform, starting from caterpillars and chrysalises and so on. All this has, at the same time, led me to undertake a long dreamed of journey to Suriname.&lt;ref name="foreword"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Suriname and return to Netherlands===
Merian arrived on 18/19 September in Surinam,&lt;!--which included what later became known as the [[French Guiana|French]], [[Dutch colonisation of the Guianas|Dutch]] and [[British Guiana]]s,--&gt; and met with the governor [[Paulus van der Veen]]. She worked for two years,&lt;ref name="de Bray 2001, p. 48"&gt;de Bray (2001), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; traveling around the colony and sketching local animals and plants. She recorded local native names for the plants and described local uses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Unlike other Dutch naturalists, Merian was not employed by a commercial enterprise or corporation. But her journey was partly financed by the directors of the [[Dutch West India Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empire of the Senses: Sensory Practices of Colonialism in Early America|authors=Daniela Hacke &amp; Paul Musselwhite|publisher=BRILL|year=2017|isbn= 9789004340640|pages=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her subsequent publication on the expedition Merian criticised the actions of the colonial merchants, saying that "the people there have no desire to investigate anything like that; indeed they mocked me for seeking anything other than sugar in the country." Merian also condemned the merchants’ treatment of slaves. She was given a slave helper for her research and the interaction she could thus have with the Amerindian and African slaves in the colony assisted her in researching the plants and animals of Surinam. Merian also took an interest in agriculture and lamented the colonial merchants' resistance to plant or export anything other than [[sugar]]. She later showcased the vegetables and fruits that could be found in Surinam, including the [[pineapple]].&lt;ref name="BRILL"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empire of the Senses: Sensory Practices of Colonialism in Early America|authors=Daniela Hacke &amp; Paul Musselwhite|publisher=BRILL|year=2017|isbn= 9789004340640|pages=212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1701 [[malaria]] forced her to return to the [[Dutch Republic]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Back in the Netherlands Merian opened a shop. She sold specimens she had collected and engravings of plant and animal life in Suriname. In 1705, she published a book ''Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium'' about the insects of Suriname.&lt;ref name="Handbuch4:35"/&gt;

In 1715, Merian suffered a [[stroke]]. Despite being partially paralysed she continued her work.&lt;ref name="Soldiershop Publishing"/&gt; Maria Sibylla Merian died in Amsterdam on 13 January 1717 and was buried four days later at Leidse kerkhof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/vrouwenlexicon/lemmata/data/Merian|access-date=23 December 2017|title=Merian, Maria Sibylla (1647-1717)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The death register lists her as a [[pauper]].&lt;ref&gt;Pieters, F. F. J. M., &amp; Winthagen, D. (1999).

Archives of Natural History, 26(1), 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Her daughter Dorothea published ''Erucarum Ortus Alimentum et Paradoxa Metamorphosis'', a collection of her mother's work, posthumously.

==Work==
=== Botanical art ===
Merian first made a name for herself as an [[botanical artist]]. In 1675 she started to publish a three volume series, each with 12 plates depicting flowers.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science, 17th Century to Present: Pioneers, Activists and Protagonists|editors=Donna Spalding Andréolle &amp; Veronique Molinari|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443830676|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1680 she published ''Neues Blumenbuch'', combining the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Insect and the Image: Visualizing Nature in Early Modern Europe, 1500-1700|author=Janice Neri|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2011|isbn=9780816667642|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drawings were decorative and not all were drawn based on observation. Some of the flowers in the three-volume series appear to be based on drawings by [[Nicolas Robert]] and her step-father [[Jacob Marrel]]. Merian included insects among the flowers, again she may not have observed them all herself and some may be copies of drawings by [[Jacob Hoefnagel]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge Scholars Publishing"/&gt; The single flowers, wreaths, nosegays and bouquets in the three volumes would provide patterns for artists and embroiderers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women on the Margins: Three Seventeenth-century Lives|author=Natalie Zemon Davis|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1995|isbn=9780674955202|pages=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Embroidery was at the time an essential part of the education that privileged young women received in Europe. Copying from other artists was an essential part of an artists training at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Insect and the Image: Visualizing Nature in Early Modern Europe, 1500-1700|author=Janice Neri|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2011|isbn=9780816667642|pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her compositions resemble the compartment style of the scrolling stem embroidery designs that were common in Europe at the time. Butterflies and [[damselflies]] interplayed with plants, reflecting the decorative compositions of Hoefnagel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Insect and the Image: Visualizing Nature in Early Modern Europe, 1500-1700|author=Janice Neri|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2011|isbn=9780816667642|pages=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her subsequent ''Raupen'' books would also be used at patterns for paintings, drawings and sewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Insect and the Image: Visualizing Nature in Early Modern Europe, 1500-1700|author=Janice Neri|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2011|isbn=9780816667642|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merian also sold hand coloured editions of the Blumenbuch series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Insect and the Image: Visualizing Nature in Early Modern Europe, 1500-1700|author=Janice Neri|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2011|isbn=9780816667642|pages=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merian's process of creating her art used [[vellum]] which she primed with a white coat.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=65564703&amp;site=ehost-live|title = The Vivid Colors of Merian|last = Kopaneva|first = N.P.|date = February 2010|journal = Science First Hand|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 10 August 2015|volume = 25|issue = 1|pages = 110–123|subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the [[guild system]] women were not allowed to paint in [[Oil paint|oil]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Merian painted with [[Watercolor painting|watercolors]] and [[gouache]], instead.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Research into insects and caterpillars ===
[[File:Maria_Sibylla_Merian_Der_Raupen_wunderbare_Verwandelung_und_sonderbare_Blumennahrung_Band_1.png|thumb|right|Title page of ''The Caterpillars' Marvelous Transformation and Strange Floral Food'', first volume, published 1679]]

[[File:Garden_Tiger_Moth_Maria_Sibylla_Merian.png|thumb|right|Plate 5 of ''Caterpillars'' vol 1, depicting the metamorphosis of the [[garden tiger moth]], its plant host, and [[wasp]]s.]]
Merian was one of the first naturalists to observe insects directly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Merian collected and observed live insects and created detailed drawings. In her time insects still had a reputation as "beasts of the devil" and the process of metamorphosis was largely unknown. While a handful of scholars had published empirical information on the [[insect]], [[moth]] and [[butterfly]] life cycle, the widespread contemporary believe was that they were "born of mud" by  [[spontaneous generation]]. Merian documented evidence to the contrary and described the life cycles of 186 insect species.&lt;ref name="Soldiershop Publishing"/&gt;

Merian had started to collect insects as an adolescent and kept a study journal. Aged 13 she raised [[silk worms]] and other insects. Her interest turned to moths and butterflies, which she collected and studied. While living in Nuremberg and Frankfurt Merian would travel to the surrounding countryside to search for [[caterpillar]] [[larvae]]. She recorded their food plants, the timing of their metamorphoses, and noted the behaviour she observed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science, 17th Century to Present: Pioneers, Activists and Protagonists|editors=Donna Spalding Andréolle &amp; Veronique Molinari|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443830676|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not unusual for naturalists to illustrate their own research, but Merian was among the first professionally trained artists to illustrate her lifelong studies and observations.

She observed the life cycles of insects over decades, thus she made detailed drawings based on live insects in their natural environment or freshly preserved specimens. This set her apart from previous artist-naturalists such as [[Conrad Gesner]]. Her drawings and [[Engraving|engraved plates]] depict moths laying eggs, or caterpillars feeding on leaves. By drawing live insects Merian could accurately depict colours, as preserved [[Zoological specimen|specimens]] lose colour. The plates she eventually published are complex compositions. They are based on detailed studies she painted on vellum, many are preserved in her study journal. A comparison shows that she changed little and preserved the posture and colour of insects when placing them into the larger composition of her plates. In the course of her insect studies she also recorded and painted the reproductive cycle of flowers, from bud through fruit. As a trained artist Merian was concerned with colour accuracy and in ''Metamorphosis'' she recorded the plants from which pigments could be derived. The engravings she produced or supervised bear little difference from her original water colours. Some engravings were also hand-coloured by her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science, 17th Century to Present: Pioneers, Activists and Protagonists|editors=Donna Spalding Andréolle &amp; Veronique Molinari|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443830676|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1679 Merian published the first volume of a two-volume series on caterpillars, the second volume followed in 1683. Each volume contained 50 plates engraved and etched by Merian. Along the illustrations Merian included a description of the insects, moths, butterflies and their larvae she had observed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; ''Der Raupen wunderbare Verwandlung und sonderbare Blumennahrung&amp;nbsp;– The Caterpillars' Marvelous Transformation and Strange Floral Food'', was very popular in certain segments of [[aristocracy|high society]] as a result of being published in the [[German language|vernacular]]. However, her work was largely ignored by scientists of the time because the official language of science was still [[Latin]].

The title page of her 1679 ''Caterpillars'' proudly proclaimed in German:
&lt;blockquote&gt; ".....wherein by means of an entirely new invention the origin, food and development of caterpillars, worms, butterflies, moths, flies and other such little animals, including times, places and characteristics, for naturalists, artists, and gardeners, are diligently examined, briefly described, painted from nature, engraved in copper and published independently." &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science, 17th Century to Present: Pioneers, Activists and Protagonists|editors=Donna Spalding Andréolle &amp; Veronique Molinari|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443830676|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jan Goedart]] had described and depicted the life stages of European moths and butterflies before her, but Merian's "invention" was the detailed study of species, their life-cycle and [[habitat]]. Goedart had documented species by depicting one adult, a pupa and one larvae. Merian depicted the physical differences between male and female adults, showed wings in different positions and the different colouring on each side of the wing. She also documented the extended proboscis of feeding insects. The first plate in her 1679 ''Caterpillars'' detailed the life cycle of the [[silkworm moth]]. Starting in the right-hand corner with eggs, progressing with a hatching larva and several moults of the growing larvae.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Goedart had not included eggs in his images of the life stages of European moths and butterflies, because he had believed that caterpillars were generated from water. When Merian published her study of insects it was still widely believed that insects were spontaneously generated. Merian's discoveries were made independently and supported the findings of [[Francesco Redi]], [[Marcello Malpighi]] and [[Jan Swammerdam]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science, 17th Century to Present: Pioneers, Activists and Protagonists|editors=Donna Spalding Andréolle &amp; Veronique Molinari|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443830676|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Merian's depiction of insects' life cycle was innovative in its accuracy, it was her observations on the interaction of organisms that became her major contribution to the emerging field of [[ecological study|ecological studies]]. The depiction of insects and their plant hosts not only set Merian's work apart from that of the classic by Swammerdam and [[Francis Willughby]], but also the work of her countrymen and contemporaries such as [[Georg Rumphius]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Merian was the first to show that each stage of the change from caterpillar to butterfly depended on a small number of plants for its nourishment. She noted that as a consequence, the eggs were laid near these plants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In her description she commented on the environmental factors that influenced the growth of insects. On caterpillars she noted that the size of their larvae increased by the day if they had enough food. "Some then attain their full size in several weeks: others can require up to two months." &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Among her most significant contribution to science is the pairing of each larval lepidopteran, which she observed with a plant on which it feeds. She collected and kept caterpillars and conducted experiments to confirm her observations. She noted "caterpillars which fed on one flowering plant only, would feed on that one alone, and soon died if I did not provide it for them." She documented that some caterpillars would feed on more than one plant, but some only did so if they were deprived of their preferred host plant. Eventually the importance of the plant-host association was recognised and in the early taxonomy of moths and butterflies the species were given names that reflected the plants on which the larvae were found. Today the science of [[ecology]] focuses on understanding animals' feeding preferences and which plants play a critical role in the [[food chain]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science, 17th Century to Present: Pioneers, Activists and Protagonists|editors=Donna Spalding Andréolle &amp; Veronique Molinari|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443830676|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merian in her detailed studies made several other unique observations. In relation to larvae she recorded that "many shed their skins completely three or four times". She illustrated this with a drawing showing a shed [[exoskeleton]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; She also detailed the ways in which larvae formed their [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]]s, the possible effects of climate on their metamorphosis and numbers, their mode of locomotion, and the fact that when caterpillars "have no food, they devour each other". Such information was recorded by Merian for specific species.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;

=== Research in Surinam ===

In 1699 Merian travelled to [[Dutch Surinam]] to study and record the tropical insects.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The pursuit of her work in [[Suriname]] was an unusual endeavour, especially for a woman. In general, only men received royal or government funding to travel in the [[colonies]] to find new species of plants and animals, make collections and work there, or settle. Scientific expeditions at this period of time were not common, and Merian's self-funded expedition raised many eyebrows. She succeeded, however, in [[discovery (observation)|discovering]] a whole range of previously unknown animals and plants in the interior of Surinam. Merian spent time studying and classifying her findings and described them in great detail. She not only described the insects she found, but also noted their habitat, habits and uses to [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous people]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her classification of butterflies and moths is still relevant today. She used [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] names to refer to the plants, which became used in Europe:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I created the first classification for all the insects which had chrysalises, the daytime butterflies and the nighttime moths. The second classification is that of the maggots, worms, flies, and bees. I retained the indigenous names of the plants, because they were still in use in America by both the locals and the Indians.&lt;ref name=foreword /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Merian's drawings of plants, frogs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Etheridge|first=Kay|journal=[[Bibliotheca Herpetologica]]|year=2010|volume=8|pages=20–27|title=Maria Sybilla Merian's Frogs |url=http://public.gettysburg.edu/~ketherid/merianfrogs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; snakes, spiders, iguanas, and tropical beetles are still collected today by amateurs all over the world. The German word ''Vogelspinne''—(a spider of the infraorder [[Mygalomorphae]]), translated literally as ''bird spider''—probably has its origins in an engraving by Merian. The engraving, created from sketches drawn in Surinam, shows a large spider who had just captured a bird. In the same engraving and accompanying text Merian was the first European to describe both army ants and leaf cutter ants as well as their effect on other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Etheridge |first=Kay |title=Maria Sibylla Merian and the metamorphosis of natural history |journal=Endeavour |year=2011 |volume=35 |pages=16–22 |url=http://public.gettysburg.edu/~ketherid/Endeavor.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.endeavour.2010.10.002 |pmid=21126767 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merian's depictions of tropical ants were subsequently cited and copied by other artists. Her depictions of the struggle among organisms predates [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]] theories on the struggle for survival and [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science, 17th Century to Present: Pioneers, Activists and Protagonists|editors=Donna Spalding Andréolle &amp; Veronique Molinari|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443830676|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1705, three years after returning from her expedition, she published ''Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; ''Metamorphosis'' was first published at her own expense.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science, 17th Century to Present: Pioneers, Activists and Protagonists|editors=Donna Spalding Andréolle &amp; Veronique Molinari|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443830676|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merian had returned from Surinam with sketches and notes. As the word spread among scholars in Amsterdam visitors came to view her paintings of exotic insects and plants. She noted "Now that I had returned to Holland and several nature-lovers had seen my drawings, they pressured me eagerly to have them printed. They were of the opinion that this was the first and most unusual work ever painted in America." Merian with the assistance of her daughters Johanna and Dorothea put together a series of plates. She did not make the printing plates herself this time, but hired three printmakers to do the engraving. She supervised the work closely. To pay for this work she advertised for subscribers, who were willing to give her money in advance for a hand-painted deluxe edition of the ''Metamorphosis''. 12 subscribers paid in advance to receive the expensive hand painted edition, while a less expensive printed edition in black and white was also published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maria Sibylla Merian: Artist, Scientist, Adventurer|authors=Sarah B. Pomeroy &amp; Jeyaraney Kathirithamby|publisher=Getty Publications|year=2018|isbn= 9781947440012|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After her death the book was reprinted in 1719, 1726 and 1730, finding a larger audience.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt; It was published in German, Dutch, Latin and French.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science, 17th Century to Present: Pioneers, Activists and Protagonists|editors=Donna Spalding Andréolle &amp; Veronique Molinari|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443830676|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merian contemplated publishing the book in English, so that she could present it to the queen of England. She mused "It is reasonable for a woman to make such a gift to a person of the same sex". But nothing came of the plan.&lt;ref name="Getty Publications"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maria Sibylla Merian: Artist, Scientist, Adventurer|authors=Sarah B.

''Metamorphosis'' and the tropical ants Merian documented were cited by the scientists [[René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur|René Antoine]], [[August Johann Rösel von Rosenhof]], [[Mark Catesby]] and [[George Edwards (naturalist)|George Edwards]]. Few colour images of the ''New World'' were printed before 1700 and thus Merian's ''Metamorphosis'' has been credited with influencing a range of naturalist illustrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science, 17th Century to Present: Pioneers, Activists and Protagonists|editors=Donna Spalding Andréolle &amp; Veronique Molinari|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443830676|pages=44, 45, 46 &amp; 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merian also documented the medicinal use of plants and animals by the people of Surinam. She documented among others that the sap from a palm was used rubbed into itchy scalps to treat worm infections.&lt;ref name="Getty Publications"/&gt; Merian also took an interest in agriculture and among the local fruit she showcased was the [[pineapple]].&lt;ref name="BRILL"/&gt; When describing the pineapple Merian cited several standard works on natural history, which had first documented the fruit, such as ''Historia Naturalis Brasilae'' by [[Willem Piso]] and [[Georg Marggraf]], ''Hortus Malabaricus'' by [[Hendrik van Rheede]], and ''Medici Amstelodamensis'' by [[Caspar Commelin]]. While the pineapple had been drawn before, Merian's went on to become the most prominent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empire of the Senses: Sensory Practices of Colonialism in Early America|authors=Daniela Hacke &amp; Paul Musselwhite|publisher=BRILL|year=2017|isbn= 9789004340640|pages=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; She called the pineapple by its local name ''annanas'', and provided information on how the butterflies and cockroaches affected crops and agriculture in the colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empire of the Senses: Sensory Practices of Colonialism in Early America|authors=Daniela Hacke &amp; Paul Musselwhite|publisher=BRILL|year=2017|isbn= 9789004340640|pages=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; While documenting the botany of Surinam, Merian stayed true to her method of recording the metamorphosis of insects. Surinam's insects were shown throughout their entire lifecycle and on their plant host.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empire of the Senses: Sensory Practices of Colonialism in Early America|authors=Daniela Hacke &amp; Paul Musselwhite|publisher=BRILL|year=2017|isbn= 9789004340640|pages=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her drawings of Surinam animal and plant life is so accurate that [[entomologists]] who analysed her study journal from the expedition could identify 73 percent of the [[lepidopteran]]s by their genus and 66 percent as exact species. Some of the animals and plants she drew are likely to have since become extinct. Her drawings are part of the scientific exploration by Europeans. Early [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of tropical plants relied on images or specimens. Following her return to Amsterdam the images she had made were used by [[Carl Linnaeus]] and others to identify one hundred or so new species.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Science, 17th Century to Present: Pioneers, Activists and Protagonists|editors=Donna Spalding Andréolle &amp; Veronique Molinari|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443830676|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time there was no standardised scientific terminology to name plants and animals, so Merian used common everyday European words to describe Surinam's animals, such as silkworm or [[wasp]]. As such she referred to butterflies as ''summer birds''. However, based on her drawings Linnaeus classified Surinam's animals in 1735 and 1753. He used Merian's drawings to describe 56 animals and 39 plants, including the [[tarantula]]. In reference to her research Linnaeus abbreviated her name into ''Mer.sruin'' for animals from Surinam, and ''Mer.eur'' for European insects.&lt;ref name="ReferenceG"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maria Sibylla Merian: Artist, Scientist, Adventurer|authors=Sarah B. Pomeroy &amp; Jeyaraney Kathirithamby|publisher=Getty Publications|year=2018|isbn= 9781947440012|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merian was the first European women to independently go on a scientific expedition in [[South America]]. In the 19th century [[Ida Pfeiffer]], [[Alexandrine Tinne]], [[Florence Baker]], [[Mary French Sheldon]], [[Mary Henrietta Kingsley]] and [[Marianne North]] followed in her footsteps and explore the natural world of [[Africa]]. [[Margaret Fountaine]] studied butterflies on five continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Great Apes: A Short History|authors=Chris Herzfeld|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2017|isbn= 9780300231656|pages=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merian's scientific expedition of Surinam predated [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s famous South America expedition by 100 years, and that of [[Princess Theresa of Bavaria]] by 200 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Große Frauen: Portraits aus fünf Jahrhunderten|authors=Irma Hildebrandt|publisher=Diederichs Verlag|year=2010|isbn=9783641039721|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merian's publication on her expedition was later identified as a key exponent of illustrated geographical publications originating in Holland in the late 17th century, which marketed an ''exotic'' but accessible new world to Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Insect and the Image: Visualizing Nature in Early Modern Europe, 1500-1700|author=Janice Neri|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2011|isbn=9780816667642|pages=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scientific practice in Amsterdam ===
[[File:Merian Metamorphosis Titel.jpg|thumb|upright|Merian's major work, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium|de}}'']]
When Merian moved to Amsterdam in 1691 she made the acquaintance of several naturalists.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Amsterdam was the centre of the [[Dutch Golden Age]] and a nexus for science, art and trade.&lt;ref name="Kim Todd 2013 9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chrysalis: Maria Sibylla Merian and the Secrets of Metamorphosis|author=Kim Todd|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2013|isbn= 9780547538099|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When settling in, Merian found support from the artist [[Michiel van Musscher]], who lived not far away.&lt;ref name="Natalie Zemon Davis 1995 166"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women on the Margins: Three Seventeenth-century Lives|author=Natalie Zemon Davis|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1995|isbn=9780674955202|pages=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; She took in students, one being [[Rachel Ruysch]], daughter of the anatomist and physician [[Frederick Ruysch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women on the Margins: Three Seventeenth-century Lives|author=Natalie Zemon Davis|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1995|isbn=9780674955202|pages=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merian became an important figure among Amsterdam's botanists, scientists and collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women on the Margins: Three Seventeenth-century Lives|author=Natalie Zemon Davis|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1995|isbn=9780674955202|pages=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her ''Caterpillars'' books were getting noticed among the scientific community in England, she continued to breed caterpillars at home and ventured into the country side surrounding Amsterdam to study ants.&lt;ref name="Natalie Zemon Davis 1995 166"/&gt; Among her friends were the director of the Amsterdam Botanical Garden [[Caspar Commelin]], the mayor of Amsterdam and president of the [[Dutch East India Company]] [[Nicolas Witsen]], the professor of medicine [[Fredericus Ruysch]], and the merchant and collector [[Levinus Vincent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empire of the Senses: Sensory Practices of Colonialism in Early America|authors=Daniela Hacke &amp; Paul Musselwhite|publisher=BRILL|year=2017|isbn= 9789004340640|pages=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trading ships brought back never seen before shells, plants and preserved animals.&lt;ref name="Kim Todd 2013 9"/&gt; But Merian was not interested in preserving, collecting or studying specimens. When she received a specimen from [[James Petiver]] she wrote to him that she was interested in "the formation, propagation, and metamorphosis of creatures, how one emerges from the other, and the nature of their diet." &lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt; Nevertheless, Merian accepted contract work. She helped to illustrate the book ''The Amboinese Curiosity Cabinet'' written by [[Georg Eberhard Rumpf]]. Rumpf was a naturalists and in the course of his work for the [[Dutch East India Company]] had collected Indonesian shells, rocks, fossils and sea animals. Merian, and possibly her daughter Dorothea, helped to compile illustrations of the specimens for the book. It was published in 1705.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maria Sibylla Merian: Artist, Scientist, Adventurer|authors=Sarah B. Pomeroy &amp; Jeyaraney Kathirithamby|publisher=Getty Publications|year=2018|isbn= 9781947440012|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exotic specimens on display in Amsterdam may have inspired her to travel to Surinam, but only interrupted her study of European insects briefly. Merian continued her collection and observation activities, adding plates to her ''Caterpillars'' books and updating the existing plates. She republished the two volumes in Dutch in 1713 and 1714 under the title ''Der Rupsen''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; She extended her studies into [[flies]] and rewrote the preface to her books to eradicate any mention of spontaneous generation. She explained that flies emerged from a caterpillar pupa, and suggested that flies could be born from excrement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chrysalis: Maria Sibylla Merian and the Secrets of Metamorphosis|author=Kim Todd|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2013|isbn= 9780547538099|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 50 plates and descriptions of European insects that appear to have been intended for a third volume were published after her death by her daughters, who combined them with the 1713 editions to one large volume. A number of ''Metamorphosis'' editions were also published posthumously by her family, to which 12 additional plates were added. All but two appear to have been Merian's work.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Merian was described as lively, hardworking and courteous by a visiting scholar in 1711. Her house was full of drawings, insects, plants, fruit and on the walls were her Surinam watercolours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maria Sibylla Merian: Artist, Scientist, Adventurer|authors=Sarah B. Pomeroy &amp; Jeyaraney Kathirithamby|publisher=Getty Publications|year=2018|isbn= 9781947440012|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before Merian's death, her work was seen in Amsterdam by [[Peter the Great]]. After her death, he acquired a significant number of her paintings&lt;ref&gt;Todd (2007), pp. 228–229&lt;/ref&gt; which to this day are kept in academic collections in St. Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Maria Sibylla Merian, 1647–1717: artist and naturalist |year=1998 |publisher=[[Gerd Hatje|Verlag Gerd Hatje]] |location=Ostfildern-Ruit |isbn=3775707514 |pages=34 and 54 |editor=Wettengl, Kurt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eponyms==
[[File:Danedlion_Maria_Sibylla_Merian.png|thumb|right|Plate 8 of ''Caterpillars'', first volume. Depicting a [[Taraxacum]], with the ''[[Calliteara pudibunda]]'' moth. The Dutch common name for the moth ''Meriansborstel'' is named for Merian.]]
The universal classification system for all organisms was started by [[Carl Linnaeus]] about 30 years after Merian had published her research on Suriname. It is organised in five levels of kingdom, class, order, genus and species.&lt;ref name="ReferenceG"/&gt; After her death Merian became so renown among biologists that number of [[Taxon|taxa]], and two [[Genus|genera]], were named after her. Two butterflies have been named after her, the common [[postman butterfly]] ''Heliconius melpomene meriana'' and a [[split-banded owlet]] butterfly ''Opsiphanes cassina merianae''. The Cuban sphinx moth has been named ''[[Erinnyis merianae]]''. A [[Tessaratomidae|bug]] with no common name has been named ''Plisthenes merianae''. A genus of [[mantises]] has been named ''[[Sibylla (mantis)|Sibylla]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceH"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maria Sibylla Merian: Artist, Scientist, Adventurer|authors=Sarah B. Pomeroy &amp; Jeyaraney Kathirithamby|publisher=Getty Publications|year=2018|isbn= 9781947440012|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bird-eating spider ''[[Avicularia merianae]]'' was named in her honour, referencing her research on spiders. The spider ''[[Metellina merianae]]'' was named after her in 2017. The Argentine black-and-white tegu lizard has been named ''[[Salvator merianae]]''. The [[cane toad]] was named ''Rhinella merianae''. A snail with no common name was named ''Coquandiella meriana''. The Madagascan [[African stonechat]] bird was given the name ''Saxicola torquatus sibilla''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceH"/&gt;

A genus of exotic flowering plants was named ''Meriana''. A bulbil bugle-lily was given the name ''[[Watsonia meriana]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceH"/&gt;

== Modern appreciation ==
In the last quarter of the 20th century, the work of Merian was re-evaluated, validated, and reprinted.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last= Erlanger-Glozer |first=Liselotte |date=March–April 1978|title= Maria Sibylla Merian, 17th Century Entomologist, Artist, and Traveller |journal= Insect World Digest|volume= 3 |issue= 2 |pages= 12–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her portrait was printed on the [[Deutsche Mark|500 DM note]] before Germany converted to the [[euro]]. Her portrait has also appeared on a 0.40 DM stamp, released on 17 September 1987, and many schools are named after her. In the late 1980s [[Archiv]] imprint of the [[Polydor]] label issued a series of new recordings of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s piano works performed on period instruments and featuring Merian's floral illustrations.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} She was honoured with a [[Google Doodle]] on 2 April 2013 to mark her 366th birth anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/google-doodle/9965980/Maria-Sibylla-Merian-Scientific-illustrator-honoured-with-Google-doodle.html|accessdate=2 April 2013|title=Maria Sibylla Merian: Scientific illustrator honoured with Google doodle | location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=James|last=Lachno}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The renewed scientific and artistic interest in her work was triggered in part by a number of scholars who examined collection of her works, such as the one in [[Rosenborg Castle]], [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Early Professional Women in Northern Europe, C. 1650–1850|authors=Johanna Ilmakunnas, Marjatta Rahikainen &amp; Kirsi Vainio-Korhonen|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2017|isbn=9781317146742|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, a modern [[research vessel]] named [[RV Maria S.

=== Daughters ===
Today, while Merian has experienced reinvigorated fame in the eyes of the art and science communities, some of her work has finally been accurately reattributed to her daughters, Dorothea and Johanna. [[Johanna Helena Herolt|Joanna Helena Herolt]] often did not receive credit for her artwork because they were created in collaboration with her mother. Today her works are in the process of recovery. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Similarly, [[Dorothea Maria Graff]]'s images have only recently been accredited to the German painter: Sam Segal has reattributed 30 or 91 folios in the [[British Museum]].

The '''National Book Critics Circle''' ('''NBCC''') is an [[United States|American]] [[nonprofit organization]] ([[501(c) organization|501(c)(3)]]) with nearly 600 members. It is the [[professional association]] of American [[book review]] editors and critics, known primarily for the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]]s, a set of [[literary awards]] presented every March.

The organization was founded April 1974 in [[New York City]] by "[[John Leonard (critic)|John Leonard]], Nona Balakian, and Ivan Sandrof intending to extend the Algonquin round table to a national conversation".&lt;ref name=about&gt;
National Book Critics Circle ('''NBCC'''): About: [http://bookcritics.org/about/ "Thirty-five Years of Quality Writing and Criticism"]. Retrieved 2012-02-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was formally chartered October 1974 as a [[New York state]] non-profit corporation and the Advisory Board voted in November to establish annual literary awards.&lt;ref name=newsletter1975&gt;
[http://bookcritics.org/images/uploads/vol1no1march011975.pdf ''The National Book Critics Circle Journal'' 1:1, March 1, 1975], NBCC. Retrieved 2012-02-02.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the first newsletter three months later, President Ivan Sandrof proclaimed the primary purpose "to improve and maintain the standards of [[literary criticism]] in an era of diminishing and deteriorating values". At that time there were 140 members, with outreach to freelance critics planned for that year.&lt;ref name=newsletter1975/&gt;

NBCC first presented its Awards in January 1976 to books published during 1975 in four categories.&lt;ref name=newsletter1976&gt;
[http://bookcritics.org/images/uploads/vol2no1spring1976.pdf ''The National Book Critics Circle Journal'' 2:1, Spring 1976], NBCC. Retrieved 2012-02-02.&lt;/ref&gt;
Only active review editors and reviewers may be voting members; they elect the 24 Directors who formally make nominations and alone make final selections each year.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;&lt;ref name=members&gt;
[http://bookcritics.org/membership/ "Membership"] (no date), NBCC. Retrieved 2012-02-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fifth award category for books (Autobiography/Biography) was added for 1983 and divided in two for 2005. Since 2005 there are eight awards. Six National Book Critics Circle Awards recognize "best books" published in the United States during the preceding year in six categories: fiction, nonfiction, autobiography, biography, criticism, and poetry.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;
[http://www.bookcritics.org/faqs "Frequently Asked Questions"] (no date), NBCC. Retrieved 2012-02-02.&lt;/ref&gt;
Annually "the most accomplished reviewer" among its members is recognized by the [[National Book Critics Circle Award#Nona Balakian Citation for Excellence in Reviewing |Nona Balakian Citation for Excellence in Reviewing]] (from 1991).
The NBCC also recognizes no more than one person or organization for "exceptional contributions to books" with the [[National Book Critics Circle Award#Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award |Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award]] (from 1981 under more than one name).
&lt;!-- source: our article on the awards --&gt;
All eight awards are officially dated in the preceding year.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;

As a professional association, NBCC also works to improve the quality of reviews and provides services to its members.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref name=newsletter1975/&gt;&lt;ref name=members/&gt;

The '''National Prize for Plastic Arts''' ({{lang-es|'''Premio Nacional de Artes Plásticas'''}}) was created in [[Chile]] in 1992 under Law 19169 as one of the replacements of the [[National Prize of Art of Chile|National Prize of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=30536&amp;idVersion=1992-09-26 |title=Ley 19169: Establece normas sobre otorgamiento de Premios Nacionales |trans-title=Law 19169: Establishes Rules on Granting National Prizes |publisher=[[Ministry of Education (Chile)|Ministry of Education]] |language=Spanish |date=26 September 1992 |access-date=8 December 2017 |via=Library of the National Congress of Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is granted "to the person who has distinguished himself by his achievements in the respective area of the arts" (Article 8 of the aforementioned law). It is part of the [[National Prize of Chile]].

The prize, which is awarded every two years, consists of a diploma, the sum of 6,576,457 [[Chilean peso|pesos]] ({{US$|{{To USD|6576457|CHL|round=yes}}}}) which is adjusted every year, according to the previous year's [[consumer price index]], and a pension of 20 {{ill|Monthly tax unit|es|Unidad tributaria mensual|lt=monthly tax units}} (approximately US$1,600).

'''Needle time''' was created in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians' Union]] and [[Phonographic Performance Limited]] to restrict the amount of recorded music that could be transmitted by the [[BBC]] during the course of any 24-hour period.  The number of hours per week allowed gradually increased over the years from below 30 hours in the 1950s. Until 1967{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} the BBC was allowed to play only five hours per day of commercial gramophone records on the air. It continued to affect [[BBC Radio 1]], [[BBC Radio 2]] and the [[Independent Local Radio]] stations until 1988.

The result was that the BBC had to use "cover" versions of popular songs by groups such as [[Shane Fenton and the Fentones]] recorded at the BBC studios, or orchestral versions by one of the in-house orchestras, to fill in the hours.

The term "needle time" comes from the use (at the time) of gramophone records as the main source of recorded music, which were played on gramophone record players using a [[magnetic cartridge|gramophone needle]].

==Needle time notice==
Unlike American records, British records at the time carried a warning message around the edge of the record label in the centre of the record itself to the effect that: "Unauthorised public performance or broadcasting of this record is strictly prohibited."

===Radio Luxembourg===
Although the record industry in [[UK|Britain]] wanted the public to buy its records, it had to give them some airtime so that the public could find out about their existence. To that end the record industry used the commercial nighttime signals from [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] whose powerful AM signal could be heard in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. The "208" shows on Luxembourg were mainly fifteen minutes to thirty minutes in length and presented under names such as the ''[[Decca Records]] Show'' or the ''[[Capitol Records]] Show''. These prerecorded programmes resembled what later became known as [[Infomercials]], because they normally only featured a little over half of the record, with heavy plugging for title, artist and label.

Because all the hours of transmission were booked up by the major record companies (EMI, Decca, Pye, Philips etc.) groups and artists had to sign to them to get any exposure. This was one of the driving forces for [[Ronan O'Rahilly]] and others to start the first pirate radio station to get exposure for artists he represented.

===The "pirate stations"===
Unlike the [[BBC]] or Radio Luxembourg, the offshore [[pirate radio]] stations of the 1960s operated not only outside the three-mile limit of [[territorial waters]], but also in a grey area of the law. Because the studios and transmitters were located on board the ships or offshore structures, the personnel on board were only under the authority of the captain of that ship or structure. In the case of ship stations such as [[Wonderful Radio London]] which introduced [[top 40]] radio to Britain, the ship was actually registered in a foreign country and therefore subject to the laws of that country, which of course did not recognize "needle time". [[Payola]] operated on several of these stations.

'''Paul Rosenberg''' (29 December 1881 – 29 June 1959) was a French [[art dealer]]. He represented [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]] and [[Henri Matisse]]. Both Paul and his brother [[Léonce Rosenberg]] were among the world's major dealers of modern art.

==Career==
The younger son of antiques dealer Alexandre Rosenberg, Paul and his elder brother [[Léonce Rosenberg|Léonce]] joined their father's business. Alexandre had established his business in 1878, and by 1898 had become a noted dealer of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art.&lt;ref name=MOMA/&gt; He educated his sons in this passion by allowing them both a [[grand tour]] via London, Berlin, Vienna and New York to acquire experience and contacts. During the tour, Paul bought two [[van Gogh]] drawings and a [[Manet]] portrait for $220, which he had transported to his father's gallery and sold onwards at a profit.&lt;ref name=DBeast/&gt; From 1906 on, the brothers worked as partners within the business.  When their father retired, they became directors. Having established their own networks, the brothers opened their own separate galleries in the city's [[8th arrondissement of Paris|8th arrondissement]], with Paul at 21 [[rue La Boétie]] (opened in 1911) and Léonce in the rue de la Baume.&lt;ref name=MOMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt;

===Paris: 1911–1940===
Léonce became a noted champion of [[Cubism]], a lead that Paul followed, but being located in a more noted art district, he gained better contacts and greater finances. Working initially with his brother-in-law [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]], Paul and his partner [[Georges Wildenstein]] established and then won over from Kahnweiler exclusive relationships with: [[Picasso]] (from 1918); [[Braque]] (1922); [[Marie Laurencin]]; [[Fernand Léger]] (1927); and latterly [[Matisse]] (1936).&lt;ref name=MOMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt;

Paul's stock included pieces by all of the classical and contemporary French and major European artists, and latterly American artists, including: [[Marsden Hartley]]; [[Max Weber (artist)|Max Weber]]; [[Abraham Rattner]]; [[Karl Knaths]]; [[Harvey Weiss]]; [[Oronzio Maldarelli]]; [[Nicolas de Staël]]; [[Graham Sutherland]]; [[Kenneth Armitage]]; and [[Giacomo Manzù]]. The result was that from 1920, Paul Rosenberg's company was widely acknowledged to be without doubt the most active and influential gallery in the world.&lt;ref name=MOMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt;

With the early artist relationships, like Kahnweiler had, Rosenberg gave the artists financial security by agreeing to buy their works on the basis of an exclusive contract. Rosenberg lent Picasso money after his honeymoon with the ballerina [[Olga Khokhlova]] and found them an apartment in Paris next to his own family home, generosity which resulted in a lifelong friendship between these two very different men. Rosenberg's purchases from Picasso included ''[[Nude, Green Leaves and Bust]]'' (1932), a portrait of Picasso's mistress [[Marie-Thérèse Walter]], which Rosenberg sold in New York in 1951 to [[Frances Lasker Brody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Picasso painting fetches record $106m at auction | work = BBC News | date = 2010-05-05 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts_and_culture/8661338.stm | accessdate = 2010-05-05 | ref = CITEREFbbc2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every summer the Rosenberg family and the Picasso family would depart for the South of France, holidaying there with friends including [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Somerset Maugham]], [[Stravinsky]], [[Ravel]] and Matisse.&lt;ref name=NYDT757095&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/masterpiece-plunder-paul-rosenberg-fled-europe-1940-nazis-snatched-priceless-art-holdings-search-treasure-carried-descendants-article-1.757095#ixzz2jdYxNXbQ | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Masterpiece plunder as Paul Rosenberg fled Europe in 1940, the nazis snatched his priceless art holdings. The search for the treasure is carried on by his descendants.. - NY Da...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenberg's reputation for clean dealing enabled him by 1935 to persuade his  brother-in-law [[Jacques Helft]], a noted antiques dealer, to open a branch in [[Bond Street]], London, to enable them to engage with more Americans.&lt;ref name=MOMA/&gt; Noted clients included museums such as the [[Museum of Modern Art|Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)]] (of which Rosenberg was an early supporter and donor), and the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. His private clients included [[Alfred H. Barr, Jr.]],&lt;ref name=MoMAEx/&gt; [[Chester Dale]], [[Douglas Dillon]], and [[Marjorie Acker Phillips|Marjorie]] and [[Duncan Phillips (art collector)|Duncan Phillips]], who through purchases from Rosenberg created much of the modern collections within [[The Phillips Collection]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref name=DBeast/&gt;

In the late 1930s, Rosenberg, alert to signs of an approaching war, began quietly moving his collection out of continental Europe to the London branch and to storage in America (via the [[1939 New York World's Fair]]), Australia and latterly South America. He then stopped adding to his collection in France, and advised his artists to make similar arrangements. Although his relocation plans were well advanced, by the time of the 1940 [[Nazi invasion of France]], he still held over 2,000 pieces in the country, both in his gallery and in storage.&lt;ref name=MOMA/&gt; The Rosenbergs were Jewish and had to flee Nazi-occupied France.  They owed their lives to the Portuguese Consul-General in Bordeaux, [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], who issued them visas to his country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sousamendesfoundation.org/helft-loevi-rosenberg/|title=Helft/Loevi/Rosenberg|work=sousamendesfoundation.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109032911/http://sousamendesfoundation.org/helft-loevi-rosenberg/|archivedate=2013-11-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1940, Nazi [[Alfred Rosenberg]] established the Parisian base of the [[Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg|Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (ERR)]],&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt; whose purpose was to confiscate [[free masonry|masonic]] artifacts and the highest-quality works of art for Hitler's planned [[Führermuseum]] in [[Linz]], Austria.&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt; All looted art works, including Paul Rosenberg's, were initially shipped by truck to the depot created in the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]].&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt; There Nazi art historians, experts, photographers, and maintenance and administrative personnel appraised, filed, photographed and packed what were now termed "ownerless cultural goods" for rail transport to Germany.&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt;&lt;ref name=BJParis/&gt; French officials at the end of the war estimated that one third of all art in French private hands had been confiscated.&lt;ref name=Feliciano&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy To Steal The World's Greatest Works Of Art|author=[[Hector Feliciano]]|publisher=Basic Books|date=25 April 1998|ISBN=978-0465041916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BJParis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonjourparis.com/story/the-lost-museum/|title=The Lost Museum|author=Hector Feliciano|date= 1998|accessdate= 4 November 2013|work=Bonjour Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York: 1940–1959===
Rosenberg, his wife, his daughter Micheline and her husband Joseph Robert Schwartz,&lt;ref name=DBeast/&gt; all travelled via [[Lisbon]], arriving at the Madison Hotel in New York in September 1940. There, with the help of well established friends and pieces that he had already disbursed around the world, he established a new gallery at No. 79 East 57th Street. The opening was well received by the art world, and garnered a four-page article within ''[[Art Digest]]''.

From this base post-war, Rosenberg managed to reclaim and re-purchase a number of pieces from his pre-war collection, but these represented less than half of the works he had lost.&lt;ref name=MOMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYDT757095/&gt; After the end of hostilities, he personally travelled to Paris to hear the tales of the family chauffeur Louis, who told of the coming of ERR trucks not long after the family had departed.&lt;ref name=NYDT757095/&gt; On this first trip, Rosenberg managed to regain the 1918 Picasso portrait of his wife and daughter—one of three—renamed by Göring ''Mother and Child''—from a small museum in Paris.&lt;ref name=NYDT757095/&gt;

Rosenberg later regained a number of pieces after their confiscation by the US Army. In 1953, an exhibition of 89 pieces from Rosenberg's personal and private post-war collection were displayed at MoMA.&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890762,00.html |date=December 7, 1953 |title=Art: Dealer's Choice |work=Time Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; These included ''[[Nude Reclining by the Sea]]'' (1868) by [[Gustave Courbet]], which was taken on 5 September 1941 by the ERR in a raid on Rosenberg's bank vault in [[Bordeaux]] together with another 162 of his paintings. The Courbet was catalogued at the Jeu de Paume in December 1941. It was later recovered from Göring's personal collection and repatriated to Rosenberg in New York. Rosenberg sold it in April 1953 to the New York collector [[Louis E. Stern]], who donated it in 1964 to the Philadelphia Museum of Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/98-487-371.html?page=2|title=Philadelphia Museum of Art - Collections  :  Provenance|author=Philadelphia Museum of Art|work=philamuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexandre joined his father in New York in 1946 and became a partner in 1952. After the death of his father in 1959 in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10D15FE3458137B93C3A9178CD85F4D8585F9 |title=Paul Rosenberg, Art Dealer, Dies |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 1, 1959 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandre became the company's principal. In 1962 Alexandre was a co-founder and first President of the [[Art Dealers Association of America]], remaining one of the association's permanent board members throughout his life. He also served as an adviser to both the American Government and the [[Internal Revenue Service]] on matters pertaining to art works. After Alexandre's premature death in 1987 in London from an [[aneurysm]], whilst attending the reunion of the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|US Army Second Armored Division]],&lt;ref name=NYDT757095/&gt; his wife Elaine took over the business. Following the death of Micheline in 2007, the family agreed to donate their grandfather's archives to MoMA, which held a supporting exhibition of the collection in 2010.&lt;ref name=MOMA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/learn/resources/archives/EAD/PaulRosenbergf|title=The Paul Rosenberg Archives  A Gift of Elaine and Alexandre Rosenberg|work=moma.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt;&lt;ref name=MoMAEx&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2010/paulrosenberg/|title=MoMA.org - Paul Rosenberg and Company: From France to America|work=moma.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art collection recovery==
[[File:Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume.jpg|thumb|250px|Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]]

Because the Nazis banned so-called "[[degenerate art]]" from entering Germany, art so designated in France was looted and held in what became known as the "Martyr's Room" at the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Feliciano |first=Hector |url=http://www.bonjourparis.com/story/the-lost-museum/ |title=The Lost Museum |publisher=Bonjour Paris |date = 1998 |accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of Rosenberg's professional and personal collection was branded as "degenerate art" and thereby fell under the mandate of the Commission for the Exploitation of Degenerate Art. Following [[Joseph Goebels]] personal directive to sell these degenerate works for foreign currency to fund the building of the [[Führermuseum]] and the wider war effort, [[Hermann Göring]] appointed a series of [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce|ERR]]-approved dealers to liquidate these assets. Göring instructed them to give him the proceeds, with which he intended to grow his personal art collection.&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt; With much of this looted art sold onwards via Switzerland, Rosenberg's collection was scattered across Europe.

Today, some 70 of his paintings are missing, including: the large [[Pablo Picasso]] watercolor, ''Naked Woman on the Beach'', painted in Provence in 1923; seven works by [[Matisse]]; and the ''Portrait of Gabrielle Diot'' by [[Degas]].&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt;&lt;ref name=BJParis/&gt;

[[File:The Train (1964 film) trailer 1.jpg|thumb|left|L. to R.: [[Paul Scofield]], [[Michel Simon]] (background) and [[Burt Lancaster]] in ''The Train'' - trailer]]
In June 1940, via the [[Dunkirk evacuation]], his son Alexandre Rosenberg had escaped to England. There he was commissioned as a Lieutenant into the [[Free French Forces]]. After being part of the [[D-Day Invasion]], in August 1944 north of Paris a troop under the command of Lt. Rosenberg dynamited tracks north of Nazi train No. 40,044 and seized it, as it was attempting to transfer looted treasures to Germany.&lt;ref name=NYDT757095/&gt; Upon his soldiers opening the train's boxcar doors, Alexandre viewed many plundered pieces of art that had once been displayed in the home of his father. The seizure saved about 400 pieces of his father's art from being lost, including many masterpieces. Alexandre was demobilized in 1946, and left immediately for his family in New York to join his father's business. The train's interception was the inspiration for the 1964 film ''[[The Train (1964 film)|The Train]]'', starring  [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Paul Scofield]], [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Michel Simon]].&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Patricia and Mashberg, Tom.

A1; published online April 26, 2013. Retrieved April 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1950s, Rosenberg lost a French lawsuit that he started to recover a Matisse in the south of France, after the judge decreed the masterpiece belonged to the defendant, Rosenberg's own family kin.&lt;ref name=NYDT757095/&gt; After the death of Paul, the family agreed under Alexandre to continue to try to recover the family art works. Consequently, in 1971 they bought back the Degas ''[[Deux Danseuses]]'' for far below its worth.&lt;ref name=NYDT757095/&gt;

In December 1987, whilst reading at the [[Frick Museum]] in New York, Elaine Rosenberg found the painting ''[[Portrait of Gabrielle Diot]]'' by Degas listed for sale in an art magazine at the Mathias F. Hans Gallery in [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt; The listing included the fact that it had come to the current owner via the dealership of Paul Rosenberg.&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt; After she called the dealer and explained her connection to the looted picture, the dealer explained that under his confidentiality rules he could not disclose the current owner's name, but promised to let her know this very important piece of information. On calling a few days later, Elaine Rosenberg was told by the dealer that the "owner" had taken the piece from the gallery and disappeared without leaving any forwarding details.&lt;ref name=Feliciano/&gt;&lt;ref name=BJParis/&gt;

His granddaughter is TV journalist [[Anne Sinclair]], host of political shows and the former wife of [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/21/world/europe/21sinclair.html?_r=1&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all Backing Her Man With Impressive Resources], The New York Times, May 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/28/dominique-strauss-kahn-anne-sinclair-separated_n_1636183.html | work=Huffington Post | title=DSK, Anne Sinclair Have Reportedly Separated | date=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1997, Rosenberg's heirs filed suit in [[United States District Court for the Western District of Washington]], Seattle, to recover the painting ''[[Odalisque]]'' (1927 or 1928) by Matisse from the [[Seattle Art Museum]], the first lawsuit against an American museum concerning ownership of art looted by Nazis during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Felicia R.

===Recent developments===
In 2012, German tax authorities found pieces from Rosenberg's collection in an [[2012 Nazi loot discovery|apartment rented by Cornelius Gurlitt]], son of 1930s German art dealer [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], in [[Schwabing]], [[Munich]]. Over 1,500 pieces were recovered with an estimated value of up to €1bn, including ''Portrait of a Woman'' by Matisse that Rosenberg had left behind after fleeing Paris.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-27810363|title=Gurlitt's Matisse is confirmed to be looted 'Nazi art'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=12 June 2014|accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gurlitt's collection was sent to a secure warehouse in Garching.

In 2012, the Rosenberg family identified ''Profil bleu devant la cheminée'' (Woman in Blue in Front of Fireplace; 1937), a Matisse painting that was confiscated by the Nazis in 1941,&lt;ref&gt;Tom Mashberg (April 5, 2013), [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/06/arts/design/rosenberg-family-asks-norwegian-museum-to-return-a-matisse.html Family Seeks Return of a Matisse Seized by the Nazis], The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; in an exhibition catalogue and demanded that the [[Henie-Onstad Art Centre|Henie-Onstad Art Centre (HOK)]] near [[Oslo]], Norway, return it. Rosenberg had bought the painting directly from Matisse in 1937 and had it stored at the time of the Nazi invasion in a bank vault in [[Libourne]], a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Gironde]] in [[Aquitaine]], southwestern France. The ERR entered the vault in March 1941, and, after cataloging at the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]] in September 1941, it was earmarked for Göring's private collection. Then in the hands of various dealers during the Nazi period, post-war in the late 1940s it was bought by Norwegian shipping magnate [[Niels Onstad]] from the Paris-based dealer [[Henri Bénézit]]. It has since appeared in numerous publications and toured the world on several occasions. Although under Norwegian law, due to the period of ownership, the painting now belongs to HOK, Norway was one of 44 signatories to the [[1998 Washington Conference Principles]] on Nazi-Confiscated Art. Protracted mediation, overseen by Christopher A. Marinello of the [[Art Recovery Group]], saw the painting returned to the heirs of Paul Rosenberg in March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-26680049|title=Nazi looted Matisse work returned by Norwegian gallery|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, Marinello also recovered, for the Rosenberg heirs, ''Portrait of a Seated Woman'' by Henri Matisse, which had been found in the Munich home of [[2012 Munich artworks discovery|Cornelius Gurlitt]].&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Eddy, May 15, 2015.

'''Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät''' ('''PKN''', {{Langnf||Finnish|"Pertti Kurikka's [[name day]]s"}}) were a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[punk rock]] band, formed in 2009 in a charity workshop for adults with [[developmental disabilities]]. They are the main focus of the Finnish documentary film ''[[The Punk Syndrome]]''. In 2015, they qualified for the finals of [[Uuden Musiikin Kilpailu 2015|Uuden Musiikin Kilpailu]], which they later won; they represented Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 but got knocked out in the semi-final. The band disbanded in December 2016 when guitarist Pertti Kurikka turned 60 years old and retired from playing punk rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/art-2000005022200.html|title=Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivien viimeisellä keikalla Tapaninpäivänä oli hikistä, ahdasta ja tunteikasta eli aivan mahtavaa|date=27 December 2016|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2017|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Formation (2004-2012)===
Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät began in a workshop run by Lyhty, a charity for adults with developmental disabilities. In 2004, Pertti Kurikka, the future guitarist of the band, met organizer Kalle Pajamaa of Lyhty.&lt;ref name="Tolonen2013"&gt;{{cite web| title = Never mind the mall punks, here’s Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät!| author = Arttu Tolonen| work =Finnish Music Quarterly |date=June 2013| accessdate = 6 March 2015| url = http://www.fmq.fi/2013/06/never-mind-the-mall-punks-heres-pertti-kurikan-nimipaivat/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pajamaa, who remains manager of the band today, noticed Kurikka's potential and sought to establish a band based upon him.&lt;ref name="Nyt2015a"&gt;{{cite web| title = Nytpedia: Tällainen yhtye on Pertti Kurikan nimipäivät|trans-title=Nytpedia: This is what the band Pertti Kurikan nimipäivät is like| work =Nyt| date = 2 March 2015| accessdate = 6 March 2015| url = http://nyt.fi/a1305932608636| language = Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worked on the band's formation over the next five years,&lt;ref name="Tolonen2013"/&gt; and in 2009 the band made its debut.&lt;ref name="Nyt2015a"/&gt;

In 2009, Finnish director [[Pekka Karjalainen]] sought music performed by people with disabilities for the film ''[[Vähän kunnioitusta]]'',&lt;ref name="Nyt2015b"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Story of PKN, the Finnish punk sensation ready to rock Eurovision| work = Nyt| date = 3 March 2015| accessdate = 6 March 2015| url = http://nyt.fi/a1305933792584}}&lt;/ref&gt; which tells the story of a young girl with a [[learning disability]] aspiring to live an independent and normal life.&lt;ref name="Tolonen2013"/&gt; Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät is featured in the film with their first-ever [[Demo (music)|demo]]: "Kallioon!".&lt;ref name="Tolonen2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mäenpää2015"&gt;{{cite web| title = Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät osallistuu Uuden Musiikin Kilpailuun| author = Arto Mäenpää| work =KaaosZine| date = 13 January 2015| accessdate = 6 March 2015| url = http://kaaoszine.fi/pertti-kurikan-nimipaivat-osallistuu-uuden-musiikin-kilpailuun/|trans-title=Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät takes part in Uuden Musiikin Kilpailu|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song became a hit, and the band soon discovered that they had a following outside the circle of disabled people.&lt;ref name="Nyt2015b"/&gt;

In 2012, their fame grew as they were the main subject of ''[[The Punk Syndrome]]'', a Finnish documentary film. The documentary, depicting the band's story from its outset to their first European tour, earned them a following in Scandinavia and Germany.&lt;ref name="Hay2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hay|first1=Mark|title=A Finnish Punk Band with Learning Disabilities Is Going to Eurovision|url=https://www.vice.com/read/a-finnish-punk-band-with-learning-disabilities-is-going-to-eurovision-189|website=VICE|accessdate=4 March 2015|date=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014: Charity concert with Mr. Lordi===
In 2014, the band performed in a charity concert with [[Mr. Lordi]] of the Finnish rock band, [[Lordi]]. The charity concert was held in Rovaniemi on 23 May 2014 for benefit of the mentally-disabled community of [[Mozambique]] and the Lapland Metkat Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvtl.fi/fi/ajankohtaista/lisaa-ajankohtaisia/?nid=1173 |title=Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät point Mr. Lordi May Rovaniemi|publisher=Kvtl.fi |date=2014-02-28 |accessdate=2015-02-18 |language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät's bold and unusual take on Eurovision has been compared to that of Lordi, [[Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006|Finland's 2006 Eurovision entry]] and the winner of [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|that year's contest]].&lt;ref name="Sputnik2015"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Punk Syndrome: Band With Down Syndrome Applies for Eurovision| work = [[Sputnik (news agency)|Sputnik]]| date = 21 January 2015| accessdate = 6 March 2015| url = http://sputniknews.com/society/20150119/1017088930.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015: Eurovision Song Contest 2015===

The '''Professional Arts Consortium''' (also known as '''ProArts''') is an association of six [[Boston, Massachusetts]] institutions of [[higher education]] which emphasize the [[visual arts|visual]], [[applied art|applied]], and [[performing arts]]. The consortium allows for shared resources, such as libraries, between member schools. Students of member schools may also cross-register for courses in any other member school. It also maintains the [[Boston Arts Academy]] (BAA), a partnership with the [[Boston Public Schools]]. It is made up of [[Berklee College of Music]], [[Boston Architectural College]], [[Boston Conservatory]], [[Emerson College]], [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]], and the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts]].

'''Quinto Cenni''' (20 March 1845 – 13 August 1917) was an [[Italian People|Italian]] [[painter]], [[engraver]], [[lithographer]] and [[illustrator]] who specialized in depicting military personnel and their uniforms.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Imola]] in the [[Papal States]] to a family with liberal sympathies, some of whose members later fought with [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]].&lt;ref name="T"&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/quinto-cenni_(Dizionario_Biografico)/ Brief biography and appreciation] @ [[Treccani]] (includes a biography of his son, Italo).&lt;/ref&gt; His father died in 1856 and his children became scattered. Quinto was sent to [[Bologna]], where a government grant from the city of Imola enabled him to enroll at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Bologna|Accademia di Belle Arti]],&lt;ref name="D"&gt;[http://digilander.libero.it/trombealvento/cartoline/cenni.htm Brief biography] @ Libero.&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied with [[Napoleone Angiolini]]. He soon became interested in new technologies and, from 1862 to 1867, studied [[xylography]] with [[Francesco Ratti]]. In 1867, three years after the death of his mother, he moved to [[Milan]] where he continued his studies at the [[Brera Academy|Accademia di Brera]].&lt;ref name="T" /&gt;
[[File:1er régiment d'infanterie légère napolitain, 1812.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''First Infantry Regiment from Naples in 1812'']]
At that time, photography was still a cumbersome process, so Cenni had an opportunity to develop his skills as an engraver and lithographer by providing images for the numerous illustrated magazines that were coming into existence after the [[Risorgimento]]. After 1870, he worked for numerous periodicals, notably ''Emporio pittoresco'' (published by [[Edoardo Sonzogno|Casa Sonzogno]]) and ''{{ill|L'Illustrazione Italiana|it}}'' (published by {{ill|Fratelli Treves|it}}).&lt;ref name="T" /&gt; From 1887 to 1897, he was Editor of ''L'Illustrazione Militare Italiana''.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt;

By then, he had already chosen to specialize in military subjects, spending many hours on research to assure that the details of the uniforms and equipment were perfectly accurate. Sometimes, he consulted with foreign experts on weaponry specifications. He strove to make daily life in the barracks as interesting as the more dramatic maneuvers, carried out during summer in the picturesque Italian countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Quinto Cenni, plates 307-419 "Esercito Italiano Dell' Ottocento", Rivista Militare 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Peacetime soldiering was portrayed in his works as a generally attractive and challenging fulfillment of one's patriotic duty toward the newly [[Italian unification|unified Italian state]].

Even after the beginning of World War I, he attempted to stay fully informed, but this became increasingly difficult as the situation deteriorated, and he died in [[Carate Brianza]] before the war was over.
[[File:Quinto Cenni - Uniformi della Marina.jpg|thumb|275px|''Uniforms of the Italian Royal Navy'', 1873]]
From 1878 to 1916, he published over a dozen albums featuring various aspects of the Italian military, including volumes on the [[Bersaglieri]] (1886), [[Grenadier|Granatieri]] (1887), and [[Carabinieri]] (1894). He also provided illustrations for ''[[I Promessi Sposi]]'' by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]; ''Ettore Fieramosca'' and ''Niccolò de' Lapi'', both by [[Massimo D'Azeglio]]; and ''L'assedio di Firenze'' by [[Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi]].&lt;ref name="T" /&gt;

Hundreds of his watercolors are currently held in the National Museum at the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]] and the [[Museum of the Risorgimento (Milan)|Museum of the Risorgimento]] in [[Milan]].&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; In 2000, fifty previously unpublished works were presented at an exhibition in [[New York City|New York]].

[[File:Michelangelos Rebellious Slave 3 enhanced.jpg|thumb|Detail]]
The '''''Rebellious Slave''''' is a 2.15m high marble statue by [[Michelangelo]], dated to 1513. It is now held in the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]].

== History ==
The two "slaves" of the Louvre date to the second version of the [[tomb of Pope Julius II]] which was commissioned by the Pope's heirs, the [[Della Rovere]] in May 1513. Although the initial plans for a gigantic mausoleum were set aside, the work was still monumental, with a corridor richly decorated with sculpture and Michelangelo was immediately put in charge of the work. Among the first pieces completed were the two "''Prigioni''" (renamed the "slaves" only in the nineteenth century), destined for the lower part of the funerary monument, next to the pilasters which framed the niches containing the Victories. Their poses were determined by the needs of this architectural setting, so from the front they have great effect, but the side views received less care than usual.

The date of the two statues is confirmed by a letter of Michelangelo to Marcello dei Covi, in which he speaks of a viewing by [[Luca Signorelli]] in his Roman house, while he worked on "a figure of marble, standing four cubits high, which has its hands behind its back".

All the "''Prigioni''" produced in the studio of the artist were eliminated from the monument in its final version, completed in 1542. In 1546 Michelangelo gave the two works in the Louvre to [[Roberto Strozzi]], for his generous hospitality in his Roman house during Michelangelo's periods of sickness in July 1544 and June 1546. When Strozzi was exiled to [[Lyon]] in April 1550 for his opposition to [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici]], he had the two statues sent ahead. In April 1578 they were put on view in two niches in the courtyard of the castle of the [[constable]] of [[Montmorency, Val-d'Oise|Montmorency]] at [[Écouen]], near [[Paris]].

In 1632 they were sold by Henri II de Montmorency to [[Cardinal Richelieu]], who had them sent to his [[Château de Richelieu|Château]] in [[Poitou]], where they were seen by [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]] who made an illustration of them, on his travels.

In 1749, the Duke of Richelieu had them taken to Paris and placed in the [[Pavillon de Hanovre]]. They were hidden in 1793, but when the widow of the last Marshal of Richelieu attempted to put them on sale, they became property of the government and joined the collection which is now in the Louvre.

== Description and style ==
The "Rebellious Slave" is portrayed trying to free himself from the fetters which hold his hands behind his back, contorting his torso and twisting his head. The impression given, which would have contributed to the spatial appearance of the monument, was that he was moving towards the viewer, with his raised shoulder and knee.  

The iconographic significance of the two figures is probably linked to the motif of the Captive in Roman art; in fact [[Giorgio Vasari]] identified them as personifications of the provinces controlled by Julius II. For [[Ascanio Condivi]], however, they symbolised the Arts taken prisoner after the death of pontif. The ''Rebellious Slave'' in particular might, speculatively, represent sculpture or architecture. Other meanings of a symbolic and philosophical nature have been suggested as well as some linked to Michelangelo's personal life and his "torments".

From a stylistic point of view, they are based on [[Greek sculpture|ancient models]], particularly [[Hellenistic sculpture]], like the statue group of ''[[Laocoön and His Sons]]'', discovered in 1506 and at that time in Michelangelo's possession, but also the sculptural friezes on the [[triumphal arch]]es of Rome and depictions of [[Saint Sebastian]].

The '''Rolf Schock Prizes''' were established and endowed by bequest of philosopher and artist [[Rolf Schock]] (1933–1986). The prizes were first awarded in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, in 1993, and since 2005 are awarded every three years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rolfschockprizes.se/engelskasidor/home/theprize.9_en.html&lt;/ref&gt; Each recipient currently receives [[Swedish krona|SEK]] 400,000 (''ca.'' [[United States dollar|US$]] 60,000). A similar prize is the [[Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy]], established by the [[Inamori Foundation]].

The Prizes are awarded in four categories and decided by committees of three of the [[Swedish Royal Academies]]:

*[[Logic]] and [[Philosophy]] (decided by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]])
*[[Mathematics]] (decided by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]])
*[[Visual art|Visual Arts]] (decided by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Arts]])

'''''San Francisco Review of Books''''' ('''''SFRB''''') was a book review periodical published from the mid-1970s to 1997 in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]]. Founding editor-publisher [[Ronald Nowicki]] launched his publication April 1975, a time when the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' depended on the wire services for its reviews. ''SFRB'' began as a magazine and later adopted a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid format]].

In addition to the reviews and coverage of San Francisco's small press scene, ''SFRB'' offered interviews with such authors as [[Eric Ambler]], [[Ann Beattie]], [[Ray Bradbury]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], [[Herbert Gold]], [[Elia Kazan]], [[Jerzy Kosinski]], [[William Kotzwinkle]], [[Henry Miller]], and [[Paul Theroux]].

==Contributors==
The roster of ''SFRB'' contributors included [[Alice Adams (writer)|Alice Adams]], Carolyn Burke, [[Alexander Chee]], [[Peter Dreyer]] (interview with Henry Miller in the February 1977 issue), [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]], Thomas Gladysz, Stephen Greenblatt, Pam Houston, [[Diane Johnson]], Emily Leider, Michael McDonagh, [[Leonard Michaels]], [[Steven Moore (US author)|Steven Moore]], [[Ishmael Reed]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.udel.edu/ud/spec/findaids/reed/intervw.htm |title=University of Delaware: Ishmael Reed Papers |publisher=Lib.udel.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mary Elizabeth Williams. In addition to his editor's column, [[Ronald Nowicki|Nowicki]] also wrote occasional reviews. [[Susie Bright]] was a columnist from 1992 to 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://susiebright.blogs.com/Old_Static_Site_Files/Resume.pdf |title=Susie Bright resume |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When 27-year-old [[Wendy Lesser]], with no editing experience, was a guest editor in 1980, she found the experience so rewarding that three months later she launched her own publication, ''[[The Threepenny Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/01/07/DDGL4ALIBK17.DTL |title=Guthmann, Edward.

''SFRB'' received little funding and had no backers, so it relied on a combination of advertising revenues, subscriptions, grants from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], and volunteers for financial support. Despite the limited funding, ''SFRB'' was published regularly under Nowicki's editorship until the late 1980s. When it was sold in 1989, Nowicki was retained as editor for one year until a successor was installed. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Warsaw.gif|right|thumb|{{deletable image-caption|Wednesday, 5 July 2017|PROD}}]] --&gt;
The publication continued well into the late 1990s with various owners, while [[Ronald Nowicki|Nowicki]] left to interview the last survivors of the [[Warsaw]] cabaret for his first book, ''Warsaw: The Cabaret Years'' (Mercury House, 1992), about cabaret and coffeehouse life between the wars in Warsaw. His articles have appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''[[North American Review]]'' and other publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEED81039F93AA15752C0A96F948260 |title=Nowicki, Ron.

'''Slab-O-Concrete Productions''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[mail order]] [[Direct market|distributor]] and [[publisher]], founded by Peter Pavement, Dave Hanna, Emma Copsey, and Chris Tappenden; operating mostly in [[Brighton and Hove]] during the 1990s. Initially selling [[United Kingdom|British]] [[small press]] [[comics]] and [[zine]]s (including Pavement's own comics), Slab-O-Concrete also imported publications from the [[United States]], [[Australia]], and [[Europe]].

Slab-o-Concrete was originally based in [[Sheffield]]; it moved to [[Brighton and Hove|Hove]] in 1995. After intensely ramping up its publishing line in the late nineties (including moving into CDs and prose books), Slab-O-Concrete was laid low in 2001 as policy changes in the book industry caused cash-flow issues.

== History ==
In general, Slab-O-Concrete avoided distributing traditional [[comic book]]s, instead making connections with [[Underground comix|underground]] publishers, [[zine]]sters, [[independent record label]]s, and other [[Subculture|subcultural]] scenes.

By 1994 Slab-O-Concrete had developed into a publisher, repackaging small press comics and zines for the bookshop market and originating new works. Notable creators published by Slab-O-Concrete included [[Jessica Abel]], [[Ian Carney]], [[Craig Conlan]], [[Alan Moore]], [[Woodrow Phoenix]], and [[Aleksandar Zograf]].

In 1998, Slab-O-Concrete published four titles in partnership with [[Amnesty International]]. The comics were designed as 16-page [[minicomics]] with card stock covers, designed to be sealed and used as postcards. [[ILYA|Ilya]]'s ''A Bowl of Rice'' was about the forcible relocation and killing of [[Shan people|Shan]] rice farmers in [[Burma]]. Enrique Rodríguez's ''Freedom from Discrimination'' was a story about maltreatment of and violence against street children in [[Brazil]], and undocumented, unaccompanied immigrant children in the [[United States]]. Dan Jones' ''Just Deserts'' told the story of a female [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[migrant worker]]'s false conviction and punishment in [[Saudi Arabia]]. Peter Arkle's ''Love'' told the story of Mariana Cetiner, a [[Romanians|Romanian]] woman arrested and imprisoned for allegedly attempting to seduce another woman. In 1999, Slab-O-Concrete published another 16-page mailable minicomic called ''Donna's Day'', by Donna Mathes and [[Peter Bagge]].

One of their final publications, in 1999, was ''The Worm: the Longest Comic Strip in the World'', by [[Alan Moore]] and a "galaxy of greats," which was published in association with the Cartoon Art Trust and the Swedish Council for Cultural Affairs. "In one single working day, over 125 British cartoonists gathered together in one place to create 'the longest comic [wordless] strip in the world.'"&lt;ref&gt;''The Worm'' (Slab-O-Concrete Productions, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Worm'' featured introductions and explanatory text in English, Swedish, and French.

In the [[Outline of entertainment|entertainment industry]], a '''sleeper hit''' is a title (such as a book, film, song or game) that becomes successful, gradually, often with little promotion.{{sfn|Berra|2008|p=68}}

== In film ==
Some sleeper hits in the [[film industry]] are strategically marketed for audiences subtly, such as with [[sneak preview]]s a couple of weeks prior to release, without making them feel obliged to see a heavily promoted film. This alternative form of [[marketing strategy]] has been used in successful films such as ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'' (1993), ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' (1994), ''[[My Best Friend's Wedding]]'' (1997), ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'' (1998), and ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'' (1999).

[[Film screening|Screenings]] for these films are held in an area conducive to the film's demographic. In the case of ''Sleepless in Seattle'', a [[romantic comedy]], screenings were held at suburban shopping malls where romantic couples in their mid 20s to early 30s spent Saturday afternoons before seeing a new film. In theory, a successful screening leads to [[word-of-mouth marketing]], as it compels viewers to discuss an interesting, low-key film with co-workers when they return to work after their weekend.{{sfn|Berra|2008|p=68}}

''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969), which was created on a budget of less than $400,000, became a sleeper hit by earning $50&amp;nbsp;million and garnering attention from younger audiences with its combination of drugs, violence, motorcycles, counter-culture stance, and rock music.{{sfn|Ganeri|Bergan|2006|p=458}}

''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' was considered a flop for the first 6 months of its release until it found popularity in midnight screenings.

The 1979 Australian film ''[[Mad Max]]'', which sprung from the [[Ozploitation]] movement and helped to popularise the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic dystopia]] genre, held the record for the biggest profit-to-cost ratio for several years until it was broken by ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20483133_20828245_30188940,00.html|title=Summer Sleepers: 14 Unexpected Movie Hits|author=Lanford Beard|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[independent film]] ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', which played over the course of fall 1978 through fall 1979 and relied almost completely on word-of-mouth as marketing, was also a sleeper hit, having a box-office take of $70&amp;nbsp;million on a budget of only $325,000. Its success caused other [[slasher films]] to try the same approach, although few fared as well since horror films heavily rely on opening weekend box-office and quickly fall from theaters. Other notable examples of horror sleeper-hits to follow in ''Halloween'''s wake include ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' in 1984, ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' in 1996, ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' in 1999, ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' in 2004, and ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'' in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kerswell|first1=J.A.|title=The slasher movie book|date=2012|publisher=Chicago Review Press|location=Chicago, Ill.|isbn=1556520107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In music ==
Don Howard's 1952 recording of "[[Oh Happy Day (1952 song)|Oh Happy Day]]" was one of the earliest sleeper hits. Featuring only Howard's baritone vocals and his acoustic guitar played at an amateur level, it was initially released regionally and was never expected to become a hit. A massive groundswell of support from teenagers in Howard's home base of [[Cleveland]], Ohio led to the song rapidly rising in popularity,&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,889646,00.html?iid=digg_share |title=Mystery Hit – |date=9 February 1953 |work=Time |accessdate=9 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite music industry scorn;&lt;ref name="Galvestonfeb53"&gt;{{cite news |title=No One Likes 'Happy Day' Except Public |author =  Richard N. Smith |date=19 February 1953  |work=[[Galveston Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cover version]]s (including one by [[Larry Hooper]] and the [[Lawrence Welk]] orchestra) were quickly rushed into production, and by 1953, there were no fewer than four hit recordings of the same song circulating, including Howard's original.

[[The Romantics]]' 1980 single "[[What I Like About You (song)|What I Like About You]]" was a sleeper hit. It was a minor hit upon its release and charted at number 49 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the United States, while not charting at all in the United Kingdom.

'''''The Great Sirens''''' ({{Lang-fr|'''Les grandes sirènes'''}}) is a large 1947 painting by the Belgian painter [[Paul Delvaux]] in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name="met"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/481994|title=The Great Sirens|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture depicts a group of partially nude women in moonlight, sitting motionless before a hill bearing two Greco-Roman style buildings. According to the description from the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the setting "reveals the painter's admiration of the work of [[Giorgio de Chirico]]". The women in the foreground are unashamedly, if not threateningly, seductive and in the distance mermaids are working their magic on a lone individual in a bowler hat. The whole composition evokes fantasies of erotic love.&lt;ref name="met"/&gt;

The work is currently (2018) not on view.

==Provenance==
The painting was first exhibited at the Galerie René Drouin in Paris on 5 March 1948. It was bought by the dramatist Claude Spaak in 1949, after which it was sold several times to different collectors in Brussels. The American music producer [[Jean Aberbach]] bought it in 1967. He then traded it with his brother [[Julian Aberbach]], who wanted this painting and works by [[René Magritte]] in exchange for some sculptures by [[Alberto Giacometti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Biszick-Lockwood|first=Bar|year=2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uAwGCtXPvMgC&amp;pg=PA282|title=Restless Giant: The Life and Times of Jean Aberbach and Hill and Range Songs|location=[[Urbana, Illinois]]|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|p=282|isbn=978-0-252-03507-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julian Aberbach gave ''The Great Sirens'' to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1979.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt;

'''''The Merry Drinker''''' is a painting by [[Frans Hals]], from 1628-1630.
==Description==
The painting has dimensions  81 x 66.5 centimeters. It is in the collection of the [[Rijksmuseum]], [[Amsterdam]].

==Analysis==
The painting shows a man wearing a leather jerkin, lace collar and cuffs, and a floppy hat tipped at an angle. He is gesturing with his right hand and holding a glass of white wine in his left hand. He seems caught in a moment of discussion with the viewer. A medallion dangles from his neck chain, which [[Hofstede de Groot]] claimed was a likeness of Prince [[Maurice of Orange]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn03hofsuoft#page/18/mode/1up Catalog nr. 63], ''A Catalogue Raisonné of the Works of the Most Eminent Dutch Painters of the Seventeenth century Based on the work of John Smith'', Volume III (Frans Hals and Adriaen &amp; Isaac van Ostade), by Cornelis Hofstede de Groot, with the assistance of Kurt Freise and Dr. Kurt Erasmus, translated by Edward G. Hawke, Macmillan &amp; Co., London, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;  Various experts have claimed the painting represents the sense of taste. In old Dutch inventories, the theme of a "merry drinker" or "jolly toper" occurs often, and this was probably not a portrait but meant as a genre piece.

'''The Monument to the Unknown Soldier''' ([[Arabic]]: '''نصب الجندي المجهول''') is a monument in central [[Baghdad]] built by Italian architect, Marcello D'Olivo, based on a concept by Iraqi sculptor, [[Khaled al-Rahal]], and constructed between 1979 and 1982. It was dedicated to the martyrs of the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. In 1986 the national square of Iraq, [[Great Celebrations square]], was built near the monument, and two other monuments were built close to the square in memory of the matyrs. In 1983, the [[Al-Shaheed Monument]] on the River, was opened and in 1989 the newly built [[Victory Arch]] became the entrances to the square. The ''Unknown Soldier's Monument'' represents a traditional shield (dira¹a) dropping from the dying grasp of an Iraqi warrior. The monument also houses an underground museum.

==Background==

The ''Monument to the Unknown Soldier'' was commissioned in 1979 and completed in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S., ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture,'' Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of a broader Ba'athist government program to build a number of public works that would help instil a sense of national pride, and at the same time immortalise [[Saddam Hussein]]'s reputation as a powerful leader. Saddam turned to  his favourite artist, Khaled al-Rahal, who did more than any other Iraqi artist to incorporate ancient motifs in his work,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, B.A. and Feldman, M.H. (eds), ''Critical Approaches to Ancient Near Eastern Art,''Walter de Gruyter, 2014 p.xix&lt;/ref&gt; to devise the concept for the monument.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S., ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture,'' Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 251; Baghdad Writers Group, ''Baghdad and Beyond,'' Middle East Editorial Associates, 1985, p. 43; Borden, I. and Hall, R., ''The City Cultures Reader,''Psychology Press, 2000, p. 104; Makiya, K. and Al-Khalilm S., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Saddam Hussein's Iraq,'' IB Taurus, 2004, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the construction of the ''Monument to the Unknown Soldier,''  another colossal structure, the ''[[Al-Shaheed Monument]]'' (1983) was opened in the same area, and Saddam commissioned a third monument, the ''[[Victory Arch]],'' another concept, also by the sculptor, Khaled Al-Rahal, to be built in the same vicinity (commenced in 1983 and completed in 1989 after the sculptor's death). The three monuments form a visual and psychological unit, and all represent the pain and suffering of the eight-year war.&lt;ref&gt;Makiya, K. and Al-Khalilm S., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Saddam Hussein's Iraq,''  p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The original concept was the work of Iraqi sculptor, Khaled al-Rahal,&lt;ref&gt;Makiya, K. and Al-Khalilm S., ''The Monument: Art and Vulgarity in Saddam Hussein's Iraq,'' IB Taurus, 2004, p. x and p. 74; Rohde, A., ''State-Society Relations in Ba'thist Iraq: Facing Dictatorship,'' Routledge, 2010  p.120; King, E.A. and Levin, G., ''Ethics and the Visual Arts,'' Skyhorse Publishing, 2010, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; with the architectural designs developed by the Italian architect, Marcello D'Olivo.&lt;ref&gt;"Marcello D'Olivo (1921 - 1991)," in ''Dizionario Bigrafico dei Friulani,'' [http://www.dizionariobiograficodeifriulani.it/dolivo-marcello/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

The monument sits on top of an artificial hill, shaped like a low, truncated cone of 250&amp;nbsp;m diameter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/unknown-soldier-dg.htm GlobalSecurity.org "Monument to the Unknown Soldier, Baghdad, Iraq"]&lt;/ref&gt; The monument itself consists of several elements grouped on the hilltop. The centrepiece is a cantilevered dome, 42&amp;nbsp;m in diameter, with an inclination of 12 degrees and made of reinforced concrete. The dome represents a ''dira'a'' (Iraqi shield) falling from the grasp of a dying warrior.&lt;ref&gt;Pieri, C., " Modernity and its Posts in constructing an Arab capital: Baghdad’s urban space and architecture, context and questions," ''Middle East Studies Association Bulletin,'' The Middle East Studies Association of North America, 2009, Vol. 42, No. 1-2, p.4; Simonowitz, D,., "Head Trips: An Intertextual Analysis of Later Architecture and Sculpture Under Saddam Hussein," ''International Journal of Islamic Architecture,'' Vol. 1, No. 1, 2012, pp. 61-81, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1386/ijia.1.1.61_1&lt;/ref&gt;

At the side of the dome, is a spiral tower, which is reminiscent of the minaret at [[Samarra]]. Its external surface is clad with copper, while its inner surface features a [[soffit]] finished with pyramidal modules alternating steel and copper. The promenade is covered by a semi-circular, flat roof supported on a triangular steel bracing. The roof is covered with a copper sheet and the soffit displays V-shaped panels of stainless steel and Murano glass.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S., ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture,'' Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; It is surrounded by slanting girders of triangular section that are covered with marble. Red granite, stepped platforms of elliptical form lead to the dome and cubic sculpture. The steel flagpole is entirely covered with [[Murano glass]] panels fixed on stainless steel arms and displaying the national flag colours.

Beneath the shield is a cube, made of seven layers of metal, said to represent the seven levels of [[Heaven|Jannah]] in the Islamic faith.  Inside the layers of metal are sheets of red acrylic, said to represent the blood of the slain Iraqi soldiers.  The cube itself is connected to the underground museum by a long shaft with windows that allow light to shine in from above. Inside the museum, visitors can look up at the ceiling and see through the openings leading to the cube above.

The monument appeared on the [[Iraqi dinar]] bank-note in the 1990-2003 series (pictured).

==First ''Unknown Soldier'' monumental arch==
[[File:Unknown Soldier Monument in Baghdad.jpg|thumb|left|The original ''Unknown Soldier Monument'' (1959) by [[Rifat Chadirji]]]]

The 1982 ''Monument to the Unknown Soldier'' was not the first of such monuments to be constructed in Baghdad. In 1959, an arched monument to the Unknown Soldier was erected in Baghdad's [[Firdos Square]]. It was designed by Iraqi architect, [[Rifat Chadirji]], and was a modern adaption of the [[Taq Kasra|arch of Ctesiphon]] in the ancient capital of the [[Parthian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernhardsson, M.T., "Visions of the Past: Modernizing the Past in 1950s Baghdad," in Sandy Isenstadt and Kishwar Rizvi, ''Modernism and the Middle East: Architecture and Politics in the Twentieth Century," University of Washington Press, 2008, p.92&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sketches of the design found at the Institute of Fine Arts in Baghdad, reveal the inspiration for the design which represents a mother bending over to pick up her martyred child.&lt;ref&gt;Younis, A., "Monuments (by) Architects (for) Governments," ''Di'van,'' December, 2016, pp 78-87; "Before Monument to the Unknown Soldier (1980-) there was the Unknown Soldier Monument (1961-1982)," ''Isqeena Magazine,'' 25 August, 2013, [http://isqineeha.tumblr.com/post/59363871467/before-monument-to-the-unknown-soldier Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; Described as a simple, symbolic, modernist structure, a comparison between the original and its later replacement illustrates the increasing level of abstraction and sophistication in Iraqi art during the period. 

The original was removed from al-Fardous Square to make way for a statue of Saddam Hussein in the early 1980s. The replacement statue was destroyed by the American forces after they captured Baghdad in 2003 while the world watched via television.&lt;ref&gt;King, E.A. and Levin, G., ''Ethics and the Visual Arts,'' Skyhorse Publishing, 2010, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; 

Reports that Chadirji had been invited to rebuild the monument circulated for many years, but no progress has been evident, and the elderly Chadirji has since emigrated to England, where he lives with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2009/05/03/71903.html "Famed Iraqi architect rebuilds Baghdad landmark"] Al Arabiya News, November 2, 2010, retrieved September 20 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Slav Epic''''' ({{lang-cs|Slovanská epopej}}) is a cycle of 20 large canvases painted by [[Czechs|Czech]] [[Art Nouveau]] painter [[Alfons Mucha]] between 1910 and 1928. The cycle depicts the mythology and history of Czechs and other [[Slavic peoples]]. In 1928, after finishing his monumental work, Mucha bestowed the cycle upon the city of [[Prague]] on condition that the city build a special pavilion for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epopej.cz/epopej_gb.html|title=The Slav Epic|work=[[Moravský Krumlov]]|accessdate=11 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727071856/http://epopej.cz/epopej_gb.html|archivedate=27 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="battle"/&gt; Prior to 2012, the work was a part of the permanent exhibition at the chateau in the town of [[Moravský Krumlov]] in the [[South Moravian Region]] of the [[Czech Republic]]. In 2012, all 20 works were moved and displayed together on the ground floor of the ''Veletržní Palace'' till 2016, in an exhibition organized by the [[National Gallery in Prague]] (exhibition catalogue: Alfons Mucha – Slovanská epopej).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kultura.idnes.cz/vytvarne-umeni.aspx?c=A120510_171508_vytvarneum_jaz|title=Muchově Epopeji to ve Veletržním paláci až nečekaně sluší|last=Hnátek|first=Václav |date=10 May 2012|work=iDnes|publisher=[[Mladá fronta DNES]]|language=Czech|accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Alphons Mucha spent many years working on ''The Slav Epic'' cycle, which he considered his life's masterwork. He had dreamed of completing such a series, a celebration of Slavic history, since the turn of the 20th century; however, his plans were limited by financial constraints. In 1909, he managed to obtain grants by an American philanthropist and keen admirer of the Slavic culture, [[Charles Richard Crane]].&lt;ref name=tyden&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/kultura/vytvarne-umeni/slovanska-epopej-na-ceste-do-prahy-muchovi-nepatri_172447.html|title=Slovanská epopej na cestě do Prahy. Muchovi nepatří|publisher=Týden.cz|accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began by visiting the places he intended to depict in the cycle: Russia, Poland and the Balkans, including the Orthodox monasteries of [[Mount Athos]]. Additionally, he consulted historians regarding details of historical events in order to ensure an accurate depiction. In 1910, he rented part of the castle in [[Zbiroh]] and began working on the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tn.nova.cz/zpravy/domaci/slovanska-epopej-se-zatim-stehovat-nebude-rozhodl-soud.html|title=Slovanská epopej se zatím stěhovat nebude. Krumlovští se brání|work=TV Nova|language=Czech|accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mucha continued working on the cycle for 18 years, gradually submitting paintings to the city of Prague as he completed them. In 1919, the first part of the series comprising eleven canvases was displayed in the Prague's [[Clementinum]]. In 1921, five of the paintings were shown in New York and Chicago to great public acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sayer|first=Derek|title=The Coasts of Bohemia: A Czech History|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, the complete cycle was displayed for the first time in the Trade Fair Palace in Prague, the Czechoslovak capital.

Alfons Mucha died in July, 1939. Shortly before his death he was interrogated by the [[Gestapo]], as he was an important exponent of public life in [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/article/37455|title=Alfons Mucha|last=Carey|first=Nick|date=9 February 2000|publisher=Radio Prague|accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, the ''Slav Epic'' was wrapped and hidden away to prevent seizure by the Nazis.&lt;ref name="battle"/&gt;

Following the [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948]] and subsequent communist takeover of the country, Mucha was considered a decadent and bourgeois artist, estranged from the ideals of [[socialist realism]].&lt;ref name=rozhlas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rozhlas.cz/cro6/komentare/_zprava/763677|title=Slovanská epopej v mlhách|last=Konrád|first=Ondřej|date=26 July 2010|publisher=Český rozhlas 6|language=Czech|accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building of a special pavilion for the exposition of the Slav Epic cycle became irrelevant and unimportant for the new communist regime.&lt;ref name=rozhlas/&gt; After the war, the paintings were moved to the chateau at Moravský Krumlov by a group of local patriots, and the cycle went on display there in 1963.&lt;ref name="battle"/&gt;

== Controversy ==
The city of Prague has waged a decade-long legal battle over the work which intensified in early 2010.&lt;ref name="battle"/&gt; Much consideration has been given to relocating the Slav Epic from Moravský Krumlov (where it had been displayed for almost 50 years), to Prague. The hope was that Prague, a city frequented by many thousands of tourists, would attract increased attention to the series of paintings. However, there is no suitable space for the work in Prague's galleries. Therefore, some Czech state institutions, such as the Office of the [[Václav Klaus|President of the Czech Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/do-sporu-o-epopej-se-vlozil-klaus-chce-aby-zustala-na-morave-p45-/domaci.asp?c=A100728_173206_domaci_jw|title=Do sporu o epopej se vložil Klaus. Chce, aby zůstala na Moravě|publisher=[[iDNES]].cz|work=Mladá fronta DNES |location=Czech Republic|language=Czech|accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; found it preferable to leave the paintings in their current location since there have been few problems there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/kultura/vytvarne-umeni/muchova-slovanska-epopej-do-prahy-zatim-nepresidli_104790.html Muchova Slovanská epopej do Prahy zatím nepřesídlí]; [[Týden]].cz ''(in Czech)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://brno.idnes.cz/muchova-slovanska-epopej-stale-nema-v-praze-misto-dalsi-jednani-se-chysta-na-rijen-gio-/brno-zpravy.asp?c=A090909_171620_brno_trr Muchova Slovanská epopej stále nemá v Praze místo, další jednání se chystá na říjen]; [[iDnes]].cz ''(in Czech)''&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in early 2010, the city of Prague requested the return of the Slav Epic for restoration work and subsequent display.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio.cz/cz/clanek/130019 Loss of Mucha art work likely to hit small Moravian town hard]; Radio.cz&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Mucha Foundation, run by the artist's grandson John Mucha and his mother Geraldine, blocked the move as it would simply be a provisional measure.&lt;ref name="battle"/&gt; The City of Prague argued that not Alfons Mucha but [[Charles R. Crane]] was the owner of the paintings and that he has donated the cycle to the City of Prague. According to the newspaper [[Mladá fronta DNES]], the information was proved by contracts found in the city archives.&lt;ref name=tyden/&gt; The Foundation is in talks with the City of Prague for the construction of a permanent home for the work.&lt;ref name="battle"/&gt;

On 25 July 2010, over a thousand people gathered in Moravský Krumlov to protest the planned move of ''The Slav Epic'' from the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brno.idnes.cz/proti-stehovani-epopeje-protestovalo-v-moravskem-krumlove-tisic-lidi-1mj-/brno-zpravy.asp?c=A100725_164201_brno-zpravy_bor|title=Proti stěhování epopeje protestovalo v Moravském Krumlově tisíc lidí|work=Mladá fronta DNES |location=Czech Republic|language=Czech|accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a two-year dispute between Prague and the Moravian town of Moravský Krumlov, the renowned cycle of 20 monumental canvases was—in a move protested by conservationists and art historians alike—taken for display at the National Gallery's Veletržní Palace in 2012 and remained there until the end of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mucha’s "Slav Epic" moved to Prague without approval|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Mucha-s-Slav-Epic-moved-to-Prague-without-approval/26284}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, ''The Slav Epic'' was shown in Brno during the RE:PUBLIKA Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gotobrno.cz/en/festival/republika-festival/|title=RE:PUBLIKA Festival –  – Go To Brno|date=27 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exhibition combines two opposing worlds of renowned Art Nouveau artist Alfons Mucha’s works – the majestic Slav Epic and a unique collection of posters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gotobrno.cz/en/actions/slovanska-epopej-slav-epic/|title=Alfons Mucha: Two worlds – Go To Brno|date=21 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Professor Tsion Avital.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Tsion Avital]]
'''Tsion Avital''' (born February 21, 1940) is an [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[philosopher of art]] and culture.

==Biography==

Tsion Avital was born to Avraham and Preciada Dorit Avitbol Avital, and grew up in the town of [[Sefrou]] in Morocco.  Avital immigrated to Israel with his family in January 1951, when he was eleven.  His higher education from [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] through PhD was at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. His B.A.was in philosophy and [[psychology]], his [[Master of Arts|MA]] in philosophy, focusing on aesthetics and with complementary studies in the Department of [[Art History]]. His [[Master's thesis]] was on "An Outline of Artonomy," (the concept "Artonomy" is explained below), under the supervision of Professors [[Yehuda Elkana]] and [[Eddy Zemach]]. He received his doctorate in 1974. During his doctoral studies he spent 1971–1972 at the [[University of Toronto]] in Canada, where he performed a series of experiments which verified his hypotheses on the possibility of a structural paradigm in art. His [[doctoral dissertation]] was on "Artonomy: a new type of art and its implications for art education in the future" (1974). This research was done under the supervision of Professors Daniel Berlyne and Anatol Rapoport of the University of Toronto, and Professor Moshe Caspi of Hebrew University.

In 1973 Avital was appointed lecturer at Hebrew University, and in 1976 he resigned from the university. Since the universities as well as other colleges recoiled from his ideas on art, he was unable to obtain employment in his field in any academic institution in Israel, and so for five years he managed a rubber and plastics plant in the Holon Industrial Zone. In 1982 he began teaching at the Faculty of Design at HIT, the [[Holon Institute of Technology]]. In 1997 he was appointed Senior Lecturer, in 1999 was granted tenure and in 2003 appointed [[Full Professor]], with no prior appointment as Associate Professor. In 2011 he retired as [[Emeritus Professor]] at the Holon Technological Institute.
&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsion Avital is divorced and has three children.

==Research==
In his [[doctoral dissertation]] Avital claimed that modern art or, all visual non-[[representational art]], both in painting and sculpture, is not art at all, because its works are completely arbitrary compositions, and so they lack a systemic structure which has been the central characteristic of art in the 40,000 years of its existence. He claimed that in order to revive art, a new type of art is needed, that would restore a systemic structure to art, but without returning to [[figurative art]] which had been exhausted. He called this art "Artonomy".  Actually, from a higher point of view, figurative art and artonomy are the two sides of the same coin: one semantically or content oriented and the other structure oriented.
&lt;ref&gt;
Avital, 1997a
&lt;/ref&gt;
The decisive importance he attributes to the [[hierarchical structure]] in art derives from the fact that hierarchy is a universal ordering relation, and is the most general principle of order existing in the universe at all levels: macro and micro, in the physical, biological, social and [[noetics|noetic]] world.

Avital thinks that [[Figurative art]] served as an adequate and comprehensible depiction of things, real or fictitious, for tens of thousands of years just because it represented things in the world in a hierarchical order employing self-embedded pictorial symbols. From the moment that hierarchical order was erased from art, it also ceased to be a medium for the depiction of reality or anything else, and became arbitrary daubing of paint or at best, trivial graphic design. We have no difficulty in understanding prehistoric art from 32,000 years ago, but we are unable to understand any "abstract" painting made today.
Avital's central research hypothesis was that if we expose test subjects who know nothing of systemic thought to a set of non-figurative paintings whose relationship is systemic, the subjects would be able to identify the correct order of the pictures comprising the system even if these were presented to them in random order. The [[hypothesis]] was tested in three different experiments, all of which showed that indeed subjects with no prior knowledge of the subject succeeded, [[consciously]] or [[unconsciously]], in reconstructing the correct order of the visual systems that had been presented to them in a random order which differed for each subject. The tests results confirmed Avital's hypothesis above all expectation, 
&lt;ref&gt;
Avital and Cupchik, 1998a
&lt;/ref&gt;
thus indirectly supporting avial's mindprints theory. 
&lt;ref&gt;
Avital, 1996, 1997b, 1998c, 2003, chapter 5
&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the years 1974–1985 Avital initiated a number of exhibitions in Israel in which the principles of Artonomy in various arts were demonstrated, by Avital as well as other artists. It is worth noting that while all scholars who employ structuralism in their fields use it as an explicative method.
&lt;ref&gt;
Levi-Strauss, (1963)  
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;
Piaget, (1973)
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;
Chomsky, (1968)
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;
Piaget, (1973)
&lt;/ref&gt;
Avital argue that artonomy seem to be the only case in which structuralism is applied for both; explicative and generative method in art.
Before the formulation of artonomy by Avital, there was a premature attempt to introduce systemic thinking in art. In 1966 the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in New York presented an exhibition entitled "Systemic Art".
&lt;ref&gt;
Alloway, 1966
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;
Bochner 1968
&lt;/ref&gt;

Avital argue that the terms "system" and "systemic" were used without being understood, as so often happens in art. All the works presented at the exhibition were at most series rather than systems. Indeed, in any system a serial effect may exist, but not every series constitutes a system. The difference is that there is no necessary connection between constituents of a series, but there is a necessary connection between all constituents of a system. An additional difference is that in a series there is no necessary layering between constituents of the series, while in a system there necessarily exists layering between constituents of the system.
Claiming that visual non-figurative art, or simply, "abstract" art, is not art, made it obligatory for Avital to propose a sound characterization of true art but he found none in the history of aesthetics. After his total disillusionment with aesthetics theory and years of groping in the dark with no solution, Avital decided to look in a completely different direction: to investigate in [[prehistory]] how art was born, in the hope that in its fetal stages it would be easier to discern its most basic characteristics.  After over twenty years of groping in the dark with no solution, a significant turning point for him was the discovery by [[Mary Leakey]]
&lt;ref&gt;
Mary Leakey, 1979a
&lt;/ref&gt;
and other researchers who discussed the discovery of a trail of [[footprints]] left by [[hominids]] in [[Laetoli]], in the north of [[Tanzania]], 3.8&amp;nbsp;million years ago. These footprints show a remarkable phenomenon: on the path at one time a male, a female and a child walked and the latter, as a game, made sure to step only in the footprints of the male ahead of him, even though his strides were much longer. This paper and about a hundred other papers discussing these footprints treat solely various physiological aspects of these hominids. But for Avital this finding was the key to some insights regarding the cognitive make-up of these hominids and to answer two fundamental questions: the graphic origins of art, as well as the cognitive-structural qualities necessary for something to be a work of art.
 
In his paper "Footprints Literacy: The Origins of Art and Prelude to Science" 
&lt;ref&gt;
Avital,1998a
&lt;/ref&gt;

Avital showed that hominids about four million years ago apparently knew how to read footprints, something no other creature is able to do to this day save humans. Second, he showed why reading of footprints is apparently the origin of painting, as well as the first case where meta-structures of the mind find expression. Thus Avital has anchored the origins and meaning of art in mind itself and in this respect his theory is very different from other well-known theories as those presented by [[Henri Breuil|Breuil]], [[Ernst Gombrich|Gombrich]], Davis.
&lt;ref&gt;
Breuil,1981
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;
Gombrich, 1962
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;
Davis, 1986a 
&lt;/ref&gt;

The same meta-structures of mind or mindprints reappear along the evolution of culture: tool making, language and all of the cultural domains but on ever higher levels of abstraction. Understanding of the cognitive mechanisms necessary for reading the footprints led to Avital's most important finding: mindprints theory and they are the central axis of all his life's research. Avital assumes that these are the basic organizational structural tools of the mind, and find expression in all branches of culture through all time, and that apparently these organizational structures, at some level, exist in plants and animals as well. Avital claims that these mindprints that were necessary to read footprints four million years ago, and are necessary today to read footprints, are the same qualities necessary for making stone tools, prehistoric art, language and its derivatives, technology and science.

'''A tentative table of mindprints''':

1. Connectivity–Disconnectivity (Codis) (Unity–Plurality)

2. Open-Endedness–Closed-Endedness

3. Recursiveness (Recurrence)–Singularity (“One-off")

4. Transformation–Invariance

5. Hierarchy–Randomness (Anti-hierarchy, Disorder)

6. Symmetry–Asymmetry

7. Negation–Affirmation (Double Negation)

8. Complementarity–Mutual Exclusiveness

9. Comparison–Imparison (No Comparison?)

10. Determinism–Indeterminism (Probability, Selection, Choice)

Over time, the level of abstraction and sophistication in the application of these patterns became more and more complex. Similarly, awareness of the existence of these organizational patterns grew throughout the development of culture. In this paper Avital claims that the [[evolution of culture]] is to a large extent the evolution of levels of application of mindprints. To make the matter concrete, he demonstrates and compares the appearance of mindprints in reading footprints 3.8&amp;nbsp;million years ago: [[prehistoric art]] from its beginning 40,000 years ago, and modern science today. In contrast, in [[modern art]] these organizational patterns are in part lacking, and in part appear in a distorted or ruined condition. That is, in modern art the structural skeleton that held art together over tens of thousands of years is lacking, and therefore this is not art at all, but rather the debris of the figurative art which modernism broke into shreds. For example, the footprint of a [[deer]] of some particular age, sex and physical condition relates or connects all deer of the same kind, but also differentiates them from other animals. The prehistoric painting of a horse relates all horses of the same kind, but also separates them from other animals. Newton's law of gravity shows the force of attraction between any two masses as a function of the magnitude of their masses and the square of the distance between them. In contrast, argue Avital, [[abstract art]] does not relate any things, but is a special case of a mass of colors and forms with no reference outside themselves. Similarly, one can show that all the other nine mindprints exist at a growing level of abstraction: in reading footprints, in [[figurative art]] and in science but not in modern art. Thus avital has anchored the nature of art in the nature of the meta-structures of mind .

==Works==
Avital's main work up to now is:
Avital.	T. (2003) '''[[Art versus Non art : Art out of Mind]].'''' Cambridge, 	[[Cambridge University Press]].

In the first part of this book Avital examines the question "Is modern art art?" He claims that all visual nonfigurative art created in the twentieth century and in the current century is not art. In this book Avital claims that art is in the first paradigmatic crisis in its history. He claims that [[modernism]] reduced art to [[arbitrary]] compositions of color and form, and thus in fact reduced art to design. Avital also argue why the art which is labeled [[abstract art|abstract]] is not abstract at all, and this is because the fathers of modernism did not understand the concept of abstraction. Avital criticizes the [[aesthetics|aesthetician]]s, and the art establishment, who "justified the misdeed," in his view: rather than defining art in a way that would enable distinction of art from non-art, they extended the concept of art with no limit until there was no one thing, including nothing, that could not be presented as art. This state of affairs is equivalent to a state of no art, for if everything is red and nothing is not red, then there is no red.

The second part of the book presents the theory of mindprints, and shows how it can be applied in order to distinguish in a fairly clear manner between art and pseudo-art. He argues extensively how each mindprint, such as Connectivity-Disconnectivity, Symmetry-Asymmetry, Hierarchy-Randomness and others appear in every figurative painting but not in "abstract" painting. A particularly thorough discussion deals with hierarchical organization and its implications for art today and in the future. At the end of the book Avital presents a table of about fifty characteristics that existed in figurative art throughout its history, of which only two, color and form, appear in modern art as well. However these two characteristics are at most a necessary but not sufficient condition for something to be a work of art. These two characteristics are barely sufficient for something to be trivial graphic design but not art.

To sum up: There is a skintight and immanent connection between all the stages of Avital’s life-time work: a. The preliminary argument that modern art is not art because it has demolished the hierarchical framework of art and therefore lost also its referential function. b. The proposal that artonomy as structural art can restore hierarchical structure in art without returning to figurative art. c. the discovery of mindprints theory which reveals the structural infra-structure of all domains of culture, including true art, and thus enabling us to distinguish between art and nonart.

The Wild Zappers also occasionally tour and dance with the National Deaf Dance Theatre. Videos of Wild Zappers performing can be watched on [[YouTube]].

The Wild Zappers have two main workshops focusing on American Sign Language and Deaf culture education.  "Sign Me a Story" was developed for elementary aged children.  "Let's Sign and Dance" is targeted towards families and teaches how Deaf people perform along with American Sign Language.

== Organization ==
'''Invisible Hands Inc.'''

Fred Beam founded Invisible Hands, Inc. to promote Deaf culture awareness.  This non-profit organization recruits groups like the Wild Zappers who want to promote Deaf culture through the arts.  They also provide professional training to educate the Deaf to find employment in the arts field.  The Wild Zappers and National Deaf Dance Theater are sponsored by Invisible Hands, Inc.&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://invisiblehands.com/?page_id=5|work=About Us|publisher=Invisible Hands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Michael Rossetti''' (25 September 1829 &amp;ndash; 5 February 1919) was an English writer and critic.

==Biography==
Born in London, he was a son of immigrant Italian scholar [[Gabriele Rossetti]] and his wife [[Frances Polidori|Frances Rossetti ''née'' Polidori]], and the brother of [[Maria Francesca Rossetti]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Christina Rossetti|Christina Georgina Rossetti]].

He was one of the seven founder members of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] in 1848, and became the movement's unofficial organizer and bibliographer. He edited the Brotherhood's literary magazine ''[[The Germ (periodical)|The Germ]]'' which published four issues in 1850 and wrote the poetry reviews for it.

It was William Michael Rossetti who recorded the aims of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood at their founding meeting in September 1848:

#To have genuine ideas to express;
#To study Nature attentively, so as to know how to express them;
#To sympathize with what is direct and serious and heartfelt in previous art, to the exclusion of what is conventional and self-parading and learned by rote;
#And most indispensable of all, to produce thoroughly good pictures and statues.&lt;ref&gt;Rossetti, William Michael. &lt;em&gt;Dante Gabriel Rossetti. His Family-Letters with a Memoir&lt;/em&gt;. (London: Ellis, 1895), p. 135. (http://www.rossettiarchive.org/docs/pr5246.a43.rad.html)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Rossetti worked full-time as a civil servant, he maintained a prolific output of criticism and biography across a range of interests from [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Algernon Swinburne]] to [[James McNeill Whistler]]. He edited the diaries of his maternal uncle [[John Polidori|John William Polidori]] (author of ''[[The Vampyre]]'' and physician to [[Lord Byron]]), a comprehensive biography of D. G. Rossetti, and edited the collected works of D. G. Rossetti and Christina Rossetti.

Rossetti edited the first British edition of the poetry of [[Walt Whitman]], which was published in 1868; however, this edition was [[bowdlerize]]d.&lt;ref name="leavesofgrassessays"&gt;{{Citation

In 1874 he married [[Lucy Madox Brown]], daughter of the painter [[Ford Madox Brown]]. They honeymooned in France and Italy. Their first child, [[Olivia Rossetti Agresti|Olivia Frances Madox]], was born in September 1875, and her birth was celebrated in an ode of Swinburne's. A son, Gabriel Arthur, was born in February 1877, followed by another daughter, Helen Maria, in November 1879, and twins, Mary Elizabeth and Michael Ford, in April 1881. Their son Michael died in infancy. Rossetti and his wife did not have the children baptized, nor were they raised in a Christian household. The children were schooled at home by their mother and governesses. In 1897, Olivia married an Italian anarchist refugee, Antonio Agresti. They later moved to Italy, where Olivia became a translator and writer. After she was widowed in 1926, she became an associate of [[Ezra Pound]], and the two corresponded frequently.

Gabriel Arthur, known as Arthur to the family, became a scientist, married Dora Lewis, and had several children. Helen became a painter of miniatures, and in 1903 married Gastone Angeli. He was in fragile health and died only a few months later. Helen gave birth to his posthumous daughter, Imogen Lucy, in 1904.

William Michael Rossetti was a major contributor to the 1911 edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''; his contributions on artistic subjects were criticised by many reviewers at the time and since, as showing little evidence of having absorbed the mounting body of work by academic [[art historian]]s, mostly writing in German. Below is a quotation from his article on [[Fra Angelico]] demonstrating his literary and art-historical style.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The "pietistic" quality of Fra Angelico's work is in fact its predominant characteristic. The faces of his figures have an air of rapt suavity, devotional fervency and beaming esoteric consciousness, which is intensely attractive to some minds ... the faces becoming sleek and prim, with a smirk of sexless religiosity which hardly eludes the artificial or even the hypocritical; because of this, there are some who are not moved by his work.
