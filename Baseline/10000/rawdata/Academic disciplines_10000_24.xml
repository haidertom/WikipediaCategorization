      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38080">[[Aging]] has a significant impact on [[society]]. People of different ages tend to differ in many aspects, such as legal and social responsibilities, outlooks on life, and self-perceptions. Young people tend to have fewer legal privileges (if they are below the [[age of majority]]), they are more likely to push for political and social change, to develop and adopt new technologies, and to need education. Older people have different requirements from society and government, and frequently have differing values as well, such as for property and pension rights.&lt;ref name="Vincent 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1468-4446.2005.00084.x |title=Understanding generations: Political economy and culture in an ageing society |year=2005 |last1=Vincent |first1=John A. |journal=The British Journal of Sociology |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=579–99 |pmid=16309437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older people are also more likely to vote, and in many countries the young are forbidden from voting. Thus, the aged have comparatively more, or at least different, political influence.&lt;ref name="Powell 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12126-010-9051-6 |title=The Power of Global Aging |year=2010 |last1=Powell |first1=Jason L. |journal=Ageing International |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In different societies, age may be viewed or treated differently. For example, age may be measured starting from conception or from birth, and starting at either age zero or age one. Transitions such as reaching [[puberty]], age of majority, or [[retirement]] are often socially significant. The concepts of [[successful aging]] and [[healthy aging]] refer to both social and physical aspects of the aging process.&lt;ref name="Rowe1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name='strawbridge'/&gt;

== Cultural variations ==
[[File:Elderly Woman , B&amp;W image by Chalmers Butterfield.jpg|thumb|right|An elderly woman]]
{{refimprove section|date=June 2012}}
Arbitrary divisions set to mark periods of life may include: [[Minor (law)|juvenile]] (via [[Infant|infancy]], [[childhood]], [[preadolescence]], [[adolescence]]), [[Emerging adulthood and early adulthood|early adulthood]], [[Middle age|middle adulthood]], and [[Senior citizen|late adulthood]]. More casual terms may include "teenagers," "[[Tween (demographic)|tween]]s," "twentysomething", "thirtysomething", etc. as well as "vicenarian", "tricenarian", "quadragenarian", etc.

The age of an adult human is commonly measured in whole years since the day of birth. Fractional years, months or even weeks may be used to describe the age of children and infants for finer resolution. The time of day the birth occurred is not commonly considered. In some cultures there are other ways to express age. For example, some cultures measure age by counting years including the current year, while others count years without including it. It could be said for the same person that he is twenty years old or that he is in the twenty-first year of his life. In Russian the former expression is generally used, the latter one has restricted usage: it is used for age of a deceased person in obituaries and for the age of an adult when it is desired to show him/her older than he/she is. (Psychologically, a woman ''in her 20th year'' seems older than one who is ''19 years old''.)  Other cultures that express age differently may not use years elapsed since birth at all.  Inuit culture is an example in which birthdays are not celebrated because maturity is not signified in terms of years.  The Navajo culture is another in which age is not counted through years elapsed from birth.  In this case, age is measured through certain milestones in a person's life, such as the first time they laugh.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogoff|first1=Barbara|title=The Cultural Nature of Human Development|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195131338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cultures where age is not measured by years since birth, most individuals do not know how old they are in years.  People in these cultures may find more importance in other aspects of their birth, such as the season, agricultural practices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bolin|first1=Inge|title=Growing Up in a Culture of Respect|date=January 2006|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-71298-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; or spiritual connections&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogoff|first1=Barbara|title=Developing Destinies:  A Mayan Midwife and Town|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking place when they were born.  A culture may also choose to place a greater emphasis on family lineage than age, as is done in Mayan society.  A Mayan adult would not determine a child's responsibility and status in terms of age by years, but instead by relative seniority to others in the family or community.

The main purpose of counting age in terms of years from birth is for the convenience of grouping individuals by age, as is needed in industrialized society.  The medical practices and compulsory schooling that resulted from industrialization factored largely into the need for counting age in terms of years since birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chudacoff|first1=Howard|title=How Old Are You?  Age Consciousness in American Culture|date=1989|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0-691-04768-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even in Westernized societies such as the United States, age in terms of years since birth did not begin until the mid-1800s.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt;

Depending on cultural and personal philosophy, ageing can be seen as an undesirable phenomenon, reducing beauty and bringing one closer to death; or as an accumulation of wisdom, mark of survival and a status worthy of respect.  In some cases numerical age is important (whether good or bad), whereas others find the stage in life that one has reached (adulthood, independence, marriage, retirement, career success) to be more important.

[[East Asian age reckoning]] is different from that found in [[Western culture]]. [[Traditional Chinese culture]] uses a different ageing method, called ''Xusui'' (虛歲) with respect to common ageing which is called ''Zhousui'' (周歲). In the ''Xusui'' method, people are born at age 1, not age 0, possibly because conception is already considered to be the start of the life span and possibly because the number [[Zero|'0']] was not historically present in Ancient China, {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} and another difference is the ageing day: ''Xusui'' grows up at the Spring Festival (aka. Chinese New Year's Day), while ''Zhousui'' grows up at one's birthday.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} In parts of Tibet, age is counted from conception i.e. one is usually 9 months old when one is born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DF-N_lXjlL8C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=japanese+%221+year+old%22+birth|title=The World Economy|first=Angus|last=Maddison|accessdate=28 June 2008|page=31|isbn=92-64-02261-9|year=2006|publisher=OECD|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Age in [[prenatal development]] is normally measured in [[gestational age]], taking the last [[menstruation]] of the mother as a point of beginning. Alternatively, [[fertilisation age]], beginning from [[fertilisation]] can be taken.

==Legal==
Most legal systems define a specific age for when an individual is allowed or obliged to do particular activities. These age specifications include [[voting age]], [[Legal drinking age|drinking age]], [[age of consent]], [[age of majority]], [[age of criminal responsibility]], [[marriageable age]], [[age of candidacy]], and [[mandatory retirement age]]. Admission to a movie for instance, may depend on age according to a [[motion picture rating system]]. A bus fare might be discounted for the young or old. Each nation, government and non-government organisation has different ways of classifying age.

Similarly, in many countries in [[jurisprudence]], the defence of infancy is a form of [[defence (legal)|defence]] by which a [[defendant]] argues that, at the time a law was broken, they were not liable for their [[Action (philosophy)|actions]] and thus should not be held liable for a crime. Many courts recognise that defendants who are considered to be [[juvenile (law)|juvenile]]s may avoid criminal prosecution on account of their age and in borderline cases the age of the offender is often held to be a mitigating circumstance.

==Political==
Older people have different requirements from society and government, and frequently have differing values as well, such as for property and pension rights.&lt;ref name="Vincent 2005"/&gt; Older people are also more likely to vote, and in many countries the young are forbidden from voting. Thus, the aged have comparatively more, or at least different, political influence.&lt;ref name="Powell 2010"/&gt;

Education tends to lose political significance for people as they age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cattaneo | first1 = M. Alejandra | last2 = Wolter | first2 = Stefan C. | title = Are the elderly a threat to educational expenditures? | journal = [[European Journal of Political Economy]] | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 225–236 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2008.10.002 | date = June 2009 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2008.10.002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coping and well-being ==
[[File:Elderly Gambian woman face portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Elderly [[Gambia]]n woman.]]
[[Psychology|Psychologists]] have examined [[coping skill]]s in the elderly. Various factors, such as [[social support]], religion and [[spirituality]], active engagement with life and having an internal [[locus of control]] have been proposed as being beneficial in helping people to cope with stressful life events in later life.&lt;ref name="pmid8694390"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.51.7.702 |title=A life span model of successful aging |year=1996 |last1=Schulz |first1=Richard |last2=Heckhausen |first2=Jutta |journal=American Psychologist |volume=51 |issue=7 |pages=702–14 |pmid=8694390}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17440126"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/geront/47.2.215 |title=The Role of Perceived Control in Explaining Depressive Symptoms Associated with Driving Cessation in a Longitudinal Study |year=2007 |last1=Windsor |first1=T.

[[Retirement]], a common transition faced by the elderly, may have both positive and negative consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Panek, Paul E. |author2=Hayslip, Bert |title=Adult development and aging|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=San Francisco|year=1989|isbn=0-06-045012-6|oclc=}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals in different wings in the same [[retirement home]] have demonstrated a lower risk of mortality and higher alertness and self-rated health in the wing where residents had greater control over their environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.34.2.191 |title=The effects of choice and enhanced personal responsibility for the aged: A field experiment in an institutional setting |year=1976 |last1=Langer |first1=Ellen J. |last2=Rodin |first2=Judith |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=191–8 |pmid=1011073}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.35.12.897 |title=Long-term effects of a control-relevant intervention with the institutionalized aged |year=1977 |last1=Rodin |first1=Judith |last2=Langer |first2=Ellen J. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=35 |issue=12 |pages=897–902 |pmid=592095}}&lt;/ref&gt; though personal control may have less impact on specific measures of health.&lt;ref name=Gilmer/&gt; Social control, perceptions of how much influence one has over one's social relationships, shows support as a [[moderator variable]] for the relationship between social support and perceived health in the elderly and may positively influence coping in the elderly.&lt;ref name=Bisconti1999&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/geront/39.1.94 |title=Perceived Social Control as a Mediator of the Relationships Among Social Support, Psychological Weil-Being, and Perceived Health |year=1999 |last1=Bisconti |first1=T. L. |last2=Bergeman |first2=C. S. |journal=The Gerontologist |volume=39 |pages=94–103 |pmid=10028775 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
Religion is an important factor used by the elderly in coping with the demands of later life and appears more often than other forms of coping later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Susan H. |last1=McFadden |chapter=Points of Connection: Gerontology and the Psychology of Religion |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=mGscSLMA_P4C&amp;pg=PA162 |pages=162–76 |editor1-first=Raymond F. |editor1-last=Paloutzian |editor2-first=Crystal L. |editor1-link=Raymond Paloutzian |editor2-last=Park |title=Handbook of the Psychology of Religion and Spirituality |publisher=Guiliford |isbn=978-1-57230-922-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Religiosity]] is a multidimensional variable; while participation in religious activities in the sense of participation in formal and organised [[ritual]]s may decline, it may become a more informal, but still important aspect of life such as through personal or private [[prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=618958 |year=1978 |last1=Mindel |first1=CH |last2=Vaughan |first2=CE |title=A multidimensional approach to religiosity and disengagement |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=103–8 |journal=Journal of Gerontology |doi=10.1093/geronj/33.1.103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-rated health ===
Positive [[Self-rated health|self-perception of health]] has been correlated with higher well-being and reduced mortality in the elderly.&lt;ref name=Idler2003&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/geront/43.3.372 |title=Discussion: Gender Differences in Self-Rated Health, in Mortality, and in the Relationship Between the Two |year=2003 |last1=Idler |first1=E.

A. |journal=The Gerontologist |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=369–71 |pmid=12810900}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various reasons have been proposed for this association; people who are objectively healthy may naturally rate their health better than that of their ill counterparts, though this link has been observed even in studies which have controlled for [[socioeconomic status]], psychological functioning and health status.&lt;ref name=Benyamini2003&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/geront/43.3.396 |title=Gender Differences in the Self-Rated Health-Mortality Association: Is It Poor Self-Rated Health That Predicts Mortality or Excellent Self-Rated Health That Predicts Survival? |year=2003 |last1=Benyamini |first1=Y. |last2=Blumstein |first2=T. |last3=Lusky |first3=A. |last4=Modan |first4=B. |journal=The Gerontologist |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=396–405; discussion 372–5 |pmid=12810904}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding is generally stronger for men than women,&lt;ref name=Deeg2003/&gt; though the pattern between genders is not universal across all studies and some results suggest sex-based differences only appear in certain age groups, for certain causes of mortality and within a specific sub-set of self-ratings of health.&lt;ref name=Benyamini2003/&gt;

Seniors’ subjective health remains relatively stable while objective health worsens with age.&lt;ref name=Kunz2000&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kunzmann|first1=Ute|last2=Little|first2=Todd D|last3=Smith|first3=Jacqui|title=Is age-related stability of subjective well-being a paradox? Cross-sectional and longitudional evidence from the Berlin Aging Study.|journal=Psychology and Aging|date=2000|volume=15|issue=3|pages=511–526|doi=10.1037/0882-7974.15.3.511}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it seems that the perceived health improves with age when objective health is controlled in the equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jylhä|first1=Marja|last2=Guralnik|first2=Jack M|last3=Balfour|first3=Jennifer|last4=Fried|first4=Linda P|title=Walking Difficulty, Walking Speed, and Age as Predictors of Self-Rated Health: The Women’s Health and Aging Study|journal=Journal of Gerontology|date=2001|volume=56A|issue=10|page=609|doi=10.1093/gerona/56.10.m609}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon is known as the paradox of ageing. People's expectations concerning health co-evolve with the health norms surrounding one's age. Elderly people often associate their functional and physical decline with the normal ageing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Idler|first1=Ellen L|title=Age differences in self-assessments of health: Age changes, cohort difference, or survivorship?|journal=Journal of Gerontology|date=1993|volume=48|issue=6|page=S289|doi=10.1093/geronj/48.6.s289}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williamson|first1=JD|last2=Fried|first2=LP|title=Characterization of older adults who attribute functional decrements to "old age".|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|date=1996|volume=44|issue=12|page=1429|doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.1996.tb04066.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elderly may actually enhance their perception of their own health through [[social comparison]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heckhausen|first1=Jutta|title=Developmental Regulation in Adulthood: Age-Normative and Sociostructural Constraints as Adaptive Challenges|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, the older people get, the more they may consider themselves in better health than their same-aged peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sargent-Cox|first1=Kerry|last2=Anstey|first2=Kaarin|last3=Luszcz|first3=Mary|title=Determinants of Self-Rated Health Items With Different Points of Reference|journal=Journal of Aging and Health|date=2008|volume=20|issue=6|pages=739–761|doi=10.1177/0898264308321035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the older a person becomes and the more their actual health declines, the greater the potential role is for social comparison processes to create a gap between a person's objective and subjective health.

=== Healthcare ===
Many societies in Western Europe and Japan have ageing populations. While the effects on society are complex, there is a concern about the impact on health care demand. The large number of suggestions in the literature for specific interventions to cope with the expected increase in demand for long-term care in ageing societies can be organised under four headings: improve system performance; redesign service delivery; support informal caregivers; and shift demographic parameters.&lt;ref name=Saltman2006&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2190/AUL1-4LAM-4VNB-3YH0 |title=The Impact of Aging on Long-Term Care in Europe and Some Potential Policy Responses |year=2006 |last1=Chawla |first1=Mukesh |last2=Dubois |first2=Hans F. W. |last3=Chawla |first3=Richard B. |journal=International Journal of Health Services |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=719–46 |pmid=17175843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the annual growth in national health spending is not mainly due to increasing demand from ageing populations, but rather has been driven by rising incomes, costly new medical technology, a shortage of health care workers and informational asymmetries between providers and patients.&lt;ref name=Rheinhardt2003&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.22.6.27 |title=Does the Aging of the Population Really Drive the Demand for Health Care? |year=2003 |last1=Reinhardt |first1=U. E. |journal=Health Affairs |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=27–39 |pmid=14649430}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of health problems become more prevalent as people get older. These include mental health problems as well as physical health problems, especially [[dementia]].

Even so, it has been estimated that population ageing only explains 0.2 percentage points of the annual growth rate in medical spending of 4.3 percent since 1970. In addition, certain reforms to the Medicare system in the United States decreased elderly spending on home health care by 12.5 percent per year between 1996 and 2000.&lt;ref name=Meara2004.&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.23.4.176 |title=Trends in Medical Spending by Age, 1963-2000 |year=2004 |last1=Meara |first1=E. |last2=White |first2=C. |last3=Cutler |first3=D. M. |journal=Health Affairs |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=176–83 |pmid=15318578}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would suggest that the impact of ageing populations on health care costs is not inevitable.

In United States prisons, medical costs for an ageing inmate could be above $100 per day as of July 2007, while typical inmates cost $33 per day. Most State [[Department of Corrections|DOCs]] report spending more than 10 percent of the annual budget on elderly care. That is expected to rise over the next 10–20 years. Some states have talked about releasing ageing inmates early.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aging Prisoners: Crisis in American Corrections|author = Aday, Ronald H.|publisher=Praeger|year=2003|isbn=0-275-97123-6}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Successful ageing ==
{{Main article|Successful ageing}}
[[File:Egypte louvre 105.jpg|thumbnail|Two men practising [[Tahtib]]. One of them is balding, suggesting vigorous activity at an advanced age.]]
The concept of ''successful ageing'' can be traced back to the 1950s and was popularised in the 1980s. Previous research into ageing exaggerated the extent to which health disabilities, such as [[diabetes]] or [[osteoporosis]], could be attributed exclusively to age and research in [[gerontology]] exaggerated the homogeneity of samples of elderly people.&lt;ref name='strawbridge'&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/geront/42.6.727 |title=Successful Aging and Well-Being: Self-Rated Compared with Rowe and Kahn |year=2002 |last1=Strawbridge |first1=W. J. |last2=Wallhagen |first2=M. I. |last3=Cohen |first3=R. D. |journal=The Gerontologist |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=727–33 |pmid=12451153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.3299702 |title=Human aging: Usual and successful |year=1987 |last1=Rowe |first1=J. |last2=Kahn |first2=R. |journal=Science |volume=237 |issue=4811 |pages=143–9 |pmid=3299702}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research shows that even late in life, potential exists for physical, mental, and social growth and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Papalia|first=Diane|title=Physical and Cognitive Development in Late Adulthood|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0073133809/student_view0/chapter17/|work=Human Development|publisher=Mc-Graw Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful ageing consists of three components:&lt;ref name="Rowe1997"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/geront/37.4.433 |title=Successful Aging |year=1997 |last1=Rowe |first1=J. W. |last2=Kahn |first2=R. L. |journal=The Gerontologist |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=433–40 |pmid=9279031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Low probability of disease or disability;
# High cognitive and physical function capacity;
# Active engagement with life.

A greater number of people self-report successful ageing than those that strictly meet these criteria.&lt;ref name=strawbridge/&gt;

Successful ageing may be viewed an interdisciplinary concept, spanning both [[psychology]] and [[sociology]], where it is seen as the transaction between society and individuals across the life span with specific focus on the later years of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=David L. |last1=Featherman |first2=Jacqui |last2=Smith |first3=James G. |last3=Peterson |chapter=Successful aging in a post-retired society |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=0oEJaiK30wUC&amp;pg=PA50 |pages=50–93 |editor1-first=Paul B. |editor1-last=Baltes |editor2-first=Margret M. |editor2-last=Baltes |year=1993 |title=Successful Aging: Perspectives from the Behavioral Sciences |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-43582-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "healthy ageing"&lt;ref name='strawbridge'/&gt;  and "optimal ageing" have been proposed as alternatives to successful ageing, partly because the term "successful ageing" has been criticised for making healthy ageing sound too competitive.

Six suggested dimensions of successful ageing include:&lt;ref name=Gilmer/&gt;

# No physical disability over the age of 75 as rated by a physician;
# Good subjective health assessment (i.e. good self-ratings of one's health);
# Length of undisabled life;
# Good [[mental health]];
# Objective [[social support]];
# Self-rated life satisfaction in eight domains, namely marriage, income-related work, children, friendship and social contacts, [[hobbies]], community service activities, religion and recreation/sports.

Numerous worldwide health, ageing and retirement surveys contain questions pertaining to pensions. The Meta Data Repository – created by the non-profit RAND Corporation and sponsored by the National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health – provides access to meta data for these questions as well as links to obtain respondent data from the originating surveys.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

== Ageing and communication ==
[[File:Hangbejaarden.jpg|thumb|left|Display of healthy communication between the elderly]]
Healthy ageing implies optimal well-being in spite of barriers resulting from age.&lt;ref&gt;Worrall, L.,&amp; Hickson, L. M. (2003). Theoretical foundations of communication disability in aging. In Linda E. Worrall &amp; Louise M. Hickson(Eds.). Communication disability in aging: from prevention to intervention (pp. 32-33). Clifton Park, NY: Delmar Learning, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The global population is ageing and will continue to have communication inabilities unless barriers of communication with the elderly are more highly promoted.&lt;ref name="Worrall, L. 2003 pp. 297-298"&gt;Worrall, L.,&amp; Hickson, L. M. (2003). Implications for theory, practice, and policy. In Linda E. Worrall &amp; Louise M. Hickson (Eds.). Communication disability in aging: from prevention to intervention (pp. 297-298). Clifton Park, NY: Delmar Learning, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Sensory impairments include hearing and vision deficits, which can cause communication barriers. Changes in cognition, hearing, and vision are easily associated with healthy ageing and can cause problems when diagnosing [[dementia]] and [[aphasia]] due to the similarities.&lt;ref name="Worrall, L. 2003 pp. 297-298"/&gt;

===Hearing loss===

[[File:Hearing aid 20080620.jpg|thumb|Hearing aid]]

[[Hearing loss]] is a common condition among ageing adults. Common conditions that can increase the risk of hearing loss in elderly people are high blood pressure, diabetes or the use of certain medications harmful to the ear.&lt;ref&gt;Worrall, L.,&amp; Hickson, L. M. (2003). Communication activity limitations. In Linda E. Worrall &amp; Louise M. Hickson(Eds.). Communication disability in aging: from prevention to intervention (pp. 141-142). Clifton Park, NY: Delmar Learning, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hearing aids]] are commonly referred to as personal amplifying systems, which can generally improve hearing by about 50%.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum, J. F. 1989"&gt;Nussbaum, J. F., Thompson, T. L., &amp; Robinson, J. D. (1989). Barriers to conversation. In Jon F. Nussbaum, Teresa Thompson, James D. Robinson (Eds.). Communication and aging (234-253).New York: Harper &amp; Row,1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Hearing loss among the aged community lessens elders' ability to compensate for other age related social and/or physical problems.&lt;ref name="Bayles, K. 1987 pp. 150-152"&gt;Bayles, K., Kaszniak, A., &amp; Tomoeda, C. (1987). Linguistic communication and normal aging. In communication and cognition in normal aging and dementia (pp. 150-152). Boston: Little, Brown and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Communication problems of elderly adults can be greatly impacted by mechanical problems such as: the translation of ideas into linguistic representation or expression, the perception of linguistic stimuli or the derivation of an idea from a given unit of disclosure. Changes in these mechanical problems are more important than changes in linguistic knowledge.&lt;ref name="Bayles, K. 1987 pp. 150-152"/&gt; The main goal of hearing aids is to improve communication and quality of life, not just to restore hearing. [[Presbycusis]] is an example of a hearing deficit that cannot be corrected by hearing aids.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum, J. F. 1989"/&gt; Presbycusis, the alteration of hearing sensitivity associated with normal hearing loss, is caused by the decreased amount of hair cells of the inner ear.&lt;ref name="Touhy, T. A. 2012"&gt;Touhy, T. A., Jett, K., Ebersole, P., &amp; Hess, P. A. (2012). Communicating with older adults. In Theris A. Touhy &amp; Kathleen (Eds.). Jett Ebersole &amp; Hess' toward healthy aging: human needs &amp; nursing response (96-98).St. Louis, Mo.: Elsevier/Mosby, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This is normally caused by long periods of distressing noise that diminish the hair cells which with increasing age will not grow back. [[Presbycusis]] and other such hearing-related problems promote social withdrawal, as individuals begin to lose touch with the world around them. Hearing loss among the aged community lessens elders' ability to compensate for other age-related social and/or physical problems.&lt;ref name="Touhy, T. A. 2012"/&gt; This impairment can cause elders to lose touch of social skills because they may have trouble keeping up with fast-paced or hearing different pitched voices in conversation.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum, J. F. 1989"/&gt;

===Visual impairment===

The interpretation of facial expressions and mouthing can be difficult to understand when an individual has a [[visual impairment]]. Such problems hinder the ability of people to understand stimuli and translate information pertaining to perception with their brain for analysis.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum, J. F. 1989"/&gt; [[Non-verbal communication]] is important in effective communication and elders with vision loss are more likely to misinterpret or read the other person's actions in a wrong way. Visual impairments also cause a loss in positive perceptions of the environment around them. This can lead to isolation and possible depression in elderly people.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum, J. F. 1989"/&gt; [[Macular degeneration]] is a common cause of vision loss in elderly people. It diminishes the macula of the eye, which is responsible for clear vision. It causes progressive loss of central vision and possible loss of colour vision.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum, J. F. 1989"/&gt; This degeneration is caused by systemic changes in the circulation of waste products and growth of abnormal vessels around the retina causing the photoreceptors not to receive proper images. Though ageing almost always causes this, other possible effects and risk factors include smoking, obesity, family history and excessive sunlight exposure.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum, J. F. 1989"/&gt;

=== Digital world ===
In a world increasingly relying on digital technologies, older adults face higher risks of social exclusion and prejudices (see [[Ageism|digital ageism]]).  Generational segregation naturalizes youth as digitally adept and the old as digitally inept. Older adults’ experiences are often excluded from research agendas on digital media.&lt;ref&gt;Loos, E. F., L. Haddon &amp; E. Mante-Meijer (2012), Generational use of new media. Farnham: Ashgate.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sawchuk, K., &amp; Crow, B. (2010).

Poppinga (ed.), Observing the mobile user experience: Proceedings of the 1st international workshop held in conjunction with NordiCHI (pp. 17–20). Oldenburg, Germany: HaptiMap.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political struggle against ageing ==
Though many scientists state that radical life extension, delaying and stopping ageing are achievable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientists' Open Letter on Aging Research |date=March 2, 2006 |url=http://www.cureaging.org/ |accessdate=2015-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060302211958/http://www.cureaging.org/ |archivedate=March 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Advocacy &amp; Research for Unlimited Lifespans
|url=http://www.longecity.org |accessdate=2015-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are still no international or national programmes focused on stopping ageing or on radical life extension.  There are political forces staying for and against life extension.  In 2012 the Longevity political parties started in Russia, then in the USA, Israel and the Netherlands.  These parties aim to provide political support to anti-ageing and radical life extension research and technologies and want to ensure the fastest possible and at the same time the softest societal transition to the next step: radical life extension and life without ageing, that will make it possible to provide the access to such technologies to the most of the currently living people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/07/a-single-issue-political-party-for-longevity-science.php{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social science of ageing ==
[[File:Sabaa Nissan Militiaman.jpg|thumb|right|An elderly [[Iraq]]i man.]]
*[[Disengagement theory]] is the idea that separation of older people from active roles in society is normal and appropriate, and benefits both society and older individuals. Disengagement theory, first proposed by Cumming and Henry, has received considerable attention in [[gerontology]], but has been much criticised.&lt;ref name=Stuart&gt;{{cite book|author =Stuart-Hamilton, Ian|title=The Psychology of Ageing: An Introduction|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|location=London|year=2006|isbn=1-84310-426-1|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cornwell Benjamin |author2=Laumann Edward O. |author3=Schumm L. Philip | year = 2008 | title = The Social Connectedness of Older Adults: A National Profile | url = | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 73 | issue = 2| pages = 185–203 | doi=10.1177/000312240807300201|pmc=2583428}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original data on which Cumming and Henry based the theory were from a rather small sample of older adults in Kansas City and from this select sample Cumming and Henry then took disengagement to be a universal theory.&lt;ref name=Willis/&gt; There are research data suggesting that the elderly who do become detached from society are those who were initially reclusive individuals and such disengagement is not purely a response to ageing.&lt;ref name=Stuart/&gt;
*[[Activity theory (aging)|Activity theory]], in contrast to disengagement theory, implies that the more active elderly people are, the more likely they are to be satisfied with life. The view that elderly adults should maintain well-being by keeping active has had a considerable history and since 1972, this has come to be known as activity theory.&lt;ref name=Willis/&gt; However, this theory may be just as inappropriate as disengagement for some people as the current paradigm on the psychology of ageing is that both disengagement theory and activity theory may be optimal for certain people in old age, depending on both circumstances and personality traits of the individual concerned.&lt;ref name=Stuart/&gt; There are also data which query whether, as activity theory implies, greater social activity is linked with well-being in adulthood.&lt;ref name=Willis/&gt;
*Selectivity theory mediates between the activity and disengagement theories, and suggests that it may benefit older people to become more active in some aspects of their lives, more disengaged in others.&lt;ref name=Willis&gt;{{cite book|author =Willis, Sherry L.|title=Adult development and aging|publisher=HarperCollins College Publishers|location=New York, NY|year=1996|isbn=0-673-99402-3|oclc=}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Continuity theory (aging)|Continuity theory]] is the view that in ageing people are inclined to maintain, as much as they can, the same habits, personalities and styles of life that they have developed in earlier years. Continuity theory is Atchley's theory that individuals, in later life, make adaptations to enable them to gain a sense of continuity between the past and the present and the theory implies that this sense of continuity helps to contribute to well-being in later life.&lt;ref name=Bowling/&gt; Disengagement theory, activity theory and continuity theory are social theories about ageing, though all may be products of their era rather than a valid, universal theory.

===Other definitions===
As [[cyborg]]s currently are on the rise some theorists argue there is a need to develop new definitions of aging and for instance a bio-techno-social definition of aging has been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wejbrandt A | year = 2014 | title = Defining aging in cyborgs: A bio-techno-social definition of aging | url = | journal = Journal of Aging Studies | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 104–109 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaging.2014.09.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Archivist Survey.jpg|right|thumb|An archivist surveying an unprocessed collection of materials. Surveying is commonly done to determine priorities for preservation and/or conservation of materials before an archivist begins arrangement and description.]]
An '''archivist''' (''AR-kiv-ist'') is an information professional who assesses, collects, organizes, preserves, maintains control over, and provides access to [[Document|record]]s and [[archive]]s determined to have long-term value. The records maintained by an archivist can consist of a variety of forms, including letters, diaries, logs, other personal documents, government documents, sound and/or picture recordings, digital files, or other physical objects.

==Description==
As [[Richard Pearce-Moses]] wrote:

:"Archivists keep records that have enduring value as reliable memories of the past, and they help people find and understand the information they need in those records."&lt;ref&gt;Pearce-Moses, Richard. "Identity and Diversity: What Is an Archivist?" ''Archival Outlook'', March/April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Determining what records have enduring value can be challenging. Archivists must also select records valuable enough to justify the costs of storage and preservation, plus the labor-intensive expenses of arrangement, description, and reference service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Developing and Maintaining Practical Archives: A How-to-do-it Manual|last=Hunter|first=Gregory|publisher=Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc.|others=|year=2003|isbn=|editor=|location=New York|pages=|chapter=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory and scholarly work underpinning [[archive]]s practices is called [[archival science]].

The most common related occupations are [[librarian]]s, [[Curator|museum curators]], and [[records manager]]s. The archivist occupation is distinct from that of librarian. The two occupations have separate courses of training, adhere to separate and distinct principles, and are represented by separate [[Professional association|professional organization]]s. In general, the librarian tends to deal with published media (where the [[metadata]], such as author, title, and date of publication, may be readily apparent and can be presented in standardized form), whereas the archivist deals with unpublished media (which has different challenges such as the metadata not always being immediately apparent, containing complications and variety, and more likely to depend on [[provenance]]).

In addition, because archival records are frequently unique, some archivists may be as much concerned with the preservation and custody of the information carrier (i.e. the physical document) as with its informational content. In this regard, some would argue the archivist may have more in common with the [[Curator|museum curator]] than with the librarian.

The occupation of archivist is also frequently distinguished from that of [[records manager]], although in this case the distinction is less absolute: the archivist is predominantly concerned with records deemed worthy of permanent preservation, whereas the records manager is more concerned with records of current administrative importance.

==Duties and work environment==
Archivists' duties include acquiring and [[archival appraisal|appraising]] new collections, [[manuscript processing|arranging and describing records]], providing reference service, and preserving materials.  In arranging records, archivists apply two important principles: [[provenance]] and [[original order]].  Provenance refers to the creation of records and keeping different records separate in order to maintain context. Many entities create records, including governments, businesses, universities, and individuals. Original order is applied by keeping records in their order as established and maintained by the creator(s). Both provenance and original order are closely related to the concept of ''[[respect des fonds]]'', which states that records from one corporate body should not be mixed with records from another.

There are two aspects to arrangement: intellectual and physical. Both aspects follow the principle of original order. Archivists process the records physically by placing them in acid-free folders and boxes to ensure their long-term survival. They also process the records intellectually, by determining what the records consist of, how they are organized, and what, if any, [[finding aid]]s need to be created. Finding aids can be box lists or descriptive inventories, or indexes. Even if the original arrangement is unclear or unhelpful in terms of accessing the collection, it is rarely rearranged to something that makes more sense. This is because preserving the original order shows how the creator of the records functioned, why the records were created, and how they went about arranging them. Moreover, the provenance and authenticity of the records may be lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roe|first=Kathleen D.|title=Arranging and Describing Archives and Manuscripts|year=2005|publisher=Society of American Archivists|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, original order is not always the best way to maintain some collections and archivists must use their own experience and current best practices to determine the correct way to preserve collections of mixed media or those lacking a clear original arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://saa.archivists.org/store/understanding-archives-and-manuscripts-afs-ii/339/|title=Understanding Archives and Manuscripts|last=O'Toole|first=James M. and Richard J. Cox|publisher=Society of American Archivists|others=|year=2006|isbn=|editor=|location=Chicago|pages=|chapter=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archivists' work encompasses a range of [[Ethics|ethical]] decisions that may be thought of as falling into three broad and intertwined areas: legal requirements; professional standards; and accountability to society in selecting and preserving documentary materials that serve as a [[Primary sources|primary source]] of knowledge, and influence [[collective memory]] and identity.&lt;ref&gt;Danielson, Elena S. (2010). ''The Ethical Archivist''. Chicago: The Society of American Archivists. p. 22-26, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In negotiating the ethical conflicts that arise in their work, archivists are guided by [[Ethical code|codes of ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Danielson (2010), chapter 1, "Codes of Ethics," p. 21-46.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society of American Archivists first adopted a [https://www2.archivists.org/groups/committee-on-ethics-and-professional-conduct/code-of-ethics-history code of ethics] in 1980;&lt;ref name="Horn"&gt;Horn, David E (1989). "[http://americanarchivist.org/doi/abs/10.17723/aarc.52.1.nk661527341j0610 The Development of Ethics in Archival Practice]." ''The American Archivist'', 2(1), p. 64-71. It was based on an earlier statement produced in training programs at the National Archives, under Archivist of the United States [[Wayne C. Grover]], and published as "[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015071393535;view=image;page=root;size=100;seq=713;num=307 The Archivist's Code]" (''American Archivist'', vol. 18, no. 4, p. 307-308).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Council on Archives]] adopted one in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ica.org/?lid=5555&amp;bid=225 ICA Code of Ethics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929074919/http://www.ica.org/?lid=5555&amp;bid=225 |date=29 September 2015 }}." International Council on Archives. Retrieved 2015-09-01. The ICA code is available in 23 languages.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside their work in arranging and caring for collections, archivists assist users in interpreting materials and answering inquiries. This reference work can be a small part of an archivist's job in a smaller organization, or consist of most of their occupation in a larger archive where specific roles (such as [[Manuscript processing|processing archivist]] and [[Reference interview|reference archivist]]) may be delineated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Donnell|first=Frances|date=|year=2000|title=Reference Service in an Academic Archives|url=https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/science/article/pii/S0099133399001470|journal=The [[Journal of Academic Librarianship]]|volume=26|issue=2|pages=110–118|doi=10.1016/S0099-1333(99)00147-0|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archivists work for a variety of organizations, including [[government agency|government agencies]], [[local authorities]], museums, hospitals, historical societies, businesses, charities, corporations, [[colleges]] and universities, and any institution whose records may potentially be valuable to researchers, exhibitors, [[genealogist]]s, or others. They can also work on the collections of a large family or even of an [[individual]].

Archivists are often educators as well; it is not unusual for an archivist employed at a university or college to lecture in a subject related to their collection. Archivists employed at cultural institutions or for local government frequently design educational or [[outreach]] programs to further the ability of archive users to understand and access information in their collections. This might include such varied activities as [[Art exhibitions|exhibitions]], [[Advertising campaign|promotional]] events, or even media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archivists.org/governance/guidelines/cu_guidelines4.asp|title=Guidelines for College and University Archives, Section IV. Core Archival Functions, Subsection D. Service |accessdate=23 April 2007 |publisher=Society of American Archivists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of [[Encoded Archival Description]], along with increasing demand for materials to be made available online, has required archivists to become more tech-savvy in the past decade.  Many archivists are now acquiring basic [[XML]] skills in order to make their finding aids available to researchers online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/arch/ead.shtml|title=Encoded Archival Description |accessdate=23 April 2007 |publisher=Archives Hub| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070404125702/http://archiveshub.ac.uk/arch/ead.shtml| archivedate= 4 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skills==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Between_the_Forks_Exhibit.JPG|right|thumb|An Archivist and volunteer worker with an exhibit on local history.  Project management, preservation of historic materials, and research skills are just a few of the abilities required in an archivist's background to make such public education efforts effective and exciting. {{speedy-image-c|22 April 2007}}]] --&gt;

Because of the varied nature of the job within different organizations and work environments, archivists need to have a wide range of [[skills]]:
* Those who work in reference and access-oriented positions should have good customer services skills, to help patrons with their research.
* A basic knowledge of [[Preservation: Library and Archival Science|conservation]] is needed to help extend the life of cultural artifacts. Many types of media (such as photographs, acidic papers, and unstable copy processes) can deteriorate if not stored and maintained properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Mary Lynn | last=Ritzenthaler | year=1993 | title=Preserving Archives and Manuscripts | chapter= | editor= | others= | location=Chicago | publisher=Society of American Archivists | id= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although many archival collections consist solely of paper records, increasingly archivists must confront the new challenges posed by the [[digital preservation|preservation]] of electronic records, so they need to be forward-looking and technologically proficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub89/archival.html|title=The Archival Paradigm—The Genesis and Rationales of Archival Principles and Practices|accessdate=3 April 2007 |publisher=Council on Library and Information Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational preparation==
The educational preparation for archivists varies from country to country.

===Australia===
The [[Australian Society of Archivists]] is the professional body for archivists, and is responsible for the accreditation of the various University courses.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archivists.org.au/learning-publications/accredited-courses|title=Accredited courses|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first University to offer archival training was the [[University of New South Wales]], starting in 1973. The course closed in 2000.

Courses are now offered at [[Curtin University]] in [[Western Australia]], [[Charles Sturt University]] in [[New South Wales]], [[Monash University]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[University of South Australia]] at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The course at [[Edith Cowan University]] is being phased out.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Courses are offered in a variety of modes, including online via [[Open University Australia]] and through a combination of online and internal units at the various universities.

===Brazil===
The profession has been regulated since 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/1970-1979/L6546.htm|title=L6546|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities in Brazil, such as the University of Brasilian (UnB), the [[Federal University of Santa Catarina]] (UFSC), the [[Federal University of Santa Maria]] (UFSM) and the [[São Paulo State University]] (UNESP) offer the degree in [[archival science]].

===Colombia===
In [[Colombia]], the [[Universidad de La Salle]] offers the degree of Professional in Information Systems, Library and Archival Sciences. It is a vocational training program, within existing legal standards aimed at providing knowledge, skills and abilities required for the design and management of information systems and documentation of various sorts. Its projection for the future is based on the application of new information technologies and communications for the management of information services economically viable. The program was created in 1971.

Other institutions that offers a degree in Archival Science are:
* [[Universidad del Quindío]] – Professional degree: Professional in Information and Documentation, Library and Archival Sciences.
* [[Universidad de Antioquia, Escuela Interamericana de Bibliotecología]] – Technological degree: Technologist in Archival Science.
* [[Universidad Católica de Manizales]] – Technological degree: Technologist in Documentation and Archival Science.
* [[Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje]] – SENA – in chain training with the [[Antioquia Institute of Technology|Tecnológico de Antioquia]] Tecnológico de Antioquia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plataforma.unipamplona.edu.co/tda|title=Wayback Machine|website=web.archive.org|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820042453/http://plataforma.unipamplona.edu.co/tda|archivedate=20 August 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Technical degree: Professional Technical in Archives, Technological degree: Technologist in Documentation and Archival Science.

===France===
In France, the oldest Archivist School is the ''[[École des chartes]]'', founded in 1821. This prestigious ''[[grande école]]'' (literally, "grand schools) offers a diploma in "Archivist-Paleography" after a three-year curriculum. A part of its alumni pursue a State archivist career after an 18-month formation at the ''[[Institut national du patrimoine]]''. Most positions are reserved for European citizens.

Some universities offer master's degree in Archival Science: [[University of Angers|Angers]], [[University of Caen|Caen]], [[University of Dijon|Dijon]], [[Charles de Gaulle University - Lille III|Lille III]], [[Jean Moulin University Lyon 3|Lyon III]], [[Upper Alsace University|Mulhouse]], [[Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines University|Versailles Saint-Quentin]],

===Republic of Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland, the [[University College Dublin School of History and Archives]] offers a Masters of Arts degree in Archives and Records Management, recognised by the Society of Archivists.

===New Zealand===
[[Victoria University of Wellington]] is the only tertiary institution in [[New Zealand]] provides postgraduate archival courses. Victoria Information Studies qualifications with ARCR endorsement have been recognized by [[Records and Information Management Professionals Australasia]]. Open Polytechnic of New Zealand provides undergraduate archival courses.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, there are currently five full- or part-time postgraduate courses in archives administration or management which are recognised by the [[Archives and Records Association]] (United Kingdom and Ireland). Students are expected to have relevant paid or voluntary [[work experience]] before obtaining a place on the UK courses; many undertake a year's traineeship. Also, professional certification (after qualifying) can be pursued via the Registration Scheme offered by the Archives and Records Association.

===United States===
The most common types of advanced degrees held by archivists are in [[archival science]], [[public history]], history, [[library science]], or [[library and information science]]. It is also possible for archivists to earn a doctorate in library and information science. Archivists with a PhD often work as teaching faculty, deans, or directors of archival programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yakel and Bastian |first=Elizabeth and Jeannette |date=Fall–Winter 2007 |title=A*Census: Report on Archival Graduate Education |journal=American Archivist |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=349–366 |url=http://www.archivists.org/a-census/reports/YakelBastian-ACENSUS.pdf| accessdate=4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the [[Society of American Archivists]] published Guidelines for a Graduate Program in Archival Studies;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archivists.org/prof-education/ed_guidelines.asp#_ftn1 |title=Guidelines for a Graduate Program in Archival Studies |accessdate=30 March 2007 |publisher=Society of American Archivists| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070406075051/http://www.archivists.org/prof-education/ed_guidelines.asp| archivedate= 6 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also promotes and disseminates a code of ethics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=SAA Core Values Statement and Code of Ethics |accessdate=2015-09-01|publisher=Society of American Archivists|url=http://www2.archivists.org/statements/saa-core-values-statement-and-code-of-ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has undergone several revisions since it was first adopted in 1980.&lt;ref name=Horn/&gt;

The [[Academy of Certified Archivists]] offers supplemental archival training by means of a certification program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academy of Certified Archivists|url=http://www.certifiedarchivists.org/|accessdate=31 March 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110317200502/http://www.certifiedarchivists.org/| archivedate= 17 March 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; When first established in 1989, some critics of ACA certification objected to its annual membership fees, the theoretical versus practical nature of its tests, and the need for members to re-certify every five years. However, in the decades since, it has been agreed that such requirements are comparable with certification programs in other professions, and that certification strengthens professional standards and individual competencies. While some positions in archives require certification and many employers view certification as preferred, it is not required by all employers in the United States. Approximately 1,200+ archivists were certified by ACA, {{as of|2016|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.certifiedarchivists.org/about-us/presidents-address-2/|title=2016 President’s Address {{!}} Welcome to the Academy of Certified Archivists|last=Jones|first=Louis|date=|website=www.certifiedarchivists.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional organizations and continuing education==
Many archivists belong to a professional organization, such as the [[Society of American Archivists]], the [[Association of Canadian Archivists]], the [[Archives and Records Association]] (UK/Ireland), the [[Colombian College of Archivists - CCA]], and the [[Australian Society of Archivists]], as well as any number of local or regional associations.  These organizations often provide ongoing educational opportunities to their members and other interested practitioners.   In addition to formal degrees and or apprenticeships, many archivists take part in continuing education opportunities as available through professional associations and library school programs. New discoveries in the fields of [[media preservation]] and emerging technologies require continuing education as part of an archivist's job in order to stay current in the profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmelman |first=Nancy |date=Fall–Winter 2007 |title=A*Census: Report on Continuing Education |journal=American Archivist |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=367–395 |url=http://www.archivists.org/a-census/reports/Zimmelman-ACENSUS.pdf| accessdate=4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the profession==
The first predecessors of archival science in the West are Jacob von Rammingen's manuals of 1571.&lt;ref&gt;The earliest predecessors of archival science - Jacob von Rammingen's two manuals of registry and archival management, printed in 1571, translated by JBLD Strömberg. Lund: Wallin &amp; Dalholm, Lundaboken, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and Baldassare Bonifacio's ''De Archivis libris singularis'' of 1632.&lt;ref&gt;L. Sandri, 'Il "De Archivis" di Baldassare Bonifacio', ''Notizie delle Archive di Stato'', Roma, 1950, p. 95-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883 French archivist Gabriel Richou published the first Western text on archival theory, entitled ''Traité théorique et pratique des archives publiques'' (''Treaty of Theory and Practice of the Public Archives''), in which he systematized the archival theory of the ''[[respect des fonds]]'', first published by [[Natalis de Wailly]] in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;F. Hildesheimer, "Les Premières publications des Archives", ''Histoires de France, historiens de la France'', Paris, 1994, p. 280-299.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, three Dutch archivists, Samuel Muller, Johan Feith, and Robert Fruin, published the ''Handleiding voor het ordenen en beschrijven van archieven'' (''Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives''). Produced for the Dutch Association of Archivists, it set out one hundred rules for archivists to base their work around. Notably, within these rules, the principle of preserving [[provenance]] and original order was first argued for as an essential trait of archival arrangement and description.&lt;ref name=Cook1997&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major text was the ''Manual of Archive Administration'' published in 1922 by [[Hilary Jenkinson]], then employed at the British [[Public Record Office]]: a revised edition appeared in 1937. In this work, Jenkinson states that archives are evidence and that the moral and physical defence of this evidential value is the central tenet of archival work. He further outlines his ideas of what an archive should be and how it should operate.

In 1956, [[T. R. Schellenberg]], who is known as the "Father of American Archival Appraisal",&lt;ref name=Cook1997/&gt; published ''Modern Archives''. Schellenberg's work was intended to be an academic textbook defining archival methodology and giving archivists specific technical instruction on workflow and arrangement. Moving away from Jenkinson's organic and passive approach to archival acquisition, where the administrator decided what was kept and what was destroyed, Schellenberg argued for a more active approach by archivists to appraisal. His primary (administrative) and secondary (research) value model for the management and appraisal of records and archives allowed government archivists greater control over the influx of material that they faced after the Second World War. As a result of the widespread adoption of Schellenberg's methods, especially in the United States of America, modern [[Records Management]] as a separate but related discipline was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Theodore R. | last=Schellenberg | year=1956 | title=Modern Archives: Principles and Techniques | chapter= | editor= | others= | location=Chicago | publisher=University of Chicago Press | id= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, [[Ernst Posner]] published ''Archives in the Ancient World''.  Posner's work emphasized that archives were not new inventions, but had existed in many different societies throughout recorded history.

In 1975, essays by [[Margaret C. Norton|Margaret Cross Norton]] were collected under the title of ''Norton on Archives: The Writings of Margaret Cross Norton on Archival and Records Management''. Norton was one of the founders of the [[Society of American Archivists]], and wrote essays based on her decades of experience working in the [[Illinois]] State Archives.

==Archives 2.0==

Archivists, like librarians, are taking advantage of [[Web 2.0]] technologies such as blogs, [[wiki]]s, as well as [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] and [[open source]] philosophies. While Archives 2.0 may refer to implementing new technologies, it is also a way of engaging with archives in an effort to promote openness and flexibility of archival materials. This can be achieved through community participation in archives, archivists actively engaging with their collections, and promoting archival benefits in the modern world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Theimer|first=Kate|date=2011|title=What is the Meaning of Archives 2.0?|url=http://americanarchivist.org/doi/10.17723/aarc.74.1.h7tn4m4027407666|journal=The American Archivist|volume=74|pages=58–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kate Theimer writes that in order to understand Archives 2.0, it must be compared against Archives 1.0. She asserts that her representation of Archives 1.0 is by no means exhaustive or fully comprehensive of the breadth of archival experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The following is a list of contrasts between 1.0 and 2.0.

* "Open, not closed;
* Transparent, not opaque;
* User centered, not record centered;
* Facilitator, not gatekeeper;
* Attracting new users, not relying on users to find them;
* Shared standards, not localized practice;
* Metrics and measurement, not 'unmeasurable' results;
* Iterative products, not 'perfect' products;
* Innovation and flexibility, not adhering to tradition;
* Technology savvy, not technology phobic;
* Value doing, not knowing;
* Confident about lobbying for resources, not hesitant beggars."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The technological tools of Archives 2.0 provide the foundational platforms to help the change from 1.0 to 2.0. When working in an archives that is dedicated to upholding 2.0 standards, the focus has shifted onto the user experience at an archives:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; community use, or research and reference help.

The '''art world''' comprises everyone involved in producing, commissioning, presenting, [[Historic preservation|preserving]], promoting, chronicling, [[Art criticism|criticizing]], and selling [[fine art]].  

==Descriptions==
''Art world'' is indeed a wider term than [[art market]], though that is a large part of it.  [[Howard S. Becker]] describes it as "the network of people whose cooperative activity, organized via their joint knowledge of conventional means of doing things, produce(s) the kind of art works that art world is noted for" (Becker, 1982). In her book, ''Seven Days in the Art World'', Sarah Thornton describes it as "a loose network of overlapping subcultures held together by a belief in art. They span the globe but [[Art cluster|cluster]] in art capitals like New York, London, Los Angeles, and Berlin."&lt;ref name="Thornton"&gt;Thornton 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Other cities sometimes called "art capitals" include Beijing, Brussels, Hong Kong, Miami, Paris, Rome and Tokyo; due to their large art festivals, followings, and being the centers of art production.{{citation needed (lead)|date=August 2016}}

The notion of the singular ''art world'' is problematic, since Becker &lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;[[Howard S. Becker|Becker, Howard S.]] ''Art Worlds''. [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]: [[University of California]] Press, 1982. {{ISBN|0-520-05218-8}}. Cited in Sanjeck (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; and others show art worlds are, instead, independent multiplicities scattered worldwide that are always in flux: there is no "center" to the art world any more. In her analysis of the "net art world" (referring to network-aided art or [[net art]]), Amy Alexander states "net.art had a movement, at the very least it had coherence, and although it aimed to subvert the art world, eventually its own sort of art world formed around it. It developed a culture, hype and mystique through lists and texts; it had a centre, insiders, outsiders, even nodes.  This is of course not a failure; this is unavoidable: groups form; even anarchism is an institution." &lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;Alexander, Amy. ''net art history'' (2001) [http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0102/msg00223.html Nettime.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
Art worlds exist at local and regional levels, as hidden or obscured subcultures, via primary and secondary art markets, through gallery circuits, around design movements, and, esoterically, as shared or perceived experiences. 

The one globalized, all-encompassing art world exists only as myth; rather, there are multiplicities of intersecting, overlapping, self-similar art worlds, each expressing different views of the world as they see it.

''[[Whitehot Magazine]]'' artist/publisher [[Noah Becker]] has published over 3500 articles about the Art World."&lt;ref&gt; Becker, Noah. [http://Whitehotmagazine.com His art magazine called Whitehot Magazine has taken the top spot as one of the only art magazines left in the world. &lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New York Magazine]]'' art critic [[Jerry Saltz]] has referred to [[William Powhida]]'s and Jade Townsend's drawing ''Art Basel Miami Beach Hooverville'' as "a great big art-world stinkbomb."&lt;ref&gt;Saltz, Jerry. [http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/03/saltz_william_powhida_is_makin.html "William Powhida Is Making Fun of Me, And I Love It"]. ''New York Magazine''. 9 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--  This is misleading nonsense as written
==Theory==
The term "art world" is  a product of the Institutional [[theory of art]]. It originates with the [[theorн of American art|theories of American art]] critic and [[philosopher]] [[Arthur Danto]]. In 1964 Danto published an essay "The Artworld," in which the term "artworld" was coined, meaning cultural context or "an atmosphere of art theory".&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/art-definition/&lt;/ref&gt; It has had considerable influence on aesthetic philosophy and, according to professor of philosophy Stephen David Ross, "especially upon [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]]'s institutional theory of art." Dickie defines an art work as an artefact "which has had conferred upon it the status of candidate for appreciation by some person or persons acting in behalf of a certain social institution (the artworld)" (p. 43.)&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=vDdZNwTmEqUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=danto&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The central core of Danto’s "The Artworld" is "artistic theory", which elevates things to the world of art (or art world). 

Danto writes: "these days one might not be aware he was on artistic terrain without an artistic theory to tell him so. And part of the reason for this lies in the fact that terrain is constituted artistic in virtue of artistic theories, so that one use of theories, in addition to helping us discriminate art from the rest, consists in making art possible" (Danto, The Artworld, p. 3).--&gt;

'''Baited remote underwater video''' (BRUV) is a system used in [[marine biology]] research. By attracting fish into the field of view of a remotely controlled camera, the technique records [[fish diversity]], [[Abundance (ecology)|abundance]] and [[Ethology|behaviour]] of species. Sites are sampled by video recording the region surrounding a baited canister which is lowered to the bottom from a surface vessel or less commonly by a [[submersible]] or [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]]. The video can be transmitted directly to the surface by cable, or recorded for later analysis.

Baited cameras are highly effective at attracting [[scavenger]]s and subsequent [[Predation|predators]],&lt;ref&gt;Wilson RR Jr, Smith KL Jr (1984) Effect of near-bottom currents on detection of bait by the abyssal grenadier fishes Coryphaenoides spp., recorded in situ with a video camera on a free vehicle.

As a non-extractive technique, it offers a low environmental impact way of understanding changes in fish numbers and diversity over time. BRUV surveys were developed in Australia, and are now used around the world for a variety of projects. This is a low budget monitoring system that is less reliant on the availability of skilled labour and may make sustainable monitoring more practical, over the long term.&lt;ref&gt;''Baited remote underwater video (BRUV) survey of False Bay’s icthyofauna'' http://www.saeon.ac.za/enewsletter/archives/2013/february2013/doc01 accessed 3 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main types of remote video technique which have been used to record [[reef fish]] populations. They can both be left free standing without the need of an operator. The first system uses one downward looking camera (D-BRUV), and the other uses either one (mono) or two (stereo) horizontally facing cameras (H-BRUV),&lt;ref&gt;Tim Langlois, Pascale Chabanet, Dominique Pelletier, Euan Harvey (2006) ''Baited underwater video for assessing reef fish populations in marine reserves'', SPC Fisheries Newsletter #118 – July/September 2006, 53&lt;/ref&gt; and may use underwater lighting to illuminate the target area. Stereo BRUV recordings can use software analysis to determine the size of specimens.

The colour of the lighting used for video may influence behaviour of the target species.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, Erika H. &amp; Widder, Edith A.''Behavioral responses of two deep-sea fish species to red, far-red, and white light.''

The '''blue–white screen''' is a [[Genetic screen|screening technique]] that allows for the rapid and convenient detection of recombinant bacteria in [[Vector DNA|vector]]-based [[molecular cloning]] experiments.  [[DNA]] of interest is ligated into a [[Vector DNA|vector]].  The vector is then [[Transformation (etics)|inserted]] into a [[competent cell|competent host cell]] viable for transformation, which are then grown in the presence of [[X-gal]]. Cells transformed with vectors containing [[recombinant DNA]] will produce white colonies; cells transformed with non-recombinant plasmids (i.e. only the vector) grow into blue colonies. This method of screening is usually performed using a suitable [[bacteria|bacterial strain]], but other organisms such as yeast may also be used.

==Background==
[[Molecular cloning]] is one of the most commonly used procedures in [[molecular biology]].  A gene of interest may be inserted into a plasmid vector via [[DNA ligase|ligation]], and the plasmid is then transformed into ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' cells.  However, not all the plasmids transformed into cells may contain the desired gene insert, and checking each individual colony for the presence of the insert is time-consuming, therefore a method for the detection of the insert would be useful for making this procedure less time- and labor-intensive.  One of the early methods developed for the detection of insert is blue-white screening which allows for identification of successful products of cloning reactions through the colour of the [[bacterial]] colony.

The method is based on the principle of α-complementation of the [[Beta-galactosidase|β-galactosidase]] gene.  This phenomenon of α-complementation was first demonstrated in work done by [[Agnes Ullmann]] in the laboratory of [[François Jacob]] and [[Jacques Monod]], where the function of an inactive mutant β-galactosidase with deleted sequence was shown to be rescued by a fragment of β-galactosidase in which that same sequence, the α-donor peptide, is still intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this method, DNA ligated into the plasmid disrupts the α peptide and therefore the complementation process, and no functional β-galactosidase can form.  Cells transformed with plasmid containing an insert therefore form white colonies, while cells transformed with plasmid without an insert form blue colonies; result of a successful ligation can thus be easily identified by the white coloration of cells formed from the unsuccessful blue ones.&lt;ref name=sambrook&gt;{{cite book |title=Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual |author=Joseph Sambrook, David Russell |volume=1 |edition=3rd |chapter=Chapter 1 |page=1.27 |isbn=978-0-87969-577-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecular mechanism==
[[Image:Blue white assay Ecoli.jpg|thumb|250px| A schematic representation of the Blue-white assay, used to screen for recombinant vectors]]
[[Beta-galactosidase|β-galactosidase]] is a protein encoded by the ''lacZ'' gene of the [[Lac operon|''lac'' operon]], and it exists as a [[homotetramer]] in its active state.  However, a mutant β-galactosidase derived from the M15 strain of ''E. coli'' has its N-terminal residues 11—41 deleted and this mutant, the ω-peptide, is unable to form a tetramer and is inactive.  This mutant form of protein however may return fully to its active tetrameric state in the presence of an N-terminal fragment of the protein, the α-peptide.  The rescue of function of the mutant β-galactosidase by the α-peptide is called α-complementation.

In this method of screening, the host ''E. coli'' strain carries the ''lacZ'' deletion mutant (''lacZΔM15'') which contains the ω-peptide, while the plasmids used carry the ''lacZα'' sequence which encodes the first 59 residues of β-galactosidase, the α-peptide.  Neither is functional by itself.  However, when the two peptides are expressed together, as when a plasmid containing the ''lacZα'' sequence is transformed into a ''lacZΔM15'' cells, they form a functional [[β-galactosidase]] enzyme.
 
The blue/white screening method works by disrupting this α-complementation process.  The plasmid carries within the ''lacZα'' sequence an internal [[multiple cloning site]] (MCS).  This MCS within the ''lacZα'' sequence can be cut by restriction enzymes so that the foreign DNA may be inserted within the ''lacZ''α gene, thereby disrupting the gene that produces α-peptide.  Consequently, in cells containing the plasmid with an insert, no functional [[β-galactosidase]] may be formed.

The presence of an active β-galactosidase can be detected by [[X-gal]], a colourless [[Structural analog|analog]] of lactose that may be cleaved by β-galactosidase to form 5-bromo-4-chloro-indoxyl, which then spontaneously dimerizes and oxidizes to form a bright blue insoluble pigment 5,5'-dibromo-4,4'-dichloro-indigo.  This results in a characteristic blue colour in cells containing a functional β-galactosidase.  Blue colonies therefore show that they may contain a vector with an uninterrupted ''lacZα'' (therefore no insert), while white colonies, where X-gal is not hydrolyzed, indicate the presence of an insert in ''lacZα'' which disrupts the formation of an active β-galactosidase.

The recombinant clones can be further analyzed by isolating and purifying small amounts of plasmid DNA from the transformed colonies and restriction enzymes can be used to cut the clone and determine if it has the fragment of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38325074|title=Fundamental laboratory approaches for biochemistry and biotechnology|last=J.|first=Ninfa, Alexander|date=1998|publisher=Fitzgerald Science Press|others=Ballou, David P.|year=|isbn=1891786008|location=Bethesda, Md.|pages=355–356|oclc=38325074}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the DNA is necessary to be sequenced, the plasmids from the colonies will need to be isolated at a point, whether to cut using restriction enzymes or performing other assays.

==Practical considerations==
The correct type of [[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]] and [[competent cell]]s are important considerations when planning a blue white screen.  The plasmid must contain the ''lacZ''α, and examples of such plasmids are [[pUC19]] and [[pBluescript]].  The ''E. coli'' cell should contain the mutant ''lacZ'' gene with deleted sequence (i.e. ''lacZΔM15''), and some of the commonly used cells with such genotype are JM109, DH5α, and XL1-Blue.

It should also be understood that the lac operon is affected by the presence of glucose.  The protein [[PEP group translocation|EIIA&lt;sup&gt;Glc&lt;/sup&gt;]], which is involved in glucose import, shuts down lactose permease when glucose is being transported into the cell.  The media used in agar plate therefore should not include glucose.

X-gal is light-sensitive and therefore its solution and plates containing X-gal should be stored in the dark.  [[Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside]] (IPTG), which functions as the inducer of the ''lac'' operon, may be used in the media to enhance the expression of LacZ.

[[X-gal]] is an expensive material, thus other methods have been developed in order to screen bacteria. [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]] has been developed as an alternative to help screen bacteria. The concept is similar to α-complementation in which a DNA insert can disrupt the coding sequence within a vector and thus disrupt the GFP production resulting in non-fluorescing bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Speltz|first=Elizabeth B.|last2=Regan|first2=Lynne|date=June 2013|title=White and green screening with circular polymerase extension cloning for easy and reliable cloning|journal=Protein Science|language=en|volume=22|issue=6|pages=859–864|doi=10.1002/pro.2268|pmc=3690724|pmid=23592493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacteria that have recombinant vectors (vector + insert), will be white and not express the GFP protein, while non-recombinant (vector), will and fluoresce under UV light.

GFP in general has been used as a reporter gene where individuals can definitively determine if a clone carries a gene that researchers are analyzing. On occasion, the medium in which the colonies grow can influence the screen and introduce false-positive results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banerjee|first=Sampali|last2=Kumar|first2=Jitendra|last3=Apte-Deshpande|first3=Anjali|last4=Padmanabhan|first4=Sriram|date=2010-05-11|title=A novel prokaryotic vector for identification and selection of recombinants: Direct use of the vector for expression studies in E. coli|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2859-9-30|journal=Microbial Cell Factories|volume=9|pages=30|doi=10.1186/1475-2859-9-30|issn=1475-2859}}&lt;/ref&gt; X-gal on the medium can occasionally degrade to produce a blue color or GFP can lose its fluorescence because of the medium and can impact researchers capabilities to determine colonies with the desire recombinant and those that do not possess it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banerjee|first=Sampali|last2=Kumar|first2=Jitendra|last3=Apte-Deshpande|first3=Anjali|last4=Padmanabhan|first4=Sriram|date=2010-05-11|title=A novel prokaryotic vector for identification and selection of recombinants: Direct use of the vector for expression studies in E. coli|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2859-9-30|journal=Microbial Cell Factories|volume=9|pages=30|doi=10.1186/1475-2859-9-30|issn=1475-2859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drawbacks===
Some white colonies may not contain the desired recombinant plasmid for a number of reasons.  The ligated DNA may not be the correct one or not properly ligated, and it is possible for some linearized vector to be transformed, its ends "repaired" and ligated together such that no LacZα is produced and no blue colonies may be formed.  Mutation can also lead to the α-fragment not being expressed.  A colony with no vector at all will also appear white, and may sometimes appear as satellite colonies after the [[antibiotic]] used has been depleted. It is also possible that blue colonies may contain the insert. This occurs when the insert is "in frame" with the LacZα gene and a STOP codon is absent in the insert. This can lead to the expression of a fusion protein that has a functional LacZα if its structure is not disrupted. The correct recombinant construct can sometimes give lighter blue colonies which may complicate its identification.

== History ==

30 years ago the Bonne Bay Marine Station was a small field station of [[Memorial University]]. The original station was a 2-storey house. The top floor had a small kitchen, a living room and three small bedrooms. The main floor had two larger rooms that were converted into labs and a small bathroom that was converted into a chemical lab where radioactive work and the chemical work was performed. It had a full basement, and there was an old fish store as a second building.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.curra.ca/documents/Newsletter_Western_Shorefast-Issue_3_for_Email.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Bob Hooper first visited the Bonne Bay area then and was taken with its breathtaking beauty, amazing marine biodiversity, and potential as a prime location for teaching and research. He helped convert this outport house with a fishing store into a marine teaching and research facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bonnebay.ca/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601090408/http://www.bonnebay.ca/history.htm |archivedate=2010-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Summer teaching activities began in 1979 with a single two week program. By 2001 seven, two week academic programs were running from mid April to September. The student demand for courses, and high level of research interest, often exceeded the available space. In addition, local visitors and summer tourists were frequently "dropping in" to view the aquarium, and learn about the latest research ventures. The existing station could no longer accommodate the needs for the facility. A new teaching and research facility plan was developed.

The official opening of the new Bonne Bay Marine Station occurred September 6, 2002. Built on the site of the old station this $3.2 million facility was funded by the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency; the Gros Morne Co-operating Association; the Department of Industry, Trade and Rural Development, Government of Newfoundland and Labrador; and Memorial University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bonnebay.ca/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601090408/http://www.bonnebay.ca/history.htm |archivedate=2010-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== CURRA ==

The Community-University Research for Recovery Alliance (CURRA) is a 5-year research program centered at Bonne Bay Marine Station. This program of innovative, interdisciplinary research projects is helping communities and organizations along Newfoundland's west coast develop strategies for the recovery of fish stocks and fishery communities.

The CURRA brings together researchers from the social and natural sciences and fine arts at Memorial University in St. John's and [[Sir Wilfred Grenfell College]] in [[Corner Brook]] in working partnerships with numerous stakeholders and community organizations.

The long-term objectives of the CURRA include promoting community engagement with the Station, promoting and diversifying the research community affiliated with the Station and training researchers in collaborative, community-based research approaches.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.curra.ca/about_us.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biology]], the '''canopy''' is the aboveground portion of a [[plant community]] or [[crop]], formed by the collection of individual [[Crown (botany)|plant crowns]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, G.S., and J.M. Norman. 1990. The description and measurement of plant canopy structure. pp. 1-19 In: Russell, G., B. Marshall, and P.G. Jarvis (editors). ''Plant Canopies: Their Growth, Form and Function''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moffett, M.W. 2000. What's ''up''? A critical look at the basic terms of canopy biology. ''Biotropica'' 32:569-596.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hay, R., and R. Porter. 2006 ''Physiology of Crop Yield'' (Second edition). Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|1-4051-0859-2}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-0859-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[forest ecology]], canopy also refers to the upper layer or [[habitat]] zone, formed by mature [[Crown (botany)|tree crowns]] and including other biological organisms ([[epiphytes]], [[lianas]], [[Arboreal|arboreal animals]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Parker, G.G. 1995. Structure and microclimate of forest canopies. pp. 73-106 In: Lowman, M.D. and N.M. Nadkarni (editors). ''Forest Canopies''. Academic Press, San Diego, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the term canopy is used to refer to the extent of the outer layer of leaves of an individual [[tree]] or group of trees.{{cn|date=October 2015}} [[Shade tree]]s normally have a dense canopy that blocks light from lower growing plants.

== Canopy structure ==
[[File:Monkey Ladder Vine canopy.jpg|thumb|A [[Entada gigas|Monkey Ladder Vine]] canopy over a road]]
Canopy structure is the organization or spatial arrangement (three-dimensional geometry) of a plant canopy. [[Leaf Area Index]] (LAI), leaf area per unit ground area, is a key measure used to understand and compare plant canopies. It is also taller than the understory layer.

== Canopy layer of forests ==

Dominant and co-dominant canopy trees form the uneven canopy layer.  Canopy trees are able to [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] relatively rapidly due to abundant light, so it supports the majority of primary productivity in forests.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  The canopy layer provides protection from strong winds and storms, while also intercepting sunlight and precipitation, leading to a relatively sparsely vegetated [[understory]] layer.

Forest canopies are home to unique flora and fauna not found in other layers of forests.  The highest terrestrial [[biodiversity]] resides in the canopy of [[tropical rainforest]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lowman, M.D. and M.W. Moffett. 1993. The ecology of tropical rain forest canopies. ''Trees'' 8:104-107.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many rainforest animals have evolved to live solely in the canopy, and never touch the ground.

The canopy of a [[rainforest]] is typically about 10m thick, and intercepts around 95% of sunlight.&lt;ref name=Garden.org&gt;{{cite web|title=Light in the Rain Forest|url=http://assoc.garden.org/courseweb/course1/week4/page5a.htm|website=garden.org|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The canopy is below the [[Rainforest#Layers|emergent layer]], a sparse layer of very tall trees, typically one or two per [[hectare]].  With an abundance of water and a near ideal temperature in rainforests, light and nutrients are two factors that limit tree growth from the understory to the canopy.

In the [[permaculture]] and [[forest gardening]] community, the canopy is the highest of seven layers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14275">'''Community-driven development''' (CDD) is a [[development initiative]]{{what|date=September 2016}} that provides control of the [[economic development|development process]], resources and [[decision making]] authority directly to groups in the community. The underlying assumption of CDD projects are that communities are the best judges of how their lives and livelihoods can be improved and, if provided with adequate resources and information, they can organize themselves to provide for their immediate needs. CDD projects work by providing poor communities with direct funding for development with the communities then deciding how to spend the money. Lastly, the community plans and builds the project and takes responsibility for monitoring its progress.

== Characteristics of CDD ==
CDD programmes are motivated by their trust in people (Naidoo and Finn, 2001) and hence it advocates people changing their own [[Social environment|environment]] as a powerful force for development.

By treating poor people as assets and partners in the development process, studies have shown that CDD is responsive to local demands, inclusive, and more cost-effective compared to centrally-led [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]-based programmes. CDD can also be supported by strengthening and financing [[community group]]s, facilitating community access to information, and promoting an enabling environment through policy and [[institutional reform]] (Dongier, 2002).

Following from this description, field practitioners at the [[World Bank]] have denoted five key characteristics of CDD projects.
# A CDD operation primarily targets a [[community-based organization]] or a representative local council of a community. This community focus means that the essential defining characteristic of a CDD project is that the beneficiaries or grantees of implementations are agents of the community. Since the focus on small communities is so large the CDD normally targets small scale [[subproject]]s in the community.
# In CDD operations, community- or locally based representation is responsible for designing and planning the subprojects in a participatory manner. Since the concentration on participatory planning is considerable in CDD operations, often the possible types of subproject [[investment]] options are very large with only a small list of subprojects that cannot be carried out.
# The defining characteristic of CDD projects is that a transfer of resources to the community occurs and control of the resources is delegated to the community. The amount of transfer and control of resources will depend on the CDD implementations.
# The community is directly involved in the implementation of the subproject. Often the participation of the community comes directly in the form of labour or funds. However, the community may also contribute to the subproject indirectly in the form of management and supervision of contractors or the operation and maintenance of the [[infrastructure]] when complete.
# An element of community-based [[monitoring and evaluation]] has become a characteristic of CDD subprojects. Most often it is [[social accountability]] tools such as [[participatory monitoring]], community scorecards and [[grievance redress]] systems which allow for the community to ensure accountability of the CDD implementation.

== CDD vs. CBD ==
Community-driven development is derived from [[community-based development]] (CBD) which can include a much broader range of projects. For example, CBD projects can include everything from simple [[information sharing]] to social, economic and political empowerment of community groups. However, CDD projects fit on the [[empowerment]] end of CBD by actively engaging beneficiaries in the design, management and implementation of projects. The stress on actual control of decision-making and project resources at nearly all stages of a subproject cycle distinguishes CDD from the previous generation of CBD projects. In this continuum of [[community participation]] covered by CBD, new-generation CDD projects are located at the extreme right (Tanaka, 2006).

Since community-driven development has only recently diverged from the broad community-based development there are a few contrasts visible in the five characteristics of CDD programmes. In essence, all five properties of CDD projects exist together only in the newer generation of CDD implementations. Nevertheless, the first attribute of community focus would apply to all CDD projects and CBD projects. In contrast, the second characteristic of [[participatory planning]] and design and the fourth property of community involvement are often visible among all CDD projects but very rarely in CBD projects. Moreover, community-based monitoring and evaluation which is the fifth aspect of CDD projects is only found in some of the newer projects. The fifth characteristic is what positions many of the newer CDD projects in the extreme right of the CDD cluster as diagrammatically demonstrated in Figure 1. As mentioned above, the third characteristic of community control of resources seems to be the key factor to conceptually distinguish between CDD and CBD projects. However, many of the early NGOs implementing CDD projects did not always interpret this factor rigorously (Tanaka, 2006). Thus, the distinction between CDD projects and CBD projects with CDD components was not always clear; however, this would be expected since there was a gradual evolution of CDD out of CBD.

To alleviate the earlier problems of over-reliance on [[central government]]s as the main [[service provider]], CDD programs were launched by the World Bank to improve the accountability and services in key areas. However, NGOs quickly learned that well designed and implemented CDD programmes had ripple effects of promoting equity and inclusiveness, [[efficiency]] and good governance. By effectively targeting and including the vulnerable and excluded groups, as well as allowing communities to manage and control resources directly it was evident that CDD programs could allow poverty reduction projects to scale up quickly. Efficiency is gained through demand responsive allocation of resources, reduced corruption and misuse of resources, lower costs and better [[cost recovery]], better quality and maintenance, greater utilization of resources, and the community‘s willingness to pay for goods and services. Good governance is promoted by greater transparency, accountability in allocation and use of resources because the community participates in project decision-making processes. Some of the principles of CDD—such as participation, empowerment, accountability, and [[nondiscrimination]]—are also worthy ends in themselves ([[Asian Development Bank]], 2008).

It was as early as 1881 when [[T.H. Green]] who wrote about the maximum power for all members of [[human society]] alike to make the best of themselves (Zakaria, 1999). However, it was not until the 1970s with [[John Rawls]]’ book ―[[A Theory of Justice]] and in the 1990s with [[Amartya Sen]]‘s book ―[[Development as Freedom]] where the notions of [[substantive freedom]] and the multidimensional nature of [[poverty]] were made explicit to the [[multilateral development bank]]s. This recognition of the multidimensional nature of poverty as well as the combined failures of both markets and governments and the socio-political complexity of ground level realities has made it clear that relying on traditional top-down, state-led, ―big development‖ strategies would not be effective to combat poverty. Moreover, this resurgence in participatory development and bottom-up approaches in the NGO and [[development sector]] has come in only the last two decades as explained above.

== Expansion of community-driven development ==
Since the mid-1990s, community-driven development has emerged as one of the fastest-growing investments by NGOs, [[aid organization]]s and multilateral developments banks. This continued investment in CDD has been driven mostly by a demand from donor agencies and developing countries for large-scale, bottom-up and demand-driven, [[poverty reduction]] subprojects that can increase the institutional capacity of small communities for self-development.&lt;ref&gt;Petr Matous: [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09614524.2013.772116 The making and unmaking of community-based water supplies in Manila], Development in Practice, Volume 23, Issue 2, 2013, p. 217-231.&lt;/ref&gt; The success and scale of some CDD projects in the World Bank are especially notable. The World Bank supported approximately 190 lending projects amounting to $9.3 billion in 2000–2005 (Tanaka, 2006). Initiated by the [[International Development Association]] (IDA) at the World Bank, CDD projects have been instrumental in harnessing the energy and capacity of communities for poverty reduction. Since the start of this decade, IDA lending for CDD has averaged annually just over 50 operations, for an average total of US$1.3 billion per year (International Development Association, 2009).

Even the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has funded 57 projects worth about $2.5 billion between 2001-2007 that included community-driven development approaches to enhance deliver of inputs and beneficiary participation. They constituted 14% of the total loans approved by the Asian Development Bank during this period. Over one-third of the projects were in the [[agriculture]] and [[natural resources]] sector, followed by a smaller proportion of [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]], [[waste management]], [[education]] and [[health]] projects. The projects were primarily in [[Southeast Asia]], [[South Asia]], and [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[West Asia]], where the [[developing country]] governments were investing in [[rural development]] programs (Asian Development Bank, 2008).

In the last few years the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] has been working with the [[French Development Agency|Agence française de développement]] (AFD), the [[African Development Bank]] (AfDB), the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]] (FAO), the [[UN Capital Development Fund]] (UNCDF) and the [[World Bank]] to create a platform for learning and sharing knowledge on community-driven development (International Fund for Agricultural Development, 2010). Intensive forms of community participation have been attempted in projects of several donors for many years. [[Bilateral donor]]s, such as the [[Department for International Development]] (DFID) of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA), have used CDD-type approaches for a long time as part of their sustainable livelihoods and integrated basic needs development assistance in developing countries. The [[Swedish International Development Agency]] (SIDA) and [[Danish International Development Agency]] have used CDD principles in the mandate of a rights-based approach to the development projects they fund (FAO, 2010).

More than 80 countries have now implemented CDD projects. The breadth and activities funded by the CDD programs at the World Bank can be explained by providing a brief overview of a few of them.

The Second [[National Fadama Development Project II]] (NFDP-II) targets the development of small scale [[irrigation]], especially in the low-lying alluvial floodplains or "[[Fadama]]‖. NFDP-II increased the productivity, living standards and development capacity of the economically active rural communities while increasing the efficiency in delivering implementation services to an estimated four million rural beneficiary households and raising the real incomes of households by 45 percent (African Development Bank, 2003). The [[Social Fund for Development]] in [[Yemen]] provided support 7 million people of which 49 percent were female and generated 8,000 permanent jobs. It also increased the number of girls‘ schools from 502 to 554 and [[basic education]] enrollment rates from 63 percent to 68 percent. The program focuses on helping the poor to help themselves through providing income-generating activities and building [[community infrastructure]] rather than making cash transfers (El-Gammal, 2004). The [[Social Investment Fund Project V]] in [[Honduras]] benefited 2.5 million people with the implementation of 2,888 projects (1,446 rehabilitated schools, about 700 new schools, 163 new health centers, 347 small water/sanitation systems, and 461 latrines) resulting in all children in the targeted areas attending [[primary school]]. In addition the project communities were provided with better access to health care assistance and access to running water (Perez de Castillo, 1998). The [[Andhra Pradesh Rural Poverty Reduction Project]] (APRPRP) in [[India]] has help to organize 10.1 million rural poor women into community-based organizations that collectively save over US$770 million and leverage credit over $2.7 billion from commercial banks (World Bank, 2003). The [[Kecamatan Development Program]] (KDP) in [[Indonesia]] which is what the [[National Solidarity Program]] in [[Afghanistan]] is based on has benefitted 18 million people by providing better services which include more than 37,000 kilometers of local roads and 8,500 bridges, 9,200 clean [[water supply]] units, and 3,000 new or improved health posts. In addition, more than 1.3 million people obtained loans to start or complement local businesses through [[microfinancing]] (Guggenheim, 2004). Lastly, the National Solidarity Programme (NSP) in Afghanistan will be the focus of this research. In this implementation elected village-level community development councils, which include women, use grants and local labor to rebuild bridges and roads, fix schools and install [[water pump]]s to benefit 13 million people across Afghanistan thereby building state credibility and strengthening local [[democracy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19894">The '''conservation and restoration of Pompeian frescoes''' describes the activities, methods, and techniques that have historically and are currently being used to care for the preserved remains of the [[fresco]]es from the archeological site of [[Pompeii]], Italy. The ancient city of Pompeii is famously known for its demise in A.D. 79 after the fatal eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] wiped out the population and buried the city beneath layers of compact lava material.&lt;ref name=:1&gt;Moormann, E. M. (1987). Destruction and restoration of Campanian mural paintings in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In S. Cather (Ed.), The Conservation Of Wall Paintings (87-101). Retrieved from http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/pdf/wall_paintings.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1738, [[Charles III of Spain|King Charles III]] or Charles of Bourbon, began explorations in [[Portici]], [[Resina]], [[Castellammare di Stabia]], a Civita, where it was believed that the ancient cities of Pompeii, Stabiae, and [[Herculaneum]] were buried beneath.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt; The first phase of the excavations at Pompeii started in 1748, which lead to the first conservation and restoration efforts of the frescoes since their burial,&lt;ref name=:2&gt;De Caro, S. (2015). Excavation and conservation at Pompeii. The Journal of Fasti Online: Archaeological Conservation. Retrieved from  http://www.fastionline.org/docs/FOLDER-con-2015-3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1764, open-air excavations began at Pompeii.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt; Pompeii has a long history of excavation and restoration that began without a strong foundation or strategy.&lt;ref name=:3&gt;Hammer, J.

Retrieved from https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/fall-rise-fall-pompeii-180955732/&lt;/ref&gt; After centuries of cronyism, recurring financial shortages, and on-again-off-again restoration, the city's frescoes and structures were left in poor condition.&lt;ref name=:3/&gt; In 1997, Pompeii was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|List of World Heritage Sites]].&lt;ref name=:2/&gt;

== Significant sites ==

=== Villa of the Mysteries ===
The [[Villa of the Mysteries]] is one of the best preserved homes in Pompeii.&lt;ref name=:4&gt;Cascone, S. (23 March, 2015). Pompeii unveils restoration of Dionysian frescoes at villa of mysteries. Artnetnews. Retrieved from https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/pompeii-villa-of-mysteries-restored-280342 &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Villa of P. Fannius Synistor at Boscoreale ===
The Villa of P. Fannius Synistor at [[Boscoreale]] was excavated in 1900 and many of the frescoes were stripped from the walls and auctioned off. One of the more notable conservation and restoration projects has taken place at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, NY, where they have restored and installed the paintings (2002-2007) from the Villa’s cubiculum, or bedroom, for the new Greek and Roman Galleries.&lt;ref name=:5&gt;Meyer, R.

=== House of the Vettii ===
The excavation of the [[House of the Vettii]] from 1894-1895 by Giuseppe Fiorelli led to the policy of completely restoring and reconstructing (select) houses and leaving all finds ''in situ'' as far as possible.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt; The House of the Vettii, located in Regio VI of Pompeii, suffered significant damage and loss of its fourth style artwork during bombings in [[WWII]].&lt;ref name=:6&gt;AD 79 Destruction and Re-discovery. (n.d.). House of the vettii. Retrieved from https://sites.google.com/site/ad79eruption/pompeii/regio-vi/reg-vi-ins-15/house-of-the-vettii&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Praedia of Julia Felix ===
The [[House of Julia Felix|Praedia of Julia Felix]], located in Regio II of Pompeii, was one of the first houses to be thoroughly explored and is the site where the first complete [[mural]] of the tablinum was detached in 1755, led by sculptor Joseph Canart.&lt;ref name=:2/&gt;

== Composition and materials ==

=== Pigments ===
The pigments that were primarily used in the frescoes at Pompeii were mostly naturally occurring earth pigments such as:
* Red and yellow [[ochre]]s 
* [[Green earth]]
* [[Calcium carbonate]] (chalk) 
* Black produced from soot or charcoal 
* Egyptian blue (artificial pigment consisting of ground blue glass [[frit]])  
* Bright red [[cinnabar]] (toxic mercuric sulfide)&lt;ref name=:5/&gt;

=== Application ===
Pompeian frescoes were executed in the [[buon fresco]] (true fresco) technique, in which the pigments were painted onto a freshly applied, damp/wet plaster ground. The plaster contains liquid lime ([[calcium hydroxide]]). In the process of drying, the liquid lime in the plaster combines with the paints and turns into carbonate of lime, which is chemically equivalent to limestone or marble. Upon drying and setting, the pigments permanently fuse to the plaster to form a solid, durable painting.&lt;ref name=:5/&gt;

== Examination and analysis of frescoes ==
After the [[1980 Irpinia earthquake|Irpinia earthquake in 1980]] caused further weakening of Pompeii’s crumbling walls, systematic initiatives were put into place to evaluate the damage. The excavation team took documentary photographs, conducted a systematic survey, and recorded the qualitative data through a computer processing system.&lt;ref name=:2/&gt; From these findings, Mariette de Vos calculated that the number of existing paintings made up only ten percent of what was originally found in earlier excavations, while another ten percent was only known through drawings and photos.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt; For the first time, the team was able to show that Pompeii had indeed been over-excavated, and provide a comprehensive view of how, where, and to what extent conservation and restoration was needed.&lt;ref name=:2/&gt;

With innovative advances in technology, conservationists and archaeologists have now been able to reconstruct navigable [[3-D modeling|3-D models]] of the ancient Pompeian buildings and the rooms that held the frescoes. Through virtual models, and the introduction of digital architectural line drawings, missing parts of the frescoes have been virtually filled in.&lt;ref name=:5/&gt; The use of archival photographs of the frescoes from past excavations and reconstructions have also aided in the digital reconstruction of the paintings, and have allowed for their digital preservation for the future.&lt;ref name=:7&gt;Watts-Plumpkin, E. (7 January, 2012). What’s new in Pompei. World Archaeology. Retrieved from https://www.world-archaeology.com/issues/pompeii/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laser]]s, [[Ultrasonic testing|ultrasound]] and [[Thermography|thermal imagery]] have been used to analyze the frescoes and their level of deterioration.&lt;ref name=:4/&gt; Non-invasive measurements have been used to research and measure the level of fading, discoloration, and changes in chemical composition that have taken place in the original pigments of the frescoes, such as: VIS (Visible Light) [[spectroscopy]] with CIE L*a*b* measurements and EDXRF (Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence) analyses; OM ([[Optical Microscopy]]) of cross sections and paint layers; [[Polarized light microscopy|PLM (Polarized Light Microscopy)]] of powder samples; FTIR/ATR ([[Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy]]/Attenuated Total Reflectance); and SEM-EDS (Scanning Electron Microscope-Energy Dispersive Spectrometry).&lt;ref name=:8&gt;EVTEK.

Extensive visitor observations and movement mapping have also been conducted in order to analyze how tourism impacts the safety of the frescoes.&lt;ref name=:9&gt;Wallace, A. (2012).

== Agents of deterioration ==

=== Physical ===
During the beginning of the excavation of Pompeii, inexperienced and untrained excavators cut out pieces of fresco they found without the use of linen and other facing materials to protect the plaster, resulting in many frescoes being broken into multiple fragments. Wall painting scenes that were considered worthy of detachment were brought to the Palazzo degli Studi in Naples, today known as the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, after 1827.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt;
[[File:Roman fresco Villa dei Misteri Pompeii 006.jpg|thumb|Roman fresco Villa dei Misteri Pompeii]]

The frescoes have been affected by rain and groundwater, which have caused water damage and [[Rising damp (structural)|rising damp]], resulting in deteriorating and collapsing walls.&lt;ref name=:10&gt;Ministero dei Beni e delle Attivita Culturali e del Turismo. (2016). Rapport de l'Etat partie sur l'état de conservation. UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Retrieved from http://whc.unesco.org/en/documents/155410&lt;/ref&gt; Frescoes are part of an open physical system in which they are in contact with contiguous structures—such as walls, roofs, and the ground—that are dynamically involved in series of chemical and physical events, such as the capillary movement and rise of moisture.&lt;ref name=:11&gt;Matteini, M. (1987). In review: An assessment of florentine methods of wall painting conservation based on the use of mineral treatments. In S. Cather (Ed.), The Conservation Of Wall Paintings (137-149). Retrieved from http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/pdf/wall_paintings.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; Catastrophic physical forces such as earthquakes—which have been causing structural damage to the buildings and cracks in the walls since A.D. 62&lt;ref name=:5/&gt; —and the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, have contributed to the deterioration of the frescoes. The frescoes of Pompeii were both damaged by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius from heat and falling debris, which scratched and loosened the plaster and paint,&lt;ref name=:5/&gt; and simultaneously preserved by the volcanic ash until their discovery. In addition, the frost of 1816 entirely destroyed murals in the [[Amphitheatre of Pompeii|Amphitheatre]] in the Villa of Cicero at the Praedia of Julia Felix.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt;

Restoration efforts in the late eighteenth century resulted in poorly supported walls and masonry that have proven insufficient for the protection of the wall paintings and have contributed to their rapid degradation.&lt;ref name=:2/&gt; Plaster was fixed with heavy metal clamps, which have gradually come away and left holes and other damage, and the edges of the paintings were smeared with ordinary [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] that has yet to be replaced.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt;

Mass tourism that has taken place at Pompeii is another contributing factor to the deterioration of the frescoes. Wear and breakage have occurred due to people leaning on and touching the frescoes, as well as abrasions from bags and other objects rubbing against the frescoes in crowded areas.&lt;ref name=:9/&gt; Vandals have also defaced the frescoes with graffiti. In addition, the frescoes at Pompeii have deteriorated due to poor management, decreased internal maintenance, and a lack of sustainable methods for restoration and conservation.&lt;ref name=:12&gt;Wollner, J.L. (2013). Planning preservation in pompeii: Revising wall painting conservation method and management. Studies in Mediterranean Antiquity and Classics, 3:1. Retrieved from http://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1023&amp;context=classicsjournal&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemical ===
The constituent materials of wall paintings have a high and open [[porosity]]. Because of this, they are easily accessible to liquids and gases including: salt solutions, atmospheric pollutants, water vapor, solutions of materials used for conservation, etc.&lt;ref name=:11/&gt; Build-up from pollutants and contaminants such as waxes and gasoline—which were used in previous restoration attempts as cleaning agents—varnishes, and dust have caused the pigments in the frescoes to darken and discolor, and the figures to blur over time.&lt;ref name=:3/&gt;

Many of the frescoes were covered with varnish to protect them at their creation, in which the fragments were first washed with water and then covered with [[gum arabic]] thinned with [[aqua regia]]. However, this practice was later stopped once it was discovered that it bleached and damaged the pigments, though most of the fragments at the Museo Archeologico Nazionale are still covered in the gluey film.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt;

Experiments with hot wax were conducted by the ancient Pompeian painters. Painters either prepared the surfaces with melted wax or painted with pigments combined with wax that would then be burned into the plaster, which made them sturdy and durable.&lt;ref name=:1 /&gt; This same technique was tried in order to restore the frescoes in the late eighteenth century. While at first this made the paintings more lustrous and clear, years of heat and humidity and the restriction of normal evaporation for the paintings ''in situ'' turned the wax white and deteriorated the painted surfaces.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt; In the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, though they didn’t suffer from the same climatological effects, they still became white/crusty.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt;

The pigments used in the frescoes are of a very fragile nature and have faded as a result of exposure to [[UV]] rays, oxygen, and the environment/elements—especially those left ''in situ''.&lt;ref name=:9/&gt; Disintegration of plaster, and lifting and detachment of the paint has also been caused by the crystallization of soluble salts, such as sodium nitrate, in the surface layers of the frescoes as a result of fluctuating temperatures and humidity, and exposure to atmospheric pollutants.&lt;ref name=:11/&gt;
 
=== Biological ===
Invasive vegetation such as roots, moss, weeds, and grass have sprouted from the cracks in the eroded floors and walls of the rooms where the frescoes are located.&lt;ref name=:3/&gt;

== Preventive conservation ==
Conservators and leadership are working to better understand the current situation of the Pompeian frescoes and avoid further damage and deterioration. The Soprintendenza Speciale per i Beni Archeologici di Napoli e Pompei is working on a major reorganization and implementation of new policies and maintenance plans for the entire site of Pompeii.&lt;ref name=:12/&gt;

Attention has been given to non-intrusive and reversible reinforcement of the walls, structures and roofs of the buildings that house the frescoes. Recommendations have been made for the reconstruction of the building infrastructures using safe and sturdy materials, and light, modern supports, unlike the previous heavy materials placed in the walls, which caused significant damage.&lt;ref name=:12/&gt; Recommendations have also been made for roof reinforcement structures and other conservation interventions that block ventilation and rain infiltration,&lt;ref name=:10/&gt; and allow for humidity regulation to prevent the plaster of the frescoes from peeling off the walls.&lt;ref name=:12/&gt; Plans for engineering new drainage and sewer systems are also being made.&lt;ref name=:10/&gt;

Excavations of Pompeii have been significantly reduced, and barricades, fences, and locked doors have been placed to keep visitors out of vulnerable areas and buildings.&lt;ref name=:9/&gt; Select ''insulae'' are also being considered for re-burial in order to protect them from further vegetal growth, weather conditions, earthquake damage, and volcanic eruptions.&lt;ref name=:12/&gt;

As an open, reactive system, frescoes require more surveillance after conservation&lt;ref name=:11/&gt; The use of high-tech monitoring tools is also being put into place. An agreement was made with Italian technology and defense company, [[Finmeccanica]], for their donation of services concerning: protection of the artistic heritage from deterioration, pollution, hydrogeological and seismic risks; efficiency, sustainability and safety of the spaces dedicated to culture; and accessibility and fruition of the artistic heritage.&lt;ref name=:10/&gt;

The project includes an [[interferometric]] monitoring service that provides data on the shifts/movements of the grounds and buildings in Pompeii, and comes equipped with radar sensors that shoot daytime and nighttime pictures. Finmeccanica has also provided a ground-based remote sensing service that employs hyper-spectral imaging devices for the acquisition of images and the spectral signatures of the various materials and chemical components present in areas identified as critical.&lt;ref name=:10/&gt;

== Current conservation treatment techniques and methods ==
Efforts are being made to stabilize the frescoes' chemical and biological degradation and perform long-lasting restoration. In a holistic approach to conservation, the causes of decay are being addressed while increasing the site’s ability to prevent or slow future decay. Routine cleaning of all previously restored works and constant upkeep practices are being put into place.&lt;ref name=:12/&gt;

Conservators and restorers are meticulously stripping away layers of [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]], dirt, and varnish with cotton swabs that restorers applied between the 1930s and 1970s to prevent the paints from cracking and flaking.&lt;ref name=:3/&gt; Laser tools are being used to melt away wax and gasoline buildup while leaving the paint untouched.&lt;ref name=:3/&gt; Other conservation treatments include the consolidation of brittle plaster and paint layers, the removal of inadequate [[inpainting]] of losses, and improving old fills that were used with cement.&lt;ref name=:5/&gt;

== The Great Pompeii Project (Grande Progetto Pompei) ==
The Great Pompeii Project (GPP) is a €105 million project funded by the EU and Italian Government that began in 2012. The project proposes plans for emergency work to begin for the conservation, maintenance and restoration of Pompeii.&lt;ref name=:13&gt;Parco Archeologico di Pompei. (n.d.). Pompeii projects.

'''Cycling probe technology''' (CPT) is a [[molecular biology|molecular biological]] technique for detecting specific [[DNA]] sequences. CPT operates under [[isothermal]] conditions.  In some applications, CPT offers an alternative to [[PCR]]. However, unlike PCR, CPT does not generate multiple copies of the target DNA itself, and the amplification of the signal is linear, in contrast to the exponential amplification of the target DNA in PCR. CPT uses a sequence specific chimeric probe which hybridizes to a complementary target DNA sequence and becomes a substrate for [[RNase H]]. Cleavage occurs at the RNA internucleotide linkages and results in dissociation of the probe from the target, thereby making it available for the next probe molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhatt R, Scott B, Whitney S, Bryan RN, Cloney L, Lebedev A | title = Detection of nucleic acids by cycling probe technology on magnetic particles: high sensitivity and ease of separation | journal = Nucleosides &amp; Nucleotides | volume = 18 | issue = 6-7 | pages = 1297–9 | date = 1999 | pmid = 10474219 | doi = 10.1080/07328319908044696 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[microfluidic chip|Integrated electrokinetic systems]] have been developed for use in CPT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tang T, Badal MY, Ocvirk G, Lee WE, Bader DE, Bekkaoui F, Harrison DJ | title = Integrated microfluidic electrophoresis system for analysis of genetic materials using signal amplification methods | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 74 | issue = 4 | pages = 725–33 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11866051 | doi = 10.1021/ac010874j }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Probe ==
Cycling probe technology makes use of a chimeric [[Hybridization probe|nucleic acid probe]] to detect the presence of a particular [[DNA]] sequence. The chimeric probe consists of an [[RNA]] segment sandwiched between two DNA segments. The RNA segment contains 4 contiguous [[purine]] nucleotides. The probes should be less than 30 nucleotides in length and designed to minimize intra-probe and inter-probe interactions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beggs ML, Cave MD, Marlowe C, Cloney L, Duck P, Eisenach KD | title = Characterization of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex direct repeat sequence for use in cycling probe reaction | journal = Journal of Clinical Microbiology | volume = 34 | issue = 12 | pages = 2985–9 | date = December 1996 | pmid = 8940435 | pmc = 229446 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
Cycling probe technology utilizes a cyclic, isothermal process that begins with the [[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridization]] of the chimeric probe with the target DNA. Once hybridized, the probe becomes a suitable substrate for [[Ribonuclease H|RNase H]]. RNase H, an [[endonuclease]], cleaves the RNA portion of the probe, resulting in two chimeric fragments. The [[Nucleic acid thermodynamics|melting temperature]] (T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) of the newly cleaved fragments is lower than the melting temperature of original probe. Because the CPT reaction is isothermally kept just above the melting point of the original probe, the cleaved fragments dissociate from the target DNA. Once dissociated, the target DNA is free to hybridize with a new probe, beginning the cycle again.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fong WK, Modrusan Z, McNevin JP, Marostenmaki J, Zin B, Bekkaoui F | title = Rapid solid-phase immunoassay for detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus using cycling probe technology | journal = Journal of Clinical Microbiology | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 2525–9 | date = July 2000 | pmid = 10878037 | pmc = 86959 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fragments have been cleaved and dissociated, they become detectable. A common strategy for detecting the fragments involves [[Fluorescence in the life sciences|fluorescence]]. With this method, a fluorescent marker is attached to the 5’ end of the probe and a [[Quenching (fluorescence)|quencher]] is attached to the 3’ end of the probe.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buh Gasparic M, Cankar K, Zel J, Gruden K | title = Comparison of different real-time PCR chemistries and their suitability for detection and quantification of genetically modified organisms | journal = BMC Biotechnology | volume = 8 | pages = 26 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18325084 | pmc = 2322970 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6750-8-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When RNase H cleaves the probe, the quencher and fluorescent marker separate, increasing the intensity of the fluorescent marker. Cleaved fragments can alternatively be detected via amplification (e.g., [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]) or further modification to allow for other chemical means of detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolcott MJ | title = Advances in nucleic acid-based detection methods | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 370–86 | date = October 1992 | pmid = 1423216 | pmc = 358255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When working with small concentrations of target DNA, the CPT protocol can be modified to increase specificity and efficiency. Increasing allotted time has been shown to improve probe cleavage efficiency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Both increasing RNase H concentrations and use of a probe that isn’t prone to inter-probe and intra-probe interactions has been show to increase specificity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Because cycling probe technology does not involve the amplification of target DNA, CPT has a lower risk of [[Polymerase chain reaction optimization|cross contamination]] than PCR.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, CPT is faster than PCR&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and doesn’t require a specialized [[Thermal cycler|thermocycler]]. CPT also does not require running CPT products on a [[Gel electrophoresis|gel]].

== Disadvantages ==
CPT requires specialized chimeric probes, making CPT assays more expensive than PCR.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Because CPT probes are so specific, a new probe must be designed for each unique assay, further increasing cost. Clinical implementation is hampered financially, but it is also limited by the possibility of samples containing nonspecific [[RNAse|RNases]] other than RNase H.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Applications ==
CPT can be used to detect specific DNA sequences and by extension specific [[genotype]]s. For example CPT can be used to distinguish [[Genetically modified organism|GMO]] produce from non-GMO produce.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Clinically, CPT can be used as an alternative to cell culturing in order to detect [[Antimicrobial resistance|antibacterial resistance]] of a pathogen.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

CPT, at its core,  detects whether a specific sequence is present in a sample. But because cleaved probes accumulate following [[Rate equation|linear rate kinetics]], the amount of target DNA can be quantified. Consequently, CPT has been used to quantify the number of non-coding repeats in organisms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

CPT can be used in conjunction with other technologies, like [[molecular beacon]]s and [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|qPCR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jacroux T, Rieck DC, Cui R, Ouyang Y, Dong WJ | title = Enzymatic amplification of DNA/RNA hybrid molecular beacon signaling in nucleic acid detection | journal = Analytical Biochemistry | volume = 432 | issue = 2 | pages = 106–14 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23000602 | pmc = 3522425 | doi = 10.1016/j.ab.2012.09.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deaf education''' is the education of students with any degree of [[hearing loss|hearing loss or deafness]] which addresses their differences and individual needs. This process involves individually-planned, systematically-monitored teaching methods, adaptive materials, accessible settings and other interventions designed to help students achieve a higher level of self-sufficiency and success in the school and community than they would achieve with a typical classroom education. A number of countries focus on training teachers to teach deaf students with a variety of approaches and have organizations to aid deaf students.

==Identifying deaf students==
{{expand section|date=January 2013}}
Children may be identified as candidates for deaf education from their [[audiogram]] or medical history. Hearing loss is generally described as slight, mild, moderate, severe, or profound, depending upon how well a person can hear the intensities of frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nichcy.org/disability/specific/hearingloss|title=Disabilities - Center for Parent Information and Resources|website=nichcy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the children identified as deaf, only 10% are born to deaf parents.{{failed verification|date=February 2017}} This percent of deaf students may have a linguistic advantage when entering the education system due to more extensive exposure to a first language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Ross E.|last2=Karchmer|first2=Michael A.|date=2004-02-03|title=Chasing the Mythical Ten Percent: Parental Hearing Status of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Students in the United States|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/51652|journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=4|issue=2|pages=138–163|doi=10.1353/sls.2004.0005|issn=1533-6263|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents can start to notice differences in their kids hearing as soon as newborn to three months old. If a child doesn't respond to sudden loud sounds, this could be an indication. As the baby begins to age to around four to eight months, they should turn their head towards where the sound is coming from. Around a year to 16 months, if they don't pronounce words correctly, or don't speak at all, this could also be an indication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.babycenter.com/0_warning-signs-of-a-hearing-problem-in-a-baby_6748.bc|title=hearing problems|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All those are indications of cognitive hearing loss, which means the child was born this way. 

A child can also acquire hearing loss at a young age due to a middle ear infection, a serious head injury, exposure to loud noises over a long period time, and many other ways. If this occurs, the same symptoms would occur as they do with cognitive hearing loss. If this happens when a child is older, around toddler or preschool age, there are more signs to look for. Signs could include a child not replying when their name is called. The child may pronounce words differently than the rest of their peers. If the child turns up the TV incredibly high or sits very close, this could also be an indication. One of the biggest indications that a child may have hearing loss is when they are having a conversation with someone, they intensely focus on the person's lips and facial expressions to understand what they are saying. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.healthyhearing.com/help/hearing-loss/children|title=Hearing loss in children: Everything you need to know|work=Healthy Hearing|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a child has these signs, getting a screening for hearing loss would be the next step.

==Individual needs==
Deaf education programs must be customized to each student's needs, and deaf educators provide a continuum of services to deaf students based on individual needs.&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;{{cite book |author=Goodman, Libby |title=Time and learning in the special education classroom |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, N.Y. |year=1990 |page= 122 |ISBN=0-7914-0371-8 |OCLC=20635959}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if a student is in a regular class, a note taker or interpreter might be an accommodation provided in their education plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://successforkidswithhearingloss.com/relationship-hl-listen-learn/accommodations/|title=Accommodations for Students with Hearing Loss|last=Anderson|first=Karen|date=August 2012|website=Supporting Success for Children with Hearing Loss|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, Canada and the UK, education professionals use the acronym [[Individualized Education Program|IEP]] when referring to a student’s individualized education plan.

=={{anchor|Methods of provision}}Methods==
Schools use a number of approaches to provide deaf-educational services to identified students. These may be grouped into four categories, according to whether (and how much) the deaf student has contact with non-deaf students (using North American terminology):
* ''[[Inclusion (education)|Inclusion]]:'' Deaf students spend all, or most, of the school day with non-deaf students. Since inclusion requires considerable curriculum modification, it is considered [[best practice]] only for mildly-to-moderately deaf students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith, P |title=Have we made any progress, including students with intellectual disabilities in regular education classrooms? |journal=Intellect Dev Disabil |volume=45 |issue=5 |pages=297–309 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17887907 |doi=10.1352/0047-6765(2007)45[297:HWMAPI]2.0.CO;2 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3130/is_n4_v54/ai_n28582666/pg_2/?tag=content;col1|title=Integrated classroom versus resource model: academic viability and effectiveness |author=James Q. Affleck |author2=Sally Madge|author3=Abby Adams|author4=Sheila Lowenbraun |date=January 1988|journal=Exceptional Children|page=2|accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specialized services may be provided inside or outside the regular classroom, and students may leave the regular classroom to attend smaller, intensive instructional sessions in a [[resource room]] or to receive other services requiring specialized equipment or which might be disruptive to the rest of the class (such as [[speech and language therapy]]).&lt;ref name=Bowe&gt;{{cite book |author=Bowe, Frank |title=Making Inclusion Work |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Upper Saddle River, N.J |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-13-017603-6 |oclc=54374653}}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Mainstreaming (education)|Mainstreaming]]'' refers to the education of deaf students in classes with non-deaf students for specified time periods, based on the deaf students' skills; deaf students learn in separate classes for the remainder of the school day.&lt;ref name=Zittleman2006&gt;{{cite book |author=Karen Zittleman|author2=Sadker, David Miller

* ''Segregation'' (in a separate classroom or school): In this model, deaf students spend no time in non-deaf classes or with non-deaf students. Segregated students may attend a school where non-deaf classes are provided, but spend their time in a separate classroom for students with special needs. If their special-needs class is in a mainstream school, they may have opportunities for social integration (for example, eating meals with non-deaf students);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/warnock/warnock07.html Warnock Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111230317/http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/warnock/warnock07.html |date=January 11, 2013 }} (1978).  "Report of the Committee of Enquiry into the Education of Handicapped Children and Young People", London.&lt;/ref&gt; alternatively, deaf students may attend a [[Special education#Special schools|special school]].&lt;ref name=Zittleman2006/&gt;
* ''Exclusion:''  A student unable to receive instruction in any school is excluded from school. Most deaf students have historically been excluded from school,&lt;ref&gt;Wolffe, Jerry. (20 December 2010) [http://www.theoaklandpress.com/articles/2010/12/20/news/doc4d0fc3a6b0867472513928.txt?viewmode=fullstory What the law requires for disabled students] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130105014730/http://www.theoaklandpress.com/articles/2010/12/20/news/doc4d0fc3a6b0867472513928.txt?viewmode=fullstory |date=2013-01-05 }} ''The Oakland Press''.&lt;/ref&gt; and exclusion may still occur where there is no legal mandate for special-education services (such as developing countries). It may also occur when a student is in hospital or housebound.&lt;ref name=Zittleman2006/&gt; Excluded students may receive individual or group instruction, and students who have been [[suspension (punishment)|suspended]] or [[expulsion (academia)|expelled]] are not considered "excluded" in this sense.
The difference between mainstreaming and inclusion is not made explicit in the law, and use may vary from district to district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yell|first1=Mitchell L.|title=The law and special education|date=2012|publisher=Pearson|location=Upper Saddle River|isbn=978-0131376090|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, within the Deaf community, the term 'mainstreaming' often refers to any educational setting outside of a residential school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bat-Chava|first1=Yael|title=Diversity of Deaf Identities|journal=American Annals of the Deaf|date=11 July 2012|volume=145|issue=5|pages=420–428|doi=10.1353/aad.2012.0176|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/384063/pdf|issn=1543-0375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid harming the students' accuracy and fluency in either language, sign language and spoken language are not used simultaneously, since they use different grammar, syntax, and vocabulary; sign language is usually used as the language of instruction, though some bilingual-bicultural schools use spoken language in some contexts with some students.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Many bilingual-bicultural schools have dormitories; students may either commute to school or stay in a dormitory as part of a residential program, visiting their families on weekends, holidays and school vacations.

=== Auditory-oral and auditory-verbal education===

===Simultaneous or Total Communication===
There is great variety in programs that label themselves as using [[simultaneous communication]] or total communication. Some programs consist of teachers and children speaking and signing at the same time, known as simultaneous communication.&lt;ref name="RDKTC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.raisingdeafkids.org/communicating/choices/tc.php|title=Total Communication: Learning to Use Different Communication Methods|website=Raising Deaf Kids|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these programs, grammatically-correct English is available when speech is paired with [[Signing Exact English]]. This method is used in many programs in Texas and in the state of Washington at Northwest School for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Children. In total communication programs, however, teachers emphasize learning language and utilizing all means of communication.&lt;ref name="RDKTC" /&gt; Most often these programs do not use a grammatically correct form of either English or American Sign Language. Rather, professionals use a mixture of oral languages and signed languages or systems, including natural gestures, fingerspelling, body language, and lip-reading—most often paired with some degree of listening and speaking practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.handsandvoices.org/comcon/articles/totalcom.htm|title=Communication Considerations: Total Communication|website=Hands and Voices|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
[[Charles-Michel de l'Épée]] pioneered deaf education in [[France]]. He did charitable work for the poor, and on one trip into the Paris slums saw two young, deaf sisters who communicated with a [[sign language]]. Épée then decided to dedicate himself to the education of the deaf, and founded a school in 1760. In line with the philosophy of the time, Épée believed that deaf people were capable of [[language]] and developed a system of teaching  [[French language|French]] and religion. During the early 1760s his shelter became the [[Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris]], the world's first public school for deaf children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.injs-paris.fr/sites/www.injs-paris.fr/files/cartel_historique-version_anglaise_1.docx|title=The national institute for the Deaf|website=Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Great Britain ===
The grandson of [[Sir John Popham]], Alexander, was born in 1650. He was either deaf at birth, or became so before acquiring speech. Two eminent men came to his home at [[Littlecote House]] to teach him to talk: [[John Wallis]], mathematician and cryptographer, and [[William Holder]], music theorist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Find could end 350-year science dispute|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7511446.stm|accessdate=5 May 2018|publisher=BBC|date=26 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first school for teaching the deaf to speak and read in Britain was [[Thomas Braidwood]]'s Academy for the Deaf and Dumb in [[Edinburgh]], established during the 1760s. The school moved to London in 1783.{{cn|date=May 2018}} Braidwood used an early form of sign language: the combined system, forerunner of [[British Sign Language]] (recognized as a language in 2003). Under the management of Braidwood's nephew the school expanded, encouraging the establishment of an Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb in [[Edgbaston]] in 1814 and others in [[Liverpool]], Edinburgh, [[Exeter]], [[Manchester Institution for the Deaf and Dumb|Manchester]] and [[Doncaster]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

=== United States ===
{{Main|History of deaf education in the United States}}
Deaf education in the United States began during the early 1800s, when the Cobbs School (an [[oralism|oral]] school) was established by William Bolling and John Braidwood and the [[American School for the Deaf|Connecticut Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb]] (a [[manualism|manual]] school) was established by [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]] and [[Laurent Clerc]]. When the Cobbs School closed in 1816, the manual method (which used [[American Sign Language]]) became common in deaf schools for most of the rest of the century. During the late 1800s schools began using the oral method, which only allowed the use of speech (in contrast to the manual method previously in place). The oral method was used for many years, until sign-language instruction gradually returned to deaf education.

{{expand section|date=January 2013}}
{{see also|Manualism|Oralism}}
Two general methods of deaf education are manualism and oralism. Manualism is instruction using [[sign language]], and oralism uses spoken language. Although controversy has existed since the early eighteenth century about which method is more effective, many deaf-educational facilities attempt to integrate both approaches.  The [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] advocates a bilingual approach, to best support deaf students in their education.&lt;ref&gt;National Association of the Deaf, [http://www.nad.org/issues/education/k-12/dual-language-development-and-use-educational-environment-position-statement Dual Language Development and Use in the Educational Environment Position Statement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204070707/http://www.nad.org/issues/education/k-12/dual-language-development-and-use-educational-environment-position-statement |date=2013-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{expand section|more worldwide coverage|date=January 2013}}

===United States===
{{Main|Deaf education in the United States}}
Some deaf students receive an individualized education program (IEP) outlining how the school will meet the student's individual needs. The [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) requires that students with special needs be provided with [[Free Appropriate Public Education]] in the [[least restrictive environment]] appropriate to the student's needs.  Government-run schools provide deaf education in varying degrees, from the least-restrictive setting (full inclusion) to the most restrictive (segregation in a deaf school).&lt;ref name=Zittleman2006/&gt; Education offered by the school must be appropriate to the student's individual needs; however, schools are not required to maximize the student's potential or provide the best possible services. Like most developed countries, American schools are  required to provide medical services (such as [[speech therapy]]) if the student needs those services. As technology improves, more solutions become available in classrooms. Things such as FM systems have been put into many schools. An FM system has two parts: the first is a microphone that the teacher wears around their neck while teaching. There are two ways the system is set up for the child. First, the FM radio waves can be directly set up with the child's hearing aid or cochlear implant, so the sound is amplified only to the certain child. The second is called a sound field. The sound field uses special speakers put strategically throughout the classroom. This increases sound to a whole classroom instead of just one student.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www3.gallaudet.edu/clerc-center/info-to-go/assistive-technology/assistive-technologies.html|title=Assistive Technologies for Individuals Who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing|last=Center|first=Gallaudet University and Clerc|website=www3.gallaudet.edu|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nepal===
Deaf children in Nepal have the right to free, qualified education in line with  provisions of the UN [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] (UNCRPD). However, education in a school for the deaf is limited to 13 dedicated schools for the deaf and a slightly-higher number of deaf resource classes in regular schools. All schools and classes are [[Bilingual Education|bilingual]], with [[Nepali Sign Language]] and written [[Nepali (language)|Nepali]] the [[medium of instruction|media of instruction]].

==Teacher training==
{{expand section|explanations of teacher training in respective countries|date=April 2014}}
Deaf education majors and degree programs offer training and certification in the education of students with a variety of hearing abilities, addressing students' individual differences and needs. Deaf education also includes the study of [[special education]], [[Deaf studies]], [[education]], [[sign language]] and [[Deaf culture]] (not all programs include the latter two).

[[File:Dri logo basic.png|thumb|right|Logo of the Desert Research Institute]]
'''Desert Research Institute''' ('''DRI''') is the nonprofit research campus of the [[Nevada System of Higher Education]] (NSHE), the organization that oversees all publicly supported higher education in the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[Nevada]]. At DRI, approximately 500 research faculty and support staff engage in more than $50 million in environmental research each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dri.edu/About/|title=About DRI|publisher=Desert Research Institute|accessdate=December 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; DRI's environmental research programs are divided into three core divisions (Atmospheric Sciences, Earth and Ecosystem Sciences, and Hydrologic Sciences) and two interdisciplinary centers (Center for Arid Lands Environmental Management and the Center for Watersheds and Environmental Sustainability). Established in 1988 and sponsored by [[AT&amp;T]], the institute's [[Nevada Medal]] awards "outstanding achievement in science and engineering".

==Programs==
;Cloud Seeding Program
DRI weather modification research produced the Nevada State Cloud Seeding Program in the 1960s. This initiative, funded by the [[United States Bureau of Reclamation|U.S. Bureau of Reclamation]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], seeks to augment [[Snow|snowfall]] in mountainous regions of Nevada in order to increase [[Snowpack|snow pack]] and water supply. DRI researchers use ground stations and aircraft to release microscopic [[silver iodide]] particles into winter clouds, stimulating the formation of ice crystals which develop to snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Synopsis of DRI Cloud Seeding Program|url=http://www.dri.edu/cloudseeding/synopsis|work=DRI Cloud Seeding Program|publisher=Desert Research Institute|accessdate=July 9, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222131732/http://www.dri.edu/cloudseeding/synopsis|archivedate=February 22, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research indicates that cloud seeding leads to precipitation rate increases of 0.1 - 1.5 millimeters per hour.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

;Atmospheric and Dispersion Modeling Program

They have developed a [[Outline of air pollution dispersion|Lagrangian]] Random Particle Dispersion Model that has been applied to complex coastal and inland environments.

Several recent projects led to developing real time mesoscale forecasting system using the MM5 model coupled with a Lagrangian random particle dispersion model and implementation of [[data assimilation]] schemes.

==History==
;Founder Dr. Wendell Mordy
A two-page bill, signed into law by then Nevada Governor Grant Sawyer on March 23, 1959, authorized establishment of the Desert Research Institute at the University of Nevada, Reno.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-nv-desert-research-institute-032009-2009mar20-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

UNR hired Dr. Wendell Mordy as the Founding Director (1960-1969) of the University's Desert Research Institute, which initially was just an office at the top of the historic [[Morrill_Hall_(University_of_Nevada,_Reno)|Morrill Hall]] building on UNR's campus. Early on Mordy also initiated the development of the [[Fleischmann_Planetarium_%26_Science_Center|UNR's Fleishmann Atmospherium Planetarium]].&lt;ref&gt;First-hand knowledge as the son of Edwin X Berry, who joined DRI in 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) Initiative''' is a global initiative which aims to increase awareness of the economic consequences of [[land degradation]] and promote [[sustainable land management]]. The ELD Initiative provides a platform for discussion between stakeholders from the policy, science, and private sectors, and is focused on developing globally relevant data and methodology on the economic benefits of land and land based ecosystems for decision makers. The Initiative highlights the benefits derived from adopting sustainable land management practices and seeks to establish a global economic analyses of land management. The ELD Initiative was co-founded by the Secretariat of the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)]], the [[Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development|German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ)]], the [[European Commission|European Commission (EC)]] and is hosted by the [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH]]. The ELD Secretariat is based in [[Bonn]], Germany.

==Background==
[[Land degradation]] and [[desertification]] threaten people’s livelihood on a global scale. Every year, 20 million hectares of fertile land become degraded and within the last 40 years, around one third of the total agricultural land on earth has become unproductive through degradation processes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmz.de/de/publikationen/themen/umwelt/Desertifikation.pdf BMZ on the German Engagement within the UNCCD]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Developing country|Less developed countries]] are more vulnerable to desertification and land degradation, as they lack the infrastructure and capital to deal with this threat and implement long-term [[sustainable land management]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eld-initiative.org/fileadmin/pdf/ELD-Interim_Report_web.pdf ELD Scientific Interim Report]&lt;/ref&gt; Soil on degraded land is less resilient and crops grown on degraded soil produce lower yields. 
Land degradation also negatively influences global [[food security]]: in the next 25 years, global food production might drop by up to 12%. This will lead to an increase in average food prices of up to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unccd.int/Lists/SiteDocumentLibrary/WDCD/DLDD%20Facts.pdf Global Facts and Figures on Desertification, Land Degradation and Drought by UNCCD]&lt;/ref&gt;
Estimates show that the annual costs of land degradation are up to €3.4 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eld-initiative.org/fileadmin/pdf/ELD_Business_Brief.pdf TEEB Interim Report in ELD Business Brief]&lt;/ref&gt; Paired with the growing world population and an increasing demand for alternative land management products such as biofuels land degradation causes poverty, food insecurity, reduced availability of clean water, and increased vulnerability towards [[climate change]] and extreme weather conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eld-initiative.org/fileadmin/pdf/ELD-Interim_Report_web.pdf ELD Scientific Interim Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

Land is covered by different [[ecosystem]]s, which can be valued to include all the services they provide to life on earth: supporting, regulating, provisioning and cultural [[Ecosystem services|services]]. These ecosystem services were estimated, in 2011 to have a global worth of USD 125 trillion/yr. This shows a decrease of USD 20.2 trillion/yr since 1997, caused by land use and management changes [http://eld-initiative.org/fileadmin/pdf/ELD-main-report_08_web-72dpi_01.pdf .&lt;sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[6]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;] Sustainable land management practices are not usually costly to take up, and could deliver up to USD 1.4 trillion, merely in crop production, if adopted [http://inweh.unu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ELD-Interim-Report-Web-Version4.pdf. .&lt;sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[7]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]

Achieving a land degradation neutral world by 2030 is now a stated target in the recently ratified United Nations [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDG’s), where Land Degradation Neutrality is explicitly outlined in the universally applicable target 15.3. The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) COP 12 decisions also explicitly recognizes the need for economic assessments of desertification, sustainable land management, and the resilience of rural areas. The ELD Initiative is in very close alignment and support of these targets in all of its efforts.

==Formation and partner organisations==
In 2010, a scientific foundation was created to promote the issues of sustainable land management and food security and increase public awareness for the importance of productive soils. In October 2011, a [[Memorandum of understanding]] was signed between the German [[Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development]], the [[European Commission]], and the permanent Secretariat to the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|(UNCCD)]]. Additionally, the [[Korea Forest Service]] supports the ELD Initiative as a political partner.

The ELD Initiative established a broad scientific network including the [http://drylandsystems.cgiar.org/ CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems], [http://inweh.unu.edu/ United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health (UNU-INWEH)], the [[Stockholm Environment Institute]], [[UNDP]], [[UNEP]], the [[Australian National University]], [[University of Leeds]], [[University of Wyoming]], the [http://www.unibe.ch/index_eng.html University of Bern,] [http://www.ifpri.org/ IFPRI],  [http://www.global-mechanism.org/ Global Mechanism] and [http://www.iucn.org/ IUCN]. 
The ELD Initiative further focuses on collaborating with the [[Private sector]] as one of the main drivers for land degradation processes&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/environmental_assessment_report_2003_10 &lt;nowiki&gt;[9]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;, to help businesses identify investment opportunities and incentives linked to the preservation and sustainable management of soils.

==  Vision ==
The partners’ vision of Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) Initiative is to transform global understanding of the value of land and create awareness of the economic case for sustainable land management that prevents loss of [[natural capital]], secures livelihoods, preserves ecosystem services, combats climate change, and addresses food, energy, and water security, and to create capacity for the utilisation of economic information for sustainable land management.

== Structure ==
Guided by Steering Group members and coordinated by the ELD Secretariat, the ELD Initiative produces reports, case studies, and other outputs. These outputs are compiled by its policy, private sector, and scientific partners. The ELD Secretariat is responsible for the coordination of processes within the Initiative and its communication, and also serves as first contact point for all existing and potential Partners.

Besides the Steering Group members, the ELD network includes senior experts from [[Crawford School of Public Policy]] - [[Australian National University]], [[Stockholm Environment Institute]] Africa Center, [[University of Leeds]], [[CGIAR]] ([[International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas|ICARDA]]), Korea Forest Service and international organizations such as UNEP, UNDP and IUCN, amongst others.

==Outputs==
As of mid-2014, the ELD Initiative has published a “Scientific Interim Report’’ which details the general approach and methods considered by the Initiative and a “Business Brief’’ which outlines a methodology for risk assessment. In 2015, the ELD Initiative published three additional reports; one main report titled ‘The Value of Land, as well as reports tailored for policy-/decision makers and the private sector. The ELD Initiative further offers [[Capacity building]] activities for decision-makers. In 2014 for example a first [[Massive Open Online Course|Massive Open Online Course (MOOC)]] on the Economics of Land Degradation was offered in cooperation with UNU-INWEH. A second Massive Open Online Course titled 'Options and Pathways for Action: Stakeholder Engagement' took place on May 5 - June 27, 2015.

In September 2015, ELD produced a comprehensive synthesis or ‘main’ document, [http://eld-initiative.org/fileadmin/pdf/ELD-main-report_08_web-72dpi_01.pdf The Value of Land]. This reference report details the monetary worth of land, the steps and methods that can be used to effectively conduct economic assessments of land values, and actions for the successful management and use thereof. Additionally, it provides global scenarios with information on important ecosystems and the potential future impacts based on the various possible economic conditions governing its management. The significance of stakeholder engagement is outlined with country-level examples.  The report was launched at the 70th United Nations General Assembly in Brussels. For video, see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PM9rwkQUKE here].

An ancillary [http://eld-initiative.org/fileadmin/pdf/ELD-pm-report_08_web_72dpi.pdf Report for Policy and Decision Makers] was released in parallel in September 2015, consisting of practical guidance and recommendations for policy-making in the use of economic instruments for sustainable management of land in the context of the SDG implementation process.

== Services and Products ==
The services offered by the ELD Initiative can be categorised into three key themes:  stakeholder dialogues, capacity-building as well as technical expertise and development of solutions. Such services and products can be outlined as follows:

* Total economic valuation methods which aid decision-making in land-use investments and planning.
* Building capacity amongst African, Asian and Central and Latin American countries to assess their land’s value.
* Providing practitioners and decision-makers with skills and tools to make an economic case for sustainable land management.
* Informing private sector of the opportunities available for investment in sustainable land management.
* Case studies on local regions with all the necessary information on the value of the land, relevant stakeholders, and methods of effectively managing land so as to be used more sustainably.

== Going Forward ==
After the presentation of the core reports the ELD Initiative in its coming Implementation Phase will be working on three key themes identified as targets are capacity development, awareness raising and communication, and knowledge management. ELD network partners have developed and discussed on strengths, weaknesses, and actions for the ELD going forward in this context.

Following various high-level presentations of the Initiative’s reports in the course of 2015, ELD has received a number of requests from national representatives for support through national studies and awareness raising activities. ELD Initiative will bring to bear the results of its scientific work and implement the ELD methodology in a number of additional national case studies closely linked with dialogues between decision makers and land managers, but also with capacity building activities in cooperation with local partners.

In this next phase, ELD aims to make economics of land degradation an integral part of policy strategies and decision making by increasing the political and public awareness of the costs and benefits of sustainable management of  land-based ecosystems and to increase the capacity to utilize economic data and [][http://drylandsystems.cgiar.org/content/success-and-strategy-eld-takes-bangkok methodology].

'''Environmental engineering law''' is a profession that requires an expertise in both [[environmental engineering]] and [[law]]. This field includes professionals with both a legal and environmental engineering education. This dual educational requirement is typically satisfied through an [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology|ABET]] accredited degree in environmental engineering and an [[American Bar Association|ABA]] accredited law degree. Likewise, this profession requires both licensure in professional environmental engineering&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.ncees.org/licensure/licensure_for_engineers/ NCEES Professional Engineer Licensure]&lt;/ref&gt; and admittance to one bar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbex.org/ National Conference of Bar Examiners]&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental engineering law is the professional application of law, [[science]] and [[engineering]] principles to improve the environment (air, water, and/or land resources), to provide healthy water, air, and land for human habitation and for other organisms, and to remediate polluted sites. Environmental engineering lawyers seek to promote the advancement of technical engineering knowledge in the legal profession and to enhance informed legal analysis of complex environmental matters.

==Practice areas==
Environmental engineering law professionals offer a sound knowledge base in the fields of both environmental engineering and law to address complex environmental problems which demand both professional technical practice and legal expertise. Areas of practice are continually expanding, but frequently include complex land transactions, such as: 

*[[Brownfield land|Brownfields]] redevelopment
*[[Asbestos]] [[Baseline (surveying)|baseline survey]] and [[building revaluation]] due to forthcoming [[asbestos abatement]]s
*[[Soil contamination]] assessment &amp; [[Environmental remediation|remediation]], the development of a [[remedial action workplan]] (RAWP) and [[engineering controls]], including an [[environmental land use restriction]] (ELUR)
*[[Total maximum daily load]] (TMDL) [[nutrient loading studies]] (ex. for [[NPDES]] wastewater discharges) and regulatory negotiation of [[nutrients discharge limits]] from [[waste treatment]] plants, such as [[phosphorus]] and [[nitrogen]].

'''Ethnic studies''', in the United States, is the [[interdisciplinary]] study of difference—chiefly race, ethnicity, and nation, but also sexuality, gender, and other such markings—and power, as expressed by the state, by civil society, and by individuals. Ethnic studies is an academic field that spans the humanities and the social sciences, it emerged as an academic field in the second half of the 20th century partly in response to charges that traditional social science and humanities disciplines such as [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[literature]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[cultural studies]], and [[area studies]] which were conceived from an inherently [[Eurocentric]] perspective. Its origin, then, lies in the civil rights era, when ethnic studies was originally conceived to re-frame the way that specific disciplines had told the stories, histories, struggles and triumphs of people of color on what was seen to be their own terms. In recent years, it has broadened its focus to include questions of representation, [[racialization]], [[racial formation theory]], and more determinedly interdisciplinary topics and approaches.

==History==
In the United States, the field of ethnic studies evolved out of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] during the 1960s and early 1970s, which contributed to growing self-awareness and radicalization of people of color such as African-Americans, Asian Americans, Latino Americans, and [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]]. Ethnic studies departments were established on college campuses across the country and have grown to encompass [[African American Studies]], [[Asian American Studies]], [[La Raza|Raza]] Studies, [[Chicano Studies]], Mexican American Studies, and [[Native American Studies]], as well as Jewish-American Studies and Italian-American Studies.
 
The first strike demanding the establishment of an Ethnic Studies department occurred in 1968, led by the [[Third World Liberation Front]] (TWLF), a joint effort of the Black Student Union, Latin American Students Organization, Asian American Political Alliance, Pilipino American Collegiate Endeavor, and Native American Students Union at [[San Francisco State University]]. This was the longest student strike in the nation's history, and resulted in the establishment of a School of Ethnic Studies. President [[S. I. Hayakawa]] ended the strike after taking a hardline approach,when he appointed Dr. James Hirabayashi the first dean of the School (now College) of Ethnic Studies at San Francisco State University,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/people/profile.php?profile=Hirabayashi, James]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increased recruiting and admissions of students of color in response to the strike's demands. In 1972, The National Association for Ethnic Studies was founded to foster interdisciplinary discussions for scholars and activists concerned with the national and international dimensions of ethnicity encouraging conversations related to anthropology, Africana Studies, Native Studies, Sociology and American Studies among other fields.

Minority students at The [[University of California at Berkeley]]- united under their own Third World Liberation Front, the TWLF, initiated the second longest student strike in the history of this country on January 22, 1969. The groups involved were the Mexican American Student Confederation, Asian American Political Alliance, African American Student Union, and the Native American group. The four co-Chairmen of the TWLF were Ysidro Macias, Richard Aoki, Charlie Brown, and LaNada Means.

This strike at Berkeley was even more violent than the San Francisco State strike, in that more than five police departments, the California Highway Patrol, Alameda County Deputies, and finally, the California National Guard were ordered onto the Berkeley campus by Ronald Reagan in the effort to quash the strike. The excessive use of police force has been cited with promoting the strike by the alienation of non-striking students and faculty, who protested the continual presence of police on the Berkeley campus. The faculty union voted to join the strike on March 2, and two days later the Academic Senate called on the administration to grant an interim Department of Ethnic Studies. On March 7, 1969, President Hitch authorized the establishment of the first Ethnic Studies Department in the country, followed by the establishment of the nation's first College of Ethnic Studies at [[San Francisco State University]] on March 20, 1969. 

Courses in ethnic studies address perceptions that, because of the Eurocentric bias and racial and ethnic prejudice of those in power, American historians have systematically ignored or undervalued the roles of such ethnic minorities as Asian Americans, Blacks, Mexicans, Latinos and Native Americans.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Ethnic studies also often encompasses issues of [[intersectionality]], where gender, class, and sexuality also come into play. There are now hundreds of African American, Asian American, Mexican American and Chicano/Latino Studies departments in the US, approximately fifty Native American Studies departments, and a small number of comparative ethnic studies programs. College students, especially on the East Coast, continue to advocate for Ethnic Studies departments. The Ethnic Studies Coalition at [[Wellesley College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thewellesleynews.com/2018/10/25/ethnic-studies-coalition-pushes-for-ethnic-studies-major-at-wellesley/|title=Ethnic Studies Coalition pushes for Ethnic Studies major at Wellesley {{!}} The Wellesley News|website=thewellesleynews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Taskforce for Asian and Pacific American Studies at [[Harvard University]], and CRAASH at [[Hunter College]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/university-students-alumni-fight-increase-asian-american-studies-n589246|title=University Students, Alumni Fight for Growth in Asian American Studies|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; are among student organizations calling for increased institutional support for Ethnic Studies. Ethnic studies as an institutional discipline varies by location. For instance, whereas the Ethnic Studies Department at [[UC Berkeley]] comprises separate "core group" departments, the department at [[UC San Diego]] does not do so.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20050319222738/http://www.columbiaspectator.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2005/02/09/4209bd8f7f02c]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools of thought==
While early ethnic studies scholarship focused on the repressed histories and identities of various groups in the U.S., the field of study has expanded to encompass transnationalism, comparative race Studies, and postmodernist/poststructuralist critiques. While pioneering thinkers relied on frameworks, theories and methodologies such as those found in the allied fields of sociology, history, literature and film, scholars in the field today utilize multidisciplinary as well as comparative perspectives, increasingly within an international or transnational context. Central to much Ethnic Studies scholarship is understanding how race, class, gender, sexuality, ability, and other categories of difference intersect to shape the lived experiences of people of color, what the legal scholar [[Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw|Kimberle Crenshaw]] calls intersectionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1229039|title=Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color|first=Kimberle|last=Crenshaw|date=January 1, 1991|publisher=|journal=Stanford Law Review|volume=43|issue=6|pages=1241–1299|doi=10.2307/1229039}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most recently, "whiteness" studies has been included as a popular site of inquiry in what is a traditionally academic field for studying the racial formation of communities of color. Instead of including whites as another additive component to ethnic studies, [[whiteness studies]] has instead focused on how the political and juridical category of white has been constructed and protected in relation to racial "others" and how it continues to shape the relationship between bodies of color and the State. As Ian Haney-Lopez articulates in ''White By Law: The Legal Construction of Race'', the law has functioned as the vehicle through which certain racialized groups have been included or excluded from the category of whiteness across time, and thus marked as inside or outside the national imaginary (read as white) and the privileges that result from this belonging.&lt;ref&gt;''White By Law: The Legal Construction of Race''&lt;/ref&gt; Important to whiteness studies, according to scholars such as Richard Dyer, is understanding how white bodies are both invisible and hypervisible, and how representations of whiteness in visual culture reflect and, in turn, shape a persistent commitment to white supremacy in the U.S. even as some claim the nation is currently a colorblind meritocracy.&lt;ref&gt;''White''&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to visual culture, space also reproduces and normalizes whiteness. The sociologist George Lipsitz argues that whiteness is a condition rather than a skin color, a structured advantage of accumulated privilege that resurfaces across time spatially and obscures the racism that continues to mark certain bodies as out of place and responsible for their own disadvantage.&lt;ref name="Lipsitz (2011)"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lipsitz |first=George |title=How Racism Takes Place |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-43990-256-1 |pages=320 |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lv0musrlBGYC |accessdate=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such attention to geography is an example of the way ethnic studies scholars have taken up the study of race and ethnicity across almost all disciplines using various methodologies in the humanities and social sciences.

In general, an "Ethnic Studies approach" is loosely defined as any approach that emphasizes the cross-relational and intersectional study of different groups. George Lipsitz again is important here, in demonstrating how the project of anti-black racism defines the relationship between the white spatial imaginary and other communities of color. Thus the [[redlining]] of the 1930s that prevented upwardly mobile African Americans from moving into all-white neighborhoods also forced Latino and Asian bodies into certain spaces.

==Relationship to other fields==

Ethnic studies exists in dialogue—and occasional tension—with a variety of related fields and disciplines.

In the case of traditional disciplines, ethnic studies often confronts resistance if not outright hostility to its mission. With many departments clinging to the ideal of objective and detached scholarship, the field is generally seen as a more politicized (and therefore, for some, a more troubling) form of academic inquiry. This hostility reflects, in some cases, a disinterest in the diversification of subject areas and the preservation of historically prominent fields. In the case of interdisciplinary fields, as ethnic studies has moved from a study of specific racial and ethnic groups towards the scrutiny of power dynamics, it has grown closer to fields like African American studies, Asian American studies, Native American studies, Latin@ studies, and American studies. Even more recently, ethnic studies has grown philosophically and politically closer to LGTBQ studies.

"Ethnic Studies" is often housed within departments or units with many different names. Teaching units often have a range of different names—Critical Ethnic Studies,&lt;ref name="las.depaul.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://las.depaul.edu/departments/critical-ethnic-studies/Pages/default.aspx|title=Critical Ethnic Studies  -  Academics  -  DePaul University College of LAS|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226101614/http://las.depaul.edu/departments/critical-ethnic-studies/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=December 26, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative American Cultures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://admission.wsu.edu/academics/fos/Public/field.castle?id=7584|title=Comparative Ethnic Studies - FOS - Admissions - WSU|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic Studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethnicstudies.berkeley.edu/ethnicstudies.php|title=Comparative Ethnic Studies Program - Ethnic Studies Department - UC Berkeley|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or American Studies and Ethnicity&lt;ref&gt;http://dornsife.usc.edu/ase/&lt;/ref&gt;—for curricula and faculty who are gathered together under the same set of academic interests. A wide variety of curricula are employed in the service of each of these rubrics. Occasionally, the gap between American Studies and Ethnic Studies can be productively bridged, especially in departments where the bulk of faculty focus on race and ethnicity, difference and power. But that bridgework can be troublesome, obscuring one foci and sharpening the emphasis on another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/49761|title=American Indians, American Studies, and the ASA|first=Philip Joseph|last=Deloria|date=January 1, 2003|publisher=|volume=55|issue=4|pages=669–680|accessdate=June 14, 2016|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.1353/aq.2003.0034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of this great variation, though, ethnic studies needs to be understood within its specific institutional context. And, despite considerable financial (and often political) pressure to consolidate or eliminate ethnic studies within American Studies—or to house Native American studies, Latin@ studies, and Asian American studies within either ethnic studies or American Studies—the relationships between these fields should be considered within each institution's governing eco-system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://capitalcityhues.com/041714EthnicStudiesUW.html|title=The Capital City Hues/041714/The Future of UW-Ethnic Studies|first=Jonathan|last=Gramling|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional associations==

===National Association for Ethnic Studies (NAES)===

The [http://ethnicstudies.org National Association for Ethnic Studies] was founded in 1972 by several scholars who wanted to study race through an interdisciplinary approach. It was initially named the National Association of Interdisciplinary Studies for Native-American, Black, Chicano, Puerto Rican, and Asian Americans. The organization was officially renamed in 1985.&lt;ref name="ethnicstudies.org"&gt;http://ethnicstudies.org/about/naes-history&lt;/ref&gt; It is the oldest ethnic studies association in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://ethnicstudies.org&lt;/ref&gt;

From its founding, the organization has strived to promote scholarship, research, and curriculum design for its members.&lt;ref name="ethnicstudies.org"/&gt; The organization hosts an annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;http://ethnicstudies.org/things-to-do-in-the-area&lt;/ref&gt;

NAES also publishes the Ethnic Studies Review, a peer-reviewed journal for scholarship in ethnic studies.&lt;ref&gt;http://ethnicstudies.org/publications/review&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical Ethnic Studies Association (CESA)===

The Critical Ethnic Studies Association began with its first conference in March 2011 at the University of California Riverside, Critical Ethnic Studies and the Future of Genocide: [[Settler colonialism]]/[[Heteropatriarchy]]/[[White Supremacy]]. This prompted the people who had organized and partaken in the conference to form the association. The second conference then took place in September 2013 at the University of Illinois Chicago and it was themed, Decolonizing Future Intellectual Legacies and Activist Practices. The third conference took place from April 30-May 2015 at York University in Toronto and it is titled, Sovereignties and Colonialisms: Resisting Racism, Extraction and Dispossession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criticalethnicstudies.org/content/conference-information|title=CONFERENCE INFORMATION  - criticalethnicstudies.org|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530163243/https://www.criticalethnicstudies.org/content/conference-information|archivedate=May 30, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some instances, ethnic studies has become entrapped within and similar to the mandates of liberal [[multiculturalism]], which relies on politics beholden to US nation-building and capitalist imperatives. Ethnic studies is in a difficult position, because as it gets more legitimizes within the academy, it has frequently done so by distancing itself from the very social movements that were the triggers for its creation. On the other hand, ethnic studies departments have always existed on the margins of the academic industrial complex, and become further marginalized through funding cuts due to the 2008 global economic crisis. Instead of just dismissing or wholly embracing identitarian nationalism, CESA seeks to construct an open dialogue around issues like white supremacy, settler colonialism, capitalism, and [[heteropatriarchy]], militarism, occupation, indigenous erasure, [[neocolonialism]], anti-immigration anti-Islam, etc. in order to expand the parameters and capacities of ethnic studies.

CESA's goal is not to romanticize all movements or dictate a specific relationship between scholars and activists. Instead, it questions the emphasis of professionalization within ethnic studies, the politics of the academic industrial complex, or the engagement of larger movements for social transformation. It recognizes that at times Ethnic Studies has been complicit in neutralizing the university, rather than questioning the university's ideologies actions, knowledge, and power. It works to situate the university as a point of contention, as a location among many for political struggles. CESA invites participation from all types of people: scholars, students, activists, arts, media makers, and educators of all fields, generations, and disciplines. The Critical Ethnic Studies Association was founded as a transnational, interdisciplinary, and un-disciplinary association of scholars, activists, students, artists, media makers, educators, and others who are directly concerned with interrogating the limitations of ethnic studies in order to better engage the historical stakes of the field. It organizes projects and programs to reimagine ethnic studies and its future through new interventions, both scholarly and activist based. They aim to develop an approach to scholarship, institution building, and activism animated by the spirit of the decolonial, antiracist, and other global liberationist movements that enabled the creation of Ethnic Studies in the first place. It hopes that this approach will continue to inform its political and intellectual projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criticalethnicstudies.org/content/mission-vision|title=Mission &amp; Vision - criticalethnicstudies.org|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530163406/https://www.criticalethnicstudies.org/content/mission-vision|archivedate=May 30, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a huge emphasis on counteracting institutional marginalization, revisiting the ideas that prompted the creation of ethnic studies, and to create new conversations that challenge US hegemony in traditional ethnic studies. Their goals include establishing an interdisciplinary network of scholars and activists stimulating debate on critical ethnic studies, providing forums such as the biannual conference or dialogues thought seminars, social media, etc. There is also a focus on publishing a journal, ''Critical Ethnic Studies'', for new scholarships, and to facilitate dialogues that is critical and constructive between activist and academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criticalethnicstudies.org/content/history-goals|title=History &amp; Goals - criticalethnicstudies.org|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617094135/https://www.criticalethnicstudies.org/content/history-goals|archivedate=June 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In high schools==

===In California schools===
While ethnic studies courses have had a presence throughout high schools in Southwest states, there have been attacks on the discipline in the past couple of years, with the state of California never fully enforcing such courses in its high schools. However, students and educators of school districts across Southern California are pushing towards implementing ethnic studies courses into school requirements. The [[El Rancho Unified School District]] (ERUSD), which serves the area of Pico Rivera, became the first school district in California to require an ethnic studies class as part of its students' graduation requirement in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erusd.org/|title=El Rancho Unified School District|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnic studies resolution in ERUSD was both drafted and proposed by ERUSD's board President, Aurora Villon and Vice President, Jose Lara and was presented as an effort to "expose ... students to global perspectives and inclusion of diversity".&lt;ref name="whittierdailynews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whittierdailynews.com/social-affairs/20140711/el-rancho-unified-school-district-authorizes-historic-ethnic-studies-graduation-requirement|title=El Rancho Unified School District authorizes historic ethnic studies graduation requirement|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This graduation requirement for ERUSD high school students is expected to be fully implemented by the 2015–2016 academic school year.&lt;ref name="whittierdailynews.com"/&gt;

In a similar move, [[Los Angeles Unified School District]] (LAUSD) will also begin to require ethnic studies courses in its high schools and will include such courses in its A-G graduation requirements. In November 2014, the LAUSD board approved a resolution proposed by board members Bennett Kayser, George McKenna and Steve Zimmer.&lt;ref name="laschoolreport.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laschoolreport.com/lausd-board-votes-to-add-ethnic-studies-to-schools-curriculum/|title=LAUSD board votes to add Ethnic Studies to schools' curriculum|date=November 19, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnic studies curriculum will begin as a pilot program in at least five high schools.&lt;ref name="laschoolreport.com"/&gt; It is expected that by the 2017–2018 academic school year, every high school will offer at least one course in ethnic studies and the class would be compulsory by the time the class of 2019 graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-ethnic-studies-20141209-story.html|title=L.A. Unified to require ethnic studies for high school graduation|first=Los Angeles|last=Times|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While LAUSD board members proposed the resolution, many students took on the efforts by creating petitions and rallies in support of the ethnic studies resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnicstudiesnow.com/nov_23_bennett_kayser_fundraiser|title=Sunday (Nov 23) Bennett Kayser Fundraiser (EAGLE ROCK)|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnicstudiesnow.com/lausd_rally_nov18|title=Nov 18 Rally &amp; Press Conference|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In New York schools===

The New York State government has implemented the Dignity for All Students Act (DASA) which requires administrative, supervisory, and student service personnel to be trained in "Harassment, Bullying, Cyber bullying, and Discrimination in Schools: Prevention and Intervention".&lt;ref name="archive.advocate.nyc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.advocate.nyc.gov/bullying/DASA|title=About the Dignity for All Students Act|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, ethnic studies is framed through the lens of "bullying" as an challenge for minority students to get the most out of their education in a safe classroom environment. For the creators of DASA, bullying has the potential to disrupt a student's bodily and emotional safety.

DASA aims to do the following:&lt;ref name="archive.advocate.nyc.gov"/&gt;

*DASA is designed to protect public schools students from bullying by employees or other students based on actual or perceived race, color, weight, national origin, ethnic group, religion, religious practice, disability, sexual orientation, gender, or sex.
*DASA requires schools and districts to revise codes of conduct to prohibit bullying and promote a bully-free environment, and to include age-appropriate versions of the policy in codes of conduct. School districts will be required to post codes of conduct on their websites by July 1, 2013.
*DASA requires K-12 schools to incorporate curriculum that promotes awareness of and sensitivity to discrimination and diversity as part of civility and citizenship classes.
*DASA requires every school to nominate a Dignity Act Coordinator that will be responsible for handling incidents of bullying.
*DASA requires schools to collect and report data on bullying to the New York State education commissioner at least once a year.
*DASA prohibits retaliation against anyone who reports incidents of bullying.
*DASA holds the State education commissioner responsible for helping school districts develop effective responses to bullying that are focused on solutions, intervention and education.

==Political attacks==
Ethnic studies has always been opposed by different elements. Proponents of ethnic studies feel that this is a reactionary movement from the right. They note the rise of the conservative movement during the 1990s in the United States, in which the discipline came increasingly under attack. For proponents, the backlash is an attempt to preserve "traditional values" of Western culture, symbolized by the United States. For some critics, this  is a slant by proponents to disparage criticism by false association to right wing ideology. They have no objection about African, Latino or Native American culture being legitimate topics of academic research.  What they object to is the current state of ethnic studies which they see as characterized by excessive left wing political ideology, [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] [[relativism]] which, in their view, greatly undermined the scholarly validity of the research. However, ethnic studies is accused of promoting "racial separatism", "linguistic isolation" and "racial preference".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acri.org/newsletter/june19993.htm acri.org/newsletter/june19993.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041223161232/http://www.acri.org/newsletter/june19993.htm |date=December 23, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Ward Churchill]], a professor of ethnic studies at [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], came under severe fire for an essay he wrote called "[[On the Justice of Roosting Chickens]]", in which he claimed that the [[September 11 attacks]] were a natural and unavoidable consequence of what he views as unlawful US policy, and referred to the "technocratic corps" working in the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] as "[[little Eichmanns]]".&lt;ref name="college-journalist-touched-off-firestorm"&gt;{{cite news | title = College journalist touched off firestorm | author = Charlie Brennan | work = Rocky Mountain News | date = February 3, 2005 | url = http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2005/feb/03/college-journalist-touched-off-firestorm/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative commentators used the Churchill affair to attack ethnic studies departments as enclaves of "anti-Americanism" which promote the idea of ethnic groups as "victims" in US society, and not places where serious scholarship is done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldblatt |first=Mark |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/goldblatt200502090753.asp |title=nationalreview.com/comment/goldblatt200502090753.asp |publisher=Nationalreview.com |date=February 9, 2005 |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of such attacks, ethnic studies scholars are now faced with having to defend the field. In the media, this takes form of characterising the attack as right wing reactionary movement. For example, Orin Starn, a cultural anthropologist and specialist in Native American Studies at [[Duke University]], says: "The United States is a very diverse country, and an advocate would say we teach kids to understand multiculturalism and diversity, and these are tools that can be used in law, government, business and teaching, which are fields graduates go into. It promotes thinking about diversity, globalization, how we do business and how we work with nonprofits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.denverpost.com/Stories/0,1413,36~53~2722200,00.html |title=denverpost.com/Stories/0,1413,36~53~2722200,00.html |work=Denver Post |accessdate=October 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515114123/http://www.denverpost.com/Stories/0%2C1413%2C36~53~2722200%2C00.html |archivedate=May 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to criticisms that ethnic studies academics undermine the study of a unified American history and culture or that ethnic studies are simply a "colored" version of American Studies, defenders point out that ethnic studies come out of the historically repressed and denied presence of groups within the U.S. knowledge-production, literature and epistemology. Efforts to merge ethnic studies with American studies have been met with fierce opposition as was the case at UC Berkeley. While the field is already decades old, the ongoing creation of new ethnic studies departments is fraught with controversy. Administrators at Columbia University attempted to placate student protests for the creation of an Ethnic Studies Department in 1996 by offering American Studies as a compromise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E2D81E39F93AA25757C0A960958260 |title=nytimes.com |work=New York Times |date=April 19, 1996 |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arizona ban==

On May 11, 2010, Arizona Governor [[Jan Brewer]] signed House Bill 2281 (also known as HB 2281 and A.R.S. §15–112), which prohibits a school district or charter school from including in its program of instruction any courses or classes that
#Promotes the overthrow of the Federal or state government or the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]
#Promotes resentment toward any race or class (e.g. racism and classism)
#Advocates ethnic solidarity instead of being individuals
#Are designed for a certain ethnicity
But the law must still allow:
#Native American classes to comply with federal law
#Grouping of classes based on academic performance
#Classes about the history of an ethnic group open to all students
#Classes discussing controversial history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/hb2281s.pdf |title=Arizona House Bill 2281 (2010) |format=PDF |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming off the heels of SB 1070, [[Superintendent of Public Instruction]] Tom Horne was adamant about cutting [[Mexican-American Studies]] in the [[Tucson Unified School District]].  He devised HB 2281 under the belief that the program was teaching "destructive ethnic chauvinism and that Mexican American students are oppressed".&lt;ref&gt;Tom Horne, [http://nau.edu/uploadedFiles/Academic/CAL/Philosophy/Forms/An%20Open%20Letter%20to%20Citizens%20of%20Tucson.pdf "An Open Letter to Citizens of Tucson"], June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2011, Horne reported TUSD to be out of compliance with the law.  In June of that year, the Arizona Education Department paid $110,000 to perform an audit on the [[Mexican American Studies Department Programs, Tucson Unified School District|TUSD's program]], which reported "no observable evidence was present to suggest that any classroom within the [[Tucson Unified School District]] is in direct violation of the law." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/news/election/azelections/articles/2011/06/16/20110616tucson-ethnic-studies-audit0616.html "Tucson ethnic-studies program not illegal, audit says"] The Arizona Republic, June 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Huppenthal]] (elected Superintendent as Horne became [[Attorney General]]) ordered the audit as part of his campaign promise to "Stop La Raza", but when the audit contradicted his own personal findings of noncompliance, he discredited it.  Despite a formal appeal issued on June 22, 2011 by TUSD to Huppenthal, Judge Lewis Kowal backed the Superintendent's decision and ruled the district out of compliance in December, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Billeaud|first=Jacques|title=Ariz schools' ethnic studies program ruled illegal|url=https://news.yahoo.com/ariz-schools-ethnic-studies-program-ruled-illegal-021635252.html|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=December 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 10, 2012 the TUSD board voted to cut the program after Huppenthal threatened to withhold 10% of the district's annual funding.  Numerous books related to the [[Mexican-American Studies]] program were found in violation of the law and have been stored in district storehouses, including Shakespeare's ''[[The Tempest]]'', [[Paolo Freire]]'s ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]'', and Bill Bigelow's ''"Rethinking Columbus: The Next 500 Years''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2012/01/13/whos_afraid_of_the_tempest/ "Who's afraid of 'The Tempest'?"] Salon, January 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of MAS see HB 2281 as another attack on the Hispanic population of Arizona.  This is due partly to the fact that none of the other three ethnic studies programs were cut. Support for the ethnic studies programs subsequently came from scholars, community activist groups, etc. For example, The Curriculum Audit of the Mexican American Studies Department refuted all of the violations under House Bill 2281. The audit instead recommended that the courses be implemented further, given the positive impacts of the courses on the students. In addition to the defense of the ethnic studies department, the UN Charter of Human Rights challenges the bill as a violation of fundamental human, constitutional, and educational rights (Kunnie 2010). A 2011 documentary, [[Precious Knowledge]] directed by Ari Palos and produced by Eren McGinnis for Dos Vatos Productions, argues that while 48% of Hispanic students drop out, TUSD's program had become a model of national success, with 93% of enrolled students graduating and 85% going on to college.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dosvatos.com/films/PreciousKnowledge/more.php "Precious Knowledge"] Dos Vatos Films, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The film shows a 165-mile community run from Tucson to Phoenix in protest of the state's decision, as well as student-led marches and stand-ins. 
In one instance, students overtook a board meeting by chaining themselves to the board members' chairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myfoxphoenix.com/dpp/news/education/students-protest-ethnic-studies-curriculum-change-4-26-11 "Students Protest Ethnic Studies Curriculum Change"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821045758/http://www.myfoxphoenix.com/dpp/news/education/students-protest-ethnic-studies-curriculum-change-4-26-11 |date=August 21, 2011 }} MyFoxPhoenix.com, April 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  A student protest group, UNIDOS (United Non-Discriminatory Individuals Demanding Our Studies), has remained active speaking out before legislators and school board members on behalf of the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tucson12.nytimes-institute.com/12/tucson-school-board-eliminates-mexican-american-studies-program/ "Tucson School Board Eliminates Mexican American Studies Program"] New York Times Student Journalism Institute, January 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate case, two students and 11 teachers sued the state, contending that the law is unconstitutional.  The teachers, however, have been denied standing in the lawsuit as public employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/01/11/42963.htm "Students, Not Teachers, Can Fight Ban on Ethnic Studies"] Courthouse News Service, January 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Appeal of Arizona Ban ===
The Mexican American Studies course was first brought under attack after the Deputy Superintendent of Public Education gave a speech to students, countering an allegation that "Republicans  hate Latinos."&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2015/07/07/13-15657.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The students walked out of the speech, and Tom Horne, the Superintendent, blamed the rudeness of the students on the teachers from their Mexican American Studies courses. He called for removal of the courses. When his call was not answered, he made an effort for a bill to be put into law banning Mexican American Studies courses.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;

House Bill 2281,&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/hb2281s.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which prohibited the Mexican American Studies courses, was approved in December 2010. In an effort to enforce the bill, the district court gave the Superintendent of the school district the right to withhold funding to schools that continue to teach the ethnic studies course.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2011/12/27/judge-upholds-ethnic-studies-decision-orders-money-withheld-from-tusd/|title=Judge upholds ethnic studies decision, orders money withheld from TUSD – Arizona Capitol Times|last=Grado|first=Gary|date=2011-12-27|website=azcapitoltimes.com|publisher=Arizona Capital Times|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Kowal ruled the course “biased, political, and emotionally charged,” and upheld both the bill and the withholding of funding from schools.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

An appeal was filed in October 2010.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; The initial appeal was challenging House Bill 2281&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; for violation of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] (for viewpoint discrimination) and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] (for void-for-vagueness) rights.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; This initial appeal was filed by 10 teachers, the director of the Mexican American Studies program, and 3 students and their parents.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; Once the students graduated, 2 dropped their appeals, and the teachers and program director were dismissed for want of standing in January 2012.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; This left one student and her father on the appeal.

In March 2013, the appeals court ruled only in favor of the plaintiffs on the grounds that there was a First Amendment overbreadth violation to House Bill 2281.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; The plaintiffs decided to further appeal the case.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;

On July 7, 2015, the appeal on the ban of the Mexican American Studies, "''Maya Arce vs Huppenthal''", reached a federal appeals court.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tonydiaz/discrimination-is-the-onl_b_7783704.html|title=Arizona Gets Schooled: Update on Ban of Mexican American Studies|last=Diaz|first=Tony|date=2015-08-11|website=The Huffington Post|publisher=Huffington Post|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overseen by Judge Rakoff, the court reversed part of what the district court had ruled on banning the course. Judge Rakoff looked at the 4 categories (listed above) that constitute which classes are prohibited.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

Rakoff's statement said that House Bill 2281 was created with the Mexican American Studies course in mind.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; Since the Mexican American studies course was the only course in Arizona to be banned, it became clear that the bill had targeted the one course. This led the court to find the bill to be partially unconstitutional as it did not require similar Mexican American Studies courses outside of the Tucson Unified School District to cease teaching the courses. The bill also did not ban African American Studies courses that were being taught.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

Rakoff's final ruling affirmed part of the bill to be unconstitutional regarding the plaintiff's First Amendment right.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; However, Rakoff upheld the district court's ruling that the bill is not overbroad.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; Rakoff sent part of the appeal back to the district court to review the claim that the bill is discriminatory.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

In August 2017, a different federal judge found that the bill was motivated by discriminatory intent, and struck down the ban on ethnic studies as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Depenbrock|first1=Julie|title=Federal Judge Finds Racism Behind Arizona Law Banning Ethnic Studies|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/08/22/545402866/federal-judge-finds-racism-behind-arizona-law-banning-ethnic-studies|website=NPR.org|publisher=NPR|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge felt that the ban had been passed "not for a legitimate educational purpose, but for an invidious discriminatory racial purpose and a politically partisan purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/arizona-cant-ban-mexican-american-studies-anymore-judge-says_us_5a442f28e4b025f99e199496|title=Arizona Can't Ban Mexican-American Studies Anymore, Judge Says|last=Planas|first=Roque|date=2017-12-28|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

In [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]], the term '''excarnation''' (also known as '''defleshing''') refers to the practice of removing the flesh and organs of [[cadaver|the dead]] before burial, leaving only the bones.

Excarnation may be precipitated through natural means, involving leaving a body exposed for animals to scavenge, or it may be purposefully undertaken by butchering the corpse by hand.

==Platform burial==
Practices making use of natural processes for excarnation are the [[Tibetan sky burial]], [[Comanche]] platform burials, and traditional [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] funerals (see [[Tower of Silence]]).

Archaeologists believe that in this practice, people typically left the body exposed on a woven litter or altar. When the excarnation was complete, the litter with its remains would be removed from the site. Since [[metatarsals]], finger bones and toe bones are very small, they would easily fall through gaps in the woven structure or roll off the side during this removal. Thus, a site in which only small bones are found is suggestive of ritual excarnation.

Some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] groups in the southeastern portion of [[North America]] practised deliberate excarnation in [[Protohistory|protohistoric]] times.

There have been numerous solar concentrators installed in Mumbai to incinerate the body as an alternative way to naturally break it down to bare bones in just 3 days. These practices are changing due to a shortage of vultures in India, and has caused the practice to evolve in order to still serve the same purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Markandya|first=Anil|last2=Taylor|first2=Tim|last3=Longo|first3=Alberto|last4=Murty|first4=M.N.|last5=Murty|first5=S.|last6=Dhavala|first6=K.|title=Counting the cost of vulture decline—An appraisal of the human health and other benefits of vultures in India|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S092180090800178X|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=67|issue=2|pages=194–204|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2008.04.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other methods==
From the pattern of marks on some human bones at prehistoric sites, researchers have inferred that members of the community removed the flesh from the bones as part of its burial practices.

Neolithic farmers living in [[Tavoliere delle Puglie|Tavoliere, Italy]] over 7000 years ago practiced ritual defleshing of the dead. Light cut marks on the bones suggest the bones were defleshed up to a year after death. The bones were deposited in Scaloria Cave, and when excavated were mixed with animal bones, broken pottery and stone tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/archaeology/2015/03/stone-age-italians-defleshed-their-dead |title=Stone-age Italians defleshed their dead |last1=Shaw |first1=Garry |last2= |first2= |date=27 March 2015 |website=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] |access-date=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Ages, excarnation was practised by European cultures as a way to preserve the bones when the deceased was of high status or had died some distance from home. One notable example of a person who underwent excarnation following death was [[Christopher Columbus]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}.  The American Revolutionary War general, [[Anthony Wayne]], also underwent a form of excarnation.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh T. Harrington and Lisa A. Ennis. "Mad" Anthony Wayne: His Body Did Not Rest in Peace. http://www.americanrevolution.org/wayne.html, citing History of Erie County, Pennsylvania, vol. 1. pp. 211–2. Warner, Beers &amp; Co., Chicago. 1884.&lt;/ref&gt; A practice known as mos teutonicus, or active excarnation, was a German custom. The bodies were broken down differently than solely defleshing, they were cut up and subsequently boiled in either wine, water, or vinegar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60742129|title=Interacting with the dead : perspectives on mortuary archaeology for the new millennium|date=2005|publisher=University Press of Florida|others=Rakita, Gordon F. M., 1971-|isbn=0813028566|location=Gainesville|oclc=60742129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[Japan]], where [[cremation]] is predominant, it is common for close relatives of the deceased to transfer, using special chopsticks, the remaining bones from the ashes to a special jar in which they will be interred. However, in ancient Japanese society, prior to the introduction of [[Buddhism]] and the funerary practice of cremation, the corpse was exposed in a manner very similar to the [[Tibetan sky burial]]. See ''[[Japanese funeral]].''

Pre-contact Hawaiians ritually defleshed the bones of high-ranking nobles (ali'i) so that they could be interred in reliquaries for later veneration. The remains of [[James Cook|Captain Cook]], who the Hawaiians had believed to be the god [[Lono]], were treated this way after his death. The [[Moriori people|Moriori]] of the [[Chatham Islands]] (now part of New Zealand) placed their dead in a sitting position in the sand dunes looking out to sea; others were strapped to young trees in the forest. In time, the tree grew into and through the bones, making them one.

Following the excarnation process, many societies retrieved the bones for burial.

==Defleshing during the Middle Ages==
During the Middle Ages in Europe, defleshing was a mortuary procedure used mainly to prepare human remains for transport over long distances. The practice was used only for nobility. It involved removing skin, muscles, and organs from a body, leaving only the bones.
In this procedure, the head, arms, and legs were detached from the body. The process left telltale cuts on the bones.

King Saint [[Louis IX of France]] is said to have been defleshed by boiling his corpse until the flesh separated from the bones. This was intended to preserve his bones, to avoid decaying of the remains during their return to France from the [[Eighth Crusade]], and to provide relics. The process is known as [[mos Teutonicus]].&lt;ref name=Westerhof&gt;{{cite book |last=Westerhof |first=Danielle |editor-first=|editor-last=|title=Death and the Noble Body in Medieval England |publisher= Boydell Press |date=October 16, 2008 |pages= |chapter= |isbn= 1843834162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinguishing excarnation from cannibalism==
Archaeologists seeking to study the practice of ritual excarnation in the archeological record must differentiate between the removal of flesh as a burial practice, and as a precursor to [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wnjBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22An+Archaeology+of+Desperation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI2Pagur_bAhVB0YMKHWrOARIQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22An%20Archaeology%20of%20Desperation&amp;f=false|title=An Archaeology of Desperation: Exploring the Donner Party's Alder Creek Camp|last=Scott|first=G.

One common approach is to compare the tool marks and other cuts on the bones with butchered animal bones from the same site, with the assumption that cannibalized humans would have been prepared like any other meat, whereas excarnated bodies would be prepared differently. Cannibalized bones, in contrast to excarnated bones, may also exhibit telltale signs such as human tooth marks, broken long bones (to facilitate marrow extraction), and signs of cooking, such as "pot polishing".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/blog/criteria-for-cannibalism/|title=Beyond Stone and Bone    » Criteria for Cannibalism - Archaeology Magazine Archive|website=archive.archaeology.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7999">In [[molecular biology]], '''[[exon]] skipping''' is a form of [[RNA splicing]] used to cause cells to “skip” over faulty or misaligned sections of genetic code, leading to a truncated but still functional protein despite the genetic mutation.

==Exon-skipping mechanism==
{{See also|RNA splicing}}
Exon skipping is used to restore the [[reading frame]] within a gene. [[Gene]]s are the genetic instructions for creating a protein, and are composed of [[intron]]s and [[exon]]s. Exons are the sections of DNA that contain the instruction set for generating a protein; they are interspersed with non-coding regions called introns. The introns are later removed before the protein is made, leaving only the coding exon regions.

Splicing naturally occurs in [[pre-mRNA]] when introns are being removed to form mature-mRNA that consists solely of exons. Starting in the late 1990s, scientists realized they could take advantage of this naturally occurring cellular splicing to downplay genetic [[mutations]] into less harmful ones.&lt;ref name = "wahl"&gt;Wahl, Margaret.

The mechanism behind exon skipping is a mutation specific [[antisense oligonucleotide]] (AON). An antisense oligonucleotide is a synthesized short nucleic acid polymer, typically fifty or fewer base pairs in length that will bind to the mutation site in the pre-messenger RNA, to induce exon skipping.&lt;ref name = "hard"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AON binds to the mutated exon, so that when the gene is then translated from the mature mRNA, it is “skipped” over, thus restoring the disrupted reading frame.&lt;ref name = "hard"/&gt; This allows for the generation of an internally deleted, but largely functional protein.

Some mutations require exon skipping at multiple sites, sometimes adjacent to one another, in order to restore the reading frame. Multiple exon skipping has successfully been carried out using a combination of AONs that target multiple exons.&lt;ref name = "aartsma1"&gt;{{Cite journal

==Exon skipping as a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)==

Exon skipping is being heavily researched for the treatment of [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]] (DMD), where the muscular protein [[dystrophin]] is prematurely truncated, which leads to a non-functioning protein. Successful treatment by way of exon skipping could lead to a mostly functional dystrophin protein, and create a phenotype similar to the less severe [[Becker muscular dystrophy]] (BMD).&lt;ref name = "wahl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="what"&gt;[http://www.muscular-dystrophy.org/about_muscular_dystrophy/research_faqs/612_what_is_exon_skipping_and_how_does_it_work What Is Exon Skipping and How Does It Work?] Muscular Dystrophy Campaign. N.p., 11 July 2009. Web. 05 Nov. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the protein that becomes compromised is dystrophin.&lt;ref name="what"/&gt;  The dystrophin protein has two essential functional domains that flank a central rod domain consisting of repetitive and partially dispensable segments.&lt;ref name = "aartsma"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=1986821|year=2007|author1=Aartsma-Rus|first1=A|title=Antisense-mediated exon skipping: A versatile tool with therapeutic and research applications|journal=RNA|volume=13|issue=10|pages=1609–1624|last2=Van Ommen|first2=G. J.|doi=10.1261/rna.653607|pmid=17684229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dystrophin’s function is to maintain muscle fiber stability during contraction by linking the extra cellular matrix to the cytoskeleton. Mutations that disrupt the [[open reading frame]] within dystrophin create prematurely truncated proteins that are unable to perform their job. Such mutations lead to muscle fiber damage, replacement of muscle tissue by fat and fibrotic tissue, and premature death typically occurring in the early twenties of DMD patients.&lt;ref name = "aartsma"/&gt; Comparatively, mutations that do not upset the open reading frame, lead to a dystrophin protein that is internally deleted and shorter than normal, but still partially functional. Such mutations are associated with the much milder Becker muscular dystrophy. Mildly affected BMD patients carrying deletions that involve over two thirds of the central rod domain have been described, suggesting that this domain is largely dispensable.

Dystrophin can maintain a large degree of functionality so long as the essential terminal domains are unaffected, and exon skipping only occurs within the central rod domain. Given these parameters, exon skipping can be used to restore an open reading frame by inducing a deletion of one or several exons within the central rod domain, and thus converting a DMD phenotype into a BMD phenotype.	

The genetic mutation that leads to Becker muscular dystrophy is an [[in-frame deletion]]. This means that, out of the 79 exons that code for dystrophin, one or several in the middle may be removed, without affecting the exons that follow the deletion. This allows for a shorter-than-normal dystrophin protein that maintains a degree of functionality. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the genetic mutation is out-of-frame. Out-of-frame mutations cause a premature stop in protein generation - the ribosome is unable to “read” the RNA past the point of initial error - leading to a severely shortened and completely non-functional dystrophin protein.&lt;ref name = "aartsma" /&gt;

The goal of exon skipping is to manipulate the splicing pattern so that an out-of-frame mutation becomes an in-frame mutation, thus changing a severe DMD mutation into a less harmful in-frame BMD mutation.

Genetic testing, usually from blood samples, can be used to determine the precise nature and location of the DMD mutation in the dystrophin gene. It is known that these mutations cluster in areas known as the 'hot spot' regions — primarily in exons 45–53 and to a lesser extent exons 2–20.&lt;ref name = "aartsma1"/&gt; As the majority of DMD mutations occur in these 'hot spot' regions, a treatment which causes these exons to be skipped could be used to treat up to 50% of DMD patients.&lt;ref name = "aartsma1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="what"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=14526374|year=2003|author1=Van Deutekom|first1=J.

'''Social work''' has its roots in the attempts of [[society]] at large to deal with the problem of poverty and inequality. Social work is intricately linked with the idea of [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] work; but must be understood in broader terms. The concept of charity goes back to ancient times, and the practice of providing for the poor has roots in all [[Major religious groups|major world religions]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalenvision.org/forteachers/28/1258/ |title=Religion |accessdate=2008-04-09 |work=Middle School Lesson Plans |publisher=Global Envision}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-modern antecedents==
Even before the rise of modern European states, the church was providing social services. When [[Constantine I]] legalized the [[Christian Church]] in the 4th century, the newly legitimised church set up burial societies, [[poorhouse]]s, homes for the aged, shelter for the homeless, hospitals, and [[orphanage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Clarence Flick|year=1919|title=The Rise of the Mediaeval Church and Its Influence on the Civilisation of Western Europe from the First to the Thirteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ApLaUMO0ZycC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ishm2006.hu/scientific/abstract.php?ID=138G. Kalantzis (2006). The Historical Evolution of Social Medicine in Byzantium (330-1453 AD)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=4A665169DCB94F67A7CF47ECC60F22C0.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=1316632 C. Gilleard (2007) Ageing &amp; Society — Old age in Byzantine society] (2007), 27: 623-642, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These were often funded, at least in part, from grants from the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Burckhardt, Jacob |title = The Age of Constantine the Great| publisher = Random House (Vintage) | year = 1967 | isbn = 0-520-04680-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 580 AD the church had a system for circulating consumables to the poor: associated with each [[parish]] was a ''diaconium'' or office of the [[deacon]].&lt;!---probably well before 590 like maybe in the 1st century.---&gt; Monasteries also often served as comprehensive social service agencies, acting as hospitals, homes for the aged, orphanages,  travelers' aid stations.

During the [[Middle Ages]], the Christian church had vast influence on European society and charity was considered to be a responsibility and a sign of one’s piety. This charity was in the form of direct relief (for example, giving money, food, or other material goods to alleviate a particular need), as opposed to trying to change the root causes of poverty. As there was no effective bureaucracy below city government that was capable of large scale charitable activities, the clergy carried out this role until the [[Early Modern Period]].

==Modern development==
It was not until the emergence of [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]] that the informal helping systems of the church and family began to be replaced by social welfare services.

The practice and profession of social work has a relatively modern and scientific origin,&lt;ref name="BoiseStateI"&gt;{{cite web|last = Huff |first = Dan |title = Chapter I. Scientific Philanthropy (1860-1900) |work =[http://www.boisestate.edu/socwork/dhuff/history/central/core.htm The Social Work History Station] |publisher = [[Boise State University]] |url =http://www.boisestate.edu/socwork/dhuff/history/chapts/1-1.htm|accessdate = 2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is generally considered to have developed out of three strands. The first was individual casework, a strategy pioneered by the [[Charity Organisation Society]] in the mid-19th century. The
second was social administration, which included various forms of poverty relief. Statewide poverty relief could be said to have its roots in the English [[Poor Laws]] of the 17th century, but was first systematized through the efforts of the Charity Organisation Society. The third consisted of social action - rather than engaging in the resolution of immediate individual requirements, the emphasis was placed on political action working through the community and the group to improve their social conditions and thereby alleviate poverty. This approach was developed originally by the [[settlement house]] movement.&lt;ref name="Lymbery"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uk.sagepub.com/upm-data/9812_039472ch02.pdf|author=Lymbery|title=The History and Development of Social Work}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was accompanied by a less easily defined movement; the development of institutions to deal with the entire range of social problems. All had their most rapid growth during the nineteenth century, and laid the foundational basis for modern social work, both in theory and in practice.&lt;ref name="Popple, Philip R 2011"&gt;Popple, Philip R. and Leighninger, Leslie. Social Work, Social Welfare, American Society.Boston:Allyn&amp;Bacon,2011.Print&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional social work originated in 19th century England, and had its roots in the social and economic upheaval wrought by the [[Industrial Revolution]], in particular the societal struggle to deal with the resultant mass urban-based [[poverty]] and its related problems. Because poverty was the main focus of early social work, it was intricately linked with the idea of charity work.&lt;ref name="Popple, Philip R 2011"/&gt; (Today, it is common for social workers to find themselves dealing with consequences arising from other social problems such as racism, sexism, homophobia, and discrimination based on age or on physical or mental disability.)

With the decline of [[feudalism]] in 16th century England, the indigent poor came to be seen as a more direct threat to the social order.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socialworkdegreeguide.com/faq/what-is-the-history-of-the-social-work-profession&lt;/ref&gt; As they were often not associated to a particular feudal manor, the government moved towards the formation of an organized poverty relief system to care for them.

The origins of the [[English Poor Law]] system can be traced as far back as late medieval statutes dealing with beggars and vagrancy but it was only during the Tudor period that the Poor Law system became codified. [[Monasteries]], the primary source of poor relief, were dissolved by the Tudors [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] causing poor relief to move from a largely voluntary basis to a compulsory tax that was collected at a parish level.&lt;ref name="victorianweb2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/poorlaw/elizpl.html |title=The 1601 Elizabethan Poor Law |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2002-11-12 |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early legislation was concerned with [[vagrants]] and making the [[able-bodied]] work, especially while labour was in short supply following the [[Black Death]].

The first complete code of poor relief was made in the [[Act for the Relief of the Poor 1597]] and some provision for the "deserving poor" was eventually made in the [[Elizabethan Poor Law (1601)|Elizabethan Poor Law]] of 1601.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Higginbotham |url=http://workhouses.org/ |title=www.workhouses.org.uk |publisher=www.workhouses.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It created a system administered at parish level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyhome.co.uk/peel/poorlaw/plaa.htm |title=The Old Poor Law 1795–1834 |publisher=Historyhome.co.uk |date=2009-01-19 |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; paid for by levying local rates on rate payers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdlp.co.uk/resources/general/poor_law.htm |title=A Short Explanation of the English Poor Law |publisher=Mdlp.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relief for those too ill or old to work, the so-called '[[impotent poor]]', was in the form of a payment or items of food ('the parish loaf') or clothing also known as [[outdoor relief]]. Some aged people might be accommodated in parish [[alms house]]s, though these were usually private charitable institutions. Meanwhile, able-bodied beggars who had refused work were often placed in [[House of Correction|Houses of Correction]] or even subjected to beatings to mend their attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/poorlaw/elizpl.html |title=The 1601 Elizabethan Poor Law |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2002-11-12 |accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As populations grew in [[Colonial America]], [[almhouses]] were built to house vulnerable people with no other support, including people with a long term illness or older people without families.  The first recorded Almshouse was built in 1713 near [[Philadelphia]] by William Penn, and was only open to [[Quakers]]. A second one was built nearby in 1728, this time with public money. In 1736 New York opened the Poor House of the City of New York (later renamed [[Bellevue Hospital]]) and in 1737 [[New Orleans]] opened the Saint John's Hospital to serve the poor of the city.&lt;ref name=gehlert&gt;Gehlert, S. in Gehlert, S. and T.A.

Although the aim of the legislation was to reduce costs to rate payers, one area not reformed was the method of financing of the Poor Law system which continued to be paid for by levying a "poor rate"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/poorlaw/savings.html |title=Savings on the poor rates made by the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2002-09-17 |accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the property owning middle classes.

Conditions in workhouses were to be made harsh to discourage people from claiming. Workhouses were to be built in every parish and, if parishes were too small, parishes could group together to form [[Workhouse Unions]]. The [[Poor Law Commissioners]] were to be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Act.

===Private philanthropy===
[[File:Charity to Street Arab.jpg|150px|thumb|Social work involves ameliorating social problems such as poverty and homelessness.]]
The 19th century saw a great leap forward in technological and scientific achievement. There was also a great [[Urbanization|migration]] to urban areas throughout the [[Western world]], which led to many social problems. This galvanised the socially active, prosperous middle and upper classes to search for ways to ameliorate the physical and spiritual conditions of the poor underclasses.&lt;ref name="EDINBURGH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Work History |publisher=[[University of Edinburgh]] |url=http://www.socialwork.ed.ac.uk/social/history.html |accessdate=2008-02-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221085300/http://www.socialwork.ed.ac.uk/social/history.html |archivedate=2007-12-21 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was coupled with a religious revival, and many Protestant mission efforts (urban missions), attempted to resolve the problems inherent in large cities like poverty, prostitution, disease, and other afflictions. A new philosophy of "scientific charity" emerged, which stated charity should be "secular, rational and empirical as opposed to sectarian, sentimental, and dogmatic.&lt;ref name="BoiseStateII"&gt;{{cite web|last = Huff |first = Dan |title = Chapter I.2 Missionaries &amp; Volunteers |work =[http://www.boisestate.edu/socwork/dhuff/history/central/core.htm The Social Work History Station] |publisher = [[Boise State University]] |url =http://www.boisestate.edu/socwork/dhuff/history/chapts/1-2.htm|accessdate = 2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

During this time, rescue societies were initiated to find more appropriate means of self-support for women involved in prostitution.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} State-built [[Mental asylum]]s were built from the 1840s to assist in taking care of the [[mentally ill]].

Most historians identify the [[Charity Organization Society]], founded by [[Helen Bosanquet]] and [[Octavia Hill]] in London in 1869,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.family-action.org.uk/section.aspx?id=1155 |title=1800s |work=Family Action: About Us |accessdate=17 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718211919/http://www.family-action.org.uk/section.aspx?id=1155 |archivedate=18 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the pioneering organization of the social theory that led to the emergence of social work as a professional occupation.&lt;ref name="Lymbery" /&gt; COS had its main focus on individual casework. It supported the concept of self-help and limited government intervention to deal with the effects of poverty. The organisation claimed to use "scientific principles to root out scroungers and target relief where it was most needed".&lt;ref&gt;Rees, Rosemary (2001). ''Poverty and Public Health 1815-1949''. London: Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Octavia-Hill-by-Sargent.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|alt=portrait of a Victorian woman of middle age facing the artist, head slightly to the right|[[Octavia Hill]] pioneered many aspects of social work. Portrait by [[John Singer Sargent]], 1898]]
[[Alsager Hay Hill]] was prominent from its foundation, acting as honorary secretary of the council until July 1870, and as an active member of the council until 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|title=Hill, Alsager Hay (DNB12)|last=|first=|year=|publisher=|page=|wspage=|scan=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill also worked as an almoner to the Society for the Relief of Distress in the East of London. He campaigned about the many flaws in the [[poor laws]] and urged for a more scientific classification of paupers. His 1867 pamphlet, on ''Our Unemployed,'' was one of the earliest attempts to highlight the problem of systemic [[unemployment]];  he suggested a national system of labour registration. In 1871, Hill pioneered a system of [[labour exchange]]s in England, establishing 'The Employment Inquiry Office and Labour Registry,'. There, Hill advised applicants for assistance, and founded and edited ''Labour News'' to improve communication between masters and men seeking work.&lt;ref name=CNHistory&gt;{{cite news|title=History in the making|url=http://www.cnplus.co.uk/news/history-in-the-making/949883.article|accessdate=20 February 2015|work=Construction News|date=5 September 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Octavia Hill]] is regarded by many as the founder of modern social work. She was a moving force behind the development of social housing, and her early friendship with [[John Ruskin]] enabled her to put her theories into practice with the aid of his initial investment. She believed in self-reliance, and made it a key part of her housing system that she and her assistants knew their tenants personally and encouraged them to better themselves. She was opposed to municipal provision of housing, believing it to be bureaucratic and impersonal. Under her guidance, the Charity Organisation Society organised charitable grants and pioneered a home-visiting service that formed the basis for modern social work.

[[File:London-slum-1880s.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Victorian photograph of the exterior of a London slum property|A [[Marylebone]] slum in the nineteenth century.]]
She also provided housing for the poor; after being improved her properties were let to those on intermittent and low incomes. At the heart of the Octavia Hill system was the weekly visit to collect rent. From the outset, Hill conceived this as a job for women only. She and her assistants, including [[Emma Cons]] combined the weekly rent collection with checking every detail of the premises and getting to know the tenants personally, acting as early social workers.&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;Darley, Gillian, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/33873 "Hill, Octavia (1838–1912)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 1 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; At first Hill believed, "Voluntary workers are a necessity. They are better than paid workers, and can be had in sufficient numbers."&lt;ref name=mann&gt;Mann, Peter H., "Octavia Hill: An Appraisal", ''The Town Planning Review'', Vol. 23, No. 3 (October 1952), pp. 223–37&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she found it expedient to maintain a paid workforce.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

Hill's principles were summed up in an article of 1869: "Where a man persistently refuses to exert himself, external help is worse than useless." She was an outspoken critic of the principles of "[[outdoor relief]]" or the [[Speenhamland system]] of poor relief as operated by various Poor Law Boards. Because these systems did not encourage recipients to work, she regarded them as "a profligate use of public funds."&lt;ref name=wyatt2&gt;Wyatt, R.J. (2000). ''Octavia Hill and The Crown Estate – a Continuing Legacy?'', [[The Crown Estate]] p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Under her methods, personal responsibility was encouraged. She insisted on dealing with arrears promptly; she appointed reliable caretakers; she took up of references on prospective tenants, and visited them in their homes; she paid careful attention to allocations and the placing of tenants, with regard to size of families and the size and location of the accommodation to be offered; and she made no rules that could not be properly enforced.&lt;ref name=wyatt2/&gt;

===Social action===
[[File:Toynbee Hall 1902.jpg|thumb|[[Toynbee Hall]] settlement house, [[Whitechapel]] was founded in 1884 as part of the [[Settlement movement]]. Pictured here in 1902.]]
A stress on social action that developed in the 1880s, was pioneered by the [[Settlement house]] movement.&lt;ref name="BoiseStateIII"&gt;{{cite web|last = Huff |first = Dan |title = Chapter II. Settlements (1880-1900) |work =[http://www.boisestate.edu/socwork/dhuff/history/central/core.htm The Social Work History Station] |publisher = [[Boise State University]] |url =http://www.boisestate.edu/socwork/dhuff/history/chapts/2-1.htm|accessdate = 2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Movement (creating integrated mixed communities of rich and poor) grew directly out of Octavia Hill's work. Her colleagues [[Samuel Augustus Barnett|Samuel]] and [[Henrietta Barnett]], founded [[Toynbee Hall]], [[Oxford House (settlement)|Oxford House]]&lt;ref name="Danilov pp. 356-357" /&gt; in 1884 in Bethnal Green as the first university-sponsored settlement. Another early organization was Mansfield House Settlement, also in east London.

The settlement was named after [[Arnold Toynbee]], an economic historian who's intellectual work laid the foundations of the movement. Toynbee was actively involved in improving the living conditions of the [[labourer]]. He read for workers in large industrial centres and encouraged the creation of trade unions and [[co-operative]]s. A focal point of his commitment was the slum of [[Whitechapel]], in east London, where he helped to establish public libraries for the working class population. Toynbee also encouraged his students to offer free courses for working class audiences in their own neighbourhoods.

In America, the settlement movement was established by [[Jane Addams]], a young medical student, and [[Ellen Gates Starr]] after Addams visited Toynbee Hall and was impressed by the system. She founded [[Chicago]]'s [[Hull House]] in 1889, which focused on providing education and recreational facilities for European immigrant women and children.&lt;ref name="Danilov pp. 356-357"&gt;{{cite book|author=Victor J. Danilov|title=Famous Americans: A Directory of Museums, Historic Sites, and Memorials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kWsrAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA356|date=26 September 2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-9186-9|pages=356–357|chapter=Social Activists}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1913, there were 413 settlements in 32 states.&lt;ref&gt;Husock, H. (1993). "Bringing back the settlement house". ''Public Welfare'', 51(4).&lt;/ref&gt; The house was both a community service centre and a social research program.  Precursors to modern social work arose at Hull House as health professionals began to work with social determinants of poor health.&lt;ref name=gehlert/&gt; 

[[File:Bohemmian Youth East St. Louis.jpg|thumb|left|Bohemian immigrant youth at the [[Lessie Bates Davis Neighborhood House]] in 1918 in East St. Louis, Illinois.]]
The concept of the Settlement house movement was to bring upper and middle class students into lower-class neighbourhoods, not only to provide education and social aid, but to actually live and work together with their inhabitants. This soon inspired a worldwide movement of university settlements. The idea was to help members of the future elite understand the problems of wider society; this was especially important at a time when class divisions were much stronger, [[social mobility]] was minimal, and the living conditions of the poor were completely unknown to many members of the upper class.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Marshall, "[http://www.disei.unifi.it/upload/sub/pubblicazioni/msb/e_r/toynbee6.pdf On Arnold Toynbee]", ed. John K. Whitaker, ''Marshall Studies Bulletin'' 6 (1996): 45–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement movement focused on the causes of poverty through the "three Rs" - Research, Reform, and Residence. They provided a variety of services including educational, legal, and health services. These programs also advocated changes in social policy. Workers in the settlement movement immersed themselves in the culture of those they were helping. There were basic commonalities in the movement. These institutions were more concerned with societal causes for poverty, especially the changes that came with industrialization, rather than personal causes which their predecessors believed were the main reason for poverty. The settlement movement believed that social reform was best pursued and pushed for by private charities.&lt;ref name="BoiseStateIII"/&gt;

The movement gave rise to many social policy initiatives and innovative ways of working to improve the conditions of the most excluded members of society. Participating universities settled students in [[slum]]s to live and work alongside the poor local people. Settlement houses focused on education, savings, sports, and arts. The Poor Man's Lawyer service came about because a barrister volunteered his time and encouraged his friends to do the same. In general, the settlement movement, and settlement houses in particular, were "...a foundation for social work practice in this country".&lt;ref&gt;Reyes, J. M. (2008). Common space, safe place: Lived experiences of former settlement house participants from the West Town and Humboldt Park neighborhoods of Chicago''  Dissertation Abstract International'', ''69''(5), 1682A. (UMI No. AAI3314871) Retrieved July 13, 2009, from Dissertations and Theses Database.&lt;/ref&gt;

One important participant in the scheme was the philanthropist [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]] who published his study ''Life and Labour of the People in London'' in 1889 while working at Toynbee Hall. The study was the first systematic attempt at gathering comprehensive statistics and mapping poverty and influenced both social research and the fight against poverty for decades afterwards.

===Further Development===
[[Image:Dublin Slum dwellers 1901 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Poverty in towns, slum dwellers in [[Dublin]], Ireland circa 1901.]]
By the beginning of the 20th century, these different organizations with their diverse intellectual underpinnings were beginning to coalesce into modern social work. Foundations were established to examine the root causes of social problems such as poverty, and social workers became more professional and scientific in their methodology. The Quaker philanthropist and chocolate manufacturer [[Joseph Rowntree (philanthropist)|Joseph Rowntree]] believed that social evils could be tackled by systematic research, and to that end founded the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]] in 1904.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.jrf.org.uk/about-us/history.asp History of JRF on official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123052812/http://jrf.org.uk/about-us/history.asp |date=2009-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowntree wanted to tackle the root causes of social problems, rather than treating their symptoms. His Memorandum of 1904 stated: "I feel that much of the current philanthropic effort is directed to remedying the more superficial manifestations of weakness or evil, while little thought or effort is directed to search out their underlying causes ... [seek] to search out the under-lying causes of weakness or evil in the community, rather than ... remedying their more superficial manifestations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jrf.org.uk/about-us/our-heritage JRF's Our heritage page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowntree's son, [[Seebohm Rowntree]], carried out a series of seminal surveys into poverty in the city of [[York]] that greatly influenced public and governmental attitudes towards poverty and deprivation. His first York study of 1899 (this was followed up in 1935 and 1951) was a comprehensive survey into the living conditions of the poor in York during which investigators visited every working class home. This amounted to the detailed study of 11,560 families or 46,754 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Asa, ''Social Thought and Social Action'', page 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this study were published in 1901 in his book [[Poverty, A Study of Town Life]] and claimed that 27.84 percent of the total population of York lived below the poverty line.&lt;ref&gt;Rowntree, B S: "Poverty: A Study in Town Life", page 298. Macmillian and CO., 1901&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowntree defined the poverty line in terms of a minimum weekly sum of money "necessary to enable families... to secure the necessaries of a healthy life", including fuel and light, rent, food, clothing, and household and personal items. This was quantified using scientific methods that hadn't been applied to the study of poverty before. For example, he consulted leading [[nutritionist]]s of the period to discover the minimum [[calorific]] intake and nutritional balance necessary before people got ill or lost weight. He then surveyed the prices of food in York to discover what the cheapest prices in the area for the food needed for this minimum [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] were and used this information to set his poverty line.

In analysing the results of the investigation he found that people at certain stages of life, for example in old age and early childhood, were more likely to be in abject poverty, living below the poverty line, than at other stages of life. From this he formulated the idea of the poverty cycle&lt;ref&gt;Searle, G R: "A New England?", page 196. Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; in which some people moved in and out of absolute poverty during their lives. Rowntree's argument that poverty was the result of low wages went against the traditionally held view that the poor were responsible for their own plight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jrf.org.uk/centenary/poverty.html Joseph Rowntree Foundation Centenary: Poverty&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012011147/http://www.jrf.org.uk/centenary/poverty.html |date=2008-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The differing approaches to social work often led to heated debates. In the early 20th century, [[Mary Richmond]] of the [[Charity Organization Society]] (COS) and [[Jane Addams]] of the [[Settlement movement|Settlement House Movement]] engaged in a public dispute over the optimal approach; whether the problem should be tackled with COS' traditional, [[scientific method]] that focused on efficiency and prevention, or whether the Settlement House Movement's immersion into the problem, blurring the lines of practitioner and client, was superior.&lt;ref name="Social Work"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Parker-Oliver | first = Debra|author2=Demiris, George | title = Social Work Informatics: A New Specialty | journal = Social Work | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–134 | publisher = [[National Association of Social Workers]] | date = April 2006 | url =http://lysander.naswpressonline.org/vl=7534711/cl=13/nw=1/rpsv/cw/nasw/00378046/v51n2/s4/p127| accessdate =2008-02-19| pmid = 16858918 | doi=10.1093/sw/51.2.127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even as schools of social work opened and formalized processes for social work began to be developed, the question "is social work a profession?" lingered. In 1915, at the American National Conference of Charities and Corrections, Dr. [[Abraham Flexner]] spoke on the topic "Is Social Work a Profession?" He contended that it was not because it lacked specialized knowledge and specific application of theoretical and intellectual knowledge to solve human and social problems.&lt;ref name="UM-SSW"&gt;{{cite web|title = From Charitable Volunteers to Architects of Social Welfare: A Brief History of Social Work |publisher = [[University of Michigan]] |url =http://www.ssw.umich.edu/ongoing/fall2001/briefhistory.html |accessdate = 2007-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the professionalization of social work, concentrating on case work and the scientific method..

==Medical Social Work==
[[File:Jane Addams profile.jpg|150px|thumbnail|100px|[[Jane Addams]] (1860–1935) was a founder of the [[Settlement movement|U.S. Settlement House movement]] and is considered one of the early influences on professional social work in the United States.]]
The first professional [[medical social work]]ers in England were called hospital almoners, and were based in medical institutions. The [[Royal Free Hospital]], London hired [[Mary Stewart (social worker)|Mary Stewart]] as the first almoner in 1895. Her role was to assess people requesting treatment at the hospital to ensure that they were considered "deserving enough" of the free treatment. The role soon developed to cover the provision of other social programs, and by 1905 other hospitals had created similar roles.  By this time, the Hospital Almoners Council had been formed to oversee the new profession.&lt;ref name=gehlert/&gt;

The first professional medical social workers to be hired in the United States were Garnet Pelton (6 months) and Ida Cannon (40 years), in 1905 at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. Dr. [[Richard Clarke Cabot]] was a key advocate in the creation of the role, as he believed there to be a link between tuberculosis and sanitary conditions. Both Pelton and Cannon had trained as nurses before taking up the role. After graduating from Simmons College in 1907, Cabot was in charge of the outpatient ward of the hospital, and together with the newly created social workers, they redefined the way in which health and wellbeing was managed. The economic, social, family and psychological conditions that underpinned many of the conditions that patients presented with were recognised for the first time. Social workers would work in a complementary relationship with doctors, the former concentrating on physiological health, and the latter on social health. In addition to this, he saw that social work could improve medicine by providing a critical perspective on it while working alongside it in an organisational setting.

This approach soon spread through other American hospitals, and in 1911, there were 44 social work departments in 14 different cities. Two years later, the number of social work departments had grown to 200. After 1905, most social workers were trained as nurses. The American Association of Hospital Social Workers was set up in 1918 to increase the links between formal education and hospital practice.  In 1929 there were ten university courses in medical social work.  Around this time, [[psychiatry]] and [[psychology]] began to compete with social work as the complementary discourse to medicine in hospitals. Social work practice adapted to this by aligning itself more closely with [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic ideas]], and became less concerned with living conditions and social health. While this detracted from the social concerns, it added a more scientific basis to dealing with patients, and challenging behaviours were more likely to be seen as a mental dysfunction than poor moral character.&lt;ref name=gehlert/&gt;  The increase of social spending after World War Two saw another rise in the number of social workers.

==State Welfare==
[[Image:William Beveridge D 17134.jpg|thumb|200px|[[William Beveridge]]'s ''[[Beveridge Report]]'' of 1942 laid the foundations for the welfare state.]]
As the problem of poverty moved up the public agenda, it became increasingly clear that [[laissez-faire]] economic policies were not working and that governments had to take proactive measures to reduce poverty, rather than leave the task to privately run organizations. The principles of [[classical liberalism]] were being increasingly challenged by downturns in economic growth, a growing perception of the evils of poverty, unemployment and relative deprivation present within modern industrial cities, and the agitation of [[organized labour]]. New liberals began to adapt the old language of liberalism to confront these difficult circumstances, which they believed could only be resolved through a broader and more interventionist conception of the state.&lt;ref name='eatwell'&gt;{{Cite book|last=Eatwell|first=Roger|author2=Wright, Anthony|title=Contemporary political ideologies|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1999|isbn=9780826451736}}&lt;/ref&gt; A liberal convert to greater government intervention was [[Thomas Hill Green]], who believed that the state should foster and protect the social, political and economic environments in which individuals will have the best chance of acting according to their consciences. The state should intervene only where there is a clear, proven and strong tendency of a liberty to enslave the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, P. P., “T. H. Green and State Action: Liquor Legislation’, History of Political Thought, 6 (1985), 517–50. Reprinted in A. Vincent, ed., The Philosophy of T. H. Green (Aldershot: Gower, 1986), pp. 76–103&lt;/ref&gt;

This strand began to coalesce into the [[social liberalism]] movement at the turn of the twentieth century in Britain.&lt;ref name="adams"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|title=Political Ideology Today (Politics Today)|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|isbn=0719060206|year=2001|location=Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their view, the poverty, squalor, and ignorance in which many people lived made it impossible for freedom and individuality to flourish. In the early 1900s, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] under [[Herbert Henry Asquith|H.H. Asquith]] introduced various [[Liberal reforms|reforms]], including [[health insurance]], [[unemployment insurance]], and [[pension]]s for elderly workers, thereby laying the groundwork for the future British [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;Heywood, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Beveridge]], often called the 'architect of the welfare state', was pivotal in framing the debate about social work in the context of state welfare provision. His 1942 report on ''Social Insurance and Allied Services'',&lt;ref name="Original report title page"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beveridge|first1=William|title=Social Insurance and Allied Services|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritems/712beveridgereportpic.html|website=British Library|publisher=BL|accessdate=8 July 2014|ref=Original report title page|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714233116/http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritems/712beveridgereportpic.html|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; known commonly as the ''[[Beveridge Report]]'', identified five "Giant Evils" in society: squalor, ignorance, want, idleness, and disease, and went on to propose widespread reform to the system of social welfare to mitigate these problems.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Abel‐Smith, "The Beveridge report: Its origins and outcomes." ''International Social Security Review'' (1992) 45#1‐2 pp 5-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The report proved very popular with a war-weary public, and went on to form the basis to the post-war expansion of the Welfare State and the creation of the [[National Health Service]], a free at the point of delivery healthcare provider.

==Today==
Currently, social work is known for its critical and holistic approach to understanding and intervening in social problems. This has led, for example, to the recognition of poverty as having a social and economic basis rooted in social policies rather than representing a personal moral defect. This trend also points to another historical development in the evolution of social work: once a profession engages  in social control, it is directed at social and personal empowerment.

This is not to say that modern social workers do not engage in social control (consider, for example, child protection workers), and many, if not most, social workers likely would agree that there is an ongoing tension between these forces within the profession. For example, see the debate between structural social work and [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic social work]].&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;Payne, M. (2011). ''Humanistic Social Work: Core Principles in Practice. Chicago: Lyceum, Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''How to Clone a Mammoth: The Science of De-Extinction''''' is a [[2015 in literature|2015]] [[non-fiction]] book by biologist [[Beth Shapiro]] and published by [[Princeton University Press]]. The book describes the current state of [[de-extinction]] technology and what the processes involved require in order to accomplish the potential resurrection of extinct species.

==Content==
The book is laid out as a step-by-step guide on how to clone an animal, with each chapter detailing a different topic that needs to be explored and answered before de-extinction of a species will be complete. This also involves a particular focus on resurrection of the [[mammoth]].&lt;ref name="IHE"&gt;{{cite news |last=McLemee |first=Scott |date=July 29, 2015 |title=On the Verge of De-Extinction |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2015/07/29/review-beth-shapiro-how-clone-mammoth-science-de-extinction |newspaper=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |access-date=March 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several chapters deal with the genetic material itself and how to obtain it, along with the difficulties of recovering viable DNA samples from mummified or fossilized remains. Due to the actions of [[nucleases]] after cell death, most DNA of extinct species is fragmented into small pieces that have to be reconstructed at least partially if it is to be cloned. This fragmentation means that recovery of a full extinct genome is largely impossible. Thus, only partial genes can be utilized and the most viable method is to use a close evolutionary relative of the extinct species and insert the genes that differ into an embryo of the living species.&lt;ref name="IHE"/&gt; For mammoth de-extinction, any trait consideration would involve the [[Asian elephant]], the closest still-living relative. Using genes from extrapolated mammoth DNA, the Asian elephant could be made to survive across a wider range, including cold environments, protecting it against possible extinction. This gene transfer to benefit living species is one of the primary sources of research done with de-extinction technology in addition to the desire to revive lost species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Toomey |first=Diane |date=June 17, 2015 |title=Cloning a Mammoth: Science Fiction or Conservation Tool? |url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/cloning_a_mammoth_science_fiction_or_conservation_tool/2886/ |newspaper=[[Yale Environment 360]] |access-date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three following chapters discuss current technology available for moving genes and creating modified elephant genomes, including [[CRISPR]] (Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats) and [[TALENS]] (Transcription Activator-like Effector Nucleases).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=Steve |date=July 11, 2015 |title=How not to clone a mammoth |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)61229-6/fulltext?rss%3Dyes |journal=[[The Lancet]] |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |volume=386 |issue=9989 |pages=125 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)61229-6 |access-date=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final chapters discuss the environmental benefits and potential drawbacks of mammoths or other extinct species being reintroduced. For mammoths specifically, their heavy weight and specific methods of foraging help grasslands grow in colder climates, potentially turning [[Siberia]]n [[permafrost]] into a [[tundra]]-like region with numerous plant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bohac |first=Allison |date=June 13, 2015 |title=Extinct species may get a second chance |url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extinct-species-may-get-second-chance |journal=[[Science News]] |publisher=[[Society for Science and the Public]] |volume=187 |issue=12 |pages=27 |doi= |access-date=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and tone==
Shaoni Bhattacharya in ''[[New Scientist]]'' noted that while the book "can be a little academic", Shapiro manages to explain "complex molecular biology clearly" and that it "really comes alive, though, when she describes her own expeditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bhattacharya |first=Shaoni |date=May 20, 2015 |title=''How to Clone a Mammoth'': But should we? |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22630221-600-how-to-clone-a-mammoth-but-should-we/ |newspaper=[[New Scientist]] |access-date=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', Brian Switek describes Shapiro's writing style as "sharp, witty, and impeccably-argued" and that she writes "finely-honed prose" that "cuts through the hype that has clouded the debate" on whether it is possible to clone extinct animals and also whether such efforts should instead be directed toward assisting species that are currently in danger of extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Switek |first=Brian |date=April 10, 2015 |title=Book in Brief: How to Clone a Mammoth  |url=http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2015/04/10/book-in-brief-how-to-clone-a-mammoth/ |newspaper=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |access-date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caspar Henderson for ''[[The Spectator]]'' called the book's writing "lively, skeptical and nuanced" and stated that Shapiro covered topics with "great clarity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Henderson |first=Caspar |date=May 16, 2015 |title=If we recreate the mammoth, it will be 99.999 per cent white elephant |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2015/05/recreating-the-mammoth-99-999-per-cent-white-elephant/ |newspaper=[[The Spectator]] |access-date=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', A. Rus Hoelzel characterized the writing as "rich in anecdote and scientifically precise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoelzel |first=A. Rus |date=July 24, 2015 |title=Raising the dead |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6246/388 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] |volume=349 |issue=6246 |pages=388 |doi=10.1126/science.aaa9849 |access-date=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Alec Rodriguez praised the book's writing in a ''[[Yale Scientific]]'' article, approving of the conciseness and yet approachable technical detail that is included in the book while still remaining smooth in its flow between subjects. Rodriguez concluded that the book also "leaves the reader optimistic" in regards to future scientific advancements and the usage of [[Pleistocene Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rodriguez |first=Alec |date=November 4, 2015 |title=Book Review: How to Clone a Mammoth |url=http://www.yalescientific.org/2015/11/book-review-how-to-clone-a-mammoth/ |newspaper=[[Yale Scientific]] |access-date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Times Higher Education]]'''s Tiffany Taylor considered the work a "thought-provoking book [that] offers excitement and wonder" and that, through Shapiro's writing and direct discussion, the book manages to "paint a scientifically accurate yet magical world where Pleistocene giants might roam the Arctic tundra once again, and where we have the chance to undo some past mistakes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Tiffany |date=May 21, 2015 |title=How to Clone a Mammoth: The Science of De-extinction, by Beth Shapiro |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/how-to-clone-a-mammoth-thescience-of-de-extinction-by-beth-shapiro/2020229.article |newspaper=[[Times Higher Education]] |access-date=April 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' applauded the book's attempt to state plainly the science involved and determined that readers will "emerge with the ability to think more deeply about the facts of de-extinction and cloning at a time when hyperbolic and emotionally manipulative claims about such scientific breakthroughs are all too common".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Nonfiction Book Review: How to Clone a Mammoth: The Science of De-Extinction |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-691-15705-4 |newspaper=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=March 23, 2015 |access-date=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kent H. Redford in the journal ''[[Oryx (journal)|Oryx]]'' recommended that others read the book, adding that it "will make everyone think, will make some mad, others inspired, and hopefully will educate all conservationists to the extraordinary potential opportunities, good and bad, that de-extinction presents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Redford |first=Kent H. |date=January 2016 |title=Publications: How to Clone a Mammoth: The Science of De-extinction |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=10083476&amp;fileId=S0030605315001350 |journal=[[Oryx (journal)|Oryx]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=186 |doi=10.1017/S0030605315001350 |access-date=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]'', Derek D. Turner called the writing "careful, accessible, and thoughtful", while also pointing out that the book as a whole "conveys a sense of excitement about the science, but without the uncritical techno-optimism that one sees in many popular articles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turner |first=Derek D. |date=March 2016 |title=New Biological Books: How to Clone a Mammoth: The Science of De-Extinction |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/685309?journalCode=qrb |journal=[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]] |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=73 |doi=10.1086/685309 |access-date=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip J. Seddon in an article for the journal ''[[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]]'' described the book as an "important contribution to the ongoing debate" by how it changed the focus on what de-extinction is about to "ecological resurrection, and not species resurrection".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seddon |first=Philip J. |date=October 2015 |title=De-extinction: Reframing the Possible |url=http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/abstract/S0169-5347(15)00206-2 |journal=[[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]] |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |volume=30 |issue=10 |pages=569–570 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2015.08.002 |access-date=April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Croatian Language and Linguistics''' ({{lang-hr|Institut za hrvatski jezik i jezikoslovlje}}) is an official institute in [[Croatia]] whose purpose is to preserve and foster the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] variety of the [[Serbo-Croatian|Serbo-Croatian language]]. It traces its history back to 1948, when it was part of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts (today's [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]). The modern institute dates back to Croatia's independence in 1991.

In communications and [[electronic engineering]], an '''intermediate frequency''' ('''IF''') is a [[frequency]] to which a [[carrier wave]] is shifted as an intermediate step in [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] or reception.&lt;ref name=Smith46/&gt; The intermediate frequency is created by mixing the carrier signal with a [[local oscillator]] signal in a process called [[heterodyning]], resulting in a signal at the difference or [[beat frequency]].   Intermediate frequencies are used in [[Superheterodyne receiver|superheterodyne]] [[radio receiver]]s, in which an incoming signal is shifted to an IF for [[Amplifier|amplification]] before final [[Detector (radio)|detection]] is done.

Conversion to an intermediate frequency is useful for several reasons. When several stages of filters are used, they can all be set to a fixed frequency, which makes them easier to build and to tune. Lower frequency transistors generally have higher gains so fewer stages are required.  It's easier to make sharply selective filters at lower fixed frequencies.

There may be several such stages of intermediate frequency in a superheterodyne receiver; two or three stages are called  ''double'' (alternatively, ''dual'') or ''triple'' ''conversion'', respectively.

==Reasons for using IF==
Intermediate frequencies are used for three general reasons.&lt;ref name="ArmyManual"&gt;{{cite book

 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; At very high ([[gigahertz]]) frequencies, signal processing circuitry performs poorly. Active devices such as [[transistor]]s cannot deliver much amplification ([[Gain (electronics)|gain]]).&lt;ref name="Smith46"&gt;F. Langford Smith (ed) ''[[Radiotron Designer's Handbook]]'', 3rd Edition (Wireless Press 1946) Page 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 1946 ''[[Radiotron Designer's Handbook]]'' observes on page 159 that some short-wave receivers operate with an IF of 1600 kHz and that "At such a high frequency one or two additional IF stages are required are necessary to provide sufficient gain."&lt;/ref&gt;  Ordinary circuits using [[capacitor]]s and [[inductor]]s must be replaced with cumbersome high frequency techniques such as [[stripline]]s and [[waveguide]]s. So a high frequency signal is converted to a lower IF for more convenient processing.  For example, in [[satellite dish]]es, the microwave downlink signal received by the dish is converted to a much lower IF at the dish, to allow a relatively inexpensive [[coaxial cable]] to carry the signal to the receiver inside the building.  Bringing the signal in at the original microwave frequency would require an expensive [[waveguide]].

A second reason, in receivers that can be tuned to different frequencies, is to convert the various different frequencies of the stations to a common frequency for processing. It is difficult to build multistage [[amplifier]]s, [[Electronic filter|filters]], and [[detector (radio)|detector]]s that can have all stages track in tuning different frequencies, but it is comparatively easy to build tunable [[Electronic oscillator|oscillators]]. Superheterodyne receivers tune in different frequencies by adjusting the frequency of the local oscillator on the input stage, and all processing after that is done at the same fixed frequency, the IF.   Without using an IF, all the complicated filters and detectors in a radio or television would have to be tuned in unison each time the frequency  was changed, as was necessary in the early [[tuned radio frequency receiver]]s.   A more important advantage is that it gives the receiver a constant bandwidth over its tuning range.  The bandwidth of a filter is proportional to its center frequency.  In receivers like the TRF in which the filtering is done at the incoming RF frequency, as the receiver is tuned to higher frequencies its bandwidth increases.

The main reason for using an intermediate frequency is to improve frequency [[Selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]].&lt;ref name="Smith46" /&gt; In communication circuits, a very common task is to separate out or extract signals or components of a signal that are close together in frequency. This is called [[Filter (signal processing)|filtering]]. Some examples are, picking up a radio station among several that are close in frequency, or extracting the [[chrominance]] subcarrier from a TV signal. With all known filtering techniques the filter's [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] increases proportionately with the  frequency. So a narrower bandwidth and more selectivity can be achieved by converting the signal to a lower IF and performing the filtering at that frequency.  [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and [[television broadcasting]] with their narrow channel widths, as well as more modern telecommunications services such as [[cell phone]]s and [[cable television]], would be impossible without using frequency conversion.&lt;ref name="Dixon"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Perhaps the most commonly used intermediate frequencies for broadcast receivers are around 455&amp;nbsp;kHz for AM receivers and 10.7&amp;nbsp;MHz for FM receivers. In special purpose receivers other frequencies can be used. A dual-conversion receiver may have two intermediate frequencies, a higher one to improve image rejection and a second, lower one, for desired selectivity. A first intermediate frequency may even be higher than the input signal, so that all undesired responses can be easily filtered out by a fixed-tuned RF stage.&lt;ref name=ARRL77&gt;Wes Hayward, Doug De Maw (ed),''Solid state design for the radio amateur'', (American Radio Relay League, 1977) pp. 82-87&lt;/ref&gt;

In a digital receiver, the analog to digital converter ([[analog to digital converter|ADC]]) operates at low sampling rates, so input RF must be mixed down to IF to be processed. Intermediate frequency tends to be lower frequency range compared to the transmitted RF frequency.   However, the choices for the IF are most dependent on the available components such as mixer, filters, amplifiers and others that can operate at lower frequency. There are other factors involved in deciding the IF frequency, because lower IF is susceptible to noise and higher IF can cause clock jitters.

Modern [[satellite television]] receivers use several intermediate frequencies.&lt;ref name="Lundstrom"&gt;{{cite book

The downlink signal is received by a [[satellite dish]].  In the box at the focus of the dish, called a [[low-noise block downconverter]] (LNB), each block of frequencies is converted to the IF range of 950 - 2150&amp;nbsp;MHz by two fixed frequency local oscillators at 9.75 and 10.6&amp;nbsp;GHz.  One of the two blocks is selected by a control signal from the set top box inside, which switches on one of the local oscillators.   This IF is carried into the building to the television receiver on a coaxial cable.  At the cable company's [[set top box]], the signal is converted to a lower IF of 480&amp;nbsp;MHz for filtering, by a variable frequency oscillator.&lt;ref name="Lundstrom" /&gt;  This is sent through a 30&amp;nbsp;MHz bandpass filter, which selects the signal from one of the [[transponder]]s on the satellite, which carries several channels.  Further processing selects the channel desired, demodulates it and sends the signal to the television.

==History==

An intermediate frequency was first used in the superheterodyne radio receiver, invented by American scientist Major [[Edwin Armstrong]] in 1918, during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A member of the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]], Armstrong was building radio [[direction finding]] equipment to track German military signals at the then-very high frequencies of 500 to 3500&amp;nbsp;kHz. The [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]] amplifiers of the day would not amplify stably above 500&amp;nbsp;kHz, however, it was easy to get them to [[Electronic oscillator|oscillate]] above that frequency.   Armstrong's solution was to set up an oscillator tube that would create a frequency near the incoming signal, and mix it with the incoming signal in a 'mixer' tube, creating a 'heterodyne' or signal at the lower difference frequency, where it could be amplified easily. For example, to pick up a signal at 1500&amp;nbsp;kHz the local oscillator would be tuned to 1450&amp;nbsp;kHz. Mixing the two created an intermediate frequency of 50&amp;nbsp;kHz, which was well within the capability of the tubes.

After the war, in 1920, Armstrong sold the patent for the superheterodyne to [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], who subsequently sold it to [[RCA]]. The increased complexity of the superheterodyne circuit compared to earlier [[Regenerative receiver|regenerative]] or [[tuned radio frequency receiver]] designs slowed its use, but the advantages of the intermediate frequency for selectivity and static rejection eventually won out; by 1930, most radios sold were 'superhets'. During the development of [[radar]] in [[World War II]], the superheterodyne principle was essential for downconversion of the very high radar frequencies to intermediate frequencies. Since then, the superheterodyne circuit, with its intermediate frequency, has been used in virtually all radio receivers.

==Commonly used intermediate frequencies==
* 110&amp;nbsp;kHz was used in [[Long wave]] broadcast receivers.&lt;ref name="Smith46"/&gt;{{rp|159}}
*[[Analog transmission|Analogue]] television receivers using system M: 41.25&amp;nbsp;MHz (audio) and 45.75&amp;nbsp;MHz (video). Note, the channel is flipped over in the conversion process in an [[intercarrier method|intercarrier]] system, so the audio IF frequency is lower than the video IF frequency. Also, there is no audio local oscillator, the injected video carrier serves that purpose.
*[[Analog transmission|Analogue]] television receivers using system B and similar systems: 33.4&amp;nbsp;MHz. for aural and 38.9&amp;nbsp;MHz. for visual signal. (The discussion about the frequency conversion is the same as in system M).
*[[FM radio]] receivers: 262&amp;nbsp;kHz, 455&amp;nbsp;kHz, 1.6&amp;nbsp;MHz, 5.5&amp;nbsp;MHz, 10.7&amp;nbsp;MHz, 10.8&amp;nbsp;MHz, 11.2&amp;nbsp;MHz, 11.7&amp;nbsp;MHz, 11.8&amp;nbsp;MHz, 21.4&amp;nbsp;MHz, 75&amp;nbsp;MHz and 98&amp;nbsp;MHz. In double-conversion superheterodyne receivers, a first intermediate frequency of 10.7&amp;nbsp;MHz is often used, followed by a second intermediate frequency of 470&amp;nbsp;kHz. There are triple conversion designs used in police scanner receivers, high-end communications receivers, and many point-to-point microwave systems. Modern DSP chip consumer radios often use a 'low-IF' of 128kHz for FM.
*[[AM radio]] receivers: 450&amp;nbsp;kHz, 455&amp;nbsp;kHz, 460&amp;nbsp;kHz, 465&amp;nbsp;kHz, 467&amp;nbsp;kHz, 470&amp;nbsp;kHz, 475&amp;nbsp;kHz, 480&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;Ravalico D. E., ''Radioelementi'', Milan, Hoepli, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Satellite [[uplink]]-[[downlink]] equipment: 70&amp;nbsp;MHz, 950–1450&amp;nbsp;MHz (L-band) downlink first IF.
*Terrestrial [[microwave]] equipment: 250&amp;nbsp;MHz, 70&amp;nbsp;MHz or 75&amp;nbsp;MHz.
*[[Radar]]: 30&amp;nbsp;MHz.
*[[Radio frequency|RF]] Test Equipment: 310.7&amp;nbsp;MHz, 160&amp;nbsp;MHz, 21.4&amp;nbsp;MHz.

== History ==

=== Formation ===
The origins of the Kinsey Institute lie in the scientific research of [[Indiana University]] professor and entomologist turned sexuality researcher, [[Alfred Kinsey]].  The 1947 creation of the nonprofit institute, originally named the Institute for Sex Research (ISR), was supported by both Indiana University president [[Herman B Wells]] and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], a major financial backer of Kinsey’s research. The ISR was established to protect and preserve the confidentiality of Kinsey’s data and research materials by creating a secure, permanent repository for them.&lt;ref&gt;Gathorne-Hardy, Jonathon. Sex the Measure of All Things : A Life of Alfred C. Kinsey. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2000. Print.; 249&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred Kinsey was director of the institute from 1947 until his death in 1956. Since then, the institute has had six directors: [[Paul Gebhard]] PhD (1956–1982), June Reinisch PhD (1982–1993), Stephanie Sanders PhD (interim director, 1993–1995), [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]] MD (1994–2004), [[Julia Heiman]] PhD (2004–2014), and [[C. Sue Carter]] (2014-present).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/about/previous.html |title=previous directors |publisher=Kinseyinstitute.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409004717/http://kinseyinstitute.org/about/previous.html |archivedate=2014-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kinsey's directorship (1947–1956) ===
Shortly after the ISR’s establishment, Kinsey’s interview based research was published in the 1948 bestselling&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, Vern L. Science in the Bedroom: A History of Sex Research. New York: Basic Books, 1994. Print ; 181.&lt;/ref&gt;  book, ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male''.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsey, Alfred C., Wardell B. Pomeroy, and Clyde E. Martin. Sexual Behavior in the Human Male. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders Co., 1948. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Its companion ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'' was published 5 years later.&lt;ref&gt;Research, Institute for Sex. Sexual Behavior in the Human Female. Philadelphia: Saunders, 1953. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; These books were popularly known as the “[[Kinsey Reports]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Gathorne-Hardy, Jonathon. Sex the Measure of All Things : A Life of Alfred C. Kinsey. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2000. Print; 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in 1950, research materials being shipped to the ISR were seized by U.S. Customs thereby resulting in the federal court case U.S. vs. 31 photographs. This case continued on after Kinsey’s death, until it was finally settled in the institute’s favor in 1957.  The ruling granted ISR permission to import erotic materials for research purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Kenneth R. "United States V. 31 Photographs: Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey and Obscenity Law." Indiana Magazine of History 71.4 (1975): 299-318. Print ; 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gebhard's directorship (1956–1982) ===
Under Paul Gebhard's leadership, the interview based research project continued, resulting in the publication of ''[[Pregnancy, Birth and Abortion]]''&lt;ref&gt;Gebhard, Paul H., Wardell B. Pomeroy, and Clyde E. Martin. "Pregnancy, Birth and Abortion ". New York: Harper, 1958. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Sex Offenders (1965 book)|Sex Offenders: An Analysis of Types]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Research, Institute for Sex. Sex Offenders; an Analysis of Types New York: Harper and Row, 1965.

The Kinsey Data : Marginal Tabulations of the 1938-1963 Interviews Conducted by the Institute for Sex Research Philadelphia: Saunders, 1979. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  To honor its founder, the Institute for Sex Research was renamed The Kinsey Institute for Sex Research in 1981.&lt;ref name="kinseyinstitute1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/library/kiarchives.html |title=Library &amp; Special Collections&amp;#93; |publisher=The Kinsey Institute |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429195952/http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/library/kiarchives.html |archivedate=2014-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== June Reinisch's directorship (1982–1993) ===
When [[June Machover Reinisch]] became the new director, the name of the institute changed to The Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction, in order to better reflect its expanded mission.&lt;ref name="kinseyinstitute1"/&gt;  During her first years as director, as part of her contract with the University, the Institute was completely renovated and expanded adding a new full floor for the library including temperature and humidity controlled stacks, a scholars' reading room, additional staff offices, and The John Money Visiting Scholars Study, an art gallery and new archives for the art and artifacts collections and additional research offices and laboratory space. Reinisch’s directorship also saw the creation of a five-volume monographic series, The Kinsey Institute Series, beginning with the publication of ''Masculinity/Femininity''&lt;ref&gt;Reinisch, June Machover, ed. Masculinity/Femininity : Basic Perspectives. New York: Oxford University Press, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting from institute- sponsored multidisciplinary seminars.  Research focused on at-risk sexual behavior and the effects of prenatal exposure to medications on sexual and psychosexual development. Additionally, in 1990 the establishment of the institute’s art gallery led to exhibitions featuring its art collection.&lt;ref&gt;Becherer. J. P. Selections from the collections of the Kinsey Institute. Bloomington, IN: The Kinsey Institute, 1990. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
From 1984 to 1993, with direction from Indiana University to play an active role in public education, the Institute produced “The Kinsey Report,” an internationally syndicated newspaper column.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, Vern L. Science in the Bedroom: A History of Sex Research. New York: Basic Books, 1994. Print; 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Although "The Kinsey Report" is no longer a syndicated column, the Kinsey Institute continues to maintain a sex and sexuality FAQ and statistics page on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kinseyinstitute.org/research/faq.php|title=Sex FAQs and statistics|author=|date=|website=kinseyinstitute.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a trade book aimed at popular audiences, ''The Kinsey Institute New Report on Sex: What you must know to be Sexually Literate'', was released in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Reinisch, June Machover with Ruth Beasley. The Kinsey Institute New Report on Sex : What You Must Know to Be Sexually Literate New York: St. Martin's Press, 1991. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dr. Stephanie Sanders's interim directorship (1993–1995) ===
Following June Reinisch's retirement, Dr. Stephanie Sanders held the Institute's research and curriculum programs together as the Board reorganized its internal structure amid drastic budget cuts from Indiana University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwitimes.com/uncategorized/year-after-director-s-retirement-sex-institute-still-without/article_68197bd2-da6e-5f76-b974-143db156654a.html|title=Year after director's retirement, sex institute still without|first=Associated|last=Press|date=|website=nwitimes.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kinseyinstitute.org/about/profiles/ssanders.php|title=Stephanie A.

=== John Bancroft's directorship (1995–2004) ===
From 1995 to 2001, The Kinsey Institute operated a clinic for sexual health and menstrual problems under the directorship of John Bancroft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/about/chronology.html |title=History - Event Chronology [About the Institute&amp;#93; |publisher=The Kinsey Institute |date=1947-04-08 |accessdate=2014-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928231429/http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/about/chronology.html |archivedate=2013-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research focus was placed upon the psychology of sexual behavior, hormonal effects on sex, and sexuality and well-being.  Bancroft and Erick Janssen developed the Dual-control model of sexual arousal, a theory of sexual arousal involving inhibitory and excitation processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/graduate/phminor.html |title=Graduate Education&amp;#93; |publisher=The Kinsey Institute |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999, the website Kinsey Confidential (originally called Kinsey Institute Sexuality Information Service for Students) was started to provide research-based information regarding sexuality to college-aged adults. It includes sex questions and answers provided by sex researcher and columnist [[Debby Herbenick]], PhD in both column-format and podcast-format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kinseyconfidential.org/about/ |title=About |publisher=Kinsey Confidential |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the following year, the institute began regularly rotating exhibitions of artwork and archival materials in addition to offering public tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=94814&amp;page=1 |title=Sex Institute Opens Its Doors to Public - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Julia Heiman's directorship (2004–2013) ===
In 2006, the institute began hosting an annual juried art show.&lt;ref name="newsinfo1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/18550.html |title=Contemporary art: The Kinsey Institute Juried Art Show 2011: IU News Room: Indiana University |publisher=Newsinfo.iu.edu |date=2011-05-12 |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, The Kinsey Institute also hosted the inaugural conference of The University Consortium for Sexuality Research and Training.&lt;ref name="newsinfo1"/&gt;  Also, a question and answer column from the Kinsey Confidential runs in university newspapers including Indiana University’s  [[Indiana Daily Student]].&lt;ref&gt;"Kinsey Confidential."

=== Sue Carter's directorship (2014–present) ===
[[C. Sue Carter|Sue Carter]], a pioneer in examining mechanisms underlying love, bonding and other emotions, 
was named director in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;''Sue Carter named director of The Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, Researcher a pioneer in examining mechanisms underlying love, bonding and other emotions'' IU Bloomington Newsroom, Oct. 29, 2014

=== Library, archive, and art collection ===
The Kinsey Institute is considered to have one of the largest collections of library, archival, and art materials pertaining to sex, gender, and reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, Wardell B. Dr. Kinsey and the Institute for Sex Research. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1972. Print; 458.&lt;/ref&gt;  The current collection began as Alfred Kinsey’s private research collection.  To ensure its protection, Kinsey sold it to the institute for one dollar.&lt;ref&gt;Harter, Margaret H., and June Machover Reinish. "Kinsey, Alfred C." Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia. Eds. Bullough, Bonnie and Vern Bullough. New York: Garland Publishing, Inc., 1994. Print; 335.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, neither state nor grant money have been used to build collections.  Instead the institute uses funds obtained from book royalties and fees in addition to donations. A sampling of the broad range of items housed at the institute includes scientific and popular books, pulp magazines, publications from both sexual and anti-sexual organizations, data from Kinsey’s original interview project, films, photos, erotic objects, and artwork by both professionals and amateurs.  Items from all over the world are represented in the collection and some objects even date back to the pre-Columbian era.&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy, Wardell B. Dr. Kinsey and the Insititute for Sex Research. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1972. Print; 458-460.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, materials do not circulate and must be studied within the reading room which is open to scholars, professionals, university faculty, and students over eighteen who are researching topics pertaining to sexuality, gender, and reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/library/use.html |title=Library &amp; Special Collections&amp;#93; |publisher=The Kinsey Institute |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416175443/http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/library/use.html |archivedate=2014-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the highly specialized nature of the collection, holdings are described using subject headings created by The Kinsey Institute and organized using a modified version of the Dewey Decimal System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/library/kicat-guide.html#what |title=Library &amp; Special Collections&amp;#93; |publisher=The Kinsey Institute |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20720">[[Brazil]] has established a strong public policy using Clean Development Mechanism Projects to reduce [[methane emissions]] from [[landfill]]s. An important component of these projects is the sale of avoided emissions by the private market to generate revenue.

==Introduction==
Faced with serious pollution challenges, [[Brazil]] established [[public policy]] that would create incentives for the foreign and national private market to invest financial, technological, and human resources in the country.  The premise is that experienced companies would bring their technology to Brazil, in an effort to reduce [[methane]] gas emissions.  The specific technology and projects discussed in this article refer to [[landfill gas]] projects.  Although this technology was new to Brazil in the early 2000s when companies first began implementing them, these methods were not new to [[Europe]] or [[North America]].  Additionally, Brazil is just one of many countries participating in similar projects around the world.

==Background==
Brazil signed the [[Kyoto Protocol]] on April 29, 1998 and ratified it on August 23, 2002.&lt;ref name="UNFCCC PDF"&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Estimated projections by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) show that by 2012, Brazil will have 102 million [[certified emission reductions]] (CER), a $1,225 million value.  Unlike its fellow BRIC countries, in Brazil the largest component of potential CER projects is landfill gas projects, with a 31.3% share.&lt;ref name="BRIC Plus" /&gt;  According to the national survey on basic sanitation (PNSB) conducted in 2008, all of the 5,564 municipalities have access to basic sanitation.&lt;ref name="PNSB 2008 Study"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Environmental Sanitation Technology Company (CETESB) study, the 6,000 waste sites in Brazil receive 60,000 tonnes of waste per day.  Seventy-six percent (76%) of this waste goes to dumps with no management, gas collection, or water treatment.  This same study showed that 83.18% of Brazil's methane gas emissions come from uncontrolled waste sites.&lt;ref name="CETESB Study"&gt;

==Landfill gas projects==
Private companies have submitted CDM projects to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) to use [[landfill gas]] (LFG) discharges from waste management sites to earn carbon credits or CER.  There are over 100 LFG CDM projects in Brazil.&lt;ref name="BRIC Plus" /&gt;  The diagram below illustrates the process.&lt;ref name = "LFG White Paper"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carbon Credit Flow Chart.png|center|750px]]
First, once the waste management company has developed the landfill with the new technology, (1a) it calculates how much methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) would have been emitted into the air '''without''' its intervention.  (1b) Then it converts the CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; into carbon equivalents (C0&lt;sub&gt;2e&lt;/sub&gt;).  (2a) Next, the company projects how much methane it expects to emit into the air, '''with''' the new technology.  Again, (2b) it converts the CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; into C0&lt;sub&gt;2e&lt;/sub&gt;.  (3) Next, the company determines the avoided emissions or CER but subtracting the emission projections with the technology from the baseline emissions without the technology.  (4) Once credited, the company sells the CER through a broker to companies that will produce emissions greater than their allotted capacity.

Onyx SASA is a subsidiary of [[Veolia Environnement]] and is an officially registered project with UNFCCC, as of November 24, 2005.  SenterNovem, an agency of the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs in the Netherlands, is a partner in the project.  The following flow chart depicts the process used by the landfill:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Landfill Gas Clean Development Mechanism Monitoring System.png|center|750px]]
&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) or carbon equivalents (CO&lt;sub&gt;2e&lt;/sub&gt;) are captured by the vertical wells.  (2) Next, a horizontal drain that is connected to the vertical wells extracts the CO&lt;sub&gt;2e&lt;/sub&gt;.  (3) Then, a high density collection pipe captures the CO&lt;sub&gt;2e&lt;/sub&gt; and transfers it to the evaporator.  (4) Any CO&lt;sub&gt;2e&lt;/sub&gt; that did not evaporate, is transferred to an enclosed flare.	(5) The remaining emissions are then vented into the air.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the filing of the report, Onyx SASA anticipated the landfill would accrue 700,625 tons CO&lt;sub&gt;2e&lt;/sub&gt; from 2003 through 2012 in CER.  As of 2011, Onyx SASA has filed monitoring reports for the periods of 2003 through 2007.  The following chart outlines the actual CER realized to date:

&lt;br /&gt;
The goal of the EPLGP is to reduce greenhouse emissions.  The following schematic illustrates the process of capturing and recycling the gas emissions:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Active Gas Recovery Landfill.png|center|500px]]
&lt;br /&gt;
As illustrated above, (1) wells installed in the landfill collect the methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).  (2) Next, high density pipes connected to the wells transfer the CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to the blower.  (3) Any remaining CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is then sent to the flare.  (4) Last, the CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is flared into the air.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
^The notable increase in actual CER versus the projected CER is due to the increase in waste received by the landfill, from 2.5 tons per day as reported in the CDM application to 5 tons per day.

'''Malnutrition–inflammation complex''' (syndrome), abbreviated as "'''MICS'''" and also known as "'''[[malnutrition]]–[[inflammation]]–[[cachexia]] [[syndrome]]'''", is a common condition in [[chronic disease states]] such as [[chronic kidney disease]] (where it is also known as [[uremic malnutrition]] or [[protein–energy malnutrition]]) and [[chronic heart failure]].

The MICS is believed to be a cause of survival paradoxes seen in these distinct patient populations, also known as [[reverse epidemiology]] populations.

A '''mound system''' is an alternative to the traditional rural [[septic system]] [[drain field]].  The mound system is an engineered drain field used in areas where septic systems are more prone to failure due to having extremely [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeable]] or impermeable soils, [[soil]] with shallow cover over porous bedrock, and soils that have a high seasonal [[water table]].&lt;ref name="WI1"&gt;Converse, J.C., and J.E. Tyler. 2000. "WISCONSIN MOUND SOIL ABSORPTION SYSTEM:." Accessed on 10 Oct. 2007. [http://www.soils.wisc.edu/sswmp/SSWMP_15.24.pdf Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary waste liquids cleaning and purification action in a drain field is performed by a [[biofilm]] in the loose fill surrounding the perforated drain tile. If the soil permeability is too low, liquid is not absorbed fast enough, resulting in surface ponding of unsanitary liquids. If the soil permeability is too high, or is exposed to  fractured bedrock, the wastewater quickly penetrates down to the water table before the biofilm has time to purify the water leading to contamination of the [[aquifer]]. In either situation, the mound system provides an ideal habitat for the biofilm and has the correct permeability to assure slow absorption of effluent into the mound before exiting as purified water into the surrounding environment.

==History==

The mound system was originally designed in the 1940s by the [[North Dakota State University|North Dakota College of Agriculture]].&lt;ref name="WI1"/&gt; It was known as the Nodak Disposal System.  In 1976 the [[University of Wisconsin]] studied the mound systems under the university's Waste Management Project.  This project published the first design manual indicating the appropriate site conditions and design criteria for mounds. In 2000 a new manual was released.&lt;ref name="WI1"/&gt;

==Design==
The mound system includes a [[septic tank]], a dosing chamber, and a mound.  Waste from homes is sent to the septic tank where the solid fraction settles to the bottom of the tank.  The effluent is sent to a second tank called a ''dosing chamber,'' from which the effluent is distributed to the mound at a metered rate (in ''doses'').  Wastewater is partially treated as it moves through the mound sand.  Final treatment and disposal occurs in the soil beneath the mound.  The mound system can also better handle the effluent since it doesn't all come into the mound at once allowing it to clean the effluent better which helps to keep the system from failing.

The absorption mound is built in layers at different depths. The depths of these layers are determined by the depth of the limiting layer of the soil, which may be a seasonal [[water table]], bedrock, [[fragipan]], or [[Till|glacial till]].&lt;ref name="Ohio8"&gt;Hamilton County General Health District. 2005. Household Sewage Treatment System. Hamilton County. Accessed on Oct. 15, 2007. [http://www.hamiltoncountyhealth.org/files/files/Fact%20Sheets/Water%20Quality/HSTS%20Manual/HSTS%20Manual%20Part%201.pdf Link]&lt;/ref&gt;  Standards created by [[Ohio State University]] state that 24&amp;nbsp;inches of natural soil should be above the limiting layer in the soil. A layer of specifically sized sand is placed on top of the natural soil so that the natural soil and sand reach a depth of 4 feet. The distribution pipes that are fed by the dosing chamber are placed on top of the sand in layers of gravel. Then [[Geotextile|construction fabric]] and soil are placed on top of the gravel to help keep the pipes from freezing.  The top layer of soil also allows the mound to be planted with grass or non-woody plants in order to control erosion &lt;ref name="Ref7"&gt;7 Mancl, K. 2001. Managing Septic Tank-Mound Systems. Ohio State University Extension Fact Sheet. Ohio State University. Accessed on 15 Oct 2007 [http://ohioline.osu.edu/aex-fact/0753.html Link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213191927/http://ohioline.osu.edu/aex-fact/0753.html |date=2007-12-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When installing a mound system, the soil in the area where the mound is to be placed will not be compacted or disturbed. Any trees that are on the area are cut away at ground level, and the roots and stumps left in place.  The surface of the area for the mound is then roughened up with a [[Plow#Chisel plough|chisel plough]]. This prepares the area for the sand. Work is done from upslope of the mound area so that the ground down slope of the mound does not get compacted. Tyler tables are used to help determine the area of a mound.
&lt;!-- nonexistent cite &lt;sup&gt;(11)&lt;/sup&gt; --&gt;

Time dosing is an important aspect in the functioning of the mound system.  Research done by Darby on sand filters showed that short frequent doses of effluent onto sand filters with orifices that are closely spaced helps to improve effluent quality.&lt;ref name="Ref10"&gt;Ohio Department of Health. 2007. Sand Mounds with Pressure Distribution. Special Device Approval per OAC 3701-29-20(C). Ohio Department of Health. Accessed on Dec 3, 2007 [http://www.odh.ohio.gov/ASSETS/966F83AB6DAE480DB50DD2A03A25A4C5/MDsd7-07.pdf Link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231162711/http://www.odh.ohio.gov/ASSETS/966F83AB6DAE480DB50DD2A03A25A4C5/MDsd7-07.pdf |date=2008-12-31 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, demand dosing releases large amounts of effluent at once, which passes through the sand very rapidly.  This does not give the biota the proper amount of time to clean the effluent.&lt;ref name="WI1"/&gt;

A '''museum''' ({{IPAc-en|m|juː|ˈ|z|iː|əm}} {{respell|mew|ZEE|əm}}; plural '''museums''' or, rarely, '''musea''') is an institution that [[Preservation (library and archival science)|cares for]] (conserves) a [[collection (artwork)|collection]] of artifacts and other objects of [[art]]istic, [[culture|cultural]], [[history|historical]], or [[science|scientific]] importance.  Many public museums make these items available for public viewing through [[display case|exhibits]] that may be permanent or temporary.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Porter Alexander, Mary Alexander; {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=owHSEk96qxQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Museums+history&amp;q= |title=Museums in motion: an introduction to the history and functions of museums |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2008 |accessdate=6 October 2009 |isbn=978-0759105096 |author1=Alexander, Mary |author2=Alexander, Edward Porter |date=September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest museums are located in major cities throughout the world, while thousands of local museums exist in smaller cities, towns and rural areas. Museums have varying aims, ranging from serving researchers and specialists to serving the general public. The goal of serving researchers is increasingly shifting to serving the [[general public]].

There are many types of museums, including art museums, natural history museums, science museums, war museums, and children's museums. Amongst the world's largest and most visited museums are the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]], the [[National Museum of China]] in [[Beijing]], the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], the [[British Museum]] and [[National Gallery]] in London, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]] and [[Vatican Museums]] in [[Vatican City]].

As of the 2010s, the continuing acceleration in the [[Digitizing|digitization]] of information, combined with the increasing capacity of [[computer data storage|digital information storage]], is causing the traditional model of museums (i.e. as static bricks-and-mortar "collections of collections" of three-dimensional specimens and artifacts) to expand to include [[Virtual museum|virtual exhibits]] and high-resolution images of their collections that patrons can peruse, study, and explore from any location with Internet access.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} According to The World Museum Community, there are more than 55,000 museums in 202 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icom.museum/resources/frequently-asked-questions/ Frequently Asked Questions] – The World Museum Community&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:State Historical Museum, Moscow, Russia.jpg|thumb|The [[State Historical Museum]] in [[Moscow]].]]

The English "museum" comes from the [[Latin]] word, and is pluralized as "museums" (or rarely, "musea"). It is originally from the [[Ancient Greek]] Μουσεῖον (''[[Musaeum|Mouseion]]''), which denotes a place or temple dedicated to the [[Muse]]s (the patron divinities in [[Greek mythology]] of the arts), and hence a building set apart for study and the arts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Findlen |first=Paula |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1989 |month= |title=The Museum: its classical etymology and renaissance genealogy |journal=Journal of the History of Collections |volume=1 |issue= 1|pages=59–78 |id= |url=http://jhc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/1/1/59 |accessdate= 5 April 2008 |quote=|doi=10.1093/jhc/1.1.59 }}&lt;/ref&gt; especially the [[Musaeum]] (institute) for [[philosophy]] and research at [[Alexandria]] by [[Ptolemy I Soter]] about 280 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/ptolemy1.htm |title= Ptolemy I Soter, The First King of Ancient Egypt's Ptolemaic Dynasty|accessdate=5 April 2008 |work=Tour Egypt }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
[[File:Bode_Museum.jpg|thumb|The [[Museum Island]] in [[Berlin]].]]
The purpose of modern museums is to collect, preserve, interpret, and display items of artistic, cultural, or scientific significance for the education of the public. From a visitor or community perspective, the purpose can also depend on one's point of view. A trip to a local history museum or large city art museum can be an entertaining and enlightening way to spend the day. To city leaders, a healthy museum community can be seen as a gauge of the economic health of a city, and a way to increase the sophistication of its inhabitants. To a museum professional, a museum might be seen as a way to educate the public about the museum's mission, such as civil rights or environmentalism. Museums are, above all, storehouses of knowledge. In 1829, James Smithson's bequest, that would fund the [[Smithsonian Institution]], stated he wanted to establish an institution "for the increase and diffusion of knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = Smithsonian Institution|title = James Smithson Society| url = https://www.si.edu/giving/membership/james-smithson-society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Museums of natural history in the late 19th century exemplified the Victorian desire for consumption and for order.  Gathering all examples of each classification of a field of knowledge for research and for display was the purpose.  As American colleges grew in the 19th century, they developed their own natural history collections for the use of their students.  By the last quarter of the 19th century, the scientific research in the universities was shifting toward biological research on a cellular level, and cutting edge research moved from museums to university laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Conn, "Museums and American Intellectual Life, 1876–1926", 1998, The University of Chicago Press, 65.&lt;/ref&gt;   While many large museums, such as the [[Smithsonian Institution]], are still respected as research centers, research is no longer a main purpose of most museums. While there is an ongoing debate about the purposes of interpretation of a museum's collection, there has been a consistent mission to protect and preserve artifacts for future generations.  Much care, expertise, and expense is invested in preservation efforts to retard decomposition in aging documents, artifacts, artworks, and buildings.  All museums display objects that are important to a culture.  As historian Steven Conn writes, "To see the thing itself, with one's own eyes and in a public place, surrounded by other people having some version of the same experience can be enchanting."&lt;ref&gt;Steven Conn, "Museums and American Intellectual Life, 1876–1926", 1998, The University of Chicago Press, 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

Museum purposes vary from institution to institution. Some favor education over conservation, or vice versa. For example, in the 1970s, the [[Canada Science and Technology Museum]] favored education over preservation of their objects. They displayed objects as well as their functions. One exhibit featured a historic printing press that a staff member used for visitors to create museum memorabilia.&lt;ref&gt;Babian, Sharon, ''CSTM: A History of the Canada Science and Technology Museum'', pp. 42–45&lt;/ref&gt;  Some seek to reach a wide audience, such as a national or state museum, while some museums have specific audiences, like the LDS [[Church History Museum]] or local history organizations. Generally speaking, museums collect objects of significance that comply with their mission statement for conservation and display.
Although most museums do not allow physical contact with the associated artifacts, there are some that are interactive and encourage a more hands-on approach. In 2009, [[Hampton Court Palace]], palace of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], opened the council room to the general public to create an interactive environment for visitors. Rather than allowing visitors to handle 500-year-old objects, the museum created replicas, as well as replica costumes. The daily activities, historic clothing, and even temperature changes immerse the visitor in a slice of what Tudor life may have been.&lt;ref&gt;Lipschomb, Suzannah, "Historical Authenticity and Interpretive Strategy at Hampton Court Palace," ''The Public Historian'' 32, no.3, August 2010, pp. 98–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early museums===

Early museums began as the private collections of wealthy individuals, families or institutions of art and rare or curious natural objects and [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]]. These were often displayed in so-called wonder rooms or [[cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]]. One of the oldest museums known is [[Ennigaldi-Nanna's museum]], built by Princess Ennigaldi at the end of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]]. The site dates from c. 530 BCE, and contained artifacts from earlier [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian civilizations]]. Notably, a clay drum label—written in three languages—was found at the site, referencing the history and discovery of a museum item.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/5805358/the-story-behind-the-worlds-oldest-museum-built-by-a-babylonian-princess-2500-years-ago|title=The story behind the world's oldest museum, built by a Babylonian princess 2,500 years ago|last=Wilkens|first=Alasdair|date=25 May 2011|website=io9|access-date=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manssour|first=Y. M.|last2=El-Daly|first2=H. M.|last3=Morsi|first3=N. K.|date=|title=The Historical Evolution of Museums Architecture|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/36076072/THE_HISTORICAL_EVOLUTION_OF_MUSEUM_ARCHITECTURE.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1522521609&amp;Signature=Fj5imIz0inyCc8%2BT8U1dFwShxoQ%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DTHE_HISTORICAL_EVOLUTION_OF_MUSEUMS_ARCH.pdf|journal=N/A|volume=|pages=2|via=Academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public access to these museums was often possible for the "respectable", especially to private art collections, but at the whim of the owner and his staff. One way that elite men during this time period gained a higher social status in the world of elites was by becoming a collector of these curious objects and displaying them. Many of the items in these collections were new discoveries and these collectors or naturalists, since many of these people held interest in natural sciences, were eager to obtain them. By putting their collections in a museum and on display, they not only got to show their fantastic finds but they also used the museum as a way to sort and "manage the empirical explosion of materials that wider dissemination of ancient texts, increased travel, voyages of discovery, and more systematic forms of communication and exchange had produced." &lt;ref&gt;Paula Findlen, Possessing Nature: Museums, Collecting, and Scientific Culture in Early Modern Italy (Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1994),3.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of these naturalists and collectors was [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]], whose collection policy of gathering as many objects and facts about them was "encyclopedic" in nature, reminiscent of that of Pliny, the Roman philosopher and naturalist.&lt;ref&gt;Paula Findlen, Possessing Nature: Museums, Collecting, and Scientific Culture in Early Modern Italy (Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1994),62.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was to consume and collect as much knowledge as possible, to put everything they collected and everything they knew in these displays. In time, however, museum philosophy would change and the encyclopedic nature of information that was so enjoyed by Aldrovandi and his cohorts would be dismissed as well as "the museums that contained this knowledge." The 18th-century scholars of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] saw their ideas of the museum as superior and based their natural history museums on "organization and taxonomy" rather than displaying everything in any order after the style of Aldrovandi.&lt;ref&gt;Paula Findlen, Possessing Nature: Museums, Collecting, and Scientific Culture in Early Modern Italy (Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1994),393–397.&lt;/ref&gt;

While some of the oldest public museums in the world opened in [[Italy]] during the [[Renaissance]], the majority of these significant museums in the world opened during the 18th century:
[[File:Das Ambraser Unterschloss.jpg|thumb|The Lower Castle of Ambras Castle, Innsbruck was one of the earliest buildings of all, explicitly intended for use as a museum, which still exists today in its proper function and shows the original collections.|alt=]]
* the [[Capitoline Museums]], the oldest public collection of art in the world, began in 1471 when [[Pope Sixtus IV]] donated a group of important ancient sculptures to the people of Rome.
* the [[Vatican Museums]], the second oldest museum in the world, traces its origins to the public displayed sculptural collection begun in 1506 by [[Pope Julius II]]
* [[Ambras Castle]] (''Schloss Ambras Innsbruck''), Austria, is not the oldest art collection, but it is the earliest collection still to be found in that very building created especially for its museum purpose (1572–1583, Supplement 1589): Ambras Castle is the oldest museum in the world in several respects: the oldest pair of original building and initial collections; the oldest preserved collection in the history of museum according to a systematic concept; it houses – beside the Armouries – the only Renaissance [[Chamber of Art and Curiosities, Ambras Castle|''Kunstkammer'']] of its kind to have been preserved at its original location. Verifiably called a ‘museum’ as early as c.1580.
* the [[Royal Armouries]] in the [[Tower of London]] is the oldest museum in the [[United Kingdom]]. It opened to the public in 1660, though there had been paying privileged visitors to the armouries displays from 1592. Today the museum has three sites including its new headquarters in [[Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalarmouries.org/collections/history-of-the-collection/museum-history/armouries-history/16th-17th-century |title=Royal Armouries Museum |publisher=Royalarmouries.org |date=29 December 1940 |accessdate=6 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704144038/http://www.royalarmouries.org/collections/history-of-the-collection/museum-history/armouries-history/16th-17th-century |archive-date=4 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Georg Eberhard Rumphius|Rumphius]] built a botanical museum in [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]] in 1662, making it the oldest recorded museum in [[Indonesia]].

Its successor was the [[Royal Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences|Batavia Society of Art and Science]], established on 24 April 1778. It built a museum and a library, played an important role in research, and collected much material on the natural history and culture of Indonesia.&lt;ref name="arch 29"&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |title=Cultural Policy in Indonesia |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0000/000058/005891eo.pdf |accessdate=17 February 2013 |year=1973 |publisher=UNESCO |location=Paris |isbn= |page= |pages=29–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Uffizi Palace (built 1560-1581) was designed by the Renaissance painter and architect [[Giorgio Vasari]]. The top floors were converted to gallery space, open to visitors on request, and then opened to the public as a museum in 1769 by Grand Duke Peter Leopold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = Uffizi.it|title=  History: The Uffizi|url =  https://www.uffizi.it/en/the-uffizi/history |deadurl = no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914214554/https://www.uffizi.it/en/the-uffizi/history |archivedate=14 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Online, s. v.

* the [[Museum of the History of Riga and Navigation]] is the oldest in Latvia and the whole of the Baltics, and one of the oldest in Europe. It was founded and opened to public in 1773 by the Riga Town Council as Himsel Museum. The rich and diverse collections of the museum originated from an art and natural sciences collection of Nikolaus von Himsel (1729–1764), a Riga doctor. Today the Museum of the History of Riga and Navigation collections number more than 500 000 items, systematised in about 80 collections.

===Modern museums===

Modern museums first emerged in western Europe, then spread into other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Chang Wan-Chen, ''A cross-cultural perspective on musealization: the museum’s
reception by China and Japan in the second half of the nineteenth century'' in ''Museum and Society'', vol 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first "public" museums were often accessible only by the middle and upper classes. It could be difficult to gain entrance. When the British Museum opened to the public in 1759, it was a concern that large crowds could damage the artifacts. Prospective visitors to the British Museum had to apply in writing for admission, and small groups were allowed into the galleries each day.&lt;ref&gt;The British Museum, " Admission Ticket to the British Museum" https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/archives/a/admission_ticket_to_the_britis.aspx, accessed 4/3/14.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Museum became increasingly popular during the 19th century, amongst all age groups and social classes who visited the British Museum, especially on public holidays.&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt;

The [[Ashmolean Museum]], however, founded in 1677 from the personal collection of [[Elias Ashmole]], was set up in the University of Oxford to be open to the public and is considered by some to be the first modern public museum.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, Marjorie (2001), Curiosities and Texts: The Culture of Collecting in Early Modern England, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press&lt;/ref&gt; The collection included that of [[Elias Ashmole]] which he had collected himself, including objects he had acquired from the gardeners, travellers and collectors [[John Tradescant the elder]] and [[John Tradescant the Younger|his son of the same name]]. The collection included antique coins, books, engravings, geological specimens, and zoological specimens—one of which was the stuffed body of the last [[dodo]] ever seen in Europe; but by 1755 the stuffed dodo was so moth-eaten that it was destroyed, except for its head and one claw. The museum opened on 24 May 1683, with [[natural history|naturalist]] [[Robert Plot]] as the first keeper. The first building, which became known as the [[Museum of the History of Science, Oxford|Old Ashmolean]], is sometimes attributed to [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]] or [[Thomas Wood (architect)|Thomas Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;H. E. Salter and Mary D. Lobel (editors) [[Victoria County History]] [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63866 ''A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 3'' 1954 Pages 47–49]&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the first public museum was the [[Louvre|Louvre Museum]] in [[Paris]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Louvre |url=http://www.louvre.fr/en/history-louvre |publisher=History of Louvre |accessdate=14 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024093225/http://www.louvre.fr/en/history-louvre |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; opened in 1793 during the [[French Revolution]], which enabled for the first time free access to the former French royal collections for people of all stations and status. The fabulous art treasures collected by the French monarchy over centuries were accessible to the public three days each "''décade''" (the 10-day unit which had replaced the week in the [[French Republican Calendar]]). The ''Conservatoire du muséum national des Arts'' (National Museum of Arts's Conservatory) was charged with organizing the Louvre as a national public museum and the centerpiece of a planned national museum system. As [[Napoleon|Napoléon I]] conquered the great cities of Europe, confiscating art objects as he went, the collections grew and the organizational task became more and more complicated. After Napoleon was defeated in 1815, many of the treasures he had amassed were gradually [[Repatriation (cultural heritage)|returned to their owners]] (and many were not). His plan was never fully realized, but his concept of a museum as an agent of nationalistic fervor had a profound influence throughout Europe.

Chinese and Japanese visitors to Europe were fascinated by the museums they saw there, but had cultural difficulties in grasping their purpose and finding an equivalent Chinese or Japanese term for them. Chinese visitors in the early 19th century named these museums based on what they contained, so defined them as "bone amassing buildings" or "courtyards of treasures" or "painting pavilions" or "curio stores" or "halls of military feats" or "gardens of everything". Japan first encountered Western museum institutions when it participated in Europe’s World’s Fairs in the 1860s. The British Museum was described by one of their delegates as a 'hakubutsukan', a 'house of extensive things' – this would eventually became accepted as the equivalent word for 'museum' in Japan and China.&lt;ref&gt;Chang Wan-Chen, ''A cross-cultural perspective on musealization: the museum’s reception by China and Japan in the second half of the nineteenth century'' in ''Museum and Society'', vol. 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

American museums eventually joined European museums as the world's leading centers for the production of new knowledge in their fields of interest. A period of intense museum building, in both an intellectual and physical sense was realized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (this is often called "The Museum Period" or "The Museum Age"). While many American museums, both natural history museums and art museums alike, were founded with the intention of focusing on the scientific discoveries and artistic developments in North America, many moved to emulate their European counterparts in certain ways (including the development of Classical collections from ancient [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Mesopotamia]], and [[ancient Rome|Rome]]). Drawing on [[Michel Foucault]]'s concept of liberal government, [[Tony Bennett (sociologist)|Tony Bennett]] has suggested the development of more modern 19th century museums was part of new strategies by Western governments to produce a citizenry that, rather than be directed by coercive or external forces, monitored and regulated its own conduct. To incorporate the masses in this strategy, the private space of museums that previously had been restricted and socially exclusive were made public.  As such, objects and artifacts, particularly those related to high culture, became instruments for these "new tasks of social management."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first =Tony |last =Bennett|title =The Birth of the Museum |location=New York|publisher = Routledge Press|date= 1995|pages = 6, 8, 24|isbn=0415053889}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[University|Universities]] became the primary centers for innovative research in the United States well before the start of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Nevertheless, museums to this day contribute new knowledge to their fields and continue to build collections that are useful for both research and display.

The late twentieth century witnessed intense debate concerning the repatriation of religious, ethnic, and cultural artifacts housed in museum collections. In the United States, several Native American tribes and advocacy groups have lobbied extensively for the repatriation of sacred objects and the reburial of human remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gulliford|first=Andrew|date=1992|title=Curation and Repatriation of Sacred and Tribal Artifacts|url=|journal=The Public Historian |volume= 14| issue = 3 |page=25|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Congress passed the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA), which required federal agencies and federally funded institutions to repatriate Native American "cultural items" to culturally affiliate tribes and groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/archeology/tools/laws/nagpra.htm|title=The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Park Service|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, many European museum collections often contain objects and cultural artifacts acquired through imperialism and colonization. Some historians and scholars have criticized the British Museum for its possession of rare antiquities from Egypt, Greece, and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duthie|first=Emily|date=2011|title=The British Museum: An Imperial Museum in a Post-Imperial World|url=|journal=Public History Review|volume=18 |pages=12–25|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The roles associated with the management of a museum largely depend on the size of the institution, but every museum has a hierarchy of governance with a Board of Trustees serving at the top. The Director is next in command and works with the Board to establish and fulfill the museum's mission statement and to ensure that the museum is accountable to the public.&lt;ref&gt;American Association of Museums, "The Accreditation Commission's Expectations Regarding Governance." [http://www.aam-us.org/aboutmuseums/standards/stbp.cfm p. 1.]&lt;/ref&gt;   Together, the Board and the Director establish a system of governance that is guided by policies that set standards for the institution. Documents that set these standards include an institutional or strategic plan, institutional code of ethics, bylaws, and collections policy. The [[American Alliance of Museums]] (AAM) has also formulated a series of standards and best practices that help guide the management of museums.
* [[Trustee|Board of Trustees]] – The board governs the museum and is responsible for ensuring the museum is financially and ethically sound. They set standards and policies for the museum. Board members are often involved in fundraising aspects of the museum and represent the institution.
* Director- The director is the face of the museum to the professional and public community. They communicate closely with the board to guide and govern the museum. They work with the staff to ensure the museum runs smoothly.

[[File:Perez Art Museum Miami.jpg|thumb|[[Pérez Art Museum Miami|Pérez Art Museum]] in [[Miami]], [[Florida]].]]
According to museum professionals Hugh H. Genoways and Lynne M. Ireland, "Administration of the organization requires skill in conflict management, interpersonal relations, budget management and monitoring, and staff supervision and evaluation. Managers must also set legal and ethical standards and maintain involvement in the museum profession."&lt;ref&gt;Hugh H. Genoways and Lynne M. Ireland, ''Museum Administration: An Introduction'', (Lanham: AltaMira, 2003), 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various positions within the museum carry out the policies established by the Board and the Director. All museum employees should work together toward the museum's institutional goal. Here is a list of positions commonly found at museums:
* [[Curator]] – Curators are the intellectual drivers behind exhibits. They research the museum's collection and topic of focus, develop exhibition themes, and publish their research aimed at either a public or academic audience. Larger museums have curators in a variety of areas. For example, [[The Henry Ford]] has a Curator of Transportation, a Curator of Public Life, a Curator of Decorative Arts, etc.
* [[Collection Management Policy|Collections Management]] – Collections managers are primarily responsible for the hands-on care, movement, and storage of objects. They are responsible for the accessibility of collections and collections policy.
* [[Registrar (museum)|Registrar]] – Registrars are the primary record keepers of the collection. They insure that objects are properly accessioned, documented, insured, and, when appropriate, loaned. Ethical and legal issues related to the collection are dealt with by registrars. Along with collections managers, they uphold the museum's collections policy.
* Educator – Museum educators are responsible for educating museum audiences. Their duties can include designing tours and public programs for children and adults, teacher training, developing classroom and continuing education resources, community outreach, and volunteer management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Knowledge to Narrative: Educators and the Changing  Museum|last=Roberts|first=Lisa C.|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educators not only work with the public, but also collaborate with other museum staff on exhibition and program development to ensure that exhibits are audience-friendly. 
* [[Exhibit Designer]] – Exhibit designers are in charge of the layout and physical installation of exhibits. They create a conceptual design and then bring it to fruition in the physical space.
* [[Conservator-restorer|Conservator]] – Conservators focus on object restoration. More than preserving the object in its present state, they seek to stabilize and repair artifacts to the condition of an earlier era.&lt;ref&gt;University of Rochester, [http://mag.rochester.edu/plugins/acrobat/teachers/MuseumCareers.pdf "Museum Job Descriptions".]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other positions commonly found at museums include: building operator, public programming staff, photographer, librarian, archivist, groundskeeper, volunteer coordinator, preparator, security staff, development officer, membership officer, business officer, gift shop manager, public relations staff, and graphic designer.

At smaller museums, staff members often fulfill multiple roles. Some of these positions are excluded entirely or may be carried out by a contractor when necessary.

===Exhibition histories===
{{globalize|date=April 2018}}
An '''exhibition history''' is a listing of exhibitions for an institution, artist, or a work of art. Exhibition histories generally include the name of the host institution, the title of the exhibition and the opening and closing dates of the exhibition.

The following is a list of major institutions that have complete or substantial exhibition histories that are available online.

==Museum planning==
[[File:Museu de Arte de Sao Paulo 1 Brasil.jpg|thumb|[[São Paulo Museum of Art]] in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]].]]
{{See also|Museum planning|Interpretive planning}}

The design of museums has evolved throughout history. However, museum planning involves planning the actual mission of the museum along with planning the space that the collection of the museum will be housed in. Intentional museum planning has its beginnings with the museum founder and librarian [[John Cotton Dana]]. Dana detailed the process of founding the Newark Museum in a series of books in the early 20th century so that other museum founders could plan their museums. Dana suggested that potential founders of museums should form a committee first, and reach out to the community for input as to what the museum should supply or do for the community.&lt;ref&gt;Dana, John Cotton. The New Museum (Woodstock, VT: The Elm Tree Press, 1917), 25.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dana, museums should be planned according to community's needs:

"The new museum…does not build on an educational superstition. It examines its community's life first, and then straightway bends its energies to supplying some the material which that community needs, and to making that material's presence widely known, and to presenting it in such a way as to secure it for the maximum of use and the maximum efficiency of that use." &lt;ref&gt;Dana, John Cotton. The New Museum (Woodstock, VT: The Elm Tree Press, 1917), 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The way that museums are planned and designed vary according to what collections they house, but overall, they adhere to planning a space that is easily accessed by the public and easily displays the chosen artifacts. These elements of planning have their roots with John Cotton Dana, who was perturbed at the historical placement of museums outside of cities, and in areas that were not easily accessed by the public, in gloomy European style buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Dana, John Cotton. The Gloom of the Museum. (Woodstock, VT: The Elm Tree Press, 1917), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions of accessibility continue to the present day. Many museums strive to make their buildings, programming, ideas, and collections more publicly accessible than in the past. Not every museum is participating in this trend, but that seems to be the trajectory of museums in the twenty-first century with its emphasis on inclusiveness. One pioneering way museums are attempting to make their collections more accessible is with open storage. Most of a museum's collection is typically locked away in a secure location to be preserved, but the result is most people never get to see the vast majority of collections. The Brooklyn Museum's Luce Center for American Art practices this open storage where the public can view items not on display, albeit with minimal interpretation. The practice of open storage is all part of an ongoing debate in the museum field of the role objects play and how accessible they should be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Turning Museums Inside-Out with Beautiful Visible Storage|url = http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/turning-museums-inside-out-with-beautiful-visible-storage|website = Atlas Obscura|date = 24 September 2014|access-date = 1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of modern museums, interpretive museums, as opposed to art museums, have missions reflecting curatorial guidance through the subject matter which now include content in the form of images, audio and visual effects, and interactive exhibits. Museum creation begins with a museum plan, created through a [[museum planning]] process. The process involves identifying the museum's vision and the resources, organization and experiences needed to realize this vision. A feasibility study, analysis of comparable facilities, and an [[Interpretive planning|interpretive plan]] are all developed as part of the museum planning process.

Some museum experiences have very few or no artifacts and do not necessarily call themselves museums, and their mission reflects this; the [[Griffith Observatory]] in [[Los Angeles]] and the [[National Constitution Center]] in [[Philadelphia]], being notable examples where there are few artifacts, but strong, memorable stories are told or information is interpreted. In contrast, the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] uses many artifacts in their memorable exhibitions.

===Financial uses of museums===
In recent years, some cities have turned to museums as an avenue for economic development or rejuvenation. This is particularly true in the case of postindustrial cities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Do Museums Still Need Objects?|last = Conn|first = Steven|publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press|year = 2010|isbn = |location = Philadelphia|pages = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of museums fulfilling these economic roles exist around the world. For example, the spectacular ''Guggenheim Bilbao'' was built in Bilbao, Spain in a move by the Basque regional government to revitalize the dilapidated old port area of that city. The Basque government agreed to pay $100 million for the construction of the museum, a price tag that caused many Bilbaoans to protest against the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = A Gleaming New Guggenheim for Grimy Bilbao|last = Riding|first = Alan|date = 24 June 1997|work = New York Times|access-date = |via = |page = C9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the gamble has appeared to pay off financially for the city, with over 1.1 million people visiting the museum in 2015. Key to this is the large demographic of foreign visitors to the museum, with 63% of the visitors residing outside of Spain and thus feeding foreign investment straight into Bilbao.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://prensa.guggenheim-bilbao.es/src/uploads/2016/01/NP_Balance-2015_ES.pdf|title = Guggenheim Bilbao Annual Report 2015|date = |access-date = 20 January 2016|website = Guggenheim Bilbao|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar project to that undertaken in Bilbao was also built on the disused shipyards of Belfast, Northern Ireland. ''Titanic Belfast'' was built for the same price as the ''Guggenheim Bilbao'' (and which was incidentally built by the same architect, Frank Gehry) in time for the 100th anniversary of the Belfast-built ship's maiden voyage in 2012. Initially expecting modest visitor numbers of 425,000 annually, first year visitor numbers reached over 800,000, with almost 60% coming from outside Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Northern Ireland Focus: Titanic Success Raises Hopes For Tourism|last = Smyth|first = Jamie|date = 16 June 2013|work = Financial Times|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, similar projects include the 81, 000 square foot ''Taubman Museum of Art'' in Roanoke, Virginia and ''The Broad Museum'' in Los Angeles.

Museums being used as a cultural economic driver by city and local governments has proven to be controversial among museum activists and local populations alike. Public protests have occurred in numerous cities which have tried to employ museums in this way. While most subside if a museum is successful, as happened in Bilbao, others continue especially if a museum struggles to attract visitors. The ''[[Taubman Museum of Art]]'' is an example of a museum which cost a lot (eventually $66 million) but attained little success, and continues to have a low endowment for its size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Start-Up Success Isn't Enough to Found a Museum|last = Wallis|first = David|date = 20 March 2014|work = New York Times|access-date = |via = |page = F6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some museum activists also see this method of museum use as a deeply flawed model for such institutions. Steven Conn, one such museum proponent, believes that "to ask museums to solve our political and economic problems is to set them up for inevitable failure and to set us (the visitor) up for inevitable disappointment."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Museum funding===

Museums are facing funding shortages. Funding for museums comes from four major categories, and as of 2009 the breakdown for the United States is as follows: Government support (at all levels) 24.4%, private (charitable) giving 36.5%, earned income 27.6%, and investment income 11.5%.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Ford W. [http://www.photos.state.gov/libraries/amgov/133183/english/P_You_Asked_How_Are_Museums_Supported_Financially.pdf “How Are Museums Supported Nationally in the U.S.?”] Embassy of the United States of America, 2012..  Accessed 26 March 2017.
&lt;/ref&gt; Government funding from the National Endowment for the Arts, the largest museum funder in the United States, decreased by 19.586 million between 2011 and 2015, adjusted for inflation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/2011-NEA-Annual-Report.pdf “National Endowment for the Arts 2011 Annual Report.”] National Endowment for the Arts, 2012. .  Accessed 26 February 2017.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/2015%20Annual%20Report.pdf “National Endowment for the Arts 2015 Annual Report.”] National Endowment for the Arts, 2016.. Accessed 26 February 2017.
&lt;/ref&gt; The average spent per visitor in an art museum in 2016 was $8 between admissions, store and restaurant, where the average expense per visitor was $55.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aamd.org/sites/default/files/document/Art%20Museums%20By%20the%20Numbers%202016.pdf Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD)], “Art Museums by the Numbers 2016.” AAMD.org,. Accessed 26 February 2017.
&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations, which fall into the private giving category, can be a good source of funding to make up the funding gap. The amount corporations currently give to museums accounts for just 5% of total funding.&lt;ref&gt;Stubbs, Ryan and Henry Clapp. [http://www.giarts.org/article/public-funding-arts-2015-update “Public Funding for the Arts: 2015 Update.”] Grantmakers in the Arts, GIA Reader, vol. 26, no. 3, Fall 2015.. Accessed 26 February 2017.
&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate giving to the arts, however, was set to increase by 3.3% in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Sponsorship Spending on the Arts to Grow 3.3 Percent in 2017|website = ESP Sponsorship Report|date = 13 February 2017|url = http://www.sponsorship.com/iegsr/2017/02/13/Sponsorship-Spending-On-The-Arts-To-Grow-3-3-Perce.aspx|publisher = ESP Properties, LLC.}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition design==
{{Main article|Exhibit design}}
[[File:Indonesia Museum Traditional Dress 01.jpg|thumb|Exhibit in [[Indonesia Museum]], [[Jakarta]], displaying the traditional costumes of [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|Indonesian ethnic groups]], such as [[Balinese people|Balinese]] and East Java.]]

Most mid-size and large museums employ [[exhibit design]] staff for graphic and environmental design projects, including exhibitions. In addition to traditional 2-D and 3-D designers and architects, these staff departments may include audio-visual specialists, software designers, audience research and evaluation specialists, writers, editors, and preparators or art handlers. These staff specialists may also be charged with supervising contract design or production services. The exhibit design process builds on the [[Interpretive planning|interpretive plan]] for an exhibit, determining the most effective, engaging and appropriate methods of communicating a message or telling a story. The process will often mirror the architectural process or schedule, moving from conceptual plan, through schematic design, design development, contract document, fabrication, and installation. Museums of all sizes may also contract the outside services of exhibit fabrication businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taheri|first=Babak|last2=Jafari|first2=Aliakbar|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin|title=Keeping your audience: Presenting a visitor engagement scale|journal=Tourism Management|volume=42|pages=321–329|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2013.12.011|year=2014|url=https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/46406/4/Taheri_Jafari_O_Gorman_Pre_Print_Draft.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exhibition design has as multitude of strategies, theories, and methods but two that embody much of the theory and dialogue surrounding exhibition design are the metonymy technique and the use of authentic artifacts to provide the historical narrative. Metonymy, or "the substitution of the name of an attribute or adjunct for that of the thing meant,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Oxford Dictionaries|metonymy}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a technique used by many museums but few as heavily and as influentially as Holocaust museums.

The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington D.C., for example, employs this technique in its shoe exhibition. Simply a pile of decaying leather shoes piled against a bare, gray concrete wall the exhibit relies heavily on the emotional, sensory response the viewer will naturally through this use metonymic technique. This exhibition design intentionally signifies metonymically the nameless and victims themselves. This metaphysical link to the victims through the deteriorating and aged shoes stands as a surviving vestige of the individual victim. This technique, employed properly, can be a very powerful one as it plays off the real life experiences of the viewer while evoking the equally unique memory of the victim. Metonymy, however, Jennifer Hansen-Glucklich argues, is not without its own problems. Hansen-Glucklich explains, "...when victims' possessions are collected according to type and displayed en masse they stand metonymically for the victims themselves ... Such a use of metonymy contributes to the dehumanization of the victims as they are reduced to a heap of indistinguishable objects and their individuality subsumed by an aesthetic of anonymity and excess."&lt;ref name="Hansen-Glucklich, J. 2011"&gt;Hansen-Glucklich, J. (2011). Holocaust Memories: Visuality and the Sacred in Museums and Exhibits Doctoral dissertation, UMI Dissertation Publishing, Ann Arbor&lt;/ref&gt;

While a powerful technique, Hansen-Glucklick points out that when used ''en masse'' the metonym suffers as the memory and suffering of the individual is lost in the chorus of the whole. While at times juxtaposed, the alternative technique of the use of authentic objects is seen the same exhibit mentioned above. The use of authentic artifacts is employed by most, if not all, museums but the degree to which and the intention can vary greatly. The basic idea behind exhibiting authentic artifacts is to provide not only legitimacy to the exhibit's historical narrative but, at times, to help create the narrative as well. The theory behind this technique is to exhibit artifacts in a neutral manner to orchestrate and narrate the historic narrative through, ideally, the provenance of the artifacts themselves.

While albeit necessary to some degree in any museum repertoire, the use of authentic artifacts can not only be misleading but as equally problematic as the aforementioned metonymic technique. Hansen-Glucklick explains, "The danger of such a strategy lies in the fact that by claiming to offer the remnants of the past to the spectator, the museum creates the illusion of standing before a complete picture. The suggestion is that if enough details and fragments are collected and displayed, a coherent and total truth concerning the past will emerge, visible and comprehensible. The museum attempts, in other words, to archive the unachievable."&lt;ref name="Hansen-Glucklich, J. 2011"/&gt; While any exhibit benefits from the legitimacy given by authentic objects or artifacts, the temptation must be protected against in order to avoid relying solely on the artifacts themselves. A well designed exhibition should employ objects and artifacts as a foundation to the narrative but not as a crutch; a lesson any conscientious curator would be well to keep in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hogg|first=Gill|last2=Liao|first2=Min-Hsiu|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin|title=Reading between the lines: Multidimensional translation in tourism consumption|journal=Tourism Management|volume=42|pages=157–164|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2013.10.005|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some museum scholars have even begun to question whether museums truly need artifacts at all. Historian Steven Conn provocatively asks this question, suggesting that there are fewer objects in ''all'' museums now, as they have been progressively replaced by interactive technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As educational programming has grown in museums, mass collections of objects have receded in importance. This is not necessarily a negative development. Dorothy Canfield Fisher observed that the reduction in objects has pushed museums to grow from institutions that artlessly showcased their many artifacts (in the style of early cabinets of curiosity) to instead "thinning out" the objects presented "for a general view of any given subject or period, and to put the rest away in archive-storage-rooms, where they could be consulted by students, the only people who really needed to see them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon of disappearing objects is especially present in science museums like the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in Chicago, which have a high visitorship of school-aged children who may benefit more from hands-on interactive technology than reading a label beside an artifact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Types==
[[File:Museodeloro (1).jpg|thumb|[[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Gold Museum]], [[Bogotá]] [[Colombia]].]]

Types of museums vary, from large institutions, covering many of the categories below, to very small institutions focusing on a specific subject, location, or a notable person. Categories include: [[fine art]]s, [[applied arts]], [[craft]], [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]] and [[ethnology]], [[biography]], [[history]], [[cultural history]], [[science]], [[technology]], [[children's museum]]s, [[natural history]], [[botanical garden|botanical]] and [[zoo|zoological gardens]]. Within these categories, many museums specialize further, e.g. museums of [[modern art]], folk art, local history, [[military history]], [[aviation]] history, [[philately]], [[agriculture]], or [[geology]]. Another type of museum is an encyclopedic museum. Commonly referred to as a universal museum, encyclopedic museums have collections representative of the world and typically include art, science, history, and cultural history. The type and size of a museum is reflected in its collection. A museum normally houses a core collection of important selected objects in its field.

===Architectural museums===
Architectural museums are institutions dedicated to educating visitors about architecture and a variety of related fields, often including urban design, landscape design, interior decoration, engineering, and historic preservation.  Additionally, museums of art or history sometimes dedicate a portion of the museum or a permanent exhibit to a particular facet or era of architecture and design, though this does not technically constitute a proper museum of architecture.

The [[International Confederation of Architectural Museums]] (ICAM) is the principal worldwide organisation for architectural museums.  Members consist of almost all large institutions specializing in this field and also those offering permanent exhibitions or dedicated galleries.

Architecture museums are in fact a less common type in the United States, due partly to the difficulty of curating a collection which could adequately represent or embody the large scale subject matter.

The National Building Museum in Washington D.C., a privately run institution created by a mandate of Congress in 1980, is the nation's most prominent public museum of architecture. In addition to its architectural exhibits and collections, the museum seeks to educate the public about engineering and design. The NBM is a unique museum in that the building in which it is housed—the historic Pension Building built 1882–87—is itself a sort of curated collection piece which teaches about architecture.  Another large scale museum of architecture is the Chicago Athenaeum, an international Museum of Architecture and Design, founded in 1988.  The Athenaeum differs from the National Building Museum not only in its global scope—it has offices in Italy, Greece, Germany, and Ireland—but also in its broader topical scope, which encompasses smaller modern appliances and graphic design.

A very different and much smaller example of an American architectural museum is the Schifferstadt Architectural Museum in Frederick, Maryland. Similar to the National Building Museum, the building of the Schifferstadt is a historic structure, built in 1758, and therefore also an embodiment of historic preservation and restoration.  In addition to instructing the public about its eighteenth century German-American style architecture, the Schifferstadt also interprets the broader contextual history of its origins, including topics such as the French and Indian War and the arrival of the region's earliest German American immigrants.

Museums of architecture are devoted primarily to disseminating knowledge about architecture, but there is considerable room for expanding into other related genres such as design, city planning, landscape, infrastructure, and even the traditional study of history or art, which can provide useful context for any architectural exhibit.

The American Society of Landscape Architects has professional awards given out every year to architectural museums and art displays. A few of the award-winning projects are:

===Archaeology museums===
Archaeology museums specialize in the display of archaeological artifacts. Many are in the open air, such as the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora of Athens]] and the [[Roman Forum]]. Others display artifacts found in archaeological sites inside buildings. Some, such as the [[Western Australian Museum]], exhibit maritime archaeological materials. These appear in its Shipwreck Galleries, a wing of the Maritime Museum. This Museum has also developed a  'museum-without-walls'  through a series of underwater wreck trails.

===Art museums===
{{Main article|Art museum}}
[[File:Uffizi Gallery - Michelangelo painting "Tondo Doni".JPG|thumb|right|Viewers of the ''[[Doni Tondo]]'' by [[Michelangelo]] in the [[Uffizi|Uffizi Gallery]].]]
An [[art museum]], also known as an art gallery, is a space for the exhibition of art, usually in the form of [[Work of art|art objects]]
from the [[visual arts]], primarily [[painting]]s, [[illustration]]s, and [[sculpture]]s. Collections of [[drawing]]s and [[old master print]]s are often not displayed on the walls, but kept in a [[print room]]. There may be collections of [[applied arts|applied art]], including [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[metalworking|metalwork]], furniture, [[artist's book]]s, and other types of objects. [[Video art]] is often screened.

The first publicly owned museum in [[Europe]] was the Amerbach-Cabinet in [[Basel]], originally a private collection sold to the city in 1661 and public since 1671 (now [[Kunstmuseum Basel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Marta C.|last =  Lourenço|title = A Contribution to the History of University Museums and Collections in Europe|publisher = ICOM Conference 2002|url =  http://publicus.culture.hu-berlin.de/umac/2002/lourenco.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford]] opened on 24 May 1683 as the world's first university art museum. Its first building was built in 1678–1683 to house the [[cabinet of curiosities]] [[Elias Ashmole]] gave [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] in 1677. The [[Uffizi]] Gallery in [[Florence]] was initially conceived as offices for the Florentine civil service (hence the name), but evolved into a display place for many of the paintings and sculpture collected by the [[House of Medici|Medici]] family or commissioned by them. After the house of Medici was extinguished, the art treasures remained in Florence, forming one of the first modern museums. The gallery had been open to visitors by request since the sixteenth century, and in 1765 it was officially opened to the public. Another early public museum was the [[British Museum]] in London, which opened to the public in 1759.&lt;ref name="BM"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/history/general_history.aspx |title=History of the British Museum |accessdate= |publisher=British Museum }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a "universal museum" with very varied collections covering art, applied art, archaeology, anthropology, history, and science, and what is now the [[British Library]]. The science collections, library, paintings, and modern sculptures have since been found separate homes, leaving history, archaeology, non-European and pre-Renaissance art, and prints and drawings. Underwater museum is another type of [[art museum]] where the [[Artificial reef]] are placed to promote marine life. [[Cancun Underwater Museum]], or the Subaquatic Sculpture Museum, in [[Mexico]] is the largest underwater museum in the world. There are now about 500 images in the underwater museum. The last eleven images were added in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://whatisusa.info/the-largest-underwater-museum-in-the-world/ |title=Largest underwater museum in the world |publisher=What is USA News |date=18 March 2014 |accessdate=16 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318092332/http://whatisusa.info/the-largest-underwater-museum-in-the-world/ |archivedate=18 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specialised art museum is considered a fairly modern [[invention]], the first being the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] which was established in 1764.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]] was established in 1793, soon after the French Revolution when the royal treasures were declared for the people.&lt;ref name="McClellan"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of California Press|isbn = 0-520-22176-1|pages=&amp;nbsp;14–20|last = McClellan| first = Andrew| title = Inventing the Louvre: Art, Politics, and the Origins of the Modern Museum...|year =1999|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UUxG3N-t750C&amp;dq=inventing+the+louvre+luxembourg+gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Czartoryski Museum]] in [[Kraków]] was established in 1796 by [[Izabela Czartoryska|Princess Izabela Czartoryska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.czartoryski.org/museum.htm |title=History of The Czartoryski Museum  |accessdate=5 April 2008 |work=Czartoryski }}&lt;/ref&gt; This showed the beginnings of removing art collections from the private domain of aristocracy and the wealthy into the public sphere, where they were seen as sites for educating the masses in taste and cultural refinement.

===Biographical museums===
{{mainlist|:Category: Biographical museums}}
Biographical museums are dedicated to items relating to the life of a single person or group of people, and may also display the items collected by their subjects during their lifetimes.  Some biographical museums are located in a house or other site associated with the lives of their subjects (e.g. [[Sagamore Hill (house)|Sagamore Hill]] which contains the Theodore Roosevelt Museum or The [[Keats-Shelley Memorial House]] in the [[Piazza di Spagna]], [[Rome]]). Some homes of famous people house famous collections in the sphere of the owner's expertise or interests in addition to collections of their biographical material; one such example is The [[Wellington Museum]], [[Apsley House]], [[London]], home of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], which, in addition to biographical memorabilia of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke]]'s life, also houses his collection world-famous paintings.  Other biographical museums, such as many of the American [[Presidential library|presidential libraries]], are housed in specially constructed buildings.

===Automobile Museums===
There are one hundred and seven automobile museums in the United States, one in Canada, and one in the Republic of Georgia{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} according to the National Association of Automobile Museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naam.museum/museum-list/|title = Museum list|website = National Association of Automobile Museums}}&lt;/ref&gt; Automobile Museums are for car fans, collectors, enthusiasts, and for families. “They speak to the imagination,” says Ken Gross, a former museum director who now curates auto exhibits at the fine arts museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/10greatplaces/2017/08/11/auto-museums/556458001/|title = 10 great auto museums worth a pit stop|work = USA Today|date = 11 August 2017|last = Bleiberg|first = Larry}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As time goes by, more and more museums dedicated to classic cars of yesteryear are opening. Many of the old classics come to life once the original owners pass away. Some are not-for-profit while others are run as a private business.

===Children's museums===
[[File:Buell Childrens Museum by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|The [[Buell Children's Museum]] in [[Pueblo, Colorado]] was ranked #2 children's art museum in the United States by ''Child Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gocolorado.com/Article.aspx?articleId=a479ebf9-0fe2-4238-912c-cccfc231f5bc&amp;type=Article Go Colorado article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621232812/http://www.gocolorado.com/Article.aspx?articleId=a479ebf9-0fe2-4238-912c-cccfc231f5bc&amp;type=Article |date=21 June 2008 }} that mentions that Buell Children's Museum was ranked second in the United States in 2002&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Children's museums are institutions that provide exhibits and programs to stimulate [[informal learning]] experiences for [[child]]ren. In contrast with traditional museums that typically have a hands-off policy regarding exhibits, children's museums feature interactive exhibits that are designed to be manipulated by children. The theory behind such exhibits is that activity can be as educational as instruction, especially in early childhood. Most children's museums are [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] organizations, and many are run by [[Volunteering|volunteers]] or by very small professional staffs.&lt;ref name="ACM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childrensmuseums.org/ |title=The Association of Children's Museums website |publisher=Childrensmuseums.org |date= |accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brooklyn Children's Museum]] was established in 1899 by the [[Brooklyn Museum|Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences]]. It is often regarded as the first children's museum in the United States.&lt;ref name="Herminia Weihsin Din 1998"&gt;Herminia Weihsin Din, "A History of Children's Museums in the United States, 1899–1997: Implications for Art Education and Museum Education in the United States," (dissertation, Ohio State University, 1998), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind the Brooklyn Children's Museum implicitly acknowledged that existing American museums were not designed with children in mind. Although museums at the turn of the century viewed themselves as institutions of public education, their exhibits were often not made accessible for children, who may have struggled with simple design features like the height of exhibit cases, or the language of interpretive labels.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa C. Roberts, ''From Knowledge to Narrative: Educators and the Changing Museum'' (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1997), 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, touching objects was often prohibited, limiting visitors' ability to interact with museum objects.

The founders of the Brooklyn Children's Museum were concerned with education and realized that no other institution had attempted to establish "a Museum that will be of especial value and interest to young people between the ages of six and twenty years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences|title =The Children's Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences|location=Brooklyn|date= 1900|page = 7|url = https://books.google.com/?id=4-hPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=a+Museum+that+will+be+of+especial+value+and+interest+to+young+people+between+the+ages+of+six+and+twenty+years#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20Museum%20that%20will%20be%20of%20especial%20value%20and%20interest%20to%20young%20people%20between%20the%20ages%20of%20six%20and%20twenty%20years&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their goal was to gain children's interest and "to stimulate their powers of observation and reflection" as well as to "illustrate by collections of pictures, cartoons, charts, models, maps and so on, each of the important branches of knowledge which is taught in elementary schools."&lt;ref name="Herminia Weihsin Din 1998"/&gt;

Anna Billings Gallup, the museum's curator from 1904 to 1937, encouraged a learning technique that allowed children to "discover" information by themselves through touching and examining objects. Visitors to the museum were able to compare the composition, weight, and hardness of minerals, learn to use a microscope to examine natural objects, and build their own collections of natural objects to be displayed in a special room of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Haven Schauffler, "The Children's Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, Brooklyn, New York," ''The American Midland Naturalist'', 9 no. 5/6 (1924): 209–216.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to emphasis on allowing interaction with objects, Gallup also encouraged learning through play. She believed learning at the Brooklyn Children's Museum should be "pure fun", and to this end developed nature clubs, held field trips, brought live animals into the museum, and hired gallery instructors to lead children in classification games about animals, shells, and minerals.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Haven Schauffler, "The Children's Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, Brooklyn, New York," ''The American Midland Naturalist'', 9 no. 5/6 (1924): 208, 210, 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Other children's museums of the early twentieth century used similar techniques that emphasized learning through experience.

Children's museums often emphasize experiential learning through museum interactives, sometimes leading them to have very few or no physical collection items. The Brooklyn Children's Museum and other early children's museums grew out of the tradition of natural history museums, object-centered institutions. Over the course of the twentieth century, the children's museums slowly began to discard their objects in favor of more interactive exhibits. While children's museums are a more extreme case, it is important to note that during the twentieth century, more and more museums have elected to display fewer objects and offer more interpretation than museums of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa C. Roberts, ''From Knowledge to Narrative: Educators and the Changing Museum'' (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1997), 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars argue that objects, while once critical to the definition of a museum, are no longer considered vital to many institutions because they are no longer necessary to fulfill the roles we expect museums to serve as museums focus more on programs, education, and their visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Do Museums Still Need Objects?|last=Conn|first=Steven|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Brooklyn Children's Museum opened in 1899, other American museums followed suit by opening small children's sections of their institutions designed with children in mind and equipped with interactive activities, such as the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]]'s children's room opened in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/blog/smithsonian-childrens-room |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302151744/http://siarchives.si.edu/blog/smithsonian-childrens-room |dead-url=no |archive-date=2 March 2016 |title=Knowledge Begins in Wonder: The Design Behind the Smithsonian Children's Room |last=Brady |first=Hillary |date=1 March 2016 |website=Smithsonian Institution Archives |publisher= |access-date=3 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brooklyn Children's Museum also inspired other children's museums either housed separately or even developed completely independently of parent museums, like the [[Boston Children's Museum]] (1913), The Children's Museum of Detroit Public Schools (1915), and the [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis|Children's Museum of Indianapolis]] (1925).&lt;ref&gt;Herminia Weihsin Din, "A History of Children's Museums in the United States, 1899–1997: Implications for Art Education and Museum Education in the United States," (dissertation, Ohio State University, 1998), 26–34.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of children's museums in the United States continued to grow over the course of the twentieth century, with over 40 museums opened by the 1960s and more than 70 children's museums opened to the public between 1990 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Herminia Weihsin Din, "A History of Children's Museums in the United States, 1899–1997: Implications for Art Education and Museum Education in the United States," (dissertation, Ohio State University, 1998), 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

International professional organizations of children's museums include the Association of Children's Museums (ACM), which was formed in 1962 as the American Association of Youth Museums (AAYM) and in 2007 counted 341 member institutions in 23 countries,&lt;ref name="ACM" /&gt; and The Hands On! Europe Association of Children's Museum (HO!E), established in 1994, with member institutions in 34 countries as of 2007.&lt;ref name="HO!E"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hands-on-europe.net/ |title=Hands On! Europe website |publisher=Hands-on-europe.net |date= |accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many museums that are members of ACM offer reciprocal memberships, allowing members of one museum to visit all the others for free.

===Design museums===

A [[design museum]] is a museum with a focus on [[Product (business)|product]], [[Industrial design|industrial]], [[Graphics|graphic]], [[fashion]], and [[Architecture|architectural]] design.
Many design museums were founded as museums for [[applied arts]] or [[decorative arts]] and started only in the late 20th century to collect [[design]].

===Diachronic versus synchronic===
It may sometimes be useful to distinguish between [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] and [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] museums.  According to [[University of Florida]]'s Professor Eric Kilgerman, "While a museum in which a particular narrative unfolds within its halls is diachronic, those museums that limit their space to a single experience are called synchronic."&lt;ref&gt;Kilgerman, Eric.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=r5TEsqmRfA8C&amp;pg=PA255 Sites of the Uncanny: Paul Celan, Specularity and the Visual Arts]'', p. 255 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encyclopedic museums===
Encyclopedic museums are large, mostly national, institutions that offer visitors a plethora of information on a variety of subjects that tell both local and global stories. The aim of encyclopedic museums is to provide examples of each classification available for a field of knowledge.   "When 3% of the world's population, or nearly 200 million people, living outside the country of their birth, encyclopedic museums play an especially important role in the building of civil society. They encourage curiosity about the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Season Preview—The Promise of Encyclopedic Museums |url=http://www.elginism.com/similar-cases/lecture-on-the-encyclopaedic-museum/20080823/1283/ |date = 25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[James Cuno]], President and Director of the Art Institute of Chicago, along with Neil MacGregor, Director of the British Museum, are two of the most outspoken museum professionals who support encyclopedic museums. They state that encyclopedic museums are advantageous for society by exposing museum visitors to a wide variety of cultures, engendering a sense of a shared human history.&lt;ref&gt;James Cuno, "Museums Matter: In Praise of the Encyclopedic Museum", 2013, The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars and archaeologists, however, argue against encyclopedic museums because they remove cultural objects from their original cultural setting, losing their context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malcolm|first=Bell III|title=Who's Right?

[[File:Museum Indonesia Main Building.jpg|thumb|[[Indonesia Museum]] in [[Taman Mini Indonesia Indah|TMII]] built in [[Balinese architecture]], is an ethnology museum displaying various artifacts and way of life of [[ethnic groups in Indonesia]].]]
Ethnology museums are a type of museum that focus on studying, collecting, preserving and displaying artifacts and objects concerning [[ethnology]] and [[anthropology]]. This type of museum usually were built in countries possessing diverse [[ethnic group]]s or significant numbers of ethnic minorities.  An example is the [[Ozurgeti History Museum]], an ethnographic museum in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

===Historic house museums===
{{Main article|Historic house museum}}

Within the category of history museums, historic house museums are the most numerous. The earliest projects for preserving historic homes began in the 1850s under the direction of individuals concerned with the public good and the preservation of American history, especially centered on the first president. Since the establishment of America's first historic site at Washington's Revolutionary headquarters at Hasbrouck House in New York State, Americans have found a penchant for preserving similar historical structures. The establishment of historic house museums increased in popularity through the 1970s and 1980s as the Revolutionary bicentennial set off a wave of patriotism and alerted Americans to the destruction of their physical heritage. The tradition of restoring homes of the past and designating them as museums draws on the English custom of preserving ancient buildings and monuments. Initially homes were considered worthy of saving because of their associations with important individuals, usually of the elite classes, like former presidents, authors, or businessmen. Increasingly, Americans have fought to preserve structures characteristic of a more typical American past that represents the lives of everyday people including minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butcher-Younghans|first=Sherry|title=Historic House Museums: A Practical Handbook for Their Care, Preservation, and Management|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=i, 1, 5.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chambre de la Reine du Petit Trianon 004.jpg|thumb|left|The queen's chamber in [[Petit Trianon]], former residence of [[Marie Antoinette]].]] 
While historic house museums compose the largest section within the historic museum category, they usually operate with small staffs and on limited budgets. Many are run entirely by volunteers and often do not meet the professional standards established by the museum industry. An independent survey conducted by Peggy Coats in 1990 revealed that sixty-five percent of historic house museums did not have a full-time staff and 19 to 27 percent of historic homes employed only one full-time employee. Furthermore, the majority of these museums operated on less than $50,000 annually. The survey also revealed a significant disparity in the number of visitors between local house museums and national sites. While museums like Mount Vernon and Colonial Williamsburg were visited by over one million tourists a year, more than fifty percent of historic house museums received less than 5,000 visitors per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coats|first=Peggy|title=Survey of Historic House Museums|journal=History News|year=1990|volume=45|issue=1|pages=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These museums are also unique in that the actual structure belongs to the museum collection as a historical object. While some historic home museums are fortunate to possess a collection containing many of the original furnishings once present in the home, many face the challenge of displaying a collection consistent with the historical structure. Some museums choose to collect pieces original to the period while not original to the house. Others, fill the home with replicas of the original pieces reconstructed with the help of historic records. Still other museums adopt a more aesthetic approach and use the homes to display the architecture and artistic objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hobbs|first=Stuart D.|title=Exhibiting Antimodernism: History, Memory, and the Aestheticized Past in Mid-twentieth century America|journal=The Public Historian|date=Summer 2001|volume=23|issue=3|pages=39|doi=10.1525/tph.2001.23.3.39}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Because historic homes have often existed through different generations and have been passed on from one family to another, volunteers and professionals also must decide which historical narrative to tell their visitors. Some museums grapple with this issue by displaying different eras in the home's history within different rooms or sections of the structure. Others choose one particular narrative, usually the one deemed most historically significant, and restore the home to that particular period.

===History museums===
[[File:Tutanchamon (js) 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The golden funerary mask of [[Tutankhamun]], [[Egyptian Museum]] of Cairo]]
[[:Category:History museums|History museums]] cover the knowledge of [[history]] and its relevance to the present and future. Some cover specialized curatorial aspects of history or a particular locality; others are more general. Such museums contain a wide range of objects, including documents, artifacts of all kinds, art, archaeological objects. [[:Category:Archaeological museums|Antiquities museums]] specialize in more archaeological findings.

A common type of history museum is a [[historic house]]. A historic house may be a building of special architectural interest, the birthplace or home of a famous person, or a house with an interesting history. Local and national governments often create museums to their history.  The United States has many national museums for historical topics, such as the National Museum of African American History and Culture.  [[Historic site]]s can also serve as museums, such as the museum at Ford's Theater in Washington D.C.  The U.S. National Park Service defines a historic site as the "location of a significant event, a prehistoric or historic occupation or activity, or a building or structure, whether standing, ruined, or vanished, where the location itself possesses historic, cultural, or archeological value regardless of the value of any existing structure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = National Register Bulletin: How to Complete the National Register Registration Form: Appendix IV: Glossary of National Register Terms|publisher =  U.S. Department of the Interior|website =  National Park Service|url =  http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/publications/bulletins/nrb16a/nrb16a_appendix_IV.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Iron bed in Tuol Sleng prison.JPG|thumb|left|Iron bed in [[torture]] room at [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]]]]
Historic sites can also mark [[Public-order crime|public crimes]], such as [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]] in Phnom Penh, Cambodia or Robben Island, South Africa.   Similar to museums focused on public crimes, museums attached to memorials of public crimes often contain a history component, as is the case at the Oklahoma City National Memorial &amp; Museum.  History museums may concern more general crimes and atrocities, such as American slavery.  Often these museums are connected to a particular example, such as the proposed International African American Museum in Charleston, South Carolina, which will treat slavery as an institution with a particular focus on slavery in Charleston and South Carolina's Lowcountry.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://iaamuseum.org/about/intro/|website = International African American Museum |title=Intro |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Museums in cities like Charleston, South Carolina must interact with a broader heritage tourism industry where the history of the majority population is traditionally privileged over the minority.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie E. Yuhl, A Golden Haze of Memory: The Making of Historic Charleston (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2005), 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Fitzhugh Brundage, The Southern Past: A Clash of Race and Memory (Cambridge: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2005), 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many specialized museums have been established such as the [[National LGBT Museum]] in New York City and the National Women's History Museum planned for the National Mall. The majority of museums across the country that tell state and local history also follow this example.Other museums have a problem interpreting colonial histories, especially at Native American historic sites. However, museums such as the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] and Ziibiwing Center of Anishinabe Culture and Lifeways in Michigan are working to share authority with indigenous groups and decolonize museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Decolonizing Museums: Representing Native America in National and Tribal Museums|last=Lonetree|first=Amy|publisher=University of North Carolina|year=2012|isbn=|location=Chapel Hill|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of history museum is a living history museum. A living history museum is an outdoor museum featuring reenactors in period costume, and historic or reconstructed buildings. Colonial Williamsburg is a living history museum in Virginia that represents the colony on the eve of the American Revolution in the 18th century. The 301 acre historic area includes hundreds of buildings, in their original locations, but mostly reconstructed.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Williamsburg, "That the Future May Learn From the Past", http://www.history.org/foundation/mission.cfm, accessed 4-3-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Living museum}}
Living history museums combine historic architecture, material culture, and costumed interpretation with natural and cultural landscapes to create an immersive learning environment. These museums include the collection, preservation or interpretation of material culture, traditional skills, and historical processes. Recreated historical settings simulating past time periods can offer the visitor a sense of traveling back in time. They are a type of open-air museum.

Two main interpretation styles dominate the visitor experience at living history museums: first and third person interpretation. In first person interpretation, interpreters assume the persona, including the speech patterns, behaviors, views, and dress of a historical figure from the museum's designated time period. In third person interpretation, the interpreters openly acknowledge themselves to be a contemporary of the museum visitor. The interpreter is not restricted by being in-character and can speak to the visitor about society from a modern-day perspective.

The beginnings of the living history museum can be traced back to 1873 with the opening of the [[Skansen]] Museum near Stockholm, Sweden. The museum's founder, [[Artur Hazelius]], began the museum by using his personal collection of buildings and other cultural materials of pre-industrial society.&lt;ref name="Living History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alhfam.org/?cat_id=153&amp;nav_tree=153 |title=Living History |publisher=The Association for Living History, Farm, and Agricultural Museums |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This museum began as an open-air museum and, by 1891, had several farm buildings in which visitors could see exhibits and where guides demonstrated crafts and tools.&lt;ref name="Leiterman 1983 14"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leiterman |first=Eloise Lee |title=The Pros and Cons of "Living History" and some of the unpredictable hazards |journal=Christian Science Monitor |volume=1 |date=1 August 1983 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For years, living history museums were relatively nonexistent outside of [[Scandinavia]], though some military garrisons in North America used some living history techniques. Living history museums in the United States were initially established by entrepreneurs, such as [[John D. Rockefeller]] and [[Henry Ford]], and since then have proliferated within the museum world. Some of the earliest living history museums in the United States include [[Colonial Williamsburg]] (1926), [[Greenfield Village]] (1929), [[Conner Prairie]] Pioneer Settlement (1930s), [[Old Sturbridge Village]] (1946), and [[Plimoth Plantation]] (1947). Many living history farms and similar farm and agricultural museums have united under an association known as the Association for Living History, Farm, and Agricultural Museums (ALHFAM).&lt;ref name="Living History"/&gt;

===Maritime museums===
[[File:PolandSzczecinPanorama.JPG|thumb|[[National Museum, Szczecin|Maritime Museum]] in [[Szczecin]], [[Poland]].]]
{{Main article|Maritime museum}}
[[Maritime museum]]s are museums that specialize in the presentation of maritime history, culture, or archaeology. They explore the relationship between societies and certain bodies of water. Just as there is a wide variety of museum types, there are also many different types of maritime museums. First, as mentioned above, maritime museums can be primarily archaeological. These museums focus on the interpretation and preservation of shipwrecks and other artifacts recovered from a maritime setting. A second type is the maritime history museum, dedicated to educating the public about humanity's maritime past. Examples are the [[San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park]] and [[Mystic Seaport]]. Military-focused maritime museums are a third variety, of which the [[Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum]] and [[USS Iowa Museum|Battleship IOWA Museum]] are examples.

===Medical museums===
{{See also|Medical History Museum (disambiguation){{!}}Medical History Museum}}
[[File:Museum of Medical Humanities.JPG|thumb|[[Museum of Medical Humanities]] in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]].]]
Medical museums today are largely an extinct subtype of museum with a few notable exceptions, such as the [[Mütter Museum]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the [[Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons]] in Glasgow, Scotland. The origins of the medical museum date back to [[Renaissance]] [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]] which often featured displays of human skeletal material and other [[materia medica]]. Apothecaries and physicians collected specimens as a part of their professional activities and to increase their professional status among their peers.&lt;ref name="Findlen 1994 246"&gt;{{cite book|last=Findlen|first=Paula|title=Possessing Nature: Museums, Collecting, and Scientific Culture in Early Modern Italy|date=1994|publisher=Regents of the University of California|place=Berkeley and Los Angeles|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the medical profession placed greater emphasis on teaching and the practice of materia medica in the late 16th century, medical collections became a fundamental component of a medical student's education.&lt;ref name="Findlen 1994 246"/&gt; New developments in preserving soft tissue samples long term in spirits appeared in the 17th century, and by the mid-18th century physicians like [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] were using personal anatomical collections as teaching tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alberti|first=Sam|title=Medical Museums: Past, Present, and Future|journal=The Royal College of Surgeons of England Bulletin|volume=93|issue=2|date=2011|page=56|doi=10.1308/147363511x552548}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 19th century, many hospitals and medical colleges in Great Britain had built sizable teaching collections. In the United States, the nation's first hospital, the Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, already had a collection of plaster casts and crayon drawings of the stages of pregnancy as early as 1762.&lt;ref name="McLeary 2000 599"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLeary|first=Erin|title=The Mütter Museum: Preservation, Education, and Commemoration|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=132|issue=7|date=2000|page=599|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-132-7-200004040-00033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical museums functioned as an integral part of medical students education through the 19th century and into the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="McLeary 2000 599"/&gt; Dry and wet anatomical specimens, casts, drawings, oil paintings, and photographs provided a means for medical students to compare healthy anatomical specimens with abnormal, or diseased organs. Museums, like the Mütter, added medical instruments and equipment to their collections to preserve and teach the history of the medical profession. By the 1920s, medical museums had reached their nadir and began to wane in their importance as institutes of medical knowledge and training. Medical teaching shifted towards training medical students in hospitals and laboratories, and over the course of the 20th century most medical museums disappeared from the museum horizon. The few surviving medical museums, like the Mütter Museum, have managed to survive by broadening their mission of preserving and disseminating medical knowledge to include the general public, rather than exclusively catering to medical professionals.

===Memorial museums===
[[File:9-11 Memorial South Pool.jpg|thumb|[[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum]] in [[New York City]].]]
Memorial museums are museums dedicated both to educating the public about and commemorating a specific historic event, usually involving mass suffering. The concept gained traction throughout the 20th century as a response to the numerous and well publicized mass atrocities committed during that century. The events commemorated by memorial museums tend to involve mostly civilian victims who died under "morally problematic circumstances" that cannot easily be interpreted as heroic. There are frequently unresolved issues concerning the identity, culpability, and punishment of the perpetrators of these killings and memorial museums often play an active research role aimed at benefiting both the victims and those prosecuting the perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Paul|title=Memorial Museums: the Global Rush to Commemorate Atrocities|date=2007|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=9781845204891|pages=8; 20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today there are numerous prominent memorial museums including the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], the [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum|Toul Sleng Museum of Genocidal Crimes in Phnom Penh, Cambodia]], the [[District Six Museum]] in Cape Town, South Africa, and the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum]] in [[New York City]]. Although the concept of a memorial museum is largely a product of the 20th century, there are museums of this type that focus on events from other periods, an example being the [[House of Slaves (Gorée)|House of Slaves (Maisons des Esclaves)]] in Senegal which was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1978 and acts as a museum and memorial to the Atlantic slave trade.

Memorial museums differ from traditional history museums in several key ways, most notably in their dual mission to incorporate both a moral framework for and contextual explanations of an event. While traditional history museums tend to be in neutral institutional settings, memorial museums are very often situated at the scene of the atrocity they seek to commemorate. Memorial museums also often have close connections with, and advocate for, a specific clientele who have a special relationship to the event or its victims, such as family members or survivors, and regularly hold politically significant special events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Paul|title=Memorial Museums: the Global Rush to Commemorate Atrocities|date=2007|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=9781845204891|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike many traditional history museums, memorial museums almost always have a distinct, overt political and moral message with direct ties to contemporary society. The following mission statement of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] is typical in its focus on commemoration, education and advocacy:

"The museum's primary mission is to advance and disseminate knowledge about this unprecedented tragedy; to preserve the memory of those who suffered; and to encourage its visitors to reflect upon the moral and spiritual questions raised by the events of the Holocaust as well as their own responsibilities as citizens of a democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Statement USHMM |url=http://www.ushmm.org/information/about-the-museum/mission-statement |accessdate=29 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519154448/http://www.ushmm.org/information/about-the-museum/mission-statement |archivedate=19 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military and war museums{{anchor|military museum}} &lt;!-- multiple articles direct to this anchor --&gt;===
[[File:Canadianwarmuseummgs.jpg|thumb|The [[Canadian War Museum]].]]
{{Category see also|Military and war museums}}
Military museums specialize in military histories; they are often organized from a national point of view, where a museum in a particular country will have displays organized around conflicts in which that country has taken part. They typically include displays of [[weapon]]s and other military equipment, [[Military uniform|uniforms]], wartime [[propaganda]], and exhibits on civilian life during wartime, and [[Military orders, awards and decorations|decorations]], among others. A military museum may be dedicated to a particular or area, such as the [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]] for military [[aircraft]], [[German Tank Museum|Deutsches Panzermuseum]] for [[tank]]s, the [[Lange Max Museum]] for the [[Western Front (World War I)]], the [[International Spy Museum]] for espionage, [[Liberty Memorial#The National World War I Museum|The National World War I Museum]] for [[World War I]], the [[D-Day Paratroopers Historical Center]] (Normandy) for WWII airborne, or more generalist, such as the [[Canadian War Museum]] or the [[Musée de l'Armée]].
For the Italian alpine wall one can find the most popular museum of bunkers in the small museum [https://www.n8bunker.com/ n8bunker] at Olang / Kronplatz in the heard of the dolomites of [[South Tyrol]].

===Mobile museums===
'''Mobile museum''' is a term applied to museums that make exhibitions from a vehicle- such as a van. Some institutions, such as [[St. Vital Historical Society]] and the [[Walker Art Center]], use the term to refer to a portion of their collection that travels to sites away from the museum for educational purposes. Other mobile museums have no "home site", and use travel as their exclusive means of presentation. University of Louisiana in Lafayette has also created a mobile museum as part of the graduate program in History. The project is called [[Museum on the Move]].

===Natural history museums===

[[File:National Museum of Natural History.jpg|thumb|right|The [[National Museum of Natural History]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
{{mainlist|List of natural history museums}}
Museums of [[natural history]] and [[natural science]] typically exhibit work of the natural world. The focus lies on nature and culture. Exhibitions educate the public on natural history, dinosaurs, zoology, oceanography, anthropology, and more. Evolution, environmental issues, and biodiversity are major areas in natural science museums. Notable museums include the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in [[London]], the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]] in [[Oxford]], the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Muséum national d'histoire naturelle]] in [[Paris]], the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of Natural History]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City]], and the [[Canadian Museum of Nature]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].

===Open-air museums===
{{Main article|Open-air museum}}
[[File:Oscar1888.jpg|thumb|The open-air museum of King [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]] at [[Bygdøy]] near [[Oslo]] in the museum guide of 1888. The World's first open-air museum was founded in 1881.]]
[[File:Farmhouse museum.JPG|thumb|An old [[farmhouse]] at the ''Salzburger Freilichtmuseum'' in Großgmain near [[Salzburg]].]]
[[Open-air museum]]s collect and re-erect old buildings at large outdoor sites, usually in settings of re-created landscapes of the past. The first one was [[Oscar II of Sweden|King Oscar II]]'s collection near [[Oslo]] in [[Norway]], opened in 1881. In 1907, it was incorporated into the [[Norwegian Museum of Cultural History|Norsk Folkemuseum]].&lt;ref&gt;Roede, Lars (1993). "The Open-air Museum Idea. An Early Contribution". ''Conference Report of the Association of European Open Air Museums 1991.'' Stockholm&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1891, inspired by a visit to the open-air museum in Oslo, [[Artur Hazelius]] founded the [[Skansen]] in [[Stockholm]], which became the model for subsequent open-air museums in [[Northern Europe|Northern]] and [[Eastern Europe]], and eventually in other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Rentzhog, Sten (2007).

===Pop-up museums===
A concept developed in the 1990s, the pop-up museum is generally defined as a short term institution existing in a temporary space.&lt;ref name="museum 2.0"&gt;[http://museumtwo.blogspot.com/2011/11/radical-simple-formula-for-pop-up.html Simon, Nina K.], Museum 2.0 blog re: pop-up museums, their construction, and usefulness within the profession.&lt;/ref&gt; These temporary museums are finding increasing favor among more progressive museum professionals as a means of direct community involvement with objects and exhibition. Often, the pop-up concept relies solely on visitors to provide both the objects on display and the accompanying labels with the professionals or institution providing only the theme of the pop-up and the space in which to display the objects, an example of [[shared historical authority]]. Due to the flexibility of the pop-up museums and their rejection of traditional structure, even these latter provisions need not be supplied by an institution; in some cases the themes have been chosen collectively by a committee of interested participants while exhibitions designated as pop-ups have been mounted in places as varied as community centers and even a walk-in closet.&lt;ref name="MONA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detroitmona.com/mona_pop-up_museum.htm|title=MONA: A Pop-Up Museum|publisher=|accessdate=4 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923213916/http://www.detroitmona.com/mona_pop-up_museum.htm|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some examples of pop-up museums include:
* [[Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History]] (MAH), which currently hosts collaborative Pop Up Museums around Santa Cruz County.
* [[Museum of New Art]] (MONA) – founded in Detroit, Michigan in 1996 this contemporary art museum is generally acknowledged to be the pioneer of the concept of the pop-up museum.&lt;ref name="MONA" /&gt;
* [[The Pop-Up Museum of Queer History]] – a series of pop-up museum events held at various sites across the United States focusing on the history and stories of local LGBT communities.&lt;ref name="Queer Museum"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.queermuseum.com/|deadurl=no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180825185715/http://www.queermuseum.com/|archivedate = 25 August 2018|title = Pop-Up Museum of Queer History website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science museums===
{{mainlist|List of science museums}}
[[File:MSIChicago.JPG|thumb|left|[[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in [[Chicago]].]]
[[Science museum]]s and technology centers or [[technology museum]]s revolve around scientific achievements, and marvels and their history. To explain complicated inventions, a combination of demonstrations, interactive programs and thought-provoking media are used. Some museums may have exhibits on topics such as [[computer]]s, [[aviation]], [[List of railway museums|railway museums]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]], and the [[animal|animal kingdom]]. The [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in [[Chicago]] is a very popular museum.

Science museums traditionally emphasize cultural heritage through objects of intrinsic value, echoes of the 'curiosity cabinets' of the Renaissance period. These early museums of science represented a fascination with collecting which emerged in the fifteenth century from 'an attempt to manage the empirical explosion of materials that wider dissemination of ancient texts, increased travel, voyages of discovery, and more systematic forms of communication and exchange had produced.&lt;ref&gt;Findlen, P. (1994) Possessing nature: Museums, collecting, and scientific culture in early modern Italy. Los Angeles: University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Science museums were institutions of authoritative, uncontestable, knowledge, places of 'collecting, seeing and knowing, places where "anybody" might come and survey the evidence of science.&lt;ref name="MACDONALD, S. 1998"&gt;MacDonald, S. (Ed.) (1998) The politics of display: Museums, science, culture. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Dinosaurs, extensive invertebrate and vertebrate collections, plant taxonomies, and so on – these were the orders of the day. By the nineteenth century, science museums had flourished, and with it 'the capacity of exhibitionary representation to render the world as visible and ordered... part of the instantiation of wider senses of scientific and political certainty' (MacDonald, 1998: 11). By the twentieth century, museums of science had built 'on their earlier emphasis on public education to present themselves as experts in the mediation between the obscure world of science and that of the public.&lt;ref name="MACDONALD, S. 1998"/&gt;
[[File:Diplodocus Minnesota Science Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Diplodocus fossil exhibit in [[Minnesota Science Museum]].]]
The nineteenth century also brought a proliferation of science museums with roots in technical and industrial heritage museums.&lt;ref name = rennie&gt;Rennie, L.J. &amp; McClafferty, T. (1996) Science centers and science learning. Studies in Science Education, 27, 53–98.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ordinarily, visitors individually interact with exhibits, by a combination of manipulating, reading, pushing, pulling, and generally using their senses. Information is carefully structured through engaging, interactive displays. Science centers include interactive exhibits that respond to the visitor's action and invite further response, as well as hands-on exhibits that do not offer feedback to the visitor,&lt;ref name = rennie/&gt; In general, science centers offer 'a decontextualized scattering of interactive exhibits, which can be thought of as exploring stations of ideas &lt;ref&gt;McManus, P. (1992) Topics in museums and science education. Studies in Science Education, 20, 157–182.&lt;/ref&gt; usually presented in small rooms or galleries, with scant attention paid to applications of science, social political contexts, or moral and ethical implications.

By the 1960s, these interactive science centers with their specialized hands-on galleries became prevalent. The [[Exploratorium]] in San Francisco, and the [[Ontario Science Centre]] in 1969, were two of the earliest examples of science centers dedicated to exploring scientific principles through hands-on exhibits. In the United States practically every major city has a science center with a total annual visitation of 115 million &lt;ref&gt;Koster, E.H. (1999) In search of relevance: Science centers as innovators in the evolution of museums. Daedalus, 28(3), 277–296.&lt;/ref&gt; New technologies of display and new interpretive experiments mark these interactive science centers, and the mantra 'public understanding of science' aptly describes their central activity.&lt;ref name="MACDONALD, S. 1998"/&gt;

Science museums, in particular, may consist of [[planetarium|planetaria]], or large theatre usually built around a dome. Museums may have [[IMAX]] feature films, which may provide [[3D film|3-D]] viewing or higher quality picture. As a result, IMAX content provides a more immersive experience for people of all ages.

Also new virtual museums, known as ''Net Museums'', have recently been created. These are usually websites belonging to real museums and containing photo galleries of items found in those real museums. This new presentation is very useful for people living far away who wish to see the contents of these museums.

===Specialized museums===
[[File:Cuckooland Museum clocks by Kirsty Davies.jpg|thumb|upright|Antique cuckoo clocks in the interior of [[Cuckooland Museum]].]]

A number of different museums exist to demonstrate a variety of topics. Music museums may celebrate the life and work of [[Lists of composers|composers]] or [[musician]]s, such as the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], or even the [[Rimsky-Korsakov Apartment and Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. Other music museums include live music recitals, such as the [[Handel House Museum]] in [[London]], [[England]].

In [[Glendale, Arizona]], the Bead Museum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beadmuseumaz.org/ |title=The Bead Museum |publisher=Beadmuseumaz.org |date= |accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  fosters an appreciation and understanding of the global, historical, cultural, and artistic significance of beads and related artifacts dating as far back as 15,000 years. Also residing in the American Southwest are living history towns such as [[Tombstone, Arizona]]. This historical town is home to a number of "living history" museums (such as the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral|O.K. Corral]] and the [[The Tombstone Epitaph|Tombstone Epitaph]]) in which visitors can learn about historical events from actors playing the parts of historical figures like [[Wyatt Earp]], [[Doc Holliday]], and [[John Clum]]. [[Colonial Williamsburg]] (in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]]), is another great example of a town devoted to preserving the story of America through reenactment.

[[File:AIG museum.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Creation Museum]] is a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[creationism]] museum run by [[Answers in Genesis]].]]
[[South Korea]] is host to the world's first museum devoted to the history and development of [[organic farming]], the [[Namyangju]] Organic Museum, with exhibit captions in both Korean and English, and which opened in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://orgprints.org/20571/1/Paull2011JBDT.NamyangjuMuseum.pdf  "A Postcard from Korea: Worldʼs First Organic Agriculture Museum"], Journal of Bio-Dynamics Tasmania, 104:11–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[No Show Museum]], based in Zurich and Johannesburg, is the world's first museum dedicated to nothing and its various manifestations throughout the history of art.

Museums targeted for youth, such as [[children's museum]]s or [[toy museum]]s in many parts of the world, often exhibit interactive and educational material on a wide array of topics, for example, the [[Museum of Toys and Automata]] in Spain. The [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]] and the "Borusseum", the museum about [[Borussia Dortmund]] in [[Dortmund]], [[Germany]], are institutions of the sports category. The [[Corning Museum of Glass]] is devoted to the art, history, and science of [[glass]]. The [[National Museum of Crime &amp; Punishment]] explores the science of solving crimes. The Great American Dollhouse Museum in Danville, Kentucky, depicts American social history in miniature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedollhousemuseum.com |title=The Great American Dollhouse Museum |publisher=Thedollhousemuseum.com |date= |accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Interpretation centre]]s are modern museums or visitors centres that often use new means of communication with the public. In some cases, museums cover an extremely wide range of topics together, such as the [[Museum of World Treasures]] in Wichita, KS. In other instances, museums emphasize regional culture and natural history, such as the [[Regional Museum of the National University of San Martin]], Tarapoto, [[Peru]]. The [[Museum of Salt and Pepper Shakers]] shows the history and variety of an everyday item.

===Virtual museums===
A development, with the expansion of the [[World Wide Web|web]], is the establishment of [[virtual museum]]s and online exhibitions. Online initiatives like the [[Virtual Museum of Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca |title=Virtual Museum of Canada – Musée virtuel du Canada |accessdate=5 April 2008 |work=virtualmuseum.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] provide physical museums with a web presence. Online [[curatorial platform]]s such as Rhizome&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rhizome.org |title=Rhizome |accessdate=5 April 2008 |work=Rhizome }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Archive of Digital Art (ADA)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalartarchive.at/nc/home.html|title= ADA {{!}} Archive of Digital Art|website=www.digitalartarchive.at|language=en-EN|access-date=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed online exhibitions that transform the museal experience within the digital space.

Some virtual museums have no counterpart in the real world, such as LIMAC (Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Lima),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://li-mac.org/ |title=LiMAC – Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Lima |accessdate=5 April 2008 |work=LiMAC }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has no physical location and might be confused with the city's own museum. The art historian [[Griselda Pollock]] elaborated a virtual [[feminism|feminist]] museum, spreading between classical art to contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum |last=Pollock |first=Griselda |authorlink=Griselda Pollock |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=0415413745 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some real life museums are also using the internet for virtual tours and exhibitions. In 2010, the [[Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney Museum]] in New York organized what it called the first ever online Twitter museum tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.whitney.org/Events/2010BiennialTwitterTour | title=Biennial Twitter Tour | publisher=[[Whitney Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoological parks and botanic gardens===
[[File:SDZooSign.jpg|thumb|Zoos are considered "living museums". This is the entrance of the [[San Diego Zoo]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]].]]
{{Main article|Zoo}}
{{Main article|Botanical garden}}
Although zoos and botanical gardens are not often thought of as museums, they are in fact "living museums". They exist for the same purpose as other museums: to educate, inspire action, and to study, develop, and manage collections. They are also managed much like other museums and face the same challenges. Notable zoos include the [[San Diego Zoo]], the [[London Zoo]], [[Brookfield Zoo]] at Chicago, [[Berlin Zoological Garden]], the [[Bronx Zoo]] in New York City, [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden]], [[Jardin des Plantes]] in [[Paris]], and [[Zürich Zoologischer Garten]] in [[Switzerland]]. Notable botanic gardens include [[The New York Botanical Garden]], [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]], [[Chicago Botanic Garden]], [[Taipei Botanical Garden]], and [[Royal Botanical Gardens (Ontario)]].

The '''National Research Centre on Equines (NRCE)''' was established during 7th five-year plan under the aegis of [[Indian Council of Agricultural Research]] for research on [[Horse|equine]] health and production considering the importance of equines in [[India]].

==History==
After the initial joining of the Project Director at ICAR headquarters on 26 November 1985, the Centre became operational at [[Hisar, Haryana|Hisar]] on 7 January 1986 for conducting researches and for providing effective health coverage for equines.

==Bikaner Campus==
The National Research Centre on equines, Bikaner Campus was established on September 28, 1989 for conducting research for improving the technologies for optimization of production potential of the equines. The campus has state-of-art laboratories for conducting research in equine genetics, nutrition, medicine, reproduction and management. The Centre has the responsibility on generation of technologies for augmenting equine performance in order to uplift the socio-economic status of poor equine owners. Conservation and propagation of equines through ecotourism has recently been initiated. The elite Marwari of Rajasthan,  Kathiawari horses of Gujarat,  Zanskari horses  of Ladakh and Manipuri horses of Manipur and Poitou donkeys of France are bred here. An Equine Information Centre and a Museum has been developed for the depicting the basic technical details about the horses. Cryopreservation of semen, artificial insemination, ultrasonography and endoscopy of equines is routinely carried out here.

==Mandate==
* To undertake research on health and production management in equines.
* To develop diagnostic/biologicals for major equine diseases and to act as national referral facilities for diagnosis, surveillance and monitoring of equine diseases and to provide diagnostic, advisory and consultancy service.

[[Image:OTEC in Hawaii.jpg|thumb|243px|right|View of the facility]]
{{Renewable energy sources}}
The '''Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority''' (NELHA) administers the Hawaii Ocean Science and Technology Park (HOST Park). NELHA was founded in 1974. At {{convert|870|acre}}, HOST Park is perhaps the largest single green economic development project in the world solely devoted to growing a green economy. NELHA also administers a small site, {{convert|4|acre}}, in Puna on the eastern side of the Island of Hawaii for geothermal research. The original mission was for research into the uses of [[Deep ocean water|Deep Ocean Water]] in [[Ocean thermal energy conversion]] (OTEC) [[renewable energy]] production and in [[aquaculture]]. It later added research into sustainable uses of natural energy sources such as [[solar energy]].
Its administration offices are located in the HOST Park [[Keahole Point]] in the [[Kona District, Hawaii|North Kona District]].
The entrance is on the [[Hawaii Belt Road]] at coordinates {{coord|19|42|58|N|156|02|01|W|display=title,inline|region:US-HI_type:landmark}}, just south of the [[Kona International Airport]].  The main administration office is in the 4 acre research campus at the end of the road along the coastline on Keahole Point.

The laboratory was founded in 1974 with {{convert|345|acre}}, associated with the [[University of Hawaii]]. Large pipelines pump cold sea water from a depth of {{convert|3000|ft}}. For three months in 1979, a small amount of electricity was generated. A larger plant was constructed in the &lt;ref name=april2009/&gt; Almost $250M was spent on Ocean thermal energy conversion, but by 1991, the research shifted to other areas. The adjacent Science and Technology Park was merged into the facility, expanding it to {{convert|877|acre}}. A [[neutrino]] detector was partially constructed in the 1990s called [[Project DUMAND]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phys.hawaii.edu/dmnd/dumand.html DUMAND web site] at the University of Hawaii&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, {{convert|50|acre}} were leased to a commercial company which filters and bottles the water for sale in Japan.&lt;ref name=dags&gt;[http://www.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/20090531/BUSINESS13/905310347 Natural Energy Lab ready for fresh start with DAGS] in [[Honolulu Advertiser]], May 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
The pipelines were broken in the October 15, [[2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake|2006 earthquake]], but one of the three has been repaired over two years later.
Makai Ocean Engineering, working with [[Lockheed Martin]], restarted OTEC research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.makai.com/p-otec.htm "Deep Pipelines for Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion"] on Makai Ocean Engineering web site&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aquaculture]], [[biofuel from algae]], [[solar thermal energy]], [[Solar concentrator|solar concentrating]] and [[wind power]] are some of the 40 tenants.&lt;ref name=april2009&gt;[http://www.westhawaiitoday.com/articles/2009/04/26/features/features01.txt Revisiting NELHA ] in [[West Hawaii Today]], April 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11933">'''Novim''' is a non-profit group at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] that organizes teams for objective scientific study of global issues and identification options for addressing the concerns, based upon an collaborative problem-solving approach used in the field of physics.

== Overview ==
The group was formed at the University of California campus in Santa Barbara to create a collaborative problem-solving approach to address widespread and complicated problems, modeled after approaches at the [[Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics]] (KITP). Novim organizes study teams of scientists, researchers, and area experts to evaluate issues like [[climate engineering]], [[global surface temperature]]s, and [[Environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing in the United States|methane leakage]]s in [[natural gas]] production. Their criteria for issue selection is that it must be "highly complex, controversial and global." They partner with governmental organizations, like the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and [[Office of Science]], to engage them in the process, share findings and discuss potential actions.&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.noozhawk.com/article/011410_undersecretary_of_science_talks_sustainability_at_ucsb/|title= Undersecretary for Science Talks Sustainability at UCSB|date=2010-01-14|accessdate=2010-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fernandez&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.noozhawk.com/article/090609_novim_global_issues/|title= Novim Aims to Close Information Gap on Pressing Global Issues|date=2009-09-06|accessdate=2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geoengineering Study===
They first studied the changes in the Earth's average surface temperature and published their findings in 2009 in the ''Climate Engineering Study Group'' report.{{#tag:ref|The [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis| International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)]] announced Novim's first report in August 2009.&lt;ref name="IIASA" /&gt;|group="nb"}} They found that there was a need to use [[climate engineering|geoengineering]] to lower the Earth's average temperature and suggested adopting the principles of short wave climate engineering (SWCE) to introduce aerosols into the stratosphere. Much like the sulfur particles released by large volcanic eruptions, the aerosols would reflect shortwave solar radiation back into space to cool the air and land below.&lt;ref name="IIASA"&gt;[http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/INF/PR/2009/2009-08-03.html Climate intervention: what we need to know to respond to a climate emergency]&lt;/ref&gt; Although SWCE may help reverse global warming, the technique remains untested and potential adverse effects are unknown, and therefore could not be mitigated.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Tirone, [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ah33HPW4.Jr8 "Geo-Engineering Risks Weigh on Hopes to Reverse Global Warming"], [https://www.bloomberg.com/ ''Bloomberg''], Published 3 August 2009, Retrieved 14 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents have stated that the core causes are not addressed, only the symptoms, and that SWCE would damage the ozone.&lt;ref&gt;Hands Off Mother Earth, [http://www.handsoffmotherearth.org/learn-more/what-is-geoengineering/sulphate-aerosols-artificial-volcanoes/ "Sulphate Aerosols &amp; Artificial volcanoes"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methane Leakage ===
Methane Leakage - Novim has assembled a team of scientific and technical experts to analyze existing studies of the emissions profile of natural gas during the production and distribution phases, with a focus on determining a range of actual methane leakage rates. Probable causes for the leakage will be included, and proposed solutions will be examined, along with associated costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phase I Meta Study of Methane Leakage|url=http://www.novim.org/projects/natural-gas|publisher=Novim|accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Palm Center''' is a [[think tank]] founded in 1998 at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], that produces scholarship designed to improve the quality of public dialogue about critical and controversial [[public policy]] issues. It commissions and disseminates research in the areas of gender, sexuality, and the military that has been published in leading social scientific journals and cited in the press. The Palm Center is a resource for university-affiliated as well as independent scholars, students, journalists, opinion leaders, and members of the public.

At its founding in 1998, it was known as the Center for the Study of [[Sexual minorities|Sexual Minorities]] in the Military. It was renamed in 2006 in recognition of a one million dollar endowment gift from the Michael D. Palm Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronoicle of Philanthropy'': [http://philanthropy.com/article/Philanthropys-Military/128431/ Anthony Bowen and Andrew Lane, "End of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” Is a Victory for Philanthropy," July 26, 2011], accessed February 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palm Center's research has been cited on the floor of Congress and covered by newspapers and radio and television stations throughout the world. Palm scholars have delivered briefings and lectures at the [[British Ministry of Defence]], the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point, the [[United States Naval Academy]], the [[United States Air Force Academy]], the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]] and the [[National Defense University]].

The director of the Palm Center is [[Aaron Belkin]].&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/us/26bcjames.html Scott James, "Celebration of Gay Pride Masks Community in Transition," June 25, 2011], accessed February 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arithmetic by species ==
=== Venus flytrap ===
[[File:Dionaea muscipula closing trap animation.gif|thumb|right|300px|A closing trap]]
The [[Venus flytrap]] can count to two and five in order to trap and then digest its prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Böhm|first1=Jennifer|last2=Scherzer|first2=Sönke|last3=Krol|first3=Elzbieta|last4=Kreuzer|first4=Ines|last5=von Meyer|first5=Katharina|last6=Lorey|first6=Christian|last7=Mueller|first7=Thomas D.|last8=Shabala|first8=Lana|last9=Monte|first9=Isabel|last10=Solano|first10=Roberto|last11=Al-Rasheid|first11=Khaled A.S.|last12=Rennenberg|first12=Heinz|last13=Shabala|first13=Sergey|last14=Neher|first14=Erwin|last15=Hedrich|first15=Rainer|title=The Venus Flytrap Dionaea muscipula Counts Prey-Induced Action Potentials to Induce Sodium Uptake|journal=Current Biology|date=February 2016|volume=26|issue=3|pages=286–295|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.11.057|pmid=26804557|pmc=4751343|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982215015018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Venus flytrap is a [[carnivorous plant]] that catches its prey with a trapping structure formed by the terminal portion of each of the plant's leaves, which is triggered by tiny hairs on their inner surfaces. When an insect or spider crawling along the leaves contacts a hair, the trap prepares to close, snapping shut only if a second contact occurs within approximately twenty seconds of the first strike. The requirement of redundant triggering in this mechanism serves as a safeguard against wasting energy by trapping objects with no nutritional value, and the plant will only begin digestion after five more stimuli to ensure it has caught a live bug worthy of consumption.

The mechanism is so highly specialized that it can distinguish between living prey and non-prey stimuli, such as falling raindrops;&lt;ref name="PRS"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Peter H.|last1=Raven|first2=Ray Franklin|last2= Evert |first3=Susan E.|last3=Eichhorn|title=Biology of Plants|edition=7th |publisher= W.H. Freeman and Company|year= 2005|isbn=978-0-7167-1007-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; two trigger hairs must be touched in succession within 20 seconds of each other or one hair touched twice in rapid succession,&lt;ref name="PRS"/&gt; whereupon the lobes of the trap will snap shut, typically in about one-tenth of a second.&lt;ref name=how&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forterre |first1=Yoël |first2=Jan M. |last2=Skotheim |first3=Jacques |last3=Dumais |first4=L. |last4=Mahadevan |date=27 January 2005 |url=http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/dumais/Publications/Nature2005.pdf |title=How the Venus flytrap snaps |format=PDF |journal=Nature |volume=433 |pages=421–425 |doi=10.1038/nature03185 |pmid=15674293 |issue=7024 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202201809/http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/dumais/Publications/Nature2005.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' ===
[[File:Arabidopsis thaliana.jpg|right|200px|''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'']]
''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' performs division to control [[starch]] use at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ledford|first1=Heidi|title=Plants perform molecular maths|journal=Nature|date=24 June 2013|doi=10.1038/nature.2013.13251|url=http://www.nature.com/news/plants-perform-molecular-maths-1.13251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most plants accumulate starch by day, then metabolize it at a fixed rate during night time. However, if the onset of darkness is unusually early, ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' reduces its use of starch by an amount that effectively requires division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scialdone|first1=Antonio|last2=Mugford|first2=Sam T|last3=Feike|first3=Doreen|last4=Skeffington|first4=Alastair|last5=Borrill|first5=Philippa|last6=Graf|first6=Alexander|last7=Smith|first7=Alison M|last8=Howard|first8=Martin|title=Arabidopsis plants perform arithmetic division to prevent starvation at night|journal=eLife|date=25 June 2013|volume=2|pages=e00669|doi=10.7554/eLife.00669|pmid=23805380|pmc=3691572|url=https://elifesciences.org/content/2/e00669}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are alternative explanations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webb|first1=A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2997">'''Problem books''' are [[textbooks]], usually at advanced undergraduate or post-graduate level, in which the material is organized as a series of problems, each with a complete solution given.  Problem books are distinct from [[workbook]]s in that the problems are designed as a primary means of teaching, not merely for practice on material learned elsewhere.  Problem books are found most often in the mathematical and physical sciences; they have a strong tradition within the Russian educational system.&lt;ref name=cahn&gt; Sidney B. Cahn and Boris E. Nadgorny (1994) ''A Guide to Physics Problems'', Plenum, vol. 2, p. vii (Preface).&lt;/ref&gt;

At some American universities, problem books are associated with departmental preliminary or candidacy examinations for the [[Doctor of philosophy|Ph.D. degree]].  Such books may exemplify decades of actual examinations and, when published, are studied by graduate students at other institutions.&lt;ref name=cahn/&gt;  Other problem books are specific to graduate fields of study. While certain problem books are collected, written, or edited by worthy but little-known toilers, others are done by renowned scholars and researchers.

The [[casebook]] for law and other non-technical fields can provide a similar function.

It has been required reading at many film schools, including the [[University of Southern California|University of Southern California (USC)]].&lt;ref name="USC"&gt;{{cite web|title=SYLLABUS: MuIN 499, The Recording Console|url=http://web-app.usc.edu/soc/syllabus/20143/44388.pdf|website=[[University of Southern California]] (USC)|accessdate=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was also awarded five out of five stars by ''[[Videomaker Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="VM3rdEd"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parr|first1=Morgan|title=New Titles Reviews|work=[[Videomaker Magazine]]|issue=September, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When released, ''Millimeter Magazine'' noted that the book was one of very few publications extensively covering the art of capturing motion picture sound.&lt;ref name="Mil"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Katz|first1=S.D.|title=Essential Reading for DV Filmmakers|work=Millimeter Magazine|date=February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Producing Great Sound for Film and Video'' has been called, "...''the'' book on the subject."&lt;ref name="Stockman2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Stockman|title=How to Shoot Video That Doesn't Suck|page=247|year=2011|publisher=Workman Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-7611-6323-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
In the opening of the book, Rose states:  
&lt;blockquote&gt;The heart of this book is the tricks, shortcuts and industry practices developed over nearly a century, since the beginning of radio and talking pictures.  In the 40-some years I've been at this, I've worked on tracks ranging from sales videos to theatrical features...and seen my projects win Clios, an Emmy, and hundreds of other awards...This book is an attempt to share as much as I can.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
''Producing Great Sound for Film and Video'' is broken into four main sections, ordered to reflect real-world filming situations:  
*Audio Basics
*Planning and Pre-Production
*Production Sound
*Post Production

Subjects covered include [[Analog recording|analog]] versus [[digital audio]], [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]] and using [[sound effect]]s, microphone techniques, [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|ADR]], [[Audio mixing|mixing]], and [[Audio mastering|mastering]].

One section highlighted as unique by ''[[Videomaker Magazine]]'' was that on "editing voices."&lt;ref name="VM3rdEd" /&gt;  Rose breaks down how human speech works, and how that translates to film and video productions.  Tips include stealing unvoiced sounds from other characters or people speaking in a scene, and using them to replace problematic recordings of others.  The "editing voices" section also discusses sounds with "hard attacks" and training the ear to hear [[phoneme]]s, which helps in isolating and correcting speech recording issues.

Numerous "recipes" for dealing with common sound issues, such as reducing or eliminating echo on sets, and removing line hum and buzz from recorded audio, are also provided.

Eliva Silva writing for ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'' said of the book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[It is] the whole theory -- and beautiful theory -- on the science of audio and the way that audio is recorded through voltage, converted into digital information, back to voltage into sound.&lt;ref name="SAE"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silva|first1=Eliva|title=So Whatcha Doin'? Pablo Véliz|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/11358CB5E1908398?p=AWNB|work=San Antonio Express-News|date=August 6, 2006|accessdate=February 15, 2016|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fIoToQCM|archivedate=February 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Style ==
Author Rose states in the book that he wishes to appeal to technical and non-technical people alike, adding he hopes to keep the book approachable and conversational in tone, dispelling the idea that audio needs to be difficult to understand.  He states that audio is not "rocket science." While the book does contain math and science, Rose points out the math is elementary school level and the physics is "common sense."

The current version of the book provides downloadable files including sample sounds and music, diagnostic tools and additional tutorials allowing the reader to practice with the principles explained. Earlier versions of the book included a CD-ROM of similar assets.

In 2003, ''Millimeter Magazine'' felt the style was right for the time:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Digital artists are very much hands-on, and Rose is the right man to write audio books for this new generation of filmmakers. Rose operates his own boutique sound studio and bridges the analog and digital eras - he's made the discoveries and mistakes that no one should have to learn on the job. This direct experience with DV equipment and projects is apparent throughout the book.&lt;ref name="Mil" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Classroom use ==

== Reception ==

=== Critical reviews ===
Covering the first edition of the book, ''[[Videomaker Magazine]]'' noted the high price tag of the book, but said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;With PBS and Turner Network Television production experience under his belt, author Jay Rose brings a wealth of experience to ''Producing Great Sound for Digital Video''...the book is replete with facts and useful information.&lt;ref name="VideoMaker1stEd" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of the second edition, ''Millimeter Magazine'' said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Shortchanging film sound is typical of new filmmakers, and the emphasis on picture over sound is a bias running through film schools and film publications - articles, books, and courses on visual subjects far outnumber those on film sound. Author Jay Rose is single-handedly addressing the problem.&lt;ref name="Mil" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John Hartney writing for ''[[Creative COW]]'' said of the second edition, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;...it offers such a wide range of usable information about hands-on digital audio production, that by reading it, the reader is empowered with production skills and enlightened by an appreciation of how the experience of audio enriches video.&lt;ref name="COW"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hartney|first1=John|title=John Hartney reviews: Producing Great Sound for Digital Video, Second edition|url=https://library.creativecow.net/articles/hartney_john/jay_rose_audio.php|website=[[Creative COW]]|accessdate=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2008, covering the third edition of the book, ''[[Videomaker Magazine]]'' awarded it "five out of five stars" and said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have been looking for this book for 20 years - no exaggeration...The chapter on Editing Voices alone is worth the price tag.&lt;ref name="VM3rdEd" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Entertainment industry reviews ===
Academy Award winner [[Randy Thom]] (director of Sound Design at [[Skywalker Sound]],&lt;ref name="SkySoundThmo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Randy Thom|url=http://www.skysound.com/people/randy-thom/|website=[[Skywalker Sound]]|accessdate=January 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oscar winner for ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'' and ''[[The Incredibles]]''&lt;ref name="IMDBThom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Randy Thom - Awards|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0858378/awards|website=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=January 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) wrote praise of the author and book:

'''Sex for Fish''' sometimes referred to as "Fish for Sex" is a phenomenon in which female traders engage in sexual relationships with fishermen to secure their supply of fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2007.05.010 |title=Women and Fish-for-Sex: Transactional Sex, HIV/AIDS and Gender in African Fisheries |year=2008 |last1=Béné |first1=Christophe |last2=Merten |first2=Sonja |journal=World Development |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=875–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women fish traders are often pressured into having sex with the fishermen who supply them with daily fresh fish. Along the beaches where the sex for fish practices have been observed, the fishermen do maintain several transactional sexual relationships with women at different beaches where they land with their fish.
 
Sex for Fish as a phenomenon is common in many low and middle income developing countries; however, the bulk cases have been observed in Sub-Saharan Africa’s inland fisheries. The most vulnerable victims are economically disadvantaged women, e.g. single or divorced women as well as widows residing in along the shores of inland fisheries centers.

Several social-economic factors including poverty, cultural practices, and competition among women who are involved in fish trade are often listed as variables fueling the sex for fish practice. There is no conclusive research that shows what promotes sex for fish practice, however, fishermen seem to be taking advantage of stiff competition between the women who trade in fish to demand sexual favors in exchange for the fish. The men or the trader who receives sexual favors would grant preferential sale and sale at reduced prices to these women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Cg7UT6fBpk |title=Sex for Fish - Kenya |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the shores of [[Lake Victoria]] in [[Kenya]], women have been observed giving out empty polythene bags to the fishermen before they go out fishing at night or early morning, and when the fishermen return, some of the best catch would be set aside for them, stashed in these bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1521/aeap.2013.25.3.216 |title=Jaboyavs.Jakambi: Status, Negotiation, and HIV Risks Among Female Migrants in the "Sex for Fish" Economy in Nyanza Province, Kenya |year=2013 |last1=Camlin |first1=Carol S. |last2=Kwena |first2=Zachary A. |last3=Dworkin |first3=Shari L. |journal=AIDS Education and Prevention |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=216–31 |pmid=23631716 |pmc=3717412}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fishermen take advantage of these economically and social disadvantaged women by offering preferential treatment in fish business in exchange for sex.

==Poverty==
In Kenya where sex for fish has been well documented, poverty among the fishing communities has been constantly listed as factors contributing to the practice of sex for fish. Sex for fish practice in Kenya is popularly referred to as Jaboya system. Jaboya in Luo tribe dialect means customer, however, due to the transactional involvement of fishermen with women fish traders, the locals coined the term Jaboya system to refer to sex for fish phenomenon. Fishmongers in lake side city of [[Kisumu]], have sex with fishermen to get stock to sell in order to make a living. They have alluded to having children to feed and having to pay rent and school fees as drivers for exchange of sex for fish. In Kenya’s third largest city of Kisumu, Dunga Beach along the shores of Lake Victoria young girls have become the new attraction for fishermen who use their fish catch as a bait to lure these vulnerable group into sex for fish practice fees.&lt;ref name="irinnews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/country/ke/kenya |title=IRIN &amp;#124; Africa &amp;#124; East Africa &amp;#124; Kenya |publisher=Irinnews.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle of poverty and vulnerable ensures that older women introduces their younger daughters or orphaned girls to sex for fish trade. In return the young girl sleeps with the fisherman that offers the best deal. In many cases the young girls do have sex with multiple partners and are exposed to STD’s and potentially HIV infections.&lt;ref name="irinnews1" /&gt;

==Exploitation of gay men==
In September 2012, a Kenyan TV station reported incidents where gay men exchange sex for fish. This occurs due to poor catch or for money. The economically weak gay men have been become the latest group to be involved in sex for fish within the fishing communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://identitykenya.com/index.php/daily-news/709-anal-sex-for-fish-in-kisumu-the-invisible-bridge-final-part |title=Anal Sex For Fish In Kisumu: The Invisible Bridge Final Part |publisher=Identitykenya.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217090019/http://identitykenya.com/index.php/daily-news/709-anal-sex-for-fish-in-kisumu-the-invisible-bridge-final-part |archivedate=2013-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HIV/AIDS prevalence==
Some of the earliest recorded cases of [[HIV/AIDS]] in Africa were in fishing communities around Lake Victoria in 1982. Several studies have shown a link between sex for fish phenomenon and higher HIV prevalence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qui1whVeqX4 |title=Sex for fish: How fishing is fueling the spread of HIV/Aids in Homabay |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-12-26 |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kenya]], it is assumed that ‘Sex for Fish’ contributes to the high HIV/AIDS prevalence along the lake region, where it is double the national average.&lt;ref name="irinnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="irinnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtzpsda.co.ke/download.php?filename=psda_downloads/_Menn%20%20Anyango_vf.pdf&amp;name=_Menn%20%20Anyango_vf.pdf |title=Omena fishery and 'Sex for Fish' at Lake Victoria |publisher=Gtzpsda.co.ke |accessdate=2013-11-23 |author=Dr. Iris Menn and Elizabeth Anyango}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenya Modes of Transmission Study 2008 had put prevalence in the fishing communities at between 25 percent and 30 percent in Nyanza province in Kenya.&lt;ref name="irinnews1"/&gt; This prevalence level was double Nyanza province in general infection rate of 15.3 percent, which was nearly the national average. The effect of HIV transmission is made worse by the fact that these women have no control over the use of condoms as a preventive measure against the spread of the HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.

In [[Uganda]], studies conducted around [[Lake George (Uganda)|Lake George]] and [[Lake Edward]] by the [[Uganda Fisheries and Fish Conservation Association]] (UFFCA), found that the HIV/AIDS prevalence average rate was at 22.4 percent against the national prevalence of 7.3 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pancap.org/en/news-global/1723-uganda-sex-for-fish-common-as-hiv-reaches-22-percent.html |title=Uganda: 'Sex for Fish' Common As HIV Reaches 22 Percent |publisher=Pancap.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex for fish is considered by many leaders and researchers as one of the reasons that have led to higher than average HIV/AIDS prevalence amongst these fisher communities.

In [[Mangochi]], [[Malawi]], sex is a vibrant part of fishing and research has shown a strong link between HIV prevalence and sex for fish trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.7448/IAS.15.3.17364 |title=Transactional sex and HIV: Understanding the gendered structural drivers of HIV in fishing communities in Southern Malawi |year=2012 |last1=MacPherson |first1=Eleanor E |last2=Sadalaki |first2=John |last3=Njoloma |first3=Macdonald |last4=Nyongopa |first4=Victoria |last5=Nkhwazi |first5=Lawrence |last6=Mwapasa |first6=Victor |last7=Lalloo |first7=David G |last8=Desmond |first8=Nicola |last9=Seeley |first9=Janet |last10=Theobald |first10=Sally |journal=Journal of the International AIDS Society |volume=15 |issue=3 Suppl 1 |pmid=22713352 |pages=1–9 |pmc=3499929}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transactional sex is common in Malawian fishing communities, with women identified as vulnerable in negotiations because of existing gendered power structures.  Men carrying out the fishing, therefore men controls factors of production, and women processing, drying and selling the fish. The control of factors of production by men, the power dynamics in these exchanges favour men and make it more difficult for women to negotiate safe sex.
The Malawian NGO, [[Youth Net and Counselling]] (YONECO) that works to combat the spread of HIV infection in Malawi, observed that despite increased awareness on HIV and AIDS in Malawi, fishermen on Lake Chilwa are queuing for sex. This was disclosed by fishermen who were trained by YONECO as peer educators during a monitoring visit the organization made to Mposa in Machinga district. The reports indicate that a total of 25 fishermen would line up to have sex with one woman in exchange of 15 dozen fish if no condom is used during sexual intercourse or 3 dozen fish if a condom is used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7WF4OJaG0#t=82]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Kafue Flats]] region of [[Zambia]] sex for fish exchange increased the spread of HIV/AIDS rapidly between the years 2002-2005.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Interventions==

===U.S. Peace Corps===
In 2010, two [[Peace Corps]] volunteers, Dominik Mucklow and Michael Geilhufe who lived near Lake Victoria decided to do something to help the women who were trapped in sex for fish practice. With support from the U.S. [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR) funding, they assisted a group of women fish traders to acquire their own fishing boats. The women then employed men to go fishing using these boats. This simple advancement allowed women to be free from sexual exploitation in order to secure their fish supply.&lt;ref name="worldconnect-us1"&gt;{{cite web|author=World Connect, US |url=http://www.worldconnect-us.org/discoverprojects/sex-fish-nyamware/ |title=No Sex for Fish: Nyamware &amp;#124; World Connect |publisher=Worldconnect-us.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No sex for fish aimed to change the work dynamic between the women and the men who make their living from the fishing industry by giving women ownership of the means of production, boats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/94497/Kenya-Helping-Wowen-to-end-sex-for-fish-culture |title=IRIN Africa &amp;#124; KENYA: Helping women to end sex-for-fish culture &amp;#124; Kenya &amp;#124; Economy &amp;#124; Gender Issues &amp;#124; HIV/AIDS (PlusNews) &amp;#124; Prevention - PlusNews |publisher=Irinnews.org |date=2011-12-19 |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women own the boats, as the women work they repay the cost of building the boat, then the boat repayment money is pooled to construct more boats; increasing the number of women involved. The pilot project was managed by the [[Victoria Institute for Research on Environment and Development]] (Vired).&lt;ref name="worldconnect-us1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-26186194 Kenya's battle to end 'sex for fish' trade], BBC News, Mark Lowen, 17 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merlin===
An organization that brings together local leaders and community members, Merlin has created several theatre groups in Western Kenya that perform skits and plays that deal with the issues that the sex for fish (Jaboya System) practice brings. The shows take place once per month, and coincide with the return of the fishermen to the beach. The shows typically draw large crowds on the beach, and end with a discussion, as well as condom distribution to the fishermen. Local people believe that the shows are getting the local community to change their thinking about the Jaboya system, and ultimately their behaviour as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Okwiri|first=Caroline|title=Jaboya System|url=http://www.jaluo.com/wangwach/1106/Caroline_Okwiri111506.html|accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Deadly Catch'' film==
''Deadly Catch'' is a film that was produced by [[IRIN]] that centers around the fishing community located outside of [[Bondo, Kenya]]. It shows how the HIV virus has affected different people in various ways, focusing on those both directly involved with the jaboya system, and those that have lost family members due to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=KENYA: Deadly Catch: Lake Victoria's AIDS crisis|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=61001|accessdate=28 January 2012|newspaper=IRIN|date=10 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], a '''spirangle''' is a figure related to a [[spiral]].  Spirangles are similar to spirals in that they expand from a center point as they grow larger, but they are made out of straight [[line segment]]s, instead of curves. Spirangle [[vectograph]]s are used in vision therapy to promote [[stereopsis]] and help resolve problems with [[hand–eye coordination]].

==Two-dimensional spirangles==
A two-dimensional spirangle is an open figure consisting of a line bent into angles similar to a corresponding [[polygon]].  The spirangle can start at a center point, or a distance from the center, and has some number of turns around the center point.

==Three-dimensional spirangles==
Three-dimensional spirangles have layers that slant upward, progressively gaining height from the previous segment.  This is similar to staircases in large buildings that turn at the top of each flight.  The segments also may progressively lose an amount of length and resemble a pyramid.

==Uses==

[[Ophthalmology]] – vectograms

[[Electronics]] – printed [[inductor]]s

[[Architecture]] – ‘spiral’ [[staircase]]s

[[Jewelry]] – earrings, pendants

[[Search Algorithm]]s - efficient scanning of a region of interest (crime scenes, astronomical regions, etc.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8892">Soil '''tilth''' is its physical condition of soil, especially in relation to its suitability for planting or growing a crop. Factors that determine tilth include the formation and stability of aggregated soil particles, moisture content, degree of aeration, rate of water infiltration and drainage. Tilth can change rapidly, depending on environmental factors such as changes in moisture, tillage and [[Soil conditioner|soil amendments]]. The objective of tillage (mechanical manipulation of the soil) is to improve tilth, thereby increasing crop production; in the long term, however, conventional tillage, especially plowing, often has the opposite effect, causing the soil to break down and become compacted. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tilth|url = http://www.britannica.com/science/tilth|accessdate = 2015-09-10|website = Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil with good tilth has large pore spaces for air infiltration and water movement. Roots only grow where the soil tilth allows for adequate levels of soil oxygen. Such soil also holds a reasonable supply of water and nutrients.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Managing Soil Tilth: Texture, Structure and Pore Space|url = http://www.ext.colostate.edu/mg/gardennotes/213.html|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110119004705/http://www.ext.colostate.edu/mg/gardennotes/213.html|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2011-01-19|website = www.ext.colostate.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-10|first = David|last = Whiting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tillage]], organic matter amendments, fertilization and irrigation can each improve tilth, but when used excessively, can have the opposite effect.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Crop rotation]] and [[cover crop]]s can positively impact tilth. A combined approach can produce the greatest improvement.

== Aggregation ==
Aggregation is positively associated with tilth. With finer-textured soils, aggregates may in turn be made up of smaller aggregates. Aggregation implies substantial pores between individual aggregates.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Crop Rotation and Soil Tilth|url = http://www.sare.org/Learning-Center/Books/Crop-Rotation-on-Organic-Farms/Text-Version/Physical-and-Biological-Processes-In-Crop-Production/Crop-Rotation-and-Soil-Tilth|website = www.sare.org|accessdate = 2015-09-10|first = Harold|last = Van Es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggregation is important in the subsoil, the layer below tillage. Such aggregates involve larger (2- to 6-inch) blocks of soil that are more angular and not as distinctive. These aggregates are less impacted by biological activity than the tillage layer. Subsurface aggregates are important for root growth deep into the profile. Deep roots allow greater access to moisture, which helps in drought periods. Subsoil aggregates can also be compacted, mainly by heavy equipment on wet soil. Another significant source of subsoil compaction is the practice of plowing with tractor wheels in the open furrow.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Pore size ==
Soil that is well aggregated has a range of pore sizes. Each pore size plays a role in soil's physical functioning. Large pores drain rapidly and are needed for good air exchange during wet periods, preventing oxygen deficiency that can drown plants and increase pest problems. Denitrification by conversion of nitrogen to gaseous forms is increased in oxygen-deficient wet soil. In degraded soil large pores are compressed into small ones.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Small pores are critical for water retention and help a crop endure dry periods with minimal yield loss.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Management ==
Soil tilth can be obtained through mechanical and biological manipulation.

=== Tillage ===
Mechanical soil cultivation practices, including primary tillage (mold-board or chisel plowing) followed by secondary tillage (disking, [[Harrow (tool)|harrowing]], etc.), break up and aerate soil. When soils become degraded and compacted, such tillage practices are often deemed necessary. The tilth created by tillage, however, tends to be ''unstable'', because the aggregation is obtained through the physical manipulation of the soil, which is short lived, especially after years of intensive tillage. Aggregates in such soils readily dissolve during subsequent rains, causing the soil to settle and become dense and hard, requiring further tillage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Biological ===
The preferred scenario for good tilth is as the result of natural soil-building processes, provided by the activity of plant roots, microorganisms, earthworms and other beneficial organisms. Such stable aggregates break apart during tillage/planting and readily provide good tilth. Stable aggregates are held together by organic bonds that resist breakdown during soil saturation. These organic materials are themselves subject to biological degradation, requiring active amendments with organic material, and minimal mechanical tillage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Rotation ===
Crop rotation can help restore tilth in compacted soils. Two processes contribute to this gain. First, accelerated organic matter decomposition from tillage ends under the sod crop. Another way to achieve this is via [[no-till farming]]. Second, grass and legume sods develop extensive root systems that continually grow and die off. The dead roots supply a source of active organic matter, which feeds soil organisms that create aggregation. Beneficial organisms need continual supplies of organic matter to sustain themselves and they deposit the digested materials on soil aggregates and thereby stabilize them. Also, the living roots and symbiotic microorganisms (for example, [[mycorrhiza]]l fungi) can exude organic materials that nourish soil organisms and help with aggregation. Grass and legume sod crops therefore return more organic matter to the soil than most other crops.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some annual rotation crops such as [[Polygonaceae|buckwheat]] also have dense, fibrous, root systems and can improve tilth. Crop mixtures with different rooting systems can be beneficial. For example, [[Trifolium pratense|red clover]] seeded into [[winter wheat]] provide additional roots and a more protein-rich organic matter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Other rotation crops are more valuable for improving subsoils. Perennial crops such as [[alfalfa]] have strong, deep, penetrating tap roots that can push through hard layers, especially during wet periods when the soil is soft. These deep roots establish pathways for water and future plant roots, and produce organic matter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Crops rotation can extend the period of active growth compared to conventional row crops, leaving more organic material behind. For example, in a corn-soybean rotation, active growth occurs 32 percent of the time, while a dry bean–winter wheat–corn rotation is active 72 percent. Crops such as rye, wheat, oat, barley, pea and cool-season grasses grow actively in the late fall and early spring when other crops are inactive. They are beneficial both as rotation and cover crops, although intensive tillage can negate their effects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Soil types ==
The soil management practices required to maintain soil tilth are a function of the type of soil. Sandy and gravelly soils are naturally deficient in small pores and are therefore drought prone, whereas loams and clays can retain and thus supply crops with more water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Coarse-textured, sandy soils ===
Sandy soil has lower capacity to hold water and nutrients. Water is applied more frequently in smaller amounts to avoid it leaching and carrying nutrients below the root zone. Routine application of organic matter increases sandy soil's ability to hold water and nutrients by 10 times or more.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Fine-textured, clay soils ===
Clay soils lack large pores, restricting both water and air movement.  During irrigation or rain events, the limited large pore space in fine-textured soils quickly fills with water, reducing soil oxygen levels. In addition to routine application of organic matter, microorganisms and earthworms perform a crucial assist to soil tilth. As microorganisms decompose the organic matter, soil particles bind together into larger aggregates, increasing large pore space. Clay soils are more subject to soil compaction, which reduces large pore spaces''.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Gravelly and decomposed granite soils ===
Such soils natively have little tilth, especially once they have been disturbed. Adding organic matter up to 25% by volume can help compensate. For example, if tilling to a depth of eight inches, add two inches of organic materials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Transmediation''' is the process of translating a work into a different medium. The definition of what constitutes transmediation would depend on how medium is defined or interpreted. In [[Understanding Media|Understanding media]], [[Marshall McLuhan]] offered a quite broad of medium "an extension of ourselves": &lt;blockquote&gt;"In a culture like ours, long accustomed to splitting and dividing all things as a means of control, it is sometimes a bit of a shock to be reminded that, in operational and practical fact, the medium is the message. This is merely to say that the personal and social consequences of any medium - that is, of any extension of ourselves - result from the new scale that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves, or by any new technology." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/30734000|title=Understanding media : the extensions of man|last=1911-1980.|first=McLuhan, Marshall,|others=Lapham, Lewis H.,|isbn=0262631598|edition=First MIT Press edition, 1994|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=30734000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;From McLuhan's definition, it is possible to infer the definition of transmediation could involve at least two different dimensions: a [[sensory]]{{dn|date=October 2018}} &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peña|first=Ernesto|last2=James|first2=Kedrick|date=2018-04-10|title=Raw Harmonies: Transmediation through raw data|url=https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/LEON_a_01635|journal=Leonardo|language=en|pages=1–12|doi=10.1162/leon_a_01635|issn=0024-094X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Semiotics|semiotic]] translation. When referring to medium as a sensory mode, transmediation would require to move between sensory modes (e.g., visual to aural, aural to tactile). When referring to transmediation as semiotic translation, transmediation can refer to the process of "responding to cultural texts in a range of sign systems -- art, movement, sculpture, dance, music, and so on -- as well as in words." [http://www.readingonline.org/newliteracies/semali2/ Semali and Fueyo] 

Transmediation may utilize more than one media form. All the components of a transmediated work are interlinked with each other to form the whole network. Therefore, transmediated works are closely linked to semiotics and technology in the context of digital media. Transmediation can include response to traditional printed texts, as well as [[multimedia]] materials including [[video]], [[animation]], a [[website]], a [[podcast]], a [[game]], etc.

Transmediation is closely linked to [[semiotics]], which is the impact study of signs. Academic researchers and educators interested in transmediation are often also interested in [[media literacy]], [[visual literacy]], [[information literacy]], and [[critical literacy]].

[http://www.edutopia.org/magazine/ed1article.php?id=art_1361&amp;issue=oct_05 Leonard Shlain] highlights the importance of engaging students in the process of transmediation when writing, "Digital information comes in multiple forms, and students must learn to tell stories not just with words and numbers but also through images, graphics, color, sound, music, and dance. There is a grammar and literacy to each of these forms of communication. Bombarded with a wide variety of images regularly, students need sharp visual-interpretation skills to interact with the media analytically. Each form of communication has its own rules and grammar and should be taught in ways that lead students to be more purposeful, specific, and concise in communicating."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2821">A '''Walrasian auction''', introduced by [[Léon Walras]], is a type of simultaneous [[auction]] where each [[Agent (economics)|agent]] calculates its demand for the good at every possible price and submits this to an auctioneer. The price is then set so that the total demand across all agents equals the total amount of the good. Thus, a Walrasian auction perfectly matches the supply and the demand.

Walras suggests that [[General equilibrium|equilibrium]] will be achieved through a process of '''[[wikt:tâtonnement|tâtonnement]]'''{{anchor|tatonnement}} (French for "trial and error"), a form of [[hill climbing]].

==Walrasian auctioneer==
The ''Walrasian auctioneer'' is the presumed auctioneer that matches [[supply and demand]] in a market of [[perfect competition]]. The auctioneer provides for the features of perfect competition: [[perfect information]] and no [[transaction cost]]s. The process is called ''tâtonnement'', or ''groping'', relating to finding the market clearing price for all commodities and giving rise to [[general equilibrium]].

The device is an attempt to avoid one of deepest conceptual problems of perfect competition, which may, essentially, be defined by the stipulation that no agent can affect prices. But if no one can affect prices no one can change them, so prices cannot change. However, involving as it does an artificial solution, the device is less than entirely satisfactory.

==As a mistranslation==
Until Walker and van Daal's 2014 translation, William Jaffé's ''Elements of Pure Economics'' (1954) was for many years the only English translation of Walras's ''Éléments d’économie politique pure''. 

Walker and van Daal argue that the idea of the Walrasian auction and Walrasian auctioneer resulted from Jaffé's mistranslation of the French word ''crieurs'' (criers) into ''auctioneers''. Walker and van Daal call this "a momentous error that has mislead generations of readers into thinking that the markets in Walras's model are auction markets and that he assigned the function of changing prices in his model to an auctioneer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9kilBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR35&amp;lpg=PR35&amp;dq=%22a+momentous+error+that+has+mislead+generations+of+readers+into+thinking+that+the+markets+in+Walras%E2%80%99s+model+are+auction+markets+and+that+he+assigned+the+function+of+changing+prices+in+his+model+to+an+auctioneer.%22|title=Leon Walras's Elements of Theoretical Economics|last=Walras|first=Léon|date=2014-10-23|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107064133|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wild West Tech''''' is a program that aired on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] in the United States from 2003 to 2005. The show was originally hosted by [[Keith Carradine]] (2003–04), but his half-brother, [[David Carradine]], took over hosting duties for season 2 and subsequent seasons. The show illustrates a variety of technologies used in the [[Wild West]], and features interviews with numerous Western historians, as well as re-creating versions of important events in Western history.

The series was created by Dolores Gavin (History Channel) and supervising producer Louis Tarantino.

==Format==

Each episode is dedicated to some broader aspect of Wild West life. Once the context is established in brief by the host, more specific elements are developed. Throughout the program, professors, writers, and other experts explain finer points while [[historical reenactment]]s and dramatizations portray just how key 19th century events may have transpired. The production aims to put the viewer into the spirit of the Old West with its host inhabiting an unnamed frontier town, delivering commentary.

A new spin on the typical technology fact program, this program often covers subjects from the [[American Old West]] that are not generally discussed in more traditional settings. For example, one episode takes a look at the [[brothel]], focusing on the inventions and technological innovations used to make the institution of prostitution less harsh on the lives of the women involved.

Another explains that Morphine was first isolated in 1803 by the German pharmacist [[Friedrich Sertürner|Friedrich Wilhelm Adam Sertürner]], but it was not until the development of the [[hypodermic needle]] (1853) that its use spread and it spread quite a bit in the American West. It was used for pain relief and as a "cure" for opium or alcohol addiction. Its extensive use during the [[American Civil War]] resulted in over 400,000 sufferers from the "soldiers disease" (addiction).

The same episode informs the viewers that [[heroin]], along with other drugs, was only criminalized in the United States by the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]] of 1914 decades after it was derived.

Other topics include the technological histories of various alcoholic beverages, [[bar (establishment)|saloons]], weapons, and [[cowboy]] gangs.

==Episode guide==
Two pilot episodes were produced, hosted by Keith Carradine, to help sell the History Channel on the concept of the series. Seasons 2 and 3 were hosted by David Carradine.

==Trivia==
The History Channel sometimes airs re-edited versions of the episodes to fill odd bits of time on the schedule; these 30 minute versions feature no new content.

There is a video that documents how Keith lost the show to David in a [[poker]] game that appears at the beginning of episode 2–1.

Shortly before leaving the show, Keith Carradine grew a mustache for his role in the TNT production of ''[[Monte Walsh (2003)|Monte Walsh]]''.
